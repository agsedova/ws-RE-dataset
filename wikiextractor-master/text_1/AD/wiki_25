{"id": "2216000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216000", "title": "Kobra (DC Comics)", "text": "Kobra (DC Comics)\n\nKobra is the name used by two fictional supervillains published by DC Comics. The Jeffrey Burr Kobra and his brother Jason first appeared in \"Kobra\" #1 (February 1976), and were created by Jack Kirby. Jason Burr debuted as Kobra in \"Faces of Evil: Kobra\" #1 (March 2009) by Ivan Brandon and Julian Lopez.\n\nBoth Jeffrey and Jason Burr were created by Jack Kirby for a proposed DC Comics series called \"King Kobra\", the first issue of which was both written and drawn by Kirby. This first issue then sat in DC inventory for over a year, during which time Kirby left the publisher to return to Marvel Comics.\n\nEventually the concept was handed over to writer Martin Pasko with orders to make a series out of it. Pasko was unimpressed with King Kobra, feeling it to be a throwaway idea churned out by Kirby as he was preparing to leave DC, and tried to make the best out of the assignment by whiting out all of Kirby's original dialogue, rescripting the issue, and having Pablo Marcos redraw some of the art. Now titled simply \"Kobra\", the first issue of the series appeared in late 1975 (cover-dated February 1976). It was cancelled after seven issues, though the contents of the unpublished \"Kobra\" #8 saw print in \"DC Special Series\" #1. Pasko later reflected, \"I wrote all of \"Kobra\" with my tongue firmly planted in my cheek—it was a preposterous exercise dumped in my lap, and it helped pay the rent on a very nice place in the Village.\"\n\nKobra is also featured in a January 2009 \"Faces of Evil\" one-shot, written by Ivan Brandon.\n\nKobra is an international terrorist and mad scientist who has crossed paths with the majority of Earth's costumed heroes during his attempts to usher in the Kali Yuga (an age of chaos). His real name is Jeffrey Franklin Burr, and he was born part of a set of siamese twins, but was stolen at birth by the Cult of the Kobra God, since a prophecy claimed he would lead them to rule the world. Under their teaching, he became a dangerous warrior and a sadistic criminal mastermind. He led the cult into using advanced technology to menace the world. Followers of Kobra would frequently address their master as \"Naja-Naja\", \"naja naja\" being the binomial name for the Indian cobra. This later became \"Nāga-Naga\", a meaningless title which translates from the Sanskrit as \"snake-snake\". Whether this change was intentional or an error is not known.\n\nHowever, unknown to the cult, he had a psychic link to his twin brother, Jason, who knew nothing of Kobra. As a result, one felt what the other felt, including pain. Because of this, his brother was recruited by an international agency to help them combat Kobra. At first, Kobra was unable to kill or even hurt his brother; eventually, however, he used a device that \"shut off\" the psychic link, and gave him the chance to kill Jason. However, Kobra was subsequently haunted by visions of his brother. Whether it really was his ghost or just Kobra's imagination was never revealed.\n\nIn subsequent years, Kobra would clash with assorted superheroes, including Batman, whom he first met over a Lazarus Pit of his own creation. Kobra had learned to build modified Lazarus Pits, which allowed him to control the minds of those he killed and resurrected. Kobra is the only person in the DC universe ever to decipher the formula for the Lazarus Pits. Kobra had special concerns about Wonder Woman and sought to ensure her death, first by hiring a cartel of international assassins who were led secretly by corrupted UN Crisis Bureau chief Morgan Tracy (also Diana Prince's boss), then by kidnapping and irretrievably damaging environmental activist Deborah Domaine, forcibly transforming her into a new Cheetah, and ultimately, facing Wonder Woman in combat in Egypt, faking his own demise after being defeated by the Amazon Princess. A short while later his various Strike Force Kobra teams would fight two different incarnations of Batman's Outsiders. Kobra also fought the third Flash, the Suicide Squad led by Amanda Waller, the original incarnation of Checkmate, Captain Atom, a Superman whose personality had been swapped with Ambush Bug's by exposure to Red Kryptonite, and others. Kobra is one of a very small number of individuals that has the capability of defeating Batman in hand-to-hand combat, and actually did so on one occasion.\n\nThe only organization ever to rival Kobra in the old DC Universe (Pre-Crisis I) was SKULL. There were frequent recorded clashes between the two groups, the last occurring in \"Outsiders\" Annual #1 story \"The Skull...The Serpent...and The Outsiders\".\n\nAfter the betrayal of his lover Lady Eve during the Strike Force Kobra fiasco, she split Kobra in two and established her own splinter group. In the \"Power Company: Sapphire\" #1 the Justice League rushes to San Diego to prevent disaster as two rival factions of the Kobra Cult prepared to go to war. One faction was led by Eve; the other was led by Kobra himself.\n\nHe kidnaps the former hero Air Wave and uses him to seize control of the world's media and satellite resources, intending to destroy a number of major world cities. However, in a demonstration of his power, he incidentally kills Terri Rothstein, Atom Smasher's mother, ensuring the Justice Society of America's involvement. Mrs. Rothstein's life would later be saved through time travel; Atom Smasher replacing her with the villain Extant so that the same number of people died in the plane crash that killed his mother.\n\nHe appeared again in \"JSA\" #45, which featured his trial. He shrugs off claims of terrorism, claiming to be an enlightened soul (a bodhisattva) trying to free souls from their karmic debt by random acts of violence. Following this, his followers threatened to kill the media outside the courthouse with a bioengineered suicide bomb implants. Holding everyone hostage with this tactic, he was allowed by the JSA to escape, leading to an outraged Black Adam and Atom Smasher, who both subsequently choose to leave the team. In \"JSA\" #51, Atom Smasher, Black Adam, Northwind, and Brainwave track Kobra down to his headquarters in the Himalaya Mountains, Kobra's prophesied 'reign of darkness' as the world fell to the return of Eclipso and Obsidian having ended when Alex Moretz took control of Eclipso and Alan Scott managed to redeem Obsidian. After killing Kobra's guards, Black Adam rips his heart out and he died instantly.\n\nJeffrey's twin brother Jason is re-animated by the Kobra Cult, possibly through the use of Kobra's Lazarus Pits. This involves the death of an entire facility of Checkmate agents, including several of Burr's old friends. Within the one-shot Jason reveals that he is re-structuring the organization and killing off all the old members. Before revealing himself as the new Kobra, Jason spent some time undercover as a Checkmate agent learning their secrets.\n\nDuring the \"Convergence\" storyline, an unidentified Kobra leads the Kobra Cult under the alias of \"King Kobra\" and faces off against Red Hood and Arsenal.\n\nAfter Lady Eve makes off with Dr. Helga Jace upon defeating Katana during the \"DC Rebirth,\" King Kobra plans to raze a town in Markovia if they don't obey his commands. King Kobra interrogates Dr. Jace. When the Suicide Squad joins the fight and rescues Katana from Lady Eve, they and Katana find King Kobra outside Castle Markov. King Kobra later shows Dr. Jace the powers of the comatose girl that she was watching. King Kobra reveals that he caught an Aurakle as he plans to weaponize it. Before returning to the ship's command center, King Kobra leaves this task to Dr. Jace. During the Suicide Squad's fight with King Kobra's forces, Katana and Enchantress find that King Kobra had Dr. Jace fuse Violet Harper with the Aurakle as King Kobra activates the implant in Violet's neck only for Violet to tear it out as the Aurakle gains control of Violet's body. King Kobra, Katana, and Enchantress fight Violet who is now a vessel for the Aurakles under the name of Halo. After Katana uses the Soultaker on Lady Eve, King Kobra gets away.\n\nIn the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock,\" King Kobra's cult has captured Creeper until he is \"saved\" by Black Adam.\n\n\nKobra researched every villain that ever fought Batman and how they each acquired their respective powers. After obtaining some test subjects, Kobra had his researchers use this information to transform them into Strike Force Kobra. Kobra sent them to fight the Outsiders and infiltrate Stagg Enterprises. During the resulting fight, Spectrumonster was destroyed and the rest of Strike Force Kobra was defeated by the Outsiders and arrested by the police.\n\nKobra would later form a second incarnation of Strike Force Kobra led by his cult member Lady Eve. When this version of Strike Force Kobra was defeated by Eradicator's incarnation of the Outsiders even after the death of the third Syonide, Lady Eve called Kobra for help only for him to tell them to surrender. This action caused a strain between Kobra and Lady Eve.\n\nStrike Force Kobra I\n\nStrike Force Kobra II\n\nIn \"Kingdom Come\", Jeffrey Burr is a part of the Mankind Liberation Front led by Lex Luthor.\n\nKobra appears in \"Batman '66\" comic continuation of the series.\n\n\nAn alternate version of Kobra appears in \"\" (a companion to \"\"), voiced by Bruce Thomas.\n\nKobra appears in issue #16 of the comic book tie-in to \"Young Justice\". He plotted to perform a ritual on his twin brother Dr. Jason Burr by having Mammoth and Shimmer abduct him. The ritual was crashed by Batman, Flash, Green Arrow, and their protégés. In issue #17, Kobra had to prick his brother's finger in order to step up the ritual despite the interference. After feeding some of Jason's blood to a snake, Kobra drank the Blockbuster formula and some of the blood in order to finish the ritual. Jason was absorbed into the dagger as Kobra gains snake-like abilities. After the mutated Kobra was pricked with the dagger, the mutation was undone and Jason Burr was restored. Unfortunately, Kobra was nowhere to be seen.\n\n"}

Sorce (born September 18, 1958), better known by his stage name Don Geronimo, is a former American radio personality formerly featured on the nationally syndicated radio talk show \"Don and Mike Show\".\n\nGeronimo began his career in radio at the age of 13 when he went to work at Rockville, Maryland AM station WINX (now WLXE, a Spanish-language music station).\nHe continued working at a variety of local stations, being fired at each for lacking the required FCC broadcaster's license, before forging a license. Geronimo landed what was then his dream job at WLS-FM in Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s. He then moved to WBBM-FM (B96) to do the evening show. Eventually, he replaced Dick Biondi doing morning drive at the same station.\n\nGeronimo returned to the Washington, D.C. area in 1985, doing afternoons at WAVA-FM. He moved to mornings in 1986, replacing \"Charlie & Harrigan\". His partnership with Mike O'Meara, co-host of the \"Don and Mike Show\", was forged at WAVA. Their show moved to WJFK-FM in 1991.\n\n\"Washington Post\" radio reporter Marc Fisher features Geronimo in his book \"Something in the Air\", on the rise and fall of radio in the United States. Fisher also conducted an interview with Geronimo prior to his first of three retirements, the first from \"The Don & Mike Show\" in 2008, during which Don spoke out about his frustration with the direction radio has taken following high profile decency events such as the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident.\n\nAfter only two months in retirement, Geronimo announced that he would return to the air on WOCM, a small, independently owned radio station in Ocean City, Maryland. \"Don Geronimo's Rockin' Soul Show\" featured popular music from the '70s and '80s. Geronimo described the show as \"music that doesn't suck\". After one month on the air at WOCM, Geronimo was fired from the station over creative differences. Don subsequently hosted a mid-morning talk show on WGMD (92.7 FM Rehoboth Beach, Delaware) from June 22, 2009 to October 13, 2009, when he retired for his second time, although he did some fill-in work at Classic Hits WCBS-FM in New York a few days in late November and December 2009.\n\nDon Geronimo was named midday host of 1140 The Fan 1140 KHTK (AM), Sacramento effective on Monday, June 21, 2010. The four-hour program was scheduled Monday through Friday, noon to 4 pm local time. On January 27, Geronimo announced that he would be a regular on the TV show \"Good Day Sacramento\", with his first appearance on February 14, 2011. On May 9, 2011, Geronimo announced that his contract with CBS was extended through 2014 and he was named Program Director for 1140 The Fan KHTK. As of July 11, 2011, Geronimo's show moved to the morning drive, 5:30–10 am local time after the \"Rise Guys\" left for a gig in San Francisco. At the same time, Don also ended his in-studio presence on \"Good Day Sacramento\". He now occasionally contributes to GDS remotely via camera. On July 8, 2013, Geronimo's show moved to the midday slot on KHTK and can now be heard from noon to 3:00 pm local time.\n\nAs of Friday October 4, 2013, \"The Don Geronimo Show\" has been replaced by the Jason Ross show on CBS Sports Radio 1140 KHTK. A caller asked what happened, and Jason Ross simply explained, \"CBS Sports Radio decided to go in another direction, which is sports. Don Geronimo is still employed by CBS Sports Radio.\" On October 16, 2013, Don went on the air on KHTK in Sacramento to thank those who supported him during his time in Sacramento. He said he was going to be doing a new project with CBS in the near future and it would be announced via his Twitter feed. On October 23, Don appeared on 106.7 The Fan's \"Lavar and Dukes\" show to announce his return to the station after five years, where he would appear weekdays from 7–10 p.m. local time, Saturdays from 9 a.m.–noon local time, and during Washington Redskins pre/post game shows as well. On March 1, 2014, Geronimo stated that he would no longer be heard on WJFK anymore. He announced on his Twitter feed that \"No one should be shocked I'm not in the plans for CBS/DC. I had opined recently on air how I didn't understand the logic. Now 30 more days.\"\n\nDon has worked at the following stations:\nGeronimo first appeared on air part-time on WINX in Rockville, Maryland in 1971. \n\nIn November and December 2009, Geronimo filled shifts on WCBS-FM in New York City.\n\nDon has appeared in \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\", \"Babylon 5\" and \"The King of Queens\". He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild. He has stated on several occasions on the Don and Mike Show that he and his partner at that time, Mike O'Meara, spoke without authorization during their Babylon 5 taping, which was supposed to have been a non-speaking role for each. Rather than re-shoot the scene, the show's producers arranged for their union memberships. This paved the way for a speaking role on \"The King of Queens\", where he spoke one line, \"Lookin' good, Heffernan!\" He has also co-hosted with Marty Bass post-game coverage of the Baltimore Ravens games for WJZ-TV (Channel 13).\n\nDon married Janet Sorce on March 21, 2009 and has one son (Bart Sorce) and one daughter (Amy) from previous marriages.\n\nDon's first wife, Freda, died on July 10, 2005 in an automobile accident on Maryland Route 90 near Ocean City, Maryland, where the Sorces had their vacation home. Freda was a frequent contributor to the \"Don and Mike Show\" and her spirited interaction with Don was an integral part of the program. Following her death, Don took a from the show until August 1, 2005, when he returned to the air with an emotional solo broadcast.\n\nOn Friday, October 22, 2010, during the Don Geronimo live stage show Don slipped and fell off the stage. Don suffered head trauma and was admitted to a local hospital and later transferred to ICU.\n\nIn 1994, Geronimo and his then radio partner Mike O'Meara were sued for $35 million by an anonymous University of Maryland student who claimed the pair had violated her privacy and inflicted emotional distress.\nIn May 2007, a Leesburg, Virginia man named Carl Grossman, who had once been a frequent caller to the \"Don and Mike Show\", pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of stalking. Geronimo had received a letter from the man which contained threats to Geronimo and his family. The judge also issued a lifetime restraining order in the case.\n\nOn February 4, 2008, Don announced his retirement from his radio show to pursue his personal life for a while. His last appearance on the \"Don and Mike Show\" was Friday, April 11, 2008 with Mike O'Meara to continue the show after that (as the \"Mike O'Meara Show\"). Don was widely expected to return to radio in some form in the future.\n\nAfter only two months in retirement, Geronimo announced that he would return to the air on WOCM, a small, independently owned radio station in Ocean City, Maryland. \"Don Geronimo's Rockin' Soul Show\" aired weekdays from 1 pm – 3pm featuring popular music from the 1970s and 1980s. After four weeks, Geronimo left the station.\n\nIn May 2010, Geronimo announced that beginning June 21, he would be returning to KHTK, a station which formerly syndicated the \"Don and Mike Show\", to host a mid-day show.\n\nAs of Friday October 4, 2013, \"The Don Geronimo Show\" was replaced by the Jason Ross show on CBS Sports Radio 1140 KHTK. Geronimo would return to the airwaves several days later to explain that KHTK decided to go with all sports programming, but that he would return to a CBS Radio station soon.\n\nDon Geronimo returned to WJFK-FM on October 24, 2013. His sports-oriented show aired weekdays from 7–10pm and on Saturdays from 9:00am to noon. Initially, he broadcast the show from a studio at CBS Radio's main building in Sacramento at Commerce Circle, then from a studio at his home in Sacramento when CBS internal politics prevented the show from being done at the company's building. Co-hosts for the show were located at WJFK's studios in Lanham, Maryland. While it was intended that Geronimo would move to the Washington area to do the show live at WJFK's studios, this never materialized after frequent preemptions and schedule changes. Geronimo announced on his Twitter feed on March 1, 2014 that he would no longer be heard on WJFK. His last show had been broadcast on February 26, 2014.\n\nOn April 1, 2014, Geronimo began broadcasting a new show, also entitled \"The Don Geronimo Show\", via podcast on the RELM Network. The show airs live weekdays from 3:00pm until 5:00pm ET. The show is a commercial-free, uncensored, subscription-based podcast that listeners can stream live or download for offline listening after the show airs. The show was announced on Twitter as \"the show I always wanted to do.\"\n\n"}

He was born at Edenham, Lincolnshire. Although his exact date of birth is not recorded, parish records show the date of his baptism as 23 April 1438.\n\nSir William led an uneventful life until the feud between the houses of York and Lancaster broke into open bloodshed. While he always claimed in life \"...to let each man place his feet in the soil as the good lord intended...\"()), he ultimately sided with the Lancastrians.\n\nHe fought in several of the major battles of the Wars of the Roses. He was probably knighted before the Battle of Northampton, where his father was killed. He fought at the Battle of Towton, the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil, but was taken prisoner and attainted along with other prominent Lancastrian lords. Beaumont obtained a general pardon two days before Christmas, but all his lands were declared forfeit and granted to Lord Hastings. This action erected a permanent barrier to any reconciliation with King Edward.\n\nAfter the restoration of Henry VI in November 1470, King Henry revoked the bill of attainder and restored Sir William's lands and titles. However, the following March, he opposed Edward's landing at Ravenspur. He joined forces with the Duke of Exeter, but they were too weak and were forced to stand aside at Newark and allow Edward to march south to London.\n\nBeaumont fought under Oxford at the Battle of Barnet, but suspecting treachery, they fled. With the Yorkist Edward IV on the throne again, Beaumont was once more stripped of his lands and titles.\n\nBetween 1471 and 1474, he was continually at war, holding (amongst other bastions), St Michael's Mount along with John De Vere, Earl of Oxford, for the Lancastrians in 1473. However, misfortune continued to dog Sir William, and in 1474, he was taken prisoner and imprisoned at Hammes. Released by Sir James Blount, he landed at Milford Haven with Henry Tudor and fought against Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485.\n\nSir William's lands and titles were restored (for the second time) by act of Parliament on 7 November 1485.\n\nBy 1487, Beaumont was reported to be incapacitated by mental illness. Parliament ruled that he no longer had \"sadness [seriousness] or discretion to rule and keep\" his estates, and gave Beaumont's former comrade-in-arms John De Vere control of Beaumont's lands during his lifetime. He and his family lived in the care of his friend for his remaining years. The precise nature of Beaumont's mental illness is not known, but two sources suggest that he was not completely incapacitated. He was witness to a bond in 1488, which suggests he was capable of lucidity at that time. In 1498, an inscription written in his name bequeathed a book to his wife.\n\nHe died on 19 December 1507, aged 69, at Oxford's home at Wivenhoe, where he is buried. His widow later married Oxford. The Beaumonts were one of only seven great families who remained irreconcilably anti-Yorkist throughout the Wars of the Roses.\n\nBeaumont married firstly on 6 August 1462, Joan daughter of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham. This marriage was set aside before 1477. He married secondly Elizabeth Scrope, daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Scrope, the second son of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton, by Eleanor, the daughter of Norman Washbourne.\n\nAt least one child was born to his mistress Jayne Stephens circa 1459, by the name of John Francis Beaumont. Whilst Sir William never recognised the child as his heir, he did provide for the child's education and welfare.\n\nUpon the death of Sir William, the Viscountcy of Beaumont became extinct in both England and France and due to discord and fighting between his great nephews, the title fell into abeyance.\n\n"}

Thus each initial kinetic energy corresponds to a depth in the sample where the reaction occurs (the higher the energy, the deeper the reaction).\n\nFor example, a commonly used reaction to profile hydrogen with an energetic N ion beam is\n\nwith a sharp resonance in the reaction cross section at 6.385 MeV of only 1.8 keV . Since the incident N ion loses energy along its trajectory in the material it must have an energy higher than the resonance energy to induce the nuclear reaction with hydrogen nuclei deeper in the target. \n\nThis reaction is usually written H(N,αγ)C. It is \"inelastic\" because the Q-value is not zero (in this case it is 4.965 MeV). Rutherford backscattering (RBS) reactions are elastic (Q = 0), and the interaction (scattering) cross-section σ given by the famous formula derived by Lord Rutherford in 1911. But non-Rutherford cross-sections (so-called \"EBS\", elastic backscattering spectrometry) can also be resonant: for example, the O(α,α)O reaction has a strong and very useful resonance at 3038.1 ± 1.3 keV.\n\nIn the H(N,αγ)C reaction (or indeed the N(p,αγ)C \"inverse reaction\"), the energetic emitted γ ray is characteristic of the reaction and the number that are detected at any incident energy is proportional to the hydrogen concentration at the respective depth in the sample. Due to the narrow peak in the reaction cross section primarily ions of the resonance energy undergo a nuclear reaction. Thus, information on the hydrogen distribution can be straight forward obtained by varying the N incident beam energy.\n\nHydrogen is an element inaccessible to Rutherford backscattering spectrometry since nothing can \"back\"scatter from H (since all atoms are heavier than hydrogen!). But it is often analysed by elastic recoil detection.\n\nNRA can also be used non-resonantly (of course, RBS is non-resonant). For example, deuterium can easily be profiled with a He beam without changing the incident energy by using the\n\nreaction, usually written H(He,p)α. The energy of the fast proton detected depends on the depth of the deuterium atom in the sample.\n\n\n"}

The 13th SS Division was not initially transferred to the corps, being involved in fighting against Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia. In August, due to high rates of desertion from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Heinrich Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.\n\nBy September 1944, the Red Army had advanced to the border of Hungary, which placed the corps training area close to the front lines. \"Kama\" was not ready for combat and was disbanded; its volunteers went to strengthen the \"Handschar\" and the 31st SS Panzergrenadier Division. In mid-September, the corps was strengthened by several combat divisions, including the \"Handschar\" and went into action against Yugoslav partisans.\n\nIn October, the corps was moved to the frontline in Hungary, where it took command of four combat divisions, the 13th Panzer Division, 60th Panzergrenadier Division \"Feldherrnhalle\", 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" and the 22nd SS Cavalry Division \"Maria Theresa\". All these divisions had been involved in the recent heavy fighting around Debrecen. Between them, the divisions barely had 60 tanks.\n\nAs all subordinate units were now Germanic, the corps was redesignated as IX SS Mountain Corps. The renamed corps was ordered to form a part of the 6th Army, defending the approaches to Budapest.\n\nOn 24 November 1944, the corps staff arrived in Budapest, the combat divisions already in action against the advancing Soviet forces. After a month's heavy fighting, the corps was encircled in the city. The corps was placed in command of all encircled German units, and Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch was placed in command. Having spent his career as a police commander, Pfeffer-Wildenbruch lacked even a basic military understanding, and as the 6th Army commander Hermann Balck said \"At best, one could say that Budapest was being led by a politician\". Pfeffer-Wildenbruch established his corps command centre on Castle Hill, in the centre of the Hungarian Government District, and ordered the encircled forces to attempt breakouts, which they were unable to accomplish. A rescue effort was being assembled by Balck's army group.\n\nOn 1 January 1945, the IV SS Panzer Corps launched Operation Konrad I, the first in a series of relief attempts. After initial gains, the assault stalled. Konrad II followed, which reached to within sight of the city before being halted by stubborn Soviet defence.\n\nBy 17 January, the remainder of the corps along with the Hungarian I Corps, commanded by General Iván Hindy, were evacuated across the Danube to Buda. The final relief effort, Konrad III, was halted on 28 January. By this stage, the axis forces in Buda had been pushed into a one square kilometer pocket. On 11 February 1945, the corps was ordered to attempt a breakout. Only 785 troops were able to reach German lines, including 170 Waffen-SS men. On 12 February, the remainder of the corps was destroyed, with small groups of men, including Pfeffer-Wildenbruch and his staff, surrendering to the Soviet forces.\n\n\n16 September 1944 – Croatia\n\n\n26 December 1944 – Budapest\n\n"}
{"id": "2216052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216052", "title": "Malice (law)", "text": "Malice (law)\n\nMalice is a legal term referring to a party's intention to do injury to another party. Malice is either \"expressed\" or \"implied\". Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a human being. Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. Malice, in a legal sense, may be inferred from the evidence and imputed to the defendant, depending on the nature of the case.\n\nIn many kinds of cases, malice must be found to exist in order to convict. (For example, malice is an element of the crime of arson in many jurisdictions.) In civil law cases, a finding of malice allows for the award of greater damages, or for punitive damages. The legal concept of malice is most common in Anglo-American law, and in legal systems derived from the English common law system.\n\nIn English civil law (being the law of England and Wales), relevant case law in negligence and misfeasance in a public office includes \"Dunlop v. Woollahra Municipal Council\" [1982] A.C. 158; \"Bourgoin S.A. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\" [1986] Q.B. 716; \"Jones v Swansea City Council\" [1990] 1 WLR 1453; \"Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of The Bank of England\", [2000] and \"Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis\" [1995] 2 QB 335, in which Steyn LJ. found that malice could be made out if the acts were done with an actual intention to cause injury. Malice could be shown if the acts were done in the knowledge of invalidity or lack of power and with knowledge that it would cause or be likely to cause injury. Malice would also exist if the acts were done with reckless indifference or deliberate blindness to that invalidity or lack of power and that likely injury. These elements, with respect, are consistent with the views of the majority albeit that some of those views were expressed tentatively having regard to the basis upon which the case before them was presented.\n\nIn English criminal law on \"mens rea\" (Latin for \"guilty mind\"), \"R v. Cunningham\" (1957) 2 AER 412 was the pivotal case in establishing both that the test for \"maliciously\" was subjective rather than objective, and that malice was inevitably linked to recklessness. In that case, a man released gas from the mains into adjoining houses while attempting to steal money from the pay-meter:\n\nIn any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken ... as requiring either:\n\nLord Diplock confirmed the relationship to recklessness in \"R v Mowatt\" (1968) 1 QB 421:\n\nIn the offence under section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, the word \"maliciously\" does import upon the part of the person who unlawfully inflicts the wound or other grievous bodily harm an awareness that his act may have the consequence of causing some physical harm to some other person ... It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity described in the section, i.e. a wound or serious physical injury. It is enough that he should have foreseen that some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character, might result.\n\nIn the United States, the malice standard was set in the Supreme Court case of \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\", allowing free reporting of the civil rights movement. The malice standard decides whether press reports about a public figure can be considered defamation or libel.\n\n"}

Scott. Adapted from a story by Jonas McCord, the plot follows Andy and Tracy Safian, a newlywed couple whose lives are upturned after they rent part of their Victorian home to Jed, a cavalier surgeon; things are further complicated when he removes Tracy's ovaries during an emergency surgery to save her life. The film features supporting performances from Bebe Neuwirth, Peter Gallagher, and Tobin Bell, with minor appearances from Gwyneth Paltrow and Brenda Strong.\n\nReleased in the fall of 1993, \"Malice\" grossed a total of $46 million in the United States.\n\nAndy and Tracy Safian are a newlywed couple living in a Victorian house that they are restoring in Western Massachusetts. He is an Associate Dean at a local college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill, a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant.\n\nWhen Paula Bell, one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police detective Dana Harris to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample in order to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort.\n\nAnother doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. Tracy tells Jed she's suing him for malpractice.\n\nJed delivers a deposition in which he launches into a monologue about his own infallibility as a surgeon, concluding with the assertion that he is literally God. Fearful of the negative publicity that would result from a civil trial, the hospital and Jed's insurance company settle with Andy and Tracy for $20 million. However, Tracy leaves Andy, telling him that she can't forgive him for the loss of her ability to have children.\n\nThe serial rapist, a handyman at the college named Earl, is arrested after a struggle with Andy. He had stumbled upon hairs Earl had collected of his victims and kept among his belongings. Andy's name was cleared in the process. In the aftermath of the arrest, Dana informs Andy that his semen sample indicated that he was sterile, and that he couldn't have fathered Tracy's child. Andy confronts Tracy's lawyer, Dennis Riley, accusing him of having impregnated Tracy; Riley protests his innocence, but tells Andy that Tracy's mother — whom she had told Andy had died 12 years ago — can answer all of his questions. Riley refuses to break lawyer-client privilege, but tells Andy to take a bottle of Scotch to her.\n\nAndy tracks down Mrs. Kennsinger, who tells Andy that Tracy is a lifelong con artist. As a younger woman, she had an affair with a wealthy man, who paid for her to have an abortion; Tracy kept the money and had it done at a clinic, beginning her career as a con woman. Andy ultimately learns that Tracy arranged for Jed to move into the house so that he could begin overdosing her with a fertility drug which causes ovarian cysts when taken in excess amounts, revealing the real reason why Tracy left Andy for Jed. An angry Andy confronts Tracy and tells her he wants half of the settlement money. Suspecting that she might try to murder him, Andy implies their next-door neighbor, the ten-year-old boy who's been their seeming voyeur, is named in his will as a potential police witness to her and Jed's nefarious activities.\n\nSupported by Andy's suggestion, Jed tells Tracy to give Andy what he wants so they can leave the country, but Tracy instead suggests murdering the boy. Jed refuses to kill a child, so Tracy shoots him to death, ending their partnership. That night, with the money about to be given to Andy, she slips into the neighbor's house and attempts to suffocate the boy, only to see that the figure she had seen sitting by his bedroom window was in fact a CPR dummy. Tracy destroys the dummy and lunges at Andy, claiming that it was a set-up. Detective Harris appears and arrests her, revealing that the boy's supposed agreement to testify against her was part of a sting operation to catch her in the act of attempted murder.\n\nAs Tracy is led away in handcuffs, the real boy and his mother return home; as she is put into the police car, Tracy sees that the boy is, in fact, blind. Andy leaves with Dana to have a drink of Scotch.\n\n\"Malice\" was shot on location in Boston, Amherst, Holyoke, and Northampton in Massachusetts. Smith College was the setting used for Andy's college.\n\nMichael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert, two of the co-founders of Canadian animation studio Nelvana, worked as executive producers on the film.\n\n\"Malice\" had its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 29, 1993, and opened on 1,431 screens in the U.S. on October 1, 1993 and grossed $9,232,650 during its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office. It eventually earned a total of $46,405,336 in the U.S.\n\n\"Malice\" earned mixed reviews from critics, holding a 59% approval rating on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called the film \"one of the busiest movies I've ever seen, a film jampacked with characters and incidents and blind alleys and red herrings. Offhand, this is the only movie I can recall in which an entire subplot about a serial killer is thrown in simply for atmosphere.\" He added, \"I can't go into detail without revealing vital secrets. Yet after the movie is over and you try to think through those secrets, you get into really deep molasses . . . \"Malice\" was directed by Harold Becker, whose credits include the splendid films \"The Onion Field\" and \"Sea of Love\", and he milks this material for a great deal more than it is worth.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" observed, \"Goaded on by writer Aaron Sorkin, who could run a red-herring factory, the actors work to keep you guessing long after you've caught on. No one shows any shame about going over the top, especially Anne Bancroft in an Oscar-begging cameo as Tracy's mother. Perhaps director Harold Becker thought flashy acting could distract us from the gaping plot holes. Becker gets so intent on confusing us, he forgets to give us characters to care about . . . It's got suspense but no staying power.\"\n\nTimothy M. Gray of \"Variety\" said, \"The immaculately crafted \"Malice\" is a virtual scrapbook of elements borrowed from other suspense pix, but no less enjoyable for being so familiar. [It] should tickle audiences who want to be entertained without being challenged . . . Some of the plotting gets plodding . . . but on the whole, the script does what it set out to do, and if the filmmakers didn't worry about these things, neither should you . . . After listless performances in such pics as \"Days of Thunder\" and \"Far and Away\", Aussie Kidman, who here uses a flawless American accent, proves her strengths as an actress, and Baldwin mixes menace, sex and humor in another terrific performance.\"\n\nIn the \"30 Rock\" episode \"St. Valentine's Day\", Jack Donaghy, portrayed by Baldwin, confesses to a priest that he once said \"I am God\" during a deposition. This is a reference to a famous line by Jed Hill, Baldwin's character in this film.\n\nIn the episode \"Terms of Endearment\" of the animated television series \"Drawn Together\", the character Wooldoor Sockbat recites the closing lines of Baldwin's speech verbatim.\n\n\n"}

The test is performed by placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position, thereafter the clinician performs a lumbar puncture. The opening pressure is measured. Then, the clinician's assistant compresses both jugular veins (if increased intracranial pressure is not suspected then one may exert pressure on both external jugular veins but usually pressure is first exerted on the abdomen, this pressure causes an engorgement of spinal veins and in turn rapidly increases cerebrospinal fluid pressure), which leads to a rise in the intracranial pressure. Given normal anatomy, the intracranial pressure will be reflected as a rapidly rising pressure measured from the lumbar needle, within 10–12 seconds. If there is a stenosis in the spine, there will be a damped, delayed response in the lumbar pressure, thus a positive Queckenstedt's maneuver.

It was established during the term of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to monitor Axis activities in Central and South America.\n\nIn 1934, President Roosevelt began to grow concerned about activities of Nazi groups within the United States. The FBI was ordered to begin investigating these groups operating within the country. The goal of this work was to determine if foreign agents were working within these American Nazi groups.\n\nIn 1940, the government decided to expand the scope of this mission. There were more than 1.5 million expatriate Germans living in South America, including Argentina and Brazil. As a result, this area had become an active area of Axis espionage, propaganda and sabotage. In June 1940, President Roosevelt ordered the formation of the Special Intelligence Service to monitor these activities.\n\nThe SIS allied with the BIS (Basque Intelligence Service) in Latin America.\n\nIt is presumptive that Assistant Director Percy E. \"Sam\" Foxworth was the first chief of the SIS. He died in a plane crash on 15 January 1943 with agent Harold Dennis Haberfeld. The second chief appears to have been Jerome Doyle.\n\nThe front for the organization was actually an operating law firm, called the \"Importers and Exporters Service Company.\" It operated out of room 4332 of the International Building at 30 Rockefeller Center—the RCA Building—beginning in August 1940. The organization took some time to become fully operational, due to language and cultural differences, but within a year the SIS had a number of agents in place under various covers.\n\nThis organization placed more than 340 undercover agents in regions of Latin America. They operated for seven years, and by 1946 a total of 887 Axis spies had been discovered. Also found were 281 agents of Axis propaganda, 222 smugglers shipping important war materials, and more than 100 saboteurs and other operatives. It located 24 secret Axis radio stations and confiscated 40 radio transmitters and 18 receiving sets.\n\nFollowing the war the SIS was disbanded, having been in operation in 1940–1946. After it was disbanded, its region of operation was incorporated into the responsibilities of the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency. Concurrently, the FBI would expand its own primarily domestic counterintelligence role to hunt spies and combat espionage.\n\nThe SIS oversaw the destruction of the Abwehr radio HDZ, which transmitted messages to Nazi receiving stations in Europe. It was instrumental in breaking the code of the German Enigma machine.\n\nAn investigation labeled the \"Jar case\" remains classified.\n\nGerman radio transmitter PQZ was silenced. Guiflermo Hellemann, one of the leader of the spy and sabotage ring was deported to the United States and interrogated.\n\nThe apprehension of a German agent in Colombia led to the identification of German agents in the United States.\n\nThe SIS report:\n\nOn 31 March 1945, Special Agent Jeremiah Cordes Delworth was \"presently serving\" as the FBI Legal Attache in Asuncion, Paraguay. He died in a plane crash on 3 December 1945 near Laguna Ibera, Santo Tome, Corrientes Provence, Argentina. The Argentine Death Certificate gives the names of Gordon Brittain Whelplay and Richard William Scheitzer as witnesses.\n\nThe aircraft of the crash was a U.S. Army C-47, No. 8602. According to Argentine reports, bad weather was the cause. Fourteen were killed in the crash. The flight was from Asuncion to Montevideo, Uruguay. The pilot was Lt.

A geodetic mission collects Geodetic datum.\n\nIt was deemed too difficult to recover the bodies and a gasoline can was parachuted to the search party that located the wrecked plane for the purpose of cremation.\n\nTen sabotage agents were interned in the town of Rubino by the Venezuelan government.\n\nSpecial Agent Robert Howard Calhoun arrived in Venezuela on his first SIS assignment on February 18, 1943. He was assigned as Vice Consul in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, as a cover story. While in Ciudad Bolivar, Agent Calhoun handled investigations involving espionage, sabotage, subversive activity and diamond smuggling.\n\nAfter ten months, he was transferred to Caracas as Assistant Legal Attache. In January, 1944, all cases relating to political and Communist activity were assigned to him. Thomas J. Maleady, Second Secretary of the United States Embassy, was dependent upon Calhoun's reports for his information.\n\nCalhoun developed contacts and confidential informants. Many contacts and confidential informants developed by him in Ciudad Bolivar continued to furnish him with information, although he was not able to contact then personally while in Caracas.\n\nCalhoun led and directed raids against fascists and participated in dangerous assignments.

The Kick.\" \"Get it done, and then some,\" \"Chug & Charge,\" and \"Get to it!\"\n\nVault was a citrus-flavored beverage containing many of the same ingredients as the Coca-Cola beverage Surge. It was discontinued in 2011 in favor of a reintroduced Mello Yello.\n\nTest-marketing occurred in a limited area from June 2005 through Labor Day 2005. During this time, the drink was only available in certain markets in Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia. Vault was released nationally in February 2006 following commercials that were shown during the pregame show for Super Bowl XL.\n\nCoca-Cola representatives and the American Beverage Association stated that Vault contained 47 mg of caffeine per 237 ml (8 fl. oz.) serving, or 70.5 mg per 355 ml (12 fl. oz.) can, and 117.5 mg per 20 fl. oz.

Grape Vault and Peach Vault were two variants available only from Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.\n\nTelevision commercials for Vault featured men performing extraordinary tasks while drinking Vault, in line with the slogan, \"Vault. Get to it!\" One such commercial featured a man building a robotic scarecrow with laser eyes that rids his farm of crows, foxes, rabbits, and hippies. Other commercials included a man converting his and his neighbors' backyards into a football field using explosives and a chainsaw; a man renovating his house into a giant birdcage; a man who blows up a reef bed to obtain a large amount of pearls in order to win his girlfriend back from a Fabioesque man, and a man excelling at paintball, at one point using a squirrel as an improvised weapon. \n\n\"Vault Red Blitz\", a new Vault flavor, was released in late-February 2007 to compete with PepsiCo's Mountain Dew Code Red, along with promotional pricing in select areas. Until its release, Coca-Cola had only released Mello Yello Cherry in limited markets as a competitor to Code Red, which has been available since 2001. Vault Red Blitz is berry-flavored, red, and also features the herbal supplement guarana.\nIn 2006, Vault Zero was reformulated in response to a lawsuit over allegations that ingredients in Fanta Pineapple and Vault Zero had the potential in certain circumstances to combine to form benzene, a carcinogenic compound.\n\n"}

In the 1920s, his father left the \"Corriere della Sera\" and moved to the United States, where he directed the Italian-American newspaper \"Corriere d'America\" from 1923 to 1931.\n\nAfter completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia University, Barzini Jr. worked for two New York newspapers, including the New York World. In 1928, together with Richard Washburn Child, former Ambassador to Italy and a supporter of Benito Mussolini, he ghostwrote \"The Autobiography of Benito Mussolini\". He returned to Italy in 1930 to become a correspondent for \"Corriere della Sera\".\n\nHis father had pro-Fascist sentiments and had access to highest political circles of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Luigi Jr., however, frequently associated with the younger generation of fascists around Galeazzo Ciano, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mussolini's son-in-law.\n\nAs the \"Corriere della Sera \"Asian correspondent, he went to China. On 11 December 1937, he was aboard the USS Panay on the Yangtze Patrol in Nanking at the prompting of George Atcheson, a U.S. Embassy official. Also aboard were Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News' Eric Mayell, the \"New York Times\"'s Norman Soong, \"Collier's Weekly\" correspondent Jim Marshall, and \"La Stampa\" correspondent Sandro Sandri. Atcheson had invited them aboard the Panay so that they could document the fall of the city from relative safety. The four journalists had been covering the ongoing Japanese invasion of China in the mid-1930s, and found themselves in the thick of things in early December 1937 as Japanese forces moved on Nanking.\n\nAccording to Alley, writing in his memoir \"I Witness\", Atcheson proclaimed that aboard the gunboat the group would be \"as safe as you would be on good old American soil.\" Little did any of them know that in just a week's time, the Panay would be attacked and sunk, Sandri killed, and that they would witness the Rape of Nanking.\n\nDuring the attack Barzini, although wounded, performed heroically helping to bring the wounded ashore and providing first aid to the best of his ability. As Sandri, known as \"the Floyd Gibbons of Italy,\" was stretched out in the reeds with excruciatingly painful, fatal stomach wounds, Barzini could only comfort him with an occasional cigarette and a word from time to time. This episode of the incident was captured on Alley's and Mayell's cameras and in a 1937 Wide World Photos shot titled \"Consoling dying Panay victim\".\n\nIn April 1940, he was arrested on charges of leaking confidential information to the enemy and making disparaging remarks about Mussolini. He was confined by the Fascists to forced residence in a village for five years. In 1944, when Rome was liberated, he returned to journalism.\n\nIn 1944 he resumed his journalistic career as the editor-in-chief of daily and weekly publications. He founded \"Il Globo\". Subsequently, he served in turn as the chief editor of several newspapers and magazines.\n\nA staunch anti-Communist, he was a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies from 1958 to 1972, for the centre-right Italian Liberal Party (\"Partito Liberale Italiano\" – PLI).\n\nHe was the father of five children, and lived on a small farm near Rome, where he produced his own olive oil, wine, vegetables, and fruit. Barzini died in 1984 of cancer at his home in Rome. His daughter Benedetta, by his first wife Giannalisa Feltrinelli, was a successful fashion model during the 1960s. His marriage to Feltrinelli also made him the stepfather of Italian publisher and left-wing political activist Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, of whom Barzini eventually disapproved, saying that he thought Giangiacomo preferred the company of men who \"despised the masses as he did, who thought them something they could play with.\" Barzini also rejected as implausible conspiracy theories concerning Giangiacomo's death.\n\n\n"}

He is the husband of the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel. He is one of the seven members of the board of trustees of the Friede Springer Foundation, together with former German president Horst Köhler and others.\n\nJoachim Sauer was born in Hosena, a small town in the marshy Lusatian countryside between Dresden and Cottbus. He grew up with his twin sister and an elder brother. His father, Richard Sauer, had trained as a baker (\"Konditor\"), but worked as an insurance representative. Sauer excelled at school and it quickly became clear that he had both the ability and the ambition to achieve more than this in his own life.\n\nSauer studied chemistry from 1967 to 1972 at the Humboldt University of Berlin and was awarded a doctorate in chemistry in 1974. He continued to do research there until 1977, when he joined the Academy of Sciences, Central Institute of Physical Chemistry in Berlin, one of the leading scientific institutes of the former GDR (East Germany).\n\nFor a brief time during and after the German reunification (1990–1991) he was the deputy technical director (catalysis and sorption) for BIOSYM Technologies, San Diego/USA (now BIOVIA). He remained an advisor for BIOSYM until 2002.\n\nIn 1992, he joined the Max Planck Society as head of the Quantum Chemistry Group in Berlin. In 1993, he became full professor of physical and theoretical chemistry at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He retired from his chair in October 2017 and was succeeded by Martin Schütz, who died the following year. Sauer remains affiliated with the university as a senior research fellow.\n\nHe is an active research scientist in quantum chemistry and computational chemistry. His computational studies have allowed for a better understanding of the structures and activities of some catalysts such as zeolites, specifically their acid sites, as well as the interpretation of solid state NMR spectra of nucleus Si-29, and quadrupolar nuclei such as Na-23, Al-27 and O-17. \n\n\nFrom his previous marriage to a fellow chemist, Sauer has two sons, Daniel and Adrian. On 30 December 1998, he married Angela Merkel (herself a doctor of physics who had once worked in quantum chemistry research), who later became chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union and on 22 November 2005, the first female Chancellor of Germany.\nBecause of his wife's political career, Sauer has received far more media attention than is usual for a research scientist. On several occasions he has stated that he is not fond of this publicity.\n\nDuring the 2005 election campaign Joachim Sauer kept a very low profile, declining to give any interviews not related to his scientific work. He attended the Bayreuth Festival, an opera festival and a highly visible social event in Germany, with his wife.

It is owned and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, and it was opened to the public in March 2014. The facility was one of the permanent venues for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nLee Valley VeloPark is at the northern end of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. It has a velodrome and BMX racing track, which have been used for the Games, as well as a one-mile (1.6 km) road course and 5 miles (8 km) of mountain bike trails. The park replaces the Eastway Cycle Circuit demolished to make way for it. The facilities built for the Olympics were constructed between 2009 and 2011. The first event in the Velopark was the London round of the 2011 UCI BMX Supercross World Cup series.\n\nIn February 2005 plans were announced for a £22 million VeloPark. Sport England would invest £10.5 million, Lee Valley Regional Park Authority £6 million and the Mayor of London and Transport for London would invest £3 million and £2.5 million respectively. The site was to be 34 hectares on the northern end of the proposed Olympic Park, next to the A12. The park would include a velodrome seating 1,500, which could be increased to 6,000 if London's bid for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were successful. The site would also have an international competition BMX circuit, a BMX freestyle park, cyclo-cross/cross-country course mountain bike course and an outdoor cycle speedway track. The facilities would be used by internationals as well as those learning to ride. It was estimated that the park would attract 88,000 users a year, replacing the Eastway Cycle Circuit. Eastway Cycle Circuit opened in 1975, it was the first purpose built road cycling venue in Britain.\n\nThe facility closed in September 2006 to make way for London's VeloPark. The velodrome is the third covered track in Great Britain. In September 2008 plans for the VeloPark were revealed, which were chosen with help from Chris Hoy. However, by March 2007, the VeloPark was revealed to be only a third of its original size, rescaled from 34 to 10 hectares. The decrease in the size of the site led to users of the Eastway cycle circuit to protest to the Mayor of London.\n\nOn 12 July 2007, the Olympic Delivery Authority selected the design team: Hopkins Architects, Expedition Engineering, BDSP, and Grant Associates, following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions.\n\nThe Velopark was scheduled to be completed by the contractor, ISG, in 2011. In 2004, during London's Olympic and Paralympic bid, the estimated cost was £37 million, including £20 million for the velodrome.\n\nIn 2009, at the time work began on the construction of the velodrome, the estimated cost of that facility alone was £105 million. Work on the velodrome was completed in February 2011, and was the first Olympic Park venue to be completed. The roof is designed to reflect the geometry of cycling as well as being lightweight and efficient reflecting a bike. There is also a 360-degree concourse level with windows allowing people views of the Olympic Park. The velodrome is energy efficient—rooflights reduce the need for artificial lights, and natural ventilation reduces the need for air condition. Rain water is also collected, which reduces the amount of water used from the municipal water system. Designer Ron Webb, who designed the velodrome tracks for the Sydney and Athens Games, was in charge of the design and installation of the track. The 250-metre track was made with of Siberian Pine and 350,000 nails.\n\nThe velodrome was officially opened by many successful British athletes including Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton. It is informally known as \"The Pringle\" due to its distinctive shape. It was shortlisted for the 2011 RIBA Stirling Prize. and won the 2011 Structural Awards Supreme Award for Structural Engineering. In 2011, it also won the Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award at British Construction Industry Awards.\n\nThe venue was used for the first time in competition during the UCI Track Cycling World Cup in February 2012. The velodrome was also used for the 2012 Paralympics.\n\nThe outdoor BMX racing track was scheduled to have a spectator capacity of 6,000. Work began on its construction in March 2011. After the games the seating was removed and the track reconfigured to accommodate all abilities. The first competition on the venue was the test event for the Olympic Games, a round of the 2011 UCI Supercross BMX World Cup series. The track for men is 470 metres long and features a berm jump, an S-bend transfer, a box jump and a rhythm section in the final straight. The women's course is 430 metres long featuring three jumps in the opening straight and a tunnel before like the men's including a rhythm section in the final straight. It has been called one of the most challenging BMX tracks to date. The track also features an 8-metre high starting ramp and was designed by the UCI with the aim of pushing the boundaries of the sport. of soil was used to build the track. After the Supercross world cup event, Shanaze Reade called for changes to the track. She stated that the track was on the limit if the wind changed. Sarah Walker echoed Reade's calls stating that the track could get ugly on a windy day.\n\nIn preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, in 2010 the Dutch National Olympic Committee commissioned a replica of the planned BMX track at their National Sports Centre Papendal. It came into use in March 2011, ahead of the hand over of the London Velopark BMX venue.\n\nThe venue was used for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic track cycling competition was held in the Velodrome with the adjoining BMX track hosting the Olympic BMX competition. Team GB dominated the track cycling competition winning seven out of a possible ten gold medals plus one silver and one bronze. The GB Paralympic track cycling team won a total of 15 medals, comprising five golds, seven silver and three bronze.\n\nThe Eastway Cycle Circuit was demolished for the VeloPark before being merged with the new park. It was announced that along with the VeloPark there would be three new cycle circuits created around London. In early February 2007 the plans for the VeloPark were revised with no mountain bike course. By mid-February it was announced that Hog Hill would be the temporary relocation of the Eastway Cycle Centre.\nThe promised cycle speedway track will not be built. In August 2011 it was announced that the road race course will be rerouted to allow more space and parkland after suggestions from Sport England and British Cycling. The course will now cross the River Lee and parkland linking up with other cycle routes in London.\n\nBritish Cycling will remain based at the Olympic-standard Manchester Velodrome which has been a catalyst for the success of British Cycling in recent years, most notably at the 2008 Olympic Games. Team manager of British Cycling, David Brailsford has stated that the new indoor National BMX Arena in Manchester and the undulating terrain of North West England, ideal for practising road race cycling, offer a distinct advantage over London. An agreement was struck in 2012 to bring track cycling to the London Velodrome post-2012 Olympics, with events such as Revolution series which have proved popular in Manchester. In September 2013 the UCI announced that the Velodrome will host the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships.\n\nThe London Development Agency (LDA) have funded a new permanent road cycle circuit and mountain bike course at the Redbridge Cycling Centre, costing £5m. The London Borough of Redbridge will be funding the facility up to the completion of the legacy London Velopark. Work is underway to identify an operator of Hog Hill beyond 2012.\n\nSince opening for the public in March 2014, Lee Valley VeloPark has staged a number of major international events.\nThe first that took place in the venue was the grand finale of the Revolution series in February 2014. This was followed by the opening round of the 2014–15 Revolution Series in October 2014 and in December 2014, the UCI Track Cycling World Cup took place at Lee Valley VeloPark. In February 2015, round five of the Revolution Series was staged at the venue while in February 2016, it hosted the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships.\n\nOn 7 June 2015 Sir Bradley Wiggins broke the UCI Hour record at the Velodrome, setting a distance of .\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by Vincent Tilsley and directed by Don Chaffey and fifth to be produced. It was the second episode to be broadcast in the UK on ITV (ATV Midlands and Grampian) on Friday 6 October 1967 and first aired in the United States on CBS on Saturday 8 June 1968.\n\nThe episode starred Patrick McGoohan as Number Six and introduced Leo McKern as \"Number Two\". McKern's Number Two would return for the last two episodes of the series.\n\nThe episode opens with the relentlessly cheerful voice of the radio announcer encouraging every Villager to participate in an upcoming crafts show. Number Six is playing chess near the beach when Number Two (Leo McKern) joins him. During their conversation, a helicopter lands and an unconscious woman (Nadia Gray) is taken out on a stretcher.\n\nLater, Number Six is invited to The Green Dome where he and Number Two watch the woman wake up on the main viewing screen. Number Two says that she is the new Number Eight and that she will be Number Six's new neighbour.\n\nWhen Number Six returns to his cottage, Number Eight emerges, confused, and asks for directions to The Green Dome. When she returns later, she reveals to him that her name is Nadia, but she is suspicious that he is a Village spy. The day after, Nadia tries to escape by swimming out to sea but is brought back by Rover and interrogated in the hospital. In response, Number Six makes a deal, agreeing to participate more in Village life — for instance, by entering the craft show — if this puts an end to her torture.\n\nNumber Six and Nadia become closer and eventually plan to escape. She tells him that she knows the location of The Village: On the Baltic coast of Lithuania about from the Polish border.\n\nAt the craft show (where every entry except Number Six's is a depiction of Number Two in some medium), Number Six presents his work, a multi-piece abstract sculpture called \"Escape\". He is then awarded first prize and uses the \"work units\" he has won to purchase a tapestry, the entry of one of the other prize winners. At night, he and Nadia escape in his exhibit, which is really a carved boat, using the tapestry as a sail.\n\nWhen they reach land, they meet Nadia's contact. Number Six borrows the contact's watch since his own has stopped. Number Six and Nadia then hide in a packing case as they travel to London. They end up in Number Six's old office and meet his former bosses. When they suspect him of being a double agent, Number Six agrees to tell them why he resigned if Nadia is given protection.\n\nHowever, as he is about to talk, Number Six hears the familiar chimes of Big Ben. He looks at his watch and finds that it shows the same time — not the one hour's difference of the time in Poland. Realising that he has been tricked, he begins a search of the office and discovers a tape recorder recreating the background sounds of London. He exits the building, finding himself back in The Village, with Nadia standing with Number Two — thus revealing she was an operative all along.\n\nDuring the production of the last four episodes of \"The Prisoner\" series (the episode \"Living in Harmony\" was being made) ITC arranged for a press conference to take place at MGM-British studios in Borehamwood on 20 September 1967 - a week before the scheduled broadcast on some British TV channels. At the press coverage Patrick McGoohan (at the start wearing his \"kosho\" uniform, a made up martial art used in the series) was interviewed inside the cage shown in the episode \"Once Upon a Time\". Also present was Angelo Muscat, the mute butler seen in many episodes and Alexis Kanner. Two episodes - \"Arrival\" and \"The Chimes of Big Ben\" - were shown to the press. The alternate version of \"The Chimes of Big Ben\" includes a sequence that was later cut where Number Six uses a triquetrum (an ancient Greek measuring device) to locate the general position of the Village. The end titles also finished with the smaller wheel of the penny farthing resolving into the Earth while a galaxy of stars fills the bigger wheel and then the canopy on the bicycle. The Earth then expanded to a single word 'POP'.\n\nThe broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK. The episode was first shown at 7:30pm on Friday 6 October 1967 on ATV Midlands and Grampian Television, on Sunday 8 October on ATV London, Southern Television, Westward Television and Tyne-Tees; on Thursday 12 October on Scottish Television, on Friday 13 October on Anglia Television, on Thursday 26 October on Border Television and on Friday 3 November on Granada Television in the North West. The aggregate viewing figures for the ITV regions that debuted the season in 1967 have been estimated at 10.1 million. In Northern Ireland, the episode did not debut until Saturday 13 January 1968, and in Wales, the episode was not broadcast until Wednesday 14 January 1970.\n\n"}

The highway connects Port Colborne near Lake Erie with Highway 406 in Welland, via the Main Street Tunnel. It was constructed in the early 1970s as part of the \"Welland Bypass\" project of the Welland Canal, which resulted in the severance of several highways and rail lines. Opened to traffic in late 1972, several months following the tunnel, Highway 140 has remained unchanged since, despite growing calls to resign it as an extension of Highway 406.\n\nHighway 140 begins at an intersection with Highway 3 on the eastern edge of Port Colborne. From there, Highway 3 continues east to Fort Erie; to the west it becomes Niagara Regional Road 3.\nThe roadway carrying Highway 140 continues south of Highway 3 as a local road named Elizabeth Street, whereas Highway 140 travels north, to the west of forestland and a quarry. The highway parallels the Welland Canal throughout its length, always within of the waterway.\nWooden high-tension powerlines parallel the highway until it diverges, curving towards the northeast immediately north of Chippawa Road. It travels diagonally for several kilometres before ascending on an overpass and crossing the former Canadian National Humberstone Subdivision tracks.\n\nThe highway gradually straightens to a north–south alignment as it crosses Highway 58A and a set of railway tracks, both of which travel beneath the nearby Welland Canal to the west. Continuing north, Highway 140 passes over Lyons Creek, which meanders northeast to converge with the Welland River west of the Niagara River. The highway ends approximately north of this point at an intersection with Main Street (Niagara Regional Road 27). Main Street travels beneath the Welland Canal immediately west of Highway 140, providing a connection to Highway 406 on the opposite side.\nBecause of its importance as both a through route past the canal and in linking Highway 140 with Highway 406, East Main Street between Highways 140 and 406 is maintained the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) as Highway 7146.\n\nThe history of Highway 140 begins in May 1966, when the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority received Federal approval for the \"Welland Bypass\", a channel that would serve to bypass the canal through downtown Welland, where several crossings proved to be a hazard for shipping traffic and the shipping traffic an impediment to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The new channel would be dug out and flooded,\nproviding the opportunity for the construction of cheap cut and cover tunnels beneath the channel. By 1968, construction was underway on tunnels at East Main Street and at the Port Colborne – Welland townline.\n\nDue to the numerous road disconnections that would take place as a result of the Welland Bypass, a new highway was proposed to link Welland with Port Colborne.\nOne of the severed highways was Highway 58, which then followed Canal Bank Street south from Welland.\nIn late 1970, the Department of Highways tendered contracts for the construction of the new highway on the east side of the bypass.\nConstruction began from the north, reaching as far south as Ramey Road.\n\nThe section north of Townline Road was completed within a year. Around the same time, the third and final contract was tendered for the section north of Highway 3. On May 20, 1972, the Main Street Tunnel was opened to traffic at a morning ceremony featuring local officials and the Welland Police Association Pipe Band.\nHighway 140 was opened several months later, without ceremony, on October 5.\nIt has remained unchanged since then, and was not affected by the provincial highway transfers in 1997 and 1998.\n\nThe various municipalities serviced by Highway 140, as well as Niagara Region, have called for four-laning the route and redesignating it as Highway 406. However, the MTO is committed to extending Highway 406 to Highway 58 southwest of Welland. On April 4, 2006, the MPP for Erie—Lincoln, Tim Hudak, introduced a Private Member's Bill.\nThe Highway 406 to Port Colborne Act passed first reading, but was not brought up for a second reading.\n\n"}

{"id": "2216235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216235", "title": "The Bible and homosexuality", "text": "The Bible and homosexuality\n\nSeveral passages in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament have been interpreted as involving same-sex sexual acts and desires.\n\nChapters 18 and 20 of Leviticus form part of the Holiness code and list prohibited forms of intercourse, including the following verses:\n\n\nThese two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general. More recent interpretations focus more on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the polytheistic Canaanites. One of those interpretations is from Janet Edmonds, which says:\"To interpret these passages of Leviticus, it’s important to know that this book of the Bible focuses on ritual purity for the Israelites, and setting guidelines for the Israelites to distinguish themselves from their pagan neighbors, the Egyptians and Canaanites, who lived in the lands before they were settled by the Jews. This is shown in Leviticus Chapters 18 and 20 by three specific scripture passages (Leviticus 18:2-3, 18:24 and 20:23) that state that the Israelites should never do what the Egyptians and Canaanites did.\"Bible scholar Idan Dershowitz concludes \"there is good evidence that an earlier version of the laws in Leviticus 18 \"permitted\" sex between men.\"\n\nDaniel A. Helminiak, a Christian author and theologian says \"the anti-gay 'unnatural' hullabaloo rests on a mistranslation\" and that \"nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality\".\n\nThe story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Some interpreters find the story of Sodom and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests more than homosexuality, but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape, or have sex with, the angels who retrieved Lot.\n\nWhile the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom, the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent among Christian communities that the name \"Sodom\" became the basis of the word \"sodomy\", still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex.\n\nWhile the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom, Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice as well as its commission of 'abomination':\nThe Talmudic tradition as written between c. 370 and 500 also interprets the sin of Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being a manifestation of the city's violation of the social order of hospitality; as does Jesus in the New Testament, for instance in Matthew 10:14–15 when he tells his disciples that the punishment for houses or towns that will not welcome them will be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\nLater traditions on Sodom's sin, such as \"Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\", considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse. In Jude 1:7 the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah are stated to have been \"giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh\", which may refer to homosexuality or to the lust of mortals after angels. Jewish writers Philo (d. AD 50) and Josephus (37 – c. 100) were the first to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom. By the end of the 1st century Jews commonly identified the sin of Sodom with homosexual practices.\n\nThe account of the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Books of Samuel has been interpreted by traditional and mainstream writers as a relationship of affectionate regard. It has also been interpreted by some authors as of a sexual nature. Theologian Theodore Jennings identifies the story as one of desire for David by both Saul and Jonathan, stating, \"Saul's jealousy has driven [David] into Jonathan's arms.\" Michael Coogan addresses the claim of their homosexual relationship and explicitly rejects it.\n\nOne relevant Bible passage on this issue is 1 Samuel 18:1:\nAnother relevant passage is 2 Samuel 1:26, where David says:\n\nThe story of Ruth and Naomi in the Book of Ruth is also occasionally interpreted by contemporary scholars as the story of a lesbian couple. Coogan states that the Hebrew Bible does not even mention lesbianism.\n\nThis passage, part of a larger discourse in 1:18-32, has been debated by some 20th and 21st-century interpreters as to its relevance today and as to what it actually prohibits and whether it represents Paul's view or rhetoric that Paul is actively arguing against. Although Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity, some 20th and 21st-century authors contend the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts, suggesting, among other interpretations, that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experimented with homosexual activity or that Paul's condemnation was relative to his own culture, in which homosexuality was not understood as an orientation and in which being penetrated was seen as shameful. These interpretations are in a minority. \nScholars, noting that Romans 1:18-32 represents an exception in the book of Romans as a whole and uses vocabulary elsewhere not seen in Paul's letters, have for decades puzzled over the passage. Several scholars believe these verses are part of a much larger non-Pauline interpolation, a later addition to the letter. Others argue that the grammar of the Greek original demands that Romans 1:18-32 be read as a rhetorical set up, a summary of Hellenistic Jewish legalist rhetoric that Paul actively forbids followers of Christ from using in Romans 2.\n\nIn the context of the broader immorality of his audience, Paul the Apostle wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 6 verses 9-11,\n\nThe word translated as \"sodomites\" also appears in 1 Timothy 1:8-11:\n\nIn the letter to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: Malakia () and arsenokoitai (). \n\nArsenokoitai (translated 'sodomites' in above translation) is a compound word from the Greek words 'arrhēn / arsēn' () meaning \"male\", and koitēn () meaning \"bed\", with a sexual connotation. Its first recorded use was by Paul in 1 Corinthians (and later in 1 Timothy 1, attributed to Paul) although many scholars consider it to be adapted from the wording of the Septuagint translations of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:23\" Arsenokoitai has been variously rendered as \"sodomites\" (NRSV), \"abusers of themselves with mankind\" (KJV), \"men who have sex with men\" (NIV) or \"practicing homosexuals\" (NET)\n\nMalakoi (translated 'male prostitutes' in above translation) is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, \"soft\" (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to describe a garment); of things not subject to touch, \"gentle\"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include \"pathic\". \n\nBishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a \"soft\" or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or \"those who abuse themselves\"; all that is factually known about the word is that it means \"soft\".\n\nMost scholars hold that Paul had two passages of the Book of Leviticus, and , in mind when he used the word ἀρσενοκοῖται (which may be of his coinage) with most commentators and translators interpreting it as a reference to male same-sex intercourse. However, John Boswell states that it \"did not connote homosexuality to Paul or his early readers\", and that in later Christian literature the word is used, for instance, by Aristides of Athens (c. 138) clearly not for homosexuality and possibly for prostitution, Eusebius (d. c. 340) who evidently used it in reference to women, and in the writings of 6th-century Patriarch John IV of Constantinople, known as John the Faster. In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of \"arsenokoitia\" as active or passive and says that \"many men even commit the sin of \"arsenokoitia\" with their wives\". Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity. Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F. Greenberg, who declares usage of the term \"arsenokoites\" by writers such as Aristides of Athens and Eusebius, and in the Sibylline Oracles, to be \"consistent with a homosexual meaning\". A discussion document issued by the House of Bishops of the Church of England states that most scholars still hold that the word \"arsenokoites\" relates to homosexuality. Another work attributed to John the Faster, a series of canons that for various sins provided shorter though stricter penances in place of the previous longer penances, applies a penance of eighty days for \"intercourse of men with one another\" (canon 9), explained in the \"Pedalion\" as mutual masturbation – double the penalty for solitary masturbation (canon 8) – and three years with xerophagy or, in accordance with the older canon of Basil the Great, fifteen without (canon 18) for being \"so mad as to copulate with another man\" – ἀρρενομανήσαντα in the original – explained in the \"Pedalion\" as \"guilty of arsenocoetia (i.e., sexual intercourse between males)\" – ἀρσενοκοίτην in the original. According to the same work, ordination is not to be conferred on someone who as a boy has been the victim of anal intercourse, but this is not the case if the semen was ejaculated between his thighs (canon 19). These canons are included, with commentary, in the \"Pedalion\", the most widely used collection of canons of the Greek Orthodox Church, an English translation of which was produced by Denver Cummings and published by the Orthodox Christian Educational Society in 1957 under the title, \"The Rudder\".\n\nSome scholars consider that the term was not used to refer to a homosexual orientation, but argue that it referred instead to sexual activity.\n\nOther scholars have interpreted \"arsenokoitai\" and \"malakoi\" (another word that appears in ) as referring to weakness and effeminacy or to the practice of exploitative pederasty.\n\nIn Matthew 19 (and parallel in Mark 10), Jesus is asked if a man can divorce his wife. In that context, Jesus replies:,\nRobert Gagnon, a theologian, argues that Jesus's back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\".\n\nOn the other hand, Bart Ehrman, Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, states of Jesus's references to Genesis 1 and 2, \"Yeah, [Jesus is] not actually defining marriage. He’s answering a specific question.\" Ehrman notes further \"And here the conversation is quite easy. In our surviving records Jesus says nothing about same-sex acts or sexual orientation. Nothing.  Nada.\"\n\nIn Matthew 8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. Daniel A. Helminiak writes that the Greek word \"pais\", used in this account, was sometimes given a sexual meaning. Donald Wold states that its normal meaning is \"boy\", \"child\" or \"slave\" and its application to a boy lover escapes notice in the standard lexica of Liddell and Scott and Bauer. The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott registers three meanings of the word παῖς (\"pais\"): a child in relation to descent (son or daughter); a child in relation to age (boy or girl); a slave or servant (male or female). In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word \"pais\" indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave.\n\nMatthew's account has parallels in Luke 7:1–10 and John 4:46–53. There are major differences between John's account and those of the two synoptic writers, but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts, with next to nothing of the details in Luke 7:2–6 being present also in Matthew. The Commentary of Craig A. Evans states that the word \"pais\" used by Matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as Q used by both Matthew and Luke and, since it can mean either son or slave, it became \"doulos\" (slave) in Luke and \"huios\" (son) in John. Writers who admit John 4:46–53 as a parallel passage generally interpret Matthew's \"pais\" as \"child\" or \"boy\", while those who exclude it see it as meaning \"servant\" or \"slave\".\n\nTheodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the \"pais\" in Matthew's account is the centurion's \"boy-love\" and that the centurion did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. D.B. Saddington writes that while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports \"neither of these interpretations\", with Wendy Cotter saying that they fail to take account of Jewish condemnation of pederasty.\n\nIn Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks of eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven. Jesus's reference to eunuchs who were born as such has been interpreted by some commentators as having to do with homosexual orientation; Clement of Alexandria, for instance, cites in his book \"Stromata\" (chapter III,1,1) an earlier interpretation from Basilides that some men, from birth, are naturally averse to women and should not marry. \"The first category – those eunuchs who have been so from birth – is the closest description we have in the Bible of what we understand today as homosexual.\"\n\nThe Ethiopian eunuch, an early gentile convert described in Acts 8, has been interpreted by some commentators as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word \"eunuch\" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12. Some religious commentators suggest that the combination of \"eunuch\" together with the title \"court official\" indicates a literal eunuch who would have been excluded from the Temple by the restriction in Deuteronomy 23:1.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his win in the 1990 Daytona 500. He last competed part-time in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 99 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for StarCom Racing. Cope also serves as team manager.\n\nCope was born in San Diego, California and was raised in Spanaway, Washington. In high school, he enjoyed auto racing and baseball. He was a catcher on the Bethel High School baseball team, and later played college baseball at Whitman College. While being scouted by major league baseball teams, Cope suffered a knee injury that ended his playing career. He then devoted himself to racing full-time.\n\nCope progressed through the short-track ranks in the Northwest, and later made his Winston Cup Series debut at Riverside International Raceway in 1982. Cope's No. 95 car finished 36th there after developing an oil leak, and he won $625.\n\nHe ran part-time in the Winston Cup Series after that, making an attempt at Rookie of the Year in 1987. In 1989, he signed with Bob Whitcomb to drive the No. 10 Purolator Pontiac and later Chevrolet, posting four top-10 finishes.\n\nDuring the last lap of the 1990 Daytona 500, Dale Earnhardt ran over a piece of debris and cut a tire in turn three. After narrowly avoiding most of the resulting debris, Cope assumed the lead and earned his first win, as well as his first Top 5 (his best finish prior to the 1990 Daytona 500 was sixth) in NASCAR competition. He became an overnight sensation as a result of the win, appearing on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" that week. At Dover later in the 1990 season, Cope rallied for another win after running out of fuel and falling off the lead lap. At year's end, he wound up 18th in points.\n\nFollowing the 1992 season, the Whitcomb team closed down, and Cope drove an originally unsponsored No. 66 Ford for Cale Yarborough. The car was later sponsored by Bojangles, and the number changed to No. 98, reflecting the restaurant's 98 cent value menu.\n\nMidway through the 1994 season, Cope was replaced by Jeremy Mayfield and began driving for Bobby Allison's No. 12 Straight Arrow-sponsored Ford, after a brief stint with car owner T.W. Taylor. During this season, Cope won his first career Busch Series race at New Hampshire International Speedway, driving the No. 82 Ford Thunderbird for Ron Zock. The 1995 season was Cope's most consistent. He had eight Top 10 finishes, and garnered a 15th-place finish in points.\n\nWhen Allison's team shut down after the 1996 season, Cope signed on with the fledgling MB2 Motorsports operation, driving the No. 36 Skittles-sponsored Pontiac to a 27th-place finish in points. After one year, he was released and signed on with the Bahari Racing operation. Despite missing some races due to an injury, Cope won his first career pole position at Lowe's Motor Speedway, although he failed to post a Top 10 finish in the No. 30 Gumout-sponsored car.\n\nCope returned to Bahari in 1999 with Sara Lee sponsorship. After failing to qualify for 10 races, Cope was released from the team. He made sporadic appearances for LJ Racing and Larry Hedrick Motorsports, and later signed on to drive the No. 15 Ford Taurus owned by Fenley-Moore Motorsports. Cope became unhappy when the team only ran a part-time schedule, and quit after a few races. He spent the rest of the year on the sidelines, before taking over the No. 86 R.C. Cola-sponsored Dodge Ram at Impact Motorsports at the end of the season in the Craftsman Truck Series.\n\nIn 2001, Cope announced the formation of Quest Motor Racing, a team he would co-own with drag racer Warren Johnson. The team did not qualify for a race all year, and his only start came with CLR Racing. He ran four races in the Busch Series in the No. 94 owned by Fred Bickford, posting a best finish of 21st at Bristol Motor Speedway. The team had mild success the next year, garnering sponsorship from Avacor and Poison. Cope also ran some races with BAM Racing that year.\n\nAfter 18 starts in 2003 driving the No. 37 Friendly's Ice Cream-sponsored Chevrolet, Cope merged the team with Arnold Motorsports. Cope qualified fifth for the 2004 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, but after several starts, Cope was released from the ride, and took back his equipment. He also ran 30 races in the No. 49 Advil-sponsored Ford for Jay Robinson in the Busch Series that season. His best finish, 20th, came at Daytona.\n\nIn 2005, Cope tried merging his team again, joining forces with Larry Hollenbeck and S.W.A.T. Fitness, but lost the opportunity after he failed to qualify for the Daytona 500. Cope had attempted a couple of races with Ware Racing Enterprises before making his only Cup start of the season at Martinsville Speedway, finishing 33rd in the No. 08 Royal Administration/Sundance Vacations/My Guardian 911-sponsored Dodge for McGlynn Racing. Cope was later given the team's full-time ride in the No. 00, as requested by the sponsor.\n\nIn 2006, Cope intended to run a full schedule for McGlynn with No. 74 car, but soon cut back to part-time. His best finish was at Michigan International Speedway, where he finished 34th. In the Busch Series, his best finish in the 49 car was 33rd at Dover International Speedway, and his best start was 33rd at Bristol Motor Speedway. He intended to run more races with McGlynn in 2007, but the team suspended operations after only attempting one race. He spent the season driving part-time schedules for Robinson and Xpress Motorsports.\n\nIn 2008, he signed to drive for Means Racing in the Nationwide Series, but switched midseason to drive for James Finch and Jay Robinson Racing. Later in the season, Cope began entering his own trucks and cars in the Craftsman Truck Series and Nationwide Series. In the truck series he fielded the No. 73 and No. 74 trucks with Nick Tucker and Jennifer Jo Cobb being the primary drivers, while in the Nationwide Series he fielded the No. 73 and No. 78 cars with Kevin Lepage driving the No. 73 and others racing the No. 78.\n\nAs the 2009 season approached, Cope announced he would be involved on all three of NASCAR's circuits, as he would pilot the No. 75 Cope/Keller Racing Dodge in the Sprint Cup series with BluFrog Energy Drink coming on board as a primary sponsor during Daytona Speedweeks. He began the season as the driver of the No. 41 Metal Jeans Chevrolet Impala for Rick Ware Racing in the Nationwide Series, but was released after three races, and moved to his own team. He has also fielded trucks part-time for himself, Larry Foyt, and Jennifer Jo Cobb. Cope has fielded the No. 78 car for one race in nationwide. He has fielded the No. 73 for most of the races.\n\nIn 2009, Cope attempted six races with his self-owned team; he failed to qualify for any of them. At the October Martinsville race, Cope successfully attempted his first Sprint Cup race since 2006 while driving for Larry Gunselman.\n\nIn 2010, Cope teamed up with Dale Clemons as co-owners of new racing venture Stratus Racing Group. The team ran a full schedule with Cope as driver in both the Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series. It also ran a limited schedule in the ARCA Re/Max Series, fielding a car for Cope's twin nieces Amber Cope and Angela Cope, who split the ride.\n\nCope returned to Jay Robinson Inc. for 2011 in the No. 28 Chevrolet. For the 2011 Daytona 500, Cope attempted to qualify the No. 64 Toyota for Larry Gunselman with sponsorship from Sta-Bil. Cope finished 13th in the Budweiser Shootout driving for Gunselman. Cope has decided to field his cup car in select races with manufacturing backing from Chevrolet instead of Dodge. In the 2011 Sprint Showdown, Cope was involved in a crash with Landon Cassill, where he T-boned Cassill's car when he spun out. Neither driver was injured. Cope finished 20th in Nationwide Series standings, competing in all but one event.\n\nCope returned to the Nationwide Series in 2012, competing in the No. 73 Chevrolet for CFK Motorsports. Cope made his first race of the season in his own car during the fall race a Phoenix. Cope announced that he would run a part-time schedule in 2013. During the test session in Daytona in January 2014, Cope tested the 73 car. He hired the No. 70 car, driving for Jay Robinson Racing at Phoenix International Raceway with his Toyota Camry, but after qualifying crash, although the car didn't have the backup car, the car changed to an old 2012 Chevrolet Impala.\n\nIn 2014, Cope's team bought the equipment from the defunct ML Motorsports. Youtheory agreed to sponsor Cope for the entire 2014 season, enabling Cope to race full-time for the first time since 2011. It was a much needed break for Cope, and he piloted the No. 70 Youtheory Chevrolet to a 22nd-place points finish. In January 2015, Cope announced that he would return to the Xfinity Series for the part-time 2015 season with Charlie's Soap as the sponsor. Cope returned in 2016, with him driving 28 races, Timmy Hill driving 2 races and Dexter Stacey driving the last three races of season. Cope missed the race at Daytona after issues in qualifying, but qualified the following week in Atlanta. During the Zippo 200 at The Glen, Cope radioed to his team that he was having a brake problem. Shortly after, the front end of the car exploded and black smoke blew from the car. NASCAR confiscated the car and investigated what had happened. Cope was unharmed. It was later discovered that the explosion was caused by tire failure triggered by excess heat from a broken spindle.\n\nIn January 2017, Cope closed down his Xfinity Series team after 16 years of competition. In February, it was announced that Cope would return to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, driving for Premium Motorsports. On March 3, Cope qualified for the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, his first race since 2009 at NASCAR's highest level. Cope would finish under power in 36th, after suffering power steering problems during the race. Sundance Vacations and the United Way of NEPA partnered to sponsor Cope at the Overton's 400 at Pocono. As part of Darlington Raceway's annual \"throwback\" weekend, Cope's 55 car was designed like his no. 12 Mane 'n Tail car that he drove for Bobby Allison Motorsports from 1994–1996, and Mane 'n Tail returned as the sponsor.\n\nOn September 10, 2017, Cope announced that he and Premium Motorsports had agreed to part ways, saying, \"I'm thankful to Jay Robinson and the folks at Premium for the opportunity they have given me this season to return to the Cup Series but the timing is right to pursue other opportunities.\" Two weeks later, Premium sponsor StarCom Fiber formed StarCom Racing, fielding the No. 00 for Cope at Dover. However, on September 26, 2017, StarCom Racing announced they will withdraw from Dover due to personnel hiring and timing. Cope did make his first start with StarCom at the Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas, starting 39th and finishing last after mechanical problems plagued the car. Cope's best race of the season came in the penultimate race of the season at Phoenix. He started last due to not making a qualifying run after an engine problem appeared on his #00, but spent most of the race charging through the field to place 32nd due to late-race crashes.\n\nIn January 2018, StarCom Racing announced that they had secured a charter for the 2018 Cup Series season and will run the full schedule with Cope and Jeffrey Earnhardt serving for the majority of the schedule. However, Earnhardt and StarCom split, and Landon Cassill was hired. Cope announced that they would hopefully run his No. 99 car at Texas Motor Speedway, though the team did not attempt to make that race. Cope and the 99 would make their 2018 debut at Dover International Speedway, the site of Cope's second Cup win in 1990.\n\nCope's first cousin is NASCAR crew chief, Ernie Cope.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

The screenplay, by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, is a semi-fictional account of Thomas Jefferson's tenure as the Ambassador of the United States to France before his presidency and of his alleged relationships with British artist Maria Cosway and his slave, Sally Hemings.\n\nThe film was critically and commercially unsuccessful, grossing $4.4 million on a $14 million budget.\n\nSet in the period 1784–1789, the film portrays Jefferson when he was US minister to France at Versailles before the French Revolution. French liberals and intellectuals hope he will lead them away from the corruption of the court of King Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette and toward a more democratic form of government. Although deploring the poverty of the common people, he embraces the riches of French culture and civilization. It is his first time abroad, and he takes advantage of the opportunity to extend his knowledge of liberal arts and science while absorbing the refinements France has to offer.\n\nA lonely widower, Jefferson develops a close friendship with Maria Cosway, a beautiful (and married) Anglo-Italian painter and musician. Although she becomes increasingly devoted to him, he is attached to his memory of his late wife, whom he promised that he would not remarry, and to his two younger daughters. His elder daughter is especially possessive, and Patsy becomes jealous of Maria's influence on her father. Maria becomes his confidant and correspondent, with their personal relationship becoming more affectionate as well.\n\nLater, Jefferson becomes attracted to Sally Hemings, his enslaved maid and companion of his younger daughter Polly. Three-quarters white in ancestry, she is his late wife's half-sister. Their father had taken Sally's slave mother as a concubine after he was widowed for the third time; Sally is the sixth of their children. Sally's enslaved brother James Hemings is also in Paris, learning to be a French chef for Jefferson at Monticello. When George Washington offers Jefferson the post of Secretary of State, he accepts and prepares to sail home with his family.\n\nBut James, having enjoyed his freedom in Paris, is unwilling to return to the United States and urges Sally to remain with him. It is only when Jefferson promises, making an oath upon the Bible, that he will give James and Sally their freedom that they consent to return with him. Sally is also pregnant with Jefferson's child, and Jefferson extends his oath to promise freedom to all of Sally's children as well.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Paris, at the Desert de Retz and the Palace of Versailles. The scenes at the Desert reenact the actual visit made by Jefferson and Cosway in September 1787. Many of French supporting cast are members of Comédie-Française. It premiered at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAntonio Sacchini's opera \"Dardanus\" appears in the film. Also Marc-Antoine Charpentier' \"Leçons de ténèbres\", performed by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants with Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, Sandrine Piau, Sophie Daneman, and Jory Vinikour. Arcangelo Corelli's \"La Folia\" is performed by Nolte, Scacchi, and Paltrow; however, the soundtrack CD is re-dubbed by others. Although Gwyneth Paltrow studied harpsichord for the film, her playing is dubbed by Jory Vinikour, including pieces by Jacques Duphly and Claude Balbastre. Scacchi's performance of Maria Cosway's song, \"Mormora,\" was dubbed.\n\nThe film was budgeted at $14 million. It grossed $2,473,668 in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of February 2018, \"Jefferson in Paris\" holds a rating of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.\n\nIn her positive review in the \"New York Times\", Janet Maslin called the film\n\nan extraordinary spectacle ... the rare contemporary film that's both an entertainment and an education, despite some glaring misimpressions that are sure to spark heated debate ... The biggest problem with [the film] is at the basic editing level, with such abrupt jumps between diverse scenes that the film's momentum remains choppy. Overshadowed by its own ambition and not-quite-ironic pageantry, \"Jefferson in Paris\" doesn't quite come to life ... Casting Nick Nolte as a Founding Father may sound like this film's riskiest choice, but in fact it makes solid sense. Beyond having the right physical stature for the imposing, sandy-haired Jefferson, Mr. Nolte captures the man's vigor and his stiff sense of propriety. He may not adapt effortlessly to the role of an intellectual giant, but his performance is thoroughly creditable ... The film makers fare less successfully with Maria Cosway ... Ms. Scacchi, the film's big casting problem, makes her so bloodless and prettily artificial that the romance never seems real. There's much more spice in Ms. Newton's captivating performance as Sally Hemings, even if she gives this teen-age slave girl the unexpected fiddle-dee-dee flirtatiousness of a Scarlett O'Hara.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" observed in a less positive review of the film that,\n\nThe film is lavishly produced and visually splendid, like all the Merchant-Ivory productions. But what is it about? Revolution? History? Slavery? Romance? No doubt a lot of research and speculation went into Jhabvala's screenplay, but I wish she had finally decided to jump one way or the other. The movie tells no clear story and has no clear ideas.\n\nIn a negative review appearing in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Peter Travers said,\n\nAfter a literate and entertaining roll (\"A Room With a View\", \"Howards End\", \"The Remains of the Day\"), the team of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala drops the ball with this droopy, snail-paced prigs-in-wigs movie. It doesn't help that Nick Nolte is such a lox as Thomas Jefferson ... [He] seems to think that playing an introspective man means impersonating a wax dummy.\n\nEdward Guthmann of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the film \"dull, sluggish and unfocused ... [it] tries telling three or four stories at once, can't decide which is most important and winds up stubbing its well-manicured toes\" and added,\n\nCoiffed in a strawberry blond ponytail that makes him look like sitcom star Brett Butler, and surrounded by opulent sets and costumes that look like early bids for Oscar nominations, Nolte makes a noble, sympathetic effort to humanize a historical figure, but never manages to look anything other than tight, corseted and out of his element.\n\nIn \"Variety\", Todd McCarthy said the film\n\ntouches upon much significant history, incident and emotion but, ironically, lacks the intrigue and drama of great fiction ... as the opportunity for drama increases with the onset of Jefferson's affair with Sally and the buildup toward the Revolution, the narrative becomes more dispersed and murky. Things happen ... but they don't weave and dovetail in the surprising, intricate and telling ways they can in first-class fiction, some of Merchant Ivory's recent films included ... The strong points of director James Ivory's approach here are his attentiveness to wonderful detail ... The downside is that Ivory's reticence makes it additionally tough for an emotionally remote figure like Jefferson to come alive onscreen.\n\nIt was the first portrayal in film of Sally Hemings, and at the time most Jefferson scholars disputed the rumors, started in 1802 by a vengeful journalist named James Callender, that Jefferson had fathered a child by her. Since then, a 1998 \"Nature\" study found a match between the male lines of a Jefferson and one descendant of Hemings. In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation issued its own report on the DNA test results in light of other historical evidence and said that it was likely that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings, the youngest child of Sally, and \"perhaps\" the father of all six, four of whom lived to adulthood, although this claim is heavily disputed.\n\n\n"}

Garcia first appears in an 11 September 1064 settlement with Suero, Bishop of Mondoñedo, his father confirming the agreement.\n\nIn the 1065 division of his father's estates, García was given the County of Galicia, \"elevated to the rank of kingdom\", that extended south to the Mondego River in Portugal with the \"parias\" of the Taifa of Badajoz and Seville; his eldest brother Sancho received the Kingdom of Castile and the \"parias\" of the Taifa of Zaragoza.. The second son and his father's favorite, Alfonso, fared best in this division, being given an expanded Kingdom of León that encroached on lands that historically had been Castilian and Galician. Garcia's Galician kingdom was the most troubled, including lands south of the Duero over which firm administrative control had only been reestablished with the recapture of Coimbra the year before Ferdinand's death. Further, Ferdinand had begun a process intended to weaken the old comital house to bring the nobles more under direct royal control, but not yet finalized at his death. Further, the bishops of Lugo and Santiago were competing for preeminence.\n\nAmong García's first acts was to receive the forced surrender of nearly the entire holdings of prominent nobleman García Múñoz. He also initiated plans to reestablish bishoprics at Braga, Lamego and Tui, as further tools for asserting royal authority, but suffered a significant setback when in 1068 the long-serving Bishop of Santiago died, then his successor was murdered the next year, an act that can be seen as a direct challenge to the king who might have been viewed as acting in an overly energetic manner, and indicating a loss of royal authority in Galicia. García seems to have turned his attention to strengthening his control in the south. There he faced a challenge in early 1071 by the rebel Count of Portugal, Nuno Mendes, whom García would defeat and kill at the Battle of Pedroso. \n\nGarcía's brother and neighboring ruler, Alfonso, had been taking an interest in the increasingly unstable Galicia from at least 1070, and in May or early June 1071, he invaded Galicia and northern Portugal. Sancho likely acquiesced in this in exchange for partial control over the realm formerly belonging to his youngest brother. This scenario was untenable, as Alfonso's entire realm separated Sancho from Galicia, and the prospect of this further strengthening the already disproportionate power given Alfonso by their father was likely a driving force behind Sancho's attack on León that resulted in Alfonso's defeat and exile in 1072. Sancho then turned his attention to García in central Portugal, defeating him near Santarém and briefly imprisoning him in Castile (one chronicle specifying at Burgos) before he was then allowed to flee to Seville. This reunited the realm their father had divided, and García's independent kingdom of Galicia and Portugal ceased to exist.\n\nEvents later in the same year precipitated García's return. In October, 1072, Sancho was assassinated at Zamora while suppressing a rebellion led by their sister Urraca, who had been given the rule of Zamora, and nobleman Pedro Ansúrez. Both dethroned brothers returned north, with Alfonso seizing Sancho's reunited realm. It is unclear if García hoped to reestablish himself in his kingdom or had been misled by promises of safety from Alfonso, but in February 1073, García was invited to a conference with Alfonso and there taken prisoner. The earliest chronicles do not give the place of his imprisonment, but later chronicles put it at the castle of Luna, near León. There he remained until his death in or about 1090, the date given on his epitaph, due to a bloodletting after he developed a fever.\n\nKing Garcia stated that he wished to be buried in chains, as he lived the final days of his life, and the king was represented as such on his tomb in the royal pantheon at the Basílica de San Isidoro, León. It included an inscription, since destroyed, that was reported to have borne a Latin epitaph:\n\nin English:\n\nIt is uncertain that this epitaph was carved immediately after García's death, but it served as the basis for historian Ângelo Ribeiro to conclude that García was the first to use the title \"King of Portugal\". Because García died while the Council of León was in session, his funeral was attended by many eminent prelates, including papal legate Reniere, the future pope Pascal II.\n\nGarcía's capture by trickery, long imprisonment and burial in great pomp made him a favorite of epic poets, and by the middle of the 12th century there was already a body of such poetic works. The earliest of these to survive is the 16th century ballad, \"Muerte de don García, rey de Galicia, desposeído por sus hermanos Sancho II y Alfonso VI de Castilla\" (The Death of García, king of Galicia, dispossessed by his brothers Sancho II and Alfonso VI of Castile), by Lorenzo de Sepúlveda. \n\n"}

With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated \"slice by slice\" until it realizes, usually too late, that it is virtually gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the 'sliced' sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion.\n\nThe term \"salami tactics\" () was coined in the late 1940s by the Stalinist Communist Mátyás Rákosi to describe the actions of the Hungarian Communist Party in its ultimately successful drive for complete power in Hungary. Rákosi claimed he destroyed the non-Communist parties by \"cutting them off like slices of salami.\" By portraying his opponents as fascists (or at the very least fascist sympathizers), he was able to get the opposition to slice off its right wing, then its centrists, then some left wingers, until only those Fellow travellers willing to collaborate with the Communists remained in power.\n\nSalami tactics are discussed by the British Chief Scientific Adviser in the \"Yes, Prime Minister\" episode, \"The Grand Design\".\n\nIn the 2016 film \"Arrival\", Agent Halpern mentions a Hungarian word meaning to eliminate your enemies one by one. It is thought that this alludes to \"szalámitaktika.\" Indeed, this is cited in Amazon Prime X-Ray (1:07:50).\n\n\n"}

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is a 25-year-old man who sleeps in a bunk bed and lives with his mother. Tom is contacted by his high school classmate's mother, Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), to tell him that his \"best friend,\" Bill Abernathy, committed suicide, and is asked to give a eulogy at the funeral. Tom does not remember his friend, but out of sympathy attends the funeral as a pallbearer. While Ruth struggles with her loss and Tom with his supposedly failed memory, the two develop a romance. Meanwhile, Tom's unrequited high school crush, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), re-enters his life.\n\nAt Abernathy's funeral, Tom's vague and impersonal eulogy confuses the Abernathy family and amuses Tom's friends. Julie, upset at their lack of respect, tries to leave as the pallbearers carry Bill's coffin out of the church. Tom, one of the pallbearers, drags the coffin and the rest of the pallbearers after Julie. He asks her if she knew Bill; she replies that she did not know Bill, but was saddened by the image of Bill in the coffin. Tom asks Julie out for coffee still holding up Bill's coffin. Bill's relatives, upset about Tom's indifference towards Bill, forcefully relieve him of his duty as a pallbearer. Visibly upset, Ruth states that Tom is in Bill's will.\n\nAfterwards, Tom calls Julie about the coffee date and Julie asks if Scott and Cynthia can come along for a double date. During dinner with Scott and Cynthia, it is apparent that Julie and Scott have more in common and listen to the same musicians. Conversation between Tom and Julie is stilted and awkward, while Scott slips up and reveals that Tom still lives with his mother.\n\nDisgusted by Scott's behavior during dinner, Tom reluctantly follows through with the plan to drive Julie home. When they reach Julie's home, Julie reveals that she remembered Tom in high school. As Tom leans in for a kiss, Julie turns her head colliding against Tom's. Julie states she had given off the wrong signal to Tom, since she is planning on moving away.\n\nTom is rejected at the end of his second interview and goes to Ruth's to help pack Bill's belongings. While looking through pictures of Bill growing up, Ruth and Tom kiss and have sex on Bill's bed. Ruth tells Tom about Bill's father, a Vietnam War veteran, who is implied to have died in the war. Tom, in turn, tells Ruth about Bill's fictitious love interest based completely on Tom's infatuation with Julie. Tom and Ruth continue to see each other as Tom reveals more about his own affections for Julie in the guise of Bill's affections and Tom's attempts to forget about Julie in Ruth's arms.\n\nTom repeatedly watches Julie working at a record store while parked on the street. One day after the shop closes, Tom sees Julie let Scott into the store. Jumping into the driver's seat, Tom drives by and stops to see Scott lean in to kiss Julie. When Scott sees Tom, Tom drives off.\n\nThe next morning, Julie comes to talk to Tom about Scott's attempt of infidelity, not knowing Tom had witnessed the entire event. Reminiscing about high school band, Julie tells Tom that she wants to just drive away for a year just to be on her own. Julie invites Tom to a concert she had planned on going with her former fiancé, Jed.\n\nWhen arriving at Ruth's, Tom is rushed to a family gathering of Abernathy's. At Aunt Lucille's, Tom sees that Ruth had overheard him talking to Julie about their date later that evening. When Tom's car breaks down, Julie finds Ruth's charm bracelet, so Tom tells her that he has been helping Bill Abernathy's mother since the funeral. Julie mistakenly assumes an innocent relationship between Tom and Ruth.\n\nAfter a tow truck takes Tom and Julie back to Tom's house, Tom sneaks into his mother's room to get her car keys, while Julie enters Tom's room. Tom reveals he wanted to dance with her at a homecoming dance and she kisses him. As they fall into Tom's bed, Ruth calls Tom finding out that Julie is in the room with him.\n\nWhen Tom goes to see Brad for advice, he tells Tom to drop the bracelet with a letter into a mailbox for a clean break with Ruth. Tom does as Brad tells him and proceeds to continue dating Julie. For Julie's birthday, Julie asks Tom to go with her to meet her parents. On that morning, Tom sees Ruth carrying the envelope with her bracelet and Tom's letter, so Tom sneaks away through the back door. At brunch with Julie's parents, it is immediately apparent that her father disapproves of Tom and Julie's relationship when he keeps asking why he is there with them. After Tom pleads with Julie to abandon her plans to leave for a year, Ruth barges into the restaurant and humiliates Tom by revealing their past relationship.\n\nAt Brad's bachelor party, Tom makes a scene at the strip club telling Brad not to marry Lauren. Tom says Lauren is an albatross around his neck and Scott thinks so as well. The next day, Scott apologizes to Tom and they reconcile. While talking about past crushes growing up, they both realize that there was another Tom who moved away after junior high school. Tom brings the other Tom to Ruth, who appreciates the gesture to reminisce about her son. They come to an understanding about needing someone at the time, Ruth mourning her son and Tom being rejected by his childhood crush, Julie.\n\nAt Brad's wedding, Tom patches his friendship with Brad approving of his marriage to Lauren, as Scott and Cynthia appear to talk civilly together hinting of reconciliation. During the reception, Tom sees Julie and gives her the keys to his car as a belated birthday present for her trip. She hints to him from a previous conversation that she wants to dance.\n\nTom gets a new job and moves into Julie's apartment while she is on her trip.\n\n\n\"The Pallbearer\" opened at #9 in its opening weekend (5/3-5) with $2,319,236. By the end of its run, the film had made $7,656,388 in the United States.\n\nThe review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes reported that 45% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.12/10.\n\n"}

At the beginning of the film, the two are driving towards the Kentucky farmhouse, Kilronan, where Jackson grew up, primarily to introduce Helen to Jackson's mother, Martha, during the Christmas holidays. They arrive late in the evening and go straight to bed. The next morning Helen awakens to Martha arranging the room, as she thought Helen was asleep in the other bedroom. During their stay Martha tries to convince Jackson to stay to help her run the farm. Helen notices that Martha cleans their room and arranges their things every day, including Helen's contraceptive.\n\nAfter returning to New York in the new year, Helen discovers she is pregnant after getting violently ill at work. When she informs Jackson of this, he asks her to marry him and she accepts. The wedding is held at Kilronan, where Helen meets Jackson's paternal grandmother, Alice, who tells Helen she doesn't trust Martha. Alice points out Martha is extremely smart and capable of doing the farmwork of four men. Before Alice can say more Martha interrupts.\n\nAfter the wedding they return to their New York apartment. Helen is assaulted by a burglar who steals her locket and makes sexual advances. When Helen tells him she's pregnant, he cuts her abdomen and leaves. The fetus is not injured.\n\nMartha arrives unannounced, saying she wants to sell Kilronan because she cannot run it alone. Helen tells Jackson she wants to move to Kentucky and in with Martha for a year and help renovate the land. Jackson tells Helen his father died in that house when he was seven and he blames himself because he ran into his father, pushing him down the stairs to his death. Jackson also tells Helen that his father had been cheating on Martha with a woman named Robin Hayes. Helen says they should go back to the farm so Jackson can face his \"old ghosts\".\n\nThe couple move in with Martha, who attempts to divide them with subversive comments and manipulating the family friends and neighbors. When Helen goes to the doctor, she finds out Martha told him Helen wanted to have the baby at the house, even though Helen had never said that. Suspicious and increasingly annoyed, Helen talks to Alice who tells her that Jackson is not responsible for his father's death. He had landed on a nail puller at the bottom of the stairs, crushing his sternum, which, according to news reports was a freak accident. When Helen returns that evening she finds Jackson calling around asking for her whereabouts with Martha hovering close by. Helen's frigid attitude toward her mother-in-law prompts Martha to visit Alice and warn her to stay away from them.\n\nHaving had enough of Martha's manipulations, Helen tells Jackson that Martha is tearing their marriage apart. He agrees to go back to New York and tells his mother, who appears to accept it gracefully. Martha is completely convinced the baby will be a boy, and that Helen is a bad influence on her son and unborn grandchild.\n\nJackson leaves the farm on a work call, leaving Helen and Martha alone. That evening, Martha bakes a strawberry cheesecake for Helen laced with pitocin, a labor inducer. Helen wakes up the next morning, feeling strange. She discovers a baby room set up by Martha and finds the locket that was stolen from her in New York amongst the baby clothes. When Martha unexpectedly enters the room, Helen tries unsuccessfully to escape, driving to a neighboring farm and coming face to face with her attacker from New York, then attempting to escape on foot before Martha captures her at the side of the highway.\n\nReluctantly, Helen gives birth at the house, with Martha looking on, offering assistance, but refusing to give Helen painkillers. Martha leaves the room to answer a phone call from Jackson. She tells him that everything is okay, but when Helen screams in pain, Martha hangs up.\n\nHelen eventually gives birth to a healthy boy. She begs Martha to hand her the baby, but Martha ignores her, telling the baby she is his mother. Martha tries to inject a needle full of morphine in Helen's arm, but Helen knocks the syringe away. By the time Martha retrieves it, she hears Jackson's footsteps in the house. In a scramble, she quickly cleans up, meeting Jackson at the door with the newborn baby. She tells him to leave Helen alone, as he has no idea what she's been through. The two leave Helen asleep, and Martha gives the baby to Jackson.\n\nThat night, Martha enters Helen's bedroom with the syringe, but she finds Jackson awake in a chair next to the bed. Despite his mother's insistence that he return to bed, he stays, thereby thwarting her plan. The next morning, Helen awakens to see Jackson with the baby. As Helen finally holds her child she tells Jackson to ask Martha to make breakfast for them.\n\nAt breakfast, Helen enters the house with an object in her bag. Helen says that it is the object that killed Jackson's father. She proceeds to tell Jackson the whole truth about his father's murder. She reveals that Robin Hayes, the \"woman\" Jackson believed his father had cheated on his mother with, was actually a male horse wrangler, with whom Martha had an affair. Helen also shows Jackson a vicious bruise from Martha's attempt to murder her so she could have him and their son to herself. Jackson's father was planning to leave Martha when he discovered the affair but Martha ended up killing him. Martha made Jackson think he did so she can bind him to her for the rest of his life. Jackson tells Martha that he never wants to see her again. Martha claims that Helen is only doing this because she is jealous of her. In utter disgust, Helen slaps Martha to the ground. Helen and Jackson then leave with their baby while Martha sobs on the floor, her hopes dashed.\n\nIn the final scene, the couple visit Alice before they leave for good, presenting her with her great-grandson.\n\n\nIntrada released a limited edition album of Christopher Young's score on November 12, 2012.\n\n\nThe movie has earned a 13% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes movie review website based on 39 reviews, widely panned by critics.\n\nRoger Ebert has been quoted as saying that Hush is \"the kind of movie where you walk in, watch the first 10 minutes, know exactly where it's going, and hope devoutly that you're wrong. It's one of those Devouring Woman movies where the villainess never plays a scene without a drink and a cigarette, and the hero is inattentive to the victim to the point of dementia.\"\n\nJessica Lange earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress, losing to the Spice Girls for \"Spice World\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2216320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216320", "title": "Don Wilson (announcer)", "text": "Don Wilson (announcer)\n\nDon Wilson (September 1, 1900 – April 25, 1982) was an American announcer and actor in radio and television, with a Falstaffian vocal presence, remembered best as the rotund announcer and comic foil to the star of \"The Jack Benny Program\".\n\nWilson played football for the University of Colorado in the 20s. For his size he was an excellent sportsman, and was an excellent amateur golfer, teaming up with fellow NBC announcer Bud Stevens to win many matches in Southern California. \nWilson began his radio career as a singer over Denver radio station KFEL in 1923. By 1929, he was working at KFI, and shortly afterwards for Don Lee at KHJ, in Los Angeles. In a 1978 appearance on \"Tomorrow with Tom Snyder\", Wilson claimed he was fired from KHJ because he had bought a Packard from Earle C. Anthony, the business arch-rival of Cadillac dealer Don Lee and owner of KFI and KECA.\n\nThough best known for his comedy work with Benny, Wilson had a background as a sportscaster, covering the opening of the 1932 Summer Olympics. Don appeared in two Broadway shows in the 1930s, \"The Passionate Pilgrim\", which opened October 19, 1932, and \"The First Legion\", which opened October 1, 1934. Wilson first worked with Benny on the broadcast of April 6, 1934, concurrent with a short stint as announcer on George Gershwin's series, \"Music by Gershwin\". At and , Wilson possessed a resonant voice, a deep belly laugh, and a plump figure, all of which would become important parts of his character with Benny. Though Wilson's primary function as announcer was to read the opening and the commercial pitches — notably for Jell-O, Grape-Nuts, and Lucky Strike — his importance to the program was as both feed and foil to Jack and other cast members. A recurring goal was his effort to get the Sportsmen Quartet singing commercials approved by Benny.\n\nOn radio in particular, Wilson's girth could be exploited, both in jokes by Benny and in audio gags, such as the amount of time it took a railroad porter to brush the soot off of Don following a train trip, or to measure charging him by the pound.\n\nWilson rarely flubbed his lines. His most famous incident occurred on the January 8, 1950 broadcast. The script called for him to refer to columnist Drew Pearson, but Wilson read the name as \"Dreer Pooson.\" Later on in the broadcast, during a murder-mystery skit, Frank Nelson was instructed – without Jack Benny's knowledge – to take advantage of the situation. Benny asked Nelson, \"Pardon me, are you the doorman?\" and Nelson, in his customary sarcastic manner, came back with: \"Well who do you think I am, Dreer Pooson?,\" to sustained laughter and applause.\n\nWilson also served stints as announcer for radio comedy or variety shows starring Alan Young, Bing Crosby, Ginny Simms, and Fanny Brice's comedy hit \"Baby Snooks\". In 1946, Don Wilson was a regular on the daytime comedy \"Glamour Manor\", opposite former \"Jack Benny Program\" regular Kenny Baker.\n\nWilson accompanied Benny into television in 1950, remaining with him through the end of the series in 1965. On television, the fat jokes were toned down only slightly, mostly because the real Wilson was not as impossibly large as the radio Wilson was described. These appearances also often involved the fictional character of Don's equally hefty, aspiring announcer son, Harlow (played by Dale White). Wilson co-starred with Benny in \"Buck Benny Rides Again\" (1940) and voicing a caricature of himself in \"The Mouse that Jack Built\", a 1959 Warner Brothers spoof of \"The Jack Benny Program\" directed by Robert McKimson. Wilson appeared in the Broadway show \"Make a Million\", which opened on October 23, 1958.\n\nIn 1959, Wilson appeared as a flim-flam preacher in the episode, \"Gates Ajar Morgan\", on the syndicated anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Morgan promotes a false religious philosophy based on the novel \"The Gates Ajar\". He must confess the sham to save his friend and benefactor from a lynch mob. The episode also features Chris Alcaide and Sue Randall.\n\nHis other film roles included small appearances as announcers or commentators in several films, providing narration for Walt Disney's Academy Award nominated short \"Ferdinand the Bull\", and a credited appearance as Mr. Kettering opposite Marilyn Monroe in \"Niagara\". His role in the film \"Village Barn Dance\" was acclaimed by a review that said, \"Surprise performance was that of Don Wilson ... who steals the show with his portrayal of a good-humored, grinning radio announcer.\"\n\nWilson did frequent commercials and appeared in the Western Union Candygram commercials as their spokesman from 1969 through 1971. Those who recall the commercial remember him blaring out \"Just tell them I want to send a Candygram.\"\n\nHis final on-camera appearance in a series was in two episodes of the 1960s \"Batman\" as newscaster Walter Klondike (spoofing Walter Cronkite). Wilson would continue to appear on talk-shows throughout his life whenever a program would salute Jack Benny or talk about old-time radio.\n\nWilson was married four times. His second wife was Peggy Ann Kent, daughter of 20th Century Fox President Sidney R. Kent. They were married November 19, 1940 and divorced in December, 1942. The same month the divorce was final, Wilson married Polish countess Marusia Radunska. This marriage ended in divorce in 1949. Wilson finally found a lasting partnership with fourth wife, radio actress Lois Corbett (who occasionally appeared as \"Mrs. Wilson\" on Benny's later radio and TV shows). Together they hosted a local Palm Springs, California television show \"Town Talk\" from 1968 until the mid-1970s.\n\nWilson and his wife lived in Palm Springs after his retirement. He died of a stroke.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216322", "title": "Ready to Rumble", "text": "Ready to Rumble\n\nReady to Rumble is a 2000 American buddy comedy film directed by Brian Robbins and written by Steven Brill, which is based on Turner Broadcasting's now defunct professional wrestling promotion, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The movie draws its title from ring announcer Michael Buffer's catchphrase, \"Let's get ready to rumble!\" The movie features many wrestlers from WCW.\n\nThis film is also notable for being the media debut of future wrestler John Cena, who makes an appearance as an extra due to a scene being filmed at the gym he was training to become a wrestler at, ironically meaning the guy who would go on to become the face of WWE would first appear in a WCW movie.\n\nSewage workers Gordie Boggs and Sean Dawkins watch their favorite wrestler, WCW World Heavyweight Championship holder Jimmy King cheated out of the title by Diamond Dallas Page, an evil WCW promoter named Titus Sinclair, and DDP's partners. After the match, the two wrestling fans humorously express their rage in their septic truck, resulting in a car crash with Gordie and Sean surviving.\n\nAfter this event, Gordie believes that the car crash was supposed to happen and that they should make Jimmy King once again a title holder. Sean agrees to help Gordie, and the dimwitted duo go on a quest to put their King back on his throne. The next day, Gordie asks a friend to find out where the washed-up wrestler lives. Their friend succeeds, and they go to an unexpected-looking neighborhood. They find King's estranged wife and his parents. The parents tell them that King borrowed their mobile home, and never returned it. The duo find King and become over-excited. They have a conversation, and when King says that he gives up on wrestling, Gordie and Sean anger him to the point where he suddenly attacks the two boys. The boys encourage King to beat them up, which influenced him to return to wrestling. Then Gordie and Sean are knocked out when Jimmy King does his finishing move.\n\nThe two boys wake up the next day when Jimmy King drips beer on their faces. Later that day, the trio go on a road trip. Gordie sends letters to his father, who wanted Gordie to follow in his footsteps to be a policeman, but Gordie says that he will not join him in a policeman test, making him frustrated. Gordie, King, and Sean go to the WCW arena where they hide King in a bathroom and they meet one of the Nitro Girls, Sasha. When DDP mocks Jimmy King on camera, King comes out of the bathroom and beats him up. Sinclair, therefore, declares a Steel Cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship plus a $1,000,000 cash prize. However, if King loses, he will never wrestle again.\n\nSasha is impressed by Gordie, and they go to her apartment, where she reveals her \"secret weapons\" (she shows her breasts). Gordie reacts like a wrestling fan he is by screaming foreign objects and pushing her off of him. Jimmy King was in deep need of a trainer. They went to a local training center, where King meets his former partner, Bill Goldberg. They also find Sal Bandini, who beat up King. He was then hired as their trainer, but he became hospitalized when Sid Vicious and Perry Saturn attacked him that night.\n\nWhen they try to get a new partner for King, Gordie's father comes along, gets Gordie and convinces him that his dream of working with Jimmy King was stupid. When Gordie was at home, Sean and King tried to bust him out, but Gordie refused (an ironic change in Gordie as he once encouraged King to return to wrestling). But the next day, Gordie comes at an entourage audition and is thanked by King for everything Gordie did for him. No one, however, was able to make the cut, and so King has to face DDP alone. When the Steel Cage Match started, he is again outnumbered by DDP's goons, but receives help from Goldberg, Booker T, Billy Kidman, the Disco Inferno, Sting, and of course Gordie (in a police uniform). After this, Titus was beaten up by Sean and Gordie (as well as by the fans). Goldberg later asks King to re-team with him, but the new champ announces his new partner will be Gordie and their manager will be Sean.\n\nAn epilogue shows Sean telling kids \"dreams can come true\" back at the convenience store, where Gordie and Goldberg teach the clerk a lesson by hurling him out on the street for being mean to kids. All ends happily as the heroes ride off in a stretch Hummer (driven by Nitro Girl Chae), together with Sal, now fully recovered in a hot tub with beautiful women.\n\n\n\nThe character of Sal Bandini is based on wrestlers Lou Thesz and Stu Hart. Oliver Platt accidentally struck Randy Savage in the face during the filming of a fantasy scene. The footage of the incident, which was shot over Savage's shoulder, can be seen in the blooper reel shown during the closing credits. Chris Kanyon was Platt's stunt double, and Shane Helms was David Arquette's stunt double. The character of Titus Sinclair is based on WCW President and Executive Producer Eric Bischoff, who was originally planned to star in this movie as a fictionalized version of himself, but was fired from WCW before filming began.\n\nFollowing the release of the movie, WCW decided to generate publicity for the company by running a storyline in which David Arquette, a legitimate wrestling fan, became WCW World Champion. The storyline was reviled by wrestling fans, and Arquette himself reportedly believed it was a bad idea, as he felt that it would damage the value of the belt he held in such high regard. While in WCW, he aligned himself with Diamond Dallas Page (despite Page being the movie's villain) and agreed in storyline to drop the title to him. He eventually lost the title in the main event of Slamboree involving the three-tiered cage seen in \"Ready to Rumble\", pitting himself against Page and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when he turned on Page and allowed Jarrett to win. Arquette later donated all the money WCW paid him to the families of the late Brian Pillman, the late Brian Hildebrand and paralyzed wrestler Darren Drozdov.\n\nThe Triple Cage was used by WCW only twice: first, at Slamboree 2000, Jeff Jarrett beat Diamond Dallas Page and David Arquette (defending the WCW World Heavyweight Championship) to win the title. In this match, Chris Kanyon was thrown from the roof of one of the cages, \"paralyzing\" him. The other, taking place on the September 4, 2000 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", was the 2000 edition of the WarGames match.\n\n\"Ready to Rumble\" received a largely negative reception, garnering a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 23% based on 70 reviews, with an average score of 3.9/10. Its consensus states, \"Humor at its lowest that isn't funny for kids and is insulting to adults\". On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 23, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert said that the movie works best when focusing on the aspects of professional wrestling instead of the \"wheezy prefab\" \"Dumb and Dumber\" antics and felt there was misuse of both Platt and Landau, citing the former's comedic talents being wasted and having an actual wrestler in his place instead, and the latter being more suitable in dramatic works. BBC film reviewer Neil Smith commended the efforts of both Platt and Landau in their respective roles but felt the film overall was the typical Hollywood comedy, consisting of \"oafish slapstick and lavatorial humour in place of genuine wit or imagination\", concluding that it \"has its moments, but ultimately feels just as bogus as the Lycra-clad charlatans it lionises.\" \"The A.V. Club\"s Nathan Rabin criticized the filmmakers for trying to satirize and indulge in the world of wrestling and ignore it for rehashed humor from films like \"The Wedding Singer\" and \"Mallrats\", concluding that, \"[I]n its attempts not to offend wrestling fans or the wrestlers who make brief, bland appearances, \"Ready To Rumble\" is plodding, obvious, toothless, and unfunny.\"\n\nA. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" mockingly said that the film does a deep exploration into the world of professional wrestling and its core fanbase, but in reality is \"not a satire of the idiocy [of professional wrestling], but a long, self-satisfied wallow in it.\" Chris Gramlich of \"Exclaim!\" backhandedly called it \"the best Hollywood wrestling movie since \"No Holds Barred\"\", giving credit to Chris Kanyon's wrestling choreography, the various WCW performers and the contributions from both Landau and McGowan being the film's saving graces, concluding that, \"While \"Ready to Rumble\" may at times make even the most ardent wrestling ashamed by its use of wrestling stereotypes (some even justified); it does make you laugh almost as often. Almost.\" \"The Austin Chronicle\"s Marjorie Baumgarten agreed with the critics about the \"asinine plot, premise, and performances\" but admitted to laughing at a few moments that shows the film being honest with itself about its creation, concluding that, \"Filled with lots of appearances by real wrestling stars, the movie seems a certain shoo-in among a certain demographic. But if you're going, hit the theatres soon because this one looks ready to tumble.\"\n\nThe film score makes extensive use of classical music, both diegetic and non-diegetic. \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" by Aaron Copland is featured as Jimmy King's theme music. \"Siegfried's Funeral March\" from \"Götterdämmerung\" by German composer Richard Wagner plays quietly in the background during King's initial discomfiture at the hands of Titus Sinclair, played by Joe Pantoliano, and Diamond Dallas Page.\n\nA soundtrack for the film was released by Atlantic Records and 143 Records in both 'clean' and 'explicit' editions. Considering the Kid Rock song \"Badwitdaba\", the Lower Than You remix, is not deleted on the iTunes version of this soundtrack, it remained one of the only songs of Kid Rock to be available on iTunes, until most of his catalog was released on iTunes in 2013.\n\n"}

He was one of the first converts to Smith's Church of Christ. Morley was present at many of the early events of the Latter Day Saint movement, and served as a church leader in Ohio, Missouri and Utah Territory.\n\nMorley was born on March 11, 1786 in Montague, Massachusetts, one of nine children of Thomas E. Morley and Editha (née Marsh). He served in the War of 1812 from 1812–15, and later held the position of captain in the Ohio militia.\n\nIn June 1812, Morley married Lucy Gunn in Massachusetts, with whom he had seven children. Some years after becoming a member of the church in 1830, he practiced plural marriage, taking Leonora Snow (the older sister of Lorenzo and Eliza R. Snow) and Hannah Blakesley (also found as Blaixly or Blakeslee) as his second and third wife in 1844 in Nauvoo, Illinois. Blakesley bore him an additional three children. Other wives included Hannah Knight Libby and Harriet Lucinda Cox, married 1846 in Nauvoo, Hannah Sibley and Nancy Anne Bache (also found as Back).\n\nMorley was an early settler in the Western Reserve wilderness area of northern Ohio, and created a productive farm in the region near Kirtland, Ohio. While in this area, he joined the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement (aka the Campbellites), under the ministry of Sidney Rigdon, and was a leader of a utopian group that practiced communal principals, holding goods in common for the benefit of all. Members of this group included Lyman Wight, and Morley's brother-in-law Titus Billings. Eight additional families joined in 1830. The society was sometimes called the \"Morley Family,\" as Rigdon caused a row of log houses to be built on Morley's farm, where a number of the society's members could live periodically.\n\nIn November 1830, Morley was among the first converts to the newly organized Church of Christ, the original name of the Latter Day Saint church founded by Joseph Smith. He was introduced to the teachings of Smith when Oliver Cowdery and several missionary companions passed through Ohio. He was ordained an Elder shortly after his baptism.\n\nWhen Joseph Smith and his family came to Kirtland, Ohio for the first time, they lived with Isaac Morley. He later built a small house for them on his farm, where Joseph's and Emma's twins, Thaddeus and Louisa, were born and died only three hours later on April 30, 1831. Isaac's daughter, Lucy and her elder sister kept house for Emma while she was ill.\n\nMorley was ordained a High Priest on June 3, 1831 by Lyman Wight, and was immediately selected for a leadership position. He was ordained, on 6 June, as First Counselor to Bishop Edward Partridge and served until Partridge's death in 1840.\n\nIn June 1831, Morley was asked to sell his farm and act as a missionary while traveling to Independence, Missouri with Ezra Booth (see: Doctrine and Covenants 52:23). While in Missouri, Morley first faced the violence generated by disagreements and misunderstandings between Mormon settlers and Missouri residents. In July 1833, a mob of about 500 men demolished the home and printing office of William Wines Phelps at Independence and tarred and feathered Bishop Partridge. Willing to be injured or killed, Morley and five others stepped forward and offered themselves as a ransom for these men. After negotiation, the Missouri citizens agreed to stop the violence and the Mormons agreed to leave the county by April 1, 1834. Morley left Missouri and returned to Kirtland in early 1835. He was in attendance at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple in March 1836 and was among the first to receive the washing and anointing also known as the \"initiatory\".\n\nIn 1835, with Bishop Partridge, Morley served a mission in the Eastern States. They returned to Kirtland on 5 November 1835; on 7 November Pres. Smith wrote:\n\nThe word of the Lord came to me, saying: \"Behold I am well pleased with my servant Isaac Morley and my servant Edward Partridge, because of the integrity of their hearts in laboring in my vineyard, for the salvation of the souls of men.\n\nMorley returned to Missouri with his family in early 1836, and helped establish the city of Far West. At a general church assembly on November 7, 1837, he was chosen as Patriarch of Far West and ordained under the hands of Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith. He lived in Far West until he was arrested with fifty-five other Mormon citizens on the basis of the Extermination Order of Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. The citizens were taken by the Missouri militia to Richmond, Ray county, to await trial. After being held for three weeks, all the prisoners were released by Judge Austin A. King on November 24, 1838.\n\nUpon leaving Missouri with the expelled Saints, Morley settled in Hancock County, Illinois, in a settlement called Yelrome (from the reverse spelling of \"Morley\"). There he established a prosperous business as a cooper. In October 1840, Hyrum Smith appointed Morley to serve as president of the stake centered in Lima, Illinois, with John Murdock and Walter Cox as counselors. In March 1845, he was selected to be a member of the Council of Fifty. However, in September 1845, his houses, cooper's shop, property and grain were burned by a mob, and his family took refuge in the Mormon center of Nauvoo. From there, they moved to Winter Quarters, where Morley's first wife, Lucy, died.\n\nMorley emigrated to the Great Salt Lake Valley in 1848 with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) following the death of Joseph Smith, and is considered the founder of Manti, Utah. After Ute Indian leader Wakara invited Church president Brigham Young to send Mormon colonists to the Sanpitch (now Sanpete) Valley in central Utah, Young dispatched Morley and James Russell Ivie as leaders of the first company of 225 settlers. Morley and his group felt that part of the purpose of the settlement was to bring the gospel to the Indians. He wrote, \"Did we come here to enrich ourselves in the things of this world? No. We were sent to enrich the Natives and comfort the hearts of the long oppressed.\" (May, p. 104)\n\nMorley and the settlers arrived at the present location of Manti in November 1849, and established a winter camp, digging temporary shelters into the south side of the hill on which the Manti Utah Temple now stands. It was an isolated place, at least four days by wagon from the nearest settlement. Relations between the Mormons and the local Utes were helpful and cooperative. The first winter was severe and, although the settlers were fairly well supplied, they had great difficulties. A measles epidemic broke out and the settlers used their limited medicine to nurse the Indians. When supplies ran low, Indians helped settlers haul food on sleds through the snow.\n\nMorley encouraged the settlers in their work and assured them that their community would grow to be one of the best in the mountains. The settlers and members of the Ute Sanpitch tribe referred to him affectionately as \"Father Morley\". Morley supervised the building of the first schoolhouse and the first gristmill in Sanpete Valley. The Sanpete Valley settlement grew and prospered and became known as a prime agricultural area.\n\nMorley served as a senator in the general assembly of the provisional State of Deseret. In 1851, 1853 and 1855, he represented Sanpete county in the legislative council of the Utah Territory.\n\nDuring his last years, Morley spent most of his time on his calling as a Patriarch, conferring priesthood blessings on thousands of church members. He died on June 24, 1865 in Fairview, Sanpete County, Utah.\n\nOn a wall inside the Manti Utah Temple is a framed piece of temple clothing used by Morley in the Nauvoo Temple when he was endowed there.\n\n\n"}

The backronym M.A.F.I.A. stands for Masters At Finding Intelligent Attitudes. They were formed and mentored by New York rapper, The Notorious B.I.G.. In 1995, they released their debut album, \"Conspiracy\". The success of the group's singles, \"Player's Anthem\" (US #13) and \"Get Money\" (US #17), helped launch the career of Lil' Kim as a solo artist.\n\nThe group disbanded shortly after the murder of The Notorious B.I.G., with Lil' Kim and Lil' Cease continuing on with their solo careers. In 2005, three of the members (not including Lil’ Kim) released a second album under the Junior M.A.F.I.A. name.\n\nThe members of Junior M.A.F.I.A. met as childhood friends of The Notorious B.I.G.. All the members were under the age of twenty when the group was formed. The group was formed from three separate groups and four individuals if not including The Notorious B.I.G.. The 6s, or 666, (Lil' Cease, Bugsy, Capone, Chico, and Nino Brown), The Snakes (cousins Larceny and Trife), MC Klepto, Mr. Bristal, Chico Del Vec, and Lil' Kim, (a.k.a. Big Momma and or The Lieutenant), the only female artist in the group. The 6s knew The Notorious B.I.G. before he was rapping. The Notorious B.I.G. acted as the \"godfather\" to the group.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Conspiracy\", in 1995, under the NYC-based Big Beat Records and Undeas labels. The album was produced in a similar style to The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut, \"Ready to Die\" \"successful[ly] [replicating]... the earlier record's strengths\". B.I.G. featured on four of the album's tracks. The rhyme topics were hard-hitting, mostly addressing guns, money, and sex. The album featured production by DJ Clark Kent, EZ Elpee, Daddy-O, Akshun, and Special Ed. \"Conspiracy\" gained some positive reviews, but received criticism for some of its group members not showing enough individuality. It debuted at number eight on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 69,000 copies in its first week of release and was later certified gold.\n\nThe lead single \"Player's Anthem\", produced by DJ Clark Kent and featuring The Notorious B.I.G., went gold. The accompanying video showed the group flying on helicopters and Learjets whilst carrying out business under F.B.I. surveillance. The album also spawned the popular top twenty hit \"Get Money\", a duet featuring The Notorious B.I.G. and Lil' Kim, and its remix \"Gettin' Money\", which has Lil' Cease with B.I.G. & Lil' Kim. The single was certified platinum and helped Kim start her own solo career. \"I Need You Tonight\" (featuring Aaliyah) was the only single released from the album that did not feature The Notorious B.I.G. The music video featured the members and Aaliyah holding a house party at Kim's house while she was away.\n\nAfter the death of the Notorious B.I.G. in 1997, the crew became defunct. In an interview with the Notorious B.I.G., which was conducted in 1995 but appeared in a 2003 issue of \"XXL Magazine\", he claimed he was planning to retire from rap music in the year 2000 to manage the careers of Junior M.A.F.I.A. In 2005, three of the previous seven members of the group, Lil' Cease, MC Klepto and Larceny (now known as Banger), released an album, \"Riot Musik\", under the Junior M.A.F.I.A. name. The album did not match their previous success, only making it to #61 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart and #50 on the Top Independent albums chart. On March 26, 2007, the trio released another album, \"Die Anyway\", but it did not appear on any album charts.\n\nLil' Kim released four albums as a solo artist. The M.A.F.I.A. were referenced on her debut album, \"Hard Core\", on the song \"M.A.F.I.A. Land\" and featured on \"Fuck You\". Kim collaborated with Lil' Cease on her single \"Crush On You (Remix)\" and on the track \"Big Momma Thang\", from her debut album, also featuring Jay-Z. Lil' Cease's solo effort \"The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo\" was released in 1999 peaked at #26 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The lead single, \"Play Around\", featured Bristal, Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy and peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart. Some of the members of the group went on to other professions. Such a MC Klepto (real name Terrence Harding) is now well known real estate broker, first working for Shark Tank celebrity investor Barbara Corcoran company Corcoran Group \n\nIn 2004, The Best of Junior M.A.F.I.A (Cleopatra) was released, as well as a DVD directed by documentary filmmaker, April Maiya, titled \"Chronicles of Junior M.A.F.I.A\"; a candid documentary dealing with the controversy and conspiracies surrounding The Notorious B.I.G and the Junior M.A.F.I.A. It included unreleased footage of studio sessions and home videos of life with the Notorious B.I.G. and his crew. The DVD release included a free mixtape. A follow-up DVD without the original director was titled \"The Chronicles of Junior M.A.F.I.A. Part II: Reloaded\" was scheduled to be released in 2005, but was halted when Lil' Kim filed a $6 million lawsuit against Lil' Cease, claiming she never granted permission for her name and image to be used.\n\nLil' Cease and Banger (formerly known as Larceny) testified against Lil' Kim during a perjury trial in 2005, which resulted in Kim and the group's manager, D-Roc, being sent to jail. Following the case, Kim labeled the pair \"snitches\" on her 2005 album \"The Naked Truth\". On June 27, 2006 a second DVD was released that was not as successful as its predecessor, entitled \"Reality Check: Junior Mafia vs Lil' Kim.\" The DVD featured the pair explaining their side of the story on the case.\n\nIn 2007, \"Chronicles of Junior MAFIA\" Director, April Maiya, teamed with D-Roc for a follow-up tell-all documentary titled \"Life After Death: The Movie.\" The film vindicated Lil' Kim's convicted perjury and exposed facts behind Lil Cease and Banger being labeled as \"snitches\" in the perjury trial and Hot 97 shootout and corrected the shortcomings in the original 2004 release.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216361", "title": "Land sailing", "text": "Land sailing\n\nLand sailing, also known as 'sand yachting', 'land yachting' or 'dirtboating', is the act of moving across land in a wheeled vehicle powered by wind through the use of a sail. The term comes from analogy with (water) sailing. Historically, land sailing was used as a mode of transportation or recreation. Since the 1950s, it has evolved primarily into a racing sport.\n\nVehicles used in sailing are known as sail wagons, sand yachts, or land yachts. They typically have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or hand levers. Land sailing works best in windy flat areas, and races often happen on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions. Modern land sailors, generally known as \"pilots\", can go three to four times faster than the wind speed. A gust of wind is considered more beneficial in a land sailing race than a favorable windshift. A similar sport, known as ice yachting, is practiced on frozen lakes and rivers. Another variation is the Whike, which combines land sailing with bicycling and can therefore also be used in everyday traffic because it does not fully depend on wind.\n\nThe earliest text describing the Chinese use of mounting masts and sails on large vehicles is the \"Book of the Golden Hall Master\" written by the Daoist scholar and crown prince Xiao Yi, who later became Emperor Yuan of Liang (r. 552–554 AD). He wrote that Gaocang Wushu invented a \"wind-driven carriage\" which was able to carry thirty people at once. There was another built in about 610 for the Emperor Yang of Sui (r. 604–617), as described in the \"Continuation of the New Discourses on the Talk of the Times\".\n\nEuropean travelers from the 16th century onwards mentioned sailing carriages with surprise. In 1585 (during the Chinese Ming Dynasty), Gonzales de Mendoza wrote that the Chinese had many coaches and wagons mounted with sails, and even depicted them in artwork of silk hanfu robes and on earthenware vessels. In the 1584 atlas \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" written by the cartographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598), there are large Chinese carriages depicted with sails and masts. Likewise, there are the same Chinese vehicles with sails depicted in the \"Atlas\" of Gerardus Mercator (1512–1594), as well as the 1626 book \"Kingdome of China\" by John Speed. The English poet John Milton (1608–1674) popularized the Chinese sailing carriage in Europe with a poem written in 1665.\n\nIn the 19th century, \"windwagons\" were occasionally used for transport across the American great plains. Rail-running sail cars were also used in South America. One such sailcar existed on the Dona Teresa Cristina Railroad in Santa Catarina, Brazil in the 1870's.\n\nThe precursor to the modern land yacht was invented in the summer of the year 1600 by the Flemish scientist Simon Stevin in Flanders as a commission for Prince Maurice of Orange. It was used by Prince Maurice for entertaining his guests. In 1898, the Dumont brothers of De Panne, Belgium, developed a land yacht whose sails were based on contemporary Egyptian sailboats used on the Nile River. Louis Bleriot, the French aviation pioneer was instrumental in developing landsailing as a sport. It was viewed as an alternative sport when strong winds would have made flying in early aircraft too dangerous. Bleriot's landsailers were first tried on the Buc airstrip (SW of Paris). Bleriot machines gave their best on Channel and North Sea wide and windy beaches at low tide (Calais, Hardelot, La Panne, Quend, Audresselles etc.). The Blériot firm coined the name \"aéroplage\" (plage is the French for beach) and even registered it as a trademark. The first races were held on the beaches of Belgium and France in 1909. Land yachts were also used in the late 19th century and early 20th century to transport goods on dry lakes in America.\n\nThe modern land yacht, a three-wheeled polyester/fibreglass and metal cart, often with a wing-mast and relatively rigid (full-batten) sails, has been used since 1960.\n\nIn 1967 a French Foreign Legion officer organized a land yacht race across the Sahara Desert. Teams from 7 countries assembled at Colomb-Béchar in Algeria and using French-designed and built machines for the most part, sailed through Algeria, Spanish Morocco and into the capital of Mauritania. Due to the harsh conditions, the idea of racing was abandoned, though at the time three young American boatbuilders, Larry Pardey, Richard Arthur and Warren Zeibarth (Captain, Pardey), were leading the race, with scores double those of any other team. The story made the cover of \"National Geographic\" in November 1967. A reenactment of this event took place three years later and was filmed by \"National Geographic\".\n\nIn 2012, NASA scientist Geoffrey A. Landis proposed that a sail could be used for propulsion of a rover on Venus or other planets (NASA image here). According to \"Popular Mechanics,\" it is \"an ambitious proposal […] to develop a rover that works with Venus's topography and winds.\n\nIn 2017, Landis's work was the subject of the book \"Land-Sailing Venus Rover With NASA Inventor Geoffrey Landis\", published by World Book publishing.\n\nThe world land speed record for a wind-powered vehicle was broken on 26 March 2009 by Briton Richard Jenkins in his yacht Greenbird with a speed of 126.1 mph (202.9 km/h). Wind speeds were fluctuating between at that time.\n\nThe previous record of was set by American Bob Schumacher on March 20, 1999 driving his \"Iron Duck\" vehicle. Both records were set on Ivanpah Dry Lake near Primm, Nevada, United States.\n\nA previous attempt at the record by Britons Dale Vince and Richard Jenkins at Lake Lefroy in Western Australia in their carbon-neutral vehicle, Greenbird, failed on 12 September 2008.\n\nThe International governing body for the sport of land and Sandyachting was formed in 1962 . The Federation International de Sand et Land Yachting ( FISLY ) has member countries from around the world and has divided the sporting side of the activity into various classes. There are a number of basic types, or \"classes\", of land yachts. Because of the very different nature of each class, they compete separately in races. The largest class of yachts are known as Class 2, which may have masts as large as . The massive sail area provides significant power, although the speed of Class 2 yachts can sometimes be limited by their large size these are sailed mainly in continental Europe and USA.\nThe Class 3 is probably the most popular of the large yacht designs, almost identical to the Class 2 in appearance, but significantly smaller. Class 3 yachts are generally made from fiberglass, sometimes in combination with other high-tech lightweight materials, such as carbon fibre, Kevlar, or various composites, with a wooden rear axle. They are capable of reaching speeds up to .\n\nThe Class 5 is much smaller style of yacht than the 2 and 3, and is in a very different shape. The pilot still sails the yacht lying down, but unlike the 2 and 3, he lies in a seat that is suspended from or cantilevered off the chassis, rather than inside the body. The chassis is usually made of steel and aluminium, with a fibreglass or carbon–Kevlar seat. Class 5 yachts are capable of reaching speeds up to , and some have been faster, closer to .\n\nWhile Class 2, 3, and 5 yachts must meet certain strict guidelines, the specifications are flexible to an extent That allows individualism and development.\n\nThe \"Standart\" Class is unique in that it is the only recognised international monotype sand yacht with all yachts being identical. Not dissimilar to Class 5 in shape and function, they must follow a special design supplied by the French manufacturer Seagull. This class is widely popular because it means the outcome of a competition rests entirely with the pilot, as the yacht itself cannot provide an advantage or disadvantage.\n\nClass 7 yachts are built like skateboards with a sail, much like a land-borne windsurfing board. These are also called Speed Sail (A registered trademark by Norbert Blanc, a French inventor who made successful adaptation of a windsurfer sail on an enlarged skateboard, with special wheels and improved axles, in the wake of the 1980' windsurfing craze) and are fully recognised by FISLY as part of sand yacht clubs, they are also sailed for fun and hobby.\n\nClass 8 Land Yachts : kite buggying or parakarting, differ from other classes in that the sail is replaced with a large traction kite, usually flown on 20–40 m quad lines. The buggies are also considerably smaller and more maneuverable. This relatively new class of the sport is still undergoing rapid development but has become popular in recent years due to its portability, relative low cost and flexibility. Kite buggying also uniquely offers the pilot the possibility of getting real air time as buggies are sometimes launched into the air by the traction kite. Class 8 activities are generally grouped under\n\n\"Miniyachts\" are small land yachts which are aimed at the leisure market, however, any type of land yacht can be raced and the identical nature of these yachts make them ideal fun racers due to their similar size and sail area. This style of yacht uses a traditional style land yacht rig with a smaller chassis and body where the pilot is able to sit in a conventional way and control the sail with a simple main sheet. These are the smallest, cheapest and lightest yachts available and are tremendously safe and easy to sail with basic instruction. Miniyachts popularity is increasing rapidly and they are now being built by enthusiasts around the world.\n\nThe basic definition of a miniyacht is \"Any assembled land or sand yacht that fits inside a continuous loop of rope 5.6 m long is a miniyacht\". Some designs of mini yachts can be dismantled and carried in the trunk of a car. They can be sailed equally well by small children and large adults and have the added advantage of going on grass as well as sand or concrete. These yachts are very usable and they are a truly fun inexpensive class for all the family popular in Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Ireland.\n\nThere are also a range of small miniyachts able to be packed into a case and carried in a car or as luggage on a plane. The New Zealand Blokart, UK X-sails, Potty, windbob and Spanish designs like Rinox and WinDreamer together with French and German miniyachts like those from the manufacturers Libre, Airtrack, Plume and Seagull all fall into this category and are small, fast and manoeuvrable and therefore able to be sailed in small urban areas. The hand steering versions allow disabled people to be able to use them and compete with able-bodied competitors.\n\n\nOne of the largest international events in the sport are the European championships, in which competitors of all classes from all over Europe travel to a sand yachting venue for a week-long competition. The Wirral Sand Yacht Club, on Hoylake beach, hosted the event in September 2007. Rada Tilly hosted the World Championship XI in February 2008, an event that was first developed in Argentina and in South America.\n. St Peter Ording was the venue for the 2009 European Championships.\nDe Panne in Belgium hosted the 2010 World Championships. The 2011 European Championships were held in Hoylake on the Wirral peninsula near Liverpool. \nAttendees included local politicians Esther McVey and Stephen Hesford, alongside the Mayor of Wirral, the Head of the International Governing body for Sandyachting, and at least some of the 150 competitors from Argentina, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden Italy, Ireland, Chile, Denmark, USA, Australia and the UK. 2012 saw the World Championships being held in Cherreuix, Brittany France in a beautiful area just in the shadow of the world heritage site Mont Saint Michel. The event catered for all FISLY classes and 350 competitors family and friends participated over the 8 Days. 2013 Europeans were held in St Peter Ording Germany.\n\nIn July 2014 the FISLY Landyachting World Championships were organised by the North American Land Sailing Associations (NALSA) and itss President Dennis Bassano on the remote dry lake of Smith Creek in Central Nevada. Over 400 people from 16 countries spent a week based on the remote lake bed at 6300 ft where many of the \"legends\" of the sport including the current world speed record holder Richard Jenkins had gathered. Double Olympic Gold medal sailor Shirley Robertson participated in the Championship accompanied by a film crew from the CNN Mainsail programme who produced a TV record of the event.\n\nAfter devoting 10 years to the project, British engineer Richard Jenkins broke the land speed record for a wind-powered craft. Jenkins's vehicle, the Ecotricity Greenbird, clocked in at 126.1 mph on March 26, 2009. This was done just south of Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nIn the US, annual competitions are held by local clubs and by NALSA, the North American Landsailing Association. The largest regatta is regularly held the last week of March on the playa at the California-Nevada border near Primm, Nevada. The classes sailed in the US include several one-design classes, international class 5 (5 m² class in the US), and open classes solely based on the sail/wing area. The European yachts sail with the appropriate US open class according to their sail area.\n\nPromoting international competition, there are periodic regattas including FISLY and other landsailing nations, mostly on the Pacific Rim. The host and venue of this regatta rotates, and the 2009 event will be hosted by NALSA at the March regatta.\n\nA history of sailing in the US can be found at Nalsa.org.\n\nBlokart sailing is coordinated by the North American Blokart Sailing Association.\n\nBlokart racing is a sport administered by the International Blokart Racing Association (IBRA) who sanction events and set the international racing rules.\nBlokart World Championships have been held biennially since the inaugural event at the home of Blokart in Papamoa, NZ in 2008. The Blokart Worlds event has been since held in Ostend, Belgium; Ivanpah, California, USA and Perth Australia. In 2018 the Worlds event was held in Binissalem, Mallorca, Spain.\n\nBlokart racing is held on purpose built tracks, airport runways, parking areas as well as beaches and dry lake beds.\nBlokart race events are held around the world, with major events such as New Zealand Open, European Open, British Open, Australian Open, and the North American Open held annually.\n\nBlokarts are raced in two classes – production and performance, and in various weight divisions. The production class is based on the basic blokart design. In the performance class additional parts from the manufacturer are allowed such as carbon fibre mast sections and an aerodynamic shell, adjustable downhaul and modification of the sail battens to alter the shape of the sail. Blokarts have four standard sail sizes, 2.0m, 3.0m, 4.0m and 5.5m, with sail size choice being dependent on wind strength and weight of the sailor, with heavier sailors requiring larger sails, and smaller sails being more efficient in stronger winds.\n\n\n\n\nMini Class Land Yacht plans and construction notes ... \nhttp://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Land-Yacht-Sailing/Construction/Build-a-Landyacht-Lake-Lefroy-Mini-Yacht/\n\n"}

The publisher's name was derived from Prometheus, the Titan from Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to man. This act is often used as a metaphor for bringing knowledge or enlightenment.\n\nPrometheus Books publishes a range of books, focusing on topics such as science, freethought, secularism, humanism, and skepticism. It has published in the \"atheism\" category since its founding in 1969, and is considered the \"grandfather\" of atheist publishing in America.\n\nTheir headquarters was located in Amherst, New York, and they publish worldwide. Jonathan Kurtz is president of Prometheus.\n\nThe publisher has roughly 1,700 books currently in print and publishes approximately 95–100 books per year. Since its founding, Prometheus Books has published more than 2,500 books.\n\nPrometheus Books obtained the bulk of the books and manuscripts of Humanities Press International in 1998. It has been building and expanding this into a scholarly imprint named Humanity Books. This imprint publishes academic works across a wide spectrum of the humanities and is now distributed by the academic division of Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nIn March 2005, Prometheus Books launched the science fiction and fantasy imprint Pyr. In October 2012 it launched the crime fiction imprint Seventh Street Books. In 2018, it sold both imprints.\n\nPrometheus has been involved in two \"major libel lawsuits.\" In 1992 Uri Geller sued Victor J. Stenger and Prometheus Books for libel over his book \"Physics and Psychics\". The suit was dismissed and Geller was required to pay more than $20,000 in costs to the defendant. Geller also sued Prometheus for publishing \"The Truth About Uri Geller\" by James Randi, a book that he claimed was defamatory.\n\nSome notable authors and books published by Prometheus include:\n\nSteve Allen\n\n\nMolefi Asante\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\n\nJeremy Bentham\n\nRob Boston\n\n\nLudwig Feuerbach\n\nAntony Flew\n\nR.

Harris chair in the economics department. He hosts the economics blog \"Marginal Revolution\", together with co-author Alex Tabarrok. Cowen and Tabarrok also maintain the website \"Marginal Revolution University\", a venture in online education.\n\nCowen writes the \"Economic Scene\" column for \"The New York Times\" and since July 2016 has been a regular opinion columnist at \"Bloomberg Opinion\". He also writes for such publications as \"The New Republic\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Forbes\", \"Newsweek\" and the \"Wilson Quarterly\". He serves as general director of George Mason's Mercatus Center, a university research center that focuses on the market economy. In September, 2018, Tyler and his team at George Mason University launched Emergent Ventures, a grant and fellowship focused on \"moon-shot\" ideas. \n\nHe was ranked at number 72 among the \"Top 100 Global Thinkers\" in 2011 by \"Foreign Policy Magazine\" \"for finding markets in everything\". In a 2011 poll of experts by \"The Economist\", Cowen was included in the top 36 nominations of \"which economists were most influential over the past decade\".\n\nCowen was raised in Hillsdale, New Jersey. At 15, he became the youngest ever New Jersey state chess champion. Cowen is of Irish ancestry.\n\nHe graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor of science degree in economics in 1983 and received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1987 with his thesis titled \"Essays in the theory of welfare economics\". At Harvard, he was mentored by game theorist Thomas Schelling, the 2005 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. He is married to Natasha Cowen (née Miskinyants), a lawyer.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" has described Cowen as \"a man who can talk about Haitian voodoo flags, Iranian cinema, Hong Kong cuisine, Abstract Expressionism, Zairian music and Mexican folk art with seemingly equal facility\". One of Cowen's primary research interests is the economics of culture. He has written books on fame (\"What Price Fame?\"), art (\"In Praise of Commercial Culture\") and cultural trade (\"Creative Destruction: How Globalization Is Changing the World's Cultures\"). In \"Markets and Cultural Voices\", he relays how globalization is changing the world of three Mexican amate painters. Cowen argues that free markets change culture for the better, allowing them to evolve into something more people want. Other books include \"Public Goods and Market Failures\", \"The Theory of Market Failure\", \"Explorations in the New Monetary Economics\", \"Risk and Business Cycles\", \"Economic Welfare\" and \"New Theories of Market Failure\".\n\n\nCowen's \"New York Times\" columns cover a wide range of issues such as the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHis dining guide for the D.C. area, \"Tyler Cowen's Ethnic Dining Guide\", was reprinted in the Food section of \"The Washington Post\".\n\nCowen has written papers on political philosophy and ethics. He co-wrote a paper with philosopher Derek Parfit arguing against the social discount rate. In a 2006 paper, he argued that the epistemic problem fails to refute consequentialist forms of argument.\n\nCowen has been described as a \"libertarian bargainer\" who can influence practical policy making, yet he endorsed bank bailouts in his March 2, 2009 column in \"The New York Times\". In a 2007 article entitled \"The Paradox of Libertarianism\", Cowen argued that libertarians \"should embrace a world with growing wealth, growing positive liberty, and yes, growing government. We don't have to favor the growth in government \"per se\", but we do need to recognize that sometimes it is a package deal\".\n\nIn 2012, David Brooks called Cowen \"one of the most influential bloggers on the right\", writing that he is among those who \"start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way\".\n\nIn an August 2014 blog post, Cowen wrote: \"Just to summarize, I generally favor much more immigration but not open borders, I am a liberal on most but not all social issues, and I am market-oriented on economic issues. On most current foreign policy issues I am genuinely agnostic as to what exactly we should do but skeptical that we are doing the right thing at the moment. I don't like voting for either party or for third parties\".\n\nCowen has described himself as a liberal on most social issues and supports same-sex marriage. After the Supreme Court issued its holding regarding same-sex marriage, Cowen said that \"this is exciting and very positive news. Most of all, it is a breakthrough for those people who can now marry, or exercise the choice not to marry\".\n\nCowen is a teetotaler, stating he is \"with the Mormons\" on alcohol, later stating: \"I encourage people to just completely, voluntarily abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm\".\n\nFellow economists have criticized Cowen's pro-free market views. In his January 23, 2009 blog titled \"Dumping on Robert Barro\", Cowen challenged those who were advocating at the time more stimulus for the American economy to show him evidence that stimulus works. In response, economist Bill Mitchell pointed out \"the Post World War II period up until the mid-1970s\".\n\nAccording to William K. Black, associate professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and former bank regulator, Cowen \"assumes that productivity determines personal wealth and is measured by wealth\", but in reality Cowen's \"meritocratic vanguard caused the greatest loss of wealth to society\" while \"so many financial CEOs not only destroyed societal wealth, but also became wealthy through accounting control fraud\". Black also pointed out that Cowen along with what he calls \"theoclassical economists\" through their ideas have \"created such a criminogenic environment that control fraud is frequently the optimal strategy for maximizing the CEOs' self-interest\". In another column, Black challenged Cowen's \"assumption that unrestrained self-interested actions produce a hyper-meritocracy that improves life\", stating instead that \"unrestrained self-interested actions are the primary threat to humanity\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Dominique Swain, Joan Rivers, Peggy Lipton, Paulina Porizkova and Kathy Griffin. The film features multiple cameo appearances including Tommy Hilfiger, Kenneth Cole, Diane von Fürstenberg, Kevyn Aucoin, André Leon Talley, Samia Shoaib, and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe plot centers around Jocelyn Bennett (Swain), an intern at the fictional New York City magazine, \"Skirt\". Horribly mistreated, overworked, and underpaid, Jocelyn lives for \"Skirt,\" especially the photo spreads. However, a spy begins to hand over \"Skirt\"s spreads and story ideas to its rival glossy, \"Vogue\". \"Skirt\" magazine finds itself in a bind and some people begin speculating who the infiltrator (everyone refers to the spy as a yuri) might be. After some fingers begin to point at Jocelyn, she seeks to apprehend the spy and clear her name. Along the way, she meets Paul Rochester (Ben Pullen), the British deputy art director at \"Skirt\", with whom she has much in common. When she finds herself falling in love, one thing stands in her way: Paul's supermodel girlfriend, Resin (Leilani Bishop). Jocelyn continues to search for the spy but several obstacles stand in her way including Art Director Sebastian Niedarfarb (Billy Porter) who believes she is the spy and consistently puts Jocelyn down. However, as she begins to climb the ranks, she begins to stand out to the editors who realize her potential, though they quickly forget it. To make Paul jealous, she starts dating a photo shoot tech named Alex, though the relationship doesn't last. Jocelyn later learns that Resin is only dating Paul because he is related to Prince Charles. Soon after, the spy is apprehended. For her work, Jocelyn is made an assistant, on staff, and finally gets better treatment from her colleagues. During a party thrown by \"Skirt,\" Resin dumps Paul for another model, and Paul and Jocelyn get engaged. The film shows the happy couple two years later being shown on a PBS tour done by the newest intern at \"Skirt.\" Jocelyn has been made the senior photo editor at the magazine and Paul accomplished his dream of becoming a famous artist. They are set to be married in a few months.\n\n\nWhile some have praised the dialogue and writing of the film, other's have criticized the film's execution. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said, \"The biggest mystery about Intern is how a film about people who are obsessed with appearances could wind up looking so hopelessly drab and tacky.\" Others have found the film lacking in some aspects but had redeeming qualities. Stephen MacMillan Moser of the \"Austin Chronicle\" said, \"Intern isn't a particularly deep movie, but, to paraphrase Karl Lagerfeld, fashion is not the same thing as feeding the hungry and curing the ill.\" Emanuel Levy of \"Variety\" said, \"The fashion world is ripe with possibilities for a biting satire, but Lange's Sundance Festival entry is pedestrian, offering a disappointingly flat look at the glamour industry.\"\n\n"}

It saw action on both the Western and Eastern Fronts during World War II.\n\nThe corps was raised on 26 July 1943 in Berlin-Lichterfeld, with initial mustering taking place on the \"Truppenübungsplatz\" at Beverloo, in occupied Belgium. SS-\"Obergruppenführer\" Sepp Dietrich, previously the commander of the SS Division Leibstandarte (LSSAH), became the corps' first commander.\n\nIn August 1943, the corps was transferred to Meran in Italy, where it took part in operations to disarm Italian troops. After this, the corps continued its training, being sporadically engaged in anti-partisan operations in northern Italy. By December 1943, the corps was fully formed and deemed ready for action, with its HQ being set up in Brussels in early 1944.\n\nIn April 1944, the corps was moved to Septeuil, to the west of Paris, where it was assigned the SS Division Leibstandarte, SS Division Hitlerjugend, Panzer-Lehr-Division and the SS Division Götz von Berlichingen. The corps was attached to 5th Panzer Army, the Western theatre's armoured reserve.\n\nWith the launch of Operation Overlord, the allied invasion of France on 6 June 1944, the corps was ordered to Falaise. The Hitlerjugend engaged British and Canadian troops to the north of Caen on 8 June. The corps was tasked with holding the area of Caen and saw heavy fighting around the villages of Authie, Buron and the airport at Carpiquet.\n\nAfter the launch of the American Operation Cobra, which destroyed the Panzer Lehr Division, the corps was ordered to take part in Operation Lüttich, the abortive counter-offensive towards Avranches. The corps was caught in the Falaise Pocket, where they fought to maintain a corridor for the trapped German forces, losing all their armour and materiel in the process. After the collapse of the front, the corps retreated to the Franco-German border.\n\nIn early October 1944, the corps was pulled back from the front line for rest and refit in Westfalen. Refitting was complete by early December, and it was ordered to the Ardennes region to join Sepp Dietrich's Sixth SS Panzer Army, in preparation for an offensive codenamed \"Wacht Am Rhein\", and the ensuing Battle of the Bulge. The corps played a major role in the battle with \"Kampfgruppe Peiper\" of the Leibstandarte forming a mobile spearhead. After several weeks heavy fighting with severely limited fuel supplies, and heavy Allied air attacks, the corps was exhausted. The offensive had to be called off. \"Kampfgruppe Peiper\" became infamous during the battle for the murder of U.S. prisoners of war in what became known as the Malmedy massacre. In the wake of the defeat, the corps along with the remainder of Dietrich's Army, was moved to Hungary.\n\nThe corps, composed of LSSAH and Hitlerjugend SS divisions, was instrumental in one of the last successful German offensives, Operation Southwind, eliminating the Sovjet bridgehead west of the Garam in February 1945. The Germans then launched a pincer movement north and south of Lake Balaton as part of Operation Spring Awakening on 6 March 1945. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The attack was spearheaded by the 6th SS Panzer Army and included the corps, made up of elite units such as the LSSAH and Hitlerjugend SS divisions. Dietrich's army made \"good progress\" at first, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of the muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance ground them to a halt. \nOn 16 March, the Soviets forces counterattacked in strength, which forced the entire southern front to retreat towards Vienna. The German forces, including the LSSAH and the Hitlerjugend divisions could not hold Vienna, which fell to the Soviet forces on 13 April. The Germans units then retreated into Hungary. Thereafter, the bulk of the LSSAH surrendered to US forces near Steyr and the SS Division Hitlerjugend surrendered to US troops near the town of Enns, Austria on 8 May 1945.\n\n\n6 June 1944 (Normandy)\n\n16 December 1944 (Battle of the Bulge)\n\n6 March 1945 (Operation Spring Awakening)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216402", "title": "Lubyanka (Moscow Metro)", "text": "Lubyanka (Moscow Metro)\n\nLubyanka () is a station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line of the Moscow Metro, located under Lubyanka Square. The facility, originally called \"Dzerzhinskaya\" () station, opened in 1935 as part of the first stage of the metro.\n\nThe station was originally named Dzerzhinskaya after Dzerzhinsky Square, but it was changed on 5 November 1990 after the square's original name, Lubyanka, was restored. There is still a bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky in the station vestibule.\n\nConstruction work on the station began in December 1933, and the engineers were faced with extremely difficult soil conditions from the outset. The area under Lubyanka square is made of Jurassic clay, beneath which are layers of quicksand and Carboniferous clay. The Metro station was planned to rest on top of the Carboniferous clay, which was thought to be firm enough to support its weight. It was quickly discovered, however, that the clay was much softer than anticipated due to the proximity of an underground channel of the Neglinnaya River and also tended to swell greatly when exposed to air. This meant that the tunnels had to be built one section at a time, very quickly, in order to allow the concrete to set before the pressure exerted by the expanding clay increased to the point where the wooden forms could no longer contain it.\n\nNikolai Ladovsky's initial design had to be significantly modified in order to cope with these problems. In order to minimize the amount of excavation required, the planned full-length central hall was abandoned in favour of a short passage at the end of the station connecting the two platform tubes, similar to many London Underground stations. This simplified the construction of the station while still allowing the planned hall to be built in the future.\n\nEven after the design change, the station's construction was plagued by difficulties. Quicksand from between the two layers of clay began to seep into the construction site almost immediately, and due to the unexpected softness of the Carboniferous clay the station began to slowly sink. Nevertheless, the builders of the station were able to surmount these problems and Lubyanka was opened as planned on May 15, 1935. The heroic efforts of the Metro builders are memorialized in a sculptural composition in the vestibule on Nikolskaya street.\n\nIn 1965 it was revealed that Lubyanka was to become a transfer point to the planned Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line, making it clear that the station would need to be completed. Technology had advanced to the point where the building of the central hall, which had been deemed impossible in the 1930s, could finally be accomplished, though this project still took more than seven years to complete. The first phase of the station's expansion was the construction of a second entrance at the northern end, which was completed in 1968.\n\nThe construction of the northern half of the central hall was simplified by using the new technique of soil freezing, but this could not be used on the southern half. Workers were forced to go back to the original method of quickly building one tunnel segment at a time before the expansion of the clay could crush them. Once the central hall was finished passages to the platforms were blown through using explosives. In 1972 the station was finally reopened.\n\nThe reconstruction of the station was an engineering triumph, but it was much less impressive aesthetically with blocky white marble pylons and white tiled walls replacing the strikingly patterned dark marble used in the old station. Though the old section of the central hall still exists, the overall effect has been lost. The architects of the expansion were Nina Alexandrovna Aleshin and A.F. Strelkov. In 1975, escalators were added in the centre of the platform for the transfer to the new Kuznetsky Most station.\n\nThe station has numerous entrances, but only two vestibules. The original western vestibule is subterranean and its entrance pavilion is built into the ground floor of a building that stands at the start of the Nikolskaya Street on one side and Malyy Cherkassky side street on the other. The distinctive facade, facing the Lubyanka square, with twin arches was designed by architect Iosif Loveyko, to remind the public of the historic Vladimir gates of the Kitay-gorod wall that was demolished a few years prior. In 1957 a subway was built connecting the vestibule and the new Detsky Mir (Children's World) shop, under the Teatralny drive. The original 3 N-type escalators were replaced in 1997 by ET-3M type (21.8 metres/71 ft high), during which the vestibule underwent renovation.\n\nThe second entrance was opened in 1968, due to the landscape and the axis of the station platform to vestibule is done via two escalators and an interim mezzanine station that rotates the passenger traffic by 180 degrees. The large incline from platform to the mezzanine retains the three LT-4 21.4 metre (70 ft) high escalators. The 7 metre (23 ft) high smaller incline to the subterranean vestibule originally had three LP-6I escalators, but as this model proved troublesome after long use, it was prematurely replaced throughout the Metro during the 1990s. Lubyanka's turn came in 1995 and three ET-5Ms now soldier in their place.\n\nBuilding of the vestibule included a reconstruction of the whole square, that feature a long subway under the square's square's eastern and southern perimeter: two entrances on the corner of the FSB headquarters and a service drive along its western facade, two on the corner of FSB's computing centre (Lubyasky drive and Myasnitskaya street), a further two to the small garden before the Polytechnical Museum the containing the Solovetsky Stone memorial (Lubyansky drive and Novaya square) and a final two right in front of the original entrance. From the new subway, a small passageway was added linking the old vestibule underground. It is thus possible to circumvent the whole square underground and walk from one vestibule to the other without descending to the platforms.\n\nIn 2008 the Detsky Mir was closed for reconstruction, and the original building that the entrance was built into was demolished in 2010 and a Kempinski hotel is being erected in its place, though the ground floor and facade are retained. Thus the only way to access the original vestibule is via the mentioned passageway.\n\nThe station serves as a transfer point to Kuznetsky Most, which linked by a passenger tunnel under the station. Access to which is provided by a pair of tandem escalators in the middle of the central hall. Like on the entrance, the original four LP-6I units, in place since 1975, were replaced in 1993 by ET-5M series.\n\nOn 29 March 2010 a bomb was reported to have gone off at the Lubyanka station, on the Sokolnicheskaya (Сокольническая), during rush hour, at 7:56 AM local time. Early reports suggest that 40 people have been killed, 14 of whom were in the second train carriage where the explosion is believed to have taken place.\n\nA second explosion was reported at Park Kultury station\n"}

After the streets were elevated, these spaces fell into disuse, but have become a tourist attraction in recent decades.\n\nAfter the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889\nnew construction was required to be of masonry, and the town’s streets were regraded one to two stories higher. Pioneer Square had originally been built mostly on filled-in tidelands and often flooded. The new street level also kept sewers draining into Elliott Bay from backing up at high tide.\n\nFor the regrade, the streets were lined with concrete walls that formed narrow alleyways between the walls and the buildings on both sides of the street, with a wide \"alley\" where the street was. The naturally steep hillsides were used, and through a series of sluices material was washed into the wide \"alleys,\" raising the streets to the desired new level, generally higher than before, in some places nearly .\n\nAt first, pedestrians climbed ladders to go between street level and the sidewalks in front of the building entrances. Brick archways were constructed next to the road surface, above the submerged sidewalks. Pavement lights (a form of walk-on skylight with small panes of clear glass which later became amethyst-colored) were installed over the gap from the raised street and the building, creating the area now called the Seattle Underground.\nWhen they reconstructed their buildings, merchants and landlords knew that the ground floor would eventually be underground and the next floor up would be the new ground floor, so there is very little decoration on the doors and windows of the original ground floor, but extensive decoration on the new ground floor.\n\nOnce the new sidewalks were complete, building owners moved their businesses to the new ground floor, although merchants carried on business in the lowest floors of buildings that survived the fire, and pedestrians continued to use the underground sidewalks lit by the pavement lights (still seen on some streets) embedded in the grade-level sidewalk above.\n\nIn 1907, the city condemned the Underground for fear of bubonic plague, two years before the 1909 World Fair in Seattle (Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition).

{"id": "2216434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216434", "title": "FK Pelister", "text": "FK Pelister\n\nFK Pelister () is a Macedonian football club based in the city of Bitola, North Macedonia. They are currently competing in the Macedonian Second League (West Division).\n\nFK Pelister, was formed in 1945. In 1946 they won the Bitola regional title and that same year they merged with Rabotnik. They won the Bitola title in 1950 and 1951 again. During that time the most influential players were: Georgievski, Dimitrovski, Petrovski, Naumovski, Lazarevski, Sekerdžievski, Avramovski, Nestorov and Eftimovski.\n\nThe team played primarily in the lower divisions of the former SFR Yugoslavia and were champions of the Macedonian Republic League four times, along with winning the Macedonian Republic Cup four times in 1959, 1962, 1985 and 1991. They earned promotion to the Yugoslav Second League Group East, which included clubs from Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, for the first time in 1974, which was a big success for that generation. Some of the most famous players at the time were: Grbevski, Dukovski, Cvetkovski, Taškov, Bogoevski, Gočevski, Ristevski, Tristovski, Mickovski, Dimovski, Markovski, Upalevski and the manager Stavre Eftimovski. Soon after, they were relegated but made another comeback in 1982 with Mitko Butlevski as chairman and Ivan Čabrinović as manager. The biggest success came in the 1990–91 Yugoslav Cup when they reached the 1/8 final, getting eliminated on away goals by the eventual champions Hajduk Split. Pelister played their final season in the Yugoslav league system in the 1991–92 Yugoslav First League finishing in 15th place.\n\nFollowing the formation of the First Macedonian Football League, Pelister had early success consistently finishing in the Top 5. They also made it to the Macedonian Cup final the first two seasons coming up short both times. The club became rivals with Vardar Skopje which created the Eternal derby of Macedonia and continued the Pelagonia regional derby with Pobeda Prilep. In 2000, Pelister became the first team in independent Macedonia to reach the third phase of a European competition. They made it to round three of the 2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup, losing 1–5 on aggregate to one of the winners Celta de Vigo. Finally, the club earned its first major trophy in 2001 by winning the 2000–01 Macedonian Cup, after which they played in the UEFA Cup. In 2003, the team fell on hard times caused by financial problems and was relegated. A few years later, former players Mitko Stojkovski and Toni Micevski were able to save the club from collapse. After taking over the club they brought instant success with the team winning the 2005–06 Macedonian Second League title. The following year they made a successful comeback to the Macedonian First League and got to the 2006–07 Macedonian Cup semifinal. In the 2007–08 season, the club had its best season to date finishing in 3rd place. Once again, they played in the UEFA Cup where they lost 0–1 on aggregate to APOEL. Another case of financial difficulties and poor results, once again relegated them back to second division for the 2011–12 season. This time, however, relying mostly on young players from Bitola and led by captain Dragan Dimitrovski, Pelister made an immediate return to the top division, but after the 2014–15 season, the club was once again relegated. This time it happened under the managerial leadership of Gjoko Hadžievski and new owner Cermat, represented by Zoran Ristevski. Under the ownership of Cermat and municipality of Bitola, after being relegated the team has continued to languish in the second division. But, after a following season, the club was again immediately returned to the First League, despite the relegation battle in one time. In the following season, the club was won the 2016–17 Macedonian Cup for the second time, first time since 2001 and thus was played in the Europa League which was a first participation in the European competitions since 2008. But unfortunately its not an end of the turbulent period for the Bitola club, in which they threaten a relegation for the fourth time, after a two seasons in First League, the problems is more deeper because a players and the board were leaving the club, and a facing a financial trouble. Pelister was relegated at the end of the season, although were playing the another final of the 2017–18 Macedonian Cup.\n\nThe club focuses heavily on youth players from the Bitola region with a strong talent development. Gjorgji Hristov, Dragi Kanatlarovski, Toni Micevski, Nikolče Noveski, Toni Savevski and Mitko Stojkovski are some of the famous Bitola natives to start their careers with the club. Therefore, Pelister is known as the nursery of young and talented players who have left and gone to have success on various clubs in Macedonia and abroad.\n\nThe club colours have traditionally been green and white. The crest is formed in a shape of a shield, at the top left corner it has always had the number 1945 inscribed, which is the year of the club's foundation. In the latest version it includes the Cyrillic letters FK, on the right side. Shape of a mountain forms in the backdrop (to honor the mountain peak Pelister) with the name of the club in the center and a classic leather football underneath it. Early versions of the crest included the colour black, but now the entire badge uses only two colours, green and white.\n\nPrior to the 2016 season, Australian club Pascoe Vale FC (Formerly Pascoe Vale Pelister) announced they would adopt a new logo, inspired by that of FK Pelister, to tie back to their original namesake and immigrant origins.\n\nČkembari () are an Ultras group, established in 1985, who support the Macedonian sports clubs from Bitola that compete under the \"Pelister\" banner, mainly FK Pelister in football and RK Pelister in handball. The group was founded in 1985 when a caravan of 15 buses traveled to support RK Pelister who was playing against Partizan Bjelovar in a handball relegation play-off match. At that time they used the name BMČM – Bitolčani, Motorcyclists, Čkembari, Macedonians () later shortened to just Čkembari. Soon after, the first green and white banners were created that read: „Hell Boys“ () and „Green Conquerors“ () which started organized support for Pelister at every match. There is also a Greek contingent of supporters from living in Bitola and some of its surrounding villages that follow Pelister, referring to is as \"Peristeri\",() the old Greek name for the Pelister area.\n\nThe club's main rival is FK Vardar from Skopje; their matches are called the Eternal derby of Macedonia. Other significant rivals are FK Pobeda (Pelagonia derby), FK Rabotnički (one of the Skopje-Bitola rivalries); and other clubs with an Albanian background (mainly FK Shkëndija and FK Shkupi).\n\n Macedonian Republic League:\n\n\n\n\n\"As of 4 June 2013, Source: http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html\"\n\n\n\"As of 5 February 2020\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216435", "title": "Hough riots", "text": "Hough riots\n\nThe Hough riots were riots in the predominantly African-American community of Hough (pronounced \"Huff\") in Cleveland, Ohio, which took place from July 18 to 23, 1966. During the riots, four African Americans were killed and 50 people were injured. There were 275 arrests and numerous incidents of arson and firebombings. City officials at first blamed black nationalist and communist organizations for the riots, but historians generally dismiss these claims today, arguing that the cause of the Hough Riots were primarily poverty and racism. The riots caused rapid population loss and economic decline in the area, which lasted at least five decades after the riots.\n\nDuring the 1950s, middle-class whites largely left the neighborhood of Hough in Cleveland, Ohio, and working-class African Americans moved in. By 1966, more than 66,000 people, nearly 90 percent of them African American, lived in Hough. Most businesses in the area remained white-owned, however. Residents of the Hough neighborhood complained extensively of inferior and racially segregated public schools, poor delivery of welfare benefits, a lack of routine garbage collection, no street cleaning, and too few housing inspections. Recreational facilities in Hough were nonexistent except for minimal equipment at a few school playgrounds. Hough was a relatively small area, but the population density in the neighborhood was one of the highest in Cleveland. Housing was often substandard in Hough, with a fifth of all housing units considered dilapidated and absentee landlords (most of them white) were common. The deindustrialization of Cleveland hit the African American community hard, and unemployment was over 17 percent. Median income for black residents was just 65 percent the median income of whites. Although Hough contained just 7.3 percent of Cleveland's population, it had more than 19 percent of its welfare cases. Single mothers (half of them teenagers) bore one-third of the children in Hough in 1966, and infant mortality was twice as high as the rest of the city. High unemployment and the rapid deterioration of the neighborhood created extensive racial tension in Hough. Although the city had engaged in some urban renewal housing projects in Hough, these had displaced more people than they housed and those displaced had received little to no help in finding new housing. Moreover, failed urban renewal to the east of Hough had displaced several thousand poor families, most of whom moved into Hough.\n\nA racially segregated Cleveland Division of Police also led to interracial tension in the city. Twenty percent of Cleveland's major crimes were committed in Hough, even though it had just 7 percent of the city's population. Only 165 of Cleveland's 2,100 police officers were African American, the city routinely declined to promote black patrolmen, and the police had a reputation for exhibiting \"crude racism\" and ignoring the needs of the black community. The police were perceived as unwilling to enforce the law and slow to respond in black communities, and police harassment of African Americans was the norm. Subsequently, African Americans in Cleveland tended to strongly distrust the police. There had also been several incidents of brutality committed by the police in Cleveland in the last few years, which worsened the tension between the police and the city's African American citizens.\n\nIn 1963 and 1964, the United Freedom Movement, a coalition of African American civil rights groups, led a nine-month protest campaign against poor-quality, racially segregated schools and racial discrimination against blacks by labor unions. Cleveland Mayor Ralph S. Locher, who was white, dismissed these concerns. This was not unusual: The political culture of Cleveland had long been dominated by the mayor, city council, big business, the larger newspapers, and a few powerful white ethnicities. The city had a long history of ignoring social ills, while favoring low taxes and small government. African American protests in the past had been small and died out swiftly, and progress (what little there was of it) was generally achieved through traditional behind-the-scenes deal-making. The school protests were Cleveland's first large, lengthy racial protests, and the failure to achieve significant progress taught the black community that negotiation and legal action produced only limited results. Although 10 of the city council's 22 members were African American, black council members were seen as too conservative and out of touch with the vast majority of Cleveland's African Americans.\n\nThroughout the first half of 1966, there had been a large number of incidents (such as roving gangs of youth, and rock throwing) indicating unrest in the neighborhood. In April 1966, the United States Commission on Civil Rights held hearings in Cleveland, during which time it gathered extensive evidence about employment discrimination, police brutality, poor housing, ongoing school segregation, and racism in the community. Televised locally, \"the hearings revealed that the city's racial powder keg was about to explode\".\n\nThe Seventy-Niner's Café was a white-owned bar located on the southeast corner of E. 79th Street and Hough Avenue, and popular with African American residents of the community. Seventy-Niner's suffered from a number of problems, including drug dealing, the sale of stolen goods, and prostitution, and the owners had begun barring certain individuals from the establishment. Local prostitutes Margaret Sullivan and her friend, Louise (an African American), were among those who had been banned. Sullivan died on July 16, leaving three young children. On July 17, Louise attempted to leave a box at the bar so patrons could donate money for the care of Sullivan's children. The owners refused to permit the collection. Louise returned about 5 PM on Monday, July 18. The owners argued with her, allegedly using defamatory and racist language, and she was thrown out. A short while later, another racially charged incident occurred, although the exact details are unclear. In one account, one of the bar owners denied water to an African American man who had entered the bar, and then posted a sign on the door which read \"No Water for Niggers\". In another account, an African American man purchased a bottle of liquor in the bar, and then requested a cup of ice. One of the owners denied his request, and then posted a sign on the door which read \"No water for niggers\". In a third account, an African American man entered the bar and asked for a glass of water. One of the owners denied his request and told a waitress that there was \"no water for niggers\". This co-owner then posted a sign on the door which read \"No Ice Water\". In an interview with \"The Plain Dealer\" newspaper, the Feigenbaums denied being present at the bar during the incident, and denied that one of their employees had denied a man water.\n\nAllegedly, the Seventy-Niner's Café was robbed about an hour after the water incident. A crowd of angry African Americans, some bar patrons and some residents, gathered around the bar. The Feigenbaums said they received a report that their establishment had been robbed at about 8 PM, and arrived at the Seventy-Niner at 8:20 PM. They claimed that a crowd of about 300 people had already gathered outside the bar, and began throwing rocks at the windows once the owners had gone inside. Abe Feigenbaum then said he went outside with a .44 caliber Ruger Model 44 rifle in his hands, followed by his brother Dave armed with a pistol. The rock-throwing stopped, they said, but resumed when they went back inside. After four calls to the police for help went unanswered, the Feigenbaums called the fire department in desperation and fled the café. The crowd now attempted to burn down the bar, but the attempt failed. At 9:11 PM, the Cleveland Division of Fire arrived at the Seventy-Niner's Café. Worried fire officials notified the Cleveland police of the large crowd, and the police arrived at 9:30 PM.\n\nAbout 8:30 PM, the crowd—which included youth, adults, and even senior citizens—began to move down Hough Avenue, looting stores and setting fires as it went. Firefighters responding to the Seventy-Niner's Café fire claimed they came under small arms fire. When the first contingent of 75 Cleveland Police finally arrived at 9:30 PM, the crowd began throwing rocks at them.\n\nInitially, about 200 rioters roamed over a 30-square block area centered on Hough Avenue. Police first came under fire shortly before 10 PM at the intersection of E. 75th and Hough Avenue, returning fire and lobbing tear gas grenades onto building roofs to clear out gunmen. The police responded by sending more than 300 additional officers into the area. They fanned out throughout the neighborhood, but came under attack as rioters threw bricks and bottles at them. The police responded by launching tear gas grenades into any crowds they encountered. When fired upon, the police used extremely aggressive tactics to find the snipers, especially on Hough Avenue—where they broke down doors and \"rampaged\" through apartments to try to find and arrest their attackers. Police set up a command post in a van at E. 73rd Street and Hough Avenue, but it took heavy fire from buildings located on E. 73rd and E. 75th Streets. The police were for a time unable to control the situation, and police Captain Richard Sherry called the scene \"sheer bedlam\". Rioters grabbed tear gas grenades and threw them back at the police, hurled Molotov cocktails, and destroyed police vehicles. At one point, police were briefly pinned down by sniper fire at Hough and E. 75th Street. Police sealed off eight blocks around Hough Avenue in an attempt to contain the violence, and a police helicopter was used to direct the police toward suspected gunmen on top of buildings and report incidents of looting. Police initially shot out streetlights, and later were forced to bring in searchlights to illuminate dark streets and alleys, searching for rioters and gunmen.\n\nThe Cleveland Division of Fire responded to the numerous small fires set by the rioters. Shots were fired at them, Molotov cocktails were tossed at them, and a mob of about 100 people seized control of a fire pumper, and the fire department withdrew its personnel from the area. Attacks on firefighters were so numerous, many considered resigning the next day. James Higginbotham, a lieutenant with the fire department, said \"we're not hired to fight a guerrilla war and this is what this is\".\n\nThe rioting largely died down after a heavy thunderstorm struck the area around midnight, and gunfire ended around 1 AM. Joyce Arnett, a 26-year-old African American mother of three, was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman when she leaned out a window. African American man Alton Burks was shot in the hip and African American man Wallace Kelly was shot in the jaw by unidentified gunmen as well. A white man and wife, the Nopwaskis, were hit by rocks while riding a public bus and also suffered minor injuries. Another five civilians were shot (but only lightly injured), and three were injured by rocks or bottles, while 12 policemen were injured (although only slightly). Ten buildings were destroyed by fire, and 53 African Americans—most of them teenagers—were arrested.\n\nDuring the day on July 19, Cleveland Mayor Locher and Police Chief Richard Wagner assured the public that they had the situation under control. Very early in the morning, Locher toured the area and then later conferred with white and black city leaders. Locher initially resisted pleas to send in the Ohio Army National Guard, but Cleveland City Council members John W. Kellogg and Edward F. Katalinas both pressured him to do so. At 3:30 PM, Locher asked Governor James A. Rhodes to send in 1,500 National Guardsmen. Governor Rhodes declared a state of emergency in Cleveland. At 5 PM, Locher announced the arrival of the National Guard was imminent, and ordered all bars and cafes in the Hough neighborhood closed. This marked the first time the Ohio National Guard had been mobilized to counter a racial incident.\n\nMost African American residents of Cleveland believed Locher to be completely out of touch with the black community, and the rioting spread outside the Hough neighborhood on the night of July 19–20. Locher ordered the entire police force on duty for 12 hours, beginning at 7 PM. Violence began to erupt about 8:30 PM, when police arrested two men, a woman, and a child at E. 87th and Hough Avenue. A large crowd gathered and began jeering the police. Snipers on the rooftop of a nearby building exchanged fire with police, and the crowd dispersed. The National Guard, armed with M1 Garand rifles equipped with bayonets, did not arrive until nearly 11 PM. Only 275 Guardsmen made it to Cleveland on the evening of July 19, and 75 of these were stationed at the main point of violence at E. 79th and Hough Avenue, where a Cleveland Police mobile command post was once more established. Guardsmen began patrolling the neighborhood in Jeeps, with a Cleveland Police officer riding with them. In the early morning hours of July 20, more Guardsmen arrived in Cleveland and augmented these patrols. Gunfire directed at police was much less frequent than the night before, but bottle and rock throwing and looting was widespread and extensive. Most of the rioting ended about 1 AM again.\n\nDuring the night, arsonists attacked abandoned houses and commercial buildings, setting 67 fires (small and large). Firefighters were able to respond without being attacked or fired upon. The hardest-hit area was on Hough Avenue between E. 84th and E. 86th, where 11 buildings burned. Another death occurred on July 19 when 36-year-old African American Percy Giles was shot in the back of head by a Cleveland police officer according to witnesses at E. 86th Street and Hough Avenue at about 8:30 PM. Another man, 26-year-old Mallory Richardson, was shot in the leg at E. 31st and Euclid Avenue at about 10 PM, and 39-year-old Paul Richardson was grazed in the arm by gunfire at 10:30 PM while standing outside near his home on E. 79th Street. In all, 60 people were arrested that night. A white male, Joseph Brozich, was assaulted by a small group of African American youth at E. 105th and Superior Avenue and suffered minor cuts and abrasions.\n\nDuring the day on July 20, Mayor Locher spoke to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and asked for the federal government's assistance in rebuilding Hough after the riots. A group of African American clergy asked the President of the United States to declare Hough a disaster area, so that it would qualify for federal disaster relief personnel and funds.\n\nIn separate press conferences, both Locher and Cleveland Safety Director John N. McCormick said that \"outsiders\" were the cause of the riots. McCormick asserted that between 200 and 300 teenagers were being directed by adults, and he blamed black nationalist groups for the riots. Representatives of some of these groups, which were extensively active in Hough, denied encouraging the violence. United States Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach scoffed at McCormick's claims.\n\nA group of local businessmen in the Central neighborhood of Cleveland, citing a few scattered incidents of vandalism, urgently pressed Mayor Locher to expand the National Guard's patrol area to include their neighborhood. Locher agreed, and expanded the patrol zone to (centered on Hough). This expanded the patrol zone as far south as Woodland Avenue, with about 40 Guardsmen and police patrolling the Central neighborhood.\n\nAt dusk, Mayor Locher again ordered all bars in Hough to close.\n\nBy the morning of July 20, 1,700 National Guardsmen were in Cleveland, although only about 1,000 were actually on patrol duty. Rioting had continued during the day, with firebombing and vandalism occurring throughout Hough. Police uncovered a number of caches of Molotov cocktails, which were destroyed. Throughout the day and night, Cleveland firefighters continued to respond to blazes, although they moved in convoys and were protected by National Guardsmen armed with rifles and machine guns. Seven teenagers were arrested during daylight hours, six of them for looting.\n\nExtensive rioting began again in Hough before dark. As night fell, a series of National Guard/police guardposts was established in Hough. When a large crowd gathered at Stephen E. Howell Elementary School (where clergyman Bruce Klunder had died in 1964 protesting against segregation in Cleveland schools), worried law enforcement officials stationed about 100 police and Guardsmen around the school and on its roof to prevent it from being burned down. Military vehicles were stationed at every other intersection along the entire 50-block length of Hough Avenue, and three Guardsmen were posted at every intersection on Hough Avenue between E. 55th and E. 105th Streets. Police and National Guard continued to patrol the riot zone on Jeeps on which .30 caliber machine guns were mounted. A police helicopter (which occasionally drew gunfire) was used to help identify where mobs formed and where extensive looting was occurring. Throughout the night, police and the firefighting personnel were harassed by hundreds of false alarms, which tended to disperse their forces and allow crowds to form and continue the rioting and looting. Police later said that most reports of gunfire were inaccurate, the result of people lighting firecrackers to distract police.\n\nRioting in Hough largely ended around midnight. By dawn on July 21, a total of 24 people had been injured in the Hough Riots. Police made a few more arrests during the night, primarily for looting, bringing the total number of arrestees to 150. Cleveland fire officials said they had responded to between 45 and 50 blazes during the two nights of rioting, which spread into the adjacent Glenville neighborhood, and a total of 10 buildings had been lost.\n\nDuring the day on July 21, Hough was calm, with no incidents of gunfire, vandalism, or arson reported. Nine people arrested during the previous three days of rioting were charged with felonies, the first felony charges to be made during the event.\n\nMany Cleveland-area officials and reporters spent much of July 21 blaming black nationalists and outsiders for fomenting and sustaining the riots. Doris O'Donnell, a reporter with \"The Plain Dealer\", wrote that \"A 'hate whitey' revolution, plotted and predicted for many months\" by \"a small band of extremists\" was the real cause of the riots, and said the riots were implemented \"as if by a diversionary enemy\". She reported that the police, city hall, and unnamed federal agencies had extensive evidence that \"points to certain groups and certain individuals as the suspected plotters\" behind the riots. O'Donnell reported that black activists told her that certain businesses had been told to place a sign in the windows or on their front doors as a \"signal not to fire bomb the place\", and that agitators had worked up lists (one for businesses to be firebombed, one for business to be protected). Quoting unnamed black residents of Hough, she said that unnamed organizations had created a \"ready-made army\", which had drilled for months in use of firearms, burn-and-run tactics, and the manufacture and use of firebombs. O'Donnell placed the blame for the riots on welfare, which encouraged women to have large numbers of illegitimate children and allowed unemployed husbands to \"sponge\" off their welfare-supported wives. Police Chief Wagner declared that he saw a pattern in the making of false alarms which \"indicate there was some form of organization behind them\", and \"The Plain Dealer\" said unnamed police officers believed they saw a pattern in the false reports of arson or gunfire. Cleveland City Council President James V. Stanton said, \"I definitely feel this was organized\", and Bertram E. Gardner, executive director of the Cleveland Community Relations Board, claimed, \"There's a fringe element in the streets, and they're fighting for control of the streets. They've got to be removed.\" Gardner demanded that the police significantly step up the numbers of arrests. Representative Michael A. Feighan, a Democrat who represented Cleveland's west side, said that he had evidence that the rioters \"have had training in firearms and Molotov cocktails\", and pledged to have the House Judiciary Committee hold hearings into the cause of the riots.\n\nAs dusk approached on July 21, police and Guardsmen maintained the expanded patrol zone. About 400 Cleveland police officers patrolled with the Guard, although no police patrolled in the Hough neighborhood itself. Hough was so quiet during the night that only a handful of National Guardsmen were needed there. The National Guard did, however, close Hough Avenue between E. 79th and E. 93rd Streets. Most police patrolled around the perimeter of the expanded patrol zone, where most of the reports of gunfire, vandalism, and arson occurred during the night of July 21. The first indication of trouble occurred at about 7:45 PM, when a large number of small fires were set and false reports of fire were made. The only large fire of the evening occurred when a vacant apartment building just south of E. 79th Street and Hough Avenue burned to the ground. Later in the evening, Cleveland Police shot a mother, three of her young children, and her teenaged nephew near E. 107th Street and Cedar Avenue near the scene of a five-alarm fire. During the attack on the mother's car, a National Guardsman was hit in the leg by a ricocheting police bullet. Later, four policemen were injured when two police vehicles collided at the intersection of E. 105th Street and Chester Avenue. Most of the evening's disturbances were minor, as no widespread rioting occurred. Minor incidents of vandalism were reported, and the National Guard easily dispersed any small groups which formed in the Hough area. Some police officers claimed to have seen two or three cars with out-of-state license plates (each vehicle carrying several African American men), but these were unsubstantiated claims. The only substantiated incident occurred when police found two automobiles full of white youths inside the patrol zone, and ordered them to leave. By dawn on July 22, the Cleveland Fire Department had responded to 115 fires (52 started by firebombs), and just 12 false alarms. One firefighter was allegedly shot at. A total of 30 individuals had been injured during the four nights of rioting. One person was arrested for arson and 11 were arrested for carrying firebombs on the night of July 21–22, bringing the total number of individuals arrested (regardless of charge) to 150.\n\nThe shooting of citizens heightened racial tension in Hough on July 22. Cleveland City Councilman M. Morris Jackson, who represented Hough, had been pressing for the mayor to declare martial law in the area since the riots first began. In a front page editorial on the morning of July 22, \"The Plain Dealer\" also demanded the imposition of martial law. Mayor Locher refused these requests. Mayor Locher also decided not to ask the governor for additional National Guard troops, saying that the riot situation had improved over the past two nights. He also declined to impose a curfew. During the afternoon of July 22, Major General Erwin C. Hostetler, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, issued an order authorizing his troops to shoot looters and arsonists. Chief Wagner continued to claim that black nationalists were fomenting the riot, and specifically named the leaders of the JFK House, a privately run African American community center, for orchestrating the firebombing campaign. When pressed by the media, Wagner declined to say what evidence he had for the accusation. Wagner also claimed that firebombing \"forays emanated\" from JFK House, but declined to elaborate on his claim.\n\nRacial tensions worsened on the night of July 22–23. Initially, the night was quieter than previous nights. The police and National Guard largely deployed toward the edge of the expanded patrol zone. Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed as they put out blazes.\n\nThe first trouble during the night began at 7:20 PM, when a jeering crowd of about 30 individuals gathered at E. 79th and Hough Avenue as the National Guard, bayonets fixed, told an African American man to move his car from the intersection. Another incident occurred at 10:30 PM, when Cleveland police arrested 15 juveniles and three adults in Glenville (on the border with the city of East Cleveland) for harassing a National Guard unit.\n\nThe situation deteriorated at about 3 AM, when 29-year-old African American Benoris Toney was shot in the head in the parking lot of the Dougherty Lumber Co. at 12100 Euclid Avenue. Toney had been traveling on Euclid when, according to police eyewitnesses, another vehicle began to parallel him. Toney pulled into the parking lot, where police had been stationed all night long, and the other vehicle followed him. The men in the second vehicle then shot Toney twice with a shotgun through the open window of Toney's automobile. The assailants' vehicle then sped away. The police gave chase and stopped it, arresting six white adults and teenagers. Another 100 Cleveland police and Guardsmen, as well as a Cleveland police helicopter, rushed to the scene. Police later released four of the suspects, but sought a third man who allegedly fled the vehicle. Toney died on the afternoon of July 23.\n\nShortly after the Toney killing, a crowd of about 125 white people gathered at the foot of Murray Hill in the Little Italy neighborhood on the far eastern border of Cleveland. This was the site of a riot in January 1964, and worried Cleveland police dispersed the crowd as swiftly as they could.\n\nAnother murder occurred at 4 AM, when 54-year-old African American Sam Winchester was shot corner of E. 116th and Regalia Avenue. As he lay dying in an ambulance, he claimed a white male shot at him from an automobile. Cleveland police, however, said they were unsure if Winchester's death was riot-related.\n\nBy dawn on July 23, a total of 10 people had been wounded by gunfire during the Hough Riots, bring to 40 the number of people injured by guns and hand-thrown missiles. Cleveland police made an additional 72 arrests during the night. \"The New York Times\" reported that \"scores\" of small fires had been set throughout the riot patrol zone area, but that only a handful of them had been large blazes. Contradicting the statement of \"The Plain Dealer\", the \"Times\" reported that nearly all fires had been set by firebombs. Hysteria appeared to be driving the public perception of the riots, \"The New York Times\" said. It quoted unnamed National Guard sources who said that law enforcement had received hundreds of calls for help from individuals claiming to be besieged by mobs or firebombers. When the National Guard rushed to the scene, however, they found no arsonists, no crowds, no rioting, and no vandalism.\n\n\"The New York Times\" claimed that the Cleveland Police Department appeared to be contributing to the riot. The National Guard was much more respectful toward citizens than the police, the newspaper claimed, noting that \"police appeared to be adding to the problem by being chronic under-achievers in diplomacy\".\n\nThe night of July 23–24 saw the rioting largely end. No roving gangs were seen in the expanded patrol zone area. The Cleveland Division of Fire responded to about five alarms an hour, and the number of fire alarms in the Hough area was actually below normal for an average night. Cleveland Safety Director McCormick announced on July 24 that he was surprised by the extent to which the rioting had died down overnight. Calm continued Sunday morning, and Cleveland was drenched with heavy rains on the afternoon of July 24 which kept most people indoors.\n\nThe total number of those killed in the riots was four, and the total number of injured was 50.\n\nOn July 26, the first 528 National Guard troops left Hough. The remainder withdrew to camps around the city. Withdrawals continued until the last 800 troops left on July 31.\n\nDuring the event as well as immediately after, some individuals asserted (in what one scholar has called the \"official narrative\") that the Hough Riots had been caused by black nationalists or communists. During the riots, Mayor Richard Locher, Police Chief Richard Wagner, Safety Director John N. McCormick, Cleveland City Council President James V. Stanton, and \"The Plain Dealer\" newspaper all claimed that, while the initial violence on the night of July 23 may have been spontaneous, the riot had long been planned by violent, black nationalist or communist organizations, and had been sustained by them for several days.\n\nThe \"official narrative\" was reinforced when Cleveland law enforcement officials formed a grand jury on July 25 to investigate the causes of the riot. The jury foreman was Louis B. Seltzer, an editor of the \"Cleveland Press\" who had retired early in 1966. On August 9, 1966, the grand jury issued its 17-page report, blaming the riots on black nationalists and communist organizations. The grand jury reported that \"This jury finds that the outbreak of lawlessness and disorder was both organized, precipitated, and exploited by a relatively small group of trained and disciplined professionals of this business. They were aided and abetted willingly or otherwise by misguided people of all ages and colors, many of whom are avowed believers in violence and extremism, and some of whom are either members of, or officers in the Communist Party.\" At a press conference on July 26, Seltzer stated, \"The grand jury saw enough to realize the violence was organized and planned because of specific targets singled out for burning and looting.\" The report strongly praised the Cleveland Police for their courage and restraint during the crisis. Although it issued no indictments, the grand jury specifically named Lewis G. Robinson, director of JFK House and organizer of the Medgar Evers Rifle Club; Harllel Jones, a city sewer department employee; and Albert D. Ware-Bey, a member of several clubs to which Robinson and Jones belonged. Chief Wagner said he was not surprised that no indictments were forthcoming, since Ohio lacked an anti-criminal syndicate law.\n\nIn addition to the focus on black nationalists and communist groups, the report listed a number of social ills which it said was the \"uneasy backdrop\" to the riots. The report also made several recommendations, including stronger enforcement of gambling, liquor, and prostitution laws; more frequent housing code inspections; improved garbage collection; and much greater and swifter efforts at urban renewal. The report also listed too-dense housing, substandard housing, overly high rents, a lack of neighborhood recreational facilities, excessive food prices, substandard educational facilities, a lack of jobs, welfare (which encouraged excessive pregnancies), and common-law marriage (which allowed men to escape their marital and child-rearing duties) as social evils which allowed frustration and bitterness to arise among African Americans. This, in turn (the report said), allowed communist and black nationalist groups to find support and foment riot. The grand jury report pointedly declined to discuss allegations of police brutality.\n\nThe grand jury report also called for new laws defining and providing for harsh penalties for incitement to riot, arson or attempted arson during a riot, and assault against a police officer or firefighter while engaged in official duties. The report also called for the state to redefine \"riot\" under the law, to make it easier for law enforcement to arrest rioters.\n\nThe grand jury report was embraced by city officials and local law enforcement. Mayor Locher praised the grand jury for \"the guts to fix the approximate cause which has been hinted at for a long time, that subversive and Communist elements in our community were behind the rioting.\"\n\nThe \"official narrative\" also received support in other quarters. On June 22, during the riot, five members of a local W.E.B. Du Bois Club—including staff members Steve Shreefter and Mike Bayer—were riding in a car. Stopped by a National Guardsmen, posters were found in their vehicle which \"The Plain Dealer\" characterized as inflammatory. The United States Department of Justice had attempted to have the group declared a Communist front organization in March 1966 under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950. In 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a report characterizing the literature as \"communist\" In 1967, Phillip Abbott Luce, a former member of the Communist Party USA, asserted in his book \"Road to Revolution\" that the Communist Party played a significant role in causing and sustaining the Hough and other riots in the United States in the 1960s.\n\nArguments against the \"official narrative\" fell into two categories. The first was that there was no evidence for any black nationalist or communist involvement in the Hough Riots. For example, Maj. Gen. Erwin C. Hostetler, Ohio National Guard Adjutant General, criticized Seltzer's conclusions, saying, \"There is absolutely nothing to substantiate his statement\".\n\nAnother argument against the \"official narrative\" was that it was willfully blind to the problems which sparked the riots. Carl Stokes and many African American community leaders called the grand jury report a whitewash designed to insulate and absolve the Locher administration. In response to the 1966 grand jury report, leaders from the local chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Association of Social Workers, National Council of Churches, Negro American Labor Council, and Urban League, in association with the Hough Area Council (a neighborhood improvement association), Hough Community Opportunity Board (the Hough neighborhood branch of the Council for Economic Opportunities in Greater Cleveland, a private nonprofit which served low-income people), the local Negro Pastors' Association, and the Wade Park Citizens' Association created the Citizens' Committee for Review of the Grand Jury Report. After holding several public hearings, during which extensive testimony about police brutality during the riot was heard, the panel released its own report on October 5, 1966. The citizens' committee report condemned the grand jury report as specious, and concluded that despair, police brutality, poverty, racism, and a city government heedless of the plight of African Americans caused the riots. The citizens' panel requested that the grand jury report be legally quashed; that fair housing legislation be adopted by the city; that the city immediately implement a 16-point urban renewal agreement previously negotiated with the federal government; that the mayor begin meeting regularly with representatives of the Hough neighborhood; that the city study the constitutionality of a law giving police immunity from false arrest; that the city call for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the Cleveland police and their practice of holding people without charge; that the state pass a law giving citizens a mechanism to file grievances against government workers; that a grand jury investigate the shootings of Arnett, Giles, and the Townes family; and that the state of Ohio increase the level of welfare payments.\n\nContemporary historical analyses of the Hough Riots do not find evidence for claims of communist influence. As early as 1972, historians Estelle Zannes and Mary Jean Thomas pointed out that no evidence existed to implicate either black nationalists or communist organizations in the Hough Riots. Cleveland historian Leonard N. Moore notes that two undercover Cleveland police officers spent more than a year investigating the JFK House and black nationalist and communist groups in Hough, but found no evidence that these groups or individuals had planned or sustained the riots. In 2003, noted Ohio historian George W. Knepper called the grand jury report a \"simplistic and comfortable conclusion\" the nearly all-white city administration was more than willing to accept. Kyle Swenson, writing in \"Cleveland Scene\" in July 2016, called the grand jury report \"almost laughable. Instead of scratching at the deep economic and political grievances that led to a mass group of people to express their frustrations through violence, the official Cuyahoga County explanation was that the commies did it. Seriously.\" The report, he said, helped reinforce racial tension in Cleveland for decades. In the 21st century, all scholars reject the \"official narrative\" and its assertion that the riots were fomented and sustained by radical groups, and instead point to social problems like racism and poverty as the riot's cause.\n\n\"Hough cast a pall of fear and resentment that took years to dissipate, if it ever truly passed\", said Michael D. Roberts, who covered the Hough Riots as a reporter in 1966.\n\nThe Hough Riots caused $1 to $2 million in property damage ($ million to $ million in dollars), and destroyed the Hough Avenue commercial strip between E. 71st and E. 93rd Streets. Many merchants said they would never return to Hough. The riots depressed property values for decades below those found in surrounding black neighborhoods. Both black and white residents fled the area, causing population loss that lasted into 1990s before stabilizing. The attempts of residents who remained to redevelop their neighborhood were stymied by public and economic policies that led to further disinvestment.\n\nAlthough Cleveland needed financial assistance from the federal government to both rebuild and address its extensive problems, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) cut off federal urban renewal funding to the city in the wake of the Hough Riots because the administrations of Mayor Locher and his predecessors had been so dilatory and incompetent in completing projects. HUD also cancelled an existing $10 million grant, and rejected Cleveland's Model Cities Program application for fear the city would misspend the funds.\n\nThe Hough Area Development Corporation was formed in 1967 to stimulate investment in the neighborhood, but it proved ineffective and was disbanded in 1983 when federal funding ran out. Not until the late 1990s did the Community Development Corporations (CDCs) begin to play an important role in redevelopment of the neighborhood.\n\nHough changed radically between 1966 and 2000. Whereas the neighborhood had nearly 23,000 housing units in 1966, by the turn of the century it had just 8,409. The population had dropped to just 16,409 in 2000, while median income in the area had slumped to just 45 percent of the median of whites in Cleveland.\n\nWarren LaRiche was tried for the murder of Benoris Toney. LaRiche claimed self-defense, saying that Toney had pointed a gun at the car in which he was riding. An all-white jury deadlocked over his conviction in February 1967. LaRiche was acquitted of murder charges by a second all-white jury in December 1967.\n\nCourt of Common Pleas Judge John J. McMahon dismissed second-degree murder charges against Patsy C. Sabetta, driver of the car in which LaRiche rode, for lack of evidence.\n\nMayor Locher came under near-constant media attack in 1966 and 1967 for his failure to revitalize Cleveland and address the worsening racial tension in the city in the wake of the Hough Riots. He was perceived as an unsophisticated political populist whose administration lacked the modern bureaucratic and professional skills to effectively deal with the city's problems. The city's (mostly white) business establishment also withdrew its support for Locher.\n\nCleveland's African American community reacted very negatively to the \"official narrative\" of the Hough Riots. The city's black community was divided on how to solve issues like racism and poverty, and African American members of the Cleveland City Council focused more on patronage than meeting the needs of the communities they represented. Cleveland's African Americans were unified in condemning the \"official narrative\", however. Mayor Locher's refusal to acknowledge racism, poverty, and police brutality as causes of the Hough Riots united the black community so strongly that it propelled Carl Stokes to the mayor's office in 1967. Cleveland's business community rallied around Stokes largely because it had lost faith in Locher's analysis of the race problem in the city, and believed Stokes would implement policies which would prevent additional riots.\n\n\n"}

Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. \n\nThe three-field system let farmers plant more crops and therefore increase production. Under this system, the arable land of an estate or village was divided into three large fields: one was planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field was planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third was left fallow (unplanted). Cereal crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. The fallow fields were soon overgrown with weeds and used for grazing farm animals. Their excrement fertilized that field's soil to regain its nutrients. Crop assignments were rotated every year, so each field segment would be planted for two out of every three years. \n\nPreviously a \"two field system\" had been in place, with half the land being left fallow. With more crops available to sell and agriculture dominating the economy at the time, the three-field system created a significant surplus and increased economic prosperity. \n\nThe three-field system needed more plowing of land and its introduction coincided with the adoption of the moldboard plow. These parallel developments complemented each other and increased agricultural productivity. The legume crop needed summer rain to succeed, and so the three-field system was less successful around the Mediterranean. Oats for horse food could also be planted in the spring, which, combined with the adoption of horse collars and horseshoes, led to replacement of oxen by horses for many farming tasks, with an associated increase in agricultural productivity and the nutrition available to the population.\n\nOne of the first Germans to question this system, and new ways of expanding beyond this medieval system was Johann Friedrich Mayer, in his 1769 work \"Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen\".\n"}
{"id": "2216446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216446", "title": "Okhotny Ryad (Moscow Metro)", "text": "Okhotny Ryad (Moscow Metro)\n\nOkhotny Ryad () is a station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. It is situated in the very centre of Moscow in the Tverskoy District, near the Kremlin, Manezhnaya Square and State Duma. It is named after a nearby street, which name literally means \"hunters' row\".\n\nOkhotny Ryad station is located under what was originally the swamplands of the upper Neglinnaya River. Later two ancient churches stood on the site, and their graveyards were excavated during the construction of the station. The station opened as part of the original Metro line on 15 May 1935.\n\nOkhotny Ryad has been renamed more times than any other Metro station. Planned to be called Okhotnoryadskaya, it was opened as Okhotny Ryad instead. The station was renamed Imeni Kaganovicha in honour of Lazar Kaganovich during the brief period between 25 November 1955 and 1957, when its original name was restored. The station's name was changed once more on 30 November 1961, to Prospekt Marksa (the station still contains a mosaic portrait of Karl Marx). Finally, on 5 June 1990, the original name was restored once more.\n\nThe construction of Okhotny Ryad presented a number of engineering challenges. The task of wedging a metro station into the narrow space between two major buildings, the Hotel Moskva that has been re-built, and what is now the State Duma building, at a depth of only without damaging their foundations was further complicated by the difficult soil conditions in the area, including numerous underground water channels. The station was built using a so-called \"German\" method in which the station walls were constructed above ground and then lowered into the construction site. This helped to brace the foundations of the nearby buildings during the subsequent construction of the station vault and pylons.\n\nThe station was originally planned to be a bi-vault design similar to many London Underground stations, but Lazar Kaganovich, who was in charge of the Moscow Metro project at the time, insisted that the station be changed to a tri-vault design after of tunnel had already been bored. A major setback occurred when accumulated rainwater broke through the vault before it had been completely sealed and flooded the station. Though no one was injured in the disaster, construction had to be halted while the damage was repaired.\n\nThe architects, Yuri Revkovsky, N. Borov, and G. Zamskoy, employed a silvery marble from Italy for the finishing of the pylons, the only documented case where imported material was used in the Metro. The walls are faced with ceramic tile. The finishing of the station, which involved the installation of more than of marble, of plaster, and thousands of square metres of tile as well as lighting and decorations, was completed in just two weeks.\n\nIn 2004, Okhotny Ryad underwent a major renovation which included replacing the lighting elements inside the spheres and repainting the plaster from light beige to white. A further renovation took place in 2007/2008 when the old ceramic tiles were replaced by bright marble, though a small tiled section was retained. An average of 42,110 passengers per day enter the station through its vestibules with an additional 241,000 passengers entering via Teatralnaya.\n\nThe station has two subterranean vestibules, each linked with the platform via an escalator. During the construction of the vestibules, orders of the Moscow's party committee prohibited the obstruction of traffic, so \"American\" bridges had to be built over the pits of the future vestibules.\n\nThe eastern vestibule, through a mezzanine level is situated on the ground floor of a building situated on the corner of Bolshaya Dmitrovka street, Teatralny Drive, and Teatralnaya Square. The facade of this building was redesigned by Dmitry Chechulin and originally incorporated sculptures of athletes which were modeled after performers from the Moscow Circus. The original three N-type escalators were replaced by ET-5M units in 1997 (9.2 metres/30 ft high). The vestibule also acts as a transfer point to the Teatralnaya station.\n\nThe western vestibule's original N-type escalators were replaced in 1990 by the ET-5M series (also 9.2 metres/30 ft high). The vestibule's original entrance was built into the ground floor of Hotel Moskva, on the corner of Manezhnaya Square and Okhotny Ryad street. In 1959 the original structure was expanded with the first of many underground subway networks, and opened on 21 November. Dual descent entrances appeared on both corners of the Tverskaya Street, in front of the original entrance. The tunnel the continued along the facade of the Hotel Moskva, to offer entrance on both sides of the driveway between Manezhnaya Square and Revolution Square (closed to traffic only in 1990s). The final addition came in 1997 when a new underground mall was opened under the Manezhnaya Square, a direct access was made possible from the 1959 network. When the original Hotel Moskva was closed for demolition in 2004, the original entrance on its northwest corner was also demolished. It is unknown whether there are plans to restore it in the new building.\n\nOkhotny Ryad station is connected to Teatralnaya station of the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. Originally, when opened in 1938, transfer was only possible via the eastern vestibule. A direct transfer was under construction, but did not open until 30 December 1944. It features a long inclined tunnel that descends towards Teatranalaya. As the system grew, the original arrangement proved inadequate to handle the large passenger load and on 7 November 1974 a second transfer tunnel was opened.\n\nAccess to both transfer routes is done via escalators in the centre of the platform. The original two tandem N-type escalator pairs were replaced in 2001 by ET-5M series (8.3 metres high). In the mezzanine under the platform the northwards direction carries passenger to Teatralnaya, whilst the southern direction brings them from the station via the older 1940s transfer. Thus the escalators are also one way, with the western on descent and vice versa.\n\nThere is no direct transfer to Ploshchad Revolyutsii station of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line, which must be reached via Teatralnaya station.\n"}

In addition to his solo albums, Ricci has appeared as a guest harmonica player on albums with Johnny Winter, Nick Curran, Ana Popovic, Walter Trout, Cedric Burnside, The Mannish Boys and Joe Louis Walker among others. Ricci was named \"Best Harmonica Player\" at the 2010 Blues Music Awards, and also performed on Grammy winning 2014 Johnny Winter album \"Step Back\". In February 2015, Ricci played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Paul Shaffer Band, Tom Morello and Zac Brown to induct The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Ricci also continues touring with his band Jason Ricci and the Bad Kind as well as with other bands such as: \"Harmonicon\" (Sugar Blue, Billy Branch, Ricci), \"JJ Appleton and Jason Ricci\" and \"Mark Hummel's Blues Blow Off\". In 2017, Jason Ricci and The Bad Kind signed a record deal with the Eller Soul label and released their new album \"Approved By Snakes\" released on June 16, 2017.\n\nRaised in Portland, Maine, United States, Jason Ricci is the son of Joseph Ricci (co-founder of Elan School), and his first wife Cheryl Benton. His parents divorced in 1979. Ricci started performing in punk bands at the age of 14. Initially a vocalist, Ricci decided to pursue an instrument as well and the band chose harmonica for him. Being a blues fan, Ricci's mother encouraged his development as a harmonica player. Ricci names Howard Levy and his overblowing technique as having influenced his early harmonica playing as well as his decision not to switch to the saxophone. He further developed his playing style listening to and emulating Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, Pat Ramsey, and Adam Gussow. Jason has also directly referenced Pat Ramsey as a major influence in his developing a fast pentatonic approach to his playing, stating he prefers to be deliberate in his note choice in favor of speed for \"speed's sake\".\n\nIn 1995, Ricci moved from Portland to Memphis, TN, where shortly thereafter he placed first in the Sonny Boy Blues Society contest at 21 years of age. Later that same year Ricci recorded his first album, \"Jason Ricci\".\n\nIn Memphis, Ricci began playing with David Malone Kimbrough, son of Junior Kimbrough, and soon was a part of the bands of both Kimbroughs and was sitting in with R. L. Burnside. This also marked a dark period for Ricci, as drug addiction led to a one-year stint in jail.\nIn 1999, Ricci won the Mars National Harmonica Contest, and began playing with Keith Brown, later recording with him as well. In 2000, he received a two-page write up in Blues Access magazine by Adam Gussow (harmonica player for Satan and Adam) saying:\n\nI am convinced he along with New Jersey's Dennis Gruenling is one of the best harmonica players of his generation.\n\nGussow has also included Jason Ricci in the Top 10 All Time Harmonica Players list on his Modern Blues Harmonica website.\n\nAfter 15 months with Big Al and the Heavyweights, and a brief period of living in Raleigh, North Carolina, Ricci started his own band, Jason Ricci & New Blood, in 2002. This band features Shawn Starski, who, in June 2008, was named by \"Guitar Player\" magazine as one of the \"Top Ten Hottest New Guitarists.\" In 2005, Ricci was honored with the Muddy Waters Most Promising New Blues Artist award.\n\nIn 2007, Ricci and New Blood were signed to Eclecto Groove, a new subdivision of Delta Groove Productions. His first album with the label, titled \"Rocket Number Nine,\" was released October 23, 2007. Later in 2009 the band recorded \"Done With The Devil\" for the same Label. \"Done With The Devil\" signaled a new direction in Ricci's musical inspiration, as his study of the occult strongly influenced the writing on the album. The band as a whole has been nominated for Blues Band of the Year three times by Blues Wax magazine. Ricci won the Blues Critic Award for Harmonica Player of the Year (2008) and was nominated for a Blues Music Award for Harmonica Player of the Year in 2009 and 2010. By January 2011, Ricci had relocated to New Orleans, and assembled a new band, Approved By Snakes, with guitarist John Lisi. Ricci received \"Best Harmonica Player\" at the May 6, 2010 Blues Music Awards.\n\nRicci played harmonica on the song \"My Babe\" from his 2014 album \"Step Back\". The album won the Grammy Award for Best Blues Album in February 2015.\n\nIn February 2015, Ricci began a national tour with a new band named Jason Ricci and the Bad Kind.\n\nIn April 2015, Ricci played harmonica on the song \"Born in Chicago\" with Zac Brown and Tom Morello at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony for The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. In August 2017, Ricci was awarded the \"Bernie Bray Harmonica Player of the Year Award\" by The Society for the Preservation and Advancement of the Harmonica at the SPAH annual conference in Tulsa, OK. In 2018, Ricci received Blues Music Award nominations both for best harmonica instrumentalist and best rock blues artist, of which he was awarded best harmonica instrumentalist.\n\nRicci participates as an Expert Guide (instructor) in the Harmonica Collective, an annual conference for harmonica players wishing to improve their skills and collaborate with other musicians, which he co-founded with Winslow Yerxa in 2013. He also posts free video harmonica lessons to his web site, and teaches live lessons via Skype.\n\nRicci has been openly \"queer\" gay/bisexual most his career and has been outspoken about this subject in many interviews. This has been a professional obstacle as well as an opportunity for Ricci to challenge both gay stereotypes and traditional blues expectations:\n\nThe [gay] community doesn't like drum sets and guitars and actual live music. They're used to lip-synching, and dudes in dresses, and Madonna, and Cher, and techno beats. Those are the things that kept me from coming out earlier. I felt like I had nothing in common with the gay community, and I still don't feel like I have a lot in common with the community. I'm hoping that changes, but the majority of their icons are press-friendly little Mickey Mouse-doll figureheads that you're more likely to see on a show redecorating somebody's house than onstage at a blues festival... When I came out of the closet as a gay white male from an upper-middle-class suburban home, I came out as not just gay, but as a white guy, and as a guy who likes punk, and as a guy who didn't come from total poverty, and all those things that we associate with being 'blues' things. And when I did that, I wanted to sing about that. I wanted to write songs about what my life was like, and I wanted to use terminology that was modern.\nRicci's openness with being gay has occasionally been a difficult issue in the traditionally conservative blues world, as he's been \"disinvited\" from a number of venues and events.\n\nJason Ricci married Kaitlin Dibble on May 17, 2017.\n\n\nRicci has also appeared as a guest harmonica player with Johnny Winter, Nick Curran, Ana Popovic, Walter Trout, Cedric Burnside, The Mannish Boys and Joe Louis Walker among others.\n\n"}

He notched his first victory with the Giants on May 21 vs. the Montréal Expos. On July 28 against the San Diego Padres, Wayne was removed from the game with a lower back strain. Franklin was activated from the disabled list on August 18, in between games of a double header against the Expos. He made a spot start for San Francisco in the nightcap, only giving up one run in six innings to earn the victory. Franklin returned to the bullpen for his final 6 appearances, recording a 4.26 ERA. He played in the Venezuelan Winter League in the offseason.\n\nOn March 30, 2005, Franklin was released by the Giants after appearing in 8 spring training games for the team. He was picked up by the New York Yankees as a free agent on April 4.

{"id": "2216473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216473", "title": "Conrad Nagel", "text": "Conrad Nagel\n\nConrad Nagel (March 16, 1897 – February 24, 1970) was an American film, stage, television and radio actor. He was considered a famous matinée idol and leading man of the 1920s and 1930s. He was given an Academy Honorary Award in 1940 and three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\n\nBorn in Keokuk, Iowa, into an upper-middle-class family, he was the son of a musician father, Dr. Frank L. Nagel, who was of German descent, and a mother, Frances (née Murphy), who was a locally praised singer. Nagel's mother died early in his life, and he always attributed his artistic inclination to growing up in a family environment that encouraged self-expression. His father, Frank, became dean of the music conservatory at Highland Park College and when Nagel was three, the family moved to Des Moines.\n\nAfter graduating from Highland Park College in Des Moines, Iowa, Nagel left for California to pursue a career in the relatively new medium of motion pictures where he garnered instant attention from the Hollywood studio executives. With his frame, blue eyes, and wavy blond hair; the young, Midwestern Nagel was seen by studio executives as a potentially wholesome matinee idol whose unpretentious all-American charm would appeal to the nation's nascent film-goers.\n\nNagel was immediately cast in film roles that cemented his \"unspoiled lover\" image. His first film was the 1918 retelling of \"Little Women\", which quickly captured the public's attention and set Nagel on a path to silent film stardom. His breakout role came in the 1920 film, \"The Fighting Chance\", opposite Swedish starlet Anna Q. Nilsson. In 1918, Nagel joined The Lambs, the historical theater club.\n\nIn 1927, Nagel starred alongside Lon Chaney Sr., Marceline Day, Henry B. Walthall and Polly Moran in the now lost Tod Browning directed horror film, \"London After Midnight\". Unlike many other silent films stars, Nagel had little difficulty transitioning to sound films. His baritone voice was judged to be perfect for sound, so he appeared in about thirty films in only two years. He described the time as a \"great adventure.\" He was working so steadily that one night when he and his wife planned to go to the movies, he was in the movie playing at Grauman's, Loew's, and Paramount's theaters. \"We couldn't find a theater where I wasn't playing. So we'd go back home. I was an epidemic.\" He spent the next several decades being very well received in high-profile films as a character actor. He was also frequently heard on radio and made many notable appearances on television.\n\nOn May 11, 1927, Nagel was among 35 other film industry insiders to found the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS); a professional honorary organization dedicated to the advancement of the arts and sciences of motion pictures. Fellow actors involved in the founding included: Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Richard Barthelmess, Jack Holt, Milton Sills, and Harold Lloyd. He served as president of the organization from 1932 to 1933. He was also a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). Nagel was elected to The Lambs, the New York-based theater organization, in 1918.\n\nNagel was the host of the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony held on November 5, 1930, the 5th Academy Awards on November 18, 1932, and a co-host with Bob Hope at the 25th Academy Awards ceremony on March 19, 1953. The 21-year gap between his appearances in 1932 and 1953 is a record for an Oscar ceremonies host.\n\nNagel was the announcer for \"Alec Templeton Time\", a musical variety program on NBC Radio in the summer of 1939. He was the host on \"Silver Theatre\", a summer replacement program that began June 8, 1937.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1947, he hosted and directed the radio program \"Silver Theater\". He then hosted the popular TV game show \"Celebrity Time\" from 1948 to 1952 and the DuMont Television Network program \"Broadway to Hollywood\" from 1953 to 1954. In 1961, again on television but in an acting role, he made a guest appearance on the popular courtroom drama \"Perry Mason\", portraying the character Nathan Claver, an art collector and murderer, in the episode \"The Case of the Torrid Tapestry\".\n\nTempleton later hosted his own TV show \"It's Alec Templeton Time\" on the DuMont Television Network from June 1955 to August 1955. From September 14, 1955 to June 1, 1956, Nagel hosted \"Hollywood Preview\", a 30-minute show on the DuMont Television Network which featured Hollywood stars with clips of upcoming films.\n\nNagel married and divorced three times. His first wife, actress Ruth Helms, gave birth to a daughter, Ruth Margaret (October 29, 1920-June 14, 2013). His second wife was actress Lynn Merrick. His third wife was Michael Coulson Smith, who gave birth to a son Michael.\n\nNagel died in 1970 in New York City at the age of 72. A spokesman for the office of the Chief Medical Examiner said that Nagel's death was \"due to natural causes\", more specifically, a heart attack and emphysema. He added that no autopsy was planned. Nagel was cremated at Garden State Crematory in North Bergen, New Jersey. His remains are interred at the Lutheran Cemetery in Warsaw, Illinois.\n\nIn 1940, Nagel was given an Honorary Academy Award for his work with the Motion Picture Relief Fund. For his contributions to film, radio, and television, Conrad Nagel was given three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1719 Vine Street (motion pictures), 1752 Vine Street (radio), and 1752 Vine Street (television).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2216478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216478", "title": "Los Cabos Municipality", "text": "Los Cabos Municipality\n\nLos Cabos () is a municipality located at the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, in the state of Baja California Sur. It encompasses the two towns of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo (the municipal seat) linked by a twenty-mile Resort Corridor of beach-front properties and championship golf courses.\n\nThe area was remote and rural until the latter 20th century, when the Mexican government began to develop Cabo San Lucas for tourism, which then spread east to the municipal seat. The main draw is the climate and geography, where desert meets the sea, along with sport fishing, resorts and golf. This tourism is by far the main economic activity with over two million visitors per year. Over 1 million visit from the United States.\n\nAlthough San José del Cabo is the seat of government for the municipality of Los Cabos, it is smaller than the other city of Cabo San Lucas. However, because of federal and private investments in tourism, its growth is now rivaling that of the more famous resort area.\n\nThis growth has been regulated to outside of the town center, especially to the south where the beaches are, leaving the historic town center quiet and relatively unchanged. There are still cobblestone streets, adobe houses, jacaranda trees and a central square in front of a church that dates from the 1700s, where people still gather in the evening when it is cooler.\n\nA number of the large houses in the center date from the 19th century, and most of these have been converted into restaurants, art galleries and shops selling everything from fine handcrafts, silver, local gemstones and souvenirs. The art scene in the town is well-developed because of tourism and people with vacation homes. These shops carry high end paintings, sculptures in from traditional Mexican, Mexican contemporary and international artisans and artists.\n\nDuring the high season from October to May, these galleries stay open late into the night. The town has resisted the addition of large shopping malls and chain stores. There is also some colonial era architecture as well, but this style has more in common with colonial towns to the north into the United States rather than the center and south of Mexico.\n\nThe main example of colonial architecture here is the town's parish church. It was part of the Estero de las Palmas de San José del Cabo Mission, founded in 1730. The facade is marked with a tile mural depicting the martyrdom of founder Nicolás Tamaral, killed by the local Pericu people . The patron saint of the town is Saint Joseph, whose feast day is celebrated here on March 19. Another important occasion is the feast of the Our Lady of the Pillar on October 12. Occasions like these are marked with traditional dance in dress styles known as “Flor de Pitaya” and the “La Cuera.”\n\nOther important landmarks in the town include the municipal hall (palacio municipal), which dates from 1981 and the cultural center or Casa de Cultura, housed in a 19th-century building.\n\nThe tourist area of the town is the area between the town proper and the shoreline. This area has a nine-hole golf course and a line of hotels and resorts facing the ocean, which served over 900,000 hotel guests in 2011.\n\nSan Jose del Cabo is the seat and the government for the communities found in a 3,451.51km2 area, located in the extreme south of the state of Baja California Sur. It is connected to the capital of La Paz via the Transpeninsular Highway .\n\nThe municipality borders that of La Paz to the north, with the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California surrounding it in the other directions. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a syndic and fourteen representatives called regidors.\n\nThe main areas of the municipality are the seat, Cabo San Lucas, and the tourist corridor along the coast between them. Although San Jose del Cabo is the government, Cabo San Lucas has a higher population and its natural arch at Land's End is the symbol for the municipality. Outside of the two main cities, other important communities include Colonia del Sol, Las Veredas, Colonia Los Congrejos, San José Viego and La Ribera.\n\nThe municipality is one of the most important tourist destinations in Mexico, for its fishing, beaches, and resorts. Historical landmarks are relatively few but include the municipal hall, the Casa de Cultura in San Jose del Cabo, the Faro Viejo and the San Jose del Cabo and Santiago de las Coras missions. The latter was founded in 1721 by Ignacio María Napoli.\n\nThe city of Cabo San Lucas, about twenty miles to the west of San Jose del Cabo, is far more commercial. Unlike most Mexican towns, Cabo San Lucas has no main plaza or large cathedral. Instead, it is centered around the marina and entertainment district. Up until the latter 20th century, the area was a small fishing village when tourist infrastructure was begun. Despite its success, high rise construction has been kept limited, focusing on resorts and sand-top restaurants in the beach area.\n\nThe main attractions are fishing, nightlife and whale watching. It is a place for vacation, where most visitors stay at all-inclusive resorts. The two main events during the year are Spring Break and Sammy Hagar’s birthday which happens on the second weekend in October as his birthday is October 13, 1947. The latter focuses on his Cabo Wabo bar and restaurant in the city.\n\nThe success of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo has created a tourist corridor along the coastal highway between the cities. While there has been some development of resorts, hotels, and golf courses, there are still smaller isolated and undeveloped beaches.\n\nBy far the main economic activity for the municipality is tourism, focused on a shoreline corridor between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Most visitors come from the United States (especially California) and Canada, followed by Mexico, and many visitors return year after year. Visitors can get by in Cabo San Lucas purely in English and use U.S. dollars.\n\nMost of the about two million visitors a year arrive by plane to the Los Cabos airport, but the Cabo San Lucas marina also has facilities for cruise ships. In 2012, the area has hotel occupancy of just over 60% with 248 cruise ships visiting. The area's high end resorts have also attracted notable names such as Bruce Willis, Kelly Preston and John Travolta, and San Jose del Cabo also has a notable expatriate population, mostly retirees who have economic influence.\n\nThe main draw for most visitors has been the environment, where the desert meets the sea, best symbolized by El Arco, a natural stone arch over the ocean in Cabo San Lucas where the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California meet. The natural features have led to ecotourism such as boat tours to El Arco, tours of the San Jose Estuary and the coral reefs of Cabo Pulmo, and whale watching from January to March, when the animals are here to breed.\n\nSports fishing is a major and the longest established draw as there are about 800 species of fish in the waters off the coast. High season for this activity is in the summer, the season for marlin, although fishing for various other species extends all year. There are certain exotic species that are off limits due to conservation concerns and others are “catch-and-release” only.\n\nThere are four main golf courses in the municipality, designed by the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Pete Dye. Other activities for tourists include snorkeling, diving, dune-buggy rides, camel rides, zip-lining, rides on water-propelled jet packs, surfing (especially at the Acapulquito Beach), jet-ski riding, kayaking, sailing, horseback riding, ATV riding, hang gliding, mountain biking, camping, tennis and rappelling. Off the beaten path, there is the town of Miraflores (for its leather crafts), the Santiago fossil museum, the traditional towns of Caduaño, San Antonio and San Bartolo and a glass blowing factory.\n\nLos Cabos hosts a culinary event called Ritmos, Colores y Sabores, which attracts chefs from the United States and Europe. The gastronomy of the region is based on seafood, which includes clams, marlin, snails, tuna and shark. A locally produced liquor is Damiana, sweet and flavored with a local herb, said to be an aphrodisiac.\n\nThe main export of the municipality is the production of salt. There are also limited mineral deposits, especially in the Capuano and Mezquite areas such as limestone and granite.\n\nThe small town of Miraflores is known for its leatherwork, especially saddles and other gear for horseback riding. Jewelry and decorations made with shells are produced in San José del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas and Santa Rosa.\n\nDespite the development, 28.5% live in poverty and 5.6% live in extreme poverty; 18.1% live in substandard housing and 27.1% need food assistance. There are 313 schools from the primary to high school level. 9.3 years of schooling for those over 15. There are two vocational schools and twelve centers for adult education. There are no schools specifically targeting an indigenous population.\n\nThe municipality of Los Cabos is at the southern end of the Baja California peninsula, where desert meets the sea and the Gulf of California meets the Pacific Ocean. The area was originally underwater, evidenced by the many fossils of marine animals, which are up to 25 million years old. The basement rock underlying Los Cabos formed even earlier, approximately 115 million years ago.\n\nThe municipality has an average altitude of forty meters above sea level. There are three main terrain types, mountain terrain, semi flat areas and flat areas. The mountains consist of the Sierra de la Laguna and the Sierra de San Lázaro, both formed of volcanic rock, covering about fifteen percent of the total territory with peaks between 400 and 1000 meters. The semi flat areas are located between the coast and the mountain ranges, mostly of sedimentary rock and account for sixty percent of the territory. The flat areas are along the coast, beaches and alluvial plains, which account for twenty five percent of the territory.\n\nOne of the main natural resources is the beaches. Major beaches include Los Frailes, Buena Vista, Agua Caliente, Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Chileno and Punta Colorada, often promoted together as the Costa de Oro (Golden Coast). One very popular beach in Cabo San Lucas is Lover's Beach, which is surrounded by dramatic rock shapes. The sea experiences lows of 72–73 °F (22–23 °C) in winter, and highs of 77–84 °F (25–29 °C) during the summer months.\nAs it is on the edge of the desert that covers most of the Baja California peninsula, it is one of the sunniest locations in the world, with an average of 320 days of sunshine per year. The climate is characterized as hot and dry to the north of the town of San José del Cabo, hot and semi moist in San José and along the southern coast and temperate and dry in the highest elevations, because of cyclones that hit this area. Average annual temperature is 24C with the coolest month being January. There is a rainy season in the summer, with most rain in September. The rain and terrain make for a variety of micro climates, including areas with a climate similar to the Mediterranean. Areas between 0 and 400 meters are desert and semi-desert, with many areas having deep sand deposits. Higher elevations get more water and can have pine forests.\n\nThe main surface water of the municipality is the Río San José or San José River, which runs north to south, mostly during the rainy season. Other streams run only during rains and include Santiago, Miraflores, Caduaño and Las Palmas. There are subterranean deposits of water such as the Santiago and San José del Cabo, but the lack of water is the main impediment to human development in the area.\nThe Río San José stops just shy of the ocean, with a one km long sand bar creating an estuary, the third largest in Mexico. This pooling of brackish water has created an oasis in the surrounding Sarcocaule desert. The Río San José flows largely underground for from its origin in the Sierra de la Laguna (Laguna Mountains), although its Miramonte River tributary adds almost an additional . Its tributaries flow down the eastern side of the sierra and include Santa Rosa, Santa Lázaro, San Miguel, San Ignacio (at La Palma), Caduaño, Miraflores and San Bernard.\n\nThe river used to flow above ground until the beginning of the 20th century due to anthropogenic causes. For more than 250 years the Río San José has furnished drinking and irrigation water for the town of San Jose del Cabo, beginning as a source of fresh water for Spanish galleons traveling back from the Philippines. Over the sand bar from the estuary is a bay referred to by early Spanish explorers, including Sebastian Vizcaino, as the Bahía de San Bernabé or Bay of San Bernabé, and now as the Bay of San José del Cabo.\n\nThe estuary is home to both native and migratory birds and aquatic species, 250 species of tropical birds alone. Most of the migratory species use the area as a stopover on their way to southern Mexico, Central American and South America. It also acts as a nursery to many juvenile and larval stage species. It was declared a state environmental reserve, but pollution and excessive water extraction has caused it to degenerate, leading to a complaint by Greenpeace. One effort to improve the water situation is the creation of new water treatment plants in the 2000s.\n\nVegetation varies mostly by altitude and soil type and how much moisture the area receives. However almost all species are those adapted to desert and semi-desert zones. The highest elevations have pine forests. Wildlife is varied and includes mammals such as badgers, skunks, coyotes, foxes, pumas and other wild cats, deer, raccoons, rabbits, bats and various rodents. Bird species include quail, doves, cardinals, woodpeckers, swallows and marine species such as pelicans and seagulls. There are over 850 species of aquatic animals off the coast such as marlin, sailfish, swordfish, tuna, dorado and whales. Many species and subspecies of both plants and animals are endemic only to Baja California.\n\nThe indigenous Pericu names for San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas were Añiñi and Yenecami, respectively, with the current names given by the colonizing Spanish. The name of San José was given by Nicolás Tamaral in honor of José de la Fuente Peña y Castrejón, the Marquis of Villa Puente who sponsored the mission. The appendix of “de Los Cabos” is to distinguish it from San José de Comondú as well as its proximity to Cabo San Lucas. San Jose was also known as San Barnabé, as the nearby bay was named this. Pirate Thomas Cavendish called Cabo San Lucas “Safe Port” as he hid there from Spanish authorities. The seal for the municipality of Los Cabos (referring to the two cities) was approved by the state government in 1981.\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived the main indigenous group in the area was the Pericus, a hunter-gather culture with Stone Age tools. It is possible that these people arrived to the region with a more evolved culture which later simplified to adapt to the harsh conditions. Evidence of this includes the region's cave paintings as the peoples found by the Jesuits did not have an artistic tradition. The Pericu people and culture were distinct from other indigenous groups, first by being taller and second by being polygamous in a tribal organization. Their diet consisted of local seeds and fruits, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. Men were in charge of large game hunting of deer. \n\nHernán Cortés himself arrived here in 1535, and named the Gulf of California the Sea of Cortés (Mar de Cortés) the name still used for it in Spanish. The harsh conditions impeded colonization by the Spanish, which did not begin in earnest until 1730, when Father José Echeverría and Father Nicolás Tamaral founded a mission in what is now San Jose del Cabo in 1730. This date is considered the founding of the town, although a second ceremonial found took place in 1822, when it was declared a town of the Baja California territory.\n\nDiseases brought by Europeans devastated indigenous groups here, and in 1768 more missionaries arrived. While colonization was slow, the area was important as a way station for the Manila Galleon and other ships, which stopped here for fresh water, as well as fruits and vegetables.\n\nHowever, its remoteness also made it a place for pirates to hide. The first pirate in the area was Francis Drake in 1578, followed shortly after by Thomas Cavendish, both after the treasures from Spain's Asia trade. One major attack was that on the Santa Ana Galleon, whose looting caused the Spanish colonial government to explore and map the area around Cabo San Lucas at the very beginning of the 17th century. There were recommendations to establish a mission here, but this was rejected in favor of Loreto. This left Cabo San Lucas as a strategic hideout for English pirates until the 18th century. In 1709, pirate Woodes Rogers attacked the Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño. Hiding nearly a month in Cabo San Lucas, he also mapped the area and wrote detailed descriptions. He was followed by George Shelvocke in 1721, who later published the oldest known drawings of the Pericues.\n\nAfter Independence, the Baja Peninsula was part of the California province, but Cabo San Lucas was named head of a municipality. Its remoteness kept the area out of active participation of most of Mexico's 19th and early 20th century tumultuous history. One exception was the Mexican American War. Resistance to U.S. forces was organized in the small community of Santa Anita, near San José, headed by José Matías Moreno, Vicente Mejia and José Antonio Mijares, who was in charge of the marina at Cabo San Lucas. One of the main streets in the town is now named after Mijares, who died defending the town.\n\nThe major political players during the Mexican Revolution were Manuel Gonzalez and Pedro Orozco, along with Félix Ortega. In 1915, Ildefonso Green Ceseña, head of forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza, drove out those of Francisco Villa out of the southern part of the peninsula.\n\nSome development of the area began after the Mexican Revolution with a lighthouse at Cabo Falso as early as 1905, just southwest of Cabo San Lucas, in part to remind U.S. ships in the waters here that the territory remained Mexican. Today, it is known as the “Faro Viejo” (Old Lighthouse) and is a historic monument. In 1917, a U.S. company began tuna fishing operations here and had a floating processing plant. In 1927, the Compañía de Productos Marinas based its operations in Cabo San Lucas and helped develop the port to make it open to tourism later. In the 1920s, the first road connecting San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas was begun but not completely finished until 1970.\n\nFor the most part, the area remained rural and undeveloped until the latter 20th century, when the federal agency Fonatur began to develop a tourism industry here. Development began with Cabo San Lucas for vacationers, but then spread to San Jose del Cabo, but with a different direction with more art galleries and promotion of its traditional Mexican character.\n\nThe current municipality of Los Cabos was created in 1981, separated from the municipality of La Paz, with the seat at San Jose del Cabo. The town had previously been a municipal seat of a municipality of the same name in 1917 but lost this in a political reorganization in 1972.\n\nReports of increased violence in the Los Cabos municipality are connected to the 2016 arrest of drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman, nicknamed \"El Chapo,\" following an interview with US actor Sean Penn for \"Rolling Stone Magazine\". Instability that eluded Los Cabos, Mexico's \"most prized and protected tourist resorts\" according to the \"Los Angeles Times\", stemmed from the void in the drug cartel.\n\nGenerally the violence from fragmented, warring factions, seeking to gain control in the region, has not targeted tourists. \"The vast majority of the violence is playing out in the poor desert hillside communities that house resort workers, far from the beaches that have made this region a magnet for business moguls and Hollywood stars.\" The \"lucrative drug-smuggling corridor\" of the twin cities of Los Cabos has led to bloodshed among rival gangs contributing to the fastest-rising homicide rate in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur from 2015 to 2017.\n\nWarring gangs often use intimidation tactics to announce their presence such as hanging victims in public spaces next to banners called \"narcomantas.\" In December 2017, rival gangs hanged six bodies from bridges near major resorts, one with a public banner that was translated as: \"This is what will happen to anyone who does not fall into line with us. It has been made more than clear that we hold all the power and that Baja north and south are ours.\" Such signs are used to threaten government officials and serve as warnings or intentions of \"cleansing\" the drug-smuggling corridor. The city since then has considerably lowered the crime rate after the local government cracked down on violent cartels in early 2018. \n\n\n"}

The station went on the air under the experimental call sign of 10AD broadcasting at 1210 kilocycles in 1923. It was granted a full license as CFNB in 1926. CFNB then moved to AM 1030 in 1933, and finally to AM 550 in 1934.\n\nThe station was affiliated with the CBC's Trans-Canada Network. In 1959 the station increased its power to 50,000 watts, giving it full-time coverage over most of the Maritime Provinces. The CBC affiliation was dropped in 1964 when the network started its own station in Fredericton, 920 CBZ. CFNB played an adult contemporary format before switching to oldies in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1996, CFNB's parent company, Radio Atlantic, was granted permission to move its signal to 106.9 FM and to eliminate the AM transmitter. The call sign changed in the process, and after a brief simulcast period, CFNB 550 signed off the air on June 11 of that year. The new station, CIBX, played soft adult contemporary music. The former CFNB call sign now belongs to a radio station in D'Arcy, British Columbia, known as CFNB-FM.

Its architects were A. I. Gontskevich and S. Sulin.\n\nTo prevent the disruption of traffic, Biblioteka Imeni Lenina was built using underground excavation rather than cut and cover even though the station ceiling is just two metres (6.5 ft) below ground level. Soil conditions and the narrowness of the space in which the station was to be built necessitated a single-vault design, the only one on the first Metro line. The entire excavation was only 19.8 metres (65 ft) wide and 11.7 metres (38 ft) high. The main station vault was built from rubble stone set in concrete and reinforced with an iron framework. This was lined with an \"umbrella\" of bitumen-coated paper to prevent groundwater from seeping into the station. The station was finished with plaster, yellow ceramic tile, and marble.\n\nThe station originally had two entrance vestibules, one at either end. The southern vestibule, located between the old and new buildings of the State Library, is shared with Borovitskaya.

It is now preserved as a conservation area operated by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority.\nThe town was established in the early 19th century by Jacob Ball, a United Empire Loyalist.\n\nThe Ball or Bahl family had a long association with the English Crown, and had originally emigrated to the County of Norfolk in England from lands in what is now Germany. In 1690, the family purchased lands in New York's Mohawk Valley, paying one shilling per acre to the Crown. Subsequently, they emigrated and settled there.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the Ball family maintained their allegiance to the Crown. In 1782, Jacob moved to what is now Canada with most of his sons and fought with the Loyalist Butler's Rangers and Queen's Rangers militias for the remainder of the Revolutionary War. Jacob, a Captain in the Rangers, brought much of his company with him. The family received a land grant from the Crown in 1783, and the remainder of the family emigrated to Canada in the following year, 1784.\n\nTwo of Jacob's sons, John and George, received 1200 acres (486 ha) of land in Niagara in 1807. Twenty Mile Creek, which runs through the area, has two waterfalls. The Ball brothers built a grist mill, a saw mill at the lower falls and a woollen mill at the upper falls. During the War of 1812, the settlement was heavily utilized by the military, as part of a regiment was stationed there for a time.\n\nThe town began flourishing and soon a blacksmith, tailor, weaver and butcher lived on the land. By 1852 the population of the town, then Glen Elgin, grew to 19 inhabitants. In the late 1850s, the Great Western Railway was established and many moved away from Glen Elgin and were located closer to the railway. In 1962 Manly Ball sold the land to the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Area and the town, now known as Ball's Falls, is a tourist attraction.\n\nLocated in the Niagara region of Ontario, Ball's Falls currently occupies around one sixth of the 1200 acres bought by the Ball brothers. It has a mild climate as a result of its location, which is south of Lake Ontario and north of Lake Erie. There are two waterfalls on Twenty Mile Creek. The upper falls are 35 feet (10.7 m) high, and the lower falls are 90 feet (27.4 m) high. ]The falls can be viewed from above and below. The gorge has also become an area of scientific interest. The lower falls pass over Irondequoit limestone, a firm layer over several weaker sandstone layers. The rock of the upper falls is formed of the same unit, the Lockport Formation, that forms the crest of Niagara Falls.\n\nThousands of plant and animal species grow throughout the conservation area. The list of plant species totals 471 and includes plants such as wild sarsaparilla, green and white trilliums, wild ginger, wild geranium, Virginia bluebells, Canada yew, arrowhead, wild leek, asparagus, wild yam, red mulberry, wild columbine, Canada anemone, chokecherry, Virginia creeper and St. John's wort. Ball's Falls is made up of hardwoods mixed with coniferous trees, lying within the deciduous forest zone. Tree species include Eastern cottonwood, butternut, black walnut, shagbark hickory, white oak, tulip tree and slippery elm. Rare species include sycamore, sassafras and pignut hickory. The species of fish living in Twenty Mile Creek include the largemouth bass, yellow perch, grass pickerel, rock bass, green sunfish, creek chub and pumpkinseed. Among the species of birds found at Ball's Falls are the eastern bluebird, indigo bunting, house sparrows, northern cardinals, mallards, killdeer.\n\nAfter the purchase of Ball's Falls by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority in 1962, the area became a conservation area. The park features the Ball's Falls Centre for Conservation to help visitors learn of the area's cultural and natural history. The building, designed to have a limited impact of the surrounding environment, features permanent and temporary galleries, exhibits and interactive displays, including the conservation practices of the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, archaeological findings, and the watershed ecosystem of Twenty Mile Creek.\n\nStill standing within the park are the original Ball family home, an operating gristmill, a lime kiln, a restored church, a blacksmith shop, and a carriage shed. \n\n"}

His parents were Russian intellectuals, and his paternal grandmother Maria Sakhavyan had been a stage actress of national repute in Armenia.\n\nAt school, the young Yuri was a difficult and somewhat eccentric student, who made indifferent progress in a number of subjects and was almost expelled for poor and willful behaviour. However, it became clear that he was academically bright with an inquisitive temperament; he was an accomplished violinist, wrote romantic poetry and could draw with accuracy and attention to detail.\n\nIn 1940 at the age of 17, Knorozov left Kharkiv for Moscow where he commenced undergraduate studies in the newly created Department of Ethnology at Moscow State University's department of History. He initially specialised in Egyptology.\n\nKnorozov's study plans were soon interrupted by the outbreak of World War II hostilities along the Eastern Front in mid-1941. From 1943 to 1945 Knorozov served his term in the second world war in the Red Army as an artillery spotter.\n\nAt the closing stages of the war in May 1945, Knorozov and his unit supported the push of the Red Army vanguard into Berlin. It was here, sometime in the aftermath of the Battle of Berlin, that Knorozov is supposed to have by chance retrieved a book which would spark his later interest in and association with deciphering the Maya script. In their retelling, the details of this episode have acquired a somewhat folkloric quality, as \"...one of the greatest legends of the history of Maya research\". The story has been much reproduced, particularly following the 1992 publication of Michael D. Coe's \"Breaking the Maya Code\".\n\nAccording to this version of the anecdote, when stationed in Berlin, Knorozov came across the National Library while it was ablaze. Somehow Knorozov managed to retrieve from the burning library a book, which remarkably enough turned out to be a rare edition containing reproductions of the three Maya codices which were then known—the Dresden, Madrid and Paris codices. Knorozov is said to have taken this book back with him to Moscow at the end of the war, where its examination would form the basis for his later pioneering research into the Maya script.\n\nHowever, in an interview conducted a year before his death, Knorozov provided a different version of the anecdote. As he explained to his interlocutor, the Mayanist epigrapher Harri Kettunen of the University of Helsinki:\n\n\"Unfortunately it was a misunderstanding: I told about it [finding the books in the library in Berlin] to my colleague Michael Coe, but he didn't get it right. There simply wasn't any fire in the library. And the books that were in the library, were in boxes to be sent somewhere else. The fascist command had packed them, and since they didn't have time to move them anywhere, they were simply taken to Moscow. I didn't see any fire there.\"\n\nThe \"National Library\" mentioned in these accounts is not specifically identified by name, but at the time the library then known as the \"Preußische Staatsbibliothek\" (Prussian State Library) had that function. Situated on Unter den Linden and today known as the Berlin State Library (\"Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin\"), this was the largest scientific library of Germany. During the war, most of its collection had been dispersed over some 30 separate storage places across the country for safe-keeping. After the war much of the collection was returned to the library. However, a substantial number of volumes which had been sent for storage in the eastern part of the country were never recovered, with upwards of 350,000 volumes destroyed and a further 300,000 missing. Of these, many ended up in Soviet and Polish library collections, and in particular at the Russian State Library in Moscow.\n\nAccording to documentary sources, the so-called \"Berlin Affair\" is just one of many legends related to the personality of Knorozov. His student Ershova exposed it as a legend and also reported, that documents of Knorozov, first of all his military card, could be a proof, that he did not take part in the Battle of Berlin and was then in a different place, finishing his service in a military unit located near Moscow.\n\nIn the autumn of 1945 after World War II, Knorozov returned to Moscow State University to complete his undergraduate courses at the department of Ethnography. He resumed his research into Egyptology, and also undertook comparative cultural studies in other fields such as Sinology. He displayed a particular interest and aptitude for the study of ancient languages and writing systems, especially hieroglyphs, and he also read in medieval Japanese and Arabic literature.\n\nWhile still an undergraduate at MSU, Knorozov found work at the N.N. Miklukho-Maklai Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology (or IEA), part of the prestigious Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Knorozov's later research findings would be published by the IEA under its imprint.\n\nAs part of his ethnographic curriculum Knorozov spent several months as a member of a field expedition to the Central Asian Soviet republics of the Uzbek and Turkmen SSRs (what had formerly been the Khorezm PSR, and would much later become the independent nations of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union). On this expedition his ostensible focus was to study the effects of Russian expansionary activities and \"modern\" developments upon nomadic ethnic groups, of what was a far-flung frontier world of the Soviet state.\n\nAt this point the focus of his research had not yet been drawn on the Maya script. This would change in 1947, when at the instigation of his professor, Knorozov wrote his dissertation on the \"de Landa alphabet\", a record produced by the 16th century Spanish Bishop Diego de Landa in which he claimed to have transliterated the Spanish alphabet into corresponding Maya hieroglyphs, based on input from Maya informants. De Landa, who during his posting to Yucatán had overseen the destruction of all the codices from the Maya civilization he could find, reproduced his alphabet in a work (\"Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán\") intended to justify his actions once he had been placed on trial when recalled to Spain. The original document had disappeared, and this work was unknown until 1862 when an abridged copy was discovered in the archives of the Spanish Royal Academy by the French scholar, Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg.\n\nSince de Landa's \"alphabet\" seemed to be contradictory and unclear (e.g., multiple variations were given for some of the letters, and some of the symbols were not known in the surviving inscriptions), previous attempts to use this as a key for deciphering the Maya writing system had not been successful.\n\nIn 1952, the then 30-year-old Knorozov published a paper which was later to prove to be a seminal work in the field (\"Drevnyaya pis’mennost’ Tsentral’noy Ameriki\", or \"Ancient Writing of Central America\".) The general thesis of this paper put forward the observation that early scripts such as ancient Egyptian and Cuneiform which were generally or formerly thought to be predominantly logographic or even purely ideographic in nature, in fact contained a significant phonetic component. That is to say, rather than the symbols representing only or mainly whole words or concepts, many symbols in fact represented the sound elements of the language in which they were written, and had alphabetic or syllabic elements as well, which if understood could further their decipherment. By this time, this was largely known and accepted for several of these, such as Egyptian hieroglyphs (the decipherment of which was famously commenced by Jean-François Champollion in 1822 using the tri-lingual Rosetta Stone artefact); however the prevailing view was that Mayan did not have such features. Knorozov's studies in comparative linguistics drew him to the conclusion that the Mayan script should be no different from the others, and that purely logographic or ideographic scripts did not exist.\n\nKnorozov's key insight was to treat the Maya glyphs represented in de Landa's alphabet not as an alphabet, but rather as a syllabary. He was perhaps not the first to propose a syllabic basis for the script, but his arguments and evidence were the most compelling to date. He maintained that when de Landa had commanded of his informant to write the equivalent of the Spanish letter \"b\" (for example), the Maya scribe actually produced the glyph which corresponded to the \"syllable\", /be/, as spoken by de Landa. Knorozov did not actually put forward many new transcriptions based on his analysis, nevertheless he maintained that this approach was the key to understanding the script. In effect, the de Landa \"alphabet\" was to become almost the \"Rosetta stone\" of Mayan decipherment.\n\nA further critical principle put forward by Knorozov was that of synharmony. According to this, Mayan words or syllables which had the form consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) were often to be represented by two glyphs, each representing a CV-syllable (i.e., CV-CV). In the reading, the vowel of the second was meant to be ignored, leaving the reading (CVC) as intended. The principle also stated that when choosing the second CV glyph, it would be one with an echo vowel that matched the vowel of the first glyph syllable. Later analysis has proved this to be largely correct.\n\nUpon the publication of this work from a then hardly known scholar, Knorozov and his thesis came under some severe and at times dismissive criticism. J. Eric S. Thompson, the noted British scholar regarded by most as the leading Mayanist of his day, led the attack. Thompson's views at that time were solidly anti-phonetic, and his own large body of detailed research had already fleshed-out a view that the Maya inscriptions did not record their actual history, and that the glyphs were founded on ideographic principles. His view was the prevailing one in the field, and many other scholars followed suit.\n\nAccording to Michael Coe, “during Thompson’s lifetime, it was a rare Maya scholar who dared to contradict” Sir Thompson on the value of Knorozov’s contributions or on most other questions.  As a result, decipherment of Maya scripts took much longer than their Egyptian or Hittite counterparts and could only take off after Thompson’s demise in 1975.\n\nThe situation was further complicated by Knorozov's paper appearing during the height of the Cold War, and many were able to dismiss his paper as being founded on misguided Marxist-Leninist ideology and polemic. Indeed, in keeping with the mandatory practices of the time, Knorozov's paper was prefaced by a foreword written by the journal's editor which contained digressions and propagandist comments extolling the State-sponsored approach by which Knorozov had succeeded where Western scholarship had failed. However, despite claims to the contrary by several of Knorozov's detractors, Knorozov himself never did include such polemic in his writings.\n\nKnorozov persisted with his publications in spite of the criticism and rejection of many Mayanists of the time. He was perhaps shielded to some extent from the ramifications of peer disputation, since his position and standing at the institute was not adversely influenced by criticism from Western academics.\n\nKnorozov further improved his decipherment technique in his 1963 monograph \"The Writing of the Maya Indians\" and published translations of Mayan manuscripts in his 1975 work \"Maya Hieroglyphic Manuscripts\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, other Mayanists and researchers began to expand upon Knorozov's ideas. Their further field-work and examination of the extant inscriptions began to indicate that actual Maya history was recorded in the stelae inscriptions, and not just calendric and astronomical information. The Russian-born but American-resident scholar Tatiana Proskouriakoff was foremost in this work, eventually convincing Thompson and other doubters that historical events were recorded in the script.\n\nOther early supporters of the phonetic approach championed by Knorozov included Michael D. Coe and David Kelley, and whilst initially they were in a clear minority, more and more supporters came to this view as further evidence and research progressed.\n\nThrough the rest of the decade and into the next, Proskouriakoff and others continued to develop the theme, and using Knorozov's results and other approaches began to piece together some decipherments of the script. A major breakthrough came during the first round table or Mesa Redonda conference at the Maya site of Palenque in 1973, when using the syllabic approach those present (mostly) deciphered what turned out to be a list of former rulers of that particular Maya city-state.\n\nSubsequent decades saw many further such advances, to the point now where quite a significant portion of the surviving inscriptions can be read. Most Mayanists and accounts of the decipherment history apportion much of the credit to the impetus and insight provided by Knorozov's contributions, to a man who had been able to make important contributions to the understanding of this distant, ancient civilisation.\n\nIn retrospect, Prof. Coe writes that \"Yuri Knorozov, a man who was far removed from the Wesern scientific establishment and who, prior to the late 1980s, never saw a Mayan ruin nor touch a real Mayan inscription, had nevertheless, against all odds, “made possible the modern decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing.”\n\nAs his theories became more widely known, Knorozov was in 1956 granted leave to attend an international convention of Mesoamerican scholars in Copenhagen. This was to be his one and only venture for quite some time, since as a Soviet academic, Knorozov was subject to the usual restrictions placed on travel abroad. Over subsequent years western Mayanists needed to travel to Leningrad to meet up with him. It was not until 1990 that he was eventually able to leave Russia again and finally visit the ancient Maya homelands and archaeological sites in Mexico and Guatemala. This was at the invitation of the Guatemalan President Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo, at a time of improved diplomatic relations between the two countries. Cerezo presented him with an honorary medal, and Knorozov was able to extend his stay in the region, visiting several of the important Maya sites such as Tikal. \n\nThe government of Mexico awarded him the \"Orden del Águila Azteca\" (Order of the Aztec Eagle), the highest decoration awarded by Mexico to non-citizens, which was presented to him at a ceremony at the Mexican Embassy in Moscow on November 30, 1994.\n\nKnorozov had broad interest in, and contributed to, other investigative fields such as archaeology, semiotics, human migration to the Americas and the evolution of the mind. However, it is his contributions to the field of Maya studies for which he is best remembered.\n\nIn his very last years, Knorozov is also known to have pointed to a place in the United States as the likely location of Chicomoztoc, the ancestral land from which—according to ancient documents and accounts considered mythical by a sizable number of scholars—indigenous peoples now living in Mexico are said to have come.\n\nKnorozov died in Saint Petersburg on March 31, 1999, of pneumonia in the corridors of a city hospital (his daughter Ekaterina Knorozova declares that he died in a regular hospital ward at 6 am, surrounded by the care of his family during his last days), just before he was due to receive the honorary Proskouriakoff Award from Harvard University.\n\nAn incomplete listing of Knorozov's papers, conference reports and other publications, divided by subject area and type.

{"id": "2216504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216504", "title": "Ted Halstead", "text": "Ted Halstead\n\nTed Halstead (born July 25, 1968) is an American climate expert, author, policy entrepreneur, and public speaker who has founded four non-profit think tanks and advocacy organizations: the Climate Leadership Council, Americans for Carbon Dividends, New America, and Redefining Progress. His areas of expertise include climate policy, economic policy, environmental policy, healthcare, and political reform.\n\nHalstead has published numerous articles and two books, including \"The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics\" (co-authored with Michael Lind). His articles have appeared in \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the \"Financial Times\", \"Fortune\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Atlantic\", \"National Review\", and the \"Harvard Business Review\", among other publications.\n\nHalstead gave a TED Talk in 2017 that has over 1.5 million views and has been translated into 20 languages. He was selected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\nHalstead earned his bachelor's degree in 1990 from Dartmouth College, where he graduated Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in philosophy. He received his MPA in 1998 from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he was a Montgomery Fellow.\n\nHalstead is the founder, Chairman and CEO of the Climate Leadership Council, the broadest climate coalition in U.S. history. The Climate Leadership Council aims to promote a carbon dividends framework as the most cost-effective, politically-viable and equitable climate solution, and was founded in collaboration with a who's who of business, opinion and environmental leaders.\n\nThe Climate Leadership Council was soft-launched on May 19, 2016, with the publication of Halstead's white paper, \"Unlocking the Climate Puzzle\". This report summarizes the economic, geopolitical, and psychological reasons that climate progress is deadlocked, and suggests that a carbon dividends plan could overcome each of these barriers.\n\nThe Climate Leadership Council was officially launched on February 8, 2017 with the publication of \"The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends\", co-authored by James A. Baker III, Martin Feldstein, Halstead, Gregory Mankiw, Henry M. Paulson, Jr., George P. Shultz, Thomas Stephenson, and Rob Walton. This report argues that a new climate strategy based on carbon dividends can strengthen America's economy, reduce regulation, help working-class Americans, shrink government, and promote national security. A profile in \"Bloomberg\" suggested the release of this report \"may be the biggest day for climate policy since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.\"\n\nSince then, the Climate Leadership Council has recruited the broadest climate coalition in U.S. history as Founding Members. As of December 2019, the Founding Members of the Climate Leadership Council include:\n\nThe Climate Leadership Council's Baker-Shultz Carbon Dividends Plan is based on four inter-dependent pillars: (1) a gradually rising carbon fee, (2) carbon dividends for all Americans, (3) significant regulatory simplification, and (4) border carbon adjustment.\n\nIn 2019, the Climate Leadership Council helped organize the largest and most prominent public statement in the history of the economics profession.  The Economists Statement on Carbon Dividends, first published in The Wall Street Journal, was signed by over 3,500 U.S. economists, including all four living former Chairs of the Federal Reserve (Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker), 27 Nobel Laureate economists, and 15 former Chairs of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.\n\nHalstead is founding CEO of Americans For Carbon Dividends, a 501(c)(4) lobbying organization whose purpose is to promote a national carbon dividends solution. The national co-chairs of Americans for Carbon Dividends are former Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and former Democratic Senator John Breaux. Americans for Carbon Dividends was publicly launched in June 2018 with the publication of a New York Times op-ed by Senators Lott and Breaux, entitled “How to Break the Climate Impasse.”\n\nAmericans for Carbon Dividends is funded by a wide range of interests, including leading auto manufacturers, tech companies, energy companies and trade associations from across the economy, including those in oil and gas, solar, wind, nuclear and geothermal. Americans for Carbon Dividends represents the first time that leading oil and gas companies have put their money behind a meaningful national price on carbon, and the first time that such a broad coalition of U.S. energy interests have co-funded an advocacy campaign to promote a price on carbon.\n\nAs of January 2020, corporate funders of Americans for Carbon Dividends include: AWEA, BP, Calpine, ConocoPhillips, EDF Renewables, Exelon, ExxonMobil, First Solar, Ford, GM, IBM, Shell and Vistra Energy.\n\nThe leadership of Americans for Carbon Dividends also includes former Republican member of Congress Ryan Costello as Managing Director, Steve Rice as Managing Director and Greg Bertelsen as Executive Vice President.\n\nIn 1993, at age 25, Halstead founded Redefining Progress, an environmental economics think tank based in San Francisco, with a $15,000 seed grant from Echoing Green. Halstead served as Executive Director from 1993 to 1997.\n\nIn 1995, Redefining Progress released the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), an alternative to the GDP that takes social and environmental costs into account. The GPI was launched in an October 1995 cover story in \"The Atlantic\" entitled \"If The Economy Is Up, Why Is America Down?\" that Halstead co-authored with colleagues Clifford Cobb and Jonathan Rowe.\n\nIn 1997, Redefining Progress organized the Economists' Statement on Climate Change to promote market-based solutions to climate change. Over 2,600 economists and 19 Nobel Prize winners signed the statement.\n\nRedefining Progress and Halstead also promoted the idea of a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which the government of British Columbia was the first to implement in 2008.\n\nHalstead stepped down as Executive Director of Redefining Progress in 1997, moving into a position on the board. Redefining Progress closed its doors in 2008.\n\nHalstead founded New America (formerly known as New America Foundation) in 1999, at the age of 30, and served as founding President and CEO until 2007. Under his leadership, the organization grew rapidly to a staff of 100 and an annual budget of $10 million.\n\nNew America's original mission was to bring new voices and new ideas into the public debate, and to break out of the traditional liberal and conservative categories. James Fallows was the original chairman of New America's board of directors. Eric Schmidt, former Executive Chairman of Google and Alphabet Inc, served as chairman of New America's Board from 2008 to 2016.\n\nShortly after founding New America, Halstead and Michael Lind co-authored \"The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics,\" which Senator John McCain described as “A political manifesto worthy of the Information Age.” As a result, New America became known in its early years as a \"Radical Centrist\" think tank.\n\nOn December 10, 2001, \"The Washington Post\" published a Styles Section profile on Halstead entitled \"Big Thinker: Ted Halstead's New America Foundation Has It All: Money, Brains and Buzz\".\n\nSteve Coll succeeded Halstead as President and CEO of New America in 2007. Anne-Marie Slaughter became New America's third President and CEO in 2013.\n\nOn May 17, 2017, Halstead delivered a TED Talk entitled “A Climate Solution Where All Sides Can Win” at the 2017 TED Annual Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. As of December 2019, this TED Talk had received over 1.5 million views and was translated into 20 languages.\n\nHalstead begins his TED talk by detailing what he sees as the three main barriers to climate progress: a) the psychological barrier; b) the geopolitical barrier; and c) the partisan barrier. He goes on to explain how the conservative carbon dividends plan that he co-authored with leading Republican statesmen can overcome each of these barriers.\n\nIn his talk, Halstead states, “I’m convinced that the road to climate progress in the United Stated runs through the Republican party and the business community.” He also explains that under their plan, “We would end up with less regulation and far less pollution at the same time, while helping working class Americans get ahead.”\n\nAt the end of the talk, TED Curator Chris Anderson came on stage for a Q&A session with Halstead, and began by saying: \"I'm not sure I've seen a conservative get a standing ovation at TED before\".\n\nIn March 2008, shortly after getting married, Halstead and his wife Veronique Bardach set sail from France aboard a 50-foot Catana catamaran that they named Verite (a play on the first two letters of their names and of their dog Ria, who accompanied them).\n\nAfter sailing around the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean, making landfall at St. Barts. Next they sailed throughout the Caribbean and visited Venezuela and Colombia before crossing the Panama Canal. From there, they sailed to French Polynesia with a stop in the Galapagos Islands, after which they visited much of the South Pacific and wintered in Hawaii. Their next major crossing took them to the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Australia en route to Indonesia, where they spent a season. They continued on to Malaysia and Thailand by way of the Malacca Strait.\n\nAlthough Halstead and his wife hoped to complete their circumnavigation by returning to the Mediterranean via the Red Sea, the piracy situation in the Gulf of Aden in 2012 was too dangerous to permit this. So they sold their boat in Bali in late 2012 after 4.5 years of non-stop sailing, during which they visited 5 continents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216508", "title": "Bill Hall (utility player)", "text": "Bill Hall (utility player)\n\nWilliam Leonard Hall (born December 28, 1979) is an American former professional baseball utility player. He played in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants, and Baltimore Orioles from 2002 through 2012.\n\nIn the season, Hall helped the Brewers to their first .500 season since 1992. Splitting time among third base, shortstop, and second base, Hall had a batting average of .291 with 17 home runs and 62 RBIs.\n\nThe following season, Hall played behind newly acquired third baseman Corey Koskie, shortstop J. J. Hardy, and second baseman Rickie Weeks. On May 17, , Hall became the Brewers' starting shortstop after Hardy injured his ankle.\n\nOn Mother's Day 2006, with the Brewers playing the New York Mets, Hall hit a walk-off home run in the 10th inning. He hit the home run using a special Mother's Day pink bat with his mother, Vergie Hall, in attendance. After the game he dedicated the home run to her. When the bat was later auctioned to raise money for breast cancer research, Brewers owner Mark Attanasio purchased the bat and gave it to Hall's mother. The final bid on the bat was over $25,000, the third-highest total ever paid for an auction item on mlb.com.\n\nIn November 2006, Hall represented Major League Baseball in the Japan All-Star Series.\n\nHall became the Brewers' leader offensively with a .553 slugging percentage, 85 RBIs, and 35 home runs. He also led his team in runs scored (101), doubles (39), triples (4), total bases (297), and walks (63). As a result of his play, the Brewers named him the most valuable player of the team. On February 5, 2007, Hall signed a four-year deal for $24 million with the Brewers. There is also a $9.25 million option for a fifth season in 2011.\n\nHall opened the season as a center fielder, batting fourth. In 2007, he led all major league center fielders in errors with 9, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them, .971, as well as the lowest zone rating, .837.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, Hall drew three of the four walks issued by Justin Verlander in his no-hitter against the Brewers.\nHall entered the season as the Brewers' starting third baseman, following the move of Ryan Braun to left field. In May, the Brewers called up left-hander Russell Branyan from Triple-A to platoon at third base with Hall, after Hall struggled to get hits against right-handed pitchers for much of the early part of the season. Still in the lineup, Hall expressed his disappointment on June 3, 2008, by saying that if he was not going consistently to start for the Brewers, he might want to be traded in order to play every day (he had also grown tired of the Brewers changing his field position, which they had done three seasons in a row—usually something teams avoid so that players remain comfortable in their field positions and perform at their highest potential).\n\nFollowing his statements, many Brewers fans booed him at Miller Park, which he later admitted affected his confidence. In June and early July he began hitting much better, even against right-handed pitchers (including game-winning, back-to-back, go-ahead home runs against right-handed pitchers of division rival St. Louis Cardinals, in the 10th inning of the first game of the series and in the 9th inning of the second), and all but pushed Branyan back out of the starting lineup. When asked what had changed he said that he felt that he had found his swing in early July, and had subsequently regained his confidence. He thanked his teammates for supporting him through it all.\n\nHall's hitting then worsened, as he hit .235 in August, and .182 in September–October.\n\nHall ended the 2008 season with a .225 batting average, and a .174 batting average against right-handers.\n\nOn May 25 when the Brewers took on St. Louis in Milwaukee, Hall delivered the game-winning hit while matched up against a right-handed arm in Milwaukee. After the game, Hall declared \"I wanna get back to when I was good.\" Hall subsequently recorded just two hits in his next 22 at-bats.\n\nOn July 30, following a win against the Washington Nationals, Hall was sent down to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Despite not batting over .180 during May, June, or July, Hall has made some great strides with his swing while seeing batting practice action. Hall said this about being sent down:\nIn his second game with the Sounds, Hall went 2-for-4 with a double and a home run while batting third. Hall was subsequently recalled from Triple-A Nashville and started in right field for the Brewers on August 3, replacing an injured Corey Hart. Hall went 0-for-3 with a bases-loaded walk.\n\nOn August 12, Hall was designated for assignment, ending his 7-year stint with the Brewers.\n\nOn August 19, Hall was traded to the Seattle Mariners for minor league pitcher Ruben Flores.\n\nHall recorded his first hit as a Mariner on what was his first game with his new club on August 21. Hall finished the game with two hits and his first Mariner RBI.\n\nOn January 7, 2010, Hall was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Casey Kotchman and a minor league player to be named and cash. Hall was excited to return to a utility role, saying “I’m up for anything. I’ve played every position. I feel I’m athletic enough to move over to first base and hopefully make it look like I’ve played there for some years. Everybody knows I can play some defense and everyone knows I can hit. I’ve just had some unfortunate incidents in the last couple of years and I feel like I’m pretty close back to where I used to be. [Manager Terry Francona] just promised me plenty of at-bats and opportunities to prove I could be the player I want to be. That revolves around hitting.”\nMuch of the Red Sox roster was plagued by injuries during the 2010 season, forcing manager Francona to constantly juggle the lineups, filling the vacancies with whoever was available. Bill Hall became a \"super-utility\" option, and played all but two positions during the year. On May 28, 2010, Francona, facing a ninth inning with no available pitchers, sent Bill Hall to the mound. Hall's major league pitching debut was impressive: wielding nothing but an 89 mph fastball, he retired all three batters he faced. Hall finished his year in Boston with 18 home runs, leading the American League in home runs per at-bat in the final two months of the season.\n\nOn December 20, 2010, Hall signed a one-year contract with the Houston Astros. He was released on June 4, 2011, after hitting .224 for the Astros.\n\nHall signed with the San Francisco Giants on June 11, 2011. On July 28, 2011, Hall was designated for assignment by the Giants.\n\nHall signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees on February 7, 2012, with an invitation to spring training. He did not make the team, and opted out of his contract.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, Hall signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. On May 12, 2012, Hall was called up to the majors due to an injury to third baseman Mark Reynolds. Hall hit a home run in his Orioles debut against the Tampa Bay Rays. On May 25, Hall was designated for assignment by the Orioles. He hit 2-7 with a home run and 4 walks. On September 26, Hall's contract was purchased from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides after Randy Wolf was placed on the 60-day Disabled List.\n\nOn January 30, 2013, Hall signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim., but on May 19, 2013, was released after batting .164 over 21 games in AAA.\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Hall signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League.\n\nOn Thursday, September 5, 2019 Bill Hall signed a one-day contract and retired as a Milwaukee Brewer. “I was just a small town country boy with Major League dreams,” said Hall in a news release. “The Brewers gave me an opportunity to live those dreams. The organization and fans welcomed me like family, and that is what we became. Retiring as a Brewer could not feel better or happen any other way.”\n\nHall, along with former teammates J. J. Hardy, Jeff Suppan, and Chris Capuano, appeared in an episode of CBS' soap opera \"The Young and the Restless\". He served as a special playoff analyst on ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" following the 2006 season.\n\nBill Hall has three kids. Sydni Parker Hall, Maya Parker Hall, and Bella Parker Hall.\n"}

It is a potent chemical weapon, specifically a nettle agent. The compound itself is a colorless solid, but impure samples are often yellowish liquids. It has a strong, disagreeable odor and a violently irritating vapor.\n\nPhosgene oxime can be prepared by reduction of chloropicrin using a combination of tin metal and hydrochloric acid as the source of the active hydrogen reducing acent:\n\nThe observation of a transient violet color in the reaction suggests intermediate formation of trichloronitrosomethane (ClCNO). Early preparations, using stannous chloride as the reductant, also started with chloropicrin.\n\nThe compound is electrophilic and thus sensitive to nucleophiles, including base hydrolysis:\nSimilar processes provide an easy way to destroy this dangerous compound. Hydrazine converts it to HCN and N.\n\nPhosgene oxime is classified as a vesicant even though it does not produce blisters. It is toxic by inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. The effects of the poisoning occur almost immediately. No antidote for phosgene oxime poisoning is known. Generally, any treatment is supportive. Typical physical symptoms of CX exposure are as follows:\nPhosgene oxime is highly soluble in water. It is corrosive to metals and also decomposes on contact with metals. It is rapidly hydrolysed by alkaline solutions. Adsorbent powders such as Fuller's earth or talcum powder can also be used.\n\n"}
{"id": "2216522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216522", "title": "Administrative divisions of Massachusetts", "text": "Administrative divisions of Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts shares with the five other New England states a governmental structure known as the New England town. Only the southeastern third of the state has functioning county governments; in western, central, and northeastern Massachusetts, traditional county-level government was eliminated in the late 1990s. Generally speaking, there are four kinds of public school districts in Massachusetts: local schools, regional schools, vocational/technical schools, and charter schools.\n\nIn many other states, a town is a compact incorporated area; between the towns are unincorporated areas, usually quite large, that do not belong to any town. Such states are completely apportioned into counties, and county governments have significant importance, particularly to those living outside towns, and often perform major functions such as providing police and fire services and operating airports.\n\nIn contrast, all of the land in Massachusetts is divided up among the cities and towns and there are no \"unincorporated\" areas or population centers, nor townships. (This is generally true of most of the New England states, and is described at length at New England town.) This complicates comparisons with other non-New England states. The U.S. Census Bureau considers Massachusetts cities and towns to be minor civil divisions, equivalent to townships in other states, but townships usually have weaker forms of government. Many Massachusetts residents also identify with neighborhoods, villages, or other districts of their towns and cities.\n\nMany municipalities have their own police departments, as do many Massachusetts colleges and universities. Massachusetts State Police have sole authority under state law for investigating homicides, except for Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. Fire protection is generally also provided by municipal fire departments but may be divided among multiple smaller departments servicing just individual villages and population centers. Examples of multiple departments servicing the same towns include Dartmouth(three districts) and Barnstable(five districts, plus an airport department). Massport has its own fire department, and its Fire Rescue provides protection on agency property. Fire departments have mutual aid agreements, such as the Massachusetts Metro Fire District in Greater Boston, which facilitate emergency response across department boundaries.\n\nWater and sewer districts are generally operated at the municipal level, providing retail service to residential and business customers, and making provisions for sewage treatment and acquiring water from wells, rivers, or wholesaler. Some local water districts have been consolidated across municipal boundaries and some operate at the sub-municipal (village) level. Running water and sewer service is not necessarily available to all buildings, especially in low-density areas; building owners in these areas must obtain their own water and dispose of their own sewage. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority provides wholesale water and sewer services to many cities and towns, mostly in Greater Boston, in cooperation with DCR watershed land management. Combined sewers in some areas are being separated to reduce water pollution.\n\nState laws delegate limited control over building, alcohol, marijuana, gambling, and taxi licenses to municipal governments. Municipal governments own most roads, and many use police and traffic control officers to enforce their own parking regulations, and set speed limits and various restrictions on local roads within state parameters. Maintenance of state-owned roads (typically major), setting the rules of the road, driver and vehicle licenses, and public transportation are MassDOT responsibilities, though regional transportation agencies such as the MBTA are funded partly by fees paid by municipalities.\n\nMany Massachusetts towns were established during the British colonial period, long before the existence of an independent United States. The Massachusetts Constitution was written before the end of the American Revolution (1780). This constitution re-established the relationship between the state government and the towns which was originally specified by the charter which was granted to the Massachusetts Bay Company by King Charles I in 1629.\n\nAs in most of New England, the powers of Massachusetts cities and towns are set forth in the state constitution, state statutes, and municipal charters. However, the laws regulating their authority have historically been very broadly construed, and there is a long-standing tradition of local autonomy.\n\nIn 1966, the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution created a limited home rule mechanism explicitly granting certain powers to cities and towns. According to the Amendment:\n\nThe legislature is prohibited from passing any special laws that affect fewer than two municipalities, except in any of the following circumstances:\n\nMany municipalities seek approval for special legislation giving them desired powers, which may or may not be available to them under the blanket grant of Home Rule, due to potentially conflicting state laws. Even before the 1966 amendment, the laws regulating municipal powers had been very broadly construed, and there is a long-standing tradition of local autonomy.\n\nThe Zoning Act grants substantial zoning powers to municipalities. The Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law also concerns land use regulation.\n\nAs in most of New England, the distinction between a \"city\" and \"town\" as defined in Massachusetts law is primarily related to the form of government that the municipality has chosen. A town is governed under a town meeting form of government–either via an open town meeting or representative town meeting, with a board of selectmen handling town affairs between meetings. A city has a council or board of aldermen (and may or may not have a mayor, a city manager, or both). \n\nPrior to 1821, the only recognized form of government in Massachusetts was the town meeting. On April 9, 1821, an amendment to the state constitution was approved that permitted municipalities to choose other forms of government. On February 23, 1822, the Governor approved an act that granted a city form of government to Boston. The new charter for \"the City of Boston\" was drafted by Lemuel Shaw, later Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The voters of Boston approved the acceptance of the proposed city charter on March 4, 1822.\n\nThe state Constitution stipulates that any municipality that has a population under 12,000 cannot adopt \"city\" form of government and charter; any \"town\" with less than 6,000 population cannot adopt a representative town meeting charter and form of government. This applies whether or not the municipality has adopted a home rule charter. Other details of city and town government are left to the legislature.\n\nState law defines six possible options for city governments:\n\nThere are also certain operational differences between cities and towns. For instance, changes to town by-laws require approval by the Massachusetts Attorney General, but changes to city ordinances do not.\n\nA 1966 amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution affirmed the right of local municipalities to self-government and to the exercise of powers not inconsistent with state law. It also prohibited the state legislature from abolishing or combining cities and towns without their consent, and made it illegal for the legislature to enact legislation affecting only one municipality without that community's request or consent.\n\nAs part of the amendment, Massachusetts for the first time allowed cities and towns to draft and adopt their own home rule charters without receiving permission or approval from the state. The legislature adopted the state Home Rule Procedures Act to establish a process to accomplish the constitutional mandate.\n\nFor towns without a home rule charter, changes in the structure of the local government must be approved by petitioning the General Court for special legislation giving it that authority, or through adoption of one of the so-call Acceptance Act Charters, A through F. Communities with home rule charters must also request a Special Act in order to exercise a power the state has reserved to itself, such as increase the number of liquor licenses allowed in a city or town.\n\nAs of 2000, 71 municipalities had adopted home-rule charters under the Home Rule Amendment procedure, 13 operated under charters granted by Special Acts of the legislature passed before the Home Rule Amendment, and 19 operated under Special Acts pass after the Home Rule Amendment.\n\nOut of 53 cities in the Commonwealth, there are now eleven that are legally cities and have city councils, but retained \"Town of\" in their names. This distinction derives from provisions of state law that reference the town meeting form of government and that provide for greater self-governance authority for the class of communities governed by a form of chief executive and council which are referred to as cities in state law.\n\nCommunities adopting a city form while retaining \"Town of\" as their name are: Agawam, Amesbury, Barnstable, Braintree, Franklin, Greenfield, Palmer, Southbridge, Watertown, West Springfield, Weymouth, and Winthrop.\n\nLegal opinions provided to charter commissions in some of first of the 11 communities adopting a style of government that the General Laws referred to as a city form suggested that for clarity the community be referenced as \"the City Known as the Town of X\" as its legal name. The term \"town\" was retained in many cases because a suburban community did not desire to be known as a \"city\" with the urban issues the name implies, but wished to adopt the city form of government.\n\nHow a municipality refers to itself has been said to be a decision that is up to the community. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that what a municipality calls itself doesn't matter: \"It is the substance of the thing done, and not the name given to it, which controls\". Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, 229 Mass. 600 (Mass. 1918). The \"City known as the Town of\" reference was intended in communities adopting it to assert its right to exercise the authority of a city in governance, municipal finance and procurement. In the early days of the spread of the council-based municipal government to towns, it served to eliminate confusion as to a town's ability to do a particular thing.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the Home Rule Amendment, no town had become a city in Massachusetts for 45 years, while four made the change in the first 10 years following the adoption of home rule.\n\n\nPrimary and secondary school attendance is compulsory and free for Massachusetts residents aged 6–16. Massachusetts has a school choice law which allows students to attend a school in a district outside their municipality if the other district has space and approves. K-12 students may also attend private schools. Private schools are not state-funded and generally charge tuition. Many are parochial schools operated by subdivisions of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are four kinds of public school districts in Massachusetts: local schools, regional schools, vocational/technical schools, and charter schools.\n\nLocal schools are funded by one municipality. 50% of the municipalities in Massachusetts use local schools for grades Kindergarten through 12. Local schools are administered by the municipality through an elected or appointed school committee, and are considered a department of the city or town government. In some cities, such as Cambridge and Malden, the city charter specifies that the mayor has a permanent seat on the school committee. The capital city of Boston is subject to a special state law which allows the mayor to appoint a school committee of seven. The final budget control for local schools is held by the municipality (Mayor or Town Meeting, respectively), although the school committee receives an annual lump sum appropriation from the municipality, and \"town-side\" or \"city-side\" officials have no control over the allocation of School Department funds within the annual appropriation, which is controlled by the school committee.\n\nAny two or more municipalities may combine their public schools into one district and form regional schools. 27% of the municipalities in Massachusetts have K-12 regional schools, while many other communities are served by local primary Schools and regional secondary schools. Regional schools are administered by a school committee that consists of representatives of the municipalities in the region. Final budget control for a regional district is still held by the voters of its member municipalities, however. Participating mayors and Town Meetings still vote on the bottom line of their share of the regional budget. If municipalities within a school district disagree (e.g., if one town funds 100% of the regional school committee's request, and another funds only 75%), a second round of decisions is taken. If the disagreement persists, registered voters within the regional district's boundaries assemble for a \"district meeting,\" similar to a town meeting, at which a majority vote of attendees prevails. Each member city or town must then adjust its own budget to accommodate the voted assessments.\n\nSeveral regional school districts overlay the \"academic\" school district system and provide vocational and technical high schools for students from several communities. Vocational/technical schools are administered by a regional school committee. The structure of this committee is established in the regional agreement. Like any regional school committee, vocational committees have final budget control for school spending decisions, but still depend on local authorities for funding.\n\nCharter schools are publicly funded schools that are subject to different administrative structures from traditional public schools. There are two types of charter schools in Massachusetts. Massachusetts law specifies governance and entities eligible to apply for a charter, or operate a charter school as follows:\n\nCommonwealth Charter Schools were created as part of Education Reform in 1993. Commonwealth Charter Schools are formed by the approval of a charter that defines its administrative structure. Charter Schools are not subject to the collective bargaining agreements that are negotiated for other public schools. There are 51 Commonwealth Charter Schools in Massachusetts. Commonwealth Charter Schools are administered by a board of trustees of the private entity that received the charter authority to operate the school.\n\nHorace Mann Charter Schools were defined in 1997. The charter for these schools must be approved by the local school committee and the local union. There are 8 Horace Mann Charter Schools in Massachusetts. A Horace Mann Chater school is run operated and managed by a board of trustees independent of the school committees which approve said schools. The board of trustees may include a member of the school committee. The board of trustees may include a municipal school committee member.\n\nAll school districts in Massachusetts must employ a superintendent and business (or finance) manager. Many districts also have assistant or associate superintendents, pupil services directors, special education directors, and other administrators, although these are not required by state law. State law is developed into regulations by the Massachusetts Board of Education to govern local, regional, vocational, and charter schools.\n\nThe cost of operating public schools comes from two sources: local government, funded primarily by the property tax, and payments from the state Legislature (out of the state general fund), calculated to provide more aid to economically weaker school districts and thereby equalize educational opportunity across the state. These \"Chapter 70\" payments are in addition to separate local aid payments to town and city governments' general funds.\n\nCities and towns are required by state law to spend a minimum amount on education. This required amount is referred to as \"Net School Spending\" and is calculated as part of the Chapter 70 funding formula.\n\nEach school district is allocated a certain amount of funding through a foundational budget, which is based on the number of students that community is required to educate according to enrollment figures as of October 1 of the previous year, as well as the calculated wealth of a community. However, when a student transfers out of district to another public district, to a charter school, a public vocational school, etc., a certain amount of funding is transferred along with them.\n\nSchool construction and renovation projects fall under the budgetary and land use powers of the municipalities rather than the school boards.\n\nDistrict attorneys and sheriffs are elected by constituencies that mostly, but not entirely, follow county boundaries; they are funded by the state budget. Though most county governments have been abolished, each county still has a Sheriff's Department which operates jails and correctional facilities and service of process within the county.\n\nBy the 1990s, most functions of county governments (including operation of courts and road maintenance) had been taken over by the state, and most county governments were seen as inefficient and outmoded. The government of Suffolk County was substantially integrated with the city government of Boston more than one hundred years ago, to the extent that the members of the Boston city council are \"ex officio\" the Suffolk County Commissioners, and Boston's treasurer and auditor fulfill the same offices for the county. Thus, residents of the other three Suffolk County communities do not have a voice on the county commission, but all the county expenses are paid by the city of Boston.\n\nThe government of Nantucket County, which is geographically coterminous with the Town of Nantucket, is operated along similar lines — the town selectmen (executive branch) act as the county commissioners.\n\nMismanagement of Middlesex County's public hospital in the mid-1990s left that county on the brink of insolvency, and in 1997 the Massachusetts legislature stepped in by assuming all assets and obligations of the county. The government of Middlesex County was officially abolished on July 11, 1997. Later that year, the Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence. The law abolishing Middlesex County also provided for the elimination of Hampden County and Worcester County on July 1, 1998. This law was later amended to abolish Hampshire County on January 1, 1999; Essex County and Suffolk County on July 1 of that same year; and Berkshire County on July 1, 2000. Chapter 34B of the Massachusetts General Laws allows other counties either to abolish themselves, or to reorganize as a \"regional council of governments\", as Hampshire and Franklin Counties have done. The governments of Bristol, Plymouth, and Norfolk Counties remain substantially unchanged. Barnstable and Dukes Counties have adopted modern county charters, enabling them to act as efficient regional governments. Dukes County in particular has a strong regional planning agency known as the Martha's Vineyard Commission.\n"}

One of the oldest Metro stations, it was designed by Alexey Dushkin and Ya. Likhtenberg and opened in 1935 as part of the original Metro line.\n\nThe station was originally planned to serve the enormous Palace of the Soviets (Dvorets Sovetov), which was to rise nearby on the former site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Kropotkinskaya was therefore designed to be the largest and grandest station on the first line. However, the Palace project was cancelled by Nikita Khrushchev in 1953, leaving the Metro station as the only part of the complex that was actually built.\n\nKropotkinskaya was constructed in a massive open trench measuring long by wide. The tunnels from Biblioteka Imeni Lenina were constructed using the cut and cover technique. The combination of unrestricted space and dry soil made for ideal conditions, and construction of the station took only 180 days from start to finish. Kropotkinskaya was completed in January 1935 and opened five months later, on 15 May 1935. The station was named Dvorets Sovetov until 1957, when it was renamed in honour of Peter Kropotkin, a geographer, philosopher, and anarchist theoretician born in the vicinity.\n\nSince it was to serve as the gateway to the Palace of Soviets, great care was taken to make Kropotkinskaya suitably elegant and impressive. The station has flared columns faced with white marble which are said to have been inspired by the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Contrary to popular opinion, the marble used in the station did not come from the demolished Cathedral. The spacious platform is covered with squares of gray and red granite and the walls, originally tiled, are now faced with white \"Koyelga\" marble. The station is illuminated by concealed lamps set into the tops of the columns.\n\nA model of the station won two Grand Prix awards at expositions in Paris (1937) and Brussels (1958). In 1941 the designers and engineers were also awarded the Stalin prize of the USSR for architecture and construction.\n\nKropotkinskaya opened with only one entrance vestibule, located at the end of Gogolevskiy Boulevard. This U-shaped structure was designed by S.M. Kravets and features two separate pavilions joined by a central arch. In late 1950s the station was given a slight reconstruction replacing the original cast of the upper pillars was replaced by marble and the floor was relayed with granite. The reconstruction finished with a new entrance which faces the Cathedral and Moskva River which was opened on 16 July 1960.\n\nBecause of the demise of the Palace of Soviets project, much of Kropotkinskaya's planned ridership never materialized. the station serves about 42,050 passengers daily, many of them tourists visiting the newly rebuilt Cathedral or the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nBy 2020, a transfer to the Kalininskaya Line is planned to open. The future station will be called Volkhonka.\n"}

Based on the fantasy film \"Labyrinth\", it tasks the player with navigating a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. The player's goal is to find and defeat the main antagonist, Jareth, within 13 real-time hours. Unlike other adventure games of the period, \"Labyrinth\" does not feature a command-line interface. Instead, the player uses two scrolling \"word wheel\" menus on the screen to construct basic sentences.\n\n\"Labyrinth\" was the first adventure game created by Lucasfilm. The project was led by designer David Fox, who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text-based adventure games. Early in development, the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week-long series of brainstorming sessions, which inspired much of the final product. \"Labyrinth\" received positive reviews and, in the United States, was a bigger commercial success than the film upon which it was based. Its design influenced Lucasfilm's subsequent adventure title, the critically acclaimed \"Maniac Mansion\".\n\n\"Labyrinth: The Computer Game\" is a graphic adventure game in which the player maneuvers a character through a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. It is an adaptation of the 1986 film \"Labyrinth\", many of whose events and characters are reproduced in the game. However, it does not follow the plot of the film. At the beginning, the player enters their name, sex and favorite color: the last two fields determine the appearance of the player character. Afterward, a short text-based adventure sequence unfolds, wherein the player enters a movie theater to watch the film \"Labyrinth\". The game then changes to a graphic adventure format. Jareth, the main antagonist, appears on the projection screen and transports the protagonist to a labyrinthine prison.\n\nThe player's goal is to locate and destroy Jareth within 13 real-time hours; otherwise, the protagonist will be trapped in the maze forever. While traveling the maze, the player passes through a series of scrolling hallways that contain doors, enemies and other things. A \"radar\" bar on the screen allows the player to see each hallway in miniature form: the locations of all doorways, items and characters in a given hallway are displayed. Unlike other adventure games of the period, \"Labyrinth\" does not feature a command-line interface. Instead of typing commands, the player selects them from two scrolling \"word wheels\", one for verbs and one for nouns. For example, the verb \"congratulate\" may be selected in one wheel, and the noun \"Jareth\" in the other: this inputs the command \"congratulate Jareth\". Based on the player's items and location, the available verbs and nouns change context-sensitively.\n\nLucasfilm Games began to design \"Labyrinth: The Computer Game\" in 1985. Company head George Lucas had requested a tie-in video game for the movie of the same name, which was under production at Lucasfilm. As was common with Lucasfilm Games projects, Lucas himself provided very little direction to the team. \"Labyrinth\" was the first licensed game developed by the company: earlier products, such as \"Rescue on Fractalus!\" and \"The Eidolon\", had been original intellectual properties. According to project leader David Fox, working with a license \"frees you up in some ways and restricts you, too\". With their adaptation, the team was not pressured to reuse events and characters from the \"Labyrinth\" film; but they \"felt obligated\" to follow the source material. Because they saw the film as an adventure story, they chose to set their adaptation in the adventure game genre. However, Fox disliked the genre's then-reliance on text parsers and syntax guessing, and so he created the word wheel menus as a replacement. They were meant to supply \"a limited set of words that still let you do a lot of things\", in order to streamline the game without hampering the player's freedom. The game's visual design was shared by Lucasfilm's \"Habitat\", a massively multiplayer online game under production at the time.\n\nEarly in development, the game's team was screened a rough cut of the film. Afterward, they were sent to London by Lucasfilm management for a one-week brainstorming session with Douglas Adams, author of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Adams had worked previously with Infocom, during the development of his book's 1984 video game adaptation. Also present at the meetings were writer Christopher Cerf (a friend of the film's director, Jim Henson) and Brenda Laurel of Activision, the game's publisher. The team worked extensively with Adams during this period. Laurel later wrote, \"Every day a fresh blast of his wild and intelligent humor stoked up the creativity of the team.\" In her view, the pinnacle of the meetings was Adams' idea for the opening sequence. He suggested a reference to \"The Wizard of Oz\"s famous transition from black-and-white to color: a transition from a text-based format to a graphical one.\n\nFox was given the job of taking notes during the trip. Although he had hoped for a complete design to emerge from the meetings, he returned from London with only \"sheets and sheets of ideas\", through which he sifted to find usable concepts. However, all of the material influenced the game, and many of Adams' suggestions were used. Retrospectively, Fox felt that the opening sequence was a mistake: he called it \"tedious\" and believed that it alienated potential fans. \"Labyrinth\" was released in 1986 for the Commodore 64, Apple II and MSX.\n\nIn the United States, \"Labyrinth\" was more commercially successful than the film upon which it was based. \"Commodore Magazine\"s Mark Cotone lauded the game's puzzle design, detailed graphics and newcomer-friendly interface. He believed that experienced players would enjoy its depth and challenging puzzles. Keith Campbell of \"Commodore User\" praised its animation and dubbed it \"a superb game\"—which he found unusual, given its status as a tie-in product. However, Campbell hesitated to call it an adventure game, and he wrote that the word wheels were \"rather tedious\" for genre veterans. Roy Wagner of \"Computer Gaming World\" summarized \"Labyrinth\" as a \"very well done [game] with an excellent user interface\".\n\nWriting for \"Computer & Video Games\", Matthew Woodley praised the game's variety and interface. While he disliked its long loading times, he believed that they were \"a small price to pay for such a brilliant game\". However, \"Labyrinth\" was criticized by the three reviewers of \"Zzap!64\". Although he praised its visuals, co-reviewer Paul Sumner called the game too slow-paced for an action title and too simplistic for an adventure. Co-reviewer Julian Rignall considered it to be boring and \"a real disappointment\", given Lucasfilm's strong track record.\n\n\"Labyrinth\" was the first adventure game produced by Lucasfilm, which became a critically acclaimed and commercially successful developer in the genre. The game's technology and mechanics influenced the company's subsequent title \"Maniac Mansion\", whose \"SCUMM\" engine was reused in many Lucasfilm adventure games. The word wheels were a predecessor to that game's point-and-click interface. Gary Winnick, an artist for \"Labyrinth\", went on to lead the production of \"Maniac Mansion\" with Ron Gilbert. Fox contributed to \"Maniac Mansion\" as well, and he later directed Lucasfilm's \"Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders\". Retrospectively, writers for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation regarded \"Labyrinth\" as a solid first attempt, but as inferior to \"the real classics\" made afterward by Lucasfilm.\n\n"}
{"id": "2216541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216541", "title": "Pretties for You", "text": "Pretties for You\n\nPretties for You is the debut studio album by American rock band Alice Cooper, released on June 25, 1969 by Straight Records. At this time, the name \"Alice Cooper\" referred to the band and not its lead singer Vincent Furnier, although he was also known as Alice Cooper. The album has a psychedelic flavor to it; the group had yet to develop the more concise hard rock sound that they would become famous for. Most of the tracks feature unusual time signatures and arrangements, jarring syncopation, expressive dynamics, sound effects, and an eclectic range of music influences. A few songs, such as \"Levity Ball\", show the influence of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, with whom the band hung out during the British group's U.S. tour. Alice Cooper guitarist Glen Buxton stated he could listen to Barrett's guitar playing for hours on end.\n\nThe artwork for this album is a painting by Edward Beardsley. It was originally hanging on the wall of the living room in Frank Zappa's house, and his wife Gail Zappa stated that it was later stolen from them.\n\n\"Pretties for You\" was a critical and commercial failure, only briefly appearing on the \"Billboard\" Top 200, and none of its songs have ever been played live by Cooper since the release of the band's breakthrough album \"Love It to Death\". The song \"Reflected\", Alice Cooper's first single, was later rewritten as \"Elected\", which features on their 1973 album \"Billion Dollar Babies\".\n\nAccording to Alice Cooper's band manager Shep Gordon, when recording at Whitney Studios in Burbank, Frank Zappa left his brother in charge of recording while Zappa left the studio. Zappa returned later that day and informed them the album was finished, having only recorded the band rehearsing. Gordon states that there was no producer during recording, that the band had no complete songs written, that Zappa \"didn't spend 5 minutes in the studio\" and never asked to hear their material, and that the band's debut album was made up entirely of that rehearsal recording, aside from the live recording of \"Levity Ball\".\n\nAll songs written by Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith.\n\n\n\nLester Bangs of \"Rolling Stone\" felt that there were no \"[hints] of life, spontaneity, joy, rage, or any kind of authentic passion or conviction\". However, he stated that \"within the context of [Alice Cooper's] self-imposed limitations, the album is listenable\". He concluded the review by saying that \"Alice Cooper's music is, for this reviewer at any rate, totally dispensable\".\n\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine feels that the album \"was an earnest but flawed stab at psychedelia that occasionally caught fire\".\n\nOn November 8, 2015, the entire record was performed live at The Stone in NYC as part of Nick Didkovsky's residency there. Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway and Cindy Smith Dunaway were in attendance. Dennis Dunaway joined the band for \"Nobody Likes Me\" as an encore, a song that was originally slated to be on the record.\n\n"}
{"id": "2216552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216552", "title": "IRT Nostrand Avenue Line", "text": "IRT Nostrand Avenue Line\n\nThe IRT Nostrand Avenue Line is a rapid transit line of the IRT division of the New York City Subway running under Nostrand Avenue in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is served at all times by the ' train, and is also served by the ' train on weekdays during the daytime.\n\nThe Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were \"dual\" in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The line was supposed to extend to Coney Island. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. In September 1917, the line was projected to open at the end of 1918. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920 at 12:40 AM.\n\nThe line was planned to be extended to Marine Park, Brooklyn (at what is now Kings Plaza) under either Utica Avenue, using a brand-new line, or Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, using the then-new IRT Nostrand Avenue Line as part of the Dual Contacts There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to Sheepshead Bay.\n\nIn January 1919, the Public Service Commission decided that the Nostrand Avenue Line should be extended to Coney Island using the Manhattan Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The extension would have meant that passengers wishing to get to Coney Island would not have to pay the double fare that was required to get there via the Brooklyn Rapid Transit lines. Previously, the construction of a yard south of Flatbush Avenue was considered, and the yard could be built in conjunction with the new extension. The Manhattan Beach Branch would have had to been electrified. The connection was estimated to cost $250,000. Two additional tracks would have been built along the Manhattan Beach right-of-way so that the other tracks could be used for freight. With the additional costs of the tracks the project would have cost $950,000.\n\nThe Nostrand Avenue line was planned to be extended in 1929 as part of the IND Second System. The line would have been extended as a subway to Kings Highway, and then as an elevated line to Avenue S at the cost of $7.4 million. South of Avenue S the line would continue to Voohries Avenue on a four-track structure shared with the proposed Utica Avenue Line for $3.2 million.\n\nIn 1939, the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line was planned to be extended to Voorhies Avenue in Sheepshead Bay as a subway to Avenue T and an elevated from there to Voorhies Avenue. In 1946, the New York City Board of Transportation issued a $1billion plan to extend subway service to the farthest reaches of the outer boroughs, and as part of the plan the line was again projected to extend to Voorhies Avenue.\n\nOn September 13, 1951, the Board of Estimate approved a plan put forth by the Board of Transportation that would cost $500 million. As part of the plan the Nostrand Avenue Line was to be extended to Voorhies Avenue in Sheepshead Bay.\n\nIn March 1954, the Transit Authority issued a $658 million construction program including the extension of the Nostrand Avenue Line to Avenue U, which would have cost $51.7 million.\n\nThe Nostrand Avenue Line was once again slated to be extended further south in 1968 as part of the newly created Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Program for Action. This was to have been several extensions to serve the then-burgeoning areas of Mill Basin and Spring Creek. The Rogers Junction on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line was a serious traffic bottleneck during the rush hours due to the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line tracks' at-grade junctions with the bi-level IRT Eastern Parkway Line. The Rogers Junction would have to be reconstructed with flying junctions to increase capacity for several extensions. The initial plan had the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line would be extended past Flatbush Avenue – Brooklyn College along Flatbush Avenue to a new modern terminal at Avenue U at Kings Plaza. This extension was projected to cost $60 million. Other plans had the line extended along Nostrand Avenue from Avenue H, where the exiting tunnel ends, to Sheepshead Bay at Avenue W or Voorhies Avenue; this second plan had been proposed as part of the line's original construction. The Nostrand Avenue plan, Route 29–C, which was approved by the Board of Estimate on June 3, 1969, would have had three stations added at Kings Highway, Avenue R, and Avenue W, with a storage yard constructed south of Avenue W. The construction of either extension would have reduced delays and improved operational efficiency because Flatbush Avenue would not need to be a terminal any longer.\n\nIn the summer of 1972, the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line extension to Avenue W was being designed. By November 1974, the MTA projected that by 1993, the Nostrand Avenue extension would be open. Due to the 1975–76 fiscal crisis that affected the city, most of the remaining projects did not have funding, so they were declined. Expected to be completed by the mid-1970s and early 1980s, lines for the Program for Action had to be reduced or canceled altogether due to the 1970s fiscal crisis.\n\nIn 1968, and again in 1989, the MTA gave consideration to extending the Nostrand Avenue Line approximately beyond the Flatbush Avenue station to provide room for turnaround facilities to eliminate the operational restrictions caused by the current layout.\n\nIn October 2008, the Regional Plan Association in the report Tomorrow's Transit suggested that the Nostrand Avenue Line be extended two stops to Kings Highway as a way to improve travel times and reliability for subway service on the Brooklyn IRT.\n\nIn August 2016, it was reported that the MTA was looking into an extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line along Flatbush Avenue to Marine Park, which would allow trains to serve Kings Plaza.\n\nAll services serve the entire line and make all stops.\n\nThe two tracks split off from the local tracks of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and diverge away in the vicinity of Rogers Avenue at the Rogers Avenue Junction, turning south onto Nostrand Avenue to/from the Nostrand Avenue Line. Running beneath Nostrand Avenue, the line serves the neighborhoods of southern Crown Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Flatbush, East Flatbush, and the Brooklyn College area. The line's final station is Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College, where there is an unusual terminal setup. It is the only terminal station in the subway system at the end of a physical line that does not have an island platform, and it was built with two side platforms and two tracks to allow for a planned, but not carried out extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line south towards Voorhies Avenue in Sheepshead Bay. The platforms are connected at the south end just past the bumper blocks (forming a \"U\" shape), mitigating what is otherwise an inefficient terminal design. This terminal setup is inefficient, and combined with the Rogers Avenue Junction's also-inefficient design (see below), this limits capacity on the line. Therefore, some rush hour ' and ' trains run via the IRT New Lots Line.\n\nThe IRT Nostrand Avenue Line tunnels continue beyond the bumper blocks at Flatbush Avenue and Nostrand Avenue. They extend for several hundred feet to Avenue H. Up until about 2006, you could see the cemented over gratings extending down Nostrand Avenue. When a new building went up, the grates were removed. Prior to the building of the exit at the south end of the station, there was only a temporary wooden ramp connecting the platforms and the tunnels were actually visible to passengers.\n\nAnother factor limiting capacity on the line is the set up of the Rogers Avenue Junction, where trains can diverge from the IRT Eastern Parkway Line to the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line or continue on Eastern Parkway. Rogers Avenue Junction was built when the Nostrand Avenue Line was built, and it only connected the IRT Eastern Parkway Line local tracks to the Nostrand Avenue Line. From west to east between the Franklin Avenue station and the junction, the northbound local track descends to a lower level directly below the southbound local track. Then, the northbound express track, which is still on the upper level at this point, descends to the lower level directly below the southbound express track, creating a dual level two-over-two track layout.\n\nAt the junction, a switch on the upper level allows southbound 5 express trains to change to the local track, and a corresponding switch on the lower level allows 5 trains on the northbound local track to change to the express track. Directly to the east, all of the mainline tracks shift slightly to the north, and the mainline local tracks on both levels become the Nostrand Avenue Line tracks, which turn to the south. There is a closed tower at the south end of the southbound platform.\n\nThis junction is a severe traffic bottleneck during rush hours, and rebuilding it would require massive construction including the tearing up of Eastern Parkway. In 1968, as part of the Program for Action, a rebuilding of the junction was planned in order to alleviate congestion. However, financial troubles caused the plan to be dropped.\n"}

An Armenian Genocide survivor, he moved to France from an orphanage in Lebanon in 1925. He was active in communist Armenian literary circles. During World War II, he became the military commissioner of FTP-MOI, a group consisting of European immigrants, including many Jews, in the Paris region which carried out assassinations and bombings of Nazi targets. According to one author, the Manouchian group was the most active French Resistance group. Manouchian and many of his comrades were arrested in November 1943 and executed by the Nazis in Fort Mont-Valérien on 21 February 1944. He is considered a hero of the French Resistance.\n\nManouchian was born on 1 September 1906 in Adıyaman, in Mamuret-ul-Aziz Vilayet, Ottoman Empire into an Armenian peasant family. His parents were killed during the Armenian Genocide of 1915, but he and his brother managed to survive. In the early 1920s he settled in an Armenian General Benevolent Union-run orphanage in Jounieh, Lebanon, then a French protectorate. He acquired education there and in 1925 moved to France.\n\nEventually, Manouchian settled in Paris, where he took a job as a lathe operator at a Citroën plant. During this period he was self-educated and often visited libraries in the Latin Quarter. He joined the General Confederation of Labour (\"Confédération Générale du Travail\", CGT), a national association of trade unions which was the first of the five major French confederations. In the early 1930s, when the world-wide economic crisis of the Great Depression set in, Missak Manouchian lost his job. Disaffected with capitalism, he began earning a meager living by posing as a model for sculptors.\n\nIn 1934, Manouchian joined the French Communist Party. From 1935 to 1937 he edited the Armenian-language left-wing weekly newspaper \"Zangou\", named after a river in Armenia. The newspaper was anti-fascist, anti-Dashnak, anti-imperialist and pro-Soviet.\n\nManouchian wrote poetry and, with an Armenian friend who used the pseudonym of Séma (Kégham Atmadjian), founded two communist-leaning literary magazines, \"Tchank\" (\"Effort\") and \"Mechagouyt\" (\"Culture\"). They published articles on French literature and Armenian culture. The two young men translated the poetry of Baudelaire, Verlaine, and Rimbaud into Armenian, making many of these works available in Armenian for the first time. Both Manouchian and Séma enrolled at the Sorbonne to audit courses in literature, philosophy, economics, and history.\n\nThe following year, he was elected secretary of the Relief Committee for Armenia (HOC), an organization associated with the MOI (Immigrant Workforce Movement). At a meeting of the HOC in 1935, he met Mélinée Assadourian, who became his companion and, later, his wife.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out in September 1939 Manouchian, as a foreigner, was evacuated from Paris. He found work in the Rouen area, again as a lathe-operator. After the defeat of June 1940, he returned to Paris to find that his militant activities had become illegal. (French authorities had banned the Communist Party as early as September 1939.) On 22 June 1941, when the invasion of the Soviet Union by the Nazis began, Manouchian was arrested by the occupying Germans in an anti-communist round-up in Paris. Interned in a prison camp at Compiègne, by the efforts of his wife Mélinée Assadourian, he was released after a few weeks without being charged.\n\nManouchian became the political chief of the Armenian section of the underground MOI, but little is known about his activities until 1943. In February of that year, Manouchian transferred to the FTP-MOI, a group of gunmen and saboteurs attached to the MOI in Paris.\n\nManouchian became the leader of the FTP-MOI in June/August 1943, replacing Boris Holban (). Manouchian assumed command of three detachments, totaling about 50 fighters. The Manouchian group is credited with the assassination on 28 September 1943, of General , the assistant in France to Fritz Sauckel, responsible for the mobilization and deportation of labor under the German STO (Obligatory Work Service) in Nazi-occupied Europe. (The attack was made by the partisans Marcel Rayman, , and Celestino Alfonso.) The Manouchian groups carried out almost thirty successful attacks on German interests from August to November 1943. Charles Aznavour and his family were members of the Manouchian resistance group, and were recognized after the war for rescuing Jews and Armenians from Nazi persecution. \n\nOn 16 November 1943 the collaborationist French police forces arrested the Manouchian group at Évry-Petit Bourg. His companion, Mélinée, managed to escape the police.\n\nManouchian and the others were tortured to gain information, and eventually handed over to the Germans' Geheime Feldpolizei (GFP). The 23 were given a 1944 show trial for propaganda purposes before execution. Manouchian and 21 of his comrades were shot at Fort Mont-Valérien near Paris on 21 February 1944.\n\nIn his last letter to his widow, Mélinée, Manouchian said that he forgave everyone except \"the one who betrayed us to save his skin and those who sold us.\" \"There was consensus that they were betrayed by one of their number, Joseph Davidovitch (), who was arrested and tortured by the Nazis (before being released and shot by the Resistance). But some survivors also felt the French Communist Party had sacrificed the unit by refusing to smuggle vital Jewish combatants out of Paris after the French police began to tail them.\"\n\nIn December 2009, photographs of French Resistance agents facing the firing squad of Nazi officers were discovered. Serge Klarsfeld identified those killed as Manouchian and his group members. The photographs began being permanently exhibited at Fort Mont-Valérien in June 2010.\n\nFollowing World War II, Armenians were perceived in France positively \"solely in the reﬂective light of Missak Manouchian, who played an important role in the French anti-Nazi resistance.\" Manouchian is a prominent figure in the bilateral relations between Armenia and France. In 2007, an exhibition dedicated to Manouchian was held at the Musée Jean Moulin in Paris in the scope of the Year of Armenia in France. On 21 February 2014, on the 70th anniversary of the execution of Manouchian and his group, a commemoration ceremony was held at Fort Mont-Valérien. Notable attendees included French President François Hollande, Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan and prominent French-Armenian singer Charles Aznavour. On 13 March 2014, the Missak Manouchian Park was opened in central Yerevan, the Armenian capital, in attendance of Presidents Serzh Sargsyan and Hollande.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, a street named for the Manouchian Group (\"\") was dedicated in the 20th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nIn 1978, a statue of Manouchian sculpted by Ara Harutyunyan was opened in the military cemetery of Ivry-sur-Seine, Paris.\n\nA commemorative plaque was installed on 22 February 2009 at 11 rue de Plaisance, in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. The old hotel at this address was the last home shared by Manouchian and his wife, Mélinée.\n\nIn February 2010, busts of Manouchian were inaugurated in a Marseille, in a square named after him, and in Issy-les-Moulineaux.\n\nDue to his communist ideology, Manouchian was immediately recognized as a hero in the Soviet Union. Soviet Armenian author Marietta Shaginyan described him as an \"example of an Armenian who preserved his nationality, and at the same time became a class-conscious worker and a militant communist in his adopted country.\" Russian poet Sergei Shervinsky hailed him in a 1956 \"Ogoniok\" article as a \"Fighter, Worker, Poet\". A school in Yerevan, Armenia—founded in 1947—was named for Manouchian in 1963.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is on the Sokolnicheskaya line, between Frunzenskaya and Kropotkinskaya stations. Named after the nearby Maxim Gorky Park of Culture and Leisure located across the Moskva River.\n\nThe station was designed by Nikolai Kolli and opened on 15 May 1935, along with the first phase of the Moscow Metro.\n\nThe construction of the station began in the spring of 1933. From the start it was clear that construction of this final station would not be an easy task. Being only several hundred metres from the bank of the Moskva River, the soil was particularly damp, with the level of subterranean waters being higher than the future ceiling of the station.\n\nEven more important was the fact that the station is situated under the Crimean Square (Krymskaya Ploshchad) of the Garden Ring's intersection with the southwestern Ostozhenka Street/Komsomolsky Avenue and thus being an important traffic hub. Before the pit of the station was excavated along its future perimeter, metallic casts reinforced by solid logs with caulked slits between them were forced into the ground, and abyssal water lowering was employed as the pit was slowly excavated to its required depth. All of this was necessary to prevent the flooding of the pit, which was likely to have caused subsidence and even destruction of nearby houses. As soon as that work was completed, a wooden bridge was erected at street level to prevent traffic disruption. Most of the construction was carried out at night. The station was completed in eleven months during which time 100,000 cubic metres of soil was removed from the pit and replaced with 25,000 cubic metres of concrete.\nThe station is a bi-level pillar-trispan with four footbridges above the platforms. Architects Krutikov and Popov chose a decoration inspired by ancient Greek elements. Along the platform, two rows of 22 pillars are faced with Crimean marble \"Kadykovka\" and topped with moulded сapitals. Along the walls a set of dark rose-coloured mosaic pilasters repeat the step of the pillars (every seven metres), blending very well with the porcelain tiles that face the rest of the wall area. Also, a dark-brown mosaic socle runs below the platform level along both walls. A total of 1500 square meters of marble, and 200 square metres of porcelain tiles, were used in the decorations.\n\nThe footbridges which lead to the vestibules are separately decorated with red metalloplastic tiles and moulded white balustrades with marbled railings. The walls of the corridors leading to the vestibules are revetted with white uralian \"koelga\" marble. \n\nThe station originally had two vestibules, one of which, a distinctive rotunda building, still stands on the corner between Ostozhenka street and Novokrymskiy side-street. The second vestibule used to stand on the corner of Komsmolskiy Avenue and Sadovoye Koltso. The ticket hall was faced with brown Ural \"ufaley\" marble and had four welded octagonal columns faced with white \"koelga\" marble. The ticket offices themselves were built out of polished oak. This vestibule was pulled down in 1949 when a larger vestibule was erected in its place, and the old corridors were integrated into it. The vestibule also offers a transfer to the Koltsevaya line, which was opened in 1950.\n\nThis station is one of the few surviving from the first stage that have remained more or less unchanged since their opening (compared with Lubyanka or Chistiye Prudy), except for the resurfacing the platform with granite (instead of original asphalt) and the installation of new lighting. The latter consisted of beautiful chandeliers in the central span and semi-circular lamps made of milk-white glass in side naves. However, with the introduction of luminescent lamps, the chandeliers and the lamps in the naves were completely removed. Despite that, the new lighting installations managed to fit in with the architectural composition and do not appear out of place, like on Kiyevskaya which had an analogous makeover.\n\nWhen the station opened in 1935, it was also the terminus of the Frunze Branch of the first stage (and from 1938, of Kirovsko–Frunzenskaya line). Although the plans called for the station to have a four-track reversal siding, that was not finished until 1937, and a temporary piston junction was instead installed before the platform to allow reversal of the trains. The station ceased to be the terminus in 1957, with the extension of the Frunzenskiy radius southwestward to Sportivnaya.\n\nWhen the station was opened, it had quite a long name: Tsentralnyi Park Kultury i Otdykha imeni Gorkovo (The Maxim Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure). However, even on the plans it was abbreviated as TsPKiO and only voice announcements used the full name. In 1980, with the holding of the Olympic Games in Moscow, the name was shortened to avoid lengthy trilingual station announcements, although some signs still bear the original long version of the name.\n\nThe station is used by 107,700 people daily, mainly passengers changing to and from Park Kultury on the Circle line, with only 9,650 passengers entering and leaving the Metro system at the station.\n\nOn March 29, 2010, the station, along with Lubyanka, was subject to a terrorist attack, resulting in 40 casualties.\n"}

At that time, a notable missionary teacher by the name of Mr William Earnest Donnelly, was serving as principal of Toorak Boys’ School. Whilst other overseas teachers immediately left Fiji to await the end of the war, the determined missionary principal, Mr Donnelly sent a circular to all members of the senior classes of Classes Six, Seven, and Eight of Toorak Boys School, inviting volunteers to come away with him, to continue their education. After consultation with the heads of the Methodist Church, he was given permission to use the principal’s residence at the Davuilevu Technical School. As a result, he and 50 volunteers from Toorak Boys School in Suva, met at the principal’s residence on 3 March 1943. Their first classrooms were the two master bedrooms in the house and the long verandah on the eastern side as their library. There were only two classes and two teachers; the late Mssrs W.E Donnelly and Semesa Sikivou.\n\nIn the 1943 Methodist Church Annual Conference, Mr Donnelly was given permission to expand his classes along the same ridge and as a result, the boys themselves, with his and Semesa Sikivou's guidance, built three large bures, where the teachers staff quarters presently stand. He was also directed to name the new school, Lelean Memorial School, in memory of a long serving and beloved missionary in Fiji, the Reverend Charles Oswald Lelean. Rev Lelean was an Australian missionary who served in Fiji for 36 years, from 1914 to 1934.\n\nAmongst his students were Rusiate Nayacakalou, who later became the first South Pacific Islander to graduate with a PhD and Jimione Samisoni who became the first Fijian to become the dean of the Fiji School of Medicine.\n\nSikivou served as a member of the Legislative Council in the 1960s, and in January 1963 he was one of eight to sign the Wakaya Letter, which affirmed the principles of Fijian paramountcy. When Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1970, he was appointed Fiji's first Ambassador to the United Nations, serving until 1976. He reentered politics in the 1980s, and served as Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn the 1972 New Year Honours List is was appointed a CBE. \n\nSikivou was offered a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, but declined it, saying that it was his honour to serve her without remuneration.\n\nSikivou, who hailed from Rewa Province, belonged to the tribe of the Roko Tui Dreketi's \"Guardians of the Spirit and the Wise Counsel,\" and as such was a member of the traditional court of the Paramount Chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy. He had strong ties to the Provinces of Namosi, Naitasiri, and Verata.\n\nHe was married twice, first to Seini Ratuvou of the Vutia District of Rewa, with whom he had one daughter, Ateca (who died of asthma at the age of one) and three sons: Navitalai, Rokocanini, and Metuisela Sikivou. His second marriage was to Salote Tabuanitoga of Kadavu Island. With her he had two sons: Jese and Mosese, and a daughter, Vasiti Sikivou-Waqa.\n"}

He is a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL).\n\nWalz was the U.S. Representative for from 2007 to 2019. The district comprises the state's southern end, running along the entire border with Iowa; it includes Rochester, Austin, Winona and Mankato. He was first elected in 2006, defeating six-term Republican incumbent Gil Gutknecht. He was reelected five times and served on the Agriculture Committee, Armed Services Committee and Veterans' Affairs Committee. Walz also served on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.\n\nIn March 2017 Walz announced that he would not run for reelection to Congress and instead run for Governor of Minnesota. On November 6, 2018, Walz was elected to the governorship, defeating the Republican nominee, Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson.\n\nWalz was born in West Point, Nebraska, the son of Darlene R. and James F. \"Jim\" Walz. He is of German, Irish, and Swedish ancestry. The son of a public school administrator and community activist, Walz was raised in Chadron, Nebraska, a rural community in the northwestern portion of the state.\n\nWalz graduated from Butte High School in a class of 25 students, and went on to earn a bachelor of science degree in social science education from Chadron State College. Walz's first teaching experience was at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He then accepted a teaching position with WorldTeach in the People's Republic of China.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981, and served over a 24-year career. In 1989, he earned the title of Nebraska Citizen-Soldier of the Year. After a deployment to Italy with his Guard unit, Walz was conditionally promoted to command sergeant major. Walz chose to retire before his most recent six-year enlistment was complete when his unit received orders to deploy to Iraq. Since Walz did not complete his promotion conditions, his rank was changed back to master sergeant after he left the service. He resumed teaching as a geography teacher and football coach at Mankato West High School.\n\nWalz and his wife, Gwen, ran Educational Travel Adventures, accompanying high school juniors and seniors on summer educational trips to China.\n\nWalz decided to run for Congress in 2006. He had no opponent for the DFL nomination in the September 12, 2006 primary election. He beat incumbent Republican Gil Gutknecht in the general election on November 7, and took office on January 3, 2007. After the election, Gutknecht was described as having been caught \"off guard\" and Walz as having \"resolved never to get caught like that himself. … He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans.\"\n\nWalz was reelected in 2008 with 62% of the vote, becoming only the second non-Republican to win a second full term in the district. He won a third term in 2010, defeating State Representative Randy Demmer with 50% of the vote. He was reelected in 2012, 2014, and 2016.\n\nDuring his 2018 campaign for governor, two senior NCOs of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of fabricating facts about his service and lying about his military rank. The allegations were debunked.\n\nUpon his swearing in, Walz became the highest-ranking retired enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress, as well as only the fourth Democrat/DFLer to represent his district. The others were Thomas Wilson (1887–89), William Harries (1891–93), and Tim Penny (1983–95).\n\nWalz served on the House Agriculture Committee, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the Armed Services Committee. Along with fellow Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison, Walz opposed President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. In his first week as a legislator, Walz cosponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage, voted for stem cell research, voted to allow Medicare to negotiate pharmaceutical prices, and voiced support for pay-as-you-go budget rules, requiring that new spending or tax changes not add to the federal deficit.\n\nRepresenting a district that has traditionally voted Republican, Walz cast votes ranging from moderate to liberal. He voted against the act to Prohibit Federally Funded Abortion Services, and voted to advance the Affordable Care Act out of the House. He has also voted to continue funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and against the 2008 TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from financial institutions.\n\nWalz received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood in 2012, from the ACLU in 2011, from the American Immigration Lawyers Association in 2009–10, from the AFL-CIO in 2010, from the Teamsters in 2009–10, and from NOW in 2007. He also received single-digit ratings from the National Taxpayers' Union, Citizens against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform, and Freedom Works. The US Chamber of Commerce gave him a 25% rating in 2010. Walz was ranked the 7th most bipartisan member of the House during the 114th Congress (and the most bipartisan member from Minnesota) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of Congress by measuring how often their bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and how often they co-sponsor bills by members of the opposite party.\n\nHaving served 24 years in the Army National Guard, as a freshman in Congress he was given a rare third committee membership when he was assigned to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Walz has championed enhanced veterans benefits since taking office in 2007. In May of that year the House unanimously passed his \"Traumatic Brain Injuries Center Act\" to set up five centers around the nation to study traumatic brain injuries and develop improved models for caring for veterans suffering from such injuries.\n\nWalz also supported the GI Bill of 2008, which expanded education benefits for veterans and in some cases allowed them to transfer education benefits to family members. In 2009, Walz gave the keynote address at the American Legion National Convention in Louisville, KY. He spoke about the need for the VA and Department of Defense to work together to make sure that returning service men and women \"do not fall through the cracks when they transition to civilian life\".\n\nWalz was the lead House sponsor of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which directs the Veterans Administration to report on veteran mental health care and suicide prevention programs. It also gives the VA permission to provide incentives to psychiatrists who agree to join the VA medical system.\n\nDuring 2008, Walz repeatedly spoke out against using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions; in late September he voted against the $700 billion TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from these institutions. Walz released a statement after the bill's passage, saying, \"The bill we voted on today passes the buck when it comes to recouping the losses taxpayers might suffer. I also regret that this bill does not do enough to help average homeowners, or provide sufficient oversight of Wall Street.\" For the same reasons, in December 2008 he voted against the bill that offered $14 billion in government loans to bail out the country's large automobile manufacturers. In June 2009 Walz introduced a bipartisan resolution calling on the federal government to \"relinquish its temporary ownership interests in the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Group, LLC, as soon as possible\" and stated that the government must not be involved in those companies' management decisions.\n\nDespite his votes against bailout bills that loaned taxpayer money to large banks and auto manufacturers, Walz did vote with his Democratic colleagues to support the 2009 American Recovery & Reinvestment Act. As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Walz saw the stimulus bill as an opportunity to work \"with his congressional colleagues to make job creation through investment in public infrastructure like roads, bridges and clean energy the cornerstone of the economic recovery plan\". Walz has focused heavily on job and economic issues important to his southern Minnesota district, which has a mix of larger employers like the Mayo Clinic along with small businesses and agricultural interests. In July 2009 he voted for the Enhancing Small Business Research and Innovation Act, which he described as \"part of our long-term economic blueprint to spur job creation by encouraging America's entrepreneurs to innovate toward breakthrough technological advancements\".\nWalz also urged assistance for hog and dairy farmers who struggled with lower prices for their commodities in 2008 and 2009.\n\nWalz was a public school teacher for 20 years. He opposes using merit pay for teachers. Voting in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Walz pointed to its strong provisions in support of public school buildings. Walz is on record supporting legislation to lower tuition costs. In a February 12, 2009 speech, he said that the most important thing to do \"to ensure a solid base for [America's] economic future … is to provide the best education possible for [American] children.\" He has received strong backing for these policies from many interest groups, including the National Education Association, the American Association of University Women and the National Association of Elementary School Principals.\n\nWalz supports abortion rights and has a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood. The National Right to Life Committee gave him a rating of zero. In early 2009, Walz voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\nWalz strongly supports LGBT rights, including federal anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation. In a 2009 speech he called for an end to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. Walz voted in favor of the Matthew Shephard Hate Crimes Act and the Sexual Orientation Employment Nondiscrimination Act. In 2007, he received a 90% grade from the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT organization. In 2011, Walz announced his support for the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\nWalz is a longtime supporter of legalizing both medical and recreational cannabis use.\n\n\n\nWalz was sworn in as governor of Minnesota on January 7, 2019, at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul. Walz took the oath of office alongside incoming Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, Minnesota State Auditor Julie Blaha, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, all Democrats. Walz spoke about education and healthcare reform in his inauguration speech.\n\nWalz and his wife, Gwen, married in 1994. They lived in Mankato, Minnesota for nearly 20 years before moving to Saint Paul with their two children upon his election as governor.\n\nWalz's brother, Craig, was killed by a falling tree during a storm in 2016. He was survived by his wife Julie, and their son, Jacob, who suffered severe injuries but survived.\n\n\n"}

Potential sources are contaminated food or water, or \"hand-to-mouth\", directly from another person who is infected. Cases generally resolve spontaneously, with or without treatment, and the cause is typically unknown. The National Outdoor Leadership School has recorded about one incident per 5,000 person-field days by following strict protocols on hygiene and water treatment. More limited, separate studies have presented highly varied estimated rates of affliction that range from 3 percent to 74 percent of wilderness visitors. One survey found that long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers reported diarrhea as their most common illness. Based on reviews of epidemiologic data and literature, some researchers believe that the risks have been over-stated and are poorly understood by the public. U.S. adults annually experience 99 million episodes of acute diarrhea in a population of about 318 million. A very small fraction of these cases results from infections acquired in the wilderness, and all infectious agents occur in both wilderness and non-wilderness settings.\n\nThe average incubation periods for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are each 7 days. Certain other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may take weeks to manifest itself. The onset usually occurs within the first week of return from the field, but may also occur at any time while hiking.\n\nMost cases begin abruptly and usually result in increased frequency, volume, and weight of stool. Typically, a hiker experiences at least four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, low fever, urgency, and malaise, and usually the appetite is affected. The condition is much more serious if there is blood or mucus in stools, abdominal pain, or high fever. Dehydration is a possibility. Life-threatening illness resulting from WAD is extremely rare but can occur in people with weakened immune systems.\n\nSome people may be carriers and not exhibit symptoms.\n\nInfectious diarrhea acquired in the wilderness is caused by various bacteria, viruses, and parasites (protozoa). The most commonly reported are the protozoa \"Giardia\" and \"Cryptosporidium\". Other infectious agents may play a larger role than generally believed and include \"Campylobacter\", hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, enterotoxogenic \"E. coli\", \"E. coli\" O157:H7, \"Shigella\", and various other viruses. More rarely, \"Yersinia enterocolitica\", \"Aeromonas hydrophila\", and \"Cyanobacterium\" may also cause disease.\n\n\"Giardia lamblia\" cysts usually do not tolerate freezing although some cysts can survive a single freeze–thaw cycle. Cysts can remain viable for nearly three months in river water when the temperature is 10 °C and about one month at 15–20 °C in lake water. \"Cryptosporidium\" may survive in cold waters (4 °C) for up to 18 months, and can even withstand freezing, although its viability is thereby greatly reduced. Many other varieties of diarrhea-causing organisms, including \"Shigella\" and \"Salmonella typhi\", and hepatitis A virus, can survive freezing for weeks to months. Virologists believe all surface water in the United States and Canada has the potential to contain human viruses, which cause a wide range of illnesses including diarrhea, polio and meningitis.\n\nModes of acquiring infection from these causes are limited to fecal-oral transmission, and contaminated water and food. The major factor governing pathogen content of surface water is human and animal activity in the watershed.\n\nIt may be difficult to associate a particular case of diarrhea with a recent wilderness trip of a few days because incubation of the disease may outlast the trip. Studies of trips that are much longer than the average incubation period, e.g. a week for \"Cryptosporidium\" and \"Giardia\", are less susceptible to these errors since there is enough time for the diarrhea to occur during the trip. Other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may require weeks.\n\nA suspected case of wilderness-acquired diarrhea may be assessed within the general context of intestinal complaints. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non-infectious diarrhea. There are an estimated 99 million annual cases of intestinal infectious disease in the United States, most commonly from viruses, followed by bacteria and parasites, including Giardia and Cryptosporidium. There are an estimated 1.2 million U.S. cases of symptomatic giardiasis annually. However, only about 40% of cases are symptomatic.\n\nSince wilderness acquired diarrhea can be caused by insufficient hygiene, contaminated water, and (possibly) increased susceptibility from vitamin deficiency, prevention methods should address these causes.\n\nThe risk of fecal-oral transmission of pathogens that cause diarrhea can be significantly reduced by good hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water after urination and defecation, and washing eating utensils with warm soapy water. Additionally a three-bowl system can be used for washing eating utensils.\n\nWater can be treated in the wilderness through filtering, chemical disinfectants, a portable ultraviolet light device, pasteurizing or boiling. Factors in choice may include the number of people involved, space and weight considerations, the quality of available water, personal taste and preferences, and fuel availability.\n\nIn a study of long-distance backpacking, it was found that water filters were used more consistently than chemical disinfectants. Inconsistent use of iodine or chlorine may be due to disagreeable taste, extended treatment time or treatment complexity due to water temperature and turbidity.\n\nBecause methods based on halogens, such as iodine and chlorine, do not kill \"Cryptosporidium\", and because filtration misses some viruses, the best protection may require a two-step process of either filtration or coagulation-flocculation, followed by halogenation. Boiling is effective in all situations.\n\nIodine resins, if combined with microfiltration to remove resistant cysts, are also a viable single-step process, but may not be effective under all conditions. New one-step techniques using chlorine dioxide, ozone, and UV radiation may prove effective, but still require validation.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) light for water disinfection is well established and widely used for large applications, like municipal water systems. Some hikers use small portable UV devices which meet the U.S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers, for example, the SteriPEN. Another approach to portable UV water purification is solar disinfection (also called sodis). Clear water is sterilized by putting it in a clear polyethylene (PET) bottle and leaving it in direct sunlight for 6 hours.\n\nDifferent types of water sources may have different levels of contamination:\nRain storms can either improve or worsen water quality. They can wash contaminants into water and stir up contaminated sediments with increasing flow, but can also dilute contaminants by adding large amounts of water.\n\nUnfortunately, there have not been any epidemiological studies to validate the above, except possibly for the case of spring water.\n\nOne study suggests that on very long trips in the wilderness, taking multivitamins may reduce the incidence of diarrhea.\n\nWAD is typically self-limited, generally resolving without specific treatment. Oral rehydration therapy with rehydration salts is often beneficial to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Clear, disinfected water or other liquids are routinely recommended.\n\nHikers who develop three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period – especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools – should be treated by a doctor and may benefit from antibiotics, usually given for 3–5 days. Alternatively, a single dose azithromycin or levofloxacin may be prescribed. If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated and treated for possible parasitic infection.\n\n\"Cryptosporidium\" can be quite dangerous to patients with compromised immune systems. Alinia (nitazoxanide) is approved by the FDA for treatment of \"Cryptosporidium\".\n\nThe risk of acquiring infectious diarrhea in the wilderness arises from inadvertent ingestion of pathogens. Various studies have sought to estimate diarrhea attack rates among wilderness travelers, and results have ranged widely. The variation of diarrhea rate between studies may depend on the time of year, the location of the study, the length of time the hikers were in the wilderness,\nthe prevention methods used, and the study methodology.\nThe National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), which emphasizes strict hand-washing techniques, water disinfection and washing of common cooking utensils in their programs, reports that gastrointestinal illnesses occurred at a rate of only 0.26 per 1000 program days. In contrast, a survey of long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers found more than half the respondents reported at least one episode of diarrhea that lasted an average of two days. (Infectious diarrhea may last longer than an average of two days; certain forms of non-infectious diarrhea, caused by diet change etc., can be of very brief duration). Analysis of this survey found occurrence of diarrhea was positively associated with the duration of exposure in the wilderness. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non-infectious diarrhea. A number of behaviors each individually reduced the incidence of diarrhea: treating water; routinely washing hands with soap and water after defecation and urination; cleaning cooking utensils with soap and warm water; and taking multi-vitamins.\nA variety of pathogens can cause infectious diarrhea, and most cases among backpackers appear to be caused by bacteria from feces. A study at Grand Teton National Park found 69% of diarrhea affected visitors had no identifiable cause, that 23% had diarrhea due to \"Campylobacter\" and 8% of patients with diarrhea had giardiasis. Campylobacter enteritis occurred most frequently in young adults who had hiked in wilderness areas and drunk untreated surface water in the week prior. Another study tested 35 individuals before and after a trip to the Desolation Wilderness of California. Giardia cysts were found in fecal samples from two people after the trip, but they were asymptomatic. A third person was empirically treated for symptoms of giardiasis.\nFecal-oral transmission may be the most common vector for wilderness acquired diarrhea. There are differing opinions regarding the importance of routine disinfection of water during relatively brief backcountry visits.\n\nInfection by fecal coliform bacteria, which indicate fecal pollution, are more common than giardiasis. Risks are highest in surface water near trails used by pack animals and cattle pastures.\n\nMost samples of backcountry water in the Desolation Wilderness in California have found very low or no \"Giardia\" cysts. The infectious dose of giardia, however, is very low, with about 2% chance of infection from a single cyst. Also, very few studies have addressed the issue of transient contamination. According to one researcher, the likely model for the risk of \"Giardia\" from wilderness water is pulse contamination, that is, a brief period of high cyst concentration from fecal contamination.\n\nDiarrhea acquired in the wilderness or other remote areas is typically a form of infectious diarrhea, itself classified as a type of secretory diarrhea. These are all considered forms of gastroenteritis. The term may be applied in various remote areas of non-tropical developed countries (U.S., Canada, western Europe, etc.), but is less applicable in developing countries, and in the tropics, because of the different pathogens that are most likely to cause infection.\n\n"}

It has a length of 100 km.\n\nThe Emajõgi is sometimes called the Suur Emajõgi (\"Great Emajõgi\"), in contrast with the Väike Emajõgi (\"Little Emajõgi\"), another river which flows into the southern end of Lake Võrtsjärv.\n\nEmajõgi is the second largest river in Estonia by discharge and the only fully navigable river.\n\nThe source of Emajõgi is at the northeastern shore of Võrtsjärv at Rannu-Jõesuu, from where the river follows a roughly eastward course towards Lake Peipsi.\n\nThe course of Emajõgi is divided into 3 distinct sections. In the upper course, from Võrtsjärv to Kärevere bridge, the river flows through large, flat and marshy areas, which are part of Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve. In this heavily meandering section, Emajõgi lacks a clearly defined floodplain – the flooded area spans several kilometres at times and has no definite borders. In the middle course from Kärevere to Kavastu through Tartu, Emajõgi follows a straighter course and flows in a clearly defined, shallow valley mostly a maximum of 10 m deep. The width of the valley in the middle course is 1–1.5 km; in Tartu, it narrows to 800 m. The narrowest section of the valley (400–600 m) is located in the end of the middle course near Kavastu. In the lower course, the river flows through a swampy lowland – Emajõe Suursoo – before emptying into Lake Peipsi at Praaga.\n\nThe length of the river is . In 1927, its length was measured to be . This may have changed somewhat in the 1930s, when the river's meandering upper course was straightened to allow for easier navigation.\n\nThe Emajõgi has been widely used as a waterway and trade route for centuries. In the past, it has also been an obstacle for land transport between Northern and Southern Estonia, because the river flows in a low-lying and swampy valley. Of the few suitable locations for crossing the river, Tartu has the most favourable conditions. Due to its location on the crossing of land and water routes, Tartu became an important trading center in Ancient Estonia.\n\nIn the 19th century, Emajõgi was actively used for transporting different cargo to Tartu – firewood, timber, hay, fish, and so on. The main type of vessel used was the \"lodi\", a small river barge or sailing ship adjusted for navigation on Lake Peipsi and Emajõgi. Up to 200 barges were anchored in Tartu port at the time. The first steam paddler appeared on Emajõgi in 1843; there were six by 1900.\nThe last river barges disappeared by the mid-20th century. Several new ships were brought to the river in the Soviet era to continue navigation to Pskov, Piirissaar, among other destinations. Fast hydrofoils, which were first introduced in 1960s, operated daily on the Tartu-Pskov route. Traffic on the route ended in 1992. Though attempts have been made to restart it since 1997, it remains closed.\n\nEmajõgi is crossed by 10 bridges, the majority of them located in Tartu.\nThe bridges are, in downstream order:\n\nIn addition to the bridges, the only operating cable ferry in Estonia crosses the river at Kavastu, about downstream of Luunja bridge.\n"}

It is meant to reflect on the role of law in the foundation of the country and to recognize its importance for society.\n\nBefore President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared May 1 to be Law Day, U.S.A., the first day of May was known in some parts of the world as May Day: a day to remember the struggles of workers in their fight for better wages and working conditions. Law Day was originally the idea of Charles S. Rhyne, Eisenhower's legal counsel for a time, who was serving in 1957–1958 as president of the American Bar Association. Eisenhower proclaimed May 1 to be Law Day, U.S.A. in 1958. Its observance was later codified by Public Law 87-20 on April 7, 1961.\n\nSome countries celebrate May Day on the same date, as it is designated Labour Day or International Workers Day. But on February 5, 1958, President Eisenhower recognized the first Law Day when he proclaimed that henceforth May 1 of each year would be Law Day in the United States. He stated: \"In a very real sense, the world no longer has a choice between force and law. If civilization is to survive it must choose the rule of law.\" Today, many local bars and legal education associations, such as the Florida Law Related Education Association and the New York State Bar Association, use Law Day as a legal education tool, especially for students. The day has been criticized as being intended to reduce the influence of May Day, a holiday that originated with a workers revolt in the 1800s.\n\nLike Earth Day, Law Day is not a government holiday. To celebrate Law Day, some local bar associations hold a luncheon, featuring speakers who discuss topics such as justice or the liberties provided for by the United States Constitution. Also, attorneys might visit schools and talk to students about the American legal system.\n\nThe American Bar Association designates a theme to highlight an important issue relating to the law or legal system. The 2014 theme was American Democracy and the Rule of Law: Why Every Vote Matters. The theme reflects the importance of voting rights, ballot box accessibility and voter engagement. The ABA provides resources on its Law Day website, www.lawday.org, to mark the occasion, and also holds several national Law Day programs in Washington, D.C., on April 30 and May 1.\n\n36 U.S.C. § 113 states, in part:\n\n\n"}

The last ten southbound miles are concurrent with Business I-49.\n\nSome (about half) of those last to Carthage, from its junction with I-49 Business at Madison Ave. in Webb City, are routed in a northeasterly direction.

{"id": "2216647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216647", "title": "Misrepresentation", "text": "Misrepresentation\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, a misrepresentation is an untrue or misleading statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, the statement then inducing that other party to enter into a contract. The misled party may normally rescind the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission).\n\nThe law of misrepresentation is an amalgam of contract and tort; and its sources are common law, equity and statute. The common law was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967. The general principle of misrepresentation has been adopted by the USA and various Commonwealth countries, e.g. India.\n\nA \"representation\" is a pre-contractual statement made during negotiations. If a representation has been incorporated into the contract as a term, then the normal remedies for breach of contract apply. Factors that determine whether or not a representation has become a term include:\n\nOtherwise, an action may lie in misrepresentation, and perhaps in the torts of negligence and deceit also. Although a suit for breach of contract is relatively straightforward, there are advantages in bringing a parallel suit in misrepresentation, because whereas repudiation is available only for breach of condition, rescission is \"prima facie\" available for all misreps, subject to the provisions of s.2 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, and subject to the inherent limitations of an equitable remedy.\n\nFor a misrepresentation to occur, especially a negligent misrepresentation, the following elements need to be satisfied.\n\nThere is no general duty of disclosure in English contract law, and one is normally not obliged to say anything. Ordinary contracts do not require \"good faith\" as such, and mere compliance with the law is sufficient. However in particular relationships silence may form the basis of an actionable misrepresentation:\n\n\nTo amount to a misrepresentation, the statement must be untrue or seriously misleading. A statement which is \"technically true\" but which gives a misleading impression is deemed an \"untrue statement\". If a misstatement is made and later the representor finds that it is false, it becomes fraudulent unless the representer updates the other party. If the statement is true at the time, but becomes untrue due to a change in circumstances, the representor must update the original statement. Actionable misrepresentations must be misstatements of fact or law: misstatements of opinion or intention are not deemed statements of fact; but if one party appears to have specialist knowledge of the topic, his \"opinions\" may be considered actionable misstatements of fact. For example, false statements made by a seller regarding the quality or nature of the property that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation.\n\nStatements of opinion are usually insufficient to amount to a misrepresentation as it would be unreasonable to treat personal opinions as \"facts\", as in \"Bisset v Wilkinson\". \n\nExceptions can arise where opinions may be treated as \"facts\":\n\n- where an opinion is expressed yet this opinion is not actually held by the representor,\n\n- where it is implied that the representor has facts on which to base the opinion,\n\n- where one party should have known facts on which such an opinion would be based.\n\nStatements of intention do not constitute misrepresentations should they fail to come to fruition, since the time the statements were made they can not be deemed either true or false. However, an action can be brought if the intention never actually existed, as in \"Edgington v Fitzmaurice\".\n\nFor many years, statements of law were deemed incapable of amounting to misrepresentations because the law is \"equally accessible by both parties\" and is \"...as much the business of the plaintiff as of [the defendants] to know what the law [is].\". This view has changed, and it is now accepted that statements of law may be treated as akin to statements of fact. As stated by Lord Denning \"...the distinction between law and fact is illusory\".\n\nAn action in misrepresentation can only be brought by the misled party, or \"representee\". This means that only those who were an intended recipient of the representation may sue, as in \"Peek v Gurney\", where the plaintiff sued the directors of a company for indemnity. The action failed because it was found that the plaintiff was not a representee (an intended party to the representation) and accordingly misrepresentation could not be a protection.\n\nIt is not necessary for the representation to have been be received directly; it is sufficient that the representation was made to another party with the intention that it would become known to a subsequent party and ultimately acted upon by them. However, it IS essential that the untruth originates from the defendant.\n\nThe misled party must show that he relied on the misstatement and was induced into the contract by it.\n\nIn \"Attwood v Small\", the seller, Small, made false claims about the capabilities of his mines and steelworks. The buyer, Attwood, said he would verify the claims before he bought, and he employed agents who declared that Small's claims were true. The House of Lords held that Attwood could not rescind the contract, as he did not rely on Small but instead relied on his agents. \"Edgington v Fitzmaurice\" confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.\n\nA party induced by a misrepresentation is not obliged to check its veracity. In \"Redgrave v Hurd\" Redgrave, an elderly solicitor told Hurd, a potential buyer, that the practice earned £300 pa. Redgrave said Hurd could inspect the accounts to check the claim, but Hurd did not do so. Later, having signed a contract to join Redgrave as a partner, Hurd discovered the practice generated only £200 pa, and the accounts verified this figure. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Redgrave had made a misrepresentation, adding that Hurd was entitled to rely on the £300 statement.\n\nBy contrast, in \"Leaf v International Galleries\", where a gallery sold painting after wrongly saying it was a Constable, Lord Denning held that while there was neither breach of contract nor operative mistake, there \"was\" a misrepresentation; but, five years having passed, the buyer's right to rescind had lapsed. This suggests that, having relied on a misrepresentation, the misled party has the onus to discover the truth \"within a reasonable time\". In \"Doyle v Olby\" [1969], a party misled by a fraudulent misrepresentation was deemed NOT to have affirmed even after more than a year.\n\nWithin trade and commerce, the law regarding misrepresentation is dealt with by the Australian Consumer Law, under Section 18 and 29 of this code, the ACL calls contractual misrepresentations as \"misleading and deceptive conduct\" and imposes a prohibition. The ACL provides for remedies, such as damages, injunctions, rescission of the contract, and other measures.\n\nIn England, the common law was codified and amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967. (Although short and apparently succinct, the 1967 Act is widely regarded as a confusing and poorly drafted statute which has caused a number of difficulties, especially in relation to the basis of the award of damages. It was mildly amended by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and in 2012, but it escaped the attention of the consolidating Consumer Rights Act 2015).\n\nPrior to the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the common law deemed that there were two categories of misrepresentation: fraudulent and innocent. The effect of the act is primarily to create a new category by dividing innocent misrepresentation into two separate categories: negligent and \"wholly\" innocent; and it goes on to state the remedies in respect of each of the three categories. The point of the three categories is that the law recognises that the defendant may have been blameworthy to a greater or lesser extent; and the relative degrees of blameworthiness lead to differing remedies for the claimant.\n\nOnce misrepresentation has been proven, it is presumed to be \"negligent misrepresentation\", the default category. It then falls to the claimant to prove that the defendant's culpability was more serious and that the misrepresentation was fraudulent. Conversely, the defendant may try to show that his misrepresentation was innocent.\n\n\n\n\nNegligent misstatement is not strictly part of the law of misrepresentation, but is a tort based upon the 1964 \"obiter dicta\" in \"Hedley Byrne v Heller\" where the House of Lords found that a negligently-made statement (if relied upon) could be actionable provided a \"special relationship\" existed between the parties.\n\nSubsequently in \"Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon\", Lord Denning transported this tort into contract law, stating the rule as:\n\n\"...if a man, who has or professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue thereof to another…with the intention of inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable'.\n\nDepending on the type of misrepresentation, remedies such as recission, or damages, or a combination of both may be available. Tortious liability may also be considered. Several countries, such as Australia have a statutory schema which deals with misrepresentations under consumer law.\n\nEntitlement to rescission of the contract, but not damages\n\nEntitlement to damages or rescission of the contract\n\nEntitlement to damages, or rescission of the contract\n\nA contract vitiated by misrepresentation is voidable and not void \"ab initio\". The misled party may either (i) rescind, or (ii) affirm and continue to be bound. If the claimant chooses to rescind, the contract will still be deemed to have been valid up to the time it was avoided, so any transactions with a third party remains valid, and the third party will retain good title. Rescission can be effected either by informing the representor or by requesting an order from the court. Rescission is an equitable remedy which is not always available. Rescission requires the parties to be restored to their former positions; so if this is not possible, rescission is unavailable.\n\nA misled party who, knowing of the misrepresentation, fails to take steps to avoid the contract will be deemed to have affirmed through \"laches\", as in \"Leaf v International Galleries\"; and the claimant will be estopped from rescinding. The time limit for taking such steps varies depending on the type of misrepresentation. In cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, the time limit runs until when the misrepresentation ought to have been discovered, whereas in innocent misrepresentation, the right to rescission may lapse even before the represent can reasonably be expected to know about it.\n\nSometimes, third party rights may intervene and render rescission impossible. Say, if A misleads B and contracts to sell a house to him, and B later sells to C, the courts are unlikely to permit rescission as that would unfair impinge upon C.\n\nUnder Misrepresentations Act 1967 s. 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the court has discretion to award damages instead of rescission, \"if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.\"\n\n\"Damages\" are monetary compensation for loss. In contract and tort, damages will be awarded if the breach of contract (or breach of duty) causes foreseeable loss.\n\n\nGiven the relative lack of blameworthiness of a non-fraudulent defendant (who is at worst merely careless, and at best may honestly \"believe on reasonable grounds\" that he told the truth) for many years lawyers presumed that for these two categories, damages would be on a contract/tort basis requiring reasonable foreseeability of loss.\n\nIn 1991, \"Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson\" changed all that. The court gave a literal interpretation of s.2 (which, to paraphrase, provides that where a person has been misled by a negligent misrepresentation then, if the misrepresentor would be liable to damages had the representation been made fraudulently, the defendant \"shall be so liable\"). The phrase shall be so liable was read literally to mean \"liable as in fraudulent misrepresentation\". So, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for negligent misrepresentation are calculated as if the defendant had been fraudulent, even if he has been merely careless. Although this was almost certainly not the intention of Parliament, no changes to the law have been made to address this discrepancy: the Consumer Rights Act 2015 left the 1967 Act intact. This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability.\n\nS.2 does not specify how \"damages in lieu\" should be determined, and interpretation of the statute is up to the courts.\n\nMisrepresentation is one of several vitiating factors that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include:\n\n\n\n"}

The acronym SRM is derived from the phrase Alpha System Reference Manual, the publication detailing the Alpha AXP architecture and which specified various features of the SRM firmware.\n\nThe SRM console was initially designed to boot DEC's OSF/1 AXP (later called Digital UNIX and finally Tru64 UNIX) and OpenVMS operating systems, although various other operating systems (such as Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD, for example) were also written to boot from the SRM console. The third proprietary operating system published for the Alpha AXP architecture – Microsoft Windows NT – did not boot from SRM; instead, Windows booted from the ARC (multi platform \"Advanced RISC Computing\") boot firmware. (ARC is also known as AlphaBIOS.)\n\nOn many Alpha computer systems – for example, the Digital Personal Workstation – both SRM and ARC could be loaded onto the EEPROM which held the boot firmware. However, on some smaller systems (or large systems which were never intended to boot Windows), only one of the two boot firmware variants could fit onto the EEPROM at one time. For example, the flash EEPROM of certain models of the DEC Multia, which was a small, personal Alpha AXP workstation designed to run Windows NT, was only large enough to hold a single firmware.\n\nThe SRM console is capable of display on either a graphical adapter (such as a PCI VGA card) or, if no graphical console and/or local keyboard is detected, on a serial connection to a VT100-compatible terminal. In this way the SRM console is similar to the Open Firmware used in SPARC and Apple PowerMac computers, for example.\n\nUpon system initialization, an Alpha AXP computer set to boot from the SRM console displays a short report of the software version of the firmware, and presents the \"three chevron prompt\" consisting of three greater-than signs:\n\nSeveral commands are available by typing them at the prompt, and a list of possible commands is available by entering the command codice_1 or codice_2 at the prompt. Various system variables for establishing automatic boot settings, parameter strings to be passed to an operating system and the like may also be set from the SRM prompt. The SRM firmware contains drivers for booting from boot media including SCSI hard disks and CD-ROM drives attached to a supported SCSI adapter, various IDE ATA and ATAPI devices, and network booting via BOOTP or DHCP is possible with supported network adapters. \n\nWhen an appropriate disk boot device is available, the SRM console locates and loads the target primary bootstrap image using information written in the target disk boot block; in logical block zero. The boot block contains the disk location and block size of the target primary bootstrap image file, and SRM will load that into memory and will then transfer control to it.\n\n"}

The shallow lake is 33.7 m (111 ft) above sea level. The river Emajõgi flows from Lake Võrtsjärv to Lake Peipus.\n\nThe lake basin existed before the Last Ice Age, but was then transformed by moving ice sheets which partly eroded the lake wall and partly filled the depression with deposits. In its present form the lake has existed since the Middle Holocene.\n\nIt was first mentioned in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry, where it is called \"Worcegerwe\".\n\nThe relatively low shores of the lake are swampy in the south and sandy in the north. On the eastern shore, there is a coastal abrasion near the village of Tamme; these cliffs have yielded a number of fossils of Devonian fish, which have been compared to similar fossils found in Scotland.\n\nThere are a few small islands in the southern part of the lake. Of these only Tondisaar and \"Pähksaar\" are permanent islands, while \"Ainsaar\" becomes a peninsula during low water and \"Heinassaar\" is submerged at high water. This is because of the lakes fluctuating water level, which changes with a mean annual amplitude of 1.4 m; this is about half of its 2.8 m average depth. From around November to April, the lake is covered with an ice sheet.\n\nSituated northeast of the lake is the Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve in Estonia.\n\nAround 35 species of fish are found in the lake, a few of which are commercially important. After a decline of valuable species during the 1950s and 1960s, some conservation measures were enforced which lead to an improvement in the situation. Today, around 400 t of fish are caught annually.\n\nLake Võrtsjärv is the main catchment area for eel in Estonia. However, fishing is entirely dependent on restocking with farmed glass eels, as eels are migratory and do no longer return in sufficient quantities to Europe. Due to declining numbers of natural eel, in 2017 the European Union's Agriculture and Fisheries Council decided on a three-month ban of eel fishing in the Baltic Sea during eel migratory season. Eel caught in the Baltic Sea had only accounted for a mere 700 kg the year before, as opposed to an average of 10.2-13.3 t per year in Lake Võrtsjärv.\n\nThe lake and the nearby wetlands are also an important breeding ground for birds, as well as a staging area for migratory birds. In total, 213 bird species have been recorded around the lake.\n\nIn recent decades, eutrophication of the lake has increased, with detrimental effects on biological diversity. This is thought to be mainly caused by a combination of poorly treated wastewater influx as well as phosphorus and nitrate runoff from agriculture. In addition, climatic fluctuations seem to have a stronger influence on the lake due to its shallow depth.\n\nThe region is little known as a tourist destination internationally, and the deteriorating water quality has posed a problem for both fishing and tourism development. However, Võrtsjärv was voted European Destination of Excellence in 2010.\n\nThere is a visitor centre and museum on the east shore of the lake.\n\n"}

Her husband's infidelities increased her already erratic behavior and led to a permanent mental illness, which lasted until her death.\n\nBorn in Florence on 29 May 1568, Virginia was the illegitimate daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his mistress Camilla Martelli. Her paternal grandparents were the famous condottiere Giovanni dalle Bande Nere and his wife Maria Salviati (in turn the granddaughter of Lorenzo the Magnificent) and her maternal grandparents were Antonio Martelli and Fiammetta Soderini, both members of the most important families among the Florentine patricians.\n\nVirginia was born after the formal resignation of her father of the government on behalf of her half-brother Francesco. Cosimo I contracted a morganatic marriage with Camilla Martelli on 29 March 1570 on the advice of Pope Pius V, and this allowed him to legitimize their daughter on the principle of \"per subsequens\". Since that time, she lived with her parents at the Villa di Castello during the summer and in Pisa in winter. Cosimo I's older children resented their father's second marriage, and after the death of the Grand Duke in 1574, they imprisoned Camilla in the Florentine convent of Murate.\n\nDespite the controversy about her illegitimate birth and ambiguous position in the Grand Ducal house, Virginia's older brothers began negotiations with the House of Sforza of a marriage between her and one of his members. In 1581 she was betrothed to Francesco Sforza, Count of Santa Fiora, but the wedding didn't take place because the groom chose the ecclesiastical career and became a Cardinal. After this, it was decided to arrange her marriage with a member of the House of Este with the purpose to improve the relations between both families and break the isolation of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany from the other Italian states. Virginia's half-brother Cardinal Ferdinando has agreed with Cardinal Luigi d'Este for the marriage of his nephew and Virginia. In addition, the second wife of Grand Duke Francesco I, Bianca Cappello, also played a big role in the conclusion of this alliance.\n\nIn Florence on 6 February 1586 Virginia married Cesare d'Este, son of Alfonso, Marquis of Montecchio, in turn the illegitimate (but later legitimized) son of Alfonso I, Duke of Ferrara. To celebrate this event was represented the comedy \"l’Amico Fido\", written by Giovanni de' Bardi and with the lyrics of Alessandro Striggio and Cristofano Malvezzi, and in Ferrara the poet Torquato Tasso dedicated a Cantata to the newlyweds.\n\nThe union produced ten children, six sons and four daughters:\n\nAt the end of February 1586 Virginia and Cesare arrived in Ferrara. They stayed at the Palazzo Diamanti, a gift of Cardinal Luigi d'Este, Cesare's uncle, who later bequeathed him all his possessions. One year later (1587), Virginia became in Marchioness consort of Montecchio after the death of her father-in-law.\n\nAfter the extinction of the legitimate line of the House of Este with the death of Duke Alfonso II on 27 October 1597 without issue, Cesare inherited the headship and all the possessions of the family; in consequence, Virginia became in the Duchess consort of Ferrara, Modena and Reggio, Princess consort of Carpi, Princess of the Holy Roman Empire, Duchess consort of Chartres and Montargis, Countess consort of Gisors, Viscountess consort of Caen, Bayeux and Falaise. However, the rule over Ferrara was short-lived: although Emperor Rudolf II recognized the rights of Cesare over Modena and Reggio (both Imperial fiefs), Pope Clement VIII didn't recognized Cesare's succession in Ferrara (nominally a Papal fief) on grounds of doubtful legitimacy. On 15 January 1598 the Duchy of Ferrara was officially abolished and returned to the Papal States, despite Cesare's attempts to obtain the help of the major European powers. Cesare, with his family and court, were forced to move to Modena, who became in the new capital of the dynasty. In 1599 Cesare obtained the Lordship of Sassuolo, but in 1601 the Parlement of Paris stripped him of all the domains and titles in the Kingdom of France.\n\nIn 1596, the first signs of madness were manifested in Virginia, who suffered from this condition until her death. Nevertheless, she coped with her motherly duties with her numerous offspring and showed herself as a clever and far-sighted ruler when in January 1601, in the absence of her husband (who was in Reggio) the heavily pregnant Duchess took the position of Regent. During this time she stopped the attempts of the Podesta and Judge of Modena to deprive her of the government. However, Virginia was unable to control her unpredictable anger fits: when in March 1608 her confessor, the Jesuit Jerome Bondinari claimed that she was possessed by the devil, the Duchess violently attacked him with shouts and nearly beat him to death with a stick. After this, exorcism sessions were held in her, during which it became clear that Virginia's mental illness was caused by the fact that she was married against her will, and worsened due to the infidelities of her husband. The attempts of expulsion the demons in her finally originated that Virginia became completely insane. She only recovered her sense on the day of her death; in her deathbed, she blessed all her children and died peacefully.\n\nVirginia died on 15 January 1615 in Modena aged 46; there were rumors that she was poisoned by her husband. The memorial service, who was held on 27 February at Modena Cathedral was celebrated by the Jesuit Agostino Mascardi. She was buried in the crypt of the House of Este in the Church of St. Vincent in Modena.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Sam Poulten through the holding company Merrimack Valley Radio, LLC. The station's studios are located on Market Street in Lowell.\n\nWCAP began commercial broadcasting in 1951 after a five-year licensing odyssey that saw the station's city of license, proposed hours of operation, output power and call letters changed at various points during the proceedings.\n\nStation head Israel \"Ike\" Cohen established Northeast Radio Inc. in 1946. He sought a license at 1210 kHz in Lawrence and was granted the call letters WABW. However, when the call letters WCAP became available, Cohen took those calls, and later won approval to amend his application to seek 980 kHz, which was ultimately granted a construction permit in the spring of 1949 as part of a regional arrangement under which the \"Brockton Enterprise\" won approval to increase the power of its WBET from 250 to 1,000 watts at 990 kHz (the station later moved to 1460 to add nighttime service), and a mutually exclusive application for 980 in Newport, Rhode Island was denied and dismissed for reasons including lack of candor on the part of that applicant. When the family that owned the \"Lawrence Daily Eagle\" and \"Evening Tribune\" newspapers appeared poised to win approval for an upgrade of its station, WLAW, to 50 kW on 680 kHz (now occupied by WRKO), Cohen sought and received approval to move the station license from Lawrence to Lowell, which at the time was home to only a 250-watt station, WLLH.\n\nThe original investors in WCAP were Cohen and his brothers Theodore and Maurice, each with 20%, Ray Goulding, of Bob and Ray fame, and his brother Philip, an announcer at WMGM in New York City, where Israel Cohen worked as an engineer, each with 5% and engineer Ralph Floyd, 30%. Ray Goulding was station manager and Phillip Goulding served as program director. Ray hosted occasional afternoon programs. Ray Goulding was active in working to get the station on the air, appearing at a meeting of the Lowell Planning Board to advance an argument in favor of a transmitter and studio location that was rejected. The Gouldings were ousted from their positions in a stockholders meeting on September 10, 1951, three months after the station went on the air. Phillip Goulding was quoted by the \"Lowell Sun\" newspaper of September 11, 1951 as saying the ousters came as a shock, and the brothers planned to contest it, however they sold their interest in the station to the Cohen brothers. The newspaper reported that the day following the firing of the Gouldings, the daytime-only station signed on two hours late as employees staged a sick-out. Ray, who had been born in Lowell, pulled the first air shift on WCAP, and Ike Cohen kept a signed copy of the program log in his office for the rest of his life. It was Goulding's first on-air appearance on a Lowell station under his real name; he had previously worked at WLLH as Dennis Howard, taking the air name to avoid confusion with Phillip, who was an established news announcer in Boston at the time.\n\nThe station was the third to bear the call letters WCAP, the original sign-on for both of the others, in Asbury Park, New Jersey (now WADB) and in Washington D.C. (now defunct) were voiced by sportscaster Ted Husing. Israel Cohen, at the time a broadcast engineer at WMGM in New York, secured Husing's services for the third WCAP sign-on.\n\nIsrael Cohen ran the station until his death in 1994 and was succeeded by his brother Maurice. A deal to sell the station was made in August 2007, approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on September 25, 2007, and the transaction was consummated on November 21, 2007. The station is now owned by Merrimack Valley Radio, LLC.\n\nIn early 2011, the two primary partners in the station, Clark Smidt and Sam Poulten, were involved in a legal dispute over operation of the station, with both claiming that the other partner put WCAP in financial danger. The dispute ended on June 28, when Poulten agreed to purchase Smidt's 55-percent stake in the station, giving him full ownership.\n\nAfter having operated from studios on Central Street in Lowell since its 1951 sign-on, WCAP moved to a street-level studio on Market Street in 2019.\n\nDuring the week, WCAP broadcasts a news/talk radio format including both local talk programs and the nationally syndicated progressive talk shows \"The Thom Hartmann Program\" and \"The Stephanie Miller Show\". Nights and weekends, the station broadcasts an oldies format called \"Beatles & Before\". WCAP's seasonal programming also includes live broadcasts of Lowell Spinners baseball, high school football and basketball matchups, and UMass Lowell River Hawks hockey.\n\nThe station conducts an annual radiothon to benefit the Salvation Army each December.\n"}

For example, in a signature consisting of a single binary operation, the term algebra over a set \"X\" of variables is exactly the free magma generated by \"X\". Other synonyms for the notion include absolutely free algebra and anarchic algebra.\n\nFrom a category theory perspective, a term algebra is the initial object for the category of all algebras of the same signature, and this object, unique up to isomorphism, is called an initial algebra; it generates by homomorphic projection all algebras in the category.\n\nA similar notion is that of a Herbrand universe in logic, usually used under this name in logic programming, which is (absolutely freely) defined starting from the set of constants and function symbols in a set of clauses. That is, the Herbrand universe consists of all ground terms: terms that have no variables in them.\n\nAn atomic formula or atom is commonly defined as a predicate applied to a tuple of terms; a ground atom is then a predicate in which only ground terms appear. The Herbrand base is the set of all ground atoms that can be formed from predicate symbols in the original set of clauses and terms in its Herbrand universe. These two concepts are named after Jacques Herbrand.\n\nTerm algebras also play a role in the semantics of abstract data types, where an abstract data type declaration provides the signature of a multi-sorted algebraic structure and the term algebra is a concrete model of the abstract declaration.\n\nTerm algebras can be shown decidable using quantifier elimination. The complexity of the decision problem is in NONELEMENTARY.\n\nThe signature σ of a language is a triple <\"O\", \"F\", \"P\"> consisting of the alphabet of constants \"O\", the function symbols \"F\", and the predicates \"P\". The Herbrand base of a signature σ consists of all ground atoms of σ: of all formulas of the form \"R\"(\"t\", …, \"t\"), where \"t\", …, \"t\" are terms containing no variables (i.e. elements of the Herbrand universe) and \"R\" is an \"n\"-ary relation symbol (\"i.e.\" predicate). In the case of logic with equality, it also contains all equations of the form \"t\" = \"t\", where \"t\" and \"t\" contain no variables.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216683", "title": "Mistake (contract law)", "text": "Mistake (contract law)\n\nIn contract law, a mistake is an erroneous belief, \"at contracting\", that certain facts are true. It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found void \"ab initio\" or voidable, or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'. The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.\n\nAnother breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.\n\nThe law of mistake in any given contract is governed by the law governing the contract. The law from country to country can differ significantly. For instance, contracts entered into under a relevant mistake have not been voidable in English law since Great Peace Shipping v Tsavliris (International) Ltd (2002).\n\nMistake can be:\n\nMistake of law: when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is \"induced\" to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.\n\nIllustration: Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable.\n\nMistake of fact: Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is voidable.\n\nExplanation: An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.\n\nIllustration: Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.\n\nAnti-illustration: A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.\n\nA unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract. This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. \n\nOrdinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void. Traditionally this is caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), and under common law caveat venditor (let the seller beware).\n\nA contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following:\n\nA mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same \"material\" fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. \"Collateral\" mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be \"material\" (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.\n\nThis is easily confused with mutual assent cases such as \"Raffles v Wichelhaus\".\n\nIn \"Raffles\", there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named \"Peerless\", but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped.\n\nIn this case, both parties believed there was a \"meeting of the minds,\" but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract. Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario.\n\nA common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts.\n\nThe House of Lords case of \"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.\" established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.\n\nLater in \"Solle v Butcher\", Lord Denning added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as \"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd\".. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in Queensland), see \"Svanosio v McNamara\". For Queensland, see \"Australian Estates v Cairns City Council\".\n\nThose categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a \"decisional mistake,\" which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an \"ignorant mistake,\" unaware of the true state of affairs.\n\nThe difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy.\n\nUnder New Mexico law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier’s check. \"Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.\", 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952):\n\n‘A thing is done “in good faith” within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not.\n‘…[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.’\n\n56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act).\n\nRoswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the state of New Mexico, and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably \"Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456\", 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114.\n\nThe Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis:\n\nIn Kentucky, it was held that in \"French Bank of California v. First National Bank of Louisville\", money received by mistake does not have to be returned if there is an irrevocable change in position. It held that mistakes do not need to be rectified except by court order or indemnities being issued.\n\n\"Union Bank & Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.\", 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932).\n\nThe law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in \"Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States\", 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce \"anti-dumping\" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a “liquidation duty” at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error “…was correctable under 19 U.S.C. § 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context …” Id. at 1319.\n\nThe \"Hynix\" court explains the difference between a mistake of law “…where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are…,” \"Century Importers, Inc. v.

Some English translations say that it was used for the steps rather than the pillars and biblical commentators Keil and Delitzsch suggest \"we should have to think of steps with bannisters\" to make sense of the text.\n\nIt is likely that the wood was brought by the ships of Tarshish, sent from the Red Sea port of Ezion-Giber, from the distant country of Ophir, and was very valuable.\n\nThe botanical identity of algum is not known for certain, though some references suggest it may be juniper (\"Juniperus\"). Several species of juniper occur in the Middle East region, including \"Juniperus excelsa\" (Greek juniper), \"Juniperus foetidissima\" (stinking juniper), \"Juniperus phoenicea\" (Phoenician juniper), and \"Juniperus drupacea\" (Syrian juniper). It is likely that the woods of these species, which are all very similar in woodworking properties, would have not been distinguished from each other in the wood trade. The difficulty in identifying this wood is due in part to uncertainty over the location of the biblical city of Ophir. If Ophir is located in India, as some think, the wood likely would be red sandalwood or \"Pterocarpus santalinus\".\n"}
{"id": "2216709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216709", "title": "Mistake (criminal law)", "text": "Mistake (criminal law)\n\nA mistake of fact may sometimes mean that, while a person has committed the physical element of an offence, because they were labouring under a mistake of fact, they never formed the required \"mens rea\", and so will escape liability for offences that require \"mens rea\". This is unlike a mistake of law, which is not usually a defense; law enforcement may or may not take for granted that individuals know what the law is.\n\nMost criminal law systems in developed states exclude mistake of law as a defense, because allowing defendants to invoke their own ignorance of the law would breach the public policy represented by the Latin maxim: \"ignorantia legis neminem excusat\". But someone operating under a mistake of fact will not generally be liable, because, although the defendant has committed the \"actus reus\" of the offense, the defendant may honestly believe in a set of facts that would prevent him or her from forming the requisite \"mens rea\" required to constitute the crime.\n\nFor example: A defendant goes into a supermarket and places eight items in a basket which is presented to the cashier for payment in the usual way. Both honestly believe that all eight items have been scanned, and the defendant pays the sum shown on the bill. A store detective, however, notices that a mistake was made by the cashier so that only seven items were priced. This detective arrests the defendant after leaving the store. Since the defendant honestly believes that he has become the owner of goods in a sale transaction, he cannot form the \"mens rea\" for theft (which is usually dishonesty) when he physically removes them from the store.\n\nThere is a complex question as to whether the defense of 'mistake' applies to crimes that do not specify a mental element – such as strict liability offences and manslaughter by criminal negligence. In Australia, the High Court's 2005 ruling in \"R v Lavender\" prevents the use of any 'reasonable mistake of fact' defense in cases of involuntary manslaughter. However, the defense of mistake \"is\" available to offences of strict liability such as drunk driving: see \"DPP v Bone\" [2005] NSWSC 1239. And it is the very availability of the defense of 'mistake' that distinguishes between offences of strict and \"absolute\" liability. Mistake of fact is unavailable in respect to absolute liability offences.\n\nThe Australian federal law's \"Criminal Code\" describes most Federal crimes, many of which were transferred from the \"Crimes Act 1914\" (Cth). However, the \"Crimes Act\" does still define some Federal crimes and others have been added in separate legislation for a variety of reason. For example, to override State or Territory laws, as with the \"Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994\" (Cth) that used the external affairs power to override the sodomy laws of the State of Tasmania, or with the \"Euthanasia Laws Act 1997\" (Cth) that recriminalised euthanasia in the Northern Territory. Separate legislation has also been used when powers have been transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, such as with the \"Corporations Act 2001\" (Cth) that includes penalties for misconduct by company directors, and in implementing international treaties, such as with the \"International Criminal Court Act 2002\" (Cth) that implemented the Rome Statute into Australian law.\n\nThe \"Criminal Code\" contains specific provisions dealing with ignorance and mistakes, which permits acquittal in cases of mistakes of fact but not of law. Further, it mandates that a mistake of fact need not be reasonable for the defense to be available, but allows a jury to consider whether a fact is unreasonable in determining whether the person did actually believe the mistake being claimed.\n\nThe leading Supreme Court of Canada case on the mistaken belief is \"R v Park\", in which it was held that even unreasonable beliefs must be left to a jury to consider. The issue in most states is the extent to which the test of belief should be subjective or objective.\n\nMistake of fact may be a defence in criminal law if it is genuine, whether or not it is reasonable.\n\nIn \"DPP v Morgan\" an RAF officer told three other officers to have sex with his wife, and that she would pretend to refuse just to be stimulating. They pleaded mistake, and the jury did not believe them. The House of Lords held that the judge had wrongly directed the jury that the mistake must be a reasonable one; the correct legal test was whether the defendants had honestly believed the wife was consenting, not whether they reasonably believed this. However, on the facts the House of Lords held the conviction was nonetheless safe despite the misdirection.\nR v Williams (Gladstone) confirmed the principle stated in \"Morgan\" that a belief that a certain set of facts are true does not need to be reasonable to operate under the defence of mistake. It merely needs to be genuine. However, the reasonableness of that belief is material in the jury deciding whether the defendant had actually held that belief.\n\nAn exception to this appears to be bigamy (see \"R v Tolson\" (1889) 23 QBD 168).\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act 2003 has introduced a hybrid test of reasonable belief as to consent. The defendant must now be seen to have taken steps to ascertain clearly whether the \"victim\" was consenting in all the circumstances. This abolishes the defence of a genuine though unreasonably mistaken belief as to the consent.\n\nIt is not a defence that the defendant held an honest and reasonable belief that what he was doing was not criminal. Where the defendant is a foreigner, and the offence is not criminal in his own country, the fact of such a belief is still not a defence. It is not a defence that the defendant believed that he would not be prosecuted for what he was doing.\n\nSection 3(2) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 provides:\n\nA mistake about the civil law may have the effect of negativing the mens rea for an offence.

This result is known as \"Apéry's theorem\". The original proof is complex and hard to grasp, and simpler proofs were found later.\n\nBeuker's simplified irrationality proof involves approximating the integrand of the known triple integral for formula_2,\n\nby the Legendre polynomials.\nIn particular, van der Poorten's article chronicles this approach by noting that\n\nwhere formula_5, formula_6 are the Legendre polynomials, and the subsequences formula_7 are integers or almost integers.\n\nIt is still not known whether Apéry's constant is transcendental.\n\nIn addition to the fundamental series: \nLeonhard Euler gave the series representation:\nin 1772, which was subsequently rediscovered several times.\n\nOther classical series representations include:\n\nSince the 19th century, a number of mathematicians have found convergence acceleration series for calculating decimal places of . Since the 1990s, this search has focused on computationally efficient series with fast convergence rates (see section \"Known digits\").\n\nThe following series representation was found by A.A.

The term Affiche Rouge also refers more broadly to the circumstances surrounding the poster's creation and distribution, the capture, trial and execution of these members of the Manouchian Group.\n\nIn mid-November 1943, the French police arrested 23 members of the Communist Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigrée (FTP-MOI), who were part of the French Resistance. They were called the \"Manouchian Group\" after the commander, Missak Manouchian. The group was part of a network of about 100 fighters, who committed nearly all acts of armed resistance in the Paris metropolitan region between March and November 1943.\n\nIts membership included 22 men: eight Poles, five Italians, three Hungarians, two Armenians, a Spaniard, three French men, and a Romanian woman; eleven members were Jewish.\n\nAfter having been tortured and interrogated for three months, the 23 were tried by a German military court. To discredit the Resistance, the authorities invited French celebrities (from the world of the cinema and other arts) to attend the trial and encouraged the media to give it the widest coverage possible. All but one of the Manouchian Group's members were executed before a firing squad in Fort Mont-Valérien on 21 February 1944. Olga Bancic, who had served the group as a messenger, was taken to Stuttgart, where she was beheaded with an axe on 10 May 1944.\n\nIn the spring of 1944, the Vichy authorities launched a propaganda campaign, designed to discredit the Manouchian Group and defuse public anger over their execution. They created a poster, which became known as , due to its red background. It featured ten men of the group, with nationality, surnames, photos and descriptions of their crimes; the Germans distributed an estimated 15,000 copies of the poster. Along with these posters, the Germans handed out flyers that claimed the Resistance was headed by foreigners, Jews, unemployed people, and criminals; the campaign characterized the Resistance as a \"foreigners' conspiracy against French life and the sovereignty of France\":\n\n\"\"Si des Français pillent, volent, sabotent et tuent...\nCe sont toujours des étrangers qui les commandent.\nCe sont toujours des chômeurs et des criminels professionnels qui exécutent.\nCe sont toujours des juifs qui les inspirent.\nC’est l’armée du crime contre la France.\nLe banditisme n’est pas l’expression du Patriotisme blessé, c’est le complot étranger contre la vie des Français et contre la souveraineté de la France.\"\"\n\nAlthough the poster attempted to depict the group as \"terrorists\", the campaign seems to have had the effect of highlighting the feats of people whom the general public considered to be freedom fighters. Legend has it that supporters scribbled the words \"MORTS POUR LA FRANCE\" across the posters (\"They died for France\" - the phrase used on official monuments to soldiers of France who died in combat) and put flowers beneath some of the posters. In 1975, historian Philippe Ganier Raymond claimed that there was no historical record of such activity. But more recent research has in fact confirmed that such additions by residents took place.\n\nIn 1955, Louis Aragon wrote a poem memorializing the Manouchian Group, \"Strophes pour se souvenir\". The poem was published in 1956 in \"Le roman inachevé\". In 1959 Léo Ferré set it to music and recorded it as . Rouben Melik and Paul Éluard also wrote poems in honour of the Manouchian Group.\n\nIn 1997, at the prompting of Robert Badinter, a French senator and former Minister of Justice, the French Parliament authorized a monument to commemorate the execution at Mont-Valérien of 1,006 citizens and members of the French Resistance, including the Manouchian Group, between 1940 and 1944. The sculptor Pascal Convert was commissioned to create the monument and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin dedicated it on 20 September 2003.\n\nIn the 1980s, some French political factions suggested that, because of political infighting, some members of the Resistance had been complicit in the capture of many of the members of the Manouchian Group. A film documentary by Stéphane Courtois and Mosco Boucault, \"Des terroristes à la retraite\", broadcast by Antenne 2 in 1983, included interviews of surviving FTP-MOI members and families of the victims. Bouscault accused the French Communist Party (PCF) of having deliberately sacrificed the fighters in the power struggle with the Gaullists for control over the National Council of Resistance (CNR). He suggested this was done because the fighters' foreign origins undermined French depictions of the Resistance as a native patriotic movement. The film was rebroadcast in 2001, minus 12 minutes deleted to reflect more recent historical research.\n\n\"La traque de l'Affiche rouge\", a documentary produced by and Jorge Amat, broadcast by France 2 on 15 March 2007, refuted Courtois and Boucault's allegations. Quoting the historian , who had access to new documents from the Russian, French and German archives, the new documentary alleged that the fall of the Manouchian Group had been due exclusively to the French police. The two newly created branches of the \"Renseignements généraux\" (RG) intelligence agency—the \"Brigades spéciales\" 1 and 2—had trailed the Résistance fighters for months. On 28 September 1943, Marcel Rayman, with several others, shot and killed the SS General . Ritter organized the forced labor of the \"Service du travail obligatoire\" (STO). At that time, Rayman had already been under surveillance for two months. The French Milice arrested and dismantled the Manouchian Group after the attack, aided by information given by some members under torture.\n\nIn September 2009, the dramatic film \"L'Armée du crime\" opened in France, featuring the story of the Manouchian Group. Directed by Robert Guédiguian, a Marseille-based filmmaker of German and Armenian parentage, it was adapted from a story by Serge Le Péron. It reflects some of the divisions among the Résistance. In association with the film's release, reporters interviewed the last surviving member of the FTP-MOI group, Arsène Tchakarian. He decisively refuted the allegation that the PCF had betrayed the Manouchian Group and said that 35 members of the 40 in the group were communists. The film opened in the United States in 2010.\n\nThe poster reads:\n\n\"Des libérateurs?  La libération par l'armée du crime!\"<br>\n\"Liberators?  Liberation by the army of crime!\"\nFrom left to right, and top to bottom, individual portraits are labeled:\n\nThe bottom features photographs of:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Hermit Trail, a hiking trail that extends to the Colorado River, begins about mile beyond the shuttle bus stop at Hermits Rest. Hermits Rest also represents the western terminus of the Rim Trail. The location was named for Louis Boucher. Around 1891, Boucher - a Canadian-born prospector - staked claims below present-day Hermits Rest. With help, Boucher carved the aforementioned trail into the canyon, and for years lived alone at nearby Dripping Springs. The main structure currently standing at Hermits Rest was designed by architect Mary Colter. Hermits Rest is the westernmost point on the canyon's south rim that is accessible by paved road. It was built as a rest area for tourists on coaches operated by the Fred Harvey Company on the way to the now-vanished Hermit Camp. The building was designed to appear to be a natural stone formation, closely tied to the land. Colter selected furnishings that are included in the National Historic Landmark designation.\n\nHermits Rest is one of four Mary Jane Colter Buildings that, as a set, were added to the National Register of Historic Places and declared to be a National Historic Landmark in 1987. All were designed by Colter and were built for the Fred Harvey Company, which operated restaurants and hotels under contract with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, parent of the Grand Canyon Railway.\n\nHermits Rest stands a few feet from the rim of the Grand Canyon, partly buried in an earth mound. The exposed portions of the structure are designed to look like a natural rock formation, apart from the prominent rubblestone chimney. The structure is approached by a path that passes (and originally ran through) a stone arch decorated with a broken bell that Colter salvaged from a Spanish mission in New Mexico. A small porch supported by peeled log posts stands to one side of the outside observation area that overlooks the canyon rim. The low porch roof extends into the interior, which opens up to a double-height space. Opposite the entry, the south wall houses a semi-circular alcove with a fireplace and a raised floor.

{"id": "2216733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216733", "title": "Easy Action", "text": "Easy Action\n\nEasy Action is the second studio album by the American rock band Alice Cooper, released by Straight Records in March 1970. The title comes from a line from one of the band's favorite films, the musical \"West Side Story\". As with \"Pretties for You\", the band's debut from the previous year, \"Easy Action\" was neither a commercial nor critical success. Singles include \"Shoe Salesman\" and \"Return of the Spiders\".\n\nDrummer Neal Smith later said of the record producer David Briggs, \"David hated our music and us. I recall the term that he used, referring to our music, was 'Psychedelic Shit'. I think \"Easy Action\" sounded too dry, more like a TV or radio commercial and he did not help with song arrangement or positive input in any way.\" None of \"Easy Action\"’s songs have ever been performed live by Cooper since the tour in support of their third album \"Love It to Death\"; in fact, only \"Return of the Spiders\" was performed on the tour for that album.\n\nA small number of early U.S. copies were pressed on the blue Bizarre Records label. These copies carry the same catalog number WS-1845 and album cover as the regular Straight Records release.\n\nThough perhaps seen as being an overlooked work in terms of later releases, \"Easy Action\" tracks \"Mr. & Misdemeanor\" and \"Refrigerator Heaven\" were both later included in the well-received compilation album \"The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper\". \"Refrigerator Heaven\" was also included in the Warner Bros. compilation album \"Zapped\", which showcased acts signed or produced by Frank Zappa. The closing track \"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\", which was originally written and recorded as a demo by the band when it was called Nazz, begins with a sample of Tom Smothers saying \"You are the only censor; if you don't like what I'm saying, you have a choice: you can turn me off\". This is followed by an instrumental jam and finishes with the chorus from the demo. (The last part of the song is listed on the \"Science Fiction\" album as \"I've Written Home to Mother\", while the instrumental jam section is listed as \"For Alice\" or \"An Instrumental\".\n\nDetroit-born vocalist Vincent Furnier co-formed the Earwigs in the mid-1960s in Phoenix, Arizona. The band released a few singles and went through a few name changes before settling on a lineup with guitarist Glen Buxton, guitarist and keyboardist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith. In 1968 the band adopted the name Alice Cooper—a name Furnier later adopted as his own—and presented a story that it came from a 17th-century witch whose name they learned from a session with a ouija board.\n\nAt some point Buxton painted circles under his eyes with cigarette ashes, and soon the rest followed with ghoulish black makeup and outlandish clothes. The band moved to Los Angeles and became known for its provocative, theatrical shock rock stage show. In an incident during a performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in 1969, Cooper threw a live chicken into the audience, who tore it to shreds.\n\nThe band auditioned for Frank Zappa's Straight Records label, and Zappa signed them with a $6000 advance. The group's released its first album, the psychedelic \"Pretties for You\", in 1969 on Straight. It sold poorly.\n\nAccording to Alice Cooper's band manager, Shep Gordon, the band's record label wouldn't use the production tapes from producer David Briggs. Instead, the label opted to use the band's rehearsal tapes in the final cut of the album.\n\nCooper and Dunaway were fond of the musical film \"West Side Story\", and quotes from the film appear in the song \"Still No Air\" (\"got a rocket in your pocket\", \"when you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way); another quote gives the album its title.\n\nThe album appeared in 1970 with a cover on which the band poses turned away from the camera, their uncovered backs exposed except where covered with their long hair. A radio commercial that accompanied the album's release touted the band as \"unisex, raw, together, and violent—just like you, fellow American\".\n\nThe staff of \"Rolling Stone\" did not like the album, stating that \"there's nothing nearly that interesting\" and that \"the pretty stuff sounds like something Walt Disney had the good sense to leave in the can\". Robert Christgau, in \"The Village Voice\", rated it a C, explaining that it has very few of the \"pseudo-decadent and -psychedelic charms\" shown on \"Pretties for You\", along with \"tuneless singing, tuneless playing, tuneless tunes, and pseudo-musique concrete\".\n\nThe music showed little of the hard rock the band became famous for; the songs on its first two albums are more reminiscent of the pop-rock and psychedelia of bands such as mid-1960s the Who and Jefferson Airplane. They failed to find an audience and sold poorly. The group moved to Detroit, and with the next album, \"Love It to Death\", producer Bob Ezrin had them strip down their sound and simplify the songwriting; the album and its first single, \"I'm Eighteen\" were the first in a string of big successes.\n\nAllMusic's Joe Viglione feels that the album \"might be the perfect picture of an evolving Alice Cooper Group\". And that it \"gives evidence that Cooper has more of a voice than he got credit for\". He concludes by saying: \"That this band could run the gamut from [Frank] Zappa to [David] Bowie, and perhaps inspired both, makes \"Easy Action\" a good study and entertaining record.\"\n\nAll songs written by Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith.\n\n\n\nwith:\n\n"}

The Noongar people treat it with foreboding and prefer to avoid its rocky ridges, which are woven with tales of malevolent witches. The mountain is often shrouded in a mist which curls around the peaks and floats into the gullies.

When both the continents began to separate a rift gradually opened. In the first stage of rifting, it began to open in the west, then later the eastern section began to open. The two continents pivoted slightly at a point in the west, which squeezed the sediments at the western end of the break against the Yilgarn block, which forced the sediments up to form the range.

The parish includes the settlement of Almodington.\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon charter of AD 780 names a piece of land as 'Earnaleach and Tielesora' that was given to the church of St Paul. Then in a charter, dated AD930, King Æthelstan granted to Bishop Beornheah of Selsey, land at Medmerry in Selsey 'with the woodland and fields lying therewith called Erneleia'.\n\nHistorically Earnley was situated in the hundred of \"La Manwode\" or \"Manwood\", now known under the form Manhood. The name \"La Manwode\" means 'the common wood' and extended round Hundredsteddle Farm, where the boundaries of the Witterings, Birdham, and Earnley coincide. \"Hundredsteddle\" was the meeting place for the hundred moot and other hundred business.The name \"Hundredsteddle\" refers to the floor on which the \"Hundred court\" would have sat. It lay in the ancient pre-Conquest division of Sussex known as the Rape (county subdivision) of Chichester.\nThe Domesday survey does not include Earnley, however it is possible that at that time it was included in Wittering. The mediæval lords of the manor here belonged to the Ernle, Ernley, or Erneley family, and derived their surname from a manor they held in this parish.

He meets writer Greg Janello (Tony Goldwyn), and when his flight resumes boarding, Buddy gives his ticket to Greg so he can get home to his sons, 8-year-old Scott (Alex D. Linz) and 4-year-old Joey (David Dorfman). Buddy convinces his friend and airline employee Janice Guerrero (Jennifer Grey) to allow Greg to take his place on the flight. While spending the night with fellow stranded passenger Mimi (Natasha Henstridge), Buddy sees on television that the flight crashed. He has Janice check into the computer system to remove his name from the passenger manifest and add Greg's name. \n\nGreg's 29-year-old wife Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow) is woken up by news of the crash, and for many hours is torn between hope and despair, clinging to the belief that Greg would still arrive on the later flight on which he was originally booked, until his death is confirmed.\n\nOnce back in L.A., the airline dictates that Buddy run a series of innocuous ads to ameliorate the tragic consequences of the crash, which win a Clio award. Plagued with guilt, Buddy makes a drunken scene at the awards show, and begins a stint in Alcoholics Anonymous. One of the steps in recovery is to make up for past misdeeds, so Buddy seeks out Abby, a budding realtor, giving her a tip on a commercial office building that Jim (Joe Morton), Buddy's partner and boss, has put a bid on. In return, Abby treats Buddy to a night at Dodger Stadium. Their relationship blossoms, even as Buddy does not tell her about being indirectly responsible for Greg's death. \n\nWhen the airline settles with Greg's estate, Abby next wants to put her boys on an aircraft to Palm Springs to get over their fear of flying. Buddy asks to go along with them, and soon develops a strong bond with the two boys.

Abby is devastated by Buddy lying to her and demands that he leave her home and her life - though also demands that he say goodbye to the boys. Buddy comes back the next day and talks to Scott, who is afraid that his father died trying to get home for a Boy Scouts Christmas tree outing. Abby harbors the same guilt for pressuring Greg to come home on the fateful flight. \n\nThe victims' families sue the airline for damages, and Janice's role is revealed when Buddy is called to testify. As Abby watches on television, Buddy explains that he gave his ticket to Greg and did not take Greg's in exchange. In coercing Janice to change the roster, the airline's security procedures were compromised, which gets her fired. Buddy is excused by the judge, but still feels guilty.\n\nBuddy resigns from his firm, having compromised his client, the airline. Abby comes by to tell him that his talk with Scott had helped them both. Buddy, sensing that Abby is about to leave, asks her to help him rent his beachfront home or put it up for sale.

The Jenkins Activity Survey is a psychometric survey of behavior and attitude designed to identify persons showing signs of Type A behavior. The test is multiple choice and self-administered. It was published in 1979 by C. David Jenkins, Stephen Zyzanski, and Ray Rosenman. The terms Type A and Type B personality were originally described in the work of Rosenman and Friedman in 1959. The Jenkins Activity Survey was developed in an attempt to duplicate the clinical assessment of the Type A behavior pattern by employing an objective psychometric procedure. Individuals displaying a Type A behavior pattern are characterized by extremes of competitiveness, striving for achievement and personal recognition, aggressiveness, haste, impatience, explosiveness and loudness in speech, characteristics which the Jenkins Activity Survey attempts to measure. A popular sub-form of the Jenkins Activity Survey is form T, created to analyze Type A and Type B behavior in students as opposed to the original survey created with questions pertaining to the workforce.\n\nForm T of the Jenkins activity survey is a subform of the original Jenkins activity survey that utilizes the same methods and procedures as the Jenkins activity survey Form B, the adult version, but with questions altered to relate to student life as opposed to questions relating to occupational work (Bishop, 1989). This form was created in 1974 by Krantz, Glass, and Snyder to distinguish between Type A and Type B students and the differences among them relating to their school performance as well as gender differences and countless others. This form has been used in research not only to find information from students (Rainey, 1985) but also to test the reliability of Form T and subsequently the Jenkins Activity Survey as a whole (Bishop, 1989). Testing the reliability of this form is fundamental because although the changes made from the original survey were minor they could still have large effects in the overall scores and findings of the research. Research conducted by Bishop, Hailey, and O’Rourke in 1989 built off of previous research through using scores of those that were not found to be strongly Type A or Type B. In these cases, individuals who scored one standard deviation above the mean were classified as Type A and those one standard deviation below Type B. In this research, that utilized a test-retest approach, they were able to find reliable and statistically significant correlations between the first test and subsequent tests administered at the beginning of each of four semesters. These findings conclude the reliability of the test and add to other findings of the reliability of the overall Jenkins activity survey.\n\n"}

He is a novelist who is about to direct the screen adaptation of his most recent bestseller; she is an actress he has opted not to cast in the lead role, despite the fact it's partly based on her, because he feels she's too old for the part. This decision, coupled with an ongoing dispute about their barking dog Otis with their strait-laced, non-industry neighbors, clean-and-sober writer Ryan and interior decorator Monica Rose, has resulted in an undercurrent of tension between the two as they prepare for the arrival of their guests.\n\nAmong them are aging actor Cal Gold, Sally's co-star in the romantic comedy film she presently is shooting, his wife Sophia, and their two young children; director Mac Forsyth, who is helming Sally and Cal's film, and his anorexic, neurotic wife Clair; photographer Gina Taylor, whose relationship with Joe prior to his marriage and ongoing close friendship since troubles Sally; business manager Jerry Adams and his wife Judy; eccentric violinist Levi Panes; Jeffrey, Joe's roommate - and lover - at Oxford; and up-and-coming actress Skye Davidson, whom Joe has cast in the role Sally believes deservedly is hers. In an effort to dispel the simmering animosity between them and their neighbors, Sally and Joe have invited the Roses as well.\n\nThe early part of the evening is devoted to charades and lighthearted entertainment. Following a series of toasts offered by the guests, Joe distributes the ecstasy Skye brought them as a gift. As it begins to take effect, the night deteriorates, accusations are made, secrets are revealed, and relationships slowly unravel. Complicating emotions triggered by the drug are the disappearance of Otis and a phone call from Joe's father bringing tragic news about his beloved sister Lucy.\n\n\nIn an episode of the Sundance Channel series \"Anatomy of a Scene\", the filmmakers discussed the project at length. Because of conflicting schedules, there was a period of only 19 days in which the entire cast—consisting of friends and actors with whom Leigh and Cumming previously had worked—would be available for filming. This prompted the decision to film using digital video, which Leigh felt also added a sense of immediacy and intimacy that would draw the audience into the action as party guests observing everything from the sidelines.\n\nThe order in which the toasts were made was determined before the scene was filmed, although with the exception of that offered by Skye, they were improvised rather than scripted.\n\nRetired actress Phoebe Cates returned to acting for this one film, as a favor to director Leigh, her best friend.\n\nThe film's soundtrack includes \"I Know a Place\" by Petula Clark, \"I May Never Go Home Anymore\" by Marlene Dietrich, \"Comin' Home Baby\" by Mel Tormé, \"There Is No Greater Love\" and \"A Lot of Livin' to Do\" by Sammy Davis Jr., \"Stealing My Love from Me\" by Lulu, \"Troubles\" by Blair Tefkin and the Adagio from the Sonata No. 1 in G minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival in May prior to its limited release in the US the following month. It grossed $4,047,329 in the US and $884,559 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $4,931,888.\n\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", Stephen Holden called it \"an articulate, acutely observant film [that] makes you realize how starved Hollywood movies are for great ensemble acting . . . the movie has such finely woven performances that the best scenes project a convincing illusion of spontaneity . . . Ms. Leigh and Mr. Cumming's screenplay does an amazing job of creating about a dozen fully rounded, nuanced characters with a minimum of words. The dialogue, though it comes quickly and in scraps, is so juicy that the zest with which the actors bite into it suggests they invented it themselves . . . This isn't Chekhov, by any stretch of the imagination. The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isn't all-embracing. Yet despite its shortcomings, this smart, caustic movie is easily the most incisive and realistic comedy of manners to emerge from Hollywood in quite a while, and that's saying a lot.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" observed, \"The appeal of the film is largely voyeuristic. We learn nothing we don't already more or less know, but the material is covered with such authenticity and unforced natural conviction that it plays like a privileged glimpse into the sad lives of the rich and famous. We're like the neighbors who are invited. Leigh and Cumming...are confident professionals who don't indulge their material or themselves. This isn't a confessional home movie, but a cool and intelligent look at a lifestyle where smart people are required to lead their lives according to dumb rules.\"\n\nIn the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle said, \"Leigh and Cumming save the best roles for themselves, and both their roles reach major emotional crescendos. Yet to their credit, with all the video in the world at their disposal and nobody to rein them in, they don't indulge themselves. They're both brilliant, spot-on and wonderfully true. \"The Anniversary Party\" is probably one of those miracles that can happen only once. Still one can't help hoping that Leigh and Cumming collaborate on another film.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" stated, \"The final result should be a self-indulgent mess - and, in truth, the final third of the film comes close. But until Leigh and Cumming let their actorly urge for high drama blunt their flair for bracing wit and subtle feeling, they turn what could have been an acting stunt into an intimate and compelling study of bruised emotions . . .

He is remembered for his work on the stratigraphy of the Himalayas. He helped establish geological studies and investigations in India, specifically at the Institute of Himalayan Geology, which was renamed in 1976 after him as the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology. His textbook on the Geology of India, first published in 1919, continues to be in use.\n\nWadia was born at Surat in Gujarat, the fourth of nine children of Nosherwan and Gooverbai Wadia on 23 October 1883. They belonged to Parsi family who had traditionally been shipbuilders and another member of this community included Ardaseer Cursetjee, the first Indian elected Fellow of the Royal Society. Nosherwan Wadia worked as a station master in the Indian Railways at Bombay, Baroda and Central India. Young Wadia received his early schooling in a private school at Surat and later at Sir J. J. English School before the family moved to Baroda in 1894 where he went to Baroda High School. The interest in science was instilled by his oldest brother, Munchershaw N. Wadia who was an educationist in the princely state of Baroda. At 16 years, he moved to Baroda College, where he was influenced by Adarji M. Masani the professor of natural history and Aravind Ghosh. He obtained a BSc degree in 1903 in botany and zoology and another BSc degree in 1905 in botany and geology. A noted educationist in Baroda State, who gave him his abiding love of science, devotion to knowledge, and a rational outlook upon human relationships, all of which were to dominate his subsequent career. The study in geology was helped by the geological collections that were made under Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaekwar. In 1905 he graduated with a M.A. in biology and geology and began to teach undergraduates. Education in geology in India at that time was restricted to the Universities of Calcutta and Madras where officers of the Geological Survey of India sometimes acted as part-time lecturers. At the age of 23, Wadia obtained the post of a Professor of Geology at the Prince of Wales College at Jammu and continued to work there for the next fourteen years.\n\nWadia found the college very supportive. The location also allowed him to make geological studies in the adjoining region. In 1909 he married Miss Alan G. Contractor. They had a daughter who died in infancy. He spent vacations in the Himalayan region, collecting rocks and fossils. In 1919 he published a textbook of Geology for students, the first new work after the \"Manual of geology in India\" which had been revised in 1893. Several editions (sixth in 1966) were to be produced later and this continues to be a major text in Indian geology. In 1925 he discovered tusks and fragments of the extinct elephant-like animal already described as \"Stegodon ganesa\".\n\nIn 1920, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) expanded from 20 to 32 scientific officers. In 1921, a post was offered to Wadia, then aged 37. He was not the first Indian to join the Survey, but was the first who did not have a degree from a European university. His early work was on the geology of the Himalayas and it involved careful field work and mapping. He collected numerous Middle and Upper Cambrian trilobites which were studied by F R C Reed in 1934. He also found Upper Triassic plant fossils and Eocene Foraminifera leading to revisions of the map of the region. When he visited the Survey headquarters at Calcutta, he lectured at the Presidency College, then under the University of Calcutta. After G. E. Pilgrim's retirement in 1928, Wadia became the Paleontologist at the GSI and continued in that post until 1935. When Wadia left the GSI in 1938, it was in the rank of Assistant Superintendent, the same one in which he had joined.\n\nAfter retiring from the GSI in 1938, Wadia took up an offer from the Government of Ceylon for the post of Mineralogist. This position had earlier been held by J.S. Coates but not filled since 1935. He worked on many aspects of the geology of Sri Lanka. Wadia's first wife, Alan (married in 1909), daughter of G.P. Contractor, died in Kashmir in the mid 1930s and he married Meher Gustadji K. Medivala at Colombo in 1940.\n\nWadia returned to India in 1945. In 1947, he became and advisor to the government led by Jawaharlal Nehru. At a meeting he suggested that India should move away from a \"lukewarm, hesitating and even patronising\" attitude to science and bring about co-operation among Indian scientists to help in tapping \"the basic sources of wealth and well-being, yet imperfectly tapped in land, man-power, its rivers, forests, minerals and electric power\". In 1948, Homi Jehangir Bhabha who was associated with the creation of the Indian Atomic Energy Act invited Wadia in 1949 to help survey for raw materials for use in reactors.atomic energy. This led to the extraction of thorium and uranium ores in Kerala, Bihar and Rajasthan.\n\nWadia worked on Himalayan stratigraphy, dating various sections and understanding the age and origin of the ranges. He studied the fossils of the Siwaliks, examining the collections at the British Museum along with A T Hopwood and W E Swinton around 1926–27. The Trigonometrical Survey of India had found discrepancies in measurements based on triangulation and those made using astronomy observations. This was described in 1855 by Archdeacon J. H. Pratt of Calcutta and is now called the Bouguer anomaly which he explained on the basis of isostasy. Others like Airy suggested that it was due to light rocks below the Himalayas while Glennie suggested a crust warp as a cause in 1930. Wadia reviewed this matter in 1938 and suggested that it required further work to resolve the debate. Another topic that interested him was the age of the Salt Range which had been suggested as either Cambrian, Pre-Cambrian or Eocene. Birbal Sahni and his fellow researchers reported angiosperms and insect fossils. Wadia suggested that there was some thrust of Cambrian plates over Eocene plates in some areas. Wadia took an interest in soil science. In 1954, he suggested that the Pleistocene Ice Age of the northern hemisphere was a time of great rainfall (the Pluvial Age) in the semi-tropical and tropical latitudes. One of his early contributions was to explain the knee-bend or syntaxis in the mountain ranges around Nanga Parbat.\n\nWadia presided over numerous committees and was on the editorial board of several journals. Wadia received numerous awards for his work. The Back Award from the Royal Geographical Society in 1934, the Lyell Medal from the Geological Society of London in 1943, the Joyakishan Medal from the Indian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1944, the Jagdish Bose Memorial Medal from the Royal Asiatic Society in 1947, an honorary degree of D.Sc. from the University of Delhi in 1947, the Nehru Medal of the National Geographic Society and the Padma Bhushan from India in 1958. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1957.\n\nIn 1951, a 2 Anna Indian postage stamp to commemorate the centenary of the Geological Survey of India illustrated \"Stegodon ganesa\" was released. In 1984 an Indian postal stamp with a portrait of Wadia was issued.\n\n"}

Aburi has a population of 18,701 people as of 2013.\n\nAburi is north east of Accra, and the journey from Accra to Aburi is about 45 mins (will be less when the dual carriage road from Tetteh Quarshie Circle to Adenta Barrier is completed by 2014). Due to the altitude of Aburi, the climate is a lot cooler than neighbouring Accra. The road which climbs the hillside to Aburi is a toll road, with the current toll being 0.50 Ghc for a car, 1.00 Ghc for a 4x4. There is a higher charge for vans and lorries. From the road most of Greater Accra is visible below, although the one stopping space for pictures on this section of road has a \"No Stopping\" sign.\n\nAburi has several primary education, secondary education, higher education and further education institutions and Aburi is home to Aburi Presbyterian Technical Secondary School, which is linked to The Sixth Form College, Farnborough in Hampshire, England.\nAburi is also home to Aburi Girls' Senior High School started by the Presbyterian church. Aburi also hosts the Great Adonten senior High School.\nFor post secondary education, you can find the Presbyterian women's college of Education, formally known as PWTC Training college.\n\nThe name Aburi is the adulterated version of ABUDE by the European missionaries and traders. \nBecause of Aburi's location in the mountains of Ghana and its proximity to the coast of Ghana, an agricultural research farm was set up near Aburi by British residents in 1891. The area of the garden originally consisted of 20 hectares, in 1901 there were 17.8 hectares and in 1902 came to more than 40 hectares of new acquisitions, which was discovered during the last expansion with considerable resistance. Ultimately, the expansion could take place only through the application of governmental authority over state expropriation. The purpose of the Botanical Garden was originally to test field-building opportunities and to develop, which contributes to greater financial independence of Ghana. The focus of the garden was primarily in culture experiments with indigenous crops such as cocoa, rubber plants and cola. In addition, there were also ornamental and fruit plants grown of various kinds and small field trials with cotton and spices, vanilla and pepper mainly on cardamom and nutmeg. An inventory, dated 21 July 1900, lists 350 different plant species grown in Aburi. In addition, there was in 1903 in the center of the garden, a sanatorium. In 1901 the expenditure was for the garden equivalent of 44,312 marks (then German marks). Especially for the cotton experiments, a cotton planter expert from the United States (Texas) named Edmund Fisher, was employed, and who was, however, unfavorable for cotton in the rain forest, which is located in Aburi, which had only a few small test plots. A larger cotton research station was built on Edmund Fisher's recommendation in the grasslands by the Volta River built, and grown where cotton is the native culture from time immemorial and the cotton were made into clothing. It is not only an experimental farm that was established, but also tries to cheer up the locals to expand their cotton production. The latter was accomplished mainly through the distribution of seeds to the chiefs in connection with a purchase guarantee for all cotton harvested in a central market in buying at (9 ' N, 0 ° 6 ' O) on the Volta, where the cotton could be accommodated easily by water. In the Volta River could then also be the removal of the cotton. The most distant of the cotton growing area in Eastern region, is the landscape area which is about 13–15 km from the Volta River. It has also been used for treatment of raw cotton and where the Ginstation was built.\n\nToday, on the grounds of the only botanical garden in Aburi, Ghana, is mainly home to many plants that were not originally native to Eastern region, but there is a collection of tropical plants that have been added.\n\nAburi is host to one of the finest wood markets not only in Ghana but in Africa. Aburi has been rumoured that goods manufactured at the Aburi markets have found their way to South Africa to be sold on to tourists.\n\nAburi Botanical Gardens is result of a well known Ghanaian tourist destination.\n\nAburi is home to many beautiful resorts and lodges one can stay at during a visit. Hillbury resort and Peduase Valley Resort are two of the notable hotels in this region.\n\nPeduase is the location of a Presidential summer residence ('Peduase Lodge') built and first used by Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah.It was used in the second republic of Ghana as the official residence of the then Ceremonial President, Edward Akufo-Addo.Since then it has not been permanently resided in by any Ghanaian head-of-state. Peduase Lodge is still used as a Presidential accommodation for the state of Ghana guests. \nThe Presidential Lodge is in Peduase, a town near Kitase on the road to Aburi.\n\nAburi is the birthplace of, or home to, several notable people, including:\n\n\n"}

The spot was close to the Eriksgata, the road that the king travelled after having been elected at the Stone of Mora, in order to be accepted by his subjects. The stone was sold for 50 Swedish kronor in 1896 to the founder of Skansen, Artur Hazelius, where it was moved. It remains at Skansen to this day.\n\nThe inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The inscription is signed by the runemaster Åsmund Kåresson, who was active during the first half of the eleventh century in Uppland. Over twenty other inscriptions are listed in Rundata as being signed by Åsmund including U 301 in Skånela, the now-lost U 346 in Frösunda, U 356 in Ängby, the now-lost U 368 in Helgåby, U 824 in Holm, U 847 in Västeråker, U 859 in Måsta, U 884 in Ingla, U 932 at Uppsala Cathedral, U 956 in Vedyxa, U 969 in Bolsta, the now-lost U 986 in Kungsgården, U 998 in Skällerö, U 1142 in Åbyggeby, U 1144 in Tierp, U 1149 in Fleräng, U Fv1986;84 in Bo gård, U Fv1988;241 in Rosersberg, Gs 11 in Järvsta, Gs 12 in Lund, and Gs 13 in Söderby.

{"id": "2216840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216840", "title": "Headbangers Ball", "text": "Headbangers Ball\n\nHeadbangers Ball was a music television program consisting of heavy metal music videos airing on MTV, MTV2 (its sister channel), MTV Australia, MTV Rocks (formerly known as MTV2 Europe), MTV Adria (the MTV subsidiary covering the former Yugoslavia), MTV Brand New, MTV Portugal, MTV Finland, MTV Arabia, MTV Norway, MTV Sweden, MTV Denmark, MTV Greece, MTV Türkiye, MTV Israel, MTV Hungary, MTV Japan; MTV Brasil aired a program with a similar premise, named \"Fúria Metal\". The show began on MTV on April 18, 1987, playing heavy metal and hard rock music videos late at night, from both well-known and more obscure artists. The show offered (and became famous because of) a stark contrast to Top 40 music videos shown during the day.\n\nHowever, with the mainstream rise of alternative rock, grunge, pop punk and rap music in the 1990s, the relevance of \"Headbangers Ball\" came into question, and the show was ultimately canceled in 1995. Over eight years later, as new genres of heavy metal were gaining a commercial foothold and fan interest became unavoidable, the program was reintroduced on MTV2. It has remained in varying degrees on the network's website, but is no longer shown on television.\n\nMany of the videos that aired on the first incarnation of the series would find a home on the similarly themed \"Metal Mayhem\" on sister channel MTV Classic.\n\n\"\"The Ball\",\" as it is commonly called, replaced \"Heavy Metal Mania\" (which began airing monthly in June 1985), helmed by Dee Snider of Twisted Sister fame. In doing so, MTV expanded the format and added more live interviews with bands. At its premiere it was hosted briefly by Kevin Seal, then by VJ Adam Curry, before ultimately settling on Riki Rachtman, who to many viewers became the most identifiable host of the show.\n\nThe name \"Headbangers Ball\" was originally invented and used by DJ John Brent of Bury, Lancashire and was used on his rock and metal roadshows from 1980 onwards and toured throughout the UK with great success. John's Headbangers Ball Rock charts were also regularly featured in the pages of Rock publications \"Kerrang!\" and \"Sounds\" along with many features on the show in local periodicals.\n\n\"Headbangers Ball\" was one of the most popular music shows ever to air on MTV, on the air for nearly 8 years, and for a time, it was one of the network's flagship shows. For some time in 1988 and 1989, the show was increased to 3 hours. One hour added, plus \"Hard 60\", a daily version of the ball that aired for an hour every weekday afternoon.\n\nIts influence was made widespread with the rise of heavy metal in the 1980s and early 1990s. While the program primarily showed videos from the mainstream friendly \"hair metal\" during the 1980s, it gave an equal amount of time to the often more aggressive-sounding heavy metal music scene active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This level of popularity also resulted in North American tours presented by Headbangers Ball; one took place in 1987 and featured Helloween, Armored Saint and Grim Reaper, while the lineup of the 1989 tour consisted of Anthrax, Exodus and Helloween and the 1992 version had Megadeth and Suicidal Tendencies. Heavier alternative acts, spearheaded by the likes of The Cult, Faith No More, Primus and Jane's Addiction, were finding increased residence on \"Headbangers Ball\" at the turn of the decade, but it was early into the 1990s that grunge and alternative rock bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains began to uproot the \"hair metal\" scene and led to its final decline. Bands such as Stone Temple Pilots, White Zombie, Tool and Blind Melon would follow suit, resulting in a major shift in identity for the show, where metal mainstays such as Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Testament, Suicidal Tendencies and Dream Theater shared airspace with the new crop of alternative hard rock acts. Several punk rock bands, including the Ramones, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion and Sick of It All, also received airplay on the show, which, by 1995, would continue to focus on less mainstream forms of heavy metal.\n\nOther notable TV programs have emulated \"Headbanger's Ball\", such as Fuse TV's \"Uranium\" and VH1's \"Rock Show\". Indeed, the popularity and effectiveness of \"Uranium\" in the early 2000s (decade) may be cited as a strong influence to the revival of \"The Ball\" in 2003.\n\nBands would visit the set for interviews, and in some instances, the show would follow bands on trips to assorted locations across the world. Memorable road trip episodes include the Moscow Music Peace Festival with Ozzy Osbourne, Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, Skid Row, Cinderella and Gorky Park, Monsters of Rock in Donington, Alice in Chains' trip to Action Water Park, bowling with Soundgarden, skydiving with Megadeth, Oktoberfest in Munich with Danzig and Van Halen's adventure at Cabo Wabo.\n\nThe show remained on the air until January 1995, when MTV abruptly canceled the show without any prior warning to viewers, host Riki Rachtman, or the production staff. The European version, hosted by Vanessa Warwick, was on the air until 1997, but limited to an hour and a half (as opposed to the three hours given in past years).\n\nRachtman was informed of the cancellation days afterward when, after filming what would end up being the final episode, he was simply informed via phone call that he would not have to show up to work the following week. No official reason was given for the show's cancellation, but it is suspected to be because MTV was then playing grunge and alternative more often during its main programming, although they did not play a lot of metal or interview the bands.\n\nMany MTV fans were outraged at the show's abrupt cancellation, as well as denying Rachtman and the production staff the chance to inform viewers that the show was going off the air, or to allow them to put together a \"farewell show\" for the loyal viewers of \"Headbangers Ball\". Some regular-citizen critics of MTV even cite the cancellation of \"Headbangers Ball\" as one of the key decisions which caused the network to \"jump the shark\". The demise of \"The Ball\" also came in at #4 on VH1's \"40 Least Metal Moments\" in 2005. In mid-February The Ball would be replaced by the short lived \"Superock\", a show featuring videos and interviews with metal, alternative and rap artists.\n\nOver the years, MTV Europe attempted to fill the void left by the cancellation of \"Headbangers Ball\" with other rock-themed block programs such as the Julia Valet hosted \"Superock\", but all have failed for various reasons – including MTV Europe's addition of pop, dance and alternative videos to some of the shows which made them not much different from the rest of the day.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of the show being off the air, MTV2 started up the series again on Saturday, May 10, 2003 at 11 p.m. The revived \"Headbangers Ball\" initially had the same type of playlist as its latter \"sister shows\" in MTV Europe, as well as interviews with metal artists (current and classic). The debut episode was hosted by Metallica, a trend which continued with various artists. Later on, Hatebreed vocalist Jamey Jasta became a permanent host. However, the show still continued to have guest host artists at times. The show eventually returned to its roots (in types of music) of showing underground music, as well as metalcore, death metal and thrash.\n\nDuring VH1's \"40 Least Metal Moments\" countdown, musicians criticized the 2003 incarnation of \"Headbangers Ball\" in comparison with the original, citing its \"scripted\" studio feel and lack of excitement. The new version mostly shows only music videos and in-studio interviews, which was not true of the original show.\n\nWhen asked in September 2015 about a possible return of \"Headbangers Ball\", former host Riki Rachtman stated, \"It's not gonna happen. I tried, I told them I would do it for free, they never even returned my calls.\"\n\nAlthough the show is currently no longer on the air, there have been European tours called \"MTV Headbangers Ball\" since 2016; this tour package traditionally takes place from late November to mid-December, and features four metal bands. The European \"MTV Headbangers Ball\" tour has included mostly thrash metal bands such as Exodus, Overkill, Death Angel, Sodom and Suicidal Angels ‒ as well as other acts like Max + Igor Cavalera, Iced Earth, Kataklysm, Insomnium, Ensiferum, Unearth, Deserted Fear, Whitechapel, Fleshgod Apocalypse and Dyscarnate ‒ as a headlining or opening act; the only band so far that has taken part of the tour more than once is Kataklysm.\n\nSince the January 13, 2007, episode, \"Headbangers Ball\" simply became the title for a block of metal videos, rather than an actual show. However, the June 23, 2007, episode went behind the scenes of the induction of Pantera guitarist \"Dimebag\" Darrell Abbott at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, including segments covering the event in between music videos. Also, brief interview segments still frequently air before and after commercial breaks, typically re-airing on several consecutive episodes for a long period.\n\nOn April 14, 2007, MTV2 began to air the show from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. and put \"Saturday Rock the Deuce\", a hard rock–alternative show, at 10. The week's episode was also re-aired on Tuesday mornings from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.\n\nStarting in 2008, \"Headbangers Ball\" had been aired erratically, sometimes airing several hours later than its normal airtime or not being aired at all. Its last on-air time slot was Tuesdays 3AM-4AM.\n\nSince July 21, 2011, Jose Mangin took over as host of \"Headbangers Ball\", which is now a web only show.\n\n\"Headbangers Ball\" labeled products, including a guitar tabs book and three CD sets including artists such as Hatebreed, Opeth, DevilDriver, God Forbid, Chimaira, Dirge Within, Sevendust, Lacuna Coil, Atreyu, Mushroomhead, Shadows Fall, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, A Life Once Lost, Cradle of Filth, Deftones, and Godsmack have also been sold.\n\nEach album has at least one live song. The first \"Headbangers Ball\" compilation featured \"Raining Blood\" by Slayer as its live track, the second compilation used an in-studio performance of \"My Tortured Soul\" by Probot, and the latest compilation had two live tracks: \"A Bid Farewell\" by Killswitch Engage and \"Now You've Got Something To Die For\" by Lamb of God. The earliest-released CD has famous bands, and the second has obscure ones. Songs featuring Slipknot band members Corey Taylor and Joey Jordison appeared on all three CDs through their other bands. Other bands that have appeared on all three compilations include Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, and In Flames.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Vaughan Media, LLC; Nexstar Media Group, which owns Dayton-licensed NBC affiliate WDTN (channel 2), operates WBDT under a local marketing agreement (LMA). The two stations share studios on South Dixie Drive in Moraine (with a Dayton mailing address). However, master control and some internal operations for WBDT and WDTN are based within centralcasting facilities of former sister station WISH-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana. There is no separate website for WBDT; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WDTN.\n\nWBDT, along with unrelated Richmond, Indiana-licensed Ion Television owned-and-operated station WKOI-TV (channel 43), share WDTN's digital channel from WDTN's transmitter facility on Frytown Road in southwest Dayton.\n\nOn cable, WBDT is available on Charter Spectrum channel 13. The station also serves as the default CW affiliate for the Lima market, which had been served by cable-only affiliate West Central Ohio CW until early 2010.\n\nChannel 26 first appeared in southwest Ohio on July 14, 1968 as independent WSWO-TV, under the ownership of Southwestern Ohio Television. WSWO-TV ran a local live version of \"Bozo the Clown\" (portrayed by announcer Dave Eaton, who was previously with the former WKTR-TV in Kettering, now PBS member station WPTD [channel 16]), as well as other local shows. The station suddenly went dark on June 19, 1970, after it lost a bid to obtain the ABC affiliation for Dayton to WKEF (channel 22); it soon thereafter filed for bankruptcy.\n\nWSWO-TV briefly returned to the air on June 17, 1972 under the ownership of Lester W. White, but fell silent again at the beginning of December after White defaulted on a loan. White was additionally discovered to have stolen equipment from multiple television stations, most notably WHIZ-TV in Zanesville, and arrested two days before a court ordered the station closed.\n\nThe current incarnation of channel 26 dates from September 7, 1980, when Miami Valley Christian Television (MVCT) returned it to the air as a Christian-oriented station under the call sign WTJC (for Witnessing 'Til Jesus Comes). WTJC aired religious programming during most of its daytime and weekend schedule (including \"The 700 Club\", \"PTL\" and \"Jerry Falwell\") although it also aired lifestyle programming such as \"The Joy of Gardening\", cartoons, and children's programming in late weekday afternoon slots (including \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\", \"Porky Pig\", \"The Great Space Coaster\" and \"New Zoo Revue\"). There were also family-friendly reruns in early evenings (among them \"Leave It to Beaver\", \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon\" and \"Lassie\") and a local newscast. WTJC's Saturday schedule included westerns, sportsmen/hunting/wildlife shows (including \"Wild Kingdom\") and \"The Lawrence Welk Show\".\n\nWhen WRGT-TV signed on in 1984, MVCT sold most of its secular programming inventory to that station, and switched WTJC to a mostly-religious format (with the exception of a few children's shows, and Saturday morning sporting and hunting shows). Over the next few years, several ministries that bought time on WTJC became involved in scandals. Due to the scandals, donations to the ministries, and to MVCT, declined. The primary owner of MVCT, Marvin Sparks, bought out his partners' shares in 1991 and in turn sold them to Video Mall Communications. WTJC then aired home shopping and paid programming eighteen hours a day, with religious shows the rest of the broadcast day.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Abry Communications (which had purchased WRGT-TV's owner, Act III Broadcasting) approached MVCT with a proposal to manage WTJC for 18 hours a day. MVCT declined and chose instead to sell the station to Paxson Communications in 1995. Paxson kept a similar lineup for WTJC, airing religious programming in early mornings, infomercials for most of the day and worship music overnight. On January 20, 1998, WTJC's call sign was changed to WDPX (for Dayton PaX TV). Accordingly, on August 31 of that year, the station became a charter affiliate of Pax (now Ion Television).\n\nIn June 1999, Paxson sold the station to ACME Communications, which dropped half of Pax’s programming for a primary affiliation with The WB, along with syndicated programming. The previous WB affiliate was station WUCT-LP (now WRCX-LP); WB programming in the Dayton area could also be seen on the WGN cable channel and on Columbus WB affiliate WWHO. On June 9, 1999, ACME also changed WDPX's call sign to the current WBDT. ACME ran the station as a dual WB and Pax affiliate, signing a five-year affiliation deal with Pax upon the sale of the station from Paxson. As a dual WB and Pax affiliate, WBDT aired a mix of syndicated programming, WB network programming, and Pax TV programming (such as \"Touched by an Angel\", \"Diagnosis Murder\", \"Encounters with the Unexplained\", \"Promised Land\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and later \"Doc\" and \"Candid Camera\"). WBDT maintained a secondary affiliation with Pax until mid-2004 at the latest, airing its primetime lineup on weekday mornings from 9 a.m. to noon, early Sunday mornings from 1 to 4 a.m., and early Monday mornings from midnight to 4 a.m. In the station's early days as a WB affiliate, Pax's flagship \"Touched by an Angel\" continued to air at its regularly scheduled time of 7:00 p.m., leading into WB primetime programming. In 2004, \"Diagnosis Murder\" was moved to 1 p.m., while the remainder of Pax's programming was moved to overnights. The station finally dropped the remainder of Pax's programming in September 2004, filling the morning hours previously programmed with the network's programming with off-network sitcoms, talk shows, infomercials, and court shows.\n\nOn September 18, 2006, WBDT became the market's CW outlet after The WB and UPN merged. It became a strong affiliate with the new network in terms of primetime ratings—strong enough for The CW to designate WBDT the \"#1 CW affiliate\" in the nation in March 2007. In that same month, the station became the first in the area (and one of the few in the entire country) to broadcast in a 1080i high definition format 24 hours a day, broadcasting on digital UHF channel 18.\n\nOn June 4, 2010, it was announced that the LIN TV Corporation (owner of WDTN) would begin to operate WBDT through shared service and joint sales agreements. WBDT was to leave its longtime studios on Corporate Place, off Byers Road in Miamisburg, in October and move to WDTN's facility in Moraine. As of January 27, 2013, the former WBDT studio facility is now occupied by Sinclair Broadcast Group's duopoly of ABC affiliate WKEF and Fox affiliate WRGT-TV (the move made them the last network-affiliated stations in Dayton to have upgraded their local programming, including newscasts, to high definition).\n\nThree months after ACME and LIN TV reached their operations and sales agreements, LIN TV exercised an option to purchase WBDT along with another LIN TV-operated ACME station, fellow CW affiliate WCWF in Green Bay, Wisconsin. LIN TV requested that WBDT's license be assigned to a subsidiary of Vaughan Media (owner of Austin, Texas CW affiliate KNVA, which is also operated by LIN TV). LIN TV holds a 4.5% equity stake in Vaughan Media, but controls most of that company's voting stock, effectively making it a shell corporation for LIN TV. The FCC approved the sale and license transfer in April 2011; the commission also denied objections from area cable operators Time Warner Cable and Buckeye Cablevision, who claimed that retransmission fees for WBDT would increase as a result of the sale. The sale of WBDT was consummated on May 20, 2011.\n\nOn March 4, 2011, LIN TV's contract with Dish Network expired, and all TV stations owned or operated by LIN, including both WBDT and WDTN, were pulled from Dish. On March 13, LIN and Dish entered into a retransmission consent agreement, and all affected channels were restored.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would purchase LIN Media and its stations, including WDTN and the SSA and JSA with WBDT, in a $1.6 billion merger. The FCC approved the merger on December 12, 2014, but a condition of the deal requires Media General to end the JSA between WBDT and WDTN due to tighter scrutiny such deals are getting by the FCC. Media General received a two-year waiver to end the JSA between WDTN and WBDT. The merger was completed on December 19.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWBDT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 26, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to channel 26 for post-transition operations.\n\nInitially, WBDT aired a standard definition simulcast of its HD programming on its DT2 subchannel. After several months, this subchannel was dropped. On September 26, 2011, WBDT began airing Bounce TV on DT2, becoming a charter affiliate of the network. On November 30, 2015, WBDT added a third subchannel to carry Ion Television (the network was also added by other Media General stations); the station had carried Pax, the forerunner of Ion Television, as a secondary affiliate, ending in 2004. On February 1, 2018, Ion Television was moved to sister station WDTN's DT3 subchannel, replacing the Justice Network; WBDT's third subchannel was dropped.\n\nOn April 14, 2017, it was reported that WBDT's over-the-air spectrum had been sold in the FCC's spectrum reallocation auction, fetching $27.3 million, with the FCC listing the station as set to go off the air. However, Joe Abouzeid, president and general manager of the station, characterized the auction as an \"engineering exercise\" and stated that the station would not go off the air or move to a new channel.\n\nIn spite of the station manager's earlier denial, WBDT began sharing sister station WDTN's digital channel on June 29, 2018. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 26.\n\nStarting with the April 9, 2016 home opener, Dayton Dragons telecasts will appear on WBDT, which will air 25 home games per season.\n\nOn September 16, 2002, the nationally syndicated morning show, \"The Daily Buzz\", premiered from WBDT's studios. The program, then produced by then-parent ACME Communications, remained based at the station until its August 2004 move to the facilities of former sister station WKCF in Lake Mary, Florida near Orlando.\n\nOn August 18, 2007, WDTN began to produce a nightly half-hour primetime newscast for WBDT known as \"2 News at 10 on Dayton's CW\". On the 26th day of its broadcast, this show achieved higher ratings than WRGT-TV's nightly primetime news (produced by WKEF) in Dayton's metered market households.\n\nOn July 21, 2012, WDTN began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The WBDT shows were included in the upgrade.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, WBDT began airing a weekday news program from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., called \"2 News Today on Dayton's CW\". Since the cancellation of \"The Daily Buzz,\" the station also simulcasts the 5:00 to 7:00 a.m. WDTN edition as well. On September 9, 2013, WBDT expanded the primetime 10:00 p.m. WDTN-produced newscast to an hour.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2216859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216859", "title": "Ernle", "text": "Ernle\n\nErnle was the surname of an English gentry or landed family descended from the lords of the manor of Earnley in Sussex who derived their surname from the name of the place where their estates lay.\n\nOnomasticians say that the surname's origin, in being drawn from the name of a manor, is topographical in nature, and identical with the place name's origins. As such, it is derived from an Old English compound name composed of \"earn\" meaning \"eagle\" combined with \"leah\" meaning \"wood\". The name's meaning is interpreted as signifying a place to which eagles resort.\n\nThe earliest forms noted are \"Earneleach\", \"Earnaleagh\", \"Earnelegh\" found in a document dated 780 during the reign of Oslac, duke of the South Saxons. A later form, \"Earneleia\", derives from a charter of England's King Aethelstan dated 930. Other English place names deriving from the same two words are thought to include Earley, Berkshire and Areley Kings (otherwise Areley-on-Severn), formerly called Ernley, Worcestershire. The latter place is connected with Layamon, poet and historian, one of the earliest writers in the English tongue (\"The Beginnings of English Literature\", C.M. Lewis, 1900, p. 66):\n\n\"About the year 1205 an English 'Brut' was written. This was the work of Layamon, a parish priest of Ernley in Worcestershire. The opening lines give us the best information we have about him. Their metre should be noted. It is a relic of the Old English verse, each half-line (or each line, as here printed) containing two principal accents, and being more or less closely connected with its fellow. The poet, however, often omitted the alliteration; and the scribe, who attempted by marks of punctuation to show which half-lines belonged together, seems in consequence to have sometimes lost his way.\"\n\n\"An preost wes on leoden Laȝamon wes ihoten. He wes leouenaðes sone, liðe him beo drihten. He wonede at ernleȝe, at æðelen are chirechen. vppen seuarne staÞe, sel Þar him Þuhte. on fest Radestone Þer he bock radde. Hit com him on mode, & on his mern Þonke.\"\n\n[translation into Modern English]\n\n\"A priest was among the people who was called Layamon. He was Levenath's son. Gracious to him be the Lord. He dwelt at Ernly, at a noble church upon Severn's bank. Well there to him it seemed, fast by Radestone. There he read books.\"\n\nThe parish of Earnley lies on the southern coast of England in the county of Sussex, 4 miles (6.4 km) south-west of Chichester, the local cathedral city.\n\nIt formed part of the hundred of \"La Manwode\" or \"Manwood\", now found under the form \"Manhood\", which in turn took its name from a locality in the parish of Earnley. The parish and hundred lie in the original pre-Conquest Saxon division of Sussex known as the Rape of Chichester. The boundaries of the manor of Earnley and the parish of the same name are not strictly coterminous, as the manor itself was not contained within the parish borders, but included part of the neighbouring parish of West Wittering. Also, the parish of Earnley was enlarged in 1524, absorbing the former parish of Almodington, now a hamlet of Earnley parish. The resulting parish, held by a rector, is formally referred to as \"Earnley with Almodington\".\n\nDuring the Civil War and Interregnum, the parish of Earnley was united with East Wittering for the purposes of officially countenanced Presbyterian worship and oversight during the official suppression of Anglicanism. At the Restoration, which saw not just the return of the monarchy, but also of the Anglican Settlement, the parishes reverted to their separate status as in pre-Commonwealth times.\n\nHistorians trace the origins of this Sussex landed family to the latter part of the twelfth century. About 1190, \"Bertha de Lancinges\" confirmed an earlier charter for lands amounting to a quarter of a knight's fee less one virgate at Earnley, Sussex granted about a generation earlier, that is, circa 1166, by her father \"William de Lancinges\" and his wife \"Maud\" to his uncle, \"Lucas de Ernle\". This name simply means \"Luke of Earnley\". This man, whom historians call \"Luke de Ernle\", is the first known member of the family, and is the probable progenitor of all subsequent \"Ernle\"s, though it is not known whether he was actually the first person to be known by this designation.\n\nSince he is denominated as \"de Ernle\" in this document, it is quite likely that he or his family was already known and distinguished from others by the use of that \"sobriquet\" or surname. Since the grant of lands was given to him by a family member, it appears logical to assume that his own connexion to the place, like theirs, dated to an earlier period.\n\nAs for the \"de Lancinges\" family itself, to whom \"Luke de Ernle\" was kin: they were supporters of the Arundel earls of Sussex who were descended from Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, a major feudal baron who was granted large tracts of Sussex known as the Rape of Arundel in 1067 or 1068 from his kinsman, William I of England.\n\nIt is not now known whether Luke \"de Ernle\" was of Norman, Saxon, or other, origin, these events having occurred a century after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The designation \"de Ernle\" occurs very early in the history of the adoption of hereditary surnames in England, a phenomenon which began along the south-eastern coast of England among the feudal manorial lords (of the greater and lesser nobility) whose members were mostly drawn from the descendants of the Norman invaders and their allies.\n\nThe ancient coat of arms or heraldic shield of the Ernle family was not used pursuant to specific rights described in an extant grant of arms from one of the royal officers of arms, but appears to have been borne by the head of the family through prescriptive right having been adopted in time immemorial. The contents of the shield reflect a knowledge of the name's original meaning, \"resort of eagles\", that is, a place where eagles congregate. As such, the coat could be said to fall into the category of canting arms. The blazon is\n\n\"Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed or\"\n\nwhich means that on a heater shield coloured silver appears a wide sash-like strip of black running diagonally from the top left toward the bottom right of the escutcheon on which is placed a row of three golden eagles with their wings open and bodies showing.\n\nAccording to \"Burke's General Armory\" (1884) and \"Burke's General Armory Two\" (1974), this basic coat of arms, sometimes varying in one detail or another, accompanied by various crests or none, was used over the centuries by the branches of the family, who, by the similarity of their descriptions, claim descent from a shared origin in the same Sussex locality, Earnley, from which they derive their surname.\n\nThese armigerous branches of the family, whose current fate is not always known, with their various differences or departures from the original paternal coat, taken as denoting cadency, were in alphabetical order:\n\n1. Earnley (co. Cornwall). \"Argent, on a bend cotised sable, two (another, three) eagles displayed with two necks or.\"\n\n2. Earnley (co. Kent). \"Argent, a bend sable cotised between three eagles displayed gules.\"\n\n3. Earnley (co. Sussex). \"Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed or.\" Crest: \"A savage's head affrontée, couped at the shoulders, wreathed about the temples, issuing therefrom a plume of three ostrich feathers all proper.\"\n\n4. Erneley (place unspecified). \"Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed of the field.\"\n\n5. Ernelle (co. Kent). \"Argent, on a bend cotised sable, three eagles displayed or.\" Crest: \"A chevalier on horseback wielding a scimitar, all proper.\"\n\n6. Ernelle (place unspecified). \"Argent, a bend sable.\"\n\n7. Ernle (Ernle [i.e. Earnley, co. Sussex, and Whetham, co. Wilts.; descended from RICHARD ERNLE, of Ernle (that is, Earnley, Sussex), temp. Hen. III, the ancestor of Sir John ERNLE, Knt., of Ernle, Chief Justice, K.B., whose descendant*, Sir John Ernle, Knt., of Whetham, co. Wilts., was Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Privy Councillor, temp. Charles II and James II. The family name, EARNLEY, or ERNLE, is derived from a village in Sussex, so called from the Saxon words \"Earn\" and \"Lege,\" the place or habitation of eagles, and, in allusion, the eagles are borne in the arms). \"Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed or.\" Crest -- \"An eagle displayed vert.\". Another crest -- \"A man's head sidefaced, couped at the shoulders proper, on the head a long cap, barry of six or and sable, at the end two strings and tasselled gold.\"\n\n\"*\" This filiation conflicts with what appears in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, which points out the confusion of centuries of genealogists over the two Ernle brothers both, according to a common mediaeval usage unfamiliar to many modern researchers, named John. The elder of these brothers was John Ernle, Esq., of Fosbury and Bishop's Cannings, Wilts., esquire. He was the progenitor of the Wiltshire line, and thus the 17th century Chancellor's direct ancestor, while the younger of them, known to history chiefly as Sir John Ernley, was the Lord Chief Justice. This latter personage was, moreover, not as the post-nominal letters \"K.B.\" denote, a Knight of the original Order of the Bath, but rather a simple knight, formerly called a \"banneret\", or knight of the field, or what would now be termed a Knight Bachelor, or, in casual usage, a \"carpet knight\".\n\n8.

(an abbreviation denoting William Dugdale's work, \"Origines Juridiciales\", London, 1671).\n\nIt is of interest to heraldists also to note that apparently no motto accompanied any of these coats-of-arms.\n\nAs an armorial family whose original status derives from ancient landed property, the Ernle family belonged to the class known as the gentry. As gentlemen with a coat-of-arms, or armigers, the heads of the family were hereditary esquires, and the younger sons and their cadets all gentlemen, and their daughters all gentlewomen. The family were thus all of \"gentle birth\", and were classed as members of what has been termed the \"minor\" or \"lesser nobility\", corresponding to what the Germans term, \"Uradel\", which the French call \"noblesse de race\", or ancient nobility.\n\nThough they never achieved the ranks of the \"greater nobility\" which, in England, was confined to members of the peerage, at least one branch of the family did accede to the ranks of hereditary knighthood, created by King James I of England, and known as the baronetage. In the 20th century, a female-line descendant, Rowland Prothero, was granted an hereditary peerage as Lord Ernle, though that title only existed from 1919 to 1937, due to the early death, in action, during World War I, of his only son, who would have been heir to the peerage, had he outlived the hostilities.\n\nAs can be seen in the case of the cadet lines of its male descendants, junior members of the family sometimes ceased to live as gentry. In England, as opposed to the Continent, where one observes that the legal penalty for dérogeance resulted in the legal loss of nobiliary status due to the failure of someone of gentle or noble blood to live as a noble, this, however, led to no automatic legal denial of their ancient gentility of blood. So, even if living in reduced circumstances, and performing manual labour, such English gentlefolk did not suffer from any deprivation, withdrawal, or removal of their hereditary gentle status. It is possible, however, that some sank so far from their gentle origins and the former lifestyles of their ancestors that all memory of their family's former rank, privileges, precedence, and armigerous status was lost. On the other hand, while no one could deny their abiding gentle status, they might be subject to popular derision if they asserted it without the means of living up to it by the 'port (i.e. deportment), manner, or reputation' of a gentleman.\n\nBy the time this decline began to be observed among the junior-most cadet branches of the family, both the senior male line of the family and their surviving next principal male cadet branch in Wiltshire (see \"Ernle of Brembridge\") had died out (in the late 18th century - in fact, within a year of one another). It is not known if anyone is now entitled to claim a male-line descent from this ancient noble family, and thereby lay claim to use the undifferenced coat-of-arms borne by the head of the Ernle family since time immemorial. The undifferenced arms are, however, quartered in the armorial bearings of the extant Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax family.\n\nThis family derived from \"Luke de Ernle\" who was confirmed in his \"de Lancinges\" nephew's earlier grant to him of almost a quarter of a knight's fee by his \"de Lancinges\" great-niece in 1166.\n\nHistorians' attempts to trace this family over later centuries have met with only partial success, though the continuity of the descent of the manor of Earnley among people bearing that early surname is thought to indicate that successive manorial lords all belonged to the same family.\n\nThe evidence recited in the published account of the manor of Earnley cites a later lord of the manor living around 1260 whose name was also \"Luke de Ernle\" (in this instance, the documentary spelling is \"de Ernele\", and that account favours this spelling of the name). Next, \"John de Ernle son of Luke\" held the manor in 1284. A man who may be this John or his younger son, John, \nreceived a grant of free warren at Earnley in 1318.\n\nIn 1337, mention is made of \"John and Richard de Ernele\", and of \"Joan daughter of John de Ernele\" in connexion with the recovery of the nearby manor of Almodington by \"Robert de Almodington\".\n\nThe next two citations from the 1340s probably pertain to one or other of the two men called \"John de Ernele\" mentioned in 1337.\n\nAccording to the \"Sussex Archaeological Collections\" (1865, p. 248):\n\n\"John de Ernele (Ernley), one of the Coroners for Sussex in 1343, being found inefficient, another was ordered to be elected by the County in his place. (Rot. Cl. 17th Edward III.)\"\n\nA fine dated 1347 names \"John de Ernele of La Manwode\". The place referred to here can be either the name of the hundred in which the parish of Earnley was situate, or an actual locality within the parish of Earnley which happens to have given its name to the hundred, probably because it was the usual meeting-place for the whole hundred when it gathered to conduct business.\n\nThereafter, almost a century elapses before there is a mention of \"John Ernle\" conveying the manor of Earnley to John Michelgrove and his wife, Joan, in 1427. In 1428, 1431 and 1432, however, \"William Ernele\" held the manor.\n\nA generation later, in 1467, there is record of the manor being settled on \"John Lunsford and Margaret his wife\", who was the \"widow of John Ernele\". The descent hereafter is paralleled by the account of the family cited in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" to be found under the heading, \"Sir John Ernley, Chief Justice.\"\n\nAt this juncture, in her proof of coming of age, Elizabeth Michelgrove, wife of John Shelley (both direct ancestors of the poet, Shelley), it is stated that she was baptised at Earnley parish church on 28 March in the 39th year of the reign of King Henry VI of England, that is 1461, and that her godfather was \"John Ernle\" and her godmother, \"Joan Ernle\" (see \"Inq. 15 Ed. VI, no. 66\"), her kinsfolk as the Dictionary of National Biography, under the entry for her son, Sir William Shelley, asserts.\n\nElizabeth was the sole child and heir of her father \"John Michelgrove alias Fauconer\", Esq., of Michelgrove, parish of Clapham, Sussex, and his wife, Agnes or Ann, sometimes called Mary, daughter of William Sydney, of Penshurst, Kent. It would appear from her pedigree that the connexion was probably through the parties mentioned in the 1427 manorial transfer, and that there may have been a blood tie between the \"Michelgrove alias Fauconer\" family and that of \"Ernle\", in addition to the one of spiritual kinship deriving from the Michelgrove heiress's baptism.\n\n\"John Ernele, Ernle, or Ernley\", Solicitor General, then Attorney General of England and, finally, Chief Justice, is mentioned in 1480 as passing the manor to others of his kinsmen, \"John Clerkson, the elder\", and \"John Inglere\", who were great-grandsons of his own forebear, an earlier \"John Ernele\". This is a curious reference as this particular \"John Ernley\" was born in 1464 or 1465, and so was not of age to make a conveyance. Moreover, he had an elder brother, also called John, whom historians refer to as \"John Ernle, The Elder, Esq., of Fosbury and Bishop's Cannings, Wilts.\", to distinguish him from his younger brother of the same name. This elder brother John would normally have been the heir to their father, \"John Ernle, Esq., of Sidlesham, Sussex\" who died in 1465.\n\nThereafter, whoever the \"John Ernle\" of the 1480 conveyance may have been, the manor passed to people of other names who may or may not be connected by blood or marriage to the Ernle family of Earnley. In 1564, the manor was once again conveyed to \"Richard Ernle\" (\"Erneley\" in the documentation in this case), indicating that it may, for a time, have been held in trust for the right Ernle heir, and then returned at an appropriate date. At any rate, the connexion between the descent of the manor of \"Earnley\" and the family of the name \"Ernle\" ended finally when a later \"Richard Erneley\" sold it to Richard Taylor in 1630. Thereafter, the family of Ernle, as distinct from the manor of the same name, became attached to the episcopal manor of Cackham in West Wittering, a place close to their original home at Earnley in West Sussex.\n\nDespite their proximity to their ancestral lands, the Sussex branch of the Ernle family's close ties with the manor and parish from which they derived their surname, seem, however, to have been severed finally in the first third of the 17th century, after the space of nearly 500 years of continuous manorial tenure.\n\nEvidence of the eclipse of the Sussex branch of the Ernle family by their Wiltshire kinsmen is seen in the lifetime of the immediate heir of the Sussex line's most successful member:\n\n\"\"In Sussex, William Earnley was the son of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; in contrast to most of his colleagues, who had at least £40 a year with an average of £100, he had only £26 produced by a medley of very small properties, in addition to which he leased Cakeham manor from the Bishop of Chichester.\"\"\n\nOne of the latest references to a member of this branch playing a prominent role in the affairs of the county dates from December 1624:\n\n\"Justices warrant to apoynte a Provost Marshall and to sett Watch & Ward December 1624\"\n\n\"After our very harty comendacons : Whereas we have lately receaved Letters from the Lords of his Ma[jesty's] most hon[ourable] Privy Councell directed to us the Justices of Peace of this County; wherein theire Lo[rdships] require for the better secureinge of high wayes and the more safety of places wh. about this season of the yeare are usually offended by idle and loose p'sons and at this tyme is more to be suspected than at other tymes in respect of the great leavyes of Souldiers lately made and to be made who are to be conducted through this County that there should be provost Marshalls stirringe and therefore we have thoughte good to apoynte you\"\n\nMr Earnely of Cr.

By the time of the 1634 heraldic Visitation of Sussex, the remaining Sussex Ernle heritage was represented by \"Bridget, da. of Richard Ernley and wife of Richard Stanney\".\n\nReference to the records of the Archbishop of Canterbury's testamentary jurisdiction provides the final evidences of the extinction of the Sussex line:\n\n\"Abstracts of Probate Acts in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, volume 1, 1630-34\", p. 146\n\n\"Anno 1632\"\n\"ERNLE, Richard, of Cackham (Cakeham, p. West Wittering), Sussex, Esq.\nWill [66 Audley] pr. June 16 by rel. Susan. P.r. ELIZ. RISHTON\"\n\n\"Abstracts of Probate Acts in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, Supplement. Sentences and complete index nominum, 1630-1639\", p. 32\n\n\"ERNLE, Richard, of Cackham, Sussex, Esq.\"\n\"Extrix. v. sister BRIDGET STANNY\"\n\"Sent. pro. val. test., June 16, 1632 [66 Audley]\n\"Will [66 Audley] pr[oved] same date.\"\n\nThus we see why the 1634 Sussex Visitation showed Bridget Stanney as the representative of the Ernle family in Sussex, for her brother had died sometime before the final disposition of his worldly estate by will and sentence of 16 June 1632.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that, when the 1662 heraldic Visitation of Sussex was made, no further pedigree was recorded for the ancient Sussex family of Ernle, and what Ernle blood remained in the county was inherited via the female line, as in the case of the Stanney or Stanny and Rishton families.\n\nThus was extinguished one of the ancient historic surnames of the county of Sussex. The Sussex Ernle family might have deserved some place in Sir J. Bernard Burke's chronicle of the rise and fall from prominence of old names, \"The Vicissitudes of Families\", though he chiefly concerned himself with the demise of families comprising the greater nobility of the realm.\n\nThe Ernle family maintained their manorial demesne at Earnley on the Sussex coast for centuries. In the early Tudor period, the original, or Sussex branch, of the Ernle family gave rise to Sir John Ernle (or Ernley), Knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (1519–1520), whose career, begun during the reign of King Henry VII of England reached its height in the reign of his son and successor, King Henry VIII of England. Sir John Ernley's legal and judicial career and family connexions are detailed in the DNB and its successor, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\n\nSir John's descendants remained in Sussex through the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods maintaining their connexion with the manor of Earnley until its sale in 1630, during the first years of the reign of King Charles I. Thereafter, it becomes harder to trace the descent of the Sussex branch of the family, though there are traces of it in Sussex in the 17th and 18th centuries as well as in neighbouring Hampshire.\n\nIn 1538, under Henry VIII, \"William Ernle\", son of Sir John Ernle, Lord Chief Justice, was sent to Chichester cathedral as a royal commissioner along with Sir William Goring to take down the Shrine of St Richard of Chichester located there.\n\nAs Chichester cathedral was the chief church of the diocese where their estates lay, and St Richard was a local saint whose Shrine was decorated by pilgrims and members of the local gentry for over 250 years during the pre-Reformation period, this task was partly a test of the Sussex Ernle family head's loyalty to the new religion, the Church of England, whereof, on earth, the king had declared his royal supremacy supplanting the authority of the pope.\n\nLocal legends at West Wittering in Sussex (a place where the Ernle family also held lands at this time) which claim that the bones of St Richard were hidden in a tomb there give rise to the possibility that this \"William Ernle\" or someone closely associated with him managed to secure the saint's relics for posterity when the removal and destruction of the ornaments and relics of St Richard's Shrine took place partly under Ernle's direction. \"William Ernle\" and Elizabeth his wife's tombs with their partially destroyed inscriptions are considered by historians to lie in West Wittering parish church, so the connexion, if true, was close.\n\nBe that as it may, later generations of Sussex \"Ernle\"s appear to have conformed to the Church of England more enthusiastically. In 1564, \"Mr Richard Ernlie\" (misprinted as \"Crulie\"), of Cackham (now Cakeham), Sussex, son of William, the royal commissioner of 1538, is listed as being one of the gentlemen of Sussex who was designated as being among the \"favourers of godlie procedinges\", indicating that he was by then a staunch, if rather sobre, Anglican, when such a description was a mark of approval from Church and State alike.\n\nIn the 18th century, the senior Wiltshire branch of the \"Ernle\" family claimed that they had established themselves in Wiltshire and abandoned their ancestral lands in Sussex in order to avoid any further exposure to England's seafaring enemies caused by their estate's proximity to the Sussex coast. Examination of their published pedigree reveals that, in fact, the two branches of the family, seated in Sussex and Wiltshire, existed simultaneously for over a century.\n\nBy the 17th century, however, the name \"Ernle\" seems virtually to have disappeared from Sussex, while the branch established in Wiltshire by \"John Ernle, The Elder, Esq., of Fosbury, Wiltshire and Bishop's Cannings, Wiltshire\" (born 1464/5), elder brother of Sir John Ernle, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (1519–1520), or his ancestors, continued to flourish in its new home.\n\nRecorded in the Visitation of Wiltshire in 1565, and, again, in 1623, the main seat of the family in Wiltshire was at Bourton manorhouse, said to be a former priory in the parish of Bishop's Cannings, but the initial connexion of the family with Wiltshire seems to have stemmed not from this estate but from the marriage in the first third of the 15th century of a Sussex \"Ernle\" to the heiress of an old Wiltshire manorial family, \"Malwyn (or Malwain) of Etchilhampton (alias Ashlington)\".\n\nIn contrast, the following account given by Archdeacon Macdonald in the \"Wiltshire Archæological and Natural History Society Magazine\" (1860) reflects the traditional view of how the connexion of the \"Ernle\" family was forged with Wiltshire:\n\n\"\"Tything of Bourton and Easton (Consolidated).\"\"\n\n\"\"Bourton was one of the seats of the ancient family of Ernle, who came into possession of this property in the time of Henry VIII; John son of William de Ernle having purchased the estate on the dissolution of the monasteries; the land being said to have been Priory property, but for this we have only vague traditional authority, no account of any religious house there, being to be found in any of the best works on the subject. The Ernle property at Echilhampton [Etchilhampton] belonged to the ancient family of Malwyn, came into the Ernle family with Joan Best wife of John Ernle...\"\"\n\nThis tradition needs to be examined carefully, for it contains two sections that require separation so that its true significance is understood.\n\nFirst, the acquisition of the lands at Bourton could not have occurred in the lifetime of \"William de Ernle's\" son \"John Ernle\" because he died in 1417 according to a Sussex inquisition post mortem. The period of monastic dissolution occurred over a century later in the period 1538 to 1541. As an aside, this may also be the reason why no one has been able to find a record of the sale of Bourton as a monastic property in the latter period.\n\nSecondly, a better idea of when the \"Ernle\" link with Wiltshire was forged can, however, be gleaned from the latter half of the foregoing account. The aforementioned heiress of the \"Malwyn\" family, \"Joan Best\" (daughter of \"Simon Best\" and his wife \"Agnes, daughter of John Malwyn or Malwain, Esq., lord of the manor of Etchilhampton\") must have married \"John Ernle of Sussex\", not later than about 1430, for their son, another \"John Ernle\" (of Sidlesham and Earnley, Sussex), was already a father of young sons himself, when he died in 1465, naming his mother Joan (born circa 1410 to 1415) and wife, Margaret (née Morley, of Glynde Place, Sussex) in his will dated that year.\n\nThe \"Ernle\" family, however, did not inherit Etchilhampton until several intervening heirs of the Malwain's property had first occupied it and then died themselves before \"Joan Best's\" senior heir, her grandson, \"John Ernle of Fosbury, Wiltshire\", finally gained possession of the estate many years after his grandmother's death.\n\nBefore their eventual inheritance of these lands in Wiltshire, it is not surprising then that the Ernle family concentrated their activities on Sussex, while maintaining a presence in both counties.\n\nChristopher Whittick's DNB account of \"Sir John Ernley's\" career has this to say about \"Ernle\" family two-county history:\n\n\"The family had been lords of the manor of Earnley near Chichester since the 13th century\" [sic, properly since the 12th]...\"the acquisition by marriage of lands and a parliamentary seat in Wiltshire in the 1430s, and legal preferment in Sussex after the Yorkist victory in 1460...\"\n\nculminated, in terms of the early modern period, in the career of the \"Lord Chief Justice Ernle\" under the first two Tudor monarchs.\n\nSupportive of these statements is the following evidence that the head of the Sussex family of Ernle, William Ernle, esq., of Earnley, is named both in Sussex and in Wiltshire as holding lands by the same source, which shows him as having interests in both counties in the same year, viz.:\n\n\"Inquisitions and assessments relating to feudal aids: with other analogous documents preserved in the Public Record Office, A. D. 1284-1431\", vol. 5\n\np. 155\n\n\"A.D. 1428\" [page heading] [section covering the county of Sussex] \n\"Rapus Cicestrie\" \n\"Hundredum de Manewode\" \n\"WILLELMUS de ERNLE tenet iiijtam partem j.f. in ERNLE quondam JOHANNIS ERNLE, subsidium xx.d.\"\n\n[translated from Latin to English as]\n\n\"The Rape of Cicestrie\" [i.e. Chichester] \n\"The Hundred of Manwode\" [i.e. Manwood, now Manhood]\n\n\"WILLIAM de ERNLE holds the fourth part of j.f. in EARNLEY formerly held by John ERNLE, paying a subsidy [i.e. a tax] of 20 pence\"\n\np. 164\n\n\"Inquisicio capta apud Arundell die Lune proximo post festum Sancti Dunstani anno etc. (as before [i.e. 1428, on p. 163, where the section starts] ) de parochiis infra decanatus de Boxgrave, Midherst, Arundell et Storgheton in quibus decem persone inhabitantes domicilia tenentes existunt per sacramenta WILLELMI ERNLE, Johannis Wystryng, Thome Cotes, Thome Stedham, Willelmi atte Tye, Johannis Strode, Willelmi Preston, Roberti Palmer, Ricardi Danell, Johannis Michelgrove, Johannis Goringe, et Willelmi Merew, qui vero jurati dicunt super sacramentum quod:-\"\n\n\"Sunt in parochiis supscriptis ut sequitur:-\"\n\n[Englished from Latin]\n\n\"Inquisition taken at Arundell on the Monday next after the feast of St Dunstan in the year etc. (1428) concerning the parishes listed as falling under the jurisdiction of the deanery of Boxgrave [modern Boxgrove], Midherst [modern Midhurst], Arundell [modern Arundel], and Storgheton in which ten persons inhabiting dwellings exist by the oath of WILLIAM ERNLE, John Wystryng, Thomas Cotes, Thomas Stedham, William atte Tye, John Strode, William Preston, Robert Palmer [likely ERNLE relation], Richard Danell, John Michelgrove [a name associated with the ERNLE family], John Goringe [another name associated with ERNLEs, though more usually found as Goring], and William Merew, who say by true oaths upon the holy sacrament that\"\n\n\"there are in the parishes above written and which follow:-\"\n\n\"BOXGRAVE\" [deanery]\n\n[four parishes intervening]\n\n\"In parochia de ERNLE rector ibidem.

The significance of this connexion between EARNLEY, Sussex and Yatesbury, Wiltshire—while not as obvious as the one with Fosbury, Wiltshire with which John ERNLE, The Elder, was later associated—is not, however, to be glossed over lightly. For, whereas Fosbury, and later Bishop's Cannings in Wiltshire, became the main seat of the ERNLE family; significantly, they also held Yatesbury for centuries, perhaps starting in or before 1428 (and no earlier than 1412 when no ERNLE is recorded in an early subsidy roll for Wiltshire). For example, Francis ERNLE, third son of John ERNLE, of Burton in Bishop's Cannings (d. 1572), was described as gentleman, of Yatesbury in his will, and his children retained the connexion.\n\nIn 1412, however, we see that while the ERNLE family was present as major landholders in Sussex, they had not yet forged their connexion with Wiltshire, viz.:\n\n\"Inquisitions and assessments relating to feudal aids : with other analogous documents preserved in the Public Record Office, A. D. 1284-1431\", vol. 6.\n\np. 520\n\n\"Sussex A.D. 1412\"\n\np. 522 [same county]\n\n\"WILLELMUS ERNELE habet maneria etc. cum pertinenciis, que valent xxi. li. xiij. s. videlicet terras etc. in MANWODE apud ERNELE xx. li., et terras etc. in MENESSE liij. s. iiij. d.

And that these lands etc...\"\n\nAccording to the Wiltshire section of the book, p. 541, Yatesbury was then held by Henricus Thorp, while, John MALWAIN or MALWYN, of Etchilhampton, Wilts., a later ERNLE ancestor (see additional references earlier in this section) appears on p. 540, as:\n\n\"Johannes MALWAYN habet terras etc. qui valent etc. xxv. li., videlicet in ECHELHAMPTON, WODHAMPTON, ERCHESFONTE, et CONOK xx. li. et apud MERTON, c. s.\"\n\n[translated from Latin into English follows]\n\n\"John MALWAYN has lands etc. which are valued etc. at 25 pounds, that is to say, in ECHELHAMPTON, WODHAMPTON, ERCHESFONTE (modern Urchfont, Wilts.), and CONOK (modern Conock in the parish of Chirton), worth 20 pounds, and in and about MERTON, 50 shillings.\" (If not in Wiltshire, this Merton may refer to the one in Surrey, in which case it was probably acquired through the family's known London mercantile interests. The other localities are all in Wiltshire).\n\nThe dual presence of the ERNLE family in Sussex and Wiltshire seems to have been maintained for some generations as is evident from the fact that John ERNLE, The Elder, Esq., of Fosbury, was appointed as one of the four commissioners for Wiltshire in the 13 Hen. VII (1496) parliament, as\n\n\"Johes. ERNLEY\" (along with Christopher Tropnell, \"Cristoforus Tropynell\", John Gawen \"Johes Gawen\", and George Chatterton, \"Georgius Chaderton\"),\n\nwhile some 9 years later, his younger brother, the confusingly-named John ERNLE (later Sir John ERNLE, Knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Commons Pleas), sat as one of the ten Members of Parliament allotted to the county Sussex in the 19th year of Henry VII's reign [1505] as\n\n\"John ERNLY, Gentilman\" [denoting the rank he held as an Esquire's younger son]\n\nfound in the circle of his Sussex kin and neighbours (\"Thomas Fynes\" [Fiennes], \"Knight\"; \"John Coke\" [Cooke], \"Esquyer\"; \"John Goryng\" [Goring], \"Esquyer\"; and \"Roger Leykenour\" [Lewknor] \"of Tangermer\"), and significantly found listed here in the company of the ill-fated \"Edmond Dudley\", \"Esquyer\", recent Speaker of the House of Commons, and leading minister to the king, to whom ERNLE owed so much of his later rise to prominence, while fortunately avoiding the fate of his ill-starred patron. Indeed, after Dudley's execution in 1510, the younger John ERNLE appeared in the rolls of Parliament for 1513 as one of the 15 M.P.s for Sussex (among them a brace of Lewknors, two Fiennes, a Covert, all neighbours and kin), and, notably on the rise, as attorney to an approving master, the King, viz.:\n\n\"Joh'es ERNLEY, Attorn. Regis\" [i.e. John ERNLEY, King's Attorney]\n\nNonetheless, the fortunes of the Sussex branch of the family went into a slow decline under the heirs of Sir John Ernley (died 1520): his son William Ernle, M.P., of Cakeham, Sussex, (died 1545), and grandson Richard Ernle (died 1577). Wiltshire, however, proved to be fertile ground for the expansion of the family over successive generations.\n\nJohn Ernle of Fosbury (fl. 1507) had three sons: John his heir (died 1556), Anthony, of Laverstoke, Wilts. (died 1530), and William, a Fellow of New College, Oxford, and later parish priest of Yatesbury, Wilts.\n\nJohn Ernle (died 1556), in turn, had a son and heir John Ernle (died 1572) and William Ernle, founder of the Dorset branch of the family.\n\nJohn Ernle (died 1572), married Mary, daughter of William Hyde, Esq., of Denchworth, Berkshire, and had three sons: Michael his heir (d. 1593/4); Thomas (died 1595), of Brembridge manor, Dilton, Westbury, Wilts., and Francis, of Yatesbury, Wilts. John and Mary also had one daughter, Anne, who married Robert Partridge (or Partrydge) (d. 1600), of Wishanger manor, Miserden, Gloucestershire, in about 1566.\nThe proliferation of cadet branches in Wiltshire, however, arose chiefly from the two marriages of Michael Ernle (died 1593/4), first to the heiress of the Whetham House estate, Mary Finnemore, and, secondly, to Susan Hungerford, the daughter of Sir Walter Hungerford by his second wife, Anne Dormer. From these two marriages, there were ten children giving rise to a number of cadet branches of the family seated throughout the county. The chief (senior-most) of these lived at Whetham House in the parish of Calne, Wiltshire. There were also branches at Conock, parish of Chirton, Wiltshire, All Cannings, Wiltshire, Etchilhampton alias Ashlington, Wiltshire, Brimslade Park, parish of Brimslade, Wiltshire, and Burytown, Bury Blunsdon, parish of Highworth, Wiltshire.\n\nOf these, the most prominent was the branch descended from Edward Ernle, son of Michael Ernle, Esq., of Bourton (died 1595), by his second wife, Susan Hungerford, daughter of Sir Walter Hungerford, Kt, of Farley Castle, Somerset, a granddaughter of the executed Walter, Lord Hungerford. Baptised at Calne in 1587, Edward Ernle, and his wife Gertrude St Lowe, were progenitors of the Ernle Baronets of Etchilhampton, alias Ashlington, Wiltshire, and the 'self-styled' Ernle baronets of Brimslade Park. It was their son, Sir Walter Ernle, Knight, of Etchilhampton, who was created a baronet shortly after the Restoration by King Charles II on 2 February 1660/1, as Sir Walter Ernle, 1st Baronet. Passing first through his own heirs, the baronetcy was used, with doubtful authority, according to \"The Complete Baronetage\", by the Brimslade Park branch of the family established by his younger brother, Michael Ernle, gent., of Brimslade. That line, too, died out, and the \"soi-disant\" baronet's dignities, real or imagined, were finally extinguished with the death in 1787 of the Reverend Sir Edward Ernle, 7th Baronet, the Anglican rector of Avington, Berkshire, without issue, at the age of 75.\n\nIn addition, cadet branches stemming from Michael Ernle's forebears include those derived from his father John Ernle's second son, Thomas Ernle, gent., of Brembridge manor, Dilton, Westbury, Wiltshire (died 1595), and his third and youngest son, Francis Ernle, gent., of Yatesbury, Wiltshire. Earlier still, a cadet line derived from Michael Ernle's uncle, William Ernle, had established itself at Sutton Benger, Wiltshire, and later at Chalbury in Dorset.\n\nThis line was established by Thomas Ernle (I), gent. (died 1595), second of the three sons, with one daughter, of John Ernle, Esq., of Bourton Priory, Bishop's Cannings, Wiltshire, by his wife, Mary, daughter of William Hyde, Esq., of Denchworth, Berkshire.\n\nThe Brembridge or Bremeridge manor branch of the family proliferated through the fourteen children - no fewer than ten sons and four daughters - of Thomas Ernle (died 1595) and his wife Bridget (died 1610), daughter of Richard Franklin, of Overton, Wilts.\n\nThe eldest son, Thomas Ernle (II), gent. (died 1639), married Praxed or Praxeda Lambe, a daughter of John Lambe (d.v.p. 1615), a son of the lord of the manor of Coulston, Wiltshire. Thomas (II) became lessee of the manor of Abingdon Court, Cricklade St Sampson, Wiltshire, in succession to his father, and held the advowson of St Sampson's parish church, Cricklade.\n\nFrom him was descended the Ernle family of Braydon and Purton, Wiltshire, continued by Thomas (II)'s son, Thomas (III), gent., of Braydon, Purton (1614–1694), and his wife, Jane, daughter of the Antwerp-born naturalised London merchant, Philip Jacobson, gent., King's Jeweller, to James I of England and Charles I of England, and fee-farmer of estates in Braydon Forest, Wiltshire.\n\nOther sons of the line's founder established themselves elsewhere: Edward Ernle, gent., (1577–1655) at Bath, Somerset; Francis Ernle, gent. (born 1577) in the parish of St John Zachary in London; William Ernle, gent. (1583–1663) at Bideford in Devon.\n\nThe line at Bremeridge itself was continued by Richard Ernle, gent. (1584–1650), seventh son of the original Thomas Ernle (I) (died 1595). He married Elizabeth Cogswell, a member of the wealthy family of clothiers in Westbury parish, Wiltshire, and their line continued until the last scion of that family, another Richard Ernle, was buried at Old Dilton chapelry, Westbury, Wiltshire, in 1786, aged 84.\n\nToday the surname \"Ernle\" only survives as an inheritance via the female line, employed by the \"Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax\" family of Charborough House, Dorset, whose head is the Westminster M.P., Richard Drax, otherwise Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, Esq., but there are few mentions of the \"Ernle\" women over the centuries.\n\nMost \"Ernle\" daughters made suitable marital alliances with members of other gentry families, but it can still be difficult to trace their posterity beyond the first or second generation. Often all that is known of an \"Ernle\" wife is her name, her father's name, and his rank and the name of the place where he had his estate or resided. One slight exception is noteworthy simply due to the paucity of other material. It comes from an epitaph and extols the chief adornment that any lady of good family in times past could bring to her husband besides a dowry of money and land: physical beauty. The quotation comes from John Aubrey's \"Collections for Wiltshire\", under the section on the parish of Calne:\n\n\"Here under liethe the body of Lady Frances Mildmay, wife to Sir Thomas Mildmay. She dyed in the faith of Christ the ninth of December, 1624. She was daughter to Sir Jno. Ernle of Whetham, and was a very rare beauty.\"\n\nThe senior line at Whetham House, Calne, Wiltshire, gave rise to the Right Honourable Sir John Ernle (1620–1697), Knight, P.C., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer to kings Charles II and James II from 1676 to 1689, whose biography is given in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\".\n\nAnother member of the Whetham line, Sir Michael Ernle (1599-?1645), Knight, uncle to the Chancellor, was a royalist commander during the English Civil War. His end is unclear, as John Aubrey's \"Natural History of Wiltshire\", points out:\n\n<poem>Sir Michael Ernele, Knight, was second son of Sir John Ernele, of Whetham in the County of Wilts. After he had spent some time at the University of Oxford, he betooke himself to a militarie life in the Low Countries, where he became so good a proficient that at his return into England at the beginning of the Civill warres, King Charles the First gave him the commission of a Colonell in his service, and shortly after he was made Governour of Shrewsbury, and he was, or intended to bee, Major Generall. He did his Majesty good service in the warres, as doth appeare by the Mercurii Aulici. His garrison at Shrewsbury being weakened by drawing out great part of them before the battle at Marston Moore, the townesmen plotted and betrayed his garrison to the Parliament soldiers. He was slain then in the market-place, about the time of the battle of Marston Moore.*\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> [It was the common belief that Sir Michael Erneley was killed, as here stated, by the Parliamentary soldiers at the time Shrewsbury was taken (Feb. 3, 1644–5); but in Owen and Blakeway's Hist, of Shrewsbury, 4to. 1825, the time and manner of his death is left uncertain. His name is included in the list of those who were made prisoners when the town surrendered.—J. B.]</poem>\n\nSir John Ernle, R.N. (1647–1686), Knight, of Burytown, Bury Blunsdon (otherwise Broad Blunsdon in Highworth parish), Wiltshire, eldest son of the foregoing Chancellor of the Exchequer, was an English naval officer during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, notably commanding H.M.S. \"Dover\" at the Battle of Solebay at the start of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672. He is also mentioned in John Aubrey's \"Natural History of Wiltshire\"\n\nSir John Ernele, great-grandson of Sir John Ernele above sayd, and eldest son of Sir John Ernele, late Chancellour of the Exchequer, had the command of a flagship, and was eminent in some sea services. He married the daughter and heir of Sir John Kerle [modern, Kyrle] of ... [Much Marcle] in Herefordshire.\n\nHis son, John Kyrle Ernle, Esq. (1683–1725), of Whetham, Calne, Wiltshire, and Much Marcle, Herefordshire, entertained Queen Anne at Whetham.\n\nWilliam Ernle (1583–1663), gent., sixth of the tens sons, with four daughters, of Thomas Ernle, gent., of Bremeridge manor, Dilton, Wiltshire, and his wife, Bridget, daughter of Richard Franklin, established himself as a merchant at Bideford, Devon. He married Philippa, a daughter of Edmund Tremayne, by his wife, Elizabeth St Ledger. He is mentioned in a work on the Bideford Witch trial, one of the last such events in England. In that text, the connexion to the Ernle at Newburgh Park, Coxwold, Yorkshire, is established from contemporary documents.\n\nIn the 17th century, a cadet branch of the Wiltshire-based family also established itself in Dorset, a county to the south-west of Wiltshire, where it was recorded in the \"Visitation of Dorset\" of 1623. Seated first at Sutton Benger, Wiltshire, it later became associated with Chalbury in Dorset. The published registers of the University of Oxford, Foster's \"Alumni Oxonienses\" show that members of the family persisted there, and elsewhere in Dorset, until well into the 18th century.\n\n\"The Life of Marmaduke Rawdon\" notes that in the 17th century, one John Ernle (here recorded as \"Mr. John Earneley\") was \"chiefe gentleman\" in the service of Lord Falconbridge (modern Fauconberg), whose seat was at Newburgh Park, near Coxwold, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. At that period, members of the lesser gentry often served the greater gentlefolk, which is to say, the nobility, a practice which gave rise to the expression, a \"gentleman's gentleman\". Information about \"Ernle of Bideford, Devon\" shows that this Yorkshire gentleman belonged to the family of \"Ernle of Brembridge\". In 1670, Mary, one of the daughters of \"John Earnley of Alne, gent.\" [Yorkshire] accused Anne Wilkinson, widow, of having used witchcraft against her and two of her sisters, allegedly causing the death of her sister, Eleanor. This anecdote serves to show the links not only between the Ernle family in Devon and Yorkshire, but also to demonstrate the shadow cast in both counties by the witchcraft hysteria then so prevalent.\n\nLXXIX. Anne Wilkinson. York, Apr. 1, 1670. — Before Fr[ancis]. Driffield, Esq. Anne Mattson saith, that yesterday, Mary Earneley, daughter of Mr. John Earnley of Alne, fell into a very sicke fitt, in which shee continued a long time,\" \"sometimes cryinge out that Wilkinson wyfe prickt her with pins, clappinge her hands upon her thighs, intimatinge, as this informant thinketh, that she pricked her thighes. And other times shee cryed out, \"That is shee,\" and said Wilkinson's wyfe run a spitt into her. Whereupon Mr. Earnley sent for Anne Wilkinson, widdow; and, when as the said Wilkinson came into the parlour where the said Mary Earnley lay, the said Mary Earnley shooted out and cryed, \" Burne her, burne her, shee tormented two of my sisters.\" Shee saith further that two sisters of the said Mary Earnleye's dyed since Candlemasse last, and one of them upon the 19th of March last dyed, and, a little before her death, there was taken out of her mouth a blacke ribbond with a crooked pinne at the end of it. George Wrightson of Alne saith, that yesterday, Mary, dau. of John Earnley, gent., fell into a violent and sicke fitt and continued therein one houre and more, all that time crying out in a most sad and lamentable manner that Anne Wilkinson was cruelly prickinge and tormentinge her with pins, as the said Anne was sittinge by her owne fire upon a little chaire; and presently Mrs. Earnley sent this informant to the said Anne Wilkinson's house, whoe brought word shee was there sittinge by the fire upon a little chaire when he suddenly came into her house. Anne Wilkinson of Alne, widdow, saith that she never did Mr. Earnley, nor any that belonged to him, any harme, nor would shee doe; and, as for bewitchinge any of his children, she was sacklesse. Margaret, wife of Richard Wilson, sayth, that in her former husband John Akers' lifetime, she once lost out of her purse 50s. all but three halfe pence; and, shortly after, there happened to be a great wind, and after the wind was downe, she, this ex[aminan]t, mett with Anne Wilkinson, who fell into a great rage, bitterly cursing this ex[aminan]t., and telling her that she had been att a wise man, and had raised this wind which had put out her eyes, and that she was stout now she had gott her money againe, and wishing she might never thrive, which cursing of the said Anne did soe trouble this ex[aminan]t. that she fell a weeping, and, coming home told her mother what had happened, and her mother bad her put her trust in God, and she hoped she could doe her noe harme. And the next day she churned but could gitt noe butter; and, presently, after this ex[aminan]t. fell sicke, and so continued for neere upon two yeeres, till a Scotch phytsitian came to Tollerton, to whom this ex[aminan]t. went, and the phisitiane told her she had harme done her. And she further sayth that her said husband, John Acres, fell shortly after ill, and dy'd of a lingering disease, but, till then, he was very strong and healthfull.\n\nThe surname has many variants, including \"Erneley\", \"Ernley\", \"Earnely\", \"Earneley\" and \"Ernly\". Though apparently extinct in the male line in the United Kingdom, its current use as an ancient English surname has been actively maintained by its inclusion as the second component of the quadruple-barrelled patronymic, Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax (see double-barrelled surname), borne by descendants of John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany, whose wife was Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Ernle-Erle-Drax, née Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (1855–1916), who was doubly descended, both in the female line, from members of the Wiltshire Ernle family.\n\nAs demonstrated in the foregoing passage, the name Ernle, Ernley (also Ernlé, Ernlè, Ernly, and Ernleigh) is also employed by descendants of the family and others as a given name. Examples include Ernle Bradford (1922–1986), the writer, and Alfred Ernle Montacute Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield, PC (1873–1967), and his son Ernle David Lewis Chatfield, 2nd Baron Chatfield (born 1917), (see also Baron Chatfield), and Sir Ernley Blackwell, KCB, legal assistant under-secretary of State at the Home Office (1906–1931). The British Conservative politician and writer Ernle Money was given the name at birth in 1931.\n\nAdditionally, it was also used as the name for the barony granted to Rowland Edmund Prothero (1851–1937), who was created the 1st Baron Ernle, on 4 February 1919, for whose career and family history consult L.G. Pine's New Extinct Peerage.\n\n\n"}

The population is 140.\n\nGreek geographer Strabo mentions a settlement named Aloip, which was inhabited by the Liburnians. During the Roman rule, Aloip was rebuilt in a different location, in the island's south-west.\n\nCroats colonized the island from mid-7th to late 8th century. Another wave of Croatian inhabitants arrived in the mid to late 15th century, from Vrlika in the Cetinska Krajina, fleeing the Ottoman invasions. The Chakavian dialect of the Croatian language is spoken on Olib and residents call themselves Olibjani.\n\nThe island has many historic buildings and ruins. Among these are the Parish Church Assumption of Mary with its collection of antiquities including Glagolitic codices dating back to the 17th century (housed in the treasury of the parish rectory), the stone Tower or \"Kula\" built for protection from pirates, and the ruins of St. Paul's Church and Monastery which was abandoned in the 13th century.\n\nThe traditional products of Olib include wine, olive oil, and cheese. Most of the food is consumed locally rather than being sold in the market.\n\nOlib has no native freshwater sources. Consequently, nearly all homes on the island are built with cisterns to capture rainwater. There are also two communal wells available to residents. During the summer months, the island receives an additional supply of water carried by ships.\n\nAlthough the year-round population only hovers around 100, that number swells during the summer months when both descendants of the island's native population as well as international tourists come to enjoy the ample sea, sun, and relaxed atmosphere.\n\nOlib is connected to the mainland by ferry to Zadar via the islands of Silba and Premuda. The journey to the mainland takes approximately two hours on a catamaran or three to five hours on a car ferry. Cars are forbidden to be used for transport on the island, instead having to be parked in a designated area adjacent to the harbor.\n"}

While a mullet is short in the front and long in the back, the opposite is true for a tellum. The hair is longer in the front (usually straight cheek-chin length hair), and is short/buzzed in the back. The back is often spiky as well. It is not uncommon that the back layers of hair are dyed a different color than the front, or that there are drastically different colored streaks (highlights/lowlights) running through the front of the hair.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the first interpretation of the tellum was the devilock, made famous by The Misfits. The Misfits style has the devilock centered on the eyes and gelled in place.\n\nIn the late 1980s this style of hair was very popular among emo subculture, which later transformed into the \"emo hairstyle\". Thus, the tellum is often associated with the \"emo style\" and is frequently, but not always, worn by those who could be considered “emo”.\n\nIn the early 1990s Edward Furlong's hairstyle in \"\" gave rise to a new wave of tellums worn by teenagers.\n\nIn 2007 when Kate Gosselin emerged into the reality television world, she and her tellum, which resembles a bob hairstyle in the front and is cropped short in the back, quickly became a favorite among fans of the popular reality series, \"Jon and Kate Plus 8\".

{"id": "2216927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216927", "title": "Cube mapping", "text": "Cube mapping\n\nIn computer graphics, cube mapping is a method of environment mapping that uses the six faces of a cube as the map shape. The environment is projected onto the sides of a cube and stored as six square textures, or unfolded into six regions of a single texture. The cube map is generated by first rendering the scene six times from a viewpoint, with the views defined by a 90 degree view frustum representing each cube face.\n\nIn the majority of cases, cube mapping is preferred over the older method of sphere mapping because it eliminates many of the problems that are inherent in sphere mapping such as image distortion, viewpoint dependency, and computational inefficiency. Also, cube mapping provides a much larger capacity to support real-time rendering of reflections relative to sphere mapping because the combination of inefficiency and viewpoint dependency severely limits the ability of sphere mapping to be applied when there is a consistently changing viewpoint.\n\nCube mapping was first proposed in 1986 by Ned Greene in his paper “Environment Mapping and Other Applications of World Projections”, ten years after environment mapping was first put forward by Jim Blinn and Martin Newell. However, hardware limitations on the ability to access six texture images simultaneously made it infeasible to implement cube mapping without further technological developments. This problem was remedied in 1999 with the release of the Nvidia GeForce 256. Nvidia touted cube mapping in hardware as “a breakthrough image quality feature of GeForce 256 that ... will allow developers to create accurate, real-time reflections. Accelerated in hardware, cube environment mapping will free up the creativity of developers to use reflections and specular lighting effects to create interesting, immersive environments.” Today, cube mapping is still used in a variety of graphical applications as a favored method of environment mapping.\n\nCube mapping is preferred over other methods of environment mapping because of its relative simplicity. Also, cube mapping produces results that are similar to those obtained by ray tracing, but is much more computationally efficient – the moderate reduction in quality is compensated for by large gains in efficiency.\n\nPredating cube mapping, sphere mapping has many inherent flaws that made it impractical for most applications. Sphere mapping is view dependent meaning that a different texture is necessary for each viewpoint. Therefore, in applications where the viewpoint is mobile, it would be necessary to dynamically generate a new sphere mapping for each new viewpoint (or, to pre-generate a mapping for every viewpoint). Also, a texture mapped onto a sphere's surface must be stretched and compressed, and warping and distortion (particularly along the edge of the sphere) are a direct consequence of this. Although these image flaws can be reduced using certain tricks and techniques like “pre-stretching”, this just adds another layer of complexity to sphere mapping.\n\nParaboloid mapping provides some improvement on the limitations of sphere mapping, however it requires two rendering passes in addition to special image warping operations and more involved computation.\n\nConversely, cube mapping requires only a single render pass, and due to its simple nature, is very easy for developers to comprehend and generate. Also, cube mapping uses the entire resolution of the texture image, compared to sphere and paraboloid mappings, which also allows it to use lower resolution images to achieve the same quality. Although handling the seams of the cube map is a problem, algorithms have been developed to handle seam behavior and result in a seamless reflection.\n\nIf a new object or new lighting is introduced into scene or if some object that is reflected in it is moving or changing in some manner, then the reflection changes and the cube map must be re-rendered. When the cube map is affixed to an object that moves through the scene then the cube map must also be re-rendered from that new position.\n\nComputer-aided design (CAD) programs use specular highlights as visual cues to convey a sense of surface curvature when rendering 3D objects. However, many CAD programs exhibit problems in sampling specular highlights because the specular lighting computations are only performed at the vertices of the mesh used to represent the object, and interpolation is used to estimate lighting across the surface of the object. Problems occur when the mesh vertices are not dense enough, resulting in insufficient sampling of the specular lighting. This in turn results in highlights with brightness proportionate to the distance from mesh vertices, ultimately compromising the visual cues that indicate curvature. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be solved simply by creating a denser mesh, as this can greatly reduce the efficiency of object rendering.\n\nCube maps provide a fairly straightforward and efficient solution to rendering stable specular highlights. Multiple specular highlights can be encoded into a cube map texture, which can then be accessed by interpolating across the surface's reflection vector to supply coordinates. Relative to computing lighting at individual vertices, this method provides cleaner results that more accurately represent curvature. Another advantage to this method is that it scales well, as additional specular highlights can be encoded into the texture at no increase in the cost of rendering. However, this approach is limited in that the light sources must be either distant or infinite lights, although fortunately this is usually the case in CAD programs.\n\nPerhaps the most advanced application of cube mapping is to create pre-rendered panoramic sky images which are then rendered by the graphical engine as faces of a cube at practically infinite distance with the view point located in the center of the cube. The perspective projection of the cube faces done by the graphics engine undoes the effects of projecting the environment to create the cube map, so that the observer experiences an illusion of being surrounded by the scene which was used to generate the skybox. This technique has found a widespread use in video games since it allows designers to add complex (albeit not explorable) environments to a game at almost no performance cost.\n\nCube maps can be useful for modelling outdoor illumination accurately. Simply modelling sunlight as a single infinite light oversimplifies outdoor illumination and results in unrealistic lighting. Although plenty of light does come from the sun, the scattering of rays in the atmosphere causes the whole sky to act as a light source (often referred to as skylight illumination). However, by using a cube map the diffuse contribution from skylight illumination can be captured. Unlike environment maps where the reflection vector is used, this method accesses the cube map based on the surface normal vector to provide a fast approximation of the diffuse illumination from the skylight. The one downside to this method is that computing cube maps to properly represent a skylight is very complex; one recent process is computing the spherical harmonic basis that best represents the low frequency diffuse illumination from the cube map. However, a considerable amount of research has been done to effectively model skylight illumination.\n\nBasic environment mapping uses a static cube map - although the object can be moved and distorted, the reflected environment stays consistent. However, a cube map texture can be consistently updated to represent a dynamically changing environment (for example, trees swaying in the wind). A simple yet costly way to generate dynamic reflections, involves building the cube maps at runtime for every frame. Although this is far less efficient than static mapping because of additional rendering steps, it can still be performed at interactive rates.\n\nUnfortunately, this technique does not scale well when multiple reflective objects are present. A unique dynamic environment map is usually required for each reflective object. Also, further complications are added if reflective objects can reflect each other - dynamic cube maps can be recursively generated approximating the effects normally generated using raytracing.\n\nAn algorithm for global illumination computation at interactive rates using a cube-map data structure, was presented at ICCVG 2002.\n\nAnother application which found widespread use in video games is projective texture mapping. It relies on cube maps to project images of an environment onto the surrounding scene; for example, a point light source is tied to a cube map which is a panoramic image shot from inside a lantern cage or a window frame through which the light is filtering. This enables a game developer to achieve realistic lighting without having to complicate the scene geometry or resort to expensive real-time shadow volume computations.\n\nA cube texture indexes six texture maps from 0 to 5 in order Positive X, Negative X, Positive Y, Negative Y, Positive Z, Negative Z. The images are stored with the origin at the lower left of the image. The Positive X and Y faces must reverse the Z coordinate and the Negative Z face must negate the X coordinate. If given the face, and texture coordinates formula_1, the non-normalized vector formula_2 can be computed by the function:\nvoid convert_cube_uv_to_xyz(int index, float u, float v, float *x, float *y, float *z)\nLikewise, a vector formula_2 can be converted to the face index and texture coordinates formula_1 with the function:\nvoid convert_xyz_to_cube_uv(float x, float y, float z, int *index, float *u, float *v)\n\nA large set of free cube maps for experimentation:\nhttp://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures\n\nMark VandeWettering took M. C. Escher's famous self-portrait Hand with Reflecting Sphere and reversed the mapping to obtain these cube map images: left, right, up, down, back, front.

At 13 days old, he was christened at Holy Trinity Church, Marylebone.\n\nHis elder brother was the celebrated Lord Dunsany, a prolific writer and author of more than 60 books.\n\nHe was educated at Cheam School and joined the Royal Navy at the age of 14, training aboard the stationary school ship HMS \"Britannia\" from July 1894 to 1896.\n\nHis parents were distant cousins who came from influential and wealthy families. His father was the 17th Lord Dunsany, one of the oldest titles in the Peerage of Ireland. His mother, Ernle, was the daughter of Col. Francis Augustus Plunkett Burton (son of Admiral Ryder Burton and his wife, Anne Plunkett, the daughter of Randal Plunkett, 13th Baron Dunsany) and Sarah Charlotte Elizabeth Sawbridge-Erle-Drax (died 1905; daughter of John Sawbridge and his wife, Jane, daughter of Richard Erle-Drax-Grosvenor). Following the death of her brother, Richard, Jane became the sole heiress of Charborough House and other Erle-Drax estates. \nAfter his grandmother Jane's death in 1905, Sir Reginald's mother added the additional surname Ernle on 20 December 1905 (becoming Ernle Plunkett-Ernle), then added Erle and Drax on 20 December 1906 (becoming Ernle Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax), both by royal license.\n\nShe died in 1916, leaving Reginald the majority of her vast estates in Dorset, Kent, Surrey, Wiltshire, Yorkshire, and the West Indies. He assumed the additional surnames of Ernle-Erle-Drax on 4 October 1916 by royal licence. His long series of titles, Christian names, surnames and post-nominals has made him famous beyond his career as an admiral in the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1896, Drax passed out of the \"Britannia\" as a midshipman. He was promoted Lieutenant on 15 January 1901. At his own request, he received an unusual appointment to the Staff College, Camberley, to conduct an in-depth study of the subject of staff training and its application – \"then quite unthought of in the higher naval circles\" – to the needs of the Navy.\n\nIn 1909, the Admiralty privately published his book, \"Modern Naval Tactics\". He hoped that it would contribute to a projected official tactical handbook. It drew on an analysis of gunnery from the recent experience of the Battle of Tsushima. He expected that visibility in the North Sea would limit the maximum range of battle fleet duels to 10,000 yards, but recognised that the need to stay outside improving torpedo range would increase gunnery ranges.\n\nHe also discussed in the book how to utilise cruisers as a fast wing to the battle fleet; the possible tactics of an inferior fleet, such as the High Seas Fleet; and the impact of ships zigzagging would have on gunnery.\n\nDrax's book was dismissed by the skeptical older generation of admirals, who thought it highly presumptuous for a lowly lieutenant to write with authority on naval tactics. However, the book did succeed in making Drax a man of note. In 1912, when Winston Churchill instituted the Admiralty War Staff, Drax was the first of a dozen officers selected to attend the new staff officer course. He was promoted to commander during the course and then appointed War Staff Officer to Sir David Beatty in the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, an appointment he held until his promotion in 1916.\n\nHe served during the First World War aboard the battlecruiser HMS \"Lion\" and was present at the naval battles of Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank and Jutland. He was promoted captain on 30 June 1916.\n\nHe was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1918 for his command of HMS \"Blanche\".\n\nDrax held a series of senior naval appointments between the wars. From 1919 to 1922, he was Director of the Naval Staff College, Greenwich. He then served as President of the Naval Allied Control Commission in Germany from 1923 to 1924.\n\nAs a Rear Admiral, he commanded the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet from 1929 to 1930. From 1930 to 1932 he was ashore in the Admiralty as Director of Naval Mobilisation Department that became the Department of Manning.\n\nPromoted to Vice Admiral on 24 September 1932, he held from 1932 to 1934 the much-sought post of Commander of the America and West Indies Squadron.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938, he was Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.\n\nHe was the British half of the Anglo-French delegation sent to Moscow in August 1939 to discuss a possible alliance with the USSR. As an indication of the low priority the Allied governments put on the mission, it was sent by sea. The Soviets did not take the delegation seriously because Drax did not have any power to make decisions without the approval of the British government, rendering him next to powerless.\n\nIn December 1939, Drax was appointed Commander-in-Chief, The Nore serving until 1941. It was an important post, as he was responsible for the protection of the east coast convoys from Scotland to London. He faced the multiple threats of acoustic mines and magnetic mines as well as attacks from the air and by surface vessels, especially after the fall of the Netherlands and of Belgium.\n\nAs the war continued, advancing years caused him to retire from the active navy list and to join the British Home Guard. Nonetheless, he went to sea from 1943 to 1945 as a convoy commodore during the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\nAlongside Admiral Herbert Richmond and Vice-Admiral Kenneth Dewar, Drax was considered to be an intellectual with controversial views, including the need for naval reform.\n\nHe was an early pioneer of solar heating.\n\nHis friend, James Bond novelist Ian Fleming, named the character Sir Hugo Drax in his book \"Moonraker\" as a tribute.\n\n\nIn 1916, he married Kathleen Chalmers. They had four daughters and one son. \nTheir youngest daughter, Mary (1925–2017), married Robert Rothschild in her second marriage. \nTheir son, Henry Walter Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax (1928–2017), is the father of Richard Drax, Conservative MP for South Dorset since the 2010 general election.\n"}

Releasing material as Cicero, he went on to have minor success in the early 1990s.\n\nCicero was born in Long Island, but when his parents divorced, he moved to Livingston, Scotland. He attended a Pet Shop Boys concert in Glasgow in 1988 and gave a demo tape to Peter Andreas, Pet Shop Boys' personal assistant. Andreas contacted Cicero with an offer of artist management and later, when Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe heard Cicero's material, they signed him up to their recently formed Spaghetti label, licensed through Polydor.\n\nCicero released his début single \"Heaven Must Have Sent You Back to Me\" on August 12, 1991. Despite promotion from the artist and Pet Shop Boys, the single failed to chart. The follow-up, \"Love is Everywhere\", reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1992. The third single release was \"That Loving Feeling\" which reached number 46 in April 1992. The latter two singles were co-produced by Pet Shop Boys.\n\nHis debut album, \"Future Boy\", was released in June 1992. The album was produced by David Jacob, with the exceptions of \"Love is Everywhere\" and \"That Loving Feeling\", which were produced by Pet Shop Boys, and \"Cloud 9\" and \"Sonic Malfunction\", which Cicero produced himself. Pet Shop Boys also remixed \"Heaven Must Have Sent You Back To Me\" for the album, and also received keyboard and backing vocal credit for the album. The album did not chart, but to promote it, a new version of \"Heaven Must Have Sent You Back to Me\" was released as the fourth single and charted at number 70. The music video for the single was directed by Chris Lowe.\n\nOn November 2, 1992, Cicero released a fifth single \"Live for Today\" with Sylvia Mason-James providing backing vocals. The single was taken from the Pet Shop Boys produced soundtrack to the film, \"The Crying Game\", but it failed to chart. The following year, after the success of the title track, sung by Boy George, it was planned to re-release the single, but this never happened.\n\nCicero released nothing further through Spaghetti Records, although he was still signed with them until 1996. The Pet Shop Boys' fan club magazine regularly gave updates about him, saying that he was working on new tracks and he even came close to a duet release that year with a singer called Bianca, who had been spotted on the television show \"Stars in Their Eyes\".\n\nBy late 1996, Cicero moved to Clubscene Records, later merged into Academy Street Records in Scotland and his brother Mike took over as manager. He supported Take That on tour.\n\nCicero featured as one of the mystery guests in the episode of \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", broadcast on October 9, 2008 on BBC Two.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216951", "title": "Nganasan language", "text": "Nganasan language\n\nThe Nganasan language (formerly called , \"tavgiysky\", or , \"tavgiysko-samoyedsky\" in Russian; from the ethnonym , \"tavgi\") is a moribund Samoyedic language spoken by the Nganasan people. In 2010 it was spoken by only 125 out of 860 Nganasan people in the southwestern and central parts of the Taymyr Peninsula.\n\nNganasan is the most divergent language of the Samoyedic branch of the Uralic language family (Janhunen 1998). There are two main dialects, Avam (, \"avamsky govor\") and Vadeyev (). Vocabulary can be traced to elements of the unknown substrate origin, that are roughly twice more common in Nganasan than in other Samoyedic languages like Nenets or Enets, and bear no apparent resemblance to the neighbouring Tungusic and Yukaghir languages. The source of this substrate remains a mystery so far.\n\nThe language has 10 vowels and about 20 consonant phonemes.\n\nSeveral bisyllabic sequences of vowels are possible:\n\nOne of the main features of Nganasan is consonant gradation, which concerns the consonant phonemes and their nasal combinations .\nThe language's Cyrillic-based alphabet was devised in the 1990s:\n\nNouns in Nganasan have the grammatical categories of number (singular, dual, plural), case (nominative, genitive, accusative, lative, locative, elative, prolative, comitative) and possessivity (non-possessive versus possessive forms). Nganasan lacks determiners; however, the possessive forms of second person singular and third person singular can be used to express definiteness (Katzschmann, 2008).\n\nNganasan has personal, demonstrative, interrogative, negative and determinative pronouns. Personal pronouns are not inflected: their grammatical case forms coincide and their local case forms are expressed by the corresponding possessed forms of the postposition na-. Other pronouns are inflected like nouns (Helimski, 1998).\n\nVerbs agree with their subjects in person and number, and have three conjugation types. Like other Samoyedic languages, Nganasan has the opposition of perfective and imperfective verbs.\n\nThe subjective conjugation is used when there is no object or the object is focused. The objective conjugation is used with transitive words. The reflexive conjugation is used for some intransitive verbs. Each conjugation type has its own personal endings. There are three subtypes of objective conjugation endings that correspond to object number. \n\nNganasan has a broad mood paradigm with nine forms: indicative, imperative, interrogative, inferential, renarrative, irrealis, optative, admissive-cohortive, debitive, abessive and prohibitive. Mood forms are mostly built with the help of affixation but special particles are also sometimes used. All mood forms, except the imperative, have the same personal suffixes. Tenses are distinguished in the indicative, imperative and interrogative moods (Tereščenko, 1979).\n\nMost corresponding imperfective and perfective stems have the same root, but in rare cases the roots can be different. The aspectual opposition between imperfective and perfective verbs remains semantic in most verbal forms. However, in the indicative mood it is used to express present continuous and present perfect meanings, respectively. In this case, the opposition is present formally: imperfective verbs take imperfective suffixes and the perfective ones have the perfective suffixes (Helimski, 1998). Imperfective verbs can also express future meanings. These forms are not considered tense in the strict sense. The proper tense forms of past and future include past, past perfect, future, future-in-the past (Katzschmann, 2008).\n\nThe dominating word order in Nganasan is SOV, similar to other Samoyedic languages. However, Nganasan is considered to exhibit more freedom in word order than other languages of its group. According to Tereščenko (1979), other types of word orders are used for shifting the sentence focus, especially in emphatic speech. The focused constituent usually immediately precedes the verb. Wagner-Nagy (2010) suggests that Nganasan is similar to Hungarian in its behavior, in that its word order is determined by pragmatic factors rather than being fixed.\n\nOn the phrase level, the attributes within the noun phrase usually precede the noun and become focused when placed after it. Numerals and adjectives agree with the heads in case, and adjectives also agree with the head in number. The case agreement is only complete in grammatical cases; in locative cases the attribute gets genitive form. There are no prepositions in Nganasan, postpositions are composite parts of words and also require the attributes in genitive cases. Possession is expressed with genitive construction or by a possessive suffix attached to the possessed (Helimski, 1998; Katzschmann, 2008).\n\nNganasan is a pro-drop language: pronominal subjects are often omitted when the verb conjugation type is subjective (Tereščenko, 1979).\n\nStandard negation is expressed by negative auxiliary (ńi-) followed by the main verb in connegative form marked with ʔ, e.g. ńi-ndɨ-m konɨʔ \"I do not go\". All inflectional markers are taken by the negation auxiliary (Gusev, 2015). Objects in the form of personal, negative or demonastrative pronouns can be inserted between the negative auxiliary and the main verb (Wagner-Nagy, 2011). There are a few negative verbs other than ni-, such as kasa — \"nearly\", ləði — \"vainly\", əku — \"maybe\", and ŋuəli — \"of course\", but their functionality is restricted, with only ni- having a full paradigm.\n\nExistential sentences are negated with the negative existential predicate d'aŋku or its derivative stem d'anguj-. D'aŋku can only be used in present indicative as it behaves like a noun: it takes nominal predicative endings. D'anguj- (a composite of d'aŋku and ij- \"be\") is used for all other tense/mood combinations.\n\nSubordination is typically formed by constructions with non-finite verbal forms. Such constructions are usually placed before the constituents they modify. The relative construction is always placed immediately before the modified constituent, whereas other types of constructions allow other constituents to interfere. The word order in such construction is the same as in simple sentences (Tereščenko, 1973).\n\nCoordination is most often achieved by means of intonation. Sometimes pronominal and adverbial derivatives can be used as conjunctions. For example, adverb ŋonə 'also' can be used as conjunction. The category of conjunctions may be undergoing formation under the influence of Russian (Tereščenko, 1973).\n\n\n"}

The label gained prominence after the release of PJ Harvey's debut album \"Dry\" in 1992, and subsequently found further success in the late 1990s and early 2000s with albums by indie rock artists such as Mclusky and Electrelane. The label was closed in 2008.\n\nToo Pure started off as an experimental label and built its reputation by releasing primarily alternative/independent music which its founders felt was being ignored by major labels. At its inception Too Pure was largely preoccupied by the so-called Camden Lurch scene, through its 'Sausage Machine' night in North London (documented by its \"Now That's Disgusting Music\" (1990) compilation). The label discovered PJ Harvey but was struggling to hold on to the artist after the success of single \"Sheela Na Gig\", as an industry feeding frenzy brought in a host of major labels. Eventually Too Pure secured UK release rights as long as the album was licensed to Island Records for the rest of the world. Island picked up all futures of the band at the same time.\n\n4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell bought into the company to help the founders fund the signing of PJ Harvey, who was discovered at the Sausage Machine gigs. This enabled the label to release the PJ Harvey debut album \"Dry\" and develop and sign more artists. The label was briefly distributed in the US by Rick Rubin's American Recordings through Warner Bros. Records from 1995 to 1997 in a deal done by former agent and American Recordings exec Marc Geiger, in conjunction with founder Richard Roberts. Nick West, an old friend of Richard Roberts and formerly of Fiction Records and Polygram, was brought in to run Too Pure US, out of American Recordings' offices in Burbank, CA. The label had some notable successes at college radio in the US, with both Laika and Long Fin Killie playing Loolapalooza. Laika toured with both Radiohead and Tricky. The contract was bought out by American Recordings parent company Warner Bros in April 1997, after American Recordings hit financial difficulties.\n\nToo Pure became majority owned by the Beggars Group, taking over and increasing the shareholding previously owned by Watts-Russell. Remaining founder Paul Cox and MD Nick West were minority shareholders. Co-founder and mainman, Richard Roberts moved to Australia in 1997, being replaced by Nick West. From 2001 the label was run by Jason White, formerly of the Mean Fiddler and the former press officer at Too Pure, following the departure of Nick West, who'd returned from the US to run the label as MD from 1997. Nick West also established the Derrière de la Garage publishing arm of the label in order to sign Hefner's publishing.\n\nOn 7 July 2008, it was announced on its Web site that Too Pure \"is no more\" and that \"the artists currently on those labels will be released through 4AD,\" yet it will continue operating its Too Pure Singles Club. In 2009 Paul Riddlesworth took over the reins of the Too Pure singles club signing bands that include Pulled Apart by Horses, Friendship, Bear Hands, JEFF the Brotherhood, The Lucid Dream, DZ Deathrays, Fear Of Men, The Lovely Eggs, Dead Skeletons, Deaf Club, False Advertising, Seize The Chair, Best Friends and HOOKWORMS. In 2013, the roster added Beard Of Wolves, Seasfire, Menace Beach, Black Moth, Department M, Lola Colt and Sealings. The Singles Club continues to run as a subscription based label.\n\n\n"}

Both describe the degree to which two random variables or sets of random variables tend to deviate from their expected values in similar ways.\n\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are two random variables, with means (expected values) \"μ\" and \"μ\" and standard deviations \"σ\" and \"σ\", respectively, then their covariance and correlation are as follows:\nso that\n\nwhere \"E\" is the expected value operator. Notably, correlation is dimensionless while covariance is in units obtained by multiplying the units of the two variables. \n\nIf \"Y\" always takes on the same values as \"X\", we have the covariance of a variable with itself (i.e. formula_2), which is called the variance and is more commonly denoted as formula_3 the square of the standard deviation. The \"correlation\" of a variable with itself is always 1 (except in the degenerate case where the two variances are zero because \"X\" always takes on the same single value, in which case the correlation does not exist since its computation would involve division by 0). More generally, the correlation between two variables is 1 (or –1) if one of them always takes on a value that is given exactly by a linear function of the other with respectively a positive (or negative) slope.\n\nAlthough the values of the theoretical covariances and correlations are linked in the above way, the probability distributions of sample estimates of these quantities are not linked in any simple way and they generally need to be treated separately.\n\nWith any number of random variables in excess of 1, the variables can be stacked into a random vector whose \"i\" element is the \"i\" random variable. Then the variances and covariances can be placed in a covariance matrix, in which the (\"i,j\") element is the covariance between the \"i\" random variable and the \"j\" one. Likewise, the correlations can be placed in a correlation matrix.\n\nIn the case of a time series which is stationary in the wide sense, both the means and variances are constant over time (E(\"X\") = E(\"X\") =\" μ\" and var(\"X\") = var(\"X\") and likewise for the variable \"Y\"). In this case the cross-covariance and cross-correlation are functions of the time difference:\n\nIf \"Y\" is the same variable as \"X\", the above expressions are called the \"autocovariance\" and \"autocorrelation\":\n"}

Warren maintained that the just compensation for labor (or for its product) could only be an equivalent amount of labor (or a product embodying an equivalent amount). Thus, profit, rent, and interest were considered unjust economic arrangements. As Samuel Edward Konkin III put it, \"the labor theory of value recognizes no distinction between profit and plunder.\"\n\nIn keeping with the tradition of Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\", the \"cost\" of labor is considered to be the subjective cost; i.e., the amount of suffering involved in it.\n\nThe principle was set forth in Warren's \"Equitable Commerce\" (among other writings) and has been called a \"mainstay of 19th century individualist anarchism.\" It was further advocated and popularized by Benjamin Tucker in his individualist anarchist periodical \"Liberty\", and in his books. Tucker explained it so:\n\nWarren put his principle into practice in 1827 by establishing an experimental \"equity store,\" called the Cincinnati Time Store, where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. This scheme was exactly that advocated by Pierre Proudhon some years later under the name \"mutuellisme\"; however, it is believed that Proudhon developed his ideas independently.\n\n"}

He was hanged in 1876 for murdering his second wife Mary Ann Brown (née Tindall).\n\nBrown was born in Oxfordshire, England in 1837, the eldest son of Thomas Brown and older brother of Maitland Brown. In 1840, the Brown family emigrated to Western Australia, arriving in March 1841. They initially settled at York. In 1850, the family took up land in the Champion Bay area, where they established Glengarry. However, the following year Brown senior was appointed to an official position as magistrate in Fremantle, and the family moved there, all except for Brown who stayed to manage Glengarry.\n\nDuring the 1850s, Brown spent most of his time at Glengarry. He was often the only family member there and he eventually was responsible for its management. Although primarily a sheep station, the Browns developed a passion and industry for horse breeding. Over time, Glengarry became one of the most successful racehorse breeding establishments in the colony for thoroughbred race horses and cavalry re-mounts that were sold to India.\n\nBrown undertook a number of exploring expeditions between 1852 and 1863. In 1852, he explored the country behind Glengarry with Major Logue. Two years later, he was a member of Robert Austin's expedition of 1854. On that expedition, he shot and collected the type specimen of the Australian night parrot (\"Pezoporus occidentalis\") on break-away ranges north west of Mount Magnet near Mount Farmer. In 1859, he explored the higher reaches of the Murchison River with William Dalgety Moore to look for new land. In June 1862, he again explored up the Murchison, this time with Thomas Burges.\n\nIn 1863, Brown was part of an expedition to the Glenelg River. The explorers also included the naturalist Dr James Martin, Brown's brother Aubrey, Samuel Hamersley, and B. D. Clarkson, and was financed by a group of pastoralists including Brown and his brother, Hamersley, and L. C. Burges senior. The following year, Brown and other people associated with the expedition sued Burges and others, seeking money they believed was owed to them. The case was eventually settled out of court.\n\nIn 1859, Brown married Mary Eliza Dircksey Wittenoom. They had four surviving children (Blanche, Edith, Forrest, and Clarence). Mary died in 1868 during child birth.\n\nIn June 1863, while away on the Glenelg River expedition, Brown's father died, and the brothers formed a partnership under which they managed Glengarry—Messrs K, A & M Brown. Over the next decade, the Champion Bay area suffered severely from drought, wheat rust and sheep scab. By 1871, Glengarry was heavily mortgaged and running at a loss.\n\nIn 1872, Brown withdrew from the partnership and was paid out approximately £7,500 and left the Colony. He re-located to Melbourne, Victoria to continue his horse-racing pursuits. He was the first Western Australian to enter the Melbourne Cup but his best horse at the time Victorian finished fifth last in the 1873 Melbourne Cup race. Of his time in Melbourne, Peter Cowan (1988) wrote:He apparently began to lose considerable sums, he became increasingly restless, and drank heavily. His behaviour from this time became erratic. He was given to outbursts of temper, compounded, and perhaps in part caused, by drinking.While in Melbourne, Brown married Mary Ann Tindall (born 1849). They re-located to New Zealand and for some time operated the Courthouse Hotel in Thames (outside of Auckland). In the years 1874 and 1875, they produced two children, Rose and Amy. In Thames, Brown showed a range of anti-social behavior that included two court appearances for assault on a local shop keeper and threatening to kill his wife. The family returned to Western Australia in September 1875, by which time the marriage was in trouble, and there are a range of further references to them constantly and openly quarrelling. On their return journey from Melbourne to Fremantle, the couple had a physical altercation that was witnessed by John Forrest. The couple and their children arrived in Champion Bay in October 1875. During this time, Brown continued to show a range of anti-social behaviours, and, on Monday 3 January 1876, during the process of packing up their house to move to other accommodation, he shot his wife dead.\n\nAt trial, he elected not to provide any explanation or excuse for his actions and his legal team mounted a defence based on diminished responsibility. The prosecution succeeded in proving the charge at the third trial (the first two trials resulting in hung juries). Brown was found guilty of wilful murder and sentenced to death by the Chief Justice Archibald Burt and hanged on 10 June 1876 at Perth Gaol. The record of inquest proclaimed by Police Magistrate E Landor states that Brown died by hanging.\n\nMany years later, Rose Burges, the eldest daughter of Brown's second marriage, claimed that while travelling in America she had met her father in a hotel. Because of this, a story persists that Brown's older brother had arranged Brown's escape to the United States. This is considered as improbable, and there is a newspaper report describing how Maitland Brown stood next to Brown on the dock when the bolt was drawn and that Brown's body had to be cut free from the rope and was later buried by relatives, possibly at Guildford (where his mother resided at the time).\n\nBrown's second child by his first marriage was Edith Cowan (\"nee\" Brown). Edith's grandson was Peter Cowan, a celebrated Western Australian author who wrote detailed biographies on Maitland Brown and Edith Cowan. Julie Lewis has suggested that Brown's life and death:is to some extent responsible for Peter Cowan's biographical method and also the motivating force behind some of his fiction. The effect of isolation, of a hostile environment, of grief and emotional deprivation on a person's spirit and the ways in which an individual reacts to these things - mostly in control, but occasionally showing uncharacteristic violence – are recurring themes – for example – \"The Empty Street\" – a man driven by unseen forces reacts with violence.\n\n"}

In the late 1980s he began producing original material under the names of Positiv Noize, Perfectly Ordinary People and Pisces, with the latter experimenting with the sound of techno with the single \"Take Me Higher\".\n\nIn 1990 Freeland released the single \"Way Out West\" under the name of Man With No Name. The track sampled lines from the western film, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", and was backed with the acid house track \"From Within The Mind of My 909\", which was later featured on Richard Sen's 2012 compilation \"This Ain't Chicago: The Underground Sound Of UK House & Acid 1987–1991\" on Strut Records.\n\nFurther singles in the early nineties, such as \"Geddit?/120 Something\" and the EP \"From Within\", echoed the sound of Detroit techno and British rave. It was during this time that Freeland attended one of the first UK trance parties Concept in Dance, where Paul Oakenfold introduced producer Ian St Paul to Freeland and his music. Following this, Freeland produced several tracks under the MWNN title for two Concept in Dance compilations, \"Tribal Science\" and \"Digital Alchemy\". One of these tracks was \"Sugar Rush\", which would later be released in remixed form as a single.\n\nHaving refined his sound to a harder, more melodic style of Goa trance, Freeland worked closely with Ian St Paul, Graham Wood and Raja Ram under the name of The Infinity Project, as well as contributing the single \"Teleport\" to the first TIP Records compilation. \"Teleport\" was simultaneously released on Dragonfly Records, where he again contributed tracks to a number of their compilations.\n\nBack on the Concept in Dance label, Freeland released his first full-length album \"Moment of Truth\". The singles \"Floor-Essence\" and \"Sugar Rush\" were taken from the album, though released on Perfecto. Freeland's connection with Perfecto led to him touring with labelmates such as Mozaic and Quivver, while the label's promotional plugging led to his singles reaching the UK Singles Chart.\n\nFreeland also contributed to Positiva's rainforest charity project 'Earth Trance' in 1996 with the track \"Osmosis\". The compilation project featured tracks by trance artists across the scene and raised money for charity in the process.\n\nThe success of Man With No Name was recognised by the end of 1995, with Muzik voting \"Floor-Essence\" as the twelfth best single of the year, and Moment of Truth being ranked as 26th Best Album of the year. Freeland was also a highly sought-after remixer, although he 'politely refused' to remix JX's 'There's Nothing I Won't Do' when asked by Hooj Choons.\n\nFreeland continued to release material on Perfecto for the rest of the 1990s, with a second album \"Earth Moving The Sun\" in 1998.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Progressive psytrance gained popularity, and Freeland's sound altered accordingly. Signing briefly onto Brighton trance label Atomic Records, a few further Man With No Name singles were released, while back on Dragonfly Freeland remixed \"Teleport\" into a more progressive 'Stripped' mix. A third album, again on Dragonfly, was then released in 2003.\n\nThe last decade has seen little new material from Freeland, though he continues to tour the globe as Man With No Name. A few new tracks were released on TIP Records' compilation \"Future Sound Masters\" in 2005, which sparked rumours of a fourth album.\n\nIn 2011, Perfecto Fluoro released three new remixes of the tracks \"Floor-Essence\", \"Sugar Rush\" and \"Teleport\", with contributions from Astrix and Nick Sentience. This was followed by Freeland remixing \"Remember Love\" by DJ's United, a collaboration between Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyk and Armin Van Buuren.\n\nAs Man With No Name, Freeland was a popular choice for remixes. Initially remixing tracks for Perfecto labelmates Grace and BT, he went on to remix four singles for Hooj Choons, two for Juno Reactor and even remixed a track for the Human League.\n\nAs well as being a contributor to The Infinity Project, Freeland also produced tracks for Goa artists such as Dino Psaras, Cydonia, Psychaos and Ayahuasca. He also released a track under the name of Yogi & Grey One entitled \"Big Trouble in Outer Space\", which was later re-released under the Man With No Name title.\n\nFrench Goa trance group Transwave paid tribute to Freeland, dedicating their track \"Land of Freedom\" to 'M.W.N.N.'. The track is featured on their album \"Phototropic\" (1996).\n\nIn 2017 psytrance producer Talamasca dedicated a track on his album \"A Brief History of Goa Trance\" to Man With No Name, using melodies from several of his tracks.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the last Chief of the Imperial General Staff (1961–64) and the first Chief of the General Staff (1964–65), and, as such, the professional head of the British Army. He later became Chief of the Defence Staff (1965–67), the professional head of the entire British Armed Forces. He served with distinction during the Second World War, fighting from 1942 to 1945 in North Africa, Italy and Western Europe, became the youngest divisional commander in the British Army, and later advised the British government on the response to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.\n\nRichard Amyatt Hull was born in Cosham, Hampshire on 7 May 1907, the son of Major General Sir Charles Hull, and Muriel Helen Hull (née Dobell), and was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Hull entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 17th/21st Lancers, a cavalry regiment of the British Army, on 1 November 1926. Posted with his regiment to Egypt in October 1928, he was promoted to lieutenant on 7 May 1931 and to captain on 1 June 1933 before going on to India in October of that year. He served as adjutant of his regiment when it was converted into a mechanised role and, from 1938–1939, he attended the Staff College, Quetta.\n\nBy the time of the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Hull had just returned from India. After serving in the Directorate of Staff Duties at the War Office from February 1940, Hull was appointed Officer Commanding (OC) 'C' Squadron of his regiment in March 1941 and then Commanding Officer of the regiment in August 1941 before becoming GSO1 to the 1st Canadian Armoured Division in June 1942. The regiment had been serving as part of the 26th Armoured Brigade of the 6th Armoured Division since the division's formation in September 1940. The division's first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major General John Crocker, passing briefly to Major General Herbert Lumsden and then Charles Gairdner, before, in May 1942, finally passing to Major General Charles Keightley, who, like Hull, was a fellow cavalryman.\n\nIn the days leading up to Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, for which the 6th Armoured Division was to take part in as part of the British First Army, Hull was promoted to colonel and became second-in-command (2IC) of the 26th Armoured Brigade. Elements of the First Army landed in North Africa on 8 November 1942, with Hull's regiment being among them. A week later, shortly after landing, Hull was ordered to form \"Blade Force\", based around the 17th/21st Lancers, along with part of the 1st Derbyshire Yeomanry (the 6th Armoured Division's reconnaissance regiment) and anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns, and to capture Tunis as soon as possible (see the Run for Tunis). Sending his units by train to Constantine, he arrived there on the evening of 16 November, and, the following day, was on the border of Tunisia. Hull then headed towards Medjez el Bab, which was held by the French against the Germans. The armoured cars of the 1st Derbyshire Yeomanry arrived on 18 November, with the rest of \"Blade Force\" arriving soon after, but, lacking infantry support, were unable to capture the bridge.\n\nHull, with the 36th Infantry Brigade on his left flank, and the 11th Infantry Brigade (both from Major General Vyvyan Evelegh's 78th \"Battleaxe\" Division) on his right flank, now decided to turn west, hoping to get to Tunis by a more northern route, with the aid of elements of the U.S. 1st Armored Division. However, this attempt also failed as the Germans had received reinforcements and, by the end of the month, the Allies were on the defensive and forced to withdraw from their positions. In December \"Blade Force\" was reabsorbed into the 6th Armoured Division, Hull returning to the 2IC of the 26th Armoured Brigade. For his services in the early stages of the Tunisian Campaign Hull was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 11 February 1943.\n\nBy February 1943, the brigade was at Thala. In the middle of the month the Germans launched their attack at Kasserine Pass against US troops, forcing them to retreat. Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson, GOC British First Army, appointed Brigadier Cameron Nicholson, 2IC of the 6th Armoured Division, gave him command of Nickforce, an improvised formation. Nickforce held on until further reinforcements and fought the Germans to a standstill.\n\nHull was then promoted to brigadier and took command of the 12th Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Mixed Division (which was composed of the 10th and 12th Infantry Brigades and the 21st Tank Brigade), then commanded by Major General John Hawkesworth, which had arrived in Tunisia the month before, on 17 April. The brigade was heavy fighting just a week after Hull's assumption of command, where it was involved in taking a key position named Peter's Corner which, despite air and infantry tank support from the 21st Tank Brigade, failed with some 900 casualties, with the Germans putting up a tenacious resistance. Hull's brigade was relieved by the 78th Division's 11th Brigade soon afterwards and, due to its heavy losses, only managed to play a relatively minor role in the First Army's capture of Tunis, which fell on 6 May 1943, the campaign in Tunisia itself coming to an end a week later with the surrender of 250,000 Axis troops.\n\nOver a month later, on 19 June Hull returned to the 6th Armoured Division, still commanded by Major General Charles Keightley, where he assumed command of the 26th Armoured Brigade, which was then training in North Africa for operations in Italy, being mentioned in despatches for his services on 27 January 1944, before returning to the United Kingdom, becoming Deputy Director of Staff Duties (DDST) at the War Office in December 1943.\n\nHull remained in this post until August 1944 when, promoted to major general, he succeeded Major General Alexander Galloway as GOC of the 1st Armoured Division, then serving on the Italian front, making Hull the youngest divisional commander in the British Army during the Second World War. The division, a pre-war Regular Army formation, was composed of the 2nd Armoured and 18th Lorried Infantry Brigades along with supporting units, and was a veteran of the British Eighth Army that had fought throughout most of the North African Campaign and with the First Army in the final stages of the campaign in Tunisia but, since then, had seen no action, with tanks being considered unsuitable in the mountains of Italy. The division was assigned to V Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Charles Keightley (who, formerly as Hull's superior as GOC 6th Armoured, had recommended him for command of the 1st Armoured Division), with I Canadian Corps and II Polish Corps on its right, next to the Adriatic Sea. The Eighth Army commander, Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese (who had taught Hull at the Staff College, Quetta before the war), intended to launch an offensive to breach the Gothic Line, believing he could reach the Po Valley. The operation, codenamed Olive, began on the night of 25 August, with the 1st Armoured held in reserve. Keightley, the corps commander, planned for the 46th Division, under Major General John Hawkesworth, to breach the German defences, allowing Hull's division to exploit its success and drive on to the Po Valley.\n\nThe 46th Division's progress was initially successful and Keightley decided to bring the 1st Armoured earlier than planned, although the division was, curiously, held back 100 miles from the enemy and, by the time it reached the front, was exhausted. However, on 3 September, the division was committed to battle around the town of Coriano and suffered heavy losses before it was repelled. Reinforced with the 43rd Gurkha Lorried Brigade and a Canadian brigade, the division tried again on 12 September, this time with more success, and the Germans fell back before again halting the division a week later, inflicting heavy losses on Hull's division, particularly in tanks.\n\nOn 24 September, however, the division received the news that it was to be disbanded, due to a severe manpower shortage conflicting the British Army at this stage of the war, particularly in Italy, and the division ceased to exist by late October, although it was not officially disbanded until 1 January 1945 and the 2nd Armoured Brigade survived as an independent formation, although the 18th Brigade was broken up and the men sent to bring up other units, mainly the 46th Division, which had suffered heavy casualties, up to strength.\n\nFollowing the 1st Armoured Division's disbandment, in late November, Hull succeeded Major General Philip Gregson-Ellis as GOC of the 5th Infantry Division, another Regular Army formation, then serving in Palestine. Composed of the 13th, 15th and 17th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional troops, the 5th Division, nicknamed \"The Globe Trotters\" (after having served in nearly every theatre of war), had fought in Sicily and Italy from July 1943 until July 1944 and was resting in Palestine, and was then preparing to return to Italy.\n\nOriginally intending to rejoin the Eighth Army in Italy, the 5th Division, after landing there briefly in February, was instead diverted to Northwestern Europe to reinforce the British Second Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey, for the final Allied offensive on the Western Front, the invasion of Germany itself. The Second Army formed part of Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group. The division arrived in Belgium in early March, and on 17 April was assigned to Lieutenant General Evelyn Barker's VIII Corps, then just a few miles from the western bank of the Elbe river. The division crossed the river after facing light resistance and was not involved in much fighting thereafter and managed to enter the city of Lübeck in Northern Germany on 3 May, just a few days before the end of World War II in Europe. Having been promoted to the substantive rank of major on 7 May 1945, Hull was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1945.\n\nShortly after the war in Europe came to an end, it was proposed that Hull would exchange places with Major General Lashmer \"Bolo\" Whistler, GOC of the 3rd Infantry Division, and take the division to the Far East to fight the Japanese, with Whistler becoming GOC of the 5th Division in Hull's place. However, the surrender of Japan in September 1945 cancelled these plans and Hull remained with the 5th Division on occupation duties in Germany until May 1946.\n\nPromoted to colonel on 13 April 1946, he again succeeded Major General Philip Gregson-Ellis, this time as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley in May 1946, an assignment appointed to only the most promising officers. Having been promoted again to major general on 13 June 1947, he became Director of Staff Duties at the War Office in September 1948 and Chief Army Instructor at the Imperial Defence College on 1 January 1951. He became chief of staff at headquarters Middle East Land Forces on 26 January 1953. He was appointed GOC British Troops in Egypt on 15 June 1954 and, having been promoted to lieutenant general on 29 September 1954 and advanced to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1956, he became Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 5 October 1956. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief Far East Land Forces on 25 June 1958 and, having been promoted to full general on 13 February 1959, and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours 1961.\n\nHull became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 1 November 1961 (restyled Chief of the General Staff in April 1964). In this capacity he advised the British government on the response to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. Having been promoted to field marshal on 8 February 1965, he was appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of the British Armed Forces, on 16 July 1965. He finally retired from the British Army on 5 August 1967.\nHe was also appointed Colonel of the 17th/21st Lancers from July 1947, Honorary Colonel of the Cambridge University Contingent from 30 May 1958 and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Armoured Corps from April 1968.\n\nIn retirement he became a Non-Executive Director of Whitbread. He was appointed Constable of the Tower of London from 1 August 1970, Lord Lieutenant of Devon from 5 October 1978 and a Knight of the Order of the Garter on 23 April 1980.\n\nHis interests included shooting, fly fishing and gardening; he knew every plant in his garden by their English, Latin and local name. He died of cancer at his home, Beacon Downe in Pinhoe on 17 September 1989.\n\nIn 1934 he married Antoinette Labouchére de Rougement; they had a son and two daughters.\n\n\n"}

It is a six-passenger 2-door sedan that was designed by Rust Heinz of the H. J. Heinz family and Maurice Schwartz of the Bohman & Schwartz coachbuilding company in Pasadena, California. Although sometimes dismissed as a failure because it never entered production, the Corsair is regarded as ahead of its time because of its futuristic features, and styling cues such as faired-in fenders and a low profile.\n\nThe Phantom Corsair's steel-and-aluminum body measured just in height and incorporated fully skirted wheels and completely flush fenders while forgoing running boards. The car also lacked door handles, as the doors were instead opened electrically using push-buttons located on the exterior and the instrument panel. The instrument panel also featured a compass and altimeter, while a separate console above the windshield indicated when a door was ajar or if the car's lights or radio were turned on. The Corsair's body was mated to the \"most advanced chassis available in the United States\" at that time, the Cord 810. The Lycoming 80º V-8 engine-powered Cord chassis also featured front-wheel drive and an electrically operated four-speed pre-selector gearbox, as well as fully independent suspension and adjustable shock absorbers. Though these features from the Cord 810 chassis were all retained on the Phantom Corsair, the chassis was modified in order to accommodate the Corsair's large body. The body measured an impressive long and wide, enough to accommodate four people in the front row, including one person to the left of the driver. The back seats could only hold two passengers, however, in large part because of space limitations posed by on-board beverage cabinets.

However, Heinz's death in a car accident in July 1939 ended those plans, leaving the prototype Corsair as the only one ever built.\n\nThe Phantom Corsair now resides in the National Automobile Museum (also known as The Harrah Collection) in Reno, Nevada.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217135", "title": "Helen Merrill", "text": "Helen Merrill\n\nHelen Merrill (born Jelena Ana Milcetic; July 21, 1930) is an American jazz vocalist. Her first album, the eponymous 1955 release \"Helen Merrill\", was an immediate success and associated her with the first generation of bebop jazz musicians. After a prolific 1950s and '60s when she recorded with Charlie Parker and Clifford Brown, Merrill spent time recording and touring in Europe and Japan, falling into obscurity in the United States. In the 1980s and '90s, a contract with Verve Records and high-profile performances in America returned her to prominence. Noted for her emotional, sensual vocal performances, her career continues in its sixth decade with concerts and recordings.\n\nJelena Ana Milcetic was born in New York City in 1930 to Croatian immigrant parents. She began singing in jazz clubs in the Bronx in 1944 when she was fourteen. By the time she was sixteen, Merrill had taken up music full-time. In 1952, Merrill made her recording debut when she was asked to sing \"A Cigarette For Company\" with the Earl Hines Band; the song was released on the D'Oro label, created specifically to record Hines' band with Merrill. Etta Jones was in Hines' band at the time and she too sang on this session, which was reissued on the Xanadu label in 1985. At this time Merrill was married to musician Aaron Sachs. They divorced in 1956.\n\nMerrill was signed by Mercury Records to their EmArcy label. In 1954, Merrill recorded her first LP, an eponymous record featuring trumpeter Clifford Brown and bassist Oscar Pettiford. The album was produced and arranged by Quincy Jones, who was twenty-one years old. The success of \"Helen Merrill\" prompted Mercury to sign her for an additional four-album contract.\n\nMerrill's follow-up to \"Helen Merrill\" was the 1956 LP, \"Dream of You\", which was produced and arranged by arranger and pianist Gil Evans. His arrangements for Merrill laid the foundation for his work with Miles Davis.\n\nAfter recording sporadically through the late 1950s and 1960s, Merrill spent much of her time touring Europe, where she enjoyed more commercial success than she had in the United States. She settled for a time in Italy, recording an album there and doing concerts with jazz musicians Piero Umiliani, Chet Baker, Romano Mussolini, and Stan Getz. In 1960 arranger and composer Ennio Morricone, noted for his film scores, worked with Merrill on an EP, \"Helen Merrill Sings Italian Songs\", on the RCA Italiana label.\n\n\"Parole e Musica: Words and Music\" was recorded in Italy with Umiliani's orchestra in the early 1960s while Merrill was living there. The LP features the unusual additions preceding each song, of spoken translations of eloquent Italian word lyrics, complementing the ballads and torch songs.\n\nShe returned to the U.S. in the 1960s, but moved to Japan in 1966, staying after touring there and marrying Donald J. Brydon (of United Press International) in April 1967. She developed a following in Japan that remains strong to this day. In addition to recording while in Japan, Merrill became involved in other aspects of the music industry, producing albums for Trio Records and co-hosting a show on FEN (Armed Forces Radio and Television Service) with Bud Widom in Tokyo.\n\nMerrill returned to the U.S. in 1972. She recorded a bossa nova album, a Christmas album, and a Rodgers and Hammerstein album. In 1987, she and Gil Evans recorded fresh arrangements of \"Dream of You\" released under the title \"Collaboration\", becoming the most critically acclaimed of Merrill's albums in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1987 she co-produced \"Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter\". In 1995 she recorded \"\". \"Jelena Ana Milcetic a.k.a. Helen Merrill\" (2000) draws from her Croatian heritage as well as her American upbringing. The album combines jazz, pop, and blues songs with traditional Croatian songs sung in Croatian. She released the album \"Lilac Wine\" in 2003.\n\nMerrill has been married three times, first to musician Aaron Sachs, second to UPI vice president Donald J. Brydon, and third to arranger-conductor Torrie Zito.\n\nShe had one child from her first marriage, a son known professionally as Alan Merrill, who was a singer and songwriter who wrote and recorded the original (1975) version of the rock classic \"I Love Rock N Roll\" as lead vocalist of the British band Arrows.\n\n\nWith Billy Eckstine and Benny Carter\n\n\n"}

Under the guidance of superintendent J. Frank Foster, the commission opened ten new neighborhood parks, including Palmer Park, in an effort to create breathing space and recreational areas in the city's crowded tenement districts. These parks were built by Olmsted Brothers landscape architects and D.H. Burnham and Co. architects. The park is named for Potter Palmer, a successful businessman and real estate investor concerned with the development of Chicago. Palmer was responsible for reclaiming the acres of swampland north of the city's business district, which were developed into the Lake Shore Drive area. He built the original baseball field for the Cubs' predecessor, the Chicago White Stockings, and built the Palmer House Hotel.\n\nIn 1934, the city's 22 independent park commissions were consolidated into a new unified system, and Palmer Park became park of the Chicago Park District. Park district art director James McBurney painted three murals for Palmer Park as a Works Progress Administration project with money from the federal government. The three are: \"Native Americans,\" \"Explorers,\" and \"Dutch settlers.\" Other noteworthy McBurney murals are found at the Wentworth School, Tilden High School, and Woodlawn National Bank.\n\nThe park, located just south of Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy is open daily from dawn to dusk, with free admission.

The founder of the National Speleological Society, Bill Stephenson, said of the cave after his first visit: \"This is the most indescribably beautiful cave in the world, its beauty cannot be exaggerated, not even by a Texan.\"\n\nThe cave is formed in 100-million-year-old (Cretaceous) Segovia Limestone, of the Edwards Group. The formation of the cave itself probably occurred between 1.5 and 5 million years ago. The cave is formed primarily along a fault, which allowed gases to rise up from depths of around to then depths of about . At this depth, the gases mixed with water in the aquifer. The resulting highly acidic water dissolved out the limestone, forming the cave. Between 1 and 3 million years ago, the water drained from the cave. The famous mineral formations, known as speleothems, all formed after the water drained from the cave.\n\nThe cave's most famous formation was the butterfly. It was the only known formation like it in the world. It was formed by two fishtail helictite growths that share the same attachment point of the cave wall. In November, 2006, about a third of the right wing was broken off of the formation.\n\nThe first quarter-mile of the cave was known to local ranch-hands by the early 1900s. It was known by the name Mayfield Cave, after the landowner, Stanley Mayfield. In 1955, Stanley gave permission to four cavers from Dallas, who discovered a further seven miles, including what are now considered the most scenic areas.\n\nToday, of trail have been developed from the of explored cave. A steel gate was installed on June 15, 1957 at the entrance to protect the cave from vandalism. The cave was then re-named \"Secret Cave\" to protect its location.\nIn 1957, Jim Papadakis a member of the National Speleological Society, geologist and professional photographer fell in love with the cave. During Jim's many trips to the cave, he observed that the delicate cave formations were being destroyed by negligent explorers. Jim realized the only way to protect the \"Secret Cave\" would be to open it to the public as a showcase cave with guided tours. In February 1960, Jim negotiated a lease with Stanley Mayfield to develop the cave. The cave project began, which included a fenced access road, two miles of power line, a telephone line, a water-well was drilled and a small visitor center was built. Jim hired friend and caver, Jack Burch to help construct the trails and install electrical lighting which provided safe viewing for public tours.\n\nThe closest town is Sonora and the name is so pretty Jim decided to name the cave, “Caverns of Sonora.” The Cave was opened for public tours July 16, 1960.\nIn 1961, Jim sold the Caverns of Sonora to nine Sonora investors. They formed a corporation with Stanley Mayfield at the head. In April 1963, the Texas House of Representatives gave the Caverns of Sonora a special citation. On December 1, 1965 the National Park Service included the Caverns in the National Register of Natural Landmarks.\n\n"}

He has also put up or repeated hard sport climbs.\nDai was born on 23 August 1976 in Kagoshima and has been climbing since 1993. Despite his shorter stature at 165 cm and 58 kg Dai has excelled at a wide style of rock climbing at the highest level of difficulty. In 1996, Koyamada won the Japanese National Championship. This is the event which allowed him to become a professional rock climber. Four years later in 2000 Koyamada left the competitions, because he realized \"The real nature of my climbing resides in crags\". Dai made a name for himself on the rock early on by completing the first ascent (FA) of \"Logical Progression\" (9a) on 2001 November 27 in Joyama, Japan. At the time this was considered one of the most difficult sport climbs in the world. Koyamada was made world famous in 2004, when he journeyed to Australia and repeated every problem at the Hollow Mountain Cave (HMC) in the Grampians, problems put up by Fred Nicole and Klem Loskot and some of Australia's top boulderers. He then proceeded to link-up the problems in the HMC for the first ascent (FA) of \"The Wheel of Life\" (V16/8C+) on 2004 May 12. This climb has stood the test of time and remains a world class test piece for top level climbers. The level of V16 has been downgraded over the years.\nThe second ascent of \"The Wheel of Life\" was by Chris Webb Parsons on 13 Oct 2007. Later in 2004 Koyamada traveled to Switzerland and repeated Dreamtime on November 09. At the time Dreamtime was considered one of the hardest boulder problems in the world and is the first problem to ever receive a V15/8C grade. It has since broken and downgraded.\nOn October15, 2005 Koyamada repeated \"Action Directe\" (9a) in the Frankenjura, Germany and proclaimed it harder than any other route that he has climbed. Dai continues to push the limits of hard rock climbing. On April 4, 2017 at the age of 40 Koyamada climbed a new personal limit with the first ascent of Nayuta 8C+(V16) in Gero, Japan.\nKoyamada has possibly the longest tick list of difficult boulder problem ascents and hard boulder first ascents in the world. The only climber that compares is Daniel Woods and Jimmy Webb\n\n\n"}

She ends up at the home of the Worrall family, the local gentry. Their Greek butler, Frixos, thinks the woman is a fraud from the start. Mr. Worrall sends her to the magistrate to be tried for vagrancy, but Mrs. Worrall agrees to care for her. Mr. Gutch, a local printer and newspaper reporter, takes an interest in the case, especially after the woman claims via mime to be Princess Caraboo.\n\nGutch talks to the farm workers who found her and learns she had a book from the Magdalene Hospital in London on her. When the Worralls leave on a trip the servants inspect her for a tattoo, which they believe all natives of the South Seas have and are shocked to find Princess Caraboo has one on her thigh. Frixos tells Gutch he now thinks she's a genuine princess. Mr. Worrall uses her presence to recruit investors for the spice trade which will be facilitated by Princess Caraboo when she returns to her native land. Gutch brings in Professor Wilkinson, a linguist who is initially dismissive of Caraboo's story but has enough doubt to refuse to say she is a fraud.\n\nThe local society finds Princess Caraboo fascinating and they flock to attend parties and soirees with her. Mr. Gutch begins investigating people connected with the Magdalene House. Lady Apthorpe takes Caraboo to a ball held for the Prince Regent, who is fascinated by Caraboo. Gutch learns Caraboo is actually Mary Baker, who worked as a servant for Mrs. Peake. Gutch sneaks into the ball to warn her she's been found out, but she refuses to acknowledge what he tells her. Mrs. Peake comes and confronts Caraboo and identifies her as Mary Baker. She is locked up. The local magistrate and Mr. Worrall want to hang her. Mrs. Worrall gives Mr. Gutch documents implicating her husband and the magistrate in a bank fraud. Mr. Gutch uses these to work a trade. He will bury the story if Mary Baker can go to America. Gutch, who has fallen in love with Mary, leaves with her for the United States.\n\n\"Princess Caraboo\" received mixed reviews. It holds a rating of 63% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.\n\n"}

The term usually refers to a type of radio-frequency (RF) power amplifier, some of which have output power measured in kilowatts, and are used in amateur radio. Other types of linear amplifier are used in audio and laboratory equipment. Linearity refers to the ability of the amplifier to produce signals that are accurate copies of the input. A linear amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and tends not to generate harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion. No amplifier can provide perfect linearity however, because the amplifying devices—transistors or vacuum tubes—follow nonlinear power laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects. There are a number of amplifier classes providing various trade-offs between implementation cost, efficiency, and signal accuracy. \n\nLinearity refers to the ability of the amplifier to produce signals that are accurate copies of the input, generally at increased power levels. Load impedance, supply voltage, input base current, and power output capabilities can affect the efficiency of the amplifier.\n\nClass-A amplifiers can be designed to have good linearity in both \"single ended\" and \"push-pull\" topologies. Amplifiers of classes AB1, AB2 and B can be linear only when a tuned tank circuit is employed, or in the push-pull topology, in which two active elements (tubes, transistors) are used to amplify positive and negative parts of the RF cycle respectively. Class-C amplifiers are not linear in any topology.\n\nThere are a number of amplifier classes providing various trade-offs between implementation cost, efficiency, and signal accuracy. Their use in RF applications are listed briefly below:\n\n\nAlthough class-A power amplifiers (PA) are best in terms of linearity, their efficiency is rather poor as compared with other amplification classes such as “AB”, “C” and Doherty amplifiers. However, higher efficiency leads to higher nonlinearity and PA output will be distorted, often to extent that fails the system performance requirements. Therefore, class-AB power amplifiers or other variations are used with some suitable form of linearization schemes such as feedback, feedforward or analog or digital predistortion (DPD). In DPD power amplifier systems, the transfer characteristics of the amplifier are modeled by sampling the output of the PA and the inverse characteristics are calculated in a DSP processor. The digital baseband signal is multiplied by the inverse of PA nonlinear transfer characteristics, up-converted to RF frequencies and is applied to the PA input. With careful design of PA response, the DPD engines can correct the PA output distortion and achieve higher efficiencies.\n\nWith advances in digital signal processing techniques, digital predistortion (DPD) is now widely used for RF power amplifier subsystems. In order for a DPD to function properly the power amplifier characteristics need to be optimal and circuit techniques are available to optimize the PA performance.\n\nMost commercially manufactured one to two kilowatt linear amplifiers used in amateur radio still use vacuum tubes (valves) and can provide 10 to 20 times RF power amplification (10 to 13 dB). For example, a transmitter driving the input with 100 watts will be amplified to 2000 watts (2 kW) output to the antenna. Solid state linear amplifiers are more commonly in the 500 watt range and can be driven by as little as 25 watts.\n\nLarge vacuum-tube linear amplifiers generally rely on one or more vacuum tubes supplied by a very high voltage power supply to convert large amounts of electrical energy into radio frequency energy. Linear amplifiers need to operate with class-A or class-AB biasing, which makes them relatively inefficient. While class C has far higher efficiency, a class-C amplifier is not linear, and is only suitable for the amplification of constant envelope signals. Such signals include FM, FSK, MFSK, and CW (Morse code).\n\nThe output stages of professional AM radio broadcast transmitters of up to 50 kW need to be linear and are now usually constructed using solid state technologies. Large vacuum tubes are still used for international long, medium, and shortwave broadcast transmitters from 500 kW up to 2 MW.\n\n"}

It is the administrative center of the Chortkiv Raion (district), housing the district's local administration buildings.\n\nChortkiv is located in the northern part of the historic region of Galician Podolia on the banks of the Seret River.\n\nIn the past Chortkiv was the home of many Hasidic Jews; it was a notable shtetl and had a significant number of Jews residing there prior to the Holocaust. Today, Chortkiv is a regional commercial and small-scale manufacturing center. Among its architectural monuments is a fortress built in the 16th and 17th centuries as well as historic wooden churches of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe first historical mention of Chortkiv dates to 1522, when Polish King Sigismund I the Old granted an ownership order for Jerzy Czortkowski over the town and allowed him to name it after himself—\"Czortków\". The small community, numbering at 50 families, were almost all massacred during the Chmielnicki Uprisings of 1648–9. Jewish leadership opposed the resettlement of Jews in Chortkiv until 1705. During that time, the town was also granted Magdeburg rights. However, Chortkiv would later decline in the second half of the 17th century during Ottoman Expansion of central Europe. The town was taken over by Ottoman Empire, whose rule lasted 27 years. It was part of the short-lived Turkish Podolia Eyalet, which lasted from 1672 to 1699. During this period, it was nahiya centre in Yazlofça sanjak as \"Çortkuv\" (Spelled as \"Chortkoov\" in Turkish). After First Partition of Poland Chortkiv came under Austro-Hungarian rule which lasted from 1772 to 1918, during the time of which it was the center of the Chortkiv Bezirk except brief Russian rule between 1809 and 1815 as part of Tarnopol Governorate. On June 8, 1919 the Ukrainian Galician Army broke for couple months through the Polish front at Chortkiv and began the Chortkiv offensive. Soon afterwards, the town was seized by the Poles. It was ceded to sovereign Poland in the Peace Treaty of Riga between Poland, Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus) and Soviet Ukraine, and remained part of the Tarnopol Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic until the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939.\n\nIn 1931, the town had 19,000 inhabitants, 22.8 percent of whom were Ukrainians (Greek Catholics), 46.4 percent of whom were Poles (Roman Catholics), and 30 percent of whom were Jews. Chortkiv was an important garrison of the Polish Border Defence Corps Brigade \"Podole\", whose commandant from 1935 to 1938 was General Stefan Rowecki. Furthermore, it was home to the 36th Reserve Infantry Division.\n\nThe town was annexed to the Soviet Union from September 17, 1939 until June 1941. Its Polish inhabitants, particularly students of the local high school, organized a failed uprising in January 1940, which would serve as the first Polish uprising of World War II. From 1941-1944 it was annexed to Nazi Germany. After the defeat of the Nazis by the Red Army in 1944, the town returned to Soviet control until in 1991 it became part of independent Ukraine. Polish residents of the town were transferred to the Recovered Territories in the immediate postwar period (see Polish population transfers (1944–1946)).\n\nDue to heavy destruction of Ternopil, in 1944 Chortkiv served as a regional seat.\n\nIn January 1989 the population was 26 681 people.\n\nIn January 2013 the population was 29 640 people.\n\n\n\n8.

The typical Smalltalk \"five-pane\" browser is a series of horizontally-abutting selection panes positioned above an editing pane, the selection panes allow the user to specify first a category and then a class, and further to refine the selection to indicate a specific class- or instance-method the implementation of which is presented in the editing pane for inspection or modification.\n\nMost succeeding object-oriented languages differed from Smalltalk in that they were compiled and executed in a discrete runtime environment, rather than being dynamically integrated into a monolithic system like the early Smalltalk environments. Nevertheless, the concept of a table-like or graphic browser to navigate a class hierarchy caught on.\n\nWith the popularity of C++ starting in the late-1980s, modern IDEs added class browsers, at first to simply navigate class hierarchies, and later to aid in the creation of new classes. With the introduction of Java in the mid-1990s class browsers became an expected part of any graphic development environment.\n\nAll major development environments supply some manner of class browser, including\n\nModern class browsers fall into three general categories: the columnar browsers, the outline browsers, and the diagram browsers.\n\nContinuing the Smalltalk tradition, columnar browsers display the class hierarchy from left to right in a series of columns. Often the rightmost column is reserved for the instance methods or variables of the leaf class.\n\nSystems with roots in Microsoft Windows tend to use an outline-form browser, often with colorful (if cryptic) icons to denote classes and their attributes.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century class browsers began to morph into modeling tools, where programmers could not only visualize their class hierarchy as a diagram, but also add classes to their code by adding them to the diagram. Most of these visualization systems have been based on some form of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\n\nAs development environments add refactoring features, many of these features have been implemented in the class browser as well as in text editors. A refactoring browser can allow a programmer to move an instance variable from one class to another simply by dragging it in the graphic user interface, or to combine or separate classes using mouse gestures rather than a large number of text editor commands.\n\nAn early add-on for Digitalk Smalltalk was a logic browser for Prolog rules encapsulated as clauses within classes. More recent logic browsers have appeared as BackTalk and SOUL (Smalltalk Open Unification Language with LiCor, or library for code reasoning) for Squeak and VisualWorks Smalltalk. A logic browser provides an interface to Prolog implemented in Smalltalk (Lisp engines have often been implemented in Smalltalk). A comparable browser can be found in ILog rules and some OPS production systems. Visual Prolog and XPCE provide comparable rule browsing. In the case of SOUL, VisualWorks is provided with both a query browser and a clause browser; Backtalk provides a constraints browser. The comments of Alan Kay on the parallel of Smalltalk and Prolog emerged in the same timeframe but with very little cross-fertilization. The interest in XSB prolog for XUL and the migration of AMZI! prolog to the Eclipse IDE are current paths in logic browser evolution. Rules encapsulated in classes can be found in Logtalk and several OOP Prolog variants such as LPA Prolog, Visual Prolog and AMZI! as well as mainstream SICStus.\n\nOne variant of the Seaside web framework in Smalltalk permits a class browser to be opened at runtime in the running web browser: an edit to a method then takes immediate effect in the running web application. In the case of Vistascript (Vista Smalltalk) for Microsoft IE7, a right-click on the background opens a ClassHierarchyBrowser. This is somewhat like editing JavaScript prototypes in a web browser or Ruby, Groovy or Jython classes in an IDE running in a JVM.\n\n"}

He was a prolific composer of chansons in the middle of the 16th century, some of which were extremely popular and widely distributed.\n\nHe was probably born in St. Marcel, not far from Paris, though details of his early life are incomplete. He was a choirboy at the French royal court in 1506, and in 1517 was a singer for Louise of Savoy. From then until 1539 his name is absent from all records at the court, but other records suggest he may have been working as an actor during this time. By 1539 he was again at the French royal court, this time singing in the royal chapel itself; and within a few years he had established a reputation as one of the most noted composers of chansons in France, along with Claudin de Sermisy.\n\nHe went to Italy sometime in the early 1550s, and is known to have been \"maestro di cappella\" for the Ferrarese Este family at Siena, in 1554. By 1560 he had returned to Paris, though probably only briefly, for he came to settle a family estate, and by the next year he was in Italy again, this time in Rome. He disappears from the records at this point, and probably died in 1561 or shortly after, most likely in Italy.\n\nSandrin apparently only wrote secular music, and only chansons, although as is the case with many composers of the era there is always the possibility that much of his music was lost. All of his music is vocal, and all for four voices.\n\nStylistically, Sandrin's music resembles that of Claudin de Sermisy, the more famous composer of Parisian chansons, although Sandrin's blends Italian influences with the native French style. His chansons tend to be homophonic, with occasional contrapuntal detail, but the later ones employ many of the rhythmic devices common in Italian secular music of the period, particularly the frottola, and also are filled with madrigalisms such as word-painting.\n\nOne of his chansons, \"Doulce memoire\", became one of the most popular pieces of the entire 16th century, and exists in countless copies and arrangements in sources in many countries; it was a particular favorite of lutenists and keyboard players.\n\n\n\n"}

Yang grew up in Great Neck, New York and graduated from the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey in 1990. He then attended Columbia University, graduating in 1994. \n. Yang graduated with honors in political science/international relations from Columbia University.\n\nIn 1993, while a senior at Columbia, Yang was picked to star in the original Broadway production of \"Miss Saigon,\" where he went on to play the lead role of Thuy. He left the Miss Saigon company in 1995 to tour Asia in the title role of Aladdin in Cole Porter's \"Aladdin\". That same year, Yang was cast by the American opera director Peter Sellars' to play one of the leading roles in John Adams (composer) world premiere of \"I Was Looking At the Ceiling and then I Saw the Sky.\" The opera's world tour included stops at Lincoln Center, Cal Arts in Berkeley, the Edinburgh International Festival, Hamburg's Thalia Theater, the Helsinki Festival, and the Paris Festival. These performances were called \"dynamic\" by Time Magazine, \"passionate\" by The New York Times, and \"one of the most remarkable moments in recent operatic times\" by the Scotland Times. Yang returned to the New York stage in 1998 as Whizzer in NAATCO's non-traditional casting of William Finn's \"Falsettoland\". The production was lauded for its universal appeal and \"The New York Times\" added that \"it's Mr. Yang as the cocky, athletic Whizzer who delivers the most smashing performance. He's persuasive from start to finish as the boy toy who becomes a man in the arms of Marvin and the hospital bed he's confined to after developing AIDS.

In 2001, Yang also co-hosted the talk show \"Studio Y\" on MSG Metro Channels, where he interviewed celebrities that included Tina Fey, Ed McMahon, Leslie Bibb, and many others.\n\nIn 2005, Yang premiered the musical concert Finding Home, a show that paralleled the story of his parents to that of him and his then girlfriend Dina Morishita. The show premiered at UCLA’s Royce Hall and was presented by TUF. It was at the end of that sold-out concert that Yang surprised Morishita by proposing to her in front of the sold out audience. Finding Home later went on to play at Taiwan’s National Concert Hall and Vancouver’s Explorasian Festival in 2006.\n\nIn 1997, Yang founded Second Generation, a New York-based theater company dedicated to bringing Asian American stories to the world's stage. Under his artistic leadership, the company cultivated the works of many emerging playwrights, many of whom went on to receive productions throughout the country. The company also commissioned Yang along with co-writers Brian Yorkey and Woody Pak to write and develop the musicals \"Making Tracks\" and \"The Wedding Banquet\" (a musical adaptation of Ang Lee's Academy Award-winning film). \"Making Tracks\" first premiered in 1999 at the Taipei Theater in New York then went on to further development at Taiwan's National Theater in 2001, Seattle's Village Theater, in 2002, and San Jose Repertory Theater in 2004. \"The Wedding Banquet\" received its world premiere with productions in Singapore, Taiwan, and Seattle. in 2003.

Typically they are used in teaching very young children to ride a bike, although versions for adults exist.\n\nTraining wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, children learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that training wheels can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear wheel by training wheels that are too low. Adjusting training wheels correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Many modern kids' bikes, however, are not compatible with training wheels. Alternatives to using training wheels include removing the pedals from a child's bike, or balance bicycles. USA Cycling President Derek Bouchard-Hall stated in a Wall Street Journal article that balance bikes \"have made training wheels obsolete.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2217238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217238", "title": "Aircrew Badge", "text": "Aircrew Badge\n\nThe Aircrew Badge, commonly known as Wings, is a qualification badge of the United States military that is awarded by all five branches of armed services to personnel who serve as aircrew members on board military aircraft. The badge is intended to recognize the training and qualifications required by aircrew of military aircraft. In order to qualify as an aircrew member and receive the Aircrew Badge, such personnel typically undergo advanced training in aircraft in-flight support roles.\n\nThe first version of the Aircrew Badge was issued by the Army Air Forces during the Second World War. The badge was similar in design to the Aviator Badge, however, and displayed an emblem denoting enlisted status on its circular shield, or escutcheon, centered between two wings. The emblem featured the arms of the United States of America, in clear relief generally against a horizontally lined background, on a disk with a raised rim.\n\nAnyone trained in flight operations was authorized to wear this badge, including pilots, bombardiers, navigators, flight engineers, radio men and gunners. The badge was also awarded to certain ground personnel at the discretion of their commanding officer. Non-crewmembers eligible for the badge were individuals with flying status such as aircraft maintenance supervisors and technical inspectors. For example, aircrew badges were issued to Automatic Flight Control Equipment (A.F.C.E.) and Bombsight Shop personnel and others essential to \"keep 'em flying\" who flew instructional and maintenance flights but who did not actually take part in combat missions during World War II.\n\nWith the creation of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of service in 1947, the Army was left without an Aircrew Badge until the Korean War. At that time, to recognize the continued use of Army aviation, the Aircraft Crewman Badge was created. The badge was issued in three degrees: Basic, Senior, and Master. The level of seniority depended on the number of flight hours obtained and years of service in the United States Army.\n\nOn February 29, 2000, the Department of the Army officially changed the name of the Aircraft Crewman Badge to the Army Aviation Badge. The badge itself was not altered; however, the change was made retroactive to 1947, requiring updates to military records upon request from the military service member. This change essentially made army aircrew wings an \"MOS Badge\" awarded to all aviation MOS's, including non flying jobs such as Aviation Operations and Air Traffic Controllers. Thus, a crew chief who actually engages in aerial flight has no distinction from an air traffic controller because both are on flight status.\n\nAlthough the Army Aviation Badge is intended for enlisted personnel, in rare cases the decoration can be awarded to officers.\n\nFor non-rated Army members who qualify for the Astronaut Badge, but have not yet participated in a qualifying spaceflight, the Army Aviation Badge may be awarded with the astronaut device appearing on the central shield.\n\nThe Air Force Aircrew Badge is a direct successor to the Army Air Forces version of the decoration. Originally known simply as the \"Aircrew Badge\", the Air Force began issuing the decoration to enlisted Aircrew members in 1947. By the time of the Korean War, regulations had been established for a senior and master version of the badge, indicated by a star and wreath above the decoration. As with the Army Aviator Badge, seniority of the Aircrew Badge was determined by flight hours obtained and years of service in the Air Force.\n\nWith the decline of the Observer Badge, a need quickly arose to award an Aircrew Badge to officers who had been trained as in-flight support personnel. By the time of the Vietnam War, the Air Force had created an Officer Aircrew Badge which was issued to non-rated officers trained for in-flight operations. These badges began to lose a bit of value, as they became easier to obtain for Aircrew members, but was still considered extremely prestigious in regards to the Air Force. The enlisted version of the Aircrew Badge remained relatively the same and was now referred to as the Enlisted Aircrew Badge.\n\nIn the modern United States Air Force, the Enlisted Aircrew Badge is still issued to 1A0X1 (Inflight Refueling), 1A1X1 (Flight Engineer), 1A2X1 (Aircraft Loadmaster), 1A3X1 (Airborne Mission Systems Specialist), 1A4X1 (Airborne Operation Specialist)(now merged with 1A3X1), 1A6X1 (Flight Attendant), 1A8X1 (Airborne Cryptologic Language Analyst), 1A8X2 (Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) Operator), 1A9X1 (Special Missions Aviation), and X4N0X1 (Aeromedical Evacuation Specialist). Enlisted RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) Sensor Operators (1U0X1) were previously awarded their own aircrew wings, beginning in 2010. As of 28 Feb 2018, the Enlisted RPA wings are still authorized for wear.\n\nThe Officer Aircrew Badge is less often awarded, usually to Information Integration Officers (IIO), Airborne Intelligence Officers (AIO), Airborne Surveillance Officers (ASO), Flight Test Engineers (FTE), as well as selected communications and weather officers depending on assignment, such as Aerial Reconnaissance Weather Officers (ARWO). The single exception to this policy was an Air Force FTE who was subsequently selected as a NASA Mission Specialist Astronaut for the Space Shuttle program. Since there was no provision for the USAF Officer Aircrew Badge with the Astronaut \"shooting star\" symbol, the Air Force opted to award this officer the Senior Navigator (now Senior Combat Systems Officer) Badge with the Astronaut \"shooting star\" symbol following her first space flight, this despite her never having completed either the Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) or Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer (UCT) flight training syllabi. The rationale of the USAF leadership for doing so at the time was under a little used codicil that the Navigator / CSO insignia could also be awarded as an \"Air Force Observer\" Badge. The number of officers awarded the Aircrew Badge dropped considerably in 1999, when Air Battle Managers became a rated career field, and thus began being issued their own separate aviation badge.\n\nInitial award of the Officer and Enlisted Aircrew Badges occurs upon completion of training. Permanent award of the badges occurs upon 36 months of paid flying service or upon the completion of 10 combat missions. Award of the Senior Officer or Senior Enlisted Aircrew Badge occurs when all of the following criteria are met: 7 years aviation service, 1300 flight hours, and 72 months of paid flying service. Award of the Master Officer or Chief Enlisted Aircrew Badge occurs when all of the following criteria are met: 15 years aviation service, 2,300 flight hours, and 144 months of paid flying service.\n\nA Civil Air Patrol member who has qualified as a Mission Scanner, Aerial Digital Imaging System Operator, Airborne Photographer, ARCHER Operator, ARCHER Trac Technician, Geospatial Information Interoperability Exploitation Portable Operator, Surrogate Unmanned Aerial System Green Flag Sensor Operator, or Highbird Radio Operator is considered to hold the CAP Aircrew Rating and may wear the CAP Aircrew Badge.\n\nThe United States Navy, United States Marine Corps and United States Coast Guard issue the same version of the Aircrew Badge. The badge is a variation on the Naval Aviation Observer Badge with the letters AC centered on the badge's front.\n\nIn 2009, the Navy converted the badge from a qualification to a warfare designator like the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist (EAWS), Enlisted Submarine Warfare Specialist, and Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist (ESWS). The title was changed from Naval Aircrew (NAC) to Naval Aircrew Warfare Specialist (NAWS) and permitted USN Naval Aircrewman who also held the EAWS to place the Naval Aircrewman insignia in a senior position over their ribbons.\n\nKnown as Naval Aircrew Wings and Coast Guard Aircrew Wings, it is authorized for personnel who have undergone extensive training in flight operations of naval aircraft. Such training includes weapons management, electronic warfare, and water survival. Contrary to most other services, naval aircrewmen do not receive their wings after aircrew school. Rather, they receive (not awarded) their wings only after completing their platform respective Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) (roughly 1 year past the completion of training). Marine Crew Chiefs before Dec. 1971 were allowed to wear them, after 1971 the Marine Corp started awarding them to Crew Chiefs & all \nAircrewman.\n\nThe Naval and Coast Guard Aircrew Wings are issued in a single degree with no upgrade devices used or authorized. A Naval enlisted person who has qualified for his or her Naval Aircrew Badge places the initials \"NAC\" in parentheses after his or her rate and rating; for example, a Chief Cryptologic Technician Interpretive, after having qualified for their NAC Badge, is identified as a CTIC (NAC).\n\nMost Officer Aircrew members who are not Naval Aviators (i.e., pilots) are Naval Flight Officers and receive the Naval Flight Officer insignia after completion of a flight training syllabus nearly as long as that of their pilot counterparts. Certain naval officers (most notably selected intelligence and cryptology officers assigned to P-3 Orion, P-8 Poseidon, E-6 Mercury and EP-3E Aries II aircraft missions) can qualify for the Naval Aviation Observer Badge following completion of a structured Personnel Qualification Standard (PQS) syllabus and a check flight qualifying them for observer duties on that aircraft. The Marine Corps also previously used this badge for Aerial Observers in the since-retired OV-10 Bronco and OA-4M Skyhawk II until eventually inputting these officers into SNFO training and designating them as Naval Flight Officers. Unlike Naval Aviators, Naval Flight Officers and Naval Flight Surgeons, Naval Aviation Observers have not completed a formal undergraduate flight training syllabus under the auspices of the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) and are not considered to \nbe \"aeronautically designated\" officers in the Navy or Marine Corps. \nAircrew wings are issued almost exclusively to enlisted aviation ratings, with the exception of other sailors in other naval ratings who are assigned to aircrew billets, including but not limited to Cryptologists (CT), Information Technicians (IT), Intelligence Specialists (IS), and Hospital Corpsmen (HM). Former enlisted personnel who attain officer status are permitted to continue wear of the insignia. However, for the first three years of enlistment these wings are unobtainable due to recent changes in qualification requirements.\n\nDuring World War II, numerous fleet requests occurred to recognize the work of the enlisted aircrew members flying in combat, the result was the creation of the Air Crew Insignia on 18 May 1943. While primarily an enlisted insignia, officers were eligible if they met the same criteria of Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) Circular Letter 90-43. The design was essentially the same as today's insignia except all pewter silver with no gold. A subsequent BUPERS Circular Letter 395-44 dated 30 Dec 1944, changed the design to the same as today with the modification of the gold center disc. In 1958, the insignia was redesignated the \"Combat Aircrew Insignia\". In 1978, the Navy removed the insignia as authorized wear and then in 1994, the Marine Corps reestablished the insignia as it is known today as the Marine Combat Aircrew Badge. It is a decoration of the United States Marine Corps which is awarded to those enlisted personnel who have served as aircrew members on board combat flights. \n\nFor those who have participated in actual combat missions, gold service stars are worn pinned to the top of the decoration. MCO 1000.6G Para 3310.4 Upon earning more than three gold stars, silver stars are awarded in recognition of three gold stars, meaning three silver equates to nine gold plus the initial award of the combat aircrew device. MCO P1020 Para 4002.1F\n\nThe Marine Combat Aircrew Badge can be issued to service members of both the Marine Corps and United States Navy (while serving in a Marine Corps aviation squadron). Current regulations require a set number of combat 'points' to be earned before wear is authorized. It is not authorized to wear both the Combat Aircrew and Naval Aircrew pins at the same time. If an individual service member has been awarded both badges, they may decide which pin to wear on their uniform. A sailor who has qualified for the Combat Aircrew Badge and at least one gold star places the initials \"CAC\" in parentheses after their rate and rating; for example, a Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class (HM2), after having qualified for their CAC Badge, is identified as a HM2 (CAC).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2217241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217241", "title": "Voice of Peace", "text": "Voice of Peace\n\nVoice of Peace (, \"Kol HaShalom\") was an offshore radio station that broadcast in the Middle East for 20 years from the former Dutch cargo vessel \"MV Peace\" (formally \"MV Cito\"), anchored off the Israeli coast on East Mediterranean. Founded by Abie Nathan and the New York-based Peace Ship Foundation, the station broadcast almost continuously between 19 May 1973 and November 1993. The station was relaunched but solely as an online station in August 2009. A second online channel called The Voice of Peace Classics was added in 2014.\n\nThe aim of the Voice of Peace was to communicate peaceful co-existence to the volatile Middle East. The output was popular music presented by mostly British DJs broadcasting live from the ship. The main on-air studio consisted of a Gates Diplomat mixer, Technics SL-1200 turntables, Sony CD Players, and Gates NAB cartridge machines, on which the jingles and commercials were played. The second studio, for production, had a Gates turntable, reel-to-reel tape recorders, and an NAB cartridge recording unit.\n\nVoice of Peace was Israel's first offshore pop station and the first commercially funded private operation. The station’s American PAMS, CPMG, JAM, and TM Productions jingles, English-speaking DJs, and Top 40 hits attracted many advertisers. Initially, the station transmitted on 1539 AM (announced as 1540 AM) and in 1980 added a signal at 100.0 FM.\n\nNotable personalities were involved in broadcasting. The Carpenters, Johnny Mathis and others recorded messages of peace. John and Yoko Lennon signed hundreds of peace posters which Abie Nathan could sell in hard times. During the mid-1970s, the station boasted more than 20 million listeners from the Middle East to southern Europe and Turkey, thanks to the format used by professional broadcasters led by Keith Ashton.\n\nThe original AM/MW transmitter was installed in New York before 1972 and consisted of two 25,000-watt Collins units and a Collins combiner, giving the station a potential 50 kW AM signal. The MW signal was broadcast from a centre-fed horizontal antenna slung between the fore and aft masts, a design similar to those used by Radio Veronica and later Laser 558. The station normally ran at 35 kW until late 1976, when it was decided to operate just one transmitter at a time, keeping the other in reserve. In 1985, Keith York's repair of the combiner enabled the two Collins units to be run together again, resulting in a large mailbag from Turkey, Crete, Greece, and Cyprus, areas the Voice of Peace message hadn't reached for nine years. After these AM transmitters became unserviceable, a Canadian Nautel 10 kW AM transmitter was installed.\n\nA shortwave transmitter was used briefly on 6240 KHz but this was abandoned due to interference problems.\n\nThe 20 kW FM transmitter installed in Israel was manufactured by Harris. This, with the antenna array, delivered around 80 kW ERP (Effective Radiated Power) of stereo. A second 20 kW Harris FM transmitter was also installed on board the peace ship.\n\nPresenters with Voice of Peace included Tony Allan, Chris Phelan, Peter Quinn, Nathan Morley, Nigel Harris, and Grant Benson. Steve Greenberg, who became a Grammy-winning producer and president of Columbia Records, was another early-1980s broadcaster. Kenny Page was one of the longest-serving presenters, on board from the 1970s to the 1990s.\n\nThe Voice of Peace was primarily in English, but a small output included Hebrew, Arabic, and French. Several shows ran for nearly its entire life, including Twilight Time (daily at 18:00, using the Platters hit of the name as its theme), the Classical Music Programme (daily from 19:30), and Late Night Affair (00.00-03.00).\n\nThe telephone forum chaired by Abie Nathan called \"Kol Ha Lev\" (Voice of the Heart) and then \"Ma La'asot?\" (?מה לעשות, \"What to do?\") was the only uncensored direct public dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe Voice of Peace was tolerated by the Israeli Government, as Abie Nathan was a personality in the country; however, the IBA was alarmed at its popularity and set up a state-run pop service, Reshet Gimel, in May 1976. Nathan was imprisoned on several occasions for violating laws forbidding contact with enemy states and the PLO.\n\nNathan decided to intentionally sink the ship in international waters on November 28, 1993 after promises of a broadcast license and mooring in Jaffa port failed, and he closed the station due to heavy losses and following the signing of the Oslo peace accords, which he assumed was validation of the station's mission. On the final day, he instructed the presenters to play the Beatles non-stop. The presenters on the final day included Nathan Morley, Matthew French, Bill Sheldrake and Clive Sinclair.\n\nAbie Nathan had a stroke in 1997 that left him partially paralyzed. He died in Tel Aviv on 27 August 2008 at 81. On 10 June 2007 Tel Aviv-Yafo decided to post a plaque on the Tel-Aviv boardwalk at Gordon Beach, opposite where the Peace Ship had been anchored. This memorial plays recordings of Voice Of Peace, including the station callsign in Nathan's voice and an explanation in Hebrew and English.\n\nIsraeli radio station Radius 100 (on VoP's FM frequency) airs weekday tribute programs. The first hour is music in the format of Twilight Time. The second plays hits mostly from the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Presenters include Gil Katzir, Mike Brand, and Tim Shepherd.\nIn 2003, NMC Music released a CD called the Voice of Peace, featuring songs and jingles from the station. \"As the Sun Sets\", a film about Abie Nathan, soon followed, directed by Eytan Harris. Double CD compilations followed in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn August 2009, The Voice of Peace launched online streaming at 128 kbit/s. It returned on Saturday November 7, 2009 at 12.00 UTC at http://www.thevoiceofPeace.co.il\nBy Christmas 2009, it featured some live programmes, as well as syndicated shows. The Voice of Peace is programmed by Mark Hanna, who was a regular presenter during summer 1992. Alan Roberts, a former programme director who spent about a year with the station in 1976 and 1977, also presents evening programmes. In August 24, 2010, former DJ (1987) Richard Doran Ticho returned to the one-hour program, Spotlight. On August 16, 2010, former DJ (1985) Andy Cox returned to broadcast a live interactive show on Monday and a chart countdown on Saturdays. He also hosted \"Twilight Time\" for over a year. November 24, 2010 saw Rob Charles (1986) return all-time number ones on Wednesday. On February 5, 2011 D, John Macdonald did several joint broadcasts from PulseFM studios in Scotland. John also hosted his show 'Late Night Affair'. In 2012 Chris Phelan stepped back aboard, under his new radio name Chris Williams. Chris was an original 1990 peace ship DJ and currently presents a daily live lunchtime show.\nIn 2014, a second channel was added besides the mainstream Voice of Peace. While the main channel continues to offer a mix of contemporary music and oldies, the new 24-hour channel called The Voice of Peace Classic concentrates exclusively on oldies and classic hit songs.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217244", "title": "Entrance (liturgical)", "text": "Entrance (liturgical)\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, an entrance is a procession during which the clergy enter into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors. The origin of these entrances goes back to the early church, when the liturgical books and sacred vessels were kept in special storage rooms for safe keeping and the procession was necessary to bring these objects into the church when needed. Over the centuries, these processions have grown more elaborate, and nowadays are accompanied by incense, candles and liturgical fans. In the liturgical theology of the Orthodox Church, the angels are believed to enter with the clergy into the sanctuary, as evidenced by the prayers which accompany the various entrances.\n\nThe bishop has the right to enter and leave the altar (sanctuary) through the Holy Doors at any time, and is not restricted to the liturgical entrances, as the priest and deacon are.\n\nDuring the course of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), there are two entrances. Both of the Entrances, as well as the ritual of the Liturgy of Preparation, are viewed by liturgical scholars as later additions to the Liturgy, and may not have been used by Saints Basil the Great or John Chrysostom, the authors of the most commonly used forms of the Divine Liturgy.\n\nThe Little Entrance occurs during the portion of the service known as the Liturgy of the Catechumens, in preparation for the scriptural readings. The priest takes the Gospel Book from the Holy Table (altar), and hands it to the deacon (if there is no deacon, he carries the Gospel Book himself.) They go counterclockwise around the Holy Table and out the North Door of the Iconostasis, and come to stop in front of the Holy Doors, while the priest prays silently the Prayer of the Entrance:\n\nO Master, Lord our God, Who hast appointed in heaven ranks and hosts of Angels and Archangels for the ministry of Thy glory: Cause that with our entrance may enter also the holy Angels with us serving Thee, and with us glorifying Thy goodness. For unto Thee are due all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.\n\nThe deacon presents the Gospel Book for the priest to kiss (if the bishop is present, it is presented to him instead) The deacon then points to the Holy Doors with his orarion, and bowing says to the priest, \"Bless, Master, the holy entrance.\" The priest blesses with his hand and says, \"Blessed is the entrance of Thy holy ones, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.\" When the choir finishes singing the Third Antiphon (usually the Beatitudes), the deacon (or priest) lifts up the Gospel Book and says, \"Wisdom! Let us attend!\" (if it is a Great Feast of the Lord, he first says a special entrance verse, usually taken from the Psalms) The choir then sings the Entrance Hymn: \"Come let us worship and fall down before Christ! O Son of God, save us who sing to Thee: Alleluia!\" and the Troparia and Kontakia of the day. Meanwhile, the deacon and priest go in through the Holy Doors, the deacon replaces the Gospel Book on the Holy Table, and both he and the priest kiss the Holy Table. The priest silently says the Prayer of the Trisagion.\n\nThis entrance is quite elaborate when the bishop is present and a \"Hierarchical Divine Liturgy\" is being served, since it is at this time that the bishop himself also enters the sanctuary for the first time. Until that point he has been standing upon the episcopal kathedra (ambo) in the center of the church. Also, when a bishop is to be consecrated, the rite takes place at the Little Entrance. This is also the point in the Liturgy when the bishop will bestow ecclesiastical awards and honours.\n\nAfter the troparia and kontakia, the choir begins the Trisagion: \"Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us!\" The chanting of the Trisagion at the Little Entrance is said to have been miraculously revealed to St. Proclus, Patriarch of Constantinople (434 -447). On certain Great Feasts of the church year, the Trisagion is replaced by another hymn, taken from \"As many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ! Alleluia!\" On Feasts of the Cross, the Trisagion is replaced by the hymn, \"Before Thy Cross, we bow down in worship, O Master, and Thy holy Resurrection we glorify!\" During the Trisagion, or its alternate hymn, the priest and deacon go to the High Place (seats for the bishop and priests to the east of the Holy Table) to prepare for the reading of the Epistle and Gospel.\n\nThe Little Entrance symbolizes the Incarnation of Christ and his baptism in the Jordan River: the deacon representing John the Baptist, and the priest representing Christ. Because the first coming of Christ was in humility, the priest is instructed in the rubrics to make the entrance with his hands at his side.\n\nThe Great Entrance occurs at a later point during the Divine Liturgy, near the beginning of the Liturgy of the Faithful, when the Gifts (bread and wine) to be offered are carried from the Chapel of Prothesis (a table on the north side of the sanctuary sometimes occupying its own apse), to be placed on the Holy Table.\n\nThis entrance is made during the chanting of the Cherubic Hymn The Cherubikon that accompanies the Great Entrance was apparently added by the Emperor Justin II (565 - 578) However, the Divine Liturgies celebrated on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday have their own unique Cherubic Hymns.\n\nWhen the Choir begins the Cherubic Hymn, the deacon begins a censing of the sanctuary, iconostasis, clergy and faithful while the priest prays a long silent prayer known as the \"Prayer of the Cherubic Hymn\". After the prayer and the censing are finished, the priest and deacon make three metanias (bows) in front of the Holy Table, raise their hands, and say the Cherubic Hymn three times (the priest saying the first half and the deacon(s) saying the second half), each recitation followed by another metania. They then kiss the Holy Table, and bow to each other. The deacon goes behind the Holy Table to the Table of Oblation (\"Prothesis\") and the priest comes out of the Holy Doors to bow to the people, asking their forgiveness. He then goes to the prothesis, censes the offering, and places the Aër (a large veil which covers the diskos and chalice) on the deacon's left shoulder—if there is no deacon, he places the veil over his own back so that it makes a cape covering his shoulders—and gives the diskos (paten) to the deacon, while he carries the chalice. The deacon, still holding the censer, raises the diskos so that it is at the level of his brow. The procession forms with servers (acolytes) holding candles and (depending upon the jurisdiction) ceremonial fans.\n\nAs soon as the choir finishes the first half of the Cherubic Hymn the procession goes out the North Door, into the nave and halts in front of the Holy Doors. During the procession, the deacon and priest make a series of intercessions formulated according to local custom. During the last intercession, the priest blesses the faithful with the chalice. The choir sings, \"Amen.\" and chants the second half of the Cherubic Hymn, during which the clergy enter the sanctuary through the Holy Doors and place the gifts on the Holy Table. The priest removes the smaller veils from the diskos and chalice and censes the gifts, saying special prayers together with the deacon\n\nThe Great Entrance symbolizes the triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday.\n\nThere is also an Entrance made during Great Vespers (served on Sundays and feast days). This follows exactly the same format as the Little Entrance at Liturgy, except that the censer is carried instead of the Gospel Book, and the silent prayer said by the priest is different:\n\nIn the evening, and in the morning, and at noonday we praise Thee, we bless Thee, we give thanks unto Thee, and we pray unto Thee, O Lord of all: Direct Thou our prayer before Thee as incense, and incline not our hearts unto words or thoughts of wickedness: but deliver us from all who seek after our souls. For unto Thee, Lord, O Lord, lift we up our eyes, and in Thee have we trusted. Put us not to shame, O our God. For unto Thee are due all glory, honour and worship, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.\n\nIf there will be a reading from the Gospel during Vespers that day, as occurs during Holy Week or the Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, the deacon will carry the Gospel Book instead of the censer.\n\nThis entrance occurs during the singing of the \"dogmatikon\" that concludes the verses of \"Lord I have cried\" (Psalm 140 LXX, etc.) and immediately prior to the singing of \"O Gladsome Light\". This entrance is not performed during either Daily Vespers (the ordinary weekday celebration of Vespers) or Little Vespers (an abbreviated form of Vespers served before an All-Night Vigil).\n\nThe Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is celebrated on Wednesdays and Fridays during Great Lent and is a Vespers service combined with the distribution of Holy Communion that had been consecrated the previous Sunday. The Little Entrance here is the same entrance of Great Vespers; however, when a Gospel reading is prescribed (during Holy Week or on feast days), the Gospel Book is used instead of the censer. The Great Entrance is performed in absolute silence (rather than the choir singing, as at the normal Divine Liturgy). while all prostrate themselves. The reason for this is because the elements carried in the Great Entrance are not simply bread and wine (as at the normal Liturgy), but have already been Consecrated, and are believed to be the actual Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nDuring Bright Week—the week beginning on Pascha (Easter Sunday)—the Holy Doors remain open the entire week, and whenever the priest or deacon enter or leave the sanctuary during services they always do so through the Holy Doors. This is a practice that is unique to Bright Week. In Greek practice, the Paschal services of Bright Week are repeated on the Apodosis (\"leave-taking\") of Pascha—the day before Ascension—and so this practice will be repeated on this day also.\n"}

After its closure as a railway tunnel, it reopened as part of the John Forrest Heritage Trail, a rail trail.\n\nPrior to the construction of tunnels and the sinking of the Subiaco railway station in 1999, the Swan View Tunnel was the only tunnel on the Western Australian railway network.\n\nSwan View Tunnel was built on an alignment which replaced the original Eastern Railway passing through Smiths Mill, (now Glen Forrest), and Mundaring. The project to build the new line, including the Swan View Tunnel, was managed by the Engineer-in-Chief of the Western Australian Government Railways, C Y O'Connor.\n\nThe tunnel is 13 chains (858 ft, 262m) long.\n\nWork began in 1894, with the two bores meeting on 18 April 1895. The tunnel opened on 22 February 1896. The unstable nature of the jointed granite, along with clay seams, caused difficulties during construction of the tunnel. A masonry-lined face prevented rock falls, but reduced the inner diameter.\n\nThe deviation from the original railway line, and the tunnel in particular, was a \"significant technical feat for the time\"; Engineers Australia awarded the deviation an Engineering Heritage Marker as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\nThe tunnel's small diameter combined with the steep gradient (1:49) to cause smoke accumulation. Incidents involving near-asphyxiation of train crews started in 1896, and continued throughout the tunnel's operating life. The first serious incident of this nature was in 1903.\n\nThe tunnel's design was incompatible with the ASG class Garratt steam locomotives used by the Western Australian Government Railways in the 1940s. The subsequent Royal Commission into the ASG dealt with design of the locomotive, and the very dangerous clearances.\n\nThe worst accident in the tunnel was on 5 November 1942, when both drivers and firemen were asphyxiated by carbon monoxide, one driver dying, when a fully laden double-header train passed through the tunnel at walking pace. Further cases occurred in 1943 and 1944 on up trains.\n\nSubsequent industrial strikes, Royal Commission and union agitation for the locomotives' withdrawal was a significant issue in the 1940s.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1945, a signal cabin was located at Tunnel Junction, on the eastern end of the tunnel, for managing the transition from the tunnel's single line to the dual lines of the system.\n\nThe single line tunnel was considered unsafe for eastbound (climbing) trains, and a diversion was added on the northern side of the hill that the tunnel passed through.\n\nIt was known as the deviation, and due to rock instability included a fence of 16 wires to be used as a detector of rock falls. The diversion was completed on 25 November 1945.\n\nThe railway line through the tunnel was lifted after the closing of the older and steeper Eastern Railway and the opening of the Avon Valley diversion that opened in February 1966.\n\nAfter the 1960s, gates/doors were put at either end of the tunnel though these were later removed.\n\nThe tunnel remains intact and has reopened as part of the John Forrest Heritage Trail, part of the larger Railway Reserve Heritage Trail. During the 1990s, the government authority in which the tunnel land was vested, the Department of Environment & Conservation allowed a number of night time \"ghost walks\" in the tunnel as part of the Hills Forest programmes.\n\n"}

Elections were held in various districts between 20 June and 30 June 1888. This was the only general election, where the writs were issued to return on various days.\n\nPrior to 1888, members of the 1st Council of the Northwest Territories were elected in by-elections to supplement members appointed by the Government of Canada. In order to have an elected member, a constituency needed to be set up in an area with 1000 people. Others members were appointed. This created a patchwork of represented and unrepresented areas across the sprawling and sparse territory.\n\nTwenty-two members were elected in this election. Robert Brett was appointed government leader by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal. His official title was Chairman of the Lt. Governor's Advisory Council.\n\nThree judges were appointed to the legislative assembly to provide legal advice, but they were not able to vote. They represented the territory at large.\n\nVoters in this election cast their votes by telling the returning officer who they want to vote for. This system lasted until 1894 when a secret ballot was first used in a by-election in the Whitewood district.\n\nThree members were acclaimed, but the turnout cannot be established as no voters lists were in use. Candidates were all elected as part of a consensus government.\n\nThree Members were appointed by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal after the election. The purpose was to bring experience in procedure, protocol and amending and introducing legislation. The Legal Advisors held seats at large, were allowed to participate in debates and were paid a salary of $250.00.\n\nThe three members of the assembly who were appointed, already served as members of the Assembly previously.

It is one of the largest stations in the network, serving as a base for Queensland programming - many programs are broadcast across the ABC Local Radio network in regional and rural areas of Queensland when those stations are not carrying local programming.\n\nPast presenters have included David Curnow, Spencer Howson, Tim Cox, Madonna King, Peter Dick, Rod Henshaw, Andrew Carroll and Susan Mitchell.\n\nRadio broadcasting began in Brisbane in 1925 when the Government of Queensland commenced its own broadcasting operations with the callsign 4QG - 4 denoted the state of Queensland; QG stood for \"Queensland Government\". 4QG became a part of the ABC's radio network at its inception in 1932.\n\nThe ABC started a second Brisbane station on 7 January 1938, using the callsign 4QR. The new station carried national programming—the forerunner of Radio National—while 4QG aired mainly local content. On 28 July 1963, the two stations quietly switched schedules, with 4QR becoming the local outlet for Brisbane while 4QG picked up the national schedule. ABC officials wanted to minimise interruptions of regular programming by parliamentary sessions. 4QG now operates under the callsign \"4RN\", in common with all other Radio National services in Queensland.\n\nUntil December 2006, ABC Radio Brisbane's studios were located on Coronation Drive in the Brisbane inner-city suburb of Toowong (a location severely damaged by water in the 1974 Brisbane floods).\n\nA number of breast cancer cases at the ABC's Toowong studios led to the permanent evacuation of the entire site in December, 2006. 350 staff, from ABC television, radio and online, were relocated. For the next five years, the station broadcast from an office building in Lissner Street Toowong. In January 2012, 612 moved to a newly built facility in South Bank. The old site is set to eventually become a three tower residential complex. \n\nIn September 2006, ABC Radio Brisbane was \"host radio broadcaster\" for naturalist Steve Irwin's memorial service at Australia Zoo, Beerwah. Breakfast announcers Spencer Howson (from ABC Radio Brisbane) and John Stokes (from the ABC Sunshine Coast station) were chosen to host the broadcast, made available to radio stations around the world.\n\nThe ABC Brisbane Centre, which was designed by Richard Kirk and built by Leighton Contractors, opened in 2012.\n\nRadio 4QR commenced operation on 7 January 1938.\n\nAt commencement the station was owned by the Commonwealth of Australia and under the legislation of the day required no licence. The Postmaster-General's Department maintained the transmission system and the station's studios, while the Australian Broadcasting Commission (subsequently Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1 July 1983) created the programme content to be transmitted. A licence was issued for the first time in 1992 in accordance with the newly legislated Broadcasting Services Act.\n\nInitially it operated on a frequency of 940 kHz within the then current 10 kHz channel spacing plan. On 1 September 1948 the station changed frequency to 590 kHz to accord with a revised Australia / New Zealand 10 kHz channel spacing plan which involved many changes to Australian station frequencies, particularly those in Queensland and New South Wales. In 1972/1973 the 4QR frequency was changed slightly to 580 kHz. Finally, on 24 November 1978 the frequency was changed to 612 kHz to accord with the 9 kHz channel spacing plan which had been agreed by Australia at Geneva in 1975 (\"The 1975 Geneva Agreement\").\n\nStation 4QR has seen several power increases since its commencement, both to increase its coverage area and to ameliorate increasing levels of man-made radio noise and night-time skywave interference levels. Initial operation was at 500 Watts. Power was increased to 1 kW in 1942/1943 and again to 2 kW in 1944/1945 to support the many military personnel in Brisbane during World War II. Power was increased to 10 kW in 1948/1949 and finally to 50 kW in 1962/1963.\n\nAt the time of initial establishment Radio 4QR operated from a city location. For many years now Radio 4QR has shared (with Radio 4QG, now 4RN) a tall dual anti-fading guyed and sectionalised vertical radiator of 198 metres AGL with structural capacitative top hat located at Bald Hills on the northern outskirts of Brisbane. The mast is a very prominent feature visible from major highways in the vicinity. There is a shorter (81 metres AGL) vertical guyed radiator on the site which provides a standby capability during main antenna maintenance.\n\n\"Breakfast\" is heard on ABC Radio Brisbane each weekday between 5am and 7:45am, and features news, sports, weather forecasts, financial information, discussions about the day's news and live traffic reports. News bulletins are broadcast throughout the program on the half-hour from 5am until 7am concluding with the station's flagship 15-minute bulletin at 7:45am.\n\nThe program has won numerous ratings surveys in the Brisbane radio market throughout recent years.\n\nSpencer Howson presented the program for eleven years, from the beginning of 2006 and to the end of 2016. In November 2016, Howson announced he was stepping down from hosting the breakfast show.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that \"Queensland Country Hour\" presenter Craig Zonca would be the new host of the station's breakfast show commencing in 2017. In December 2017, ABC announced that Rebecca Levingston would join Craig Zonca to host breakfast from January 2018. \n\nIn yet another on-air shakeup, Rebecca Levingston claimed the coveted Mornings slot from January 2019, and Zonca was paired with Loretta Ryan, relegating Emma Griffiths to weekend mornings.\n\n\"Mornings\" is broadcast from 8:30am until 11:00am with the first 30 minutes devoted to the main news stories of the day. Prime ministers, premiers and other politicians will lobby to be interviewed in this first half hour. After 9:00am talkback callers are encouraged to contribute to the day's debate. \"Mornings\" has proved almost as controversial as the stories normally covered on the local current affairs show. Several people have presented the show over the years with their departure often making headlines.\n\nRecent presenters have been Steve Austin (2011-7), Madonna King (2006–11), Steve Austin (2004-5), Kirsten Macgregor (2003), Susan Mitchell (2002), Andrew Carroll (2000-1), Cathy Border (2000), John Barton, Carolyn Tucker (1998–99), Anna Reynolds and Rod Henshaw.\n\nIn 2002, the ABC was forced to apologise to Andrew Carroll and admit he was unfairly sacked. Carroll was taken off-air after commenting, during an interview with Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, that he would have to \"reconsider the terms of his contract\" (or similar). Carroll's story was featured on the ABC's own media watchdog program \"Media Watch\".\n\nIn October 2011, King announced that she would be leaving the station to spend more time with her children.\n\nIn December 2011, Steve Austin was announced as King's replacement.\n\nIn December 2017, ABC announced that the Breakfast show with Craig Zonca and Rebecca Levingston would extend to 10am and a new show Focus Brisbane with Emma Griffiths will replace the Morning show. In 2019, further changes saw the Focus program discontinued - and the Morning Show resumed with Rebecca Levingston as host.\n\nThe station's \"Afternoons\" program is broadcast on ABC Radio Brisbane between 12.30pm and 3.30pm and is presented by Katherine Feeney.\n\nBetween 12.30pm and 1.30pm the program is only heard on ABC Radio Brisbane and ABC Gold Coast. From 1.30pm to 3.00pm the program is statewide on the ABC Local Radio Queensland network. Between 3.00pm and 3.30pm the program is only heard on ABC Radio Brisbane.\n\nThe \"Drive\" program is heard between 3.30pm and 6:30pm and is presented by Steve Austin.\n\nA local \"Evenings\" program is heard from 7pm until 10pm Monday to Thursday and is simulcast on the regional ABC Local Radio Queensland network. Due to daylight saving time, the show is only broadcast from 7pm until 9pm during summer months.\n\nOn Fridays, a new national edition of \"Evenings\" hosted by Christine Anu is heard.\n\nFormer \"ABC News\" television presenter David Curnow was appointed host of \"Evenings\" in late 2013.\n\nHowever, in December 2017, ABC announced that Kelly Higgins-Devine would replace David Curnow from January 2018.\n\nA Saturday edition of \"Breakfast\" is broadcast between 6am and 7:45am each week with Emma Griffiths. The first hour of the program is dedicated to taking talk back calls with Gardening questions.\n\n\"Weekend Mornings\" is broadcast between 8:30am and 12pm on Saturdays and from 10am and 12pm on Sundays with Emma Griffiths. The program is simulcast on the ABC Local Radio Queensland regional network between 10am and midday on both days.\n\n"}

(, \"Thanks...\") is the fourth studio album by the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós, first released in America by Geffen Records on 12 September 2005. The album debuted at number 27 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 30,000 copies in its first week.\n\nUnlike its predecessor \"( )\", the album's lyrics are mostly in Icelandic, with occasional elements of \"Vonlenska\" (\"Hopelandic\"), a scat-like form of gibberish. The songs \"Andvari\", \"Gong\" and \"Mílanó\" are sung entirely in Vonlenska. Moreover, the song \"Mílanó\" was written together with the string quartet Amiina.\n\nRhythmically, \"Takk...\" makes extensive use of changing time signatures. In the track \"Andvari\" for example, the main melody repeats itself every 27 beats, with stress on beats 1, 5, 9, 11, 16, 20 and 25. This could be rendered as seven bars of 4, 4, 2, 5, 4, 5 and 3 beats respectively. Against this there is a steady counter-rhythm of triple time, which could be rendered as eighteen bars of 3/8 time per 27-beat cycle, also known as a phrase.\n\n\"Glósóli\" and \"Sæglópur\" were released on 15 and 16 August 2005 as the first and second singles respectively, the former worldwide and the latter only in the United States. \"Hoppípolla\" was released in the UK on 28 November 2005 as the third single.

The First Nation has a registered population of 1,828 people as of September 2014, of which approximately 623 members of the First Nation live on-reserve, and approximately 1204 live off-reserve. Muskoday's territory is located in the aspen parkland biome. It is bordered by the rural municipalities of Birch Hills No. 460 and Prince Albert No. 461.\n\nThe First Nation's land was settled after Chief John Smith of a Cree and Saulteaux band who were originally from the Saint Peter's Reserve (this was near Selkirk, Manitoba and was dissolved, with the remainder of the band today comprising the Peguis First Nation in Manitoba) settled along the South Saskatchewan River in the 1870s. Chief Smith signed onto Treaty Six at Fort Carlton in 1876 making the settlement legally an Indian reserve.\n\nThe reserve and First Nation was initially named after their Chief John Smith, who was a brother of Chief James Smith, the founder of the James Smith First Nation. Also during the late 19th century, James Isbister served for a period as a farm instructor at Muskoday.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the John Smith First Nation became the Muskoday First Nation. During the same period as the First Nation's name change, a highway was completed through the reserve that linked the town of Birch Hills with Prince Albert. The Muskoday Bridge was then built over the South Saskatchewan River, which divides the reserve lands roughly in half. The original band office was built in July 1978.\n\nUnlike many other Cree Nations in the area, in the 19th and 20th century the reserve was almost entirely Anglican, with no Roman Catholic influence. Traditional spirituality and practices remained strong, however. Today, the two church congregations serving the Muskoday First Nation are St. James Anglican Church and the Muskoday Baptist Church.\n\nThe Muskoday First Nation have an Act Electoral System for determining their elected leaders. The current leadership consists of Chief Austin Bear and five councillors: Herman Crain, Merle Crain, Elaine Ross, Randy Bear and Delbert Bear. Their two-year elected term began on March 20, 2017.\n\nThe First Nation is affiliated with the Saskatoon Tribal Council, along with six other First Nations. The Saskatoon Tribal Council was established on February 23, 1982, as an institution to assist the individual and collective governments of the First Nations in the Saskatoon area. In their mission statement, the Saskatoon Tribal Council states that they strive \"...to maintain the social, economic and political bases of the First Nations represented herein, including their rights to land, resources, culture, language, self-government and self-determination.\" The statement continues with \"The Saskatoon Tribal Council is desirous of obtaining and achieving co-operation and understanding between First Nation and non-First Nation citizens within represented First Nation territories and with Canada generally.\"\n\nMuskoday First Nation government have several services made available to their peoples. In 1997 the First Nation designed a Land Code to manage its own lands, rather than have them managed by the federal Government of Canada. This led the way for further developing services available to its people. These services include a housing development affectionately known as \"the village\" by the community, water plant, community health center, administration building and band hall.\n\nIn 2005, the Muskoday First Nation completed the construction of its own Kindergarten to Grade 9 school. Other services include the Muskoday Awasis Daycare/Headstart Center, Muskoday Volunteer Fire Department and the Muskoday Development Corporation.\n\nIn addition to these government services, the community houses a gas bar, a convenience store, and a post office.\n\nThe First Nation has reserved for itself the 9,686.8 hectare (23,936.6 acres) Muskoday First Nation Reserve (formerly the Muskoday 99 Indian Reserve), an Indian Reserve located approximately 19 km southeast of the city of Prince Albert. The community of the Muskoday First Nation, is located on this reserve at the following coordinates ().\n\nLike many of the First Nations of Canada, Muskoday First Nation are engaged in ongoing discussions, agreements and lobby efforts with the federal Government of Canada; Land ownership and entitlement are at the core in these efforts. At the time of the signing of Treaty 6, the incorrect amount of land was reserved for the Muskoday. This led to Muskoday First Nation to submit a Treaty Land Entitlement (TLE) claim. The discrepancy was identified as 6,144 acres (2,486.4 hectare). The TLE claim was approved and on May 23, 2007, Muskoday members voted overwhelmingly to ratify the TLE settlement. The amount of the TLE will be approximately $10,300,000.00, which will be paid to Muskoday over a period of 5 years. To satisfy the conditions of the TLE claim process, Muskoday must purchase at least during that 5-year period.\n\n"}

The pilot originally aired on 3 January 1988, and the first series of episodes followed on 4 September 1988. The show ran for two series of six episodes each, with the final episode airing on 8 October 1989. The pilot episode was produced and directed by Gareth Gwenlan. Both series of episodes were produced and directed by Mike Stephens. The BBC has never shown repeats of the show, although repeats do occasionally appear in the UK on satellite station Gold. The show was broadcast in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation network in the early 1990s.\n\n\"First of the Summer Wine\" was a prequel to Clarke's long running show, \"Last of the Summer Wine\", portraying the youth of the principal characters from the mother show in the months leading up to World War II. With the possibility of war hanging over them, the young men and women enjoy their youth while trying to find a place for themselves in the world. The show used young, mostly unknown actors to play the characters, with only two actors from the original series making an appearance in the prequel.\n\nWith the success of \"Last of the Summer Wine\", the BBC approved a new series which Roy Clarke would carry over characters of the original show. With the new series, Clarke hoped to show the lives of his characters as they were in the \"first summer\" of their lives, as opposed to the last summer depicted in \"Last of the Summer Wine\". While there would still be the \"shadow of the Grim Reaper\" hanging over them, this time it would be because of World War II, not due to their old age.\n\nFor the new series, Clarke used mostly young, inexperienced actors to fill the roles of the characters carried over from the original series. The actors were required to mimic the vocal characteristics and mannerisms already established in \"Last of the Summer Wine\" to create a continuity between the two series.\n\nThe show features much 1920s and 1930s music, which adds to the nostalgic feel of the show. The theme tune is \"Sweet and Lovely\", sung by Al Bowlly, accompanied by Roy Fox and his Band. The recording was made in London on 18 September 1931.\n\n\"First of the Summer Wine\" followed a group of young men and women, some of whom were adapted from \"Last of the Summer Wine\", with others being specifically created for the new show. The men consisted of Paul Wyett as the scruffy and immature Compo Simmonite; David Fenwick as meek and deep-thinking Norman Clegg; Paul McLain as snobbish ladder-climber Seymour Utterthwaite; Richard Lumsden as the eager soldier Foggy Dewhurst; Gary Whitaker as the love-smitten Wally Batty; and Paul Oldham as their friend, Sherbert. The women consisted of Helen Patrick as the object of Wally's affections, Nora Renshaw; Sarah Dangerfield as Ivy; Joanne Heywood as Dilys, Judy Flynn as Lena, and Linda Davidson as Anita Pillsworth.\n\nThe adults around the young people act as supporting characters. Peter Sallis and Maggie Ollerenshaw play David and Violet Clegg, Norman's parents. Derek Benfield portrays Mr Scrimshaw, the manager of the shop where Ivy, Dilys, Sherbert, Norman and Seymour work.\n\n\"First of the Summer Wine\" takes place between May and September 1939, in the months leading up to World War II. The series revolves around the diary entries of the young Norman Clegg. Each episode begins with him resting on his bedroom windowsill and greeting the day; the words \"the diary of Norman Clegg, aged 18 years\" introduce the theme of each episode.\n\nEpisodes revolve around the antics of the young men of a small Yorkshire village and their usually level-headed female counterparts, all of whom are grappling with the world around them, their youth, and their experiences with the opposite sex. With rumblings of war on the European continent as Hitler’s Nazi Germany and Great Britain become increasingly poised for war, the lives of the young men and women will be changed forever.\n\nThe scenario uses retroactive continuity. In \"Last of the Summer Wine\", Seymour is introduced in later series, and is initially unknown to the other central characters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217321", "title": "Section 25 (band)", "text": "Section 25 (band)\n\nSection 25 are an English post-punk and electronic band, best known for the single \"Looking From A Hilltop\", with two different music videos, and their association with Manchester record label Factory Records.\n\nSection 25 formed in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool, Lancashire, in November 1977. Initially the band was a duo, consisting of brothers Larry Cassidy (bass, vocals) and Vincent Cassidy (drums). In June 1978 they made their live debut with Phil Denton on guitar. Denton was replaced in November by Paul Wiggin. June 1979 saw the Cassidy brothers promote a charity gig in aid of International Year of the Child at Blackpool Imperial Hotel, featuring Section 25 and other local bands as well as Joy Division and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. As a result, Section 25 were invited to play at the Russell Club in Manchester, and joined Factory Records.\n\nTheir debut 7\", \"Girls Don't Count\", was released in July 1980 on Factory Records, produced by Ian Curtis and Rob Gretton of Joy Division. All Section 25 releases would be released through either Factory Records (until the demise of that label), or sister imprint Factory Benelux. Their debut LP, \"Always Now\", appeared in 1981 and was produced by Martin Hannett at Britannia Row studio. The pochette sleeve was among the most expensive and elaborate in the label's history (designed by Peter Saville) utilising an exclusive 'marble' effect design printed on the inner jacket and a fold-out cover that resembled a match-book similar to the cover used by Cabaret Voltaire for their \"2x45\" album.\n\nThe three-piece group played many gigs in Britain and Northern Europe between 1979 and 1981, both as a headline act and with other Factory Records artists, such as Joy Division, A Certain Ratio, Blurt, The Durutti Column, Crispy Ambulance and New Order. The group also released a self-produced second album, \"The Key of Dreams\". However the original line-up split in September 1981 shortly after Paul Wiggin declined to fly to a concert in Helsinki supporting New Order, swallowing up most of their fee by travelling overland. With a North American tour already planned, his fear of flying made his departure inevitable. Factory label boss Tony Wilson then tried and failed to recruit then-unknown guitarist Johnny Marr as a replacement.\n\nAbandoning much of the existing live set, the Cassidy brothers prepared for an upcoming European tour with backing tapes and an extra percussionist John Grice. Following a warm-up date in London, the group visited Belgium, Holland and Germany in January 1982 in tandem with Factory labelmates Crispy Ambulance. The band then undertook their first North American tour, albeit restricted to the East Coast.\n\nJoined by percussionist Lee Shallcross, Section 25 gradually evolved with a more electronic-dance direction, a process which culminated in the album \"From the Hip\" and remix single \"Looking From A Hilltop\", both released in 1984 and produced by Bernard Sumner of New Order. This second iteration of the band also featured the Cassidy brothers' sister Angela Flowers (vocals, keyboards) and Larry Cassidy's wife Jenny Ross (vocals, keyboards). The five-piece completed a lengthy second tour of North America in January 1985, where the single \"Looking From A Hilltop\" achieved a measure of club success.\n\nLater in 1985 the single \"Crazy Wisdom\" emerged on Factory Benelux as a 12\", but the group again splintered, leaving husband-and-wife team Larry Cassidy and Jenny Ross to complete a fourth album, \"Love & Hate\", finally released by Factory in 1988. \"Bad News Week\" was also released as a 12\" single, remixed by Bernard Sumner. Section 25 then fell silent for more than a decade, although their entire back catalogue was reissued on CD on LTM as well as an archive DVD, \"So Far\". There have also been several live and rarity CDs released by the same label.\n\nIn 2001 the band regrouped and started composing new material. It was originally expected that this would form the basis for a new album, but these plans were derailed when Jenny Ross, after a long fight with cancer, died on 20 November 2004 at age 42. The LTM DVD \"So Far\", an audio-visual history of the band released in January 2005, was dedicated to her memory.\n\nNow with Ian Butterworth (formerly of fellow Factory act Tunnelvison) on guitar and Roger Wikeley on bass and keyboards, the Cassidy brothers performed their first live show in nearly two decades at their hometown Poulton-Le-Fylde in May 2006 followed by dates in Blackpool, Paris, Brussels, Leicester, London and Athens.\n\nA new studio album by the quartet, \"Part-Primitiv\", was released by LTM in April 2007, together with Communicants, a DVD assembled from live performances in 2006. Larry and Vin Cassidy also featured in the 2006 Factory documentary film \"Shadowplayers\", and a BBC television documentary on the label. The group performed at the Plan K venue in Brussels in December 2007 as part of the Factory Night (Once Again) event, being joined onstage by Peter Hook of New Order for a cover of \"Temptation\". It was then proposed that Hook and Section 25 play further shows together, performing a mixture of Section 25, Joy Division and New Order songs.\n\nRoger Wikeley left Section 25 in 2008 and was replaced by Stephen Stringer. In November this revised line-up played with Peter Hook in Paris, Brussels, Oss in the southern Netherlands and Krefeld in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Ian Butterworth parted company with the Section 25 at the end of the year. Stephen Stringer moved on to guitar and Section 25's sound engineer and programmer Stuart Hill moved on to bass guitar. Both were no strangers to Larry and Vin, who had helped them record demos in 1983 and 1985.\n\nThe band released a new album in 2009 called \"Nature + Degree\" through LTM Recordings. Several tracks featured vocals by Bethany Cassidy, daughter of Larry and Jenny, who joined the group as co-vocalist and keyboards player. Section 25 appeared at the \"Factory Night (And Then Again)\" event at Plan K on 12 December 2009, with Beth and Larry sharing vocals. The group also returned to the States for festival dates in Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nOn 27 February 2010, it was announced that founding member, singer, and bass player for the group, Larry Cassidy, had died at the age of 56.\nPrior to Larry Cassidy's death, the band had completed work on a new album, \"Retrofit\", which was released on 14 September 2010. The album features electro reworkings and updates of previously issued Section 25 tracks, as well as one new song \"Über Hymn\". The album closes with a new version of \"Looking From A Hilltop\", produced and arranged by Stephen Morris of New Order.\n\nLimited copies came with an extra CD of a 16-minute recording of Larry Cassidy reading selected lyrics of Joy Division's Ian Curtis. This was recorded in January 2010 and would be Larry's last visit to a recording studio.\n\nThe band opted to continue to perform with their current line up. Section 25 played the FAC251 club in Manchester on 20 November 2010, and in 2011 issued their first new release without Larry Cassidy, a download-only EP titled \"Invicta\" EP, via Hacienda Records. June 2012 saw a deluxe vinyl reissue of \"From the Hip\" (Fact 90), issued as a special edition on Factory Records with 'remixed' artwork by Peter Saville, as well as a split coloured-vinyl 12\" with Stereograph featuring two dub versions of \"Colour Movement Sex and Violence\" and \"Inner Drive\".\n\nSaville also provided the cover image and title for their eighth studio album, \"Dark Light\", issued on the Factory Benelux imprint in February 2013. \"My Outrage\" was also released as a 7\" single. Also released during the same period were the 10\" single \"Invicta Max\" (an expansion of the 2011 EP of the same name) and the official remix album \"Eigengrau\", featuring numerous remixes of earlier Section 25 recordings by Zoviet France, Absolute Body Control, Portion Control and Renaldo and the Loaf among others.\n\nIn May 2014, the group issued an expanded 30th anniversary CD edition of \"From the Hip\" via Factory Benelux, with a bonus disc featuring original demos as well as a BBC radio session from 1984 plus a new recording of \"Reflection\". Both Bernard Sumner and Jon Savage contributed liner notes. The new version of \"Reflection\" (subtitled 'Younger Image') was also issued as a limited edition orange vinyl 7\" single to mark Record Store Day in April 2014. On Record Store Day the band performed in Manchester with Factory peers Crispy Ambulance and Minny Pops. A review of the show in \"The Guardian\" described Section 25 as \"a revelation\" and \"the best new/old band in Britain.\"\n\nIn April 2015, Section 25 released \"Mirror\", another limited edition 7\" single for Record Store Day, with guest vocals by Simon Topping, formerly of A Certain Ratio. The song dated from 1980 but had never before been recorded in the studio. Both the song and the packaging complemented a new CD edition of \"Always Now\", re-mastered and featuring a bonus disc with their 1981 John Peel radio session as well as a complete live concert from 1980. The packaging replicated the original wraparound cover designed by Peter Saville.\n\nIn 2016, the group released a new live album, \"Alfresco\", as a vinyl and CD package to mark Record Store Day in April. That same year the track \"Hit\" from their 1981 album \"Always Now\" was sampled by Kanye West on a new song, \"FML\", featured on his seventh studio album, \"The Life of Pablo\".\n\nIn December 2017, the band announced on their Facebook page that they were working on a new album, to be released during the spring 2018. Vincent Cassidy also announced that their original guitarist, Paul Wiggin, will contribute on the new album. June 2018 saw the release of an eleven-track album, \"Elektra\", recorded at West Orange Studios during the early part of the same year. The album featured appearances by original guitarist Paul Wiggin and newest family member Michael Cassidy on bass. One of the tracks, \"FML\", is an acoustic cover of the Kanye West track that sampled the band's hit from their 1981 set \"Always Now\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2217336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217336", "title": "Pelagonia", "text": "Pelagonia\n\nPelagonia (Macedonian: Пелагонија, \"Pelagonija\"; Greek: Πελαγονíα, \"Pelagonía\") is a geographical region of Macedonia named after the ancient kingdom. Ancient Pelagonia roughly corresponded to the present day municipalities of Prilep, Mogila, Novaci, Kruševo, and Krivogaštani in North Macedonia.\n\nIn antiquity, Pelagonia was roughly bounded by Paeonia to the north and east, Lynkestis and Almopia to the south and Illyria to the west; and was inhabited by the Pelagones, an ancient Greek tribe of Upper Macedonia, who were centered at the Pelagonian plain and, according to Hecataeus (1 FGrH 107) and Strabo, were an Epirote Molossian tribe. The region was annexed to the Macedonian kingdom during the 4th century BC and became one of its administrative provinces. In medieval times, when the names of Lynkestis and Orestis had become obsolete, Pelagonia acquired a broader meaning. This is why the Battle of Pelagonia (1259) between Byzantines and Latins includes also the current Kastoria regional unit and ancient Orestis.\n\nStrabo calls Pelagonia by the name \"Tripolitis\" and names only one ancient city of the supposed three in the region; Azorus. Two notable Pelagonians include the mythological Pelagon, the eponym of the region, who, according to Greek mythology, was son of the river-god Axius (modern Axios or Vardar river) and father of the Paeonian Asteropaeus in Homer's \"Iliad\". The second one is Menelaus of Pelagonia (ca. 360 BC) who, according to Bosworth, fled his kingdom when it was annexed by Philip II, finding refuge and citizenship in Athens.\n\nToday, Pelagonia is a plain shared between North Macedonia and the Greek region of Macedonia. It incorporates the southern cities of Bitola and Prilep in North Macedonia and the northwestern city of Florina in Greece; it is also the location of Medžitlija-Niki, a key border crossing between the two countries. Many Mycenaean objects have been found in the area, such as the double axe, later found in Mycenae and are exhibited in the Museum of Bitola.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2217343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217343", "title": "State ratifying conventions", "text": "State ratifying conventions\n\nState ratifying conventions are one of the two methods established by Article V of the United States Constitution for \"ratifying\" proposed constitutional amendments. The only amendment that has been ratified through this method thus far is the 21st Amendment.\n\nArticle V reads in pertinent part (italics added):\n\nRatification of a proposed amendment has been done by state conventions only once—the 1933 ratification process of the 21st Amendment. The 21st is also the only constitutional amendment that repealed another one, that being the 18th Amendment, which had been ratified 14 years earlier.\n\nAs is true for a state \"legislature\" when ratifying a proposed federal constitutional amendment, a state ratifying \"convention\" may not in any way change a proposed constitutional amendment, but must accept or reject the proposed amendment as written.\n\nThe convention method of ratification described in Article V is an alternate route to considering the pro and con arguments of a particular proposed amendment, as the framers of the Constitution wanted a means of sometimes bypassing the state legislatures in the ratification process.\n\nTo some extent, the convention method of ratification loosely approximates a one-state, one-vote national referendum on a specific proposed federal constitutional amendment, thus allowing the sentiments of registered voters to be somewhat more directly felt on highly sensitive issues. The theory is that the delegates of the conventions—who presumably would themselves be average citizens—might be less likely to bow to political pressure to accept or to reject a given amendment than would be the case with state legislators. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a popular referendum is not a substitute for either the legislature or a ratifying convention—nor can a referendum approve of, or disapprove of, a state legislature's, or a convention's, decision on an amendment (\"Hawke v. Smith\", 253 U.S. 221, [1920]). This ruling was challenged under Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, in which the United States Supreme Court defined the term \"legislature\" broadly to include, \"the power that makes laws\", which the court held included direct lawmaking by the people of the state . The majority opinion stated that the Article V use of the term \"legislature\" applied only to the representative body of the states as a \"federal\" function, as opposed to a \"state\" function of the legislature as prescribed in . This conflict over the interpretation of the word \"legislature\" creates potential constitutional questions over the role that popular referendums could play in state ratifying conventions.\n\nNew Mexico law provides that the members of its legislature would themselves be the delegates and form such a ratifying convention—if Congress were to again select that particular method of ratification. The issue having never come before the federal courts, it is unknown whether this New Mexico state law violates Article V.\n\nIn a state's legislature, the ratification method is procedurally simple—merely propose a resolution, memorial, or proclamation of ratification and vote it up or down in each chamber of that state legislature. But using the convention method of ratification is a bit more complicated because it is, by necessity, separate and different from a state legislature. As early as the 1930s, state lawmakers enacted laws to prepare for the possibility of Congress specifying the convention method of ratification. Many laws refer to a one-off event, with an ad-hoc convention convened solely for the purposes of the 21st amendment. Other laws, however, provided guidelines for ratifying conventions in general.\n\nOnce Congress has proposed a federal constitutional amendment which Congress specifies is to be ratified by the convention method, Vermont's governor has 60 days to call for an election of delegates to that convention, and the setting of a date for those elections. Note that the Vermont code does not contemplate the calling of ratifying conventions from a national amendment convention, though the same procedures would likely be followed.\n\nFourteen persons are elected to be members of the ratifying convention. Those 14 would be elected statewide, meaning that each voter would cast votes for fourteen people, with the top fourteen vote-getters being elected. The election must take place from three to twelve months after the governor's call. The convention must begin 20 to 30 days after the election. The convention itself is held in the Senate chamber in the state capital.\n\nThe candidates who are seeking to become delegates are selected from a list of 28 possible Vermont citizens. All 28 candidates are selected by the governor, lieutenant governor, and speaker of the house. The persons selected must agree to be placed on the ballot - 14 of whom are opposed to ratification, 14 of whom are in favor. The ballots are to be plainly marked so that voters can decide based on the candidate's stand on the issue, or on name recognition. The state has 14 counties - each county is to have one \"pro\" and one \"con\" candidate. Voters can vote for all \"For\" or all \"Against,\" or any combination thereof.\n\nThe elected delegates meet on the appointed date, with the majority of those elected being a quorum. The Vermont code does not detail how the convention is to conduct its business aside from the fact that there will be a chairman and that the secretary of state will be the secretary of the convention, and those two persons will certify the results of the convention's vote. The convention might only last 15 minutes, or it could drag out for several days for debate. However long the convention takes, delegates are provided a stipend of $10.00 and reimbursement of actual expenses.\n\nIn Florida, the convention is made up of 67 members. The governor has 45 days to call an election to be held from five to ten months after Congress proposes the constitutional amendment. Anyone can apply to be a member of the convention, with the state qualifications for the Florida House of Representatives used as an eligibility test. Candidates can officially declare that they are \"for\" or \"against\" the proposed amendment, or they may apply as unannounced. An application fee of $25 and a 500-name petition are also required. On the ballots, candidates are listed in three categories: \"for\", \"against\", and \"undecided\". There is also provision for write-in candidates. The vote is at-large, meaning that the 67 top vote-getters statewide win the 67 seats in the convention. The convention begins on the second Tuesday following the election. Delegates are not compensated per diem or for expenses.\n\nThe procedure in New Mexico is vastly different. To start, the governor has only 10 days to call a convention—with each sitting member of the New Mexico Legislature automatically a delegate to the convention. Therefore, no special election is ever called for determining delegates. The convention is held in the chamber of the House of Representatives. New Mexico's code provides that, after three days, compensation to delegates will end.\n"}

It stars Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz. The film is one of Tom Petty's few movie soundtracks, and is named after the Bruce Springsteen song of the same name.\n\nIrish Catholic Mickey Fitzpatrick is a New York City taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather, his ex-fiancée. His brother, Francis, is a Wall Street stock investor married to Renee, though she is frustrated by his lack of desire for sexual relations – not knowing that he is in a heated affair with Heather.\n\nDuring weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents' home on Long Island. Their father, Frank, is locked in old-school, low-key, sexist ways, and is always telling Mickey and Francis what to do, yet also advises them to always go for what drives them to succeed.\n\nDriving his cab, Mickey picks up Hope, an NYU art student headed to the airport. They click within seconds and she asks him to drive her to New Orleans. They become infatuated and impulsively marry the next day, returning to New York two days later to tell Francis and Renee. Francis is upset, mostly because he was not asked to be best man. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with her bohemian lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis grows concerned that he is being unfair to Heather by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly, suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she asks Mickey and Frank to confront him. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful.\n\nFrancis belittles Mickey for the lack of forward progress in his life with Hope. Francis also argues with Heather about her ongoing sexual relations with a wealthy old man referred to as \"Papa\". When Mickey picks up Heather as a fare, he goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him during their relationship. When she implies that he wants more than the TV from her, he does not reciprocate, instead chastizing her for the infidelity that ended their engagement and for her time as a call girl to pay her way through college. Throughout all this, Frank offers more egotistical advice to them—only to be devastated when he learns, during a fishing trip with his priest, that his usually religious wife has not been to Mass in months.\n\nOn a visit to Heather's apartment, Francis learns about her meeting with Mickey. Francis shows up at his brother's apartment to question him about whether or not Mickey had sex with her. Later, Mickey discovers that she is the woman with whom Francis is having the affair. The revelation escalates to an argument at their parents' home, leading Frank to strap boxing gloves on them, with Mickey winning on the first punch.\n\nFrancis finally confronts Renee with his affair and files for divorce. When Mickey finds out he intends to marry Heather, he informs Francis of Heather's time as a prostitute, causing Francis to get cold feet.\n\nHope informs Mickey that they will need to move to Paris in a month if she is accepted into an art school there. Mickey is already unsure about whether to leave New York and join her when he meets Connie, Hope's co-worker at a neighborhood bar, who claims to have had a \"special relationship\" with Hope before the marriage (strongly implying a lesbian romance). Mickey reacts poorly, leading Hope to tell him that she is unsure if he should come to Paris with her after all.\n\nDue to Francis' sudden indecision over marriage, Heather decides to marry Papa. When Francis threatens to tell Papa that Heather was a prostitute, Heather tells Francis that Papa was \"her best customer\". He then calls Renee in hopes of getting back together with her, but she is already in a relationship with Scott Sherman, a family acquaintance whom Francis previously observed was a fatso geek, while Renee had pointed out that he was shy and sweet and nicer than Francis.\n\nMickey and Francis meet with Frank at his house, where their distraught father tells them that their mother left him the previous day for a hardware store owner with whom she has been sleeping when supposedly at church. Frank apologizes to Mickey and Francis for giving them bad advice about life and love when his own wife was cheating. The three men decide to go out fishing, aware that despite the failure of their love lives, they will always have each other. As they prepare the motorboat to cast off, Mickey realizes he must try to talk with Hope before she leaves for Paris. Mickey is surprised to learn that Frank has arranged a special guest – Hope. Hope asks to drive the boat, but Frank, who never allowed a woman on his boat before, says it is too soon for that.\n\nCritical reception of the film was mixed. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 61% based on reviews from 51 critics, with an average rating of 5.8/10. Critics were, overall, won by the performances of John Mahoney, Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz: Aniston and Mahoney brought a \"kind of solid professionalism\" according to Janet Maslin and Lisa Schwarzbaum. Chris Hicks said, \"Better, however, are Diaz, lending charm to a character who could have been quite unsympathetic, and especially Aniston, whose decent, trusting character is quite appealing. Best of all, however, is John Mahoney, hilarious as the bombastic patriarch of the Fitzpatrick clan, who refers to his sons as 'sisters' and calls them 'Barbara' or 'Dorothy' while offering ill-advised sarcasm in place of fatherly wisdom.\" For Louise Keller, \"Burns, Diaz, Bahns and Aniston inject an energy and charisma of their own, and they're fun to watch.\" Paul Fischer found that Diaz and Aniston are \"both in fine form\". Alison Macor said, \"As Francis' wife Renee, Aniston provides one of the few bright spots in \"She's the One\". Playing Renee as the wry voice of sanity among the rest of the characters, Aniston shows that she's the one who makes this film somewhat enjoyable.\"\n\nCritics were less forgiving of Maxine Bahns. Mick LaSalle said about her, \"The graduate student, Hope, is played by Maxine Bahns, Burns' real-life girlfriend, who was also his love interest in \"McMullen\". Throw a rock out the window, and it's sure to hit someone with more acting talent than Bahns. She can't say a line without it ringing false and keeps smiling nervously, like a shy person at a party. In a way, it's rather sweet that Burns keeps casting Bahns. But \"She's the One\" would have been much improved had Burns given Jennifer Aniston the Bahns role. Instead Aniston is wasted here as the unloved wife of Mickey's callous brother, Francis (Mike McGlone of \"McMullen\"). She looks great, but all she gets to do is whine and smoke, and she all but disappears two-thirds of the way into the film.\"\n\n\nIn 2000, Fox Home Entertainment released \"Stories From Long Island: Three Films by Edward Burns\" ($70), a DVD set which included \"The Brothers McMullen\" (1995), \"She's the One\" and \"No Looking Back\" (1998).\n\n"}

{"id": "2217387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217387", "title": "The Yakuza", "text": "The Yakuza\n\nThe Yakuza is a 1975 neo-noir drama film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Robert Mitchum, Ken Takakura and Brian Keith. The screenplay by Paul Schrader and Robert Towne is from a story by Leonard Schrader. The film is about a retired American detective who returns to Japan after several years away in order to rescue his friend's daughter, kidnapped by gangsters. Following a lackluster initial release, the film has since gained a cult following.\n\nRetired detective Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) is called upon by an old friend, George Tanner (Brian Keith). Tanner has been doing business with a \"yakuza\" gangster, Tono (Eiji Okada), who has kidnapped Tanner's daughter to apply pressure in a business deal involving the sale of guns. Tanner hopes that Kilmer can rescue the girl using his Japanese connections.\n\nKilmer and Tanner had been Marine MPs in Tokyo during the post-war occupation. Kilmer became aware of a woman, Eiko (Keiko Kishi), who was involved in the black market so that she could procure penicillin for her sick daughter. Kilmer intervened on behalf of Eiko during a skirmish, saving her life. After they'd been living together, with Kilmer repeatedly asking Eiko to marry him, her brother Ken (Ken Takakura) returned from an island where he'd been stranded as an Imperial Japanese soldier. Both outraged that she was living with his former enemy and deeply indebted to Kilmer for saving the lives of his (apparently) only remaining family, Ken disappeared into the yakuza criminal underground and refused to see or speak to his sister. Eiko, cautious to do nothing to offend Ken further, broke off contact with Kilmer. Before returning to the US, Kilmer bought Eiko a bar (with money borrowed from George Tanner) which she operates to this day, named \"Kilmer House\" in his honor. Kilmer has never stopped loving her.\n\nKen's debt to Kilmer, \"giri,\" is a lifelong obligation that traditionally can never be repaid. Tanner believes that Ken would therefore do anything for Kilmer, including rescuing Tanner's daughter. Traveling to Tokyo with Tanner's bodyguard Dusty (Richard Jordan), they stay at the home of another old military buddy named Oliver Wheat (Herb Edelman). Kilmer visits Eiko at the bar's closing time, seeking to find Ken. Eiko's feelings for Kilmer are clearly as strong as ever. He also becomes reacquainted with Eiko's daughter, Hanako, who is delighted to see Kilmer again. Eiko tells Kilmer that her brother can be found at his kendo school in Kyoto.\n\nKilmer travels by train to visit Ken at his kendo school. Ken is no longer a yakuza member, but will still help Kilmer. They find and free the girl. In so doing, Ken \"takes up the sword\" once again, attacking one of Tono's men to save Kilmer. This is an inexcusable intrusion by Ken in yakuza affairs. Contracts on both Ken's and Kilmer's lives are issued. Despite Tanner's protests, Kilmer insists on staying until the danger to Ken can be resolved. Eiko suggests he see Ken's brother, a high-level legal counselor to the yakuza chiefs. Goro (James Shigeta) is unable to intercede due to his impartial role in yakuza society, but suggests Ken can remove the death threat by killing Tono with a sword. The only alternative is for Kilmer to kill Tono himself, by any means (as an outsider, he is not bound to use a sword). Because Kilmer is known to Goro as an unusual \"gaijin\" who understands and accepts Japanese values, he proposes that Kilmer now has an obligation to Ken.\n\nAfter an attempt on Kilmer's life at a bathhouse, he learns that his old friend Tanner has taken out the contract on him. Tanner secretly is broke and owes Tono a huge debt. Dusty discloses that Tanner and Tono are business partners. During a violent attack on Ken and Kilmer in Oliver Wheat's house, Dusty is stabbed to death with a sword and Hanako is shot and killed.\n\nSeeking advice again from Ken's brother, Goro advises them that they have no choice but to assassinate Tanner and Tono. This will embarrass the partners in the eyes of the yakuza. Goro discloses that he has a \"wayward son\" who has joined Tono's clan and asks that Ken protect him should he be caught in the battle. In private, Goro then discloses the shocking family secret to Kilmer that Eiko is not Ken's sister but his wife, and Hanako their only child. Kilmer comprehends the true meaning of Eiko and Ken's rift, and Ken's anguish at the death of Hanako, all brought about by his repeated intercessions in their lives.\n\nKilmer storms into Tanner's apartment and kills him, then joins Ken for a near-suicidal attack on Tono's residence. During a prolonged battle, after Ken kills Tono in the traditional way with a \"katana,\" Goro's son attacks them and Ken kills him in self-defense. Bearing the news to his brother, Ken moves to commit \"Seppuku,\" but his brother pleads with him not to bring more anguish to their family. Instead, Ken performs \"yubitsume\" (the ceremonial yakuza apology by cutting off one's little finger). After Ken excuses himself, Goro compliments Kilmer on his adherence to Japanese traditions, and dedication to his family.\n\nBefore leaving Japan, Kilmer visits with Ken at home and asks to speak to him formally. While Ken prepares tea, Kilmer quietly commits \"yubitsume,\" and when Ken enters the room, waits for him to be seated. Sliding the folded handkerchief that contains his finger to Ken, he says \"please accept this token of my apology\" for \"bringing great pain into your life, both in the past and in the present.\" Ken accepts, and Kilmer asks that \"if you can forgive me, then you can forgive Eiko,\" adding, \"you are greatly loved and respected by \"all\" your family.\" Ken professes that \"no man has a greater friend than Kilmer-san,\" and Kilmer, overcome by emotion, says the same of Ken. Their obligations now apparently resolved, Ken takes Kilmer to the airport, and both men bow formally to each other before parting.\n\nPaul Schrader says the idea for the film came from a letter sent to him by his brother Leonard, who was then living in Japan; Leonard had left the U.S. when he received his military draft induction card and found work teaching English at a Japanese university, but frequently found himself with nothing to do when radical students shut down the campus and ended up spending a lot of time in yakuza-run bars. He had also been watching yakuza films and been impressed by the presence of Ken Takakura and the rituals involved. He thought there was an interesting film to be made about a Westerner who became involved in the yakuza to such an extent he would \"make that ultimate sacrifice that is so foreign to a Westerner. That is the premise we started out on, trying to create a plot that would result in that situation.\"\n\nSchrader told the idea to co-producer Mark Hamilburg, who liked it and paid for the brothers to write it. They spent two months watching films, in particular Toei films at a cinema in Los Angeles. \"By the time I started writing, I was thinking like a Toei screenwriter,\" says Schrader. They wrote the script in an apartment in Venice over a month, between thanksgiving and Christmas. Schrader says Hamilburg saw the script \"was going to be a hot item: the intensity with which people became interested was clear. He knew he was incapable of handling a high-level auction, so he went to Robin French\" to handle the auction. French sold the script for $300,000.\n\nSchrader later reflected:\nIt's hard to see now, looking back at a film which completely flopped, but it was a very commercial idea. It had a lot of commercial hooks plus a strong love story, rich characters, and an \"in\" theme. It seemed to have all the elements for a rich, commercial action romance.\n\nOriginally, Robert Aldrich was to direct. Aldrich later called it \"one of the few pictures I really wanted to make\" although he wanted changes made. \"It was a terrible script, I thought, but a sensational idea. I said, 'If I'm going to make this picture, I'm going to turn this script upside down.' I saw it one particular way, and Paul didn't see it that way.\"\n\nAldrich thought his view might have prevailed if Lee Marvin had been cast in the lead, but Marvin disagreed with Warner Brothers over the size of the actor's fee. Instead they cast Robert Mitchum. Aldrich and Mitchum had worked together on \"The Angry Hills\" (1959), and the director said \"I really considered him my friend, and I admired him. I think he's a brilliant actor - a strange, convoluted guy. I knew I wasn't his favorite director, but I never really knew he disliked me.\" The two of them met, and Mitchum told Warners afterwards he did not want to do the film with Aldrich. \"Too bad,\" Aldrich said later. \"I think it was possible to make a marvelous movie out of \"Yakuza\".\"\n\nSydney Pollack then became attached. Schrader says that Pollack wanted rewrites, notably a \"softening\" of the Harry character. Schrader says \"I was fired, because I was unable to write what Sydney wanted. Sydney and I did not get along well, and he needed someone of his own age, whose work he respected, for feedback.\" Robert Towne came on to rewrite the film. \n\nRobert Redford was also interested but then decided he was not old enough.\n\nPollack remarked in interviews on complications of filming in Japan, using Japanese crews and technicians, and adopting techniques and practices of Japanese filmmaking. Beyond language barriers, there were creative approaches that he synthesized into the film for being appropriate for the subject matter.\n\nThe musical score for \"The Yakuza\" was composed by David Grusin. The score applies both Western and Eastern musical influences in what director Sydney Pollack described as a way that \"felt and sounded Japanese without being too strange for western ears.\" A soundtrack album was released by \"Film Score Monthly\" in July 2005.\n\n\nSchrader says the reception to the film was \"disastrous. It cost five million and brought back maybe a million and a half.\"\n\nHe felt the casting of Mitchum - which he was \"very pleased with\" - hurt the movie at the box office and if Redford had played the role \"we probably would have made money.\"\n\nSchrader felt Pollack \"directed against the grain of the script. I wrote a violent, underworld film about blood, duty, and obligation. He made a sort of rich, romantic, transcultural film. Either of those films would be interesting if fully realized, but the final product fell between those two stools; neither film was made. It didn't satisfy the audience that came to see the hard gangster world, and it didn't satisfy the JEREMIAH JOHNSON audience - Sydney's audience - which came to see some poetic realism.\"\n\nSchrader says his biggest regret from the film is that Takakura did not become an international star.\nThe film received mixed reviews at the time of release. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 53% based on 15 reviews. \n\nRoger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, awarding it two-and-a-half stars out of four. While praising the characterization and the performances of Robert Mitchum and Ken Takakura, he criticized the plot as being somewhat difficult to follow and expressed concern over the level of violence: \"it's for audiences that have grown accustomed over the last few years to buckets of blood, disembowelments and severed hands flying through the air. It's very violent, and the fact that the violence has been choreographed by a skilled director (Sidney Pollack, who made \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\") just makes it all the more extreme.\" Lawrence Van Gelder of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Although admirable for its understated contrast of hoary ritual with modern trappings, 'The Yakuza' ... is also didactic. It is slowed by the need to instruct its audience in the way of the yakuza; it is marred in its early exposition by some impenetrable Japanese-accented English; it is burdened by the attenuation of an unexciting love interest (which Mitchum's character freely admits being too old for); and a couple of formidably important revelations are simply dropped in, as though no one had the time to plot them properly.\"\n\nArthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" called it \"a confused and diffused film which bites off more than it can artfully chew.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film three stars out of four and called it \"a special kind of gangster picture\" with \"an extremely complex story\" and \"stylish sword-fighting sequences. But don't confuse them with the boring karate chops so common in the Oriental sludge that typically fills our downtown theaters. The fighting in 'The Yakuza' is more ritualistic and more meaningful because we know who is attacking whom and why.\" \n\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" thought that the film \"suffers from a self-consciousness so stultifying it never really comes alive, its sense of reality (or lack of it) deriving from other movies instead of life itself.\" \n\nGary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" called the film \"such a clumsy combination of violence and inscrutability that the action becomes slightly laughable,\" further observing, \"The right director for this slightly dubious material would have been Sam Peckinpah, who possesses both a taste and a flair for violence ... Sydney Pollack, the director chosen, gets sentimental about violent men, but he isn't on their wavelength.\" \n\nTony Rayns of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that Takakura \"dominates the screen\" with \"his masterfully understated performance,\" concluding, \"If \"The Yakuza\" is ultimately no more than a curious footnote to the Western exploitation of Oriental action movies, then it finds at least some self-justification in bringing a major film personality to a much wider audience.\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino is an admirer of the film saying \"for the last time as a lead, Mitchum was vibrantly alive... Takakura Ken’s powerhouse performance, at the height of his fame, in this Hollywood Yakuza flick, seems even more of a triumph... the film’s final coda, “The Finger cutting scene,” is, for me, one of the great endings of any movie of its era. And arguably Mitchum’s single greatest acting moment on film (as long as some fuckwad in the cinema doesn’t laugh during it).\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217400", "title": "Word Association", "text": "Word Association\n\nWord Association is a common word game involving an exchange of words that are associated together. The game is based on the noun phrase word association, meaning \"stimulation of an associative pattern by a word\" or \"the connection and production of other words in response to a given word, done spontaneously as a game, creative technique, or in a psychiatric evaluation.\"\n\nOnce an original word has been chosen, usually randomly or arbitrarily, a player will find a word that they associate with it and make it known to all the players, usually by saying it aloud or writing it down as the next item on a list of words so far used. The next player must then do the same with this previous word. This continues in turns for any length of time, but often word limits are set, so that the game is agreed to end after, for instance, 400 words.\n\nUsually, players write down the next word by merely using the first word that comes to their mind after they hear the previous one. Sometimes however they may put in more thought to find a more creative connection between the words. Exchanges are often fast and sometimes unpredictable (though logical patterns can usually be found without difficulty). Sometimes, a lot of the game's fun can arise from the seemingly strange or amusing associations that people make between words. It is also found amusing what you can get from an original word, and how they contrast distinctly, for example, from the word \"tea\" you could get the word \"murder\".\n\nThe game can be played actively or passively, sometimes taking many weeks to complete, and can in fact be played with any number of players, even one.\nExample:\nSoda,\nSprite,\nFairy,\nTinkerbell,\nPeter Pan,\nPans, Skillet,\nKitchens,\nRefrigerator,\nDrinks,\nSoda\n\nIn some games, extra limitations are added, for instance:\n\n\nIt is believed that word association can reveal something of a person's subconscious mind (as it shows what things they associate together), but others are skeptical of how effective such a technique could be in psychology.\n\nOften, the game's goal is to compare the first and final word, to see if they relate, or to see how different they are, or also to see how many words are repeated. Likewise, players often review the list of words to see the pathways of associations that go from beginning to end.\n\nWord association has been used by market researchers to ensure the proper message is conveyed by names or adjectives used in promoting a company's products. For example, James Vicary, working in the 1950s, tested the word 'lagered' for a brewing company. While about a third of his subjects associated the word with beer, another third associated it with tiredness, dizziness and so forth. As a result of the study, Vicary's client decided not to use the word. \n\nIn the early years of psychology, many doctors noted that patients exhibited behavior that they were not in control of. Some part of the personality seemed to have an influence on that person's behavior that was not in his/her conscious control. This part was, by function, unconscious, and became so named the Unconscious. Carl Jung theorized that people connect ideas, feelings, experiences and information by way of associations ... that ideas and experiences are linked, or grouped, in the unconscious in such a manner as to exert influence over the individual’s behavior. These groupings he named Complexes.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Weigel Broadcasting. KCSG's studios are located on West 1600 South Street in St. George, and its transmitter is located on Cedar Mountain, southeast of Cedar City. The station has a network of about 15 broadcast translators that extend its over-the-air coverage throughout southwestern Utah. KCSG is also available on DirecTV, Dish Network, Galaxy 19, and cable systems throughout the geographically large Salt Lake City media market.\n\nKCSG began as KCCZ, with a construction permit issued on June 11, 1984 to Michael Glenn Golden. After several extensions and replacements of expired permits, and transfer of the permit to Liberty Broadcasting Company, the station first signed on the air in April 23, 1990, operating as an independent station; it was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission on June 21, 1990. However, financial difficulties doomed KCCZ and it shut down in November 1992. Liberty Broadcasting filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 17, 1992, but the filing had to be converted to Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 22, 1993. On October 20, Seagull Communications Company, whose principals owned KSGI radio (1450 AM, now KZNU, and 99.9 FM, now KONY) in St. George, filed an application to acquire the station out of bankruptcy and on November 12, changed its call letters to KSGI-TV to match the radio stations. The acquisition was approved by the FCC and consummated on February 1, 1994. Seagull Communications returned the station to air the same day, again as an independent station.\n\nAlmost immediately, the new owners applied to the FCC to build booster stations serving St. George, Utah and Beaver Dam, Arizona/Mesquite, Nevada, communities cut off from the signal due to the mountainous terrain of those areas. The FCC granted the construction permit for the St. George booster, KSGI1 (later KCSG1), on February 28, 1995, but did not grant a permit for the Beaver Dam booster, KSGI2 (later KCSG2), until January 1998. That station was never built, but the construction permit remained in the FCC database until 2009.\n\nIn 1997, Seagull Communications sold KSGI-TV to Bonneville Holding Company, a broadcasting company wholly owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The sale was approved by the FCC on December 10, 1997 and was consummated on April 27, 1998. On February 16, 1998, the station changed its call letters to KXIV, in anticipation of its DTV channel assignment on UHF channel 14, but the FCC adopted the virtual channel standard, whereby digital stations would continue to identify by their analog channel assignment, and on May 15, 1998, the station again changed call letters, this time to KCSG. On August 31, 1998, the station became a charter affiliate of the family-oriented network Pax TV (now Ion Television). In August 2002, KCSG was sold to Broadcast West, a St. George-based partnership of Daniel Matheson and local auto dealer Stephen Wade. The new owners elected to continue the Pax affiliation and to maintain an association with Bonneville-owned KSL-TV (channel 5).\nBroadcast West began to make changes to KCSG that would establish its identity as a Southern Utah station. In 2003, the company founded the region's first television news department for the station. Before, the only local news program available to residents of Cedar City and St. George came from Salt Lake City area stations. In June 2005, with Pax TV preparing to adopt a more general entertainment format, KCSG switched its affiliation to America One, continuing to offer family-focused programming. The station made news in September 2005, when it began offering its news programs in Spanish, as well as in English, attempting to serve the region's growing Hispanic population. The Broadcast West partnership was dissolved on October 18, 2005, and a new company, Southwest Media, owned by Stephen Wade, became the licensee.\n\nOn August 18, 2008, KCSG replaced Salt Lake City's KJZZ-TV (also on channel 14) as Utah's MyNetworkTV affiliate. The station added programming from the Retro Television Network, which was previously carried in the market by KUSG and KCBU, in 2009. For a time, starting on September 20, 2010, KCSG was one of two MyNetworkTV affiliates serving the geographically large Utah media market, along with KUSG; the affiliation was subsequently ceded completely to the renamed KMYU (channel 12).\n\nOn September 5, 2011, KCSG switched its primary affiliation to classic television network MeTV On July 26, 2012, KCSG added FamilyNet to Baja Broadband channel 87. FamilyNet is limited to cable and satellite viewing because of programming restrictions placed on it by the network. Otherwise, FamilyNet would have been added to digital subchannel 14.4.\n\nOn September 29, 2014, KCSG switched its affiliation from MeTV to Heroes & Icons, a new network owned by MeTV's parent company (and KCSG's future owner), Weigel Broadcasting, as its first non-owned affiliate. The network mainly carries a format of crime shows and westerns targeted to men from the MeTV acquisition library. MeTV is still available throughout the state via KTVX-DT2.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, Weigel (through TV-49, Inc., the licensee of WMLW-TV in Racine, Wisconsin) agreed to acquire the station for $1.1 million. The sale will convert KCSG in a H&I owned-and-operated station, though the possibility of Weigel's other networks being contained to it is also possible. It would also be Weigel's first purchase of any station outside of a state along Lake Michigan, as all of its properties are in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. The sale closed on December 5, with the St. George-related channel contracts voided the week before in order to make it a station only carrying H&I and Decades for the moment.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn January 24, 2011, KCSG began carrying My Family TV programming on digital subchannel 14.2 and local information and music service on digital channel 14.3.\n\nOn July 7, 2013, KCSG added FamilyNet to digital subchannel 14.2, moving My Family TV to digital subchannel 14.4.\n\nOn November 18, 2013, KCSG removed FamilyNet on digital subchannel 14.2, moving My Family TV back to digital subchannel 14.2.\n\nOn March 22, 2014, KCSG re-added FamilyNet to digital subchannel 14.2, moving The Family Channel to digital subchannel 14.4.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, KCSG re-removed FamilyNet on digital subchannel 14.2, moving The Family Channel back to digital subchannel 14.2.

Until KCSG started its news department, St. George residents received local newscasts from stations in Salt Lake City; indeed, KCSG itself simulcast KSL-TV's morning newscast for a time under Bonneville ownership. The station's news operation began in 2003 with a five-minute newscast; this subsequently expanded to half-hour newscasts at 5:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. KCSG discontinued its newscasts on February 19, 2010; the station still broadcasts news updates and still places news stories on its website.\n\nAfter a six-month hiatus, full-scale newscasts were reinstated on August 23, 2010, with the early evening newscast now airing at 6:30 p.m., in addition to the 9 p.m. newscast.

{"id": "2217436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217436", "title": "5th Combined Arms Army", "text": "5th Combined Arms Army\n\nThe 5th Combined Arms Red Banner Army (5-я общевойсковая армия) is a Russian Ground Forces formation in the Eastern Military District.\n\nIt was formed in 1939, served during the Soviet invasion of Poland that year, and was deployed in the southern sector of the Soviet defences when Adolf Hitler's Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941 during World War II. In the disastrous first months of Barbarossa, the 5th Army was encircled and destroyed around Kiev.\n\nReformed under Lelyushenko and Govorov, it played a part in the last-ditch defence of Moscow, and then in the string of offensive and defensive campaigns that eventually saw the Soviet armies liberate all of Soviet territory and push west into Poland and beyond into Germany itself. The 5th Army itself only advanced as far as East Prussia before it was moved east to take part in the Soviet attack on Japan. Since 1945 under the Soviet and now Russian flag it has formed part of the Far East Military District keeping watch on the border with the People's Republic of China. As the Russian armed force shrunk it found itself part of the larger Eastern Military District in the twenty-first century.\n\nThe 5th Army was created in August 1939 in the Special Kiev Military District from the Northern (originally Shepetovskaya) Army Group. In September 1939 the 5th Army took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland, which had been justified by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The Army was originally placed under the command of I.G. Sovietnikov.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, the 5th Army consisted of the 15th Rifle Corps (under Colonel I.I. Fedyuninsky and incorporating the 45th Rifle Division and 62nd Rifle Divisions), as well as the 27th Rifle Corps (87th, 125th, 135th Rifle Divisions), the 22nd Mechanised Corps (19th, 41st Tank Divisions, 215th Motorized Division), the 2nd Fortified Region, seven artillery regiments, 2 NKVD border regiments, and an engineer regiment.\n\nThe Army's rifle divisions were assigned to cover the Lutsk-Rovno approaches to the Ukraine and were tasked to man the (unfinished) Kovel, Strumilov, and Vladimir-Volynsk fortified districts. The Army was stationed in barracks up to forty miles from the frontier, and would need three to four days to take up its positions. On 22 June, however, the 15th Rifle Corps managed to take its place in the line, holding the sector from Vlodava to Vladimir-Volynsk, but later that same day, the southern end of the line at Vladimir-Volynsk \"began to buckle in,\" in John Erickson's words.\n\nThe main German thrust in the sector came at the junction point between the 5th Army and its neighbour to the south, the 6th Army, and both the 5th and 6th Armies committed their mechanised forces quickly to try to stem the gap, but without success. The Commander Southwestern Front, Mikhail Kirponos, decided to halt this with an attack into the flank of Panzer Group 1 using all the available mobile forces – five mechanised corps. This was unsuccessful in the face of the thrusting German advance, lack of coordination from the various Soviet formations, acute shortage of equipment and spares, and lack of proper equipment, especially radio sets. Meanwhile General M.I. Potapov, now commanding the 5th Army, was ordered on 29 June to make another attack on Panzer Group 1's flank from the woods of Klevany. Amid these efforts, Kirponos managed to withdraw most of his Front to a new line almost on the old Soviet/Polish border, and prevented the Germans from rupturing the Soviet defensive line.\n\nThe 11th Panzer Division took Berdichev on 7 July, and the juncture between the 5th and 6th Armies was broken; the Stavka ordered Kirponos to withdraw the 5th Army to the Korosten \"fortified district\" northwest of Kiev. The gap between the 5th and 6th Armies quickly widened to forty miles. To remedy the situation another counterattack was ordered, and Potapov, now commanding the 15th and 31st Rifle, and 9th, 19th and 22nd Mechanised Corps, was directed to strike northwards from Berdichev and Lyubar. However, his forces had been badly worn down: the 9th Mechanised Corps had 64 tanks left, the 22nd less than half that number, and the rifle regiments of 31st Corps had \"no more than three hundred men.\" Nevertheless, Potapov's force cut the Zhitomir highway and kept up the pressure for a week, and afterwards remained as a thorn on the German Sixth Army's northern flank.\n\nBy 7 September the 5th Army was threatened with being split in two by the Second Army coming from the east and the Sixth Army's northern outflanking of Kiev. The Stavka refused permission initially for the 5th Army to withdraw, as they were still hoping for results from a counterattack by the Bryansk Front. By 9 September Stalin had finally given authority for the 5th Army to withdraw but by then it was trapped, and on 20 September Potapov and his command group were taken prisoner. In the disastrous battle, the German forces encircled forces from the 5th, 21st, 26th, 38th and 37th Armies, captured Kiev, and claimed 665,000 prisoners (Soviet sources assert that the total strength of the Southwestern Front was 677,000 of which 150,000 had escaped).\n\nThe 5th Army was re-raised for the second time in October 1941, under the command of Dmitri Lelyushenko, as part of the Soviet Western Front. Recent sources give the actual re-raising date as 11 October 1941. It included two rifle divisions and three tank brigades. At the Battle at Borodino Field, on a former Napoleonic battlefield, the first elements of the reforming Army to arrive at the front—two regiments of the Soviet 32nd Rifle Division and the 18th and 19th Tank Brigades—attempted to halt the German 10th Panzer Division and Das Reich divisions which were striking for Mozhaisk. Lelyuschenko was wounded and General L.A. Govorov took over. What thin reserves there were ran out, and Mozhaisk fell on 18 October. Later that year the Army took part in the Klin-Solnechogorsk offensive operation.\n\nOn 15 November, another German strike toward Moscow opened, but while the flanks saw heavy fighting, up until 28 November, the 5th Army along with the two other Armies forming Western Front’s centre, 33rd and 43rd, were holding quite firmly, despite some attacks on the right-most sector of their line. On 1 December, a last effort by the German XX Army Corps to reach Moscow saw a furious attack directed near the junction of the 5th Army and 33rd Army, which led to the Moscow-Minsk highway, the most direct route to the Soviet capital. Despite breaking through 33rd Army defences around Naro-Fominsk, after all available reserves were directed by Zhukov toward the breach, by 4 December the situation had been restored and the Soviet command could resume its planning to take the offensive.\n\nAs part of the Soviet winter counteroffensive from Moscow, the 5th Army was instructed to commence its offensive actions from 11 December, pushing for Ruza-Kolyubakovo, while right flank units joined the 16th Army in hitting Istra. Eventually the 5th Army defeated the Germans near Zvenigorod, and the 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps forced itself into the German rear in a daring raid, making further advances possible. In Western Front directives of 6 and 8 January 1942, the 5th Army received orders to first outflank, and then to retake, Mozhaisk by 16 January. The 5th Army, now boasting seven rifle divisions, 82nd Motorised Rifle Division, three independent rifle brigades and 20th Tank Brigade, was on the move by mid January, and on 20 January took the town. However Govorov's rifle divisions were falling to below 2,500 each, and the Army ‘started to run out of steam.’\n\nOn 20 March a Stavka directive gave new instructions to the Western and Kalinin Fronts, and among these, the 5th Army was ordered, when the offensive kicked off, to take Gzhatsk by 1 April, after which it was to capture Vyazma in conjunction with the 43rd, 49th, and 50th Armies. In April 1942 Govorov was posted to command the Leningrad Front, and apparently General Ivan Fedyuninsky took over. Some time after that, Y.T. Cherevichenko took command.\n\nAs part of the Western Front the 5th Army then took part in the Operation of Rzhev-Vyazma, including the Second Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive in November–December 1942. It then fought with the 10th Guards & 33rd Armies in the Second Battle of Smolensk, by which time the Army was being commanded by General V.S. Polenov. At a later point, General P.G. Shafranov held command for a period. For Operation Bagration of 1944 in Belorussia, 5th Army was part of 3rd Belorussian Front. The 5th Army, now under General N.I. Krylov, was allocated to the Front's 'Northern Group' alongside 39th Army and a Cavalry mechanized group made up of 3rd Cavalry and 3rd Guards Mechanised Corps. The Army's path took it through Vilnius, which was cleared on 13 July with the assistance of the Polish underground after a final savage battle in the city centre. On 1 August 1944 the Army consisted of the 45th Rifle Corps (159th, 184th, 338th Rifle Divisions), the 65th Rifle Corps (97th, 144th, 371st RDs), the 72nd Rifle Corps (63rd, 215th, 277th RDs) and a wide array of supporting artillery, armour, and other units. The Army's final action in Europe was the East Prussian Offensive of 1945. Units of 184th Rifle Division, assigned as part of the 5th Army, were the first Soviet soldiers to reach the prewar frontier on 17 August 1944. With the other armies of 3rd Belorussian Front, 5th Army then took part in the failed Gumbinnen Operation of October 1944, in which the Soviets were not able to break the German East Prussian defences. In the course of the second East Prussian offensive, in interaction with other armies of the front, the 5th Army destroyed the Tilsit-Insterburg and Khalchberg enemy groups and on 23 January occupied Insterburg. In the closing stage of its European service it participated in the liquidation of the Wehrmacht troops trapped on the Samland peninsula, the XXVIII Corps.\n\nOn 20 April 1945, the 5th Army was transferred from Stavka VGK reserve to the Maritime Group of Forces, one of the formations which was being sent to the Far East to reinforce Soviet forces there in preparation for the beginning of hostilities against Japan. The MGF was re-designated the 1st Far East Front on 5 August 1945. When the Soviet invasion of Manchuria commenced, the Army consisted of the 17th Rifle Corps (187th and 366th Rifle Divisions), 45th Rifle Corps (157th, 159th, and 184th Rifle Divisions), 65th Rifle Corps (97th, 144th, 190th, 371st Rifle Divisions), 72nd Rifle Corps (63rd, 215th, 277th Rifle Divisions), the 72nd, 76th, 208th, 210th, and 218th Tank Brigades, the 105th Fortified Area, over 35 artillery brigades and regiments, and other units. During the Harbin-Girin operation, the Army’s troops, part of the 1st Far East Front’s main attack, broke through the Volynskiy area where the Japanese troops were resisting and advanced to the eastern spurs of the Taypinliy ridge.\n\n\nAfter the victory over Japan, the 5th Army remained in the Far East, and was the most powerful army in the Far East Military District throughout the entire postwar period. After the disbandment of the 9th Mechanised Army and the 25th Army in 1957, 5th Army's composition was supplemented by a whole series of divisions, including the divisions that became, after many redesignations, 277th Motor Rifle Division and 123rd Guards MRD. The 4th Missile Brigade joined the army in 1963. In 1968 the 29th Motor Rifle Division arrived from Shikhany (Saratov Oblast) at Kamen-Rybolov, Primorskiy Kray. In the 1970s and 1980s, the 81st Guards MRD and the 199th MRDs became part of the 5th Army. There were also several fortified regions attached. In 1976 the 119th Motor Rifle Division (mobilisation) was formed at Lyalichi, Primorskiy Kray, which became the 77th Tank Division (mobilisation) in January 1982. General Igor Rodionov, later the Russian Minister of Defence, commanded the Army from 1983 to 1985.\n\nIn 1987 the 77th Tank Division became the 1008th Territorial Training Centre, then a VKhVT in 1989, then was disbanded in 1993.\n\nThe 5th Army still exists today, with headquarters at Ussuriysk, but has seen much reorganisation and reductions. On 29 November 2000 the then Far East Military District commander, General Colonel Yuri Yakubov, was reported in \"Vremya Novostei\" as saying that only 'four fully staffed operational regiments and several operational divisions' in the district were combat ready. In addition, the last exercise for reserve divisions was run in 1985. One regiment at Yekaterinoslavka was reported in October 1999 as being the only 100% manned regiment in 35th Army, so it could be guessed that during the 1999–2000 time period the remaining three full-strength regiments were with the 5th Army.\n\nIn 2007 Russian reports described the army as consisting of the 81st Guards (Bikin) and 121st Motor Rifle Division (Sibirtsevo), the 127th (Segreevka) and 129th (Barabash) MGADs, the 130th Machine-Gun Artillery Division (Lesozavodsk), 20th Rocket Brigade (Spassk-Dalny) (OTR-21 Tochka SSM), 719th Multiple Rocket Launcher Regiment (Pokrovka), 958th Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, and other smaller combat and support formations.\n\n\n\n"}

The Calgary Tower is included in this list for comparison purposes; however, it is not ranked since it is not considered a habitable building.\n\nCalgary's history of towers began with the Grain Exchange Building (1910), the Fairmont Palliser Hotel (1914), and the Elveden Centre. Building construction remained slow in the city until the early 1970s. From 1970 to 1990, Calgary witnessed a major expansion of skyscraper and high-rise construction. Many of the city's office towers were completed during this period, such as the First Canadian Centre and the Canterra Tower office towers. A ten-year lull in building construction came after the expansion, though Calgary experienced a larger second building expansion beginning in the late 90s and continuing into the present. Currently, the city has height restrictions that prevent any building from casting a shadow over the Bow River and the city hall, however, winter months are excluded from this limit. There is no other imposed limits elsewhere in the city, which could allow for some extremely tall buildings. The Bow Tower was originally proposed to be at least 1,000 feet tall but reduced to comply with these rules. Calgary hosts 373 buildings over complete and under construction, 82 of which are or more and are all in the downtown area.

According to Alexander Cunningham and William Crooke, Bamraulia gotra Jats from village Bamrauli (near Agra) in 1505 founded the city Gohad near Gwalior. Singhandev was the founder of Gohad state. Later it developed into an important Suryavanshi Hindu Jat State. The Jat rulers of Gohad were awarded the title of Rana.\n\nMaharaja Bhim Singh Rana played an important role in keeping a power balance in Malwa. The Delhi Mughal ruler sent Jai Singh of Jaipur as satrap of Malwa in 1729. Malharrao Holkar, Udaji Panwar and Kanthaji Panwar encountered Jay Singh at the Mandavgarh fort. Jay Singh succeeded in defeating the Marathas, with the help of Maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur state. \n\nMaharaja Bhim Singh Rana helped Suraj Mal in this mission. This alliance made them the enemies of the Marathas.\n\nBhim Singh Rana increased his powers and was planning to expand his territories. He marched to Malwa in 1736 but came back and targeted the Gwalior Fort. Marathas were also in race to win the Gwalior Fort. The weak and easy-going Mughal satrap Alikhan, looking to the power of Jats, surrendered the fort to Bhim Singh Rana. Meanwhile there was a severe fight between Marathas and Jats to win the Gwalior Fort but Jats won and the Gwalior fort came under Jats. \n\nBhim Singh Rana occupied the Gwalior fort from 1740-1756.\nIn 1756 Marathas attacked the Gwalior Fort under the leadership of Great Warrior ShindeScindia with a huge army. There was a severe war between the Jat Army and the Maratha Army down below the fort. At one time Bhim Singh Rana was not riding horse at that time Maratha Atrao attacked Rana with sword. Bhim Singh Rana was wounded and carried out of the war site by his soldiers. He died after three days in month of Chaitra in 1756. His queen Roshani committed jauhar. The fort came in occupation of Marathas.\n\nMaharaja Bhim Singh had constructed a historical monument Bhimtal in 1754 on the Gwalior fort. His successor Maharaja Chhatra Singh Rana constructed a grand Chhatri near Bhimtal in memory of Maharaja Bhim Singh on the Gwalior Fort. Jat Samaj Kalyan Parishad Gwalior organizes a fair on Gwalior fort on Ram Navami every year in honour of Maharaja Bhim Singh Rana.\n\nRana Bhim Singh had no son. Girdhar Pratap Singh became his successor in 1755. Girdhar Pratap Singh was son of Samant Rao Balju, a family friend of Rana Bhim Singh. Girdhar Pratap Singh could not rule Gohad for long as he died in 1757. His successor was Rana Chhatar Singh (1757–1785).\n\n"}

Chamkila and his wife Amarjot were killed, along with two members of their band on 8 March 1988 in an assassination which remains unresolved.\n\nAmar Singh Chamkila is regarded as one of the best live stage performers that Punjab has ever produced and extremely popular with the village (pind) audience. His monthly bookings regularly outnumbered the amount of days in the month.\n\nHis music was heavily influenced by the Punjabi village life he was surrounded by growing up. He commonly wrote songs about extra-marital relationships, coming of age, drinking, drug use, and the hot tempers of Punjabi men. He earned a controversial reputation, with his detractors regarding his music obscene, and his supporters regarding it a truthful commentary on Punjabi culture and society.\n\nHis best-known hits include \"Pehle Lalkare Naal\" and his devotional songs \"Baba Tera Nankana\" and \"Talwar Main Kalgidhar Di\". Though he never recorded it himself, he wrote the widely popular \"Jatt Di Dushmani\" which has been recorded by many Punjabi artists. \nHe became famous as a result of his first ever recorded song Takue Te Takua.\n\nAmar Singh Chamkila born on 21 July 1960 in the village of Dugri near Ludhiana, Punjab, India. The youngest child of Kartar Kaur and Hari Ram Singh, he was educated at Gujar Khan Primary School in Dugri. His aspirations of becoming an electrician were unfulfilled and he found work at a Ludhiana cloth mill.\n\nWith a natural aptitude for music, he learned to play the harmonium and dholki. In 1979, Chamkila approached Shinda for the first time on a bicycle with his best friend Kuldeep Paras. When Shinda heard the 18-year-old Chamkila sing, he finally found the protege that he had been looking for.\nChamkila would go on to play alongside Punjabi folk artists such as K. Deep, Mohammad Sadiq and Surinder Shinda. He wrote several songs for Shinda and accompanied him as a member of his entourage before deciding to pursue a solo career.\n\nIt is rumoured that Chamkila was happy enough writing songs, but he wasn't earning enough money to look after his family, so had to start singing.\n\nChamkila's first time in the studio was providing backing vocals alongside Kuldeep Paras for Surinder Shinda's hit song \"Putt Jattan De\".\n\nHe was married to Gurmail Kaur by family with whom he had two daughters, Amandeep Kaur and Kamaldeep Kaur. Chamkila's second marriage was with his co-singer Amarjot Kaur, with whom he has a son Jaiman Chamkila. It was a love marriage held on 23 May 1983. Chamkila had spoken with close friends that he felt compelled to marry Amarjot as that was the only way to ensure the duet stayed together.\n\nAdopting the stage name Amar Singh Chamkila – Chamkila in Punjabi means \"one that glitters\". Chamkila first partnered up with the female vocalist Surinder Sonia who had previously worked with Surinder Shinda. Sonia had felt sidelined after Shinda took Gulshan Komal to a tour in Canada, after which she was instrumental in pushing Chamkila to record his debut album. The pair recorded eight duets and released the album \"Takue Te Takua\" in 1980 with music produced by Charanjit Ahuja. The cunningly worded lyrics, which he had written himself, became hits across Punjab.\n\nIn 1980, Chamkila felt he was significantly underpaid by Surinder Sonia's manager (her husband) and decided to form his own group. Chamkila established short-lived stage partnerships with Miss Usha Kiran, Amar Noorie and others. \n\nChamkila was struggling to find a long-term co-singer to record songs with until fellow Punjabi singer Kuldeep Manak suggested Amarjot Kaur, who had been singing infrequently with Manak and had even featured on his latest album. Not much is known about Amarjot Kaur, except for the fact that she was previously married but left the marriage to pursue her dream of singing. She would go on to become Chamkila's permanent singing partner providing the female vocals for his duets, that is, the majority of the songs that he wrote.\n\nChamkila, for the most part, wrote his own lyrics, the majority of which were boyish and suggestive, yet fluent, commentaries on extramarital affairs, alcohol and drug use. The couple's appeal grew not only in the Punjab, but they quickly raced to international stardom among Punjabis abroad. Around this time, Chamkila was rumoured to be receiving more bookings than his contemporaries. The biography \"Awaz Mardi Nahin\" by Gulzar Singh Shaunki found during its research that at the height of his popularity Chamkila had performed 366 shows in 365 days.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Chamkila and Amarjot had recorded hugely successful LPs on the HMV label and they toured Canada, US, Dubai and Bahrain. They were also commonly booked for wedding parties, charging a reported Rs. 4000 per performance, an unprecedented amount for the time. Chamkila sold more HMV LP records in the world than any other Punjabi singer. He was also an accomplished player of the Tumbi instrument.\n\nMuch of Chamkila's success may be attributed to the fan-base he acquired performing in free, open-air concerts (known as Akhade in Punjabi) around Punjab. Accompanying the couple would be a harmonium and dholki player and Chamkila would play the Tumbi. The concerts served as a medium for gaining exposure and testing people's response to new songs that were planned for future recordings. In addition to singing his own songs, Chamkila wrote several songs and sold them to other artists. Some of these include \"Main Digie Tilak Ke\" (Surinder Shinda), \"Gabroo Nu Marda\" (Jagmohan Kaur) and \"Deor Naal Nach Bhabiye\" (KS Kooner). Chamkila continued to work with music director Charanjit Ahuja but also experimented by working with SN Gulati and KS Narula.\n\nStarting in 1985, Chamkila and Amarjot released three devotional LPs: Baba Tera Nankana, Talwar Main Kalgidhar Di Haan and Naam Jap Le. The LPs were highly successful, with profits reportedly donated to charities.\n\nChamkila's song \"Pehle Lalkare Naal\" was featured in the soundtrack of the 1987 Punjabi film 'Patola'. He also recorded the song \"Mera Jee Karda\" for the Punjabi film 'Dupatta'. Both films fared averagely at the box office, but still increased Chamkila's popularity. Chamkila and Amarjot recorded in excess of ninety songs before they were killed in Mesumpur, Punjab in 1988. At the time of his death, he reportedly had 200 songs that had not been sung or recorded. Of these some were sung at stage shows including \"Dhee Mar Jai Badkar Loko\", \"Jatt Di Dushmani\" and \"Akhiyan Di Maar Buri\". Chamkila also wrote a song based on Punjabi folk hero Jeona Morh called \"Kaadha Soorma\" - a stage recording of Chamkila's vocals were remixed and released by Panjabi MC in 2007.\n\nHe also had many solo songs which have been sung in recent times by artists such as Chamak Chamkila, Nirmal Sidhu, Amar Arshi, and even his teacher Surinder Shinda. Some singers have used some of Chamkila's lyrics in their songs as part of their chorus. These include Nasha, Mere Yaar Ne (Gippy Grewal) and Shad De Vairne Yaari (Jazzy B). Chamkila's lyrics and compositions continue to be popular in contemporary Punjabi music.\n\nFollowing various complaints to his office, Chamkila appeared before a five-member Sikh committee at the Golden Temple to seek forgiveness for any offence caused by his lyrics. The committee praised his hugely successful religious song \"Talwar Main Kalgidhar Di Haan\" and Chamkila was encouraged to lend his voice to religious songs going forward. Chamkila, working alongside friend and lyricist Swarn Sivia, was in the process of preparing for a studio recording of Asa Di Var however due to Chamkila's death this was never recorded. \n\nBefore his death, Chamkila was working on publishing a magazine titled 'Gaunda Punjab, which would include articles regarding prominent singers, upcoming artists and news from the Punjabi film and music industry. \nWith considerable experience in theatre during his teenage years, Chamkila was also in talks to star in a lead role in the Punjabi movie 'Guldasta' directed by Veerendra and alongside Sridevi in a Punjabi movie titled 'Naanke'. Both films were never made.\n\nHaving arrived to perform in Mehsampur, Punjab, both Chamkila and Amarjot were gunned down as they exited their vehicle on 8 March 1988 at approximately 2PM. A gang of motorcyclists fired several rounds, fatally wounding the couple and other members of the entourage. However, no arrests were ever made with connection to the shooting and the case was never solved.\n\nThere are many conspiracy theories as to why Chamkila was killed. It is widely reported that he had been the victim of several death threats. The nature of those threats or the rationale behind them still remains a mystery. The high-profile murder sparked a frenzy of controversy and speculation. Some of the most prominent theories explaining the killings are:\n\nIndian film composer Amit Trivedi called Chamkila \"a legend, the Elvis of Punjab.\"\n\nBritish Indian musician, Panjabi MC, cites Chamkila as one of his musical influences. The song \"Kaadha Soorma\" from his 2008 album, \"Indian Timing\", includes Chamkila's vocals.\nDiljit Dosanjh also sang Chamkila's songs and was inspired by him.\n\nIndian filmmaker Gunjit Chopra has completed a Chamkila biopic. and is working on a script for a full-length feature film. His life story also inspired Gurjind Maan scriptwriting movie \"Amar Chamkila\" as well as starred in as him. The movie is directed by Taaj and set to be released by the end of 2017. Also, an award winning Mockumentary named \"Mehsampur' ' is based on Chamkila's life and is produced and directed by Kabir Singh Chowdhry.\n\nChamkila's studio recordings were released by HMV as LP records and EP records during his lifetime. Though several compilation albums have been released since his death, the following CDs compiled by Saregama comprise nearly all of Chamkila's studio recordings:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217455", "title": "St. Catharines Falcons", "text": "St. Catharines Falcons\n\nThe St. Catharines Falcons were a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1943 to 1947. The team was based in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe Garden City was introduced to OHA Junior \"A\" Hockey in the fall of 1943 when the St. Catharines Falcons made their debut in the league. Rudy Pilous, a former St. Catharines Sr. \"A\" hockey player and his friend Jay MacDonald were inspired to bring a team to St. Catharines after watching a Memorial Cup game in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in the spring of 1943 between the Winnipeg Royals and Oshawa Generals.\n\nPilous would be coach & general manager of the team, and MacDonald would be secretary & treasurer. Pilous raised the capital from talking six local businessmen (Pete Grammar, Ted and Os Graves, Tom Heit, Jack Leach, and Cal Wilson) into investing $500 each. He then took a trip back to his home town of Winnipeg, to hire players for the 1943-44 season. \n\nThe Falcons played their first game on November 13, 1943. The St. Catharines Falcons name came from a naming contest for the new junior team. The winner of the contest was a nine-year-old boy named Jimmy Stirrett from St.Catharines Ontario. \n\nThe team was so unsuccessful, that after two years, the St. Catharines Senior \"A\" Saints folded. In 1946-47 the club didn't make the playoffs and was in financial trouble. It looked like the end of Junior hockey in the city. In January 1947, George Stauffer, President of Thompson Products Ltd., stepped into the picture and bought the Falcons for $2,500. He saved Junior hockey in St. Catharines, and renamed the team the Teepees.\n\nToday there is an unrelated local Jr. B hockey team in the Golden Horseshoe Junior B Hockey League using the same name as the St. Catharines Falcons.\n\nSeveral Winnipeg-area players including Harvey Jessiman (goalie), Bing Juckes, Tom Pollock, Laurie Peterson and Doug McMurdy formed the nucleus of the first club, combined along with local players.\n\nDoug McMurdy was awarded the Red Tilson Trophy in 1944-45 as the Most Outstanding Player in the OHA.\n\nNHL alumni are Armand Delmonte, Val Delory, Bing Juckes, and Nick Mickoski.\n\nThe Falcons never made it to the league finals for the J. Ross Robertson Cup, but did very well in the regular season, making the playoffs their first three years.\n\nThe St. Catharines Falcons played in the Garden City Arena in downtown St. Catharines, Ontario from 1943-1947. The team shared the arena with the Sr. A. team, the St. Catharines Saints from 1943-1945.\n"}
