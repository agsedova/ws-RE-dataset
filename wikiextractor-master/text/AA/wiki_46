The founding members included Tim Shea on guitar and vocals, Rob Hamilton on drums, Can Keskin on guitar and bass, Steve Rzucidlo on bass, and Chris Pearson on guitar and vocals. Later the line-up would change to feature Jeff Iwanicki on bass and Greg Gilmartin on drums.\n\nThe band defied easy categorization, but the three-guitar cacophony of its music was often referred to in the subgenres of noise rock, post punk, no wave, and even industrial music. After releasing a string of indie singles, the band briefly signed with Sub Pop records in 1992 and released their debut CD Blood Music, named after a science fiction novel of the same title by author Greg Bear. The album was critically acclaimed, and the bleak, dystopian nature of both the lyrics and music were compared by UK music journalists to such groups as Killing Joke, Live Skull, Gang of Four, and early Sonic Youth.\n\nAfter playing and touring extensively with both Boston-based and national acts such as The Lemonheads, Come, Galaxie 500, Dinosaur Jr., The Afghan Whigs, The Flaming Lips and The Jesus Lizard, as well as playing the second stage at Lollapalooza in 1992, the group released a CD EP titled Revisionist in 1993, and what would be their final CD, \"Illuminatus\", in 1995. After several line-up changes, GMS finally disbanded in 1997. Now regarded as a highly underrated, influential band ahead of its time, Green Magnet School is considered one of the seminal indie rock groups that sprouted from the fertile, post-grunge Boston music community of the late 1980s to early 1990s.\n\nThe band reunited for one night on October 7, 2004 to play a sold-out benefit/memorial show at The Middle East nightclub in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSeveral former members of the band remain currently active in ongoing musical projects including Black Helicopter, Ekranoplan, Low-Country Messiahs and Teleffonic (see External Links below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on August 26, 1997 by Columbia Records as the lead single from her sixth studio album \"Butterfly\" (1997). The song was written and produced by Carey, Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, Kamaal \"Q-Tip\" Fareed, and Steven \"Stevie J\" Jordan. The song samples \"Hey DJ\" by the World's Famous Supreme Team, and \"The Body Rock\" by the Treacherous Three. \"Honey\" was a re-defining song in Carey's career, pushing her further into the hip hop music world.\n\n\"Honey\" was acclaimed by music critics, who called Carey's musical transition \"genuine\". \"Honey\" was successful in the United States, becoming Carey's third single to debut atop the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, a feat that has yet to be duplicated. The single stayed at number one for three consecutive weeks. \"Honey\"\nhit the top-five in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and the United Kingdom, the top-ten in Australia and Sweden, and the top 20 in the majority of charts worldwide. \"Honey\" was nominated in two categories at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. Carey included the song in the set-list of various live shows and future tours, where she would sing both the original and remix versions.\n\n\"Honey\" is well known for its accompanying music video, which presented a more sexual and less conservative image of Carey than had been previously seen. The video features Carey being held hostage in a mansion, which she escapes in a James Bond-themed plot. Subsequent scenes see Carey escaping her assailants on a watercraft, dancing aboard a ship with sailors, and frolicking on a beautiful island with her lover. The video garnered much coverage, as many comparisons were made between the video and the rumors of Carey's failing marriage. While Carey denied the comparisons were anything more than coincidence, many close friends including Walter Afanasieff, Carey's writing partner, felt they were more than obvious.\n\nAfter the success of her urban crossover album \"Daydream,\" Carey began exerting more control over the creative aspects of her career. In doing so, she began pursuing a more hip-hop oriented sound, something very different from anything she had recorded previously. However, she was still writing ballads with Afanasieff, but began looking for more hip-hop/R&B producers to helm part of her new project. Carey began working on the song, recorded in February 1997, with Q-Tip. They brought the lyrics, samples and melody over to Puff Daddy who, as a producer, had just earned his second number one single on the Hot 100 with \"Mo Money Mo Problems.\" Due to rumors of Puffy's overbearing nature, Carey recorded her vocals separately, until she gave him a few demos to choose from. Puffy explained why Carey recorded her vocals separately, and his feelings regarding having worked with her:\n\nA lot of people feel I'm overbearing, so I wasn't allowed in the studio when she did her vocals. I'm trying to work on that, I'm such a perfectionist, sometimes I don't give people the chance to breathe. So I've been banned from a lot of studios. Mariah [recorded \"Honey\"] until she thought it was perfect, like a hundred times. She gave me like a hundred tracks to choose from.\n\nPuffy expressed his respect for Mariah and her craft, mentioning that she re-did her vocals many times until she felt they were perfect. After they had the vocals, Carey and Puffy began working on the song's hook and incorporating the music samples and blending them into the bridge and chorus. After the song was completed, Combs was very confident with the song, calling it \"slammin',\" but because of its heavy hip-hop influence, he felt only cautiously optimistic about the song's commercial success. On a more personal note, \"Honey\" served as Carey's first single after her separation from estranged husband, Tommy Mottola, who also lead her current record label, Columbia.\n\n\"Honey\" is an up-tempo song, that blends hip hop and R&B genres. The song is set in the signature common time, and is written in the key of E major. It features a basic chord progression of A-F-1. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of C to the high note of B; with the piano and guitar pieces ranging from G to G. The song's remix featured rap leads from The Lox and Mase, with some vocals rapped by Combs himself. The track was very different from anything Carey had ever recorded, and was described as \"street Hip-Hop music, with a booming bass.\" The song's melody was driven by Q-Tip's drum programming and Stevie J's keyboard notes. Combs's production gave the song a \"light and airy\" effect, further distancing it from Carey's contemporary sound. \"Honey\" featured musical samples from Treacherous Three's \"The Body Rock,\" and \"Hey DJ\" by The World's Famous Supreme Team. The track united hip-hop and R&B with traces of pop music and was described as a \"[song with a] catchy chorus, combining hip-hop and R&B into something that simply wasn't going to be denied by anyone, and offering a powerful start to a record.\" According to author Chris Nickson, \"Honey\" revealed a more confident and independent side to Carey that had never been presented in her previous work. The song truly embodied a more mature and confident woman, with sultrier lyrics and a thumping hip-hop beat to accompany it.\n\n\"Honey\" garnered acclaimed response from contemporary music critics. David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the importance the song held for Carey's musical transition. He wrote \"You're prepared for a song on which Carey finally breaks free of her adult-contemporary chains and gets down.\" He felt \"Honey\" sounded as \"anyone striking out on his or her own — caught between old and new habits and taking cautious baby steps into the future.\" Browne also commented that Carey showed a commendable vocal restraint in the song, \"showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into the downy-soft beats of \"Honey.\" Author Chris Nickson felt the single's importance was \"well beyond its chart placing\" and that the single was one of the most important songs in Carey's career, enabling her to transition into R&B and hip-hop. Nickson commented that before, Carey was seen as a pop singer with R&B tendencies, but \"Honey\" changed that idea, giving the singer \"hip-hop credibility\", and forced naysayers to \"take another look.\" Rich Juzwiak from \"Slant\" complimented the song, calling it \"awakening, both sensually and musically.\" Juzwiak concluded the review writing \"Honey exemplifies the abrupt gear shifting that appreciating Mariah the artist requires. Its new pop brilliance doesn't always come easy, where detecting it depends on the audience's newfound ability to apply Carey's pop life to her pop music.\" \"Honey\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 1998 ceremony, for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. The song did not win either nomination, a typical trend of Carey's nominations at the Grammys.\n\n\"Honey\" won many prestigious awards throughout the music industry in 1997 and 1998. The song was nominated at the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. Additionally, the song won the BMI Pop Award for \"Songwriter.\"\n\n\"Honey\" became Carey's third single to debut atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100; the most number one debuts of any artist to this day. Additionally, the song became her 12th chart topper, breaking the fifth place record she had shared with Whitney Houston and Madonna. It replaced \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" by The Notorious B.I.G. featuring Puff Daddy and Mase, and it was replaced by Boyz II Men's \"4 Seasons of Loneliness\". At this point, Carey was tied with The Supremes for fourth most US number ones, behind Michael Jackson with thirteen, and Elvis Presley and The Beatles with 17 and 20, respectively. \"Honey\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over one million units. The song stalled at number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (behind \"You Make Me Wanna...\" by Usher), spending 22 weeks in the chart. \"Honey\" finished number 32 on the \"Billboard\" end of year chart for 1997. In Canada, the song debuted on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart at forty-eight on the \"RPM\" issue dated August 18, 1997, and reached the top of the chart on September 22, 1997. It was present on the chart for a total of 20 weeks, and ranked 18 on the \"RPM\" Year-end chart for 1997.\n\nThe song debuted on the UK Singles Chart on September 6, 1997 at its peak of number three, and spent a total of eight weeks in the chart. \"Honey\" is Carey's 15th best-selling single in the United Kingdom as of 2010, with estimated sales of over 200,000. In Australia, \"Honey\" peaked at number eight on the charts, spending a total of 19 weeks in the chart. It was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 35,000 units. In New Zealand, the song peaked at number three, and stayed in the chart for 14 weeks. The song's success in most other worldwide markets was moderate, with it not reaching the same peaks as Carey's previous singles. While \"Honey\" peaked at number 12 in Finland, it fell dropped out of the chart the next week, spending a total of only one week in the chart. In Sweden, the song performed well, peaking at number eight and staying within the chart for ten weeks. In Austria and France, \"Honey\" peaked at number 39, spending one and four weeks on the charts, respectively. The song peaked at number 29 and 30 in Belgium Flanders and Wallonia.\n\nAside from the attention surrounding the song, the music video garnered much speculation. For the first time in her career, Carey was featured provocatively dressed, giving viewers a \"taste of the freer Mariah.\" The video's concept was created by Carey with Paul Hunter filling in as the director. Serving a James Bond theme, Carey was cast as \"the very sexy agent M\", a woman who escapes a large mansion in which she has been held captive. Carey said of the video that \"I don't really think the video is overtly sexual, but for me-I mean people used to think I was the nineties version of Mary Poppins!\"\n\nThe video premiered on MTV and BET in August 1997 and was shot in Puerto Rico on July 26, 1997. The video begins with Carey, playing as \"Agent M,\" being held hostage in a large mansion. The captors are played by Eddie Griffin, Frank Sivero, and Johnny Brennan of The Jerky Boys, who continue to taunt Carey over her capture and eventual death. \"Agent M\" speaks in Spanish to the captors, saying she can not understand them. After a series of dialogue, Carey escapes her Griffin's character and dives into a swimming pool from the mansion's roof. After an ensemble change, Carey dons a swimsuit and escapes the island via a watercraft. The video's antagonists continue their pursuit of Carey throughout a large body of water, until she arrives aboard a large ship. It is unclear if both scenes are happening separately or side by side. Throughout most of the video, Carey is seen posing on a large sailboat, while wearing a white bikini. After boarding the ship, Carey begins dancing and is soon joined by a group of male sailors. After a sequence of dance light dance routines, Carey is seen on an island with her lover, male model David Fumero, and her real life dog, Jack. They frolic together on the island, while Carey happily enjoys her romance.\n\nDuring the time of the video's release, Carey and Mottola were in the midst of their divorce and this led to many speculation on the video's message. Tabloids and critics were linking the video's theme to Carey's marriage, writing how Mottola would lock Carey in their mansion. While Carey denied the allegations, many found it to be very obvious. Carey's writing partner of six years, Afanasieff, felt the video was undeniably about Mottola. While speculation about the video grew, Carey continued to deny any intention of portraying her marriage in the video. In an interview, Carey said that \"Tommy loves the video, he says it's my best video yet.\"\n\nThe song's Bad Boy remix featured a different music video as well. It features the same concept, however not emphasizing on the kidnapping and escape. The video begins with Carey diving into the pool, and driving a watercraft. As she reaches a point far into the body of water, she is offered a rope lift from a helicopter. After she accepts and ascends the line, Carey boards the aircraft alongside its pilots, Puffy and the members of Bad Boy Entertainment. Other scenes sequence Carey dancing with Puffy in a golden indoor tunnel. As the video concludes, more staff from the helicopter join Carey in the golden entryway, as they dance and enjoy themselves.\n\n\"Honey\" was performed on various live television appearances as well as most of Carey's tours. Carey first performed a mash-up of the song and the Bad Boy remix live on the British music chart program \"Top of the Pops\" in 1997. The performance incorporated themes from both videos, in which Carey was dressed in the same white bikini from the music video. Additionally, the stage was set up to resemble the deck of a ship. Dancers similar to the video joined Carey on stage as she performed the song. Carey performed \"Honey\" at the 1998 World Music Awards. The performance garnered her a standing ovation, and featured many male dancers, all donning sailor costumes. After the second verse, a large projection of the Bad Boy remix video played while pre-recorded rap verses from Puffy played. A live performance of the song was taped via satellite and aired live in Japan, featuring similar costumes and themes as the others. Carey performed the song throughout her Butterfly World Tour (1998), which served as the accompanying tour for \"Butterfly.\" During her live routine of the song, various male dancers donned in similar sailor outfits joined Carey on stage. Serving as an intro to the song, Carey re-enacts the hostage from the video, and formulates her escape. The song's performance in Honolulu, Hawaii was used as the official act of the song on Carey's 1998 concert DVD, \"Around the World\", which featured live tapings from Japan, Taiwan, Australia and the US.\n\nFor her Rainbow World Tour (2000), the beginning of the original video served as the acts intro. As the music began playing, Carey emerged wearing a mini sailor suit and a matching headpiece. During the set, many male dancers joined Carey on stage, and re-enacted a similar performance than that of her previous tour. \"Honey\" was performed during Carey's following tour, the (2003–2004). The performances of the song throughout the tour were altered from those in 1997–98. The act began with the video intro like before, however the dancers featured no longer bore any resemblance to the video. Male and female dancers joined, performing traditional and exotic dance routines. Carey donned a blue one piece mini skirt, and joins with some light dance moves. Carey continued performing the song throughout her 2006 tour, The Adventures of Mimi. The performance did not include any video intro, but did introduce a four-piece of male dancers dressed in sailor outfits. Carey wore a pair of black leggings, accompanied by a sparkling mini-bra. During the performance in Madison Square Garden, Carey was joined with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs (previously known as Puffy) on stage after the second verse. During her Angels Advocate Tour (2010) performance of the song, Carey donned a sparkling mini-Herve Leger gown, with a faux-fur snug jacket. During the song, male and female dancers joined her on stage, and performed up-tempo dance routines. She performed the song regularly during The Elusive Chanteuse Show (2014), singing the So So Def Mix. She also included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency, Mariah Carey Number 1's, where she would enter the stage in a black leotard, riding a yellow jet ski, in homage to the video. Carey started performing \"Honey\" for the first time since July 2017 on her second concert residency, The Butterfly Returns (2018).\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Butterfly\" liner notes.\n\n"}

It is a variant of the public domain game President, which dates back to late Middle-Ages. The game was Awarded Best New Mind Game 1995 by Mensa, and was in Games Magazine's 1996 Games 100. The game fell out of print, but was re-released in 2005.\n\nThough based on a public domain game, the \"Dalmuti\" deck is non-standard triangular deck similar to Pairs. There is a number of each rank of cards (1 through 12) equal to that rank, so twelve 12s, eleven 11s, and so on. There are also two Jesters, which are wild cards.\n\nThe game plays best with 5 to 8 players, though more is possible. The goal is to get rid of your cards by playing grouping of the same rank, such as three 4s. The higher the rank of the card, the worse it is, with the Jester ranked as a 13 (unless played as a wildcard). You can only play a lower rank of the same number of cards as the previous player or you must pass.\n\nThe rank of the players is also important. The player in the lead after a particular hand is the \"greater dalmuti,\" and the player to his or her left is the \"lesser dalmuti.\" The player to the Great Dalmuti's right is the \"greater peon\", and the player to that player's right is the \"lesser peon.\" At \"taxation\" time before each hand, the Great Dalmuti forces an exchange of two cards from his hand with the greater peon two best cards (lowest numbered cards, always counting the Jester as 13 for this purpose), and the lesser dalmuti swaps one card with the lesser peon in a like manner. These ranks are also enforced for other aspects, such as clearing the cards after a round and sometimes getting drinks or other social aspects. The rank can change every hand, so being particularly mean to one's lessers can come back to haunt a player.\n\nIf a player gets both jester cards, he or she may call for an end to taxation (called a \"revolution\"). A game variant is that a revolution can be called by either peon with a single jester. If the greater peon has both jesters, he/she may call a \"greater revolution\" which results in all seats being swapped (so the greater peon becomes the greater dalmuti, the Lesser Peon becomes the lesser dalmuti, etc.).\n\nEach card in \"Dalmuti\" has a medieval name. Each rank is represented by an equal number of cards to its rank, except for the two Jesters.\n\nDilbert's Corporate Shuffle was a \"Dalmuti\" spinoff based on the comic strip \"Dilbert\". \"Corporate Shuffle\" used the same mechanic but was set in Dilbert's cubicle hell. The Dalmuti and Peon ranks were replaced by the Big Boss, Little Boss, Senior Intern, and Junior Intern. Taxation became Executive Bonuses, and Revolution became Corporate Takeover.\n\nThe cards have ranks 10 through 1 in those frequencies, plus two Dogbert wild cards that rank higher than all others. \"Corporate Shuffle\" also adds several special cards to the mix:\n\nWhen executive bonuses are granted to the bosses, wilds are given first, then the numerical cards in order from smallest to largest.\n\n1.

It connects several major cities and is vital for the movement of people and goods between the populous Highlands region and the coast.\n\nFor most of its length the Highlands Highway is no more than a single carriageway two-lane road which is often hindered by potholes and land slips. It is also notorious, particularly in the Highlands region, for being the place of numerous armed hold-ups and robberies committed by local bandits called raskols.\n\nThe highway begins in Lae and travels through the Markham Valley and the province of Morobe. From the Markham Valley the Highlands Highway turns left and climbs up and over the approximately 1,500 metre high Kassam Pass and into the Eastern Highlands Province. It passes over the wall of Yonki Dam and then travels through the towns of Kainantu and Henganofi to the provincial capital, Goroka. From here it travels up and then over the high Daulo Pass and crosses into Simbu Province, hence, so many gazetted roads within Chuave District link the main Okuk High Way. Teine Agiyonga Memorial Roads like; Warabago-Wiridani Road, Giriyu-Kanma Road and Giriyu-Korima Road is few amongst many and through to its capital of Kundiawa. At the Markham Valley turn-off the road continues as the Ramu Highway through the Ramu Valley into Madang Province and ends at the coast at the provincial capital of Madang.\n\nAfter Kundiawa the highway reaches the Wahgi valley, which marks the start of the Western Highlands Province. It continues through to the provincial capital of Mount Hagen and then at a village called Togoba, it splits. A southern branch continues on to the Southern Highlands province and its capital of Mendi before going on to Tari. The other branch goes to Enga province and its capital of Wabag before ending at the mining town of Porgera.\n\nIn 2006 the eastern section of the highway (Lae-Goroka) was resurfaced by the Australian government AusAid Program. Several Japanese and Taiwanese projects have contributed to rebuilding or replacement of important bridges. The Porgera Gold Mine (PJV) is a major user of the Highlands Highway for transport of all its consumables and equipment from Lae port, and consequently spends an enormous amount of time and money on maintaining the road – most often the portion from Mt Hagen to Porgera – upgrading cuttings, bridges and culverts.\n\nThe highway is subject to frequent landslides and washouts. In April 2008, the section of the highway passing through Simbu Province was impassable at three separate points over different periods. The most serious of these destroyed a 150-metre section of the highway at Gera village, 10 km east of Kundiawa, on 11 April; this cut off the upper Highlands provinces from all road transport.\n"}

In such \"reeducation camps\", the government imprisoned up to 300,000 former military officers, government workers and supporters of the former government of South Vietnam as well as civilians, except some famous ARVN generals who committed suicide shortly after hearing President Duong Van Minh surrendered. Other estimates put the number of inmates as high as 500,000 to 1 million. Reeducation as it was implemented in Vietnam was seen as both a means of revenge and a sophisticated technique of repression and indoctrination, which developed following the 1975 Fall of Saigon. Thousands were tortured and abused. Prisoners were incarcerated for as long as 17 years, with most terms ranging from three to 10 years.\n\nThe term \"reeducation\", with its pedagogical overtones, does not quite convey the quasi-mystical resonance of \"trại học tập cải tạo\" in Vietnamese. \"Cải\" (\"to transform\", from Sino-Vietnamese 改) and \"tạo\" (\"to create\", from Sino-Vietnamese 造) combine to literally mean an attempt at re-creation, and making over sinful or incomplete individuals.\n\nIn South Vietnam, the government of Ngo Dinh Diem countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political reeducation centers.\" This was a ruthless program that incarcerated many non-communists, although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time. The North Vietnamese government claimed that over 65,000 individuals were incarcerated and 2,148 individuals were killed in the process by November 1957, although these figures may be exaggerated.\n\nAfter the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese men, from former officers in the armed forces, to religious leaders, to employees of the Americans or the old government, were rounded up in re-education camps to \"learn about the ways of the new government.\" They were never tried, judged or convicted of any crime. Many South Vietnamese men chose to flee on boats, but others had established lives and loved ones in Vietnam, so they did not flee, but entered these camps in hope of quickly reconciling with the new government and continuing their lives peacefully. Some ARVN generals and officers, such as General Lê Văn Hưng (known as hero of fighting for three months at An Loc) and General Nguyễn Khoa Nam (the last major general of IV Corps) who protect Can Tho and other Mekong provinces to keep under control of higher army morale, chose to sacrificed by suicide rather than fleeing overseas or risking for re-education camp.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who were imprisoned in re-education camps from 1975 basically fell into two categories:\n1) Those who were detained in re-education camps from 1975 because they collaborated with the other side during the war, and \n2) Those who were arrested in the years after 1975 for attempting to exercise such democratic freedoms as those mentioned in Article 11 of the 1973 Paris Agreements.\nIn other words, both categories of prisoners were held in direct violation of Article 11 of the 1973 Paris Agreements, an international treaty, and therefore of international law.\n\nOfficially, the Vietnamese government does not consider the reeducation camps to be prisons; instead, it views them as places where individuals can be rehabilitated into society through education and socially constructive labor.\n\nThe Hanoi government defended the reeducation camps by placing the \"war criminal\" label on the prisoners. A 1981 memorandum of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to Amnesty International claimed that all those in the reeducation camps were guilty of acts of national treason as defined in Article 3 of the 30 October 1967 Law on Counter-revolutionary Crimes (enacted for the government of North Vietnam), which specifies punishments ranging from 20 years to life in prison or the death penalty. However, it was instead allowing the prisoners to experience \"reeducation,\" which is applied in Vietnam because Vietnam says it is the most \"humanitarian\" system and because it is the most advantageous punishment for law breakers.\n\nIn May 1975, specific groups of Vietnamese were ordered to register with the new government that had established control over\nthe South on April 30, 1975. Then, in June, the new government issued orders instructing those who had registered in May to report to various places for reeducation. Soldiers, noncommissioned officers and rank-and-file personnel of the former South\nVietnamese government were to undergo a three-day \"reform study,\" June 11–13, which they would attend during the day and they would go home at night.\n\nThe others who had been ordered to report for \"reform study\" were not allowed the same arrangement of attending during the day and going home at night, but were instead to be confined to their sites of \"reform study\" until the course ended. Nevertheless, there was some hope, for the government gave the clear impression that reform study would last no more than a month for even the highest-ranking officers and officials of the former government in South Vietnam, and ten days for lower-ranking officers and officials.\n\nThus, officers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces from the rank of second lieutenant to captain, along with low-ranking police officers and intelligence cadres, were ordered to report to various sites, bringing along \"enough paper, pens, clothes, mosquito nets, personal effects, food or money to last ten days beginning from the day of their arrival.\" High-ranking military and police officers of the ARVN, from major to general, along with mid and high-ranking intelligence officers, members of the ARVN executive, judicial and legislative branches, including all elected members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and, finally, leaders of \"reactionary\" (i.e. non-communist) political parties in South Vietnam, were ordered to report to various sites bringing enough \"paper, pens, clothes, mosquito-nets, personal effects, food or money to last a month beginning from the day of their first meeting.\"\n\nThe new government announced that there would be three days of reeducation for ARVN soldiers, ten days for low-ranking officers and officials, and one month for high-ranking ARVN officers and officials. Many teachers reported for reeducation, assuming that they would have to undergo it sooner or later anyway. Sick people also reported for reeducation, assured by the government that there would be doctors and medical facilities in the schools and that the patients would be well treated. However, the re-education camp lasted sometimes more than 10 years for some higher ranks ARVN generals and officers. \n\nDuring the early phase of reeducation, lasting from a few weeks to a few months, inmates were subjected to intensive political indoctrination. Subjects' studies included the exploitation by American imperialism of workers in other countries, the glory of labor, the inevitable victory of Vietnam, led by the Communist Party, over the U.S., and the generosity of the new government toward the \"rebels\" (those who fought on the other side during the war). Another feature emphasized during the early stage of reeducation, but continued throughout one's imprisonment, was the confession of one's alleged misdeeds in the past. All prisoners in the camps were required to write confessions, no matter how trivial their alleged crimes might have been. Some prisoners of former ARVN generals wrote a confessions about several battle and military campaign tactics before 1975. Mail clerks, for example, were told that they were guilty of aiding the \"puppet war machinery\" through circulating the mail, while religious chaplains were found guilty of providing spiritual comfort and encouragement to enemy troops.\n\nIn the reeducation camps much emphasis was placed on \"productive labor.\" Such labor was described by SRV spokesman Hoang Son as \"absolutely necessary\" for reeducation because \"under the former government, they (the prisoners) represented the upper strata of society and got rich under U.S. patronage. They could scorn the working people. Now the former social order has been turned upside down, and after they have finished their stay in camps they have to earn their living by their own labour and live in a society where work is held in honor.\" Thus, in the eyes of the Vietnamese rulers, \"productive labor\" was a necessary aspect in the overturning of the social order. Yet in examining the conditions under which this labor took place, it seems that there was also an element of revenge.\n\nThe labor was mostly hard physical work, some of it very dangerous, such as mine field sweeping. No technical equipment was provided for this extremely risky work, and as a result, many prisoners were killed or wounded in mine field explosions. Other kinds of work included cutting trees, planting corn and root crops, clearing the jungle, digging wells, latrines and garbage pits, and constructing barracks within the camp and fences around it. The inmates were generally organized into platoons and work units, where they were forced to compete with each other for better records and work achievements. This often pushed inmates to exhaustion and nervousness with each person and group striving to surpass or at least fulfill the norms set by camp authorities, or they would be classified as 'lazy' and ordered to do 'compensation work' on Sundays. North Vietnamese children were brought in to routinely pester prisoners, teenage girls stomping on the bare feet of former ARVN army officers as they marched to work. Sometimes prisoners who missed their quota were shackled and placed in solitary confinement cells.\n\nDeaths from starvation and disease occurred frequently and bodies were often buried in graves on site which were later abandoned. The work was done in the hot tropical sun, by prisoners who were poorly nourished and received little or no medical care. The poor health, combined with hard work, mandatory confessions and political indoctrination, made life very difficult for prisoners in Vietnam, and contributed to a high death rate in the camps. Former prisoners describe the constant hunger that resulted from a lack of food while they were in the camps. The government deliberately kept the prisoners on low rations. The lack of food caused severe malnutrition for many prisoners and weakened their resistance to various diseases. Most common among the diseases were malaria, beriberi and dysentery. Tuberculosis was also widespread in some of the camps. Medical supplies were generally nonexistent in the camps and medical care was very inadequate, usually limited to a poorly trained medic and perhaps a few prisoners who had formerly been medical doctors. The result was a high death rate from diseases.\n\nThe authorities sought to maintain strict control over the thoughts of the prisoners, and forbade prisoners from keeping and reading books or magazines of the former government, reminiscing in conversation about \"imperialism and the puppet south,\" singing old patriotic and love songs from the former government, discussing political questions (outside authorized discussions), harboring \"reactionary\" thoughts or possessing \"superstitious\" beliefs.\n\nIt has been acknowledged by Hanoi that violence has in fact been directed against the prisoners, although it maintains that these are isolated cases and not indicative of general camp policy. Former prisoners, on the other hand, report frequent beatings for minor infractions, such as missing work because of illness. Violations of rules led to various forms of punishment, including being tied up in contorted positions, shackled in conex boxes or dark cells, forced to work extra hours or receiving reduced food rations. Many prisoners were beaten, some to death, or subjected to very harsh forms of punishment due to the cruelty of certain camp officials and guards. Some were executed, especially for attempting to escape. It was also forbidden to be impolite to the cadres of the camp, and this rule was sometimes abused to the point where the slightest indication of a lack of deference to the cadres had been interpreted as rudeness and was therefore harshly punished.\n\nLongtime anti-Vietnam war and human rights activist Ginetta Sagan described conditions in the camps in 1982:\nDuring the last three years friends and I have interviewed several hundred former prisoners, read newspaper articles on the camps as well as various reports of Amnesty International, and have studied official statements from the Vietnamese Government and its press on the re-education camps. The picture that emerges is one of severe hardship, where prisoners are kept on a starvation diet, overworked and harshly punished for minor infractions of camp rules. We know of cases where prisoners have been beaten to death, confined to dark cells or in ditches dug around the perimeters of the camps and executed for attempting escape. A common form of punishment is confinement to the CONEX boxes—air-freight containers that were left behind by the United States in 1975. The boxes vary in size; some are made of wood and others of metal. In a CONEX box 4 feet high and 4 feet wide, for example, several prisoners would be confined with their feet shackled, and allowed only one bowl of rice and water a day. \"\"It reminded me of the pictures I saw of Nazi camp inmates after World War II\",\" said a physician we interviewed who witnessed the release of four prisoners who had been confined to a CONEX box for one month. None of them survived.\"\n\nAs of 1980, official regulations stated that prisoners in the camps could be visited by their immediate family once every three months. Family visits were important not only because of the personal need for prisoners and their loved ones to have contact with each other but also because the families could bring food to their relatives in some of the camps. It has been reported that the prisoners in these camps would not have survived without such food. The duration of the visits was not long, reported by former prisoners to last from 15 to 30 minutes. Moreover, family visits would be suspended for prisoners who broke the rules, and it has also been said that only families who had proven their loyalty to the government were allowed visiting privileges.\n\nMost former prisoners who were interviewed have been in between three and five different reeducation camps. It is believed that the movement of prisoners from one camp to another was intended to prevent both the inmates and their relatives from knowing a specific camp's real location. That way, escapes from prison could be prevented, and prisoners' relatives could be prevented from visiting them.\n\nIn June 1976, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, in one of its last policy announcements before the official reunification of Vietnam, stated that those in the camps would either be tried or released after three years of imprisonment. But this promise was broken. The policy announced that those still in the camps would stay there for three years, but they would be released early if they made \"real progress, confess their crimes and score merits\".\n\nSince there were no clear criteria for releasing the inmates from the camps, bribery and family connections with high-ranking officials were more likely to speed up release than the prisoner's good behavior. Released prisoners were put on probation and placed under surveillance for six months to one year, and during that time they had no official status, no exit visas, no access to government food rations and no right to send their children to school. If the progress of the former prisoners was judged unsatisfactory during this period, they could be fired from their jobs, be put under surveillance for another six months to a year, or be sent back to the reeducation camps. Faced with these challenges, many chose to flee the country and became boat people.\n\nSome prisoners who had been imprisoned since the Fall of Saigon were released as recently as the year 2000. \" It also said that some Vietnamese would be brought to trial, including those who deserted the NLF during the war, those who owed \"many blood debts\" to the people and those who fled to \"foreign countries with their U.S. masters.\"\n\nThe U.S. government considers re-education camp inmates to be political prisoners. In 1989, the Reagan administration entered into an agreement with the Vietnamese government, pursuant to which Vietnam would free all former ARVN soldiers and officials held in re-education camps and allow them to emigrate to the United States. Thus began the third large influx of Vietnamese immigrants into the country.\n\nThe Vietnamese American Foundation began a program called \"The Returning Casualty\" in early 2006. It attempts to locate the graves of people who died in the camps, identify their remains and deliver them to their loved ones.\n\n\n\n"}

Mdewakanton, pronounced Mid-ah-wah-kah-ton, means \"dwellers at the spirit waters.\"\n\nThe tribe owns and operates Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, Little Six Casino, and a number of other enterprises. While Scott County is largely rural, it is located within the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. This helps it draw from a large population to attract numerous customers for its enterprises.\n\nThe SMSC presently owns approximately of land, all of which are located within or near the original reservation established for the Tribe in the 1880s. Tribal lands are located in Prior Lake and Shakopee, Minnesota.\nTribal members are direct lineal descendants of Mdewakanton Dakota people who resided in villages near the banks of the lower Minnesota River. A line of leaders known as Chief Sakpe were spokesmen for their village. The first Sakpe [pronounced Shock-pay], meaning \"six,\" was named by his people as such after his wife bore sextuplets. The second Sakpe, also known as the Eaglehead, was one of twin sons of an Ojibwe chief, who gave him to this band so that they might have a leader, and he was adopted by the first Sakpe as his son. He signed several treaties with the US during the 19th century.\n\nThe City of Shakopee later developed near this site and was named for these prominent leaders. The town of Shakopee was named after Sakpe as well.\n\nThe SMSC is governed by the General Council, consisting of all enrolled SMSC members ages 18 and older. The Business Council consists of three members elected every four years by the General Council. The Business Council is responsible for day-to-day operations of the tribe/reservation and implementing General Council decisions. The present Business Council consists of Chairman Keith Anderson, Vice-Chairman Cole Miller, and Secretary/Treasurer Rebecca Crooks-Stratton.\n\nThe Dakota people have lived in the Minnesota River Valley for centuries. Historically they fished in the river, gathered wild rice from river's edge beds, as well as nuts and roots, and hunted game.\n\nChief Sakpe (Shock-pay), which means \"number six\" in the Dakota language, was the name of a line of chiefs of a village in this area. The city of Shakopee later developed near this site and was named for the chiefs. Chief Sakpe I ( 1750 – 1827) received the name \"Sakpe\" because his wife gave birth to sextuplet boys. Chief Sakpe II () signed the 1851 Treaties with the United States on behalf of the Dakota at Traverse Des Sioux and Mendota; he traveled to Washington, DC to sign the 1858 Treaty on behalf of the Dakota.\n\nChief Sakpe III (1811–1865) was a leader during the US-Dakota War of 1862. When the Dakota people were exiled after the war, Sakpe fled to Canada. Later he was turned over to U.S. forces. Reportedly as he was preparing to be hanged on November 11, 1865, he heard a train whistle and said, \"As the white man comes in, the Indian goes out.\"\n\nWhen European-American settlers migrated into their territory in the 1800s, the Dakota people did not have a concept of permanent and exclusive ownership of land. Their conception of land use was that different peoples might live on it and share its resources. The era of settlement in Minnesota was accompanied by the United States forcing the Dakota to cede land forever, diminishing their homeland and their ability to continue their traditional way of life. The new settlers disrupted hunting grounds and restricted fishing on \"their\" lands. Unable to hunt, fish and gather resources adequately, the Dakota were forced to depend increasingly on the federal government's promises and provisions, often late or spoiled. The federal government's failure to deliver on these promises brought near-starvation and growing anger among the Dakota. Their resentment broke out in the US-Dakota War of 1862.\n\nThe US Army suppressed and defeated the Dakota warriors. It conducted the largest mass execution in United States history, executing by hanging 38 Dakota men in Mankato, Minnesota, on December 26, 1862. The remaining Dakota were forced to walk more than 100 miles to Fort Snelling, where they were held in a concentration camp through the winter. In 1863 Congress rescinded all treaties with the Dakota and ordered their removal from Minnesota.\n\nFinally, in 1886, Congress established the Shakopee Mdewakanton Reservation, Prairie Island Indian Community Reservation, Upper Sioux Indian Reservation, and Lower Sioux Indian Reservation for the Dakota who never left Minnesota. But for the next century, life for the Dakota people was one of poverty and hardship.\n\nIn 1969 the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community gained federal recognition as a tribe. They created a government and developed an economic system. In 1982 the tribe opened Little Six Bingo Palace (later Little Six Casino) after Indian gaming was allowed on reservation lands in states that had gaming laws. In 1992 it opened the Mystic Lake Casino Hotel. These enterprises have generated revenues that the tribe has invested in other economic development, tribal welfare, and philanthropy.\n\nThe SMSC Gaming Enterprise includes Little Six Casino and Mystic Lake Casino Hotel. With a total of 4,100 employees, the SMSC, Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, and Little Six Casino combined make up the largest employer in Scott County.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, the SMSC and Canterbury Park, a horse racing track, announced a ten-year cooperative marketing agreement. The agreement called for the SMSC Gaming Enterprise to create the Mystic Lake Purse Enhancement Fund, which would increase horse racing purses at Canterbury Park by $75 million over the ten years. Edward Stevenson, CEO of the SMSC Gaming Enterprise announced that the agreement would also create new joint marketing opportunities between Canterbury Park and Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, with the Park receiving $8.5 million in payments for these marketing ventures over the course of the agreement. The Mystic Lake Derby was established in 2012 as a new purse race, and the Mystic Lake Mile in 2013. Prior to the start of the 2013 race season, a new tote board was erected at the racetrack.\n\nThe SMSC also has retail and other business enterprises, including Dakota Mall, Dakotah Meadows Mini Storage, Dakotah Meadows RV Park, Dakotah! Ice Center, Dakotah! Sport and Fitness, Wozupi Tribal Gardens, Mazopiya (natural food market), Mystic Lake Store at Mall of America in Bloomington, Playworks, Playworks LINK Event Center, Shakopee Dakota Convenience Stores #1 and #2, SMSC Organics Recycling Facility, SMSC Water Bottling Facility, and The Meadows at Mystic Lake (golf course).\n\nThe tribe also owns the JW Marriott Minneapolis Mall of America, a 15-level luxury hotel that opened in 2015.\n\nMystic Lake Center is the newest addition to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel. The 70,000-square-foot meeting and event space accommodates groups of all sizes for a range of meetings and events – from business meetings to holiday parties to conferences and expos to weddings. Mystic Lake Center features a nine-story, 180-room hotel tower; three large ballrooms with flexible layouts; several smaller meeting rooms and an executive conference room; and plenty of natural light and stunning golf course views.\n\nGuided by the Dakota tradition of helpfulness, the SMSC is committed to sharing its resources. The tribe has donated more than $350 million to organizations and causes, and is the single-largest philanthropic benefactor for Indian Country nationally.\n\nIn 2015, the SMSC launched Seeds of Native Health, a five-year, $11 million campaign that represents the single-largest coordinated philanthropic effort in American history focused on improving Native American nutrition.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the tribe’s latest charitable campaign is Understand Native Minnesota, a three-year, $5 million strategic philanthropic initiative to improve the Native American narrative in Minnesota schools. \n\nIn addition to charitable giving, the tribe has provided $500 million in economic development loans to fellow tribes. The SMSC made a $31 million loan to Red Lake Nation in 2010, and a $27 million loan in 2013, the latter so that the Red Lake Tribe could construct and operate a gaming casino to generate revenues.\n\n\n"}

Essentially, a company uses income from advertising placed on members' screens to pay them for time spent browsing the web.\n\nA PTS company would provide a smaller program to be installed on a member's computer. Advertisers' banner ads were then displayed while the member was browsing the web. Since the company's Viewbar software tracked websites that the user visited, the PTS company was able to deliver targeted ads for their advertisers. Advertisers paid the company a small amount (typically US$0.50) for every hour of a member's surfing.\n\nMembers were usually limited on the amount of time per month for which they would be paid to surf (typically 20 hours). However, PTS companies also paid their members for each new user referred to the company (typically US$0.05 - US$0.10 per recruit). Thus, it was profitable for a member to garner as many referrals as possible, encouraging some users to recruit members using spam, though officially forbidden by the user's agreement. Minors, many of whom flocked to these business models as an easy source of income, were required to obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian.\n\nThe most well-known PTS company was AllAdvantage. It launched in March 1999 and grew to 13 million members in little over a year with the multi-level marketing system of recruiting new members. The scheme capitalized on the notion that anyone could make money on the internet without much effort.\n\nAllAdvantage’s success attracted many imitators. At its peak, there were several dozen pay-to-surf companies. AllAdvantage had US$175 million in venture capital; its imitators did not have this backing, and their members were never more than a small fraction of AllAdvantage's. \n\nAfter 18 months, AllAdvantage ceased operations. At that point, AllAdvantage had paid out over US$160 million to its members. Many members of smaller PTS companies were never paid when the companies shut down.\n\nBy late 2001, with the dot-com bubble's collapse, very few PTS companies remained. This is not surprising since 100% of the revenue came from internet advertising, which was the area hardest hit.\n\nAs with many Internet business models, PTS companies attracted people trying to defraud the company out of money. The companies had to deal with spammers, often having to terminate member accounts. Software utilities started appearing which allowed users to simulate surfing activity. Some users even created mechanical mouse-moving devices which ran around their desks, i.e. \"JiggyMouse\". These programs and devices allowed users to get paid simply for leaving their computers on. This began an arms race between the PTS companies who built fraud-prevention software and fraud program developers, with each releasing increasingly sophisticated versions of their software.\n\nToday, there are still few surviving PTS companies but these are often rewards-based wherein users are given reward points, which can be exchanged for gifts, when surfing the web or doing tasks such as answering marketing email and shopping at specific stores. Another version rehashed the concept as \"pay-you-for-your-attention\" scheme wherein an Internet user is paid in exchange for the surfing interruption or paid in exchange for information about themselves and their Internet habits. A web browser called Brave is also offering income-sharing feature with its users who opt to view its advertisements. It was designed by JavaScript creator Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy.\n\n"}

They eat small fruit and berries, particularly mistletoe (Loranthaceae). Some species may also eat some insects.\n\nEuphonias were once considered members of the tanager family, Thraupidae. A molecular phylogenetic study of the finch family Fringillidae published in 2012 included 9 species from the genus \"Euphonia\" and a single species from the genus \"Chlorophonia\", the blue-naped chlorophonia. The resulting cladogram showed the blue-naped chlorophonia nested within the \"Euphonia\" clade implying that the genus \"Euphonia\" is paraphyletic.\nThe genus was introduced in 1806 by the French zoologist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in his \"Histoire naturelle des tangaras, des manakins et des todiers\" with the white-vented euphonia as the type species.\n\nA taxonomic analysis published in 2020 found that the genus \"Euphonia\" was paraphyletic with respect to \"Chlorophonia\". To resolve the paraphyly the authors of the study proposed the resurrection of the genus \"Cyanophonia\" that had been introduced in 1851 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte. They suggested that the Antillean euphonia (\"Cyanophonia musica\") should be the type species. The proposed genus would contain three species: the Antillean euphonia, the golden-rumped euphonia and the elegant euphonia. An alternative and simpler way to resolve the paraphyly would be move the three species from \"Euphonia\" into \"Chlorophonia\". \n\nThe genus contains 27 species:\n\nThe black-throated euphonia (\"\"Euphonia vittata\"\") is now thought to be a hybrid between the chestnut-bellied euphonia and the orange-bellied euphonia.\n\n"}

The rice planting was done at a strategically important time of the year when the rains came. Channels were dug like the rice fields Dencker-Rasmussen had seen in Malaysia many years before, resulting in successful crops. Rice had previously been brought in from outside and eventually became one of the important alternative staple diets for the region instead of the sweet potato and maize traditionally used. \n"}
{"id": "1847412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847412", "title": "Christian meditation", "text": "Christian meditation\n\nChristian meditation is a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to become aware of and reflect upon the revelations of God. The word meditation comes from the Latin word \"meditārī\", which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study, and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God. \n\nChristian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.\n\nChristian meditation involves looking back on Jesus' life, thanksgiving and adoration of God for his action in sending Jesus for human salvation. In her book \"The Interior Castle\" (Mansions 6, Chapter 7) Saint Teresa of Avila defined Christian meditation as follows:\nBy meditation I mean prolonged reasoning with the understanding, in this way. We begin by thinking of the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; and we do not stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.\n\nQuoting the Gospel of Matthew: \"No one knows the Father but only the Son and anyone whom the Son wants to reveal him\" and I Corinthians: \"But we have received the Spirit who is from God so that we may realize what God has freely given us\", theologian Hans von Balthasar explained the context of Christian meditation as follows:\nThe dimensions of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking out of his own, and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.\nBuilding on that theme, E. P. Clowney explained that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The first is that Christian meditation is grounded in the Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the \"love of\" God, as in I John : \"We love, for he first loved us\". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible and the love of God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in \"praise\".\n\nThomas Merton characterized the goal of Christian meditation as follows: \"The true end of Christian meditation is practically the same as the end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ.\" While Protestants view salvation in terms of \"faith and grace alone\" (i.e. sola fide and sola gratia) both Western and Eastern Christians see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption. Apostle Paul stated in Epistle to the Romans that salvation only comes from \"God that hath mercy\". The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of give and take, and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God. The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects of love that please God: obedience and adoration. The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.\n\nIn Western Christian teachings, meditation is usually believed to involve the inherent action of the Holy Spirit to help the meditating Christian understand the deeper meanings of the Word of God. In the 12th century, decades before Guigo II's the \"Ladder of the Monk\", one of his predecessors, Guigo I, emphasized this belief by stating that when earnest meditation begins, the Holy Spirit enters the soul of the meditator, \"turns water into wine\" and shows the path towards contemplation and a better understanding of God.\n\nIn the 19th century, Charles Spurgeon affirmed this belief within the Protestant tradition and wrote: \"The Spirit has taught us in meditation to ponder its message, to put aside, if we will, the responsibility of preparing the message we've got to give. Just trust God for that.\" In the 20th century, Hans Urs von Balthasar paraphrased this teaching as follows:\nThe vistas of God's Word unfold to the meditating Christian solely through the gift of the Divine Spirit. How could we understand what is within God and is disclosed to us except through the Spirit of God who is communicated to us? \nAs a biblical basis for this teaching, von Balthasar referred to : \"these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God\".:\n\nChristian meditation is generally held to be distinct from the styles of meditations performed in Eastern religions (such as Buddhism) or in the context of the New Age. While other types of meditation may suggest approaches to disengage the mind, Christian meditation aims to fill the mind with thoughts related to Biblical passages or Christian devotions. Although some mystics in both the Western and Eastern churches have associated feelings of ecstasy with meditation, (e.g. St. Teresa of Avila's legendary meditative ecstasy), St. Gregory of Sinai, one of the originators of Hesychasm, stated that the goal of Christian meditation is \"seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, beyond the minor phenomenon of ecstasy\".\n\nModern Christian teachings on meditation at times include specific criticism of the transcendental styles of meditation, e.g. John Bertram Phillips stated that Christian meditation involves the action of the Holy Spirit on Biblical passages and warned of approaches that \"disengage the mind\" from scripture. According to Edmund P. Clowney, Christian meditation contrasts with cosmic styles of oriental meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with discussions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings. Unlike eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations are intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. According to Clowney it is the search for wisdom, not ecstasy, that marks the path of Christian meditation, a wisdom sought in the \"Christ of Scripture and the Scripture of Christ\".\n\nA 1989 document generally known as \"Aspects of Christian meditation\" set forth the position of the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a \"flight from the self\", can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.\n\nSome authors, however, have emphasized similarities between Christian meditation and non-Christian meditation. Psychologist Daniel Goleman gives an overview of many styles of meditation in \"The Varieties of the Meditative Experience\", and includes a section on what he believes are key commonalities (as well as differences); he argues that all share the goal of the cultivation of attention. Thomas Merton, an American Catholic monk, believed Christianity had forsaken its mystical tradition in favor of Cartesian emphasis on rationality and concepts. Eastern traditions, for Merton, were mostly untainted by this type of thinking and thus had much to offer in terms of how to think of and understand oneself. Having studied the Desert Fathers and other Christian mystics, Merton found many parallels between the language of these Christian mystics and the language of Zen philosophy. This said, Merton felt non-Christian religions had little or nothing to contribute in terms of doctrine.\n\nIn the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: \"hāgâ\" (), which means \"to sigh\" or \"murmur\", but also \"to meditate\", and \"sîḥâ\" (), which means \"to muse\", or \"rehearse in one's mind\". When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, \"hāgâ\" became the Greek \"melete\" which emphasized meditation's movement in the depth of the human heart. \"Melete\" was a reminder that one should never let meditation be a formality. The Latin Bible then translated \"hāgâ\"/\"melete\" into \"meditatio\".\n\nThe Bible mentions \"meditate\" or \"meditation\" 23 times, 19 times in the Book of Psalms alone. When the Bible mentions meditation, it often mentions obedience in the next breath. An example is the Book of Joshua: \"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success..\"\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.\nThe progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century. Guigo II's book \"The Ladder of Monks\" is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition. \n\nIn Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of \"constant prayer\" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book \"The Ladder of Divine Ascent\" by the 7th century. These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century.\n\nThe methods of \"methodical prayer\" as taught by the \"Devotio Moderna\" group in northern Europe had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century. The book \"The Imitation of Christ\" which was known in Spain as \"Contemptus mundi\" became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied. Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, John of the Cross continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina. By the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had also been firmly established in the Protestant spiritual tradition.\n\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, some components of meditation had started to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity. However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.\n\nIn 1965, one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution \"Dei verbum\" (Latin for \"Word of God\"), emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of \"Dei verbum\" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.\n\nA number of saints and historical figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The \"Spiritual Exercises\" of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, with the goal of knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues to be used in the Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.\n\nThe \"Spiritual Exercises\" of St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556), the founder of the Jesuits, contain numerous meditative exercises. To this day, the Spiritual Exercises remain an integral part of the Novitiate training period of the Roman Catholic religious order of Jesuits.\n\nThe exercises are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through an experience of Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with a consideration of the purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.\n\nThe exercises often involve imagery in which one enters a biblical scene. For example, the practitioner is encouraged to visualize and meditate upon scenes from the life of Christ, at times asking questions from Christ on the cross, during crucifixion.\n\nSt. Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative prayer for periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa believed that no one who was faithful to the practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul. Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.\n\nSt. Teresa taught her nuns to meditate on specific prayers. Her prayers described in\n\"The Way of Perfection\" involve meditation on a mystery in the life of Jesus and are based on the faith that \"God is within\", a truth that Teresa said she learned from St. Augustine.\n\nIn her \"Life\", she wrote that she taught herself from the instructions given in the book, \"The Third Spiritual Alphabet\" - by Francisco de Osuna - which relates to Franciscan mysticism. Her starting point was the practice of \"recollection\", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray. In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God. In \"The Way of Perfection\" she wrote: \"It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God\". She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture to remind her to keep her focus. She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.\n\nSt. Theresa viewed Christian meditation as the first of four steps in achieving \"union with God\", and used the analogy of watering the garden. She compared basic meditation to watering a garden with a bucket, \"Recollection\" to the water wheel, \"Quiet\" (contemplation) to a spring of water and \"Union\" to drenching rain.\n\nEarly studies on states of consciousness by Roland Fischer found evidence of mystical experience in the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila. In her autobiography she writes that, at the peak of a praying experience \"... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place\". This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, \"Devotion of Ecstasy\", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.\n\nSaint Francis de Sales (1576–1622) used a four-part approach to Christian meditation based on \"\"preparation\"\", \"\"consideration\"\", \"\"affections and resolutions\"\" and \"\"conclusions\"\":\n\nJohn Main OSB (1926–1982) was a Benedictine monk and priest who presented a way of Christian meditation which used a prayer-phrase or mantra. This approach was then used by groups which then become the World Community for Christian Meditation.\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) said that meditation is necessary for devotion, and the Second Vatican Council called for \"faithful meditation on God's word\" as part of the spiritual formation of seminarians.\n\nSaint John of the Cross (1542–1591), a close friend of St. Teresa of Avila, viewed Christian meditation as a necessary step toward union with God, and wrote that even the most spiritually advanced persons always needed to regularly return to meditation.\n\nSaint Padre Pio (1887–1968), who was devoted to rosary meditations, said:\n\"The person who meditates and turns his mind to God, who is the mirror of his soul, seeks to know his faults, tries to correct them, moderates his impulses, and puts his conscience in order.\"\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church encourages meditation as a form of prayer: \"Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking\" (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing \"union with God\", it states: \"Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him\" (#2708). Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).\n\nChristian meditation performed with Eucharistic adoration outside the context of the Mass has inspired extensive Catholic writing and inspirational literature, especially since the 18th century. The \"Eucharistic meditations\" of Saints Pierre Julien Eymard and Jean Vianney (both promoters of the Eucharist) were published as books.\n\nSaint Thérèse of Lisieux was devoted to Eucharistic meditation and on February 26, 1895, shortly before she died, wrote from memory and without a rough draft her poetic masterpiece \"\"To Live by Love\",\" which she had composed during Eucharistic meditation.\n\nSignificant portions of the writings of the Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida were reported to have been based on her adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Similarly, in her book \"Eucharist: True Jewel of Eucharistic Spirituality\", Maria Candida of the Eucharist (who was beatified by Saint Pope John Paul II) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on Eucharistic meditation.\n\nMeditation is an integral part of the rosary. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book \"Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine\" (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.\n\nSaint Teresa of Avila's meditative approach of focusing on \"the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son\" can be viewed as the basis of most scriptural rosary meditations. In his 2002 encyclical \"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\", Saint Pope John Paul II placed the rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality. Emphasizing that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or \"transfigured\", into Christ he stated that the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ. He stated that the rosary unites us with Mary's own prayer, who, in the presence of God, prays with us and for us. and stated that: \"\"To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ.\"\"\n\nDuring the Byzantine Empire, between the 10th and 14th centuries, a tradition of prayer called hesychasm developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and continues to the present. St. Gregory of Sinai is considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer. This tradition uses a special posture and breathing rituals, accompanied by the repetition of a short prayer (traditionally the 'Jesus Prayer') giving rise to suggestions that it may have been influenced by Indian approaches. \"While some might compare it [\"hesychastic prayer\"] with a mantra, to use the Jesus Prayer in such a fashion is to violate its purpose. One is never to treat it as a string of syllables for which the 'surface' meaning is secondary. Likewise, hollow repetition is considered to be worthless (or even spiritually damaging) in the hesychast tradition.\" Rather, it is to be in the spirit of a true mantra. This style of prayer was at first opposed as heretical by Barlam in Calabria, but was defended by Saint Gregory Palamas. Coming from \"hesychia\" (\"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\"), hesychasm continues to be practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church and some other Eastern Churches of the Byzantine Rite. Hesychasm has not gained significance in the Western churches.\n\nIn hesychasm, the Jesus prayer, consisting of the phrase: \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me\" is repeated either for a set period of time or a set number of times. Hesychasm is contrasted with the more mental or imaginative forms of Christian meditation in which a person is encouraged to imagine or think of events from the life of Jesus or sayings from the Gospel. Sometimes hesychasm has been compared to the meditative techniques of oriental religions and it is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and Sufis, but this has not been proven.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847427", "title": "Team Fortress 2", "text": "Team Fortress 2\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is a multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. It is the sequel to the 1996 mod \"Team Fortress\" for \"Quake\" and its 1999 remake, \"Team Fortress Classic\". It was released as part of the video game bundle \"The Orange Box\" in October 2007 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 version followed in December 2007 when The Orange Box was ported to the system. Later in development, the game was released as a standalone title for Windows in April 2008, and was updated to support Mac OS X in June 2010 with Linux following in February 2013. It is distributed online through Valve's digital retailer Steam, with Electronic Arts handling all physical and console ports of the game.\n\nThe player can join one of two teams, RED or BLU, and choose one of 9 character classes to battle in game modes such as capture the flag and king of the hill. Development of the game was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the developers of the original \"Team Fortress\" mod. \"Team Fortress 2\" was first announced in 1998 under the name \"Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms\". Initially, the game had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay, but this changed over the protracted nine-year development. After Valve released no information for six years, \"Team Fortress 2\" regularly featured in \"Wired News\" annual vaporware list among other ignominies. The finished \"Team Fortress 2\" has cartoon-like visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, and uses Valve's Source game engine.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" received critical acclaim for its art direction, gameplay, humor, and use of character in a multiplayer-only game. Valve continues to release new content in the form of submissions made through the Steam Workshop. In June 2011, it became free-to-play, supported by microtransactions for in-game cosmetics. A 'drop system' was also added and refined, allowing free-to-play users to periodically receive game equipment and items by use of a random number generator. Though the game had an unofficial competitive scene for many years, both support for official competitive play through ranked matchmaking and an overhauled casual experience were added in July 2016.\n\nIn \"Team Fortress 2,\" two teams compete for a combat-based objective. In the game's storyline, the teams are composed of mercenaries hired by two feuding brothers to protect the company assets belonging to one brother while trying to destroy those of the other; the teams are thus represented by the names of these companies: Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU). Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with his own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. In order to accomplish objectives efficiently, a balance of these classes is required due to how these strengths and weaknesses interact with each other in a team-based environment. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier \"Team Fortress\" incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, that being one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and one melee weapon. The game was released with six official maps, although over 100 maps have since been included in subsequent updates, including competitive remakes of older maps and community-assembled maps. When players choose a gamemode for the first time, an introductory video shows how to complete its objectives. During matches, the \"Administrator\", a woman voiced by Ellen McLain, announces various game events over loudspeakers. The player limit is 16 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. On the PC, in 2008 Valve updated the game to include a server variable that allows up to 32 players.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" is the first of Valve's multiplayer games to provide detailed statistics for individual players. They include: time spent playing as each class, most points obtained, most captures or objectives achieved in a single life, and many other things. Persistent statistics tell the player how he or she is improving in relation to these statistics, such as if a player comes close to his or her record for the damage inflicted in a round. \"Team Fortress 2\" also features numerous \"achievements\" for carrying out certain tasks, such as scoring a certain number of kills or completing a round within a certain time. New sets of class-specific achievements have been added in updates, which add new abilities and weapons to each class once unlocked by the player. This unlockable system has since been expanded into a random-chance system, where the player can also obtain the items simply by playing the game.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" contains five core game modes.\n\n\nThere are several alternative game modes in \"Team Fortress 2\". These modes consist of a small amount of maps and detach from the core game modes in some way.\n\n\nMann vs Machine (MvM) is a cooperative game mode where players must defend their base from waves of robots modelled after all the nine playable classes, and slow-moving tanks carrying bombs. Robots and tanks drop credits upon their death, which players can use to buy upgrades for themselves or their weapons. The players win upon successfully defending their base from the bomb until the last wave. A paid version of this game mode called \"Mann Up\" is also available, where players buy tickets to play \"tours\", with the chance to win unique cosmetics and weapon skins upon completion.\n\nThere also exists a Training mode and a Practice mode. Training mode exists to help new players get acquainted with basic controls, and teaches them the basics of four of the nine classes. It uses wooden dummies and bots to teach players. Practice mode is just like any other multiplayer match, but only consists of the player and bots. The number of bots, their difficulty, and the map can all be adjusted to a player's preference, though not all the maps are available in training.\n\nSince 2009, there is typically also a Halloween-themed variation on one or more of the above modes during the weeks around the holiday, with maps or modes updated to include themed decorations and often a more difficult challenge to the players. For example, Halloween 2012 included an extremely difficult Mann vs. Machine round involving destroying more than 800 enemy forces. Due to popular demand of the Halloween events, Valve added Full Moon, the ability to play these events on the few days around the full moon throughout the year, and later Eternaween, the ability for players to vote to play the themed events for a two-hour block at any other time.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" features nine playable classes, categorized into the roles \"Offense\", \"Defense\", and \"Support\". Each class has strengths and weaknesses and must work with other classes to be efficient, encouraging strategy and teamwork. Each class has at least three weapons: a unique primary weapon, a common or unique secondary weapon, and a unique melee weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther characters include the Administrator (voiced by Ellen McLain), an unseen announcer who provides information about time limits and objectives to players, and her assistant Miss Pauling (Ashly Burch). The cast has expanded with Halloween updates, including the characters of Merasmus, the Bombinomicon, the Horseless Headless Horsemann, Monoculus, and the Mann Brothers (all voiced by Nolan North).\n\nIn the video announcement for the \"Jungle Inferno\" update, Mann Co. CEO Saxton Hale is voiced by JB Blanc.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" is played competitively, through multiple leagues. The North American league, ESEA, supports a paid \"Team Fortress 2\" league, with $42,000 in prizes for the top teams in 2017. \"Team Fortress 2\" is played competitively in many formats, such as Highlander (nine players per team, one of each class), 7v7 and 6v6. While formalized competitive gameplay is very different from normal \"Team Fortress 2\", it offers an environment with a much higher level of teamwork than in public servers. Most teams use voice chat to communicate, and use a combination of strategy, communication, and aiming ability to win against other teams. Community-run competitive leagues also tend to feature restrictions such as item bans and class limits. These leagues are often supported by Valve via in-game medals, which are submitted on the Steam Workshop, and announcements on the official blog.\n\nIn April 2015, Valve announced that a dedicated competitive mode would be added to \"Team Fortress 2\", utilizing skill-based matchmaking; closed beta testing began in the following year. The competitive mode was added in the \"Meet Your Match\" update, released on July 7, 2016. Ranked matches are played six-vs-six, with players ranked in thirteen tiers based on win/losses and an assessment of their skills. Ranked matchmaking will balance players based on their tiers and rating. A similar matchmaking approach has been added for casual games for matches of 12-vs-12 players. In order to join competitive matchmaking, players must have associated their Steam account with the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator, as well as having a \"Team Fortress 2\" \"premium account\", which is unlocked by either having bought the game before it went free-to-play or by having made an in-game item purchase since.\n\nThe original \"Team Fortress\" was developed by Robin Walker and John Cook as a free mod for the 1996 PC game \"Quake\". In 1998, Walker and Cook were employed by Valve, which had just released its first game, \"Half-Life.\" Valve began developing \"Team Fortress 2\" as a standalone retail game using Valve's GoldSrc engine. In 1999, Valve released \"Team Fortress Classic,\" a port of the original \"Team Fortress,\" as a free \"Half-Life\" mod. \"Team Fortress Classic\" was developed using the publicly available \"Half-Life\" software development kit as an example to the community and industry of its flexibility.\n\nIn contrast to the original \"Team Fortress,\" Valve originally planned \"Team Fortress 2\" to have a modern war aesthetic. It would feature a command hierarchy including a Commander class, parachute drops over enemy territory, networked voice communication, and numerous other innovations. The Commander class played similarly to a real-time strategy game, with the player viewing the game from a bird's-eye perspective and issuing orders to players and AI-controlled soldiers.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" was first shown at E3 1999, where Valve showcased new technologies including parametric animation, which blended animations for smoother, more lifelike movement, and Intel's multi-resolution mesh technology, which dynamically reduced the detail of distant on-screen elements to improve performance. The game earned several awards including Best Online Game and Best Action Game.\n\nIn mid-2000, Valve announced that \"Team Fortress 2\" had been delayed for a second time. They attributed the delay to development switching to an in-house engine, the Source engine. Following the announcement, Valve stopped releasing information about \"Team Fortress 2\" and the game entered six years of silent development. Walker and Cook worked on various other Valve projects; Walker was project lead on \"\" and Cook became a Steam developer. \"Team Fortress 2\" became a prominent example of vaporware, a long-anticipated game that had seen years of development, and was often mentioned alongside another much-delayed game, \"Duke Nukem Forever.\" Walker later stated that Valve built \"three to four\" different versions of \"Team Fortress 2\" before settling on their final design. Shortly before the release of \"Half-Life 2\" in 2004, Valve's marketing director Doug Lombardi confirmed that \"Team Fortress 2\" was still in development. Valve reintroduced \"Team Fortress 2\" at the July 2006 EA Summer Showcase event with a drastically different visual design\".\"\n\nDeparting from the realistic visual design of Valve games such as \"Half-Life 2\", \"\" and \"\", \"Team Fortress 2\" features a cartoon-like visual style influenced by 20th-century commercial illustrations and the artwork of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, achieved through Gooch shading. The game debuted with the Source engine's new dynamic lighting, shadowing and soft particle technologies alongside \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\". It was the first game to implement the Source engine's new Facial Animation 3 features.\n\nValve abandoned the realistic style when it became impossible to reconcile it with the unrealistic gameplay, with opposing armies having constructed elaborate bases directly next to each other. The Commander class was abandoned as players would simply refuse to follow the player's orders.\n\nValve designed each character, team, and equipped weapon to be visually distinct, even at range; for example, the coloring draws attention to the chest area, bringing focus on the equipped weapon. The voices for each of the classes were based on imagining what people from the 1960s would expect the classes to have sounded like, according to writer Chet Faliszek.\n\nThe map design has an \"evil genius\" theme with archetypical spy fortresses, concealed within inconspicuous buildings such as industrial warehouses and farms to give plausibility to their close proximities; these bases are usually separated by a neutrally themed space. The bases hide exaggerated super weapons such as laser cannons, nuclear warheads, and missile launch facilities, taking the role of objectives. The maps have little visual clutter and stylized, almost impressionistic modeling, to allow enemies to be spotted more easily. The impressionistic design approach also affects textures, which are based on photos that are filtered and improved by hand, giving them a tactile quality and giving \"Team Fortress 2\" its distinct look. The bases are designed to let players immediately know where they are. RED bases use warm colors, natural materials, and angular shapes, while BLU bases use cool colors, industrial materials, and orthogonal shapes.\n\nDuring the July 2006 Electronic Arts press conference, Valve revealed that \"Team Fortress 2\" would ship as the multiplayer component of \"The Orange Box\". A conference trailer showcasing all nine of the classes demonstrated for the first time the game's whimsical new visual style. Managing director of Valve Gabe Newell said that the company's goal was to create \"the best looking and best-playing class-based multiplayer game\". A beta release of the entire game was made on Steam on September 17, 2007, for customers who had pre-purchased \"The Orange Box\", who had activated their \"Black Box\" coupon, which was included with the ATI HD 2900XT Graphics cards, and for members of Valve's Cyber Café Program. The beta continued until the game's final release.\n\nThe game was released on October 10, 2007, both as a standalone product via Steam and at retail stores as part of \"The Orange Box\" compilation pack, priced at each gaming platform's recommended retail price. \"The Orange Box\" also contains \"Half-Life 2\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\", and \"Portal\". Valve offered \"The Orange Box\" at a ten percent discount for those who pre-purchased it via Steam before the October 10 release, as well as the opportunity to participate in the beta test.\n\nSince the release of \"Team Fortress 2\", Valve has continually released free updates and patches through Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux users; though most patches are used for improving the reliability of the software or to tweak gameplay changes, several patches have been used to introduce new features and gameplay modes, and are often associated with marketing materials such as comics or videos offered on the \"Team Fortress 2\" website; this blog is also used to keep players up to date with the ongoing developments in \"Team Fortress 2\". As of July 2012, each class has been given a dedicated patch that provides new weapons, items, and other gameplay changes; these class patches typically included the release of the class's \"Meet the Team\" video. Other major patches have included new gameplay modes including the Payload, Payload Race, Training, Highlander, Medieval, and Mann vs. Machine modes. Themed patches have also been released, such as a yearly Halloween-themed event called \"Scream Fortress\", where players may obtain unique items available only during a set period around the holiday. Other new features have given players the ability to craft items within the game from other items, trade items with other players, purchase in-game items through funds in Steam, and save and edit replay videos that can be posted to YouTube.\n\nValve has released tools to allow users to create maps, weapons, and cosmetic items through a contribution site; the most popular are added as official content for the game. This approach has subsequently created the basis for the Steam Workshop functionality of the software client. In one case, more than fifty users from the content-creation community worked with Valve to release an official content update in May 2013, with all of the content generated by these players. Valve reported that as of June 2013, over $10 million has been paid back to over 400 community members that have helped to contribute content to the game, including a total of $250,000 for the participants in the May 2013 patch. To help promote community-made features, Valve has released limited-time events, such as the \"Gun Mettle\" or \"Invasion\" events in the second half of 2015, also including the \"Tough Break\" update in December 2015, in which players can spend a small amount of money which is paid back to the community developers for the ability to gain unique items offered while playing on community-made maps during the event.\n\nDevelopment of the new content had been confirmed (but later quietly cancelled) for the Xbox 360, while development for the PlayStation 3 was deemed \"uncertain\" by Valve. However, the PlayStation 3 version of \"Team Fortress 2\" received an update that repaired some of the issues found within the game, ranging from graphical issues to online connectivity problems; this update was included in a patch that also repaired issues found in the other games within \"The Orange Box\". The updates released on PC and planned for later release on Xbox 360 include new official maps and game modes, as well as tweaks to classes and new weapons that can be unlocked through the game's achievement system. The developers attempted to negotiate with Xbox 360 developer Microsoft to keep the Xbox 360 releases of these updates free, but Microsoft refused and Valve announced that they would release bundles of several updates together to justify the price. Because of the cost of patching during the seventh generation of video game consoles, Valve has been unable to provide additional patches to the Xbox 360 version since 2009, effectively cancelling development of the console versions.\n\nOn June 10, 2010, \"Team Fortress 2\" was released for OS X, shortly after the release of Steam for OS X. The release was teased by way of an image similar to early iPod advertising, showing a dark silhouette of the Heavy on a bright green background, his Sandvich highlighted in his hand. Virtual earbuds, which can be worn when playing on either OS X or Windows once acquired, were given to players playing the game on OS X before June 14, though the giveaway period was later extended to August 16.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Valve announced the release of \"Team Fortress 2\" for Linux as part of a restricted beta launch of Steam on the platform. This initial release of Steam and \"Team Fortress 2\" was targeted at Ubuntu with support for other distributions planned for the future. Later, on December 20, 2012, Valve opened up access to the beta, including \"Team Fortress 2\", to all Steam users without the need to wait for an invitation. On February 14, 2013, Valve announced the full release of \"Team Fortress 2\" for Linux. From then to March 1, anyone who played the game on Linux would receive a free Tux penguin, which can be equipped in-game.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" was announced in March 2013 to be the first game to officially support the Oculus Rift, a consumer-grade virtual reality headset. A patch will be made to the client to include a \"VR Mode\" that can be used with the headset on any public server.\n\nIn April 2020, source code for 2018 versions \"Team Fortress 2\" and \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\" leaked online. This created fears that malicious users would use the code to make remote code execution software and attack servers or players' computers. Several fan projects halted development until the impact of the leak could be determined. Valve confirmed the legitimacy of the code leaks, but stated they do not believe it affects servers and clients running the latest official builds of either game.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, a few weeks after the death of the voice actor of the Soldier, Rick May, Valve released an update to \"Team Fortress 2\", adding a tribute to his voicework as the Soldier in the form of a new main menu theme (a rendition of Taps), as well as statues of the Soldier saluting, added to most of the official in-game maps. These statues all feature a commemorative plaque dedicated to May and will last through the end of the month.\n\nIn \"Team Fortress 2\" players can trade with other users for items such as weapons, cosmetics, weapon skins, and utilities. Weapons and utilities can change and affect gameplay in different ways, the main being that some weapons have different stats than others and thus allow a different play style. Cosmetic items, on the other hand, do not change gameplay at all and simply change an in-game character's appearance.\n\nIn late 2011, the gaming site Kotaku reported that the \"Team Fortress 2\"s trading economy was worth over $50 million. Additionally, many of the individual items have reached immense levels of real-world value, with one character hat in particular being sold for over AU$24,000 (over US$18,000).\n\nThird-party websites have been set up to help users trade, as well as track the value of the many in-game items within the Team Fortress 2 economy. Crate keys, crafting metal, and Earbuds (an in-game cosmetic item) have all been used as currency for other items such as weapons, cosmetics, and taunts due to their values.\n\nOn June 23, 2011, Valve announced that \"Team Fortress 2\" would become free to play. Unique equipment including weapons and outfits would be available as microtransactions through the in-game store, tied through Steam. Walker stated that Valve would continue to provide new features and items free. Walker stated that Valve had learned that the more players \"Team Fortress 2\" had, the more value it had for each player.\n\nThe move came a week after Valve introduced several third-party free-to-play games to Steam and stated they were working on a new free-to-play game. Within nine months of becoming free to play, Valve reported that revenue from \"Team Fortress 2\" had increased by a factor of twelve.\n\nTo promote the game, Valve released a ten-video advertisement series, \"Meet the Team\", starting in May 2007. Constructed using the game engine and using slightly more detailed character models, the series consists of short videos on individual characters, displaying their personalities and tactics. The videos are usually interspersed with clips of the character in combat in the game. The manners which these are presented have varied drastically: the first installment, \"Meet the Heavy\", depicted an interview with the gun-obsessed Russian, while \"Meet the Soldier\" showed the Soldier giving a misinformed lecture on Sun Tzu to a collection of severed heads as if to raw recruits. The videos are generally released through Valve's services, though in one notable exception, the \"Meet the Spy\" video was leaked on YouTube during the \"Sniper vs. Spy\" update week.\n\nThe \"Meet the Team\" videos are based on the audition scripts used for the voice actors for each of the classes; the \"Meet the Heavy\" script is nearly word-for-word a copy of the Heavy's script. More recent videos, such as \"Meet the Sniper\", contain more original material. The videos have been used by Valve to help improve the technology for the game, specifically improving the facial animations, as well as a source of new gameplay elements, such as the Heavy's \"Sandvich\" or the Sniper's \"Jarate\". The final video in the Meet the Team series, \"Meet the Pyro\", was released on June 27, 2012. Newell has stated that Valve is using the \"Meet the Team\" shorts as a means of exploring the possibilities of making feature film movies themselves. He believes that only game developers themselves have the ability to bring the interesting parts of a game to a film, and suggested that this would be the only manner through which a \"Half-Life\"-based movie would be made. A fifteen-minute short, \"Expiration Date\", was released on June 17, 2014. The shorts were made using Source Filmmaker, which was officially released and has been in open beta as of July 11, 2012.\n\nIn more recent major updates to the game, Valve has presented teaser images and online comic books that expand the fictional history of the \"Team Fortress 2\", as part of the expansion of the \"cross-media property\", according to Newell. In August 2009, Valve brought aboard American comic writer Michael Avon Oeming to teach Valve \"about what it means to have a character and do character development in a comic format, how you do storytelling\". \"Loose Canon\", a comic associated with the Engineer Update, establishes the history of RED versus BLU as a result of the last will and testament of Zepheniah Mann in 1890, forcing his two bickering sons Blutarch and Redmond to vie for control of Zepheniah's lands between them; both have engineered ways of maintaining their mortality to the present, waiting to outlast the other while employing separate forces to try to wrest control of the land. This and other comics also establish other background characters such as Saxton Hale, the CEO of Mann Co., the company that provides the weapons for the two sides and was bequeathed to one of Hale's ancestors by Zepheniah, and the Administrator, the game's announcer, that watches over, encourages the RED/BLU conflict, and keeps each side from winning. The collected comics were published by Dark Horse Comics in \"Valve Presents: The Sacrifice and Other Steam-Powered Stories\", a volume along with other comics created by Valve for \"Portal 2\" and \"Left 4 Dead\", and released in November 2011. Cumulative details in updates both in-game and on Valve's sites from 2010 through 2012 were part of a larger alternate reality game preceding the reveal of the Mann vs. Machine mode, which was revealed as a co-op mode on August 15, 2012.\n\nValve had provided other promotions to draw players into the game. Valve has held weekends of free play for \"Team Fortress 2\" before the game was made free-to-play. Through various updates, hats and accessories can be worn by any of the classes, giving players an ability to customize the look of their character, and extremely rare hats named \"Unusuals\" have particle effects attached to it are and are only obtainable through opening \"crates\" or trading with other players. New weapons were added in updates to allow the player to choose a loadout and play style that best suits them.\n\nHats and weapons can be gained as a random drop, through the crafting/trading systems, or via cross-promotion: Limited-edition hats and weapons have been awarded for pre-ordering or gaining Achievements in other content from Steam, both from Valve (such as \"Left 4 Dead 2\" and \"Alien Swarm\") or other third-party games such as \"\", \"Worms Reloaded\", \"Killing Floor\", or \"Poker Night at the Inventory\" (which features the Heavy class as a character). According to Robin Walker, Valve introduced these additional hats as an indirect means for players to show status within the game or their affiliation with another game series simply by visual appearance.\n\nThe Red Pyro, Heavy, and Spy all function as a single playable character in the PC release of \"Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed\".\n\nThe game's first television ad premiered during the first episode of the fifth season of \"The Venture Bros.\" in June 2013, featuring in-game accessories that were created with the help of Adult Swim.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" received widespread critical acclaim, with overall scores of 92/100 \"universal acclaim\" on Metacritic. Many reviewers praised the cartoon-styled graphics, and the resulting light-hearted gameplay, and the use of distinct personalities and appearances for the classes impressed a number of critics, with \"PC Gamer UK\" stating that \"until now multiplayer games just haven't had it.\" Similarly, the game modes were received well, \"GamePro\" described the settings as focusing \"on just simple fun\", while several reviewers praised Valve for the map \"Hydro\" and its attempts to create a game mode with variety in each map. Additional praise was bestowed on the game's level design, game balance and teamwork promotion. \"Team Fortress 2\" has received several awards individually for its multiplayer gameplay and its graphical style, as well as having received a number of \"game of the year\" awards as part of \"The Orange Box\".\n\nAlthough \"Team Fortress 2\" was well received, its removal of class-specific grenades, a feature of previous \"Team Fortress\" incarnations, was controversial amongst reviewers. IGN expressed some disappointment over this, while conversely, \"PC Gamer UK\" approved, stating \"grenades have been removed entirely—thank God\". Some further criticism came over a variety of issues, such as the lack of extra content such as bots (although Valve has since added bots in an update), problems of players finding their way around maps due to the lack of a minimap, and some criticism of the Medic class being too passive and repetitive in his nature. The Medic class has since been re-tooled by Valve, giving it new unlockable weapons and abilities.\n\nWith the \"Gold Rush Update\" in April 2008, Valve had started to add fundamentals of character customization through unlockable weapons for each class, which continued in subsequent updates, most notably the \"Sniper vs. Spy Update\" in April 2009, which introduced unlockable cosmetic items into the game. Further updates expanded the number of weapons and cosmetics available, but also introduced monetization options, eventually allowing it to go free-to-play. To this end, \"Team Fortress 2\" is considered one of the first games to offer games as a service which would become more prevalent in the 2010s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847431", "title": "Buffer stop", "text": "Buffer stop\n\nA buffer stop, bumper, bumping post, bumper block or stopblock (US), is a device to prevent railway vehicles from going past the end of a physical section of track.\n\nThe design of the buffer stop is dependent, in part, on the kind of couplings that the railway uses, since the coupling gear is the first part of the vehicle that the buffer stop touches. The term \"buffer stop\" is of British origin, since railways in Great Britain principally use buffer-and-screw couplings between vehicles.\n\nSeveral different types of buffer stop have been developed. They differ depending on the type of coupler used and on the intended application.\n\n\nIf there is extra room behind the bumper block, there is usually a sand or ballast drag that is designed to further retard a runaway train. One such accident occurred when a Northern City Line train powered past the bumper block at Moorgate station in 1975 on the London Underground system.\n\nLargely because of its mass, a train transfers an enormous amount of kinetic energy in a collision with a buffer stop. Rigid buffers can safely cope only with very low-speed impacts (\"i.e.\", nearly stationary). To improve stopping performance, a way of dissipating this energy is needed, through compression or friction. Following a buffer stop accident at Frankfurt am Main in 1902, the Rawie company developed a large range of energy-absorbing buffer stops. Similar hydraulic buffer stops were developed by Ransomes & Rapier in the UK.\n\nWhen it is desired to slow or stop moving trains, without erecting a solid buffer stop, dowty retarders may be employed. They press upwards against the wheels, and may optionally be turned off as required.\n\n\nWheel stops or car stops are used to stop small numbers of light vehicles at the end of level storage tracks or to chock individual vehicles on shallow grades.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847443", "title": "Upper Sioux Indian Reservation", "text": "Upper Sioux Indian Reservation\n\nThe Upper Sioux Indian Reservation, or Pezihutazizi in Dakota, is the reservation of the Upper Sioux Community, a federally recognized tribe of the Dakota people, that includes the Mdewakanton.\n\nThe Upper Sioux Indian Reservation is located in Minnesota Falls Township along the Minnesota River in eastern Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota, south of Granite Falls. It was created in 1938 when of land were returned to the tribe by the federal government, under the Indian Reorganization Act encouraging tribal self-government.\n\nAs of the 2000 census, the reservation recorded a resident population of 57 persons. Its land area is currently . The tribe operates the Prairie's Edge Casino Resort. Every August, the Upper Sioux community holds its \"Pejhutazizi Oyate\" traditional \"wacipi\" (pow-wow).\n\nThis reservation was originally established for the Wahpeton and Sisseton bands of the Upper Dakota. Under the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux of 1851 with the United States, it encompassed an area about wide and long along the Minnesota River. Following the Dakota War of 1862, the federal government punished the Dakota by drastically reducing the sizes of two reservations along the river, in an attempt to force the Dakota out of the area. Many of the people did move westward, past the Mississippi River, and many of their descendants live on reservations in South Dakota.\n\nIn 1938 the federal government returned of land to the tribe, who were mostly landless, under the Indian Reorganization Act of the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. It also encouraged tribes to revive their self-government.\n\nA decade later, the federal government began to promote the Indian termination policy, to end recognition of tribes they thought could successfully assimilate to mainstream society. Such termination would allocate their communal lands among individual households and end federal benefits associated with federal recognition. This policy was followed by the US government from the 1940s to the 1960s. The Department of Interior issued a memo dated 19 January 1955 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) indicating that terminations were being reviewed in proposed legislation for four Indian communities of southwestern Minnesota, including the Lower Sioux Community in Redwood and Scott counties, the New Upper Sioux Community in Yellow Medicine County, the Prairie Island Community in Goodhue County, and about 15 individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County.\n\nDiscussions between the BIA and the Indians in the identified tribes had begun in 1953 and continued throughout 1954. Although the Prairie Island and Lower Sioux communities drafted agreements to divide communal lands into plots with individual land ownership, the Upper Sioux strongly opposed tribal lands being divided under fee-simple title.\n\nOn 26 January 1955, US Senator Edward Thye introduced a bill (S704) to provide for termination of the named tribes. In addition to resistance within the tribes, non-Native American residents of the area opposed termination, as they realized state expenditures might increase to accommodate services to those who would be classified as new residents, and they expressed their opposition to the committee reviewing the bill. The Minnesota Governor's Commission on Human Rights also opposed the legislation, indicating that it would \"not adequately protect the interests of the Indians...\" The bill died in committee, never reaching the Senate floor.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847452", "title": "The Chad Mitchell Trio", "text": "The Chad Mitchell Trio\n\nThe Chad Mitchell Trio – later known as The Mitchell Trio – were a North American vocal group who became known during the 1960s. They performed traditional folk songs and some of John Denver's early compositions. They were particularly notable for performing satirical songs that criticized current events during the time of the cold war, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War.\n\nThe original group was formed in 1958, by William Chadbourne “Chad” Mitchell (from Portland, Oregon, born December 5, 1936), Mike Kobluk (from Trail, British Columbia, Canada, born December 10, 1937), and Mike Pugh (from Pasco, Washington) when they were students and glee club members at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, United States. They were encouraged by Spokane Catholic priest Reinard W. Beaver, who invited the three to travel with him to New York City in the summer of 1959 and to try performing in the burgeoning folk-music scene.\n\nThe key people who helped the trio get going were musical arranger Milton Okun and star performer/singer Harry Belafonte. Okun provided a professional polish to their performing skills, which helped them gain both a key booking at New York City's Blue Angel club and radio appearances with Arthur Godfrey and television appearances with Pat Boone. Belafonte had them appear as back-up singers, with a small featured spotlight, in his May 1960 Carnegie Hall concert and signed them to his Belafonte Enterprises management firm.\n\nIn the summer of 1960, Pugh left the group to return to college. After auditioning over 150 singers, the group chose Joe Frazier (born in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, on January 14, 1937) to replace Pugh.\n\nAfter recording mostly conventional folk songs, the trio released the then-daring satire \"The John Birch Society\" (\"Fighting for the right to fight/The right fight for the Right!\"), which established their ability to perform more controversial material. Their departure from Belafonte Enterprises in 1962, followed by their move to Mercury Records in 1963, gave them more freedom to add aggressively political songs to their body of folk, love, and world-music songs. They appeared on a variety of American TV shows, including \"The Bell Telephone Hour\" and \"Hootenanny\".\n\nMitchell left the trio in 1965 to embark on a solo singing career. Another audition process replaced him with the young (and unknown) singer/songwriter John Denver. The group retained the well-known \"Mitchell Trio\" name, with Denver writing some of the group's songs.\n\nFrazier's departure from the trio in 1966 brought in replacement David Boise. After a final live release, Kobluk left; Denver and Boise replaced Kobluk with Michael Johnson (who would later go on as a solo artist to record \"Bluer Than Blue\" among other popular songs) and because of contractual requirements that prohibited using the \"Mitchell\" name after the last original member left became \"Denver, Boise and Johnson\". Shortly thereafter, however, the group disbanded in 1969.\n\nMike Kobluk, Joe Frazier and David Boise later left the music industry, Chad Mitchell released a number of solo albums before retiring from music, and Denver's time with the trio became the springboard to his successful solo career. Michael Johnson recorded more than 15 albums as a solo artist; he died at his Minneapolis home on July 25, 2017. Frazier became an Episcopal Church priest.\n\nThe Mitchell/Kobluk/Frazier trio and John Denver reunited in 1987 for several concerts, some broadcast on PBS. These are the only recordings of all four members singing together.\n\nThe Mitchell/Kobluk/Frazier trio reunited again in 2005 for a short program as part of a concert also featuring Tom Paxton and The Kingston Trio's current lineup in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mitchell/Kobluk/Frazier reunited again for a one-night performance on October 6, 2007, in Spokane, home of their alma mater, and where Mitchell and Kobluk live about two blocks apart. They continue to tour with artists like Tom Paxton and performed for President Obama at a 40th anniversary celebration in Washington D.C. for Representative Dave Obey, who is a fan of the group. Concerts in 2009 were part of a 50th Anniversary tour that culminated with a benefit in Big Bear Lake, California, in December.\n\nJoe Frazier died in his sleep on March 28, 2014, at the age of 77.\n\nThe trio of Chad Mitchell and Mike Kobluk augmented by group bassist Ron Greenstein performed their farewell concert on November 15, 2014, at the venue Bethesda Blues & Jazz in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nOther featured musicians for the trio through the years included:\n\nThe Trio's first recordings for Colpix were similar to the conventional folk songs that were gaining popularity then as an alternative to the early rock-and-roll genre. It was songs from their first Kapp Records release — \"Mighty Day\" (about the 1900 Galveston, Texas hurricane); \"Rum By Gum\" (about the Temperance/Prohibition movement); and \"Lizzie Borden\" (an irreverent satire countering the common heroizing of the accused axe murderer) — which began to make the Trio distinct.\n\nTheir next Kapp album contained \"The John Birch Society\". \"The Ides of Texas\" from their final Kapp release took aim at financier Billie Sol Estes.\n\nTheir live performance album \"At The Bitter End\" on Kapp Records also included the song \"Moscow Nights\" with its original Russian lyrics, despite the Cold War era of strained relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.\n\nThe trio's Mercury albums continued its trend to record topical and controversial songs. \"Twelve Days\" imagined a group of former Nazis singing new lyrics to the old Christmas carol; a similar theme would be explored later in the \"I Was Not A Nazi Polka\". \"Barry's Boys\" (\"You too can join the crew/Tippecanoe and Nixon, too\") portrayed a view of the followers of conservative Republican 1964 Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. \"A Dying Business\" went after funeral costs and customs, while \"The Draft Dodger Rag\" (by Phil Ochs: \"Sarge, I'm only eighteen/I got a ruptured spleen/And I always carry a purse\") explored the beginnings of resistance to the Vietnam War. \"What Kind of Life Is That\" pondered on celebrity fame (specifically, that of Elizabeth Taylor). \"Alma Mater\" (\"We'll miss the classrooms/Where we learned/And effigies we burned\") took on segregationist policies at the University of Mississippi, but was followed later by \"Your Friendly, Liberal, Neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan.\"\n\nWhile the Mitchell Trio became best known for such songs, they also produced a solid body of work which showed that folk music could be \"polished\" yet remain close to its roots. They recorded shanties numbers like \"Whup Jamboree\" and \"The Golden Vanity\", as well as folk dance numbers like \"Hello Susan Brown\". They could do rousing gospel music numbers like \"You Can Tell The World\", \"I Feel So Good About It (Sin Bound Train)\", and \"One Day When I Was Lost (Easter Morn)\". They were the first folk group to record many of the songs of Tom Paxton, such as \"The Marvelous Toy\", \"What Did You Learn In School Today?\", and \"We Didn't Know\". They also sang the work of Woody Guthrie (\"The Great Historical Bum (Bragging Song)\"), Shel Silverstein (\"The Hip Song (It Does Not Pay To Be Hip)\", \"Three Legged Man\"), and Bob Dylan (\"Blowin' in the Wind\" (they were in fact the first to release it, but Peter, Paul and Mary's subsequent rendition became the best-known version), \"With God On Our Side\", \"Mr. Tambourine Man\").\n\nThe Mitchell Trio also did the first major recording of John Denver's later hit \"For Baby (For Bobbi)\" and also handled his \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\". Their final album offered a soft, harmonized version of The Beatles' \"She Loves You\". Kobluk's solo vocal on \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" pre-dated the Roberta Flack major hit version by several years.\n\nJohnny Cash cited their version of \"Four Strong Winds\" as a stylistic influence and included it on his \"Artist's Choice\" album of favorites. The 2003 mockumentary \"A Mighty Wind\" featured The Folksmen, a group described \"as a more leftish variation on the Chad Mitchell Trio.\"\n\nChad Mitchell, Mike Kobluk, Mike Pugh:\n\nChad Mitchell, Mike Kobluk, Joe Frazier:\n\nMike Kobluk, Joe Frazier, John Denver:\n\nMike Kobluk, John Denver, David Boise:\n\nChad Mitchell solo\n\nReunion albums:\n\nDVDs:\n\n\"The Mitchell Trio Song Book\" (Robert Shelton, editor/writer; Walter Rain, music editor; Quadrangle Books, Chicago, 1964 [Library Of Congress Catalog Card Number 64-24290] )\n\n"}

A Seven Summits list may therefore sometimes include Mount Wilhelm.\n\nMount Wilhelm received its name in 1888 when a German newspaper correspondent, Hugo Zöller, climbed the Finisterre Range, south-east of Madang, and named the Bismarck Range after the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, and the four highest peaks of the range after him and his children: Ottoberg, Herbert-berg, Marienberg and Wilhelm-berg. Otto-berg seemed to Zöller to be the highest of the range, but it was later discovered to be only and the distant Wilhelmberg was much taller.\n\nIt was not until August 1938 when Leigh Vial, a government patrol officer, and two Niu Ginians, his \"Mangi mastas\", \"Namba Wan Bare Kuakawa\" (Kugl'kane) and \"Gend\" (\"Mondia Nigle\"), made the first recorded ascent. It was noted by Vial that even though the mountain was close to the equator, snow existed on top of the mountain at the time of ascent.\n\nDuring the Second World War in the early hours of May 22, 1944, an American F-7A (a converted B-24 Liberator) named \"Under Exposed\" crashed into the mountain while flying too low. The aircraft left from Nadzab airbase, close to Lae, and had been assigned for a reconnaissance mission to photograph Padaidori Island in Dutch New Guinea. Around 0400 the plane crashed into Wilhelm at about above the twin lakes.\nAll crew were killed and most of the wreckage landed in the topmost lake although some can still be seen today. The only remains at the site are from the plane, as all bodies have been recovered.\n\nA number of people have died trying to climb the mountain. An Australian Army Sergeant, Christopher Donnan, died in December 1971 when he fell down a steep slope. There is a plaque at the point where he was last seen. In August 1995 an Israeli backpacker died after he sprained his ankle and stayed behind while his group continued. He subsequently wandered off the track and fell into a ravine in the pre-dawn darkness. His body was found about a week later. On July 30 2005, 58-year-old Bob Martin, a marketing manager at Air Niugini, suffered a heart attack and died near the summit.\nIn 2001, a student from Muaina High School (Muaina High school Mt Wilhelm Expedition) died at Piunde-foot of Mt Wilhelm. He was later found to be an asthmatic patient. Another, local Papua New Guinean, from Tari in the Southern Highlands Province, died in 2007 a few meters south of the Christopher Donnan plaque. Local sources revealed that the deceased was unaware of the warning and was wearing only his sporting suit, T-shirt and Dunlop shoes. He was covered by debris and fallen rock fragments, forming a talus at the base of the southern tip of the Christopher Donnan section.\n\nMount Wilhelm is the most accessible mountain to climb in Papua New Guinea. Climbers have a choice of two different routes to the top. The most common route starts from the village of Keglsugl at the end of the road from Kundiawa in Simbu province. A harder hike and climb starts from the village of Ambullua in Western Highlands province.\n\nThe Keglsugl route involves climbing up and through a mountain rain forest and then along an alpine grassland glacial valley to the twin lakes of Piunde and Aunde. At Piunde there are two huts, one being an old Australian National University monitoring station and the other an 'A-Frame' hut. Though not a technical climb, various sections can be treacherous in wet weather. The climb is usually started during the night; the ascent and subsequent descent can take anywhere from nine to 24 hours. Reaching the peak at dawn allows a better chance of clear weather.\n\nThe other route from Ambullua is a much more challenging 4-day hike.\n\n\n"}

Ralph died in December 2017, after falling down steps in his Portland, Oregon, home. After Carney's parents divorced when he was 6, he lived part of the time with his mother, Mary Stormer, and part of the time with his father, Jim Carney, who had moved to a different neighborhood in West Akron, Ohio. Dan Auerbach lived around the block in this neighborhood, and the two met and played tag football with Auerbach's friends, although Patrick and Auerbach did not become friends until high school. Carney stated in an interview with \"Modern Drummer\" that he never took drum lessons as a kid, but learned by mimicking friends that were also drummers, using a $150 drumset that he bought using money earned from a job washing dishes at the Mustard Seed grocery and cafe in an Akron suburb, Bath Township. As a teenager, Carney was musically influenced by bands such as Pavement, Captain Beefheart and fellow Akron band Devo.\n\nIn 2001 Carney and Auerbach, lead singer and guitarist, formed The Black Keys, releasing their debut album \"The Big Come Up\" less than a year later.

He lost his ministerial post in the reshuffle on 15 July 2014 and was succeeded by Claire Perry. He became Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party for London on 20 July 2017 and was sacked the following 16 December after participating in a Brexit rebellion against the government of Theresa May three days earlier. Hammond was however appointed to be a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Care on 16 November 2018, following the promotion of Stephen Barclay to the position of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. On 3 September 2019, he had the whip removed after voting for a bill ruling out leaving the European Union without a deal. However, on 29 October he was one of ten Conservative MPs to have the whip restored.\n\nHammond was born in Southampton and privately educated at the city's King Edward VI School before reading Economics at Queen Mary University of London. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree, he began a career in finance at a leading fund management house and subsequently worked for major investment banks. Hammond was appointed a Director of the Equities division of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in 1994 and four years later joined Commerzbank Securities. In 2000 he was promoted to Director, Pan European Research, with responsibility for seventy professionals based in London and across Europe.\n\nHammond first stood for Parliament for North Warwickshire at the 1997 general election, being comfortably defeated by Labour's Mike O'Brien. Contesting Wimbledon in 2001 general election, he failed to regain what had been a safe seat for the Conservatives before Labour's 1997 landslide and was defeated by the Labour incumbent, Roger Casale. He was elected a councillor for the Village ward in the London Borough of Merton election in 2002 and subsequently became Deputy Leader of the Conservative Group on Merton Council.\n\nHammond was the successful parliamentary candidate for Wimbledon at the 2005 general election, gaining a 7.2% swing to the Conservatives. In December 2005, David Cameron, then the new Conservative Leader, appointed him as Shadow Minister for Transport on the Opposition front bench. On 6 May 2010, Hammond was reelected as the MP for Wimbledon. Following that election, Hammond became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. On 4 September 2012, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. He was removed from that post following a Cabinet reshuffle in July 2014.\n\nIn 2012, Hammond was the subject of a parliamentary investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose investments in Harwood Film partnership, a legal investment scheme which permitted the deferral of tax payments, in the Register of Members' Interests. He subsequently apologised for the \"oversight\" in not registering the financial interest but was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2013, Hammond consistently voted in favour of allowing same-sex couples to marry. Following the confidence and supply arrangement between the Conservatives and the DUP after 2017 general election, Hammond promised to stand up and protect LGBT and Women’s rights from any potential dilution. In 2019, he voted to extend abortion and same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.\n\nIn December 2014, Hammond assumed a second job as an adviser to Inmarsat; he was cleared to do so by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. He had been criticised earlier that year for having been the fourth most frequent user of ministerial chauffeur-driven \"top up\" cars, at 138 uses per year, during his time in office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. Hammond had previously criticised Ken Livingstone in the House of Commons for setting up companies to reduce his tax bill. \"The Daily Telegraph\" subsequently alleged that Hammond had sought to avoid tax by registering the ownership of his Portuguese villa through an offshore-registered company, which his lawyers described as a \"normal\" arrangement that \"did not result in tax benefits for him or his wife\".\n\nThe article about Stephen Hammond on Wikipedia was one of a number edited in May 2015 by computers owned by Parliament in what \"The Daily Telegraph\" described as \"\"\"a deliberate attempt to hide embarrassing information from the electorate\".\"\" The deleted information concerned his frequent use of chauffeur-driven cars while in government.\n\nHammond announced in early 2016 that he would wait until Cameron's renegotiations before endorsing either a Remain vote or a Leave vote in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. On 14 June 2016, he endorsed a vote to remain in the European Union. On 13 December 2017, Hammond was involved in a rebellion against the government of Theresa May in which the government suffered a defeat on a key Brexit vote about granting MPs a 'meaningful vote' in Parliament. He was subsequently dismissed as the Conservative party vice-chairman over the incident.\n\nIn the 2019 Conservative leadership election, Hammond endorsed Matt Hancock's bid for the party leadership.\nHammond lost the party whip during the September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs. Despite this, he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the next general election. Hammond was reelected at the 2019 general election with a much reduced majority.\n\nIn Parliament, Hammond has been an advocate of giving summer-born and premature children the right to start school a year later, to give them extra time for development. In October 2015 he held an adjournment debate on this issue, arguing that \"summer-born children can suffer from long-term development issues and a lag in educational standards\". and highlighting the inconsistent treatment of these children by Councils. In response, Nick Gibb MP, the Minister of State for Schools, set out plans in a letter to all schools to change the school admissions code to allow summer-born children to start reception class at the age of 5.\n\nIn October 2016, Hammond held another adjournment debate on this topic, urging the Government to take action more quickly and to provide a timetable for the changes.\n\nHammond has been married to Sally Hammond since 1991. The couple live in Wimbledon Park with two pets and they have one daughter. He employs his wife as his Office Manager on an annual salary of over £45,000.\n\nHammond, a keen sportsman, used to play hockey for a National League team and for his county.

As far back as the first century AD, the greeting in popular use had the form \"have\" (pronounced or perhaps ), with the aspirated initial syllable and the second syllable shortened, for which the most explicit description has been given by Quintilian in his \"Institutio Oratoria\". Interestingly, while \"have\" would be informal in part because it has the non-etymological aspiration, centuries later, any and all aspiration would instead completely disappear from popular speech, becoming an artificial and learned feature.\n\n\"Ave\" in Ecclesiastical Latin is ideally , and in English, it tends to be pronounced .\n\nThe term was notably used to greet the Caesar or other authorities. Suetonius recorded that on one occasion, naumachiarii—captives and criminals fated to die fighting during mock naval encounters—addressed Claudius Caesar with the words \"Ave Caesar!

He is always banging out a modern jazz beat with his hands, to music in his head, and he also plays jazz piano and bebop trumpet. His abhorrence of conventional social forms is signified by comical reactions to three words: \"work\", \"marriage\", and \"police\". For example, whenever the word \"work\" is mentioned, even in passing, he yelps \"Work?!\" and jumps with fear or even faints. He serves as a foil to the well-groomed, well-dressed, strait-laced Dobie, who also hates to work, and the contrast between the two friends provides much of the humor of the series. \n\nBy the third season of \"Dobie Gillis\", Maynard becomes less of the stereotypical beatnik and more a free soul who \"does his own thing,\" as he might say—including collecting tinfoil or petrified frogs, seeing the old Endicott Building get torn down and going to see the movie \"The Monster That Devoured Cleveland\", which perpetually ran at the Central City Bijou throughout the entire series run. In one episode, he invites Dobie to accompany him to a double-feature of the film and its sequel, \"Son of the Monster that Devoured Cleveland\".

Scripps Company is an American broadcasting company founded in 1878 as a chain of daily newspapers by Edward Willis \"E. W.\" Scripps. It was also formerly a media conglomerate. The company is headquartered inside the Scripps Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. Its corporate motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\"\n\nIn terms of market reach, Scripps is the second largest operator of ABC (which is owned by The Walt Disney Company by way of its Walt Disney Television subsidiary) affiliates, behind the Sinclair Broadcast Group, and ahead of Hearst Television and Tegna.\n\nThe E. W. Scripps Company was a newspaper company founded on November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland \"Penny Press\".\n\nIn 1894, Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League to reflect the leadership of \"Cincinnati Post\" general manager Milton A. McRae, a longtime partner. The company expanded during the decade to publish newspapers in California, Denver, Chicago, Dallas and Nashville and elsewhere.\n\nIn early November 1922, the Scripps-McRae League was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers to recognize company executive Roy W. Howard. On November 23, the E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated and placed in trust for Scripps' children and grandchildren. The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. (A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post organization, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.) E. W. Scripps died in 1926.\n\nOn June 2, 1902, Scripps founded the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), based in Cleveland, Ohio, as a news report service for different Scripps-owned newspapers. It started selling content to non-Scripps owned newspapers in 1907, and by 1909, it became a more general syndicate, offering comics, pictures and features as well. It moved from Cleveland to Chicago in 1915, with an office in San Francisco. NEA rapidly grew and delivered content to 400 newspapers in 1920 and about 700 in 1930. Today, it is oldest syndicate still in operation.\n\nScripps created the United Press news agency in 1907 by uniting three smaller syndicates and controlled it until a 1958 merger with William Randolph Hearst's smaller competing agency, INS, to form United Press International. With the Hearst Corporation as a minority partner, UPI continued under Scripps management until it was sold off in 1982. A separate wire service, the Scripps Howard News Service, operated for 96 years from 1917 to 2013. \n\nUnited Feature Syndicate was formed in 1919 as a division of UP to distribute editorial columns, features and comic strips, and became a dominant player in the syndication market in the fall of 1931 thanks to Scripps' acquisition of the \"New York World\", which controlled the Pulitzer company's syndication arms, Press Publishing Co. and World Feature Service. In May 1978, Scripps merged United Feature Syndicate and Newspaper Enterprise Association to form United Media Enterprises.\n\nThe company expanded its newspaper holdings throughout the pre-World War II period, acquiring many titles and merging them, including the \"Rocky Mountain News\" and \"Knoxville News-Sentinel\". A trickle of closures and sales occurred over the next few decades. In 1966, Scripps' \"New York World-Telegram\" was merged into the \"New York World Journal Tribune\", which closed in 1967. Papers in Indianapolis, Washington, Houston and Fort Worth were closed in the 1960s and 1970s, and the former flagship \"Cleveland Press\" was sold in 1980. Scripps also closed properties in Memphis, Columbus, Thousand Oaks and El Paso throughout the 1980s and 1990s, while selling the \"Pittsburgh Press\" in 1992. \n\nIn 1997, Scripps bought daily newspapers in the Texas cities of Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM. The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling. (Scripps eventually spun off all of its newspapers into Journal Media Group in 2015.)\n\nScripps made its first foray into broadcasting in 1935, forming a company called Continental Radio and buying radio stations WCPO in Cincinnati and WNOX in Knoxville. After the war, In 1947, Scripps opened its first television station, Cleveland-based WEWS-TV, with Memphis-based WMC-TV and Cincinnati-based WCPO-TV in subsequent years. It now owns dozens of TV and radio stations. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scripps became a cable television provider and also developed programming for cable, notably regional sports programming like the SportSouth Network in 1990, Food Network in 1993 and HGTV in 1994. (Scripps spun off its cable properties into Scripps Network Interactive in 2008.)\n\nThe company went public with an IPO in 1988. It owned 20 daily newspapers and 9 television stations at the time, with and cable systems in 10 states. The company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the 35-story high-rise Scripps Center, in 1990.\n\nIn October 2007, Scripps announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.\n\nAfter a test launch at WFTS-TV in 2009, Scripps television stations launched YouTube channels in 2010. These are similar to YouTube channels operated by Hearst Television and LIN Television.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, United Media struck a distribution deal with Universal Uclick (now known as Andrews McMeel Syndication) for syndication of the company's 150 comic strip and news features, which became effective on June 1 of that year. At that point, United Media, and by extension the Scripps Company, got out of the syndication business.\n\nOn September 12, 2011, Scripps partnered with Cox Media Group and Raycom Media to launch \"Right This Minute\", a viral video program. On the same day, Scripps launched \"The List\", a news magazine. Both were part of an approach for \"homegrown\" programming—programming created by Scripps. Raycom also launched \"America Now\" on the same day. The creator of \"RTM\" and \"The List\" applied this \"homegrown\" programming approach to Tegna in 2015, with the launch of \"T.D. Jakes\". Scripps launched \"Let's Ask America\" in 2013 (now cancelled), partnering with Telepictures to do so, and \"Pickler and Ben\" in 2017.\n\nOn October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million. This purchase nearly doubled the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.\n\nIn December 2013, Scripps purchased Newsy for $35 Million.\n\nOn July 30, 2014, Scripps and Journal Communications announced that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets. The deal created a broadcast group under the E. W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name. The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015. The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015. In turn, Journal Media Group was acquired by Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.\n\nIn April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E. W. Scripps. In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer.\n\nOn August 1, 2017, Scripps announced the purchase of Katz Broadcasting and its three networks plus Bounce which Katz operates, for $292 million, acquiring the other 95% of the company. The purchase was completed on October 2, 2017. On May 22, 2018, Scripps announced that it was changing its common stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, which occurred on June 4, 2018.\n\n\nThe distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media were outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.\n\nScripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982.\n\nScripps' broadcast television stations division—also commonly known as Scripps Media or Scripps Howard Broadcasting, currently owns or operates 62 television stations in forty-three markets, with full-power and low-power stations as well as rebroadcaster, translator, repeater and satellite stations included. Among them, nineteen ABC affiliates, twelve CBS affiliates, eleven NBC affiliates, six Fox affiliates, five CW affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, and one station independent of any network affiliation. Its portfolio is the most diverse in the industry—in terms of market sizes, from New York City to Helena, Montana.\n\nScripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.\n\nIn October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of Scripps' cable provider operation.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1995, Scripps was a partner in the regional sports network SportSouth, along with Turner Broadcasting and Tele-Communications, Inc.; in 1996 the network was sold to News Corporation and became Fox Sports South.\n\nAttempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations. Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.\n\nOn October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit. This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31 and the FCC on November 29. The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million. The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.\n\nOn January 25, 2018, it was announced that Scripps had placed its radio station unit for sale. The divestiture of these stations – which were acquired through the company's 2015 acquisition of Journal Communications – would result in the separation of Scripps's television stations in Tulsa, Omaha, Milwaukee, Boise and Tucson from their co-owned radio clusters (in the case of Tulsa, KJRH-TV would be separated from KFAQ for the second time; the two stations, then using the shared KVOO callsign, were first split up in 1970, when Central Plains Enterprises sold the then-KVOO-TV to Scripps). In June 2018, Griffin Communications reached a deal to buy the Scripps Tulsa radio cluster. The sale was completed on July 28, 2018. In July 2018, Good Karma Brands reached a deal to buy the Scripps Milwaukee radio cluster. The sale was completed on November 1, 2018.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, Scripps agreed to purchase ABC affiliates KXXV in Waco, Texas and satellite station KRHD-CD in Bryan, Texas and WTXL-TV in Tallahassee, Florida, which are being spun off from the Gray Television-Raycom Media merger in order to alleviate ownership conflicts involving Gray's ownership of CBS affiliate KWTX-TV and its semi-satellite KBTX-TV in the Waco market and CBS affiliate WCTV and Retro Television Network affiliate WFXU in the Tallahassee market.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, Cordillera Communications announced that it would sell all but one of its television stations to Scripps. KVOA in Tucson, Arizona is not included in the deal as Scripps already owns KGUN-TV and KWBA in that market, and Cordillera will concurrently sell KVOA to Quincy Media. The FCC approved the sale on April 5, 2019, and the sale was completed on May 1.\n\nOn March 20, 2019, Scripps announced that it would acquire eight of the 21 (initially 19) stations being divested as part of Nexstar Media Group's $580 million (USD) acquisition of Tribune Media. The Tribune stations include CBS affiliates WTKR in Norfolk and WTVR-TV in Richmond—both in Virginia, along with Fox affiliates KSTU in Salt Lake City, Utah and WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan and CW affiliates WPIX in New York City, WGNT in Norfolk, Virginia and WSFL-TV in Miami, Florida. The only Nexstar station being acquired is CW affiliate KASW in Phoenix, Arizona—which would create a duopoly with longtime Scripps-owned ABC affiliate KNXV-TV. Also, Nexstar has the option to buy WPIX back between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The FCC approved the sale on September 16 with all of the transactions being completed on September 19.\n\nNotes:\n\nOther Notes:\n\nNotes:\n\nScripps also operates the national (US) spelling bee.

It participated in battles on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. The division was activated in December 1942. Many of the men of the division were young German conscripts, with a cadre of NCOs and staff from the SS Division Leibstandarte and other Waffen SS divisions. Hohenstaufen took part in the relief of German forces in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket, the Normandy battles, Operation Market Garden, the Ardennes Offensive and Operation Spring Awakening. The division surrendered to the United States Army on 5 May 1945, at Steyr.\n\nThe SS Division Hohenstaufen was formed, along with its sister formation 10th SS Division Frundsberg, in France in February 1943. The division was mainly formed from Reich Labour Service conscripts. Originally, Hohenstaufen was designated as a Panzergrenadier division, but in October 1943 it was upgraded to Panzer division status, with an estimated manpower of about 19,000. At its formation, Hohenstaufen was commanded by SS-Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich. The title Hohenstaufen came from the Hohenstaufen dynasty, a German noble family who produced a number of kings and emperors in the 12th and 13th centuries AD.\n\nAfter the encirclement of General Hans-Valentin Hube's 1st Panzer Army in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket in Ukraine, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein requested that the Hohenstaufen and Frundsberg divisions be sent to attempt to link up with the encircled force. Arriving in late March 1944, the divisions were formed into the II SS Panzer Corps and were sent into the attack near the town of Tarnopol. In three days of combat, the Hohenstaufen destroyed 74 Soviet tanks, 84 self propelled assault guns, 21 anti tank guns, and 12 mortars. After heavy fighting in the season of \"rasputitsa\" (\"roadlessness\"), the division effected a link-up with Hube's forces near the town of Buchach. The division's actions helped prevent the encirclement of the 1st Panzer Army. During these battles, Hohenstaufen had suffered 1,011 casualties. The II SS Panzer Corps was to act as reserve for Army Group North Ukraine. After the Allied invasion of northern France on 6 June 1944, the II SS Panzer Corps, including Hohenstaufen, was sent west on 12 June, to defend Caen in Normandy.\n\nHohenstaufen suffered losses from Allied fighter bombers during its move to Normandy, delaying its arrival until 26 June 1944. Approximately 50% of the division's tanks broke down during its movement to Normandy. The division's armored forces would be reinforced by the newly attached 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. This would provide Hohenstaufen with 127 additional combat vehicles including 79 Panther tanks. The original plan for Hohenstaufen to attack towards the Allied beachhead was made impossible by a British offensive to take Caen. The II SS Panzer Corps was instead put into the line to support the weakened forces defending Caen, where Hohenstaufen suffered 1,891 casualties. On 10 July, the division was pulled back into reserve, to be replaced by the 277th Infantry Division. The division's depleted Panzergrenadier regiments were eventually merged to form Panzergrenadier Regiment Hohenstaufen. The division saw much action defending against British armour during Operation Goodwood. During Operation Jupiter Hohenstaufen destroyed 58 British tanks with many of them being Churchill tanks.\n\nAfter the launch of the Canadian Operation Totalize, Hohenstaufen avoided encirclement in the Falaise pocket and kept the narrow escape route from this pocket open. By 21 August, the Battle of Normandy was over, and the German forces were in full retreat. Obersturmbannführer Walter Harzer was placed in command of the division. It fought several rearguard actions during the retreat through France and Belgium and in early September 1944, the exhausted formation was pulled out of the line for rest and refit near the Dutch city of Arnhem. By this time, Hohenstaufen was down to approximately 7,000 men, from 15,900 at the end of June.\nUpon arriving in the Arnhem area, the majority of the remaining armoured vehicles were loaded onto trains in preparation for transport to repair depots in Germany. On Sunday, 17 September 1944, the Allies launched Operation Market-Garden, and the division fought in the Battle of Arnhem. The British 1st Airborne Division was dropped in Oosterbeek, to the west of Arnhem. Only the division's reconnaissance battalion, equipped mostly with wheeled and half tracked vehicles, was ready for action.\n\nBittrich ordered Hohenstaufen to occupy Arnhem and secure a vital metal girder bridge (later torn down, rebuilt in concrete and named John Frost Bridge). The division encountered stiff resistance from the British \"Rote Teufeln\" (Eng. \"Red Devils\") 1st Airborne Division. The Reconnaissance Battalion, a 40-vehicle unit commanded by Hauptsturmführer Viktor Eberhard Gräbner, was sent south over the bridge to scout the area around Nijmegen. The bridge had already been captured by the Germans. Meanwhile, Colonel John Frost's 2nd Battalion of the British 1st Airborne Division had advanced into Arnhem and prepared defensive positions at the northern end of the bridge. They destroyed Gräbner's unit, which lost 12 vehicles out of 22 in the assault and around 70 men killed, including Gräbner. In all, the British 1st Airborne Division suffered 7,167 casualties out of 10,095 men. This action is depicted in the film \"A Bridge Too Far\".\n\nAfter the battle of Arnhem, Hohenstaufen moved to Paderborn for a much-needed rest and refit. On 12 December 1944, the division moved south to the Munstereifel. It was to act as a reserve for Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army, a part of the Ardennes offensive (\"\"). The 6th Panzer Army was to attack in the north, along the line St. Vith–Vielsalm. Initially, only the divisional reconnaissance and artillery units were involved in the fighting but on 21 December, the entire division was committed. The 9th SS Division tried to breakthrough defensive positions of the 82nd Airborne Division but failed.\n\nWhen the attack in the north stalled, the division was sent south to assist in the attacks on Bastogne, where it took heavy casualties from the American defenders and lost much of its equipment to Allied ground attack aircraft. On 7 January 1945, Hitler called off the operation and ordered all forces to concentrate around Longchamps, Belgium.\n\nThroughout the rest of January 1945, Hohenstaufen retreated to the German border. At the end of the month, the division was transferred to the Kaifenheim-Mayen area to be refitted. At the end of February, the division was sent east to Hungary as a part of the reformed 6th SS Panzer Army under Sepp Dietrich. The division, along with the majority of the SS Panzer units available, was to take part in Operation Spring Awakening, the offensive near Lake Balaton, which was aimed at relieving the forces encircled in Budapest by the Red Army.\n\nThe attack got under way on 6 March 1945. Due to the condition of the roads, the division had not reached its jump-off position when the attack began. A combination of mud and stiff Soviet resistance brought the offensive to a halt and on 16 March a Soviet counter-offensive threatened to cut off the 6th SS Panzer Army. Hohenstaufen was involved in the fighting to escape the Soviet encirclement. During these actions, Hohenstaufen destroyed 80 Soviet T-34 and IS tanks. On 1 May, the greatly depleted division was moved west to the Steyr–Amstetten area. On 5 May 1945, Hohenstaufen surrendered to the Americans.\n\nStructure of the division:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847534", "title": "Wilhelm Dörpfeld", "text": "Wilhelm Dörpfeld\n\nWilhelm Dörpfeld (26 December 1853 – 25 April 1940) was a German architect and archaeologist, a pioneer of stratigraphic excavation and precise graphical documentation of archaeological projects. He is famous for his work on Bronze Age sites around the Mediterranean, such as Tiryns and Hisarlik (the site of the legendary city of Troy), where he continued Heinrich Schliemann's excavations. Like Schliemann, Dörpfeld was an advocate of the historical reality of places mentioned in the works of Homer. While the details of his claims regarding locations mentioned in Homer's writings are not considered accurate by later archaeologists, his fundamental idea that they correspond to real places is accepted. Thus, his work greatly contributed to not only scientific techniques and study of these historically significant sites but also a renewed public interest in the culture and the mythology of Ancient Greece.\n\nHe was born in Barmen, Rhenish Prussia, the son of Christine and Friedrich William Dörpfeld. His father, a convinced Evangelist Christian and a famous pedagogue, tried to bestow deep religious sentiment to his family so Dörpfeld attended religious schools, where he received basic education in Latin and Greek. He graduated from Barmer High School in 1872, the year after his mother died. \n\nIn 1873, Dörpfeld enrolled in architectural studies in Berlin, into the famous Academy of Architecture (\"Bauakademie\"). At the same time, he started to work for the Bergisch-Maerki industrial company. His father could not finance his studies and so his sister, Anna, lent him money. During holiday breaks, Dörpfeld worked for the Rheine railway company, drawing sketches of buildings and different architectural objects. Dörpfeld graduated with honours in 1876. \n\nIn 1877, Dörpfeld became an assistant at the excavations of Ancient Olympia, Greece, conducted under Richard Bohn, Friedrich Adler, and Ernst Curtius. He later became the technical manager of the project. The group uncovered, among other artifacts, an intact statue of Hermes by Praxiteles. The excavations revived the memory of the ancient Olympic Games and contributed toward the establishment of the modern Olympic Games, in 1896. \n\nAfter his return from Olympia, Dörpfeld intended to take his architectural exam and settle down in Berlin. He needed a permanent source of income, as he prepared for the family life. In February 1883, he married Anne Adler, the daughter of his university professor Friedrich Adler. The couple had three children. Around the same time, he met Heinrich Schliemann, who persuaded him to join his archaeological expedition. \n\nIn 1882, Dörpfeld joined Schliemann, who was then excavating Troy. The two eventually became good friends and continued their collaboration on other projects as well. They excavated in Tiryns, from 1884 to 1885, and at Troy again from 1888 to 1890. Dörpfeld also excavated at the Acropolis of Athens from 1885 to 1890, where he unearthed the Hekatompedon temple (the pre-Classical Parthenon). He continued excavations at Pergamon (1900–1913, with Alexander Conze) and in 1931 in the Agora of Athens.\n\nIn 1886, Dörpfeld founded the German School of Athens, which was later named after him, as the Dörpfeld Gymnasium. From 1887 to 1912, he was the director of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. He published, in 1896, \"Das griechische Theater\", the first study of Greek theatre construction.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1912, Dörpfeld engaged in numerous academic debates on different archaeological topics. For example, in the mid-1930s, he took part in a celebrated debate with American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor on the nature of configuration of the three phases of the Parthenon. At the beginning of the 1920s, he started to lecture at the University of Jena but was not satisfied with teaching as a profession and so returned to Greece.\n\nDörpfeld died in 1940 on the island of Lefkada, Greece, where he had a house, believing that the bay of Nidri on the eastern coast of Lefkada was the historical Ithaca, home of Odysseus in Homer's \"Odyssey\".\n\nHe developed a method of dating archaeological sites by the strata in which objects were found and the type of materials used for the buildings. He corrected many of Schliemann's previous conclusions, including the shaft burial sites at Mycenae. Dörpfeld realized that the site was a \"tholos\" tomb, not the \"Treasury of Atreus\", as Schliemann claimed. \n\nDuring the Kavvadias's excavations, Dörpfeld was instrumental in correcting the previous belief that the temple of Athena, destroyed by the Persians in 480 BCE, was not beneath the Parthenon but to the north of it. He suggested the three different structures were built in the same place and spoke thus of Parthenon I, Parthenon II, and Parthenon III, applying the last term to the temple which is now there. Besides suggesting the existence of the two previous proto-Parthenons, he was able to reconstruct the dimensions of their ground plans.\n\nAfter Schliemann's death in 1890, his widow hired Dörpfeld to continue from where Schliemann had stopped in his excavations of Troy. Dörpfeld found nine separate cities, one atop the other, at the Hisarlik site. He argued that the sixth was the legendary Troy because it was larger than the first five cities and had high limestone walls, surrounding the city. Dörpfeld also found evidence for his claims in Mycenaean pottery, which he found in the same strata. Modern archaeologists, however, think that Homer wrote about Troy VII instead.\n\nDörpfeld spent a lot of time and energy trying to prove that Homer's epics were based on historical facts. He proposed that the bay of Nidri, on the eastern coast of Lefkada, was Ithaca, home of Odysseus. Dörpfeld compared several passages from the \"Odyssey\" to the actual geographical location of Lefkada, and he concluded that it must be the Homeric Ithaca. He was especially convinced by the passage:\n\nLefkada is connected today to Mainland Greece by a causeway and floating bridge, but in ancient times, it was connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land, making it a peninsula rather than an island. The strip of land was cut through by the Corinthians in the 7th century BCE. Modern geographers and hydrographers, however, have claimed that ancient Lefkada was an island. They noted that the causeway that connects it to the mainland today is a recent product of silting in the channel and so Lefkada may have experienced varying degrees of connection with the mainland over the last few thousand years. Dörpfeld may have believed that Lefkada was a freestanding island (or was regarded as such) at the time of Homer’s descriptions, in accordance with the above passage. Dörpfeld may also have felt that the difficulty of crossing the narrow causeway was referred to in Homer's enigmatic and repeated jest, \"For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot\".Homer, \"Odyssey\" 14.190, 16.224. In 1912-1914, Dörpfeld obtained permission from the King of Greece to excavate the area of Kardaki Temple, because it was part of the King's vacation home of Mon Repos. Dörpfeld published his results in two brief notes without illustrations in the \"Archöologischer Anzeiger\". He also excavated the Temple of Hera in Corfu.\n\nHe was one of the seminal figures in classical archaeology. His stratigraphic method of dating archaeological sites, based on the strata in which objects were found and the type of building materials, remains at the core in archaeological site analyses. His excavations, however, had many flaws, and his seeking to prove that Homer based his \"Odyssey\" on real places was rather romantic. His fellow archaeologists remarked that he overemphasised the importance of buildings in the dating of sites and often neglected less visible artifacts, such as pottery. Dörpfeld, however, remains known as one who brought much order and integrity into archaeology, and one who saved many archaeological sites from Schliemann's reckless excavations.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847553", "title": "Parallel and cross cousins", "text": "Parallel and cross cousins\n\nIn discussing consanguineal kinship in anthropology, a parallel cousin or ortho-cousin is a cousin from a parent's same-sex sibling, while a cross-cousin is from a parent's opposite-sex sibling. Thus, a parallel cousin is the child of the father's brother (paternal uncle's child) or of the mother's sister (maternal aunt's child), while a cross-cousin is the child of the mother's brother (maternal uncle's child) or of the father's sister (paternal aunt's child). Where there are unilineal descent groups in a society (i.e. matrilineal and/or patrilineal), one's parallel cousins on one or both sides will belong to one's own descent group, while cross-cousins will not (assuming descent group exogamy).\n\nThe role of cross-cousins is especially important in some cultures. For example, marriage is promoted between them in the Iroquois system. Parallel cousins are occasionally the subject of promoted marriage, such as the preferential marriage of a male to his father's brother's daughter, common among some pastoral peoples. Such a marriage helps keep property within a lineage. On the other hand, parallel cousin unions in some cultures would fall under an incest taboo, since parallel cousins are part of the subject's unilineage whereas cross-cousins are not.\n\nIn many \"classificatory\" systems of kinship terminology, relatives far beyond genealogical first cousins are referred to using the terms for parallel and cross-cousins. And in many societies, parallel cousins (but not cross-cousins) are also referred to by the same terms that are used for siblings. For instance, it is characteristic of the \"Iroquois\" system of kinship terminology, its variants the \"Crow\" and \"Omaha\", and most Australian Aboriginal systems, that a male parallel cousin is referred to as \"brother\", and a female parallel cousin is \"sister\". In an Iroquois type of terminology, if the terms used to refer to cross-cousins are assimilated to those for other relatives, it is generally in-laws (since marriage with cross-cousins is often preferentially favored), so that the terms for \"male cross-cousin\" and \"brother-in-law\" are the same, as are the terms for \"female cross-cousin\" and \"sister-in-law\".\n\nThe remaining types of kinship terminology (the \"Hawaiian\", \"Eskimo\" and \"Sudanese\") do not group parallel cousins together in opposition to cross-cousins.\n\nJohn Maynard Smith, in \"The Evolution of Sex\" (1978) notes that Richard D. Alexander suggested that uncertainty regarding paternity may help account for the intermarriage taboo on parallel, but not on cross-cousins. Fathers who are also brothers may overtly or covertly share sexual relations with the wife of one or the other, raising the possibility that apparent parallel cousins are in fact half-siblings, sired by the same father. Likewise, mothers who are also sisters may overtly or covertly share sexual access to the husband of one or the other, raising the possibility that apparent parallel cousins are in fact half-siblings, sired by the same father. Note that there is no possibility of any classificatory cousins sharing the same mother. Because maternal identity is never in question, they would be automatically classified as siblings. Only mistaken paternity leads to such errors.\n\nThis possibility is much less likely for cross-cousins, because in the absence of full-sibling incest, it is unlikely that cross-cousins can share a father by overt or covert sexual relationships. It would only be possible if a subject's mother had a brother whose wife was impregnated by the subject's father, thereby allowing apparent cross-cousins to be covert half-siblings, sharing the same father.\n\nAndrey Korotayev claimed that Islamization was a strong and significant predictor of parallel cousin (father's brother's daughter - FBD) marriage. He has shown that while there is a clear functional connection between Islam and FBD marriage, the prescription to marry a FBD does not appear to be sufficient to persuade people to marry thus, even if the marriage brings with it economic advantages. According to Korotayev, a systematic acceptance of parallel cousin marriage took place when Islamization occurred together with Arabization.\n\n\n"}

He was first elected as the MP for Newbury in 2005 and was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Benyon had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019 by prime minister Boris Johnson, after voting against the government, and sat as an independent MP until he had the whip restored by the prime minister on 28 October.\n\nBenyon studied at the Royal Agricultural College and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst before serving in the British Army, being posted to Northern Ireland and the Far East with the Royal Green Jackets. He was elected to Newbury Council in 1991 and became Conservative group leader in 1994.\n\nHe became Member of Parliament (MP) for Newbury at the 2005 general election. In opposition, he served on the Home Affairs Select committee, as an Opposition Whip and Shadow Minister for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). In government under David Cameron, he worked as Wildlife Minister at DEFRA from May 2010 to October 2013.\n\nBenyon was born on 21 October 1960 in Reading. He is the son of Sir William Richard Benyon, a Conservative Member of Parliament from 1970 until 1992, and is the great-great grandson of former Conservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. He was educated at nearby Bradfield College and the Royal Agricultural College.\n\nHaving attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Green Jackets, British Army, as a second lieutenant on 8 August 1981. He was promoted to lieutenant on 8 August 1983.\n\nDuring his four years' service, he was posted to Northern Ireland, the UK and the Far East. He transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers on 8 August 1984, thereby ending his military career but maintaining call-up liability.\n\nHe was elected in 1991 to Newbury District Council, and became Conservative group leader in 1994, in opposition to the then-ruling Liberal Democrats. He lost his council seat in 1995. He contested Newbury at the 1997 general election but lost heavily to the 1993 by-election incumbent Liberal Democrat David Rendel. Benyon and Rendel contested Newbury again at the 2001 general election, and Rendel came out again as the victor with a reduced majority. He and Rendel again contested Newbury at the 2005 UK general election and Benyon was elected with a majority of 3,460, replacing Rendel.\n\nBenyon made his maiden speech on 20 May 2005 and served on the Home Affairs Select committee from 2005 to 2007, when he became an Opposition Whip. He was the Shadow Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2009 until the 2010 general election when he entered government. He was also one of the first 15 MPs to support David Cameron's Conservative Party leadership bid.\n\nIn May 2009, he was listed by \"The Daily Telegraph\" as one of the \"saints\" in the expenses scandal exposed by that newspaper.\n\nHe was made Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the first Cameron Ministry. and remained in post until the junior and middle ranking Cameron reshuffle of October 2013.\n\nIn 2012, while Wildlife Minister he refused a request from other MPs that possession of carbofuran, a deadly poison used to kill raptors that is banned in Canada and the European Union, should be made a criminal offence. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas was quoted as saying: \"The minister's shocking refusal to outlaw the possession of a poison used only by rogue gamekeepers to illegally kill birds of prey would be inexplicable were it not for his own cosy links to the shooting lobby\".\n\nAlso in 2012, Benyon's neighbours complained when Hanson Aggregates were given permission to extract 200,000 tonnes of sand and gravel a year from woodlands on Benyon's family estate, leading it to be described as a bombsite. Benyon said that the estate was controlled by a family trust.\n\nIn 2013, Benyon succeeded in preventing any cuts in fishing quotas. He said that if British fishermen had their quotas cut they would dump even more fish overboard, and the more fish they are allowed to catch, the better it will be for \"the health of our seas\". Back in 2004, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution proposed that 30% of the United Kingdom's waters should become reserves preventing fishing or any other kind of extraction.\n\nAlso in 2013, Benyon's policy relating to access to rivers and his role as an owner of fishing rights was criticised. Writing in \"The Guardian\", George Monbiot wrote that Benyon \"repeatedly wields his power in ways that promote his own interests\" and being \"so enmeshed in potential conflicts of interest that were he to recuse himself from all the issues in which he has a personal stake, he would have nothing to do but order the departmental paperclips\".\n\nIn 2014, Benyon's family firm was part of a property consortium that purchased New Era estate, one of the last affordable housing estates for working-class Londoners. The consortium increased the rents and announced plans to increase them further to match the rest of the market, effectively displacing its current residents. Following negative publicity and protests by the tenants, Benyon Estate announced that it would sell its stake in the consortium back to the landlord, Westbrook Partners, a New York–based property investment company.\n\nBenyon was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 European Union membership referendum.\n\nIn 2017, Benyon was accused of nepotism by \"Private Eye\" after he hired his sister as a part-time senior researcher in his office just before a parliamentary ban on such practices came into force. In 2019 he was one of 21 Conservative MPs who lost the whip for supporting the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. He stood down in the general election called thereafter.\n\nHe married his first wife, Emma Helen Villiers in 1988; the couple had three children before divorcing in 2003. He presently lives in the family estate of Englefield House, with his second wife Zoe (née Robinson) and their two sons.\n\nBenyon is a director of the family controlled Englefield Charitable Trust, the largest private landowner in West Berkshire. He is one of nine Vice-Presidents of Berkshire County Scout Council.\n\nAccording to The \"Sunday Times Rich List\" in 2019, Benyon is worth £130 million.\n\nAccording to The Register of Members' Financial Interests, as at 21 January 2019, he is paid £15,000 per annum by the UK Water Partnership, a not-for-profit company set up to promote the interests of the UK water sector; and employs his sister, Catherine Haig, as a part-time Senior Researcher. He received donations amounting to £8,250 in 2018, from Philip Lavallin Wroughton (3 payments amounting to £7,000) and from Chris Gent (a single payment of £1,250).\n\nIn December 2017, Benyon was banned from driving after admitting to using a mobile phone while driving. Benyon had previously spoken out against that practice.\n\n"}

It is the third largest lake in the Adirondack Park (after Lake George and the Great Sacandaga Lake). About 75 percent of the shoreline is owned by State of New York; the Five Ponds Wilderness Area abuts its south shore, and the Cranberry Lake Wild Forest covers much of its remaining shoreline.\n\nMost of the lake is in the eastern end of the Town of Clifton, but a small part of the east side of the lake is in the Town of Piercefield and a small part of the west side of the lake is in the Town of Fine. The lake is entirely in the south part of Saint Lawrence County, New York.\n\nOn a north arm of the lake is the community of Cranberry Lake. On a western arm of the lake in the Town of Fine, is the community of Wanakena, among other things also location of the SUNY-ESF Ranger School.\n\nSeveral islands are within the lake, the largest being Joe Indian Island and Buck Island. The Cranberry Lake Biological Station, also part of SUNY-ESF, is located on Barber Point.\n\nA peninsula jutting into the lake from the north contains Bear Mountain and state camping facilities. One end of the Bear Mountain Trail leaves from campsite loop 3. The other end, a trail head with plenty of good parking, is located much closer to the campground entrance. The hike is fairly rigorous, but from start to the top it is only about . The lookout spot near the top provides a great view to the south and south west, mainly of Joe Indian and Buck islands.\n\nThere are several private camps on the lake's southern shore, including an island called, \"Chair Rock Island\". A large rock on Barber Point near the Biological Station bears an engraved memorial for international fly casting champion of the late 1800s, Reuben Wood, designer of the Reub Wood fishing flies.\n\nThere also exists a large camp setting called Wildcliffe Lodge (formerly \"Hoppies\" and then \"Verns\") that used to have an inn, bar and restaurant. The dining room was the former single room log cabin of Philo Scott, a hermit who married local resident Cordelia Stevens in 1856 and had eight children between 1858 and 1879 of Big Deer Pond. Chair Rock Lodge was another popular dining and lodging establishment on the South Shore, but both are now closed.\n\nThe Indian Mountain Club was also on the South Shore. \"Sports\" from downstate New York enjoyed dining, lodging and outdoor pursuits such as hunting, fishing, and shooting. A large garden provided fresh vegetables and remnants of this still exist on private property abutting the Five Ponds Wilderness.\n\n\nFish species present in the lake are smallmouth bass, brook trout, rock bass, yellow perch, brown bullhead, sunfish and brown trout. There is a state owned hard surface ramp on Route 3 by the outlet dam. There is also a state owned car top launch at the Cranberry Lake Campground and one more at the New York State Rangers School in Wanakena, New York. Lowville, New York.\n\nThe lake was named for the extensive cranberry bogs that it once contained. In 1865, the state authorized the building of a dam on the east branch of the Oswegatchie that doubled the lake's surface area and killed thousands of trees, the stumps of which still remain in some areas. In 1902, the Rich Brothers Lumber Company purchased on the southwestern shore of Cranberry Lake, and constructed a lumber mill. Housing for the millworkers was built in part from lumber salvaged from the company's abandoned Pennsylvania lumber operation. There were up to 1500 workers at the Rich Bros. mill and associated industries.\n\nA logging railroad was constructed connecting Wanakena to the Carthage & Adirondack Railroad at Benson Mines, starting operation in 1905. The railroad allowed tourists easy access to the area. In 1913, a second railroad called the Grasse River Railroad was built by the Emporium Lumber Company, connecting Cranberry Lake to the New York Central Railroad at Childwold Station near Conifer, NY.\n\nThe Rich Bros. Lumber Co. donated in the vicinity of Cranberry Lake to the New York State Ranger School in 1912. Businessman Charles Lathrop Pack donated of what today is the Cranberry Lake Biological Station to the New York State College of Forestry in 1923. Six years later, in 1929, the International Paper Company donated to the Ranger School. By 1940, the state had purchased most of the remaining lands of the former lumber companies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847576", "title": "Castle Hill convict rebellion", "text": "Castle Hill convict rebellion\n\nThe Castle Hill rebellion of 1804 was a rebellion by convicts against the colonial authority of the British colony of New South Wales in the Castle Hill area, in Sydney. The rebellion culminated in a battle fought between convicts and the colonial forces of Australia on 5 March 1804 at Rouse Hill, dubbed the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill after the first Battle of Vinegar Hill which had taken place in 1798 in Ireland. It was the first and only major convict uprising in Australian history suppressed under martial law.\n\nOn 4 March 1804, according to the official accounts, 233 convicts led by Philip Cunningham (a veteran of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, as well as a mutiny on the convict transport ship \"Anne\") escaped from a prison farm intent on \"capturing ships to sail to Ireland\". In response, martial law was quickly declared in the Colony of New South Wales. The mostly Irish rebels, having gathered reinforcements, were hunted by the colonial forces until they were caught on 5 March 1804 on a hillock nicknamed Vinegar Hill. While negotiating under a flag of truce, Cunningham was arrested. The troops then charged, and the rebellion was crushed. Nine of the rebel leaders were executed and hundreds were punished before martial law was finally revoked a week after the battle.\n\nMany convicts in the Castle Hill area had been involved in the 1798 rebellions in Ireland and subsequently transported as exiles-without-trial to the Colony of New South Wales from late 1799. Phillip Cunningham, a veteran of the 1798 rebellion, and William Johnston, another Irish convict at Castle Hill, planned an uprising in which over 685 convicts at Castle Hill intended to meet with nearly 1,100 convicts from the Hawkesbury River area, rally at Constitution Hill, and march on Parramatta and then Sydney (Port Jackson) itself. According to Helen Mackay, their goal was to establish Irish rule in the colony and obtain ships for those that wanted to return to Ireland to help revive the failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.\n\nOn the evening of 4 March 1804, John Cavenah set fire to his hut at Castle Hill at 8:00 as the signal for the rebellion to begin. While this fire was not seen by the convicts at Green Hills, today's Windsor, on the Hawkesbury River, Cunningham activated the plan to gather weapons, ammunition, food and recruits from local supporters and the government farm at Castle Hill. With Cunningham leading, about 200 to 300 rebels broke into the Government Farm's buildings, taking firearms, ammunition, and other weapons. The constables and overseers were overpowered and the rebels then went from farm to farm on their way to Constitution Hill at Parramatta, seizing more weapons and supplies including rum and spirits, and recruiting others to join their cause. Their move had been informed from the intelligence gathered a year previous when 12 convicts escaped from Castle Hill, seeking out friends and sympathisers in the surrounding districts. On capture each and every one had the same story – they were heading to China by crossing over the Blue Mountains.\n\nWhen news of the uprising spread there was great panic amongst the colony of around 5,000 inhabitants with officials such as Samuel Marsden fleeing the area by boat, escorting Elizabeth Macarthur and her children, as an informer had advised that an attack would be made on the farm to draw troops away from Parramatta. In Sydney, following news from Parramatta, Governor Philip Gidley King set off alone for Parramatta to assume command, while Lieutenant Colonel William Paterson, the lieutenant governor, called out the guard. One hundred and forty men from HMS \"Calcutta\", as well as the Sydney Loyal Association militia, took over guard duties, and a New South Wales Corps contingent of 56 personnel including Lieutenant William Davies and Quartermaster Sergeant Thomas Laycock were dispatched to march through the night to bolster the garrison at Parramatta. Meanwhile, the provost marshal, Thomas Smyth, was sent ahead to contact Major George Johnston at Annandale. The troops from Sydney arrived at 1:30 am, and after a quick inspection an advanced guard was sent to the west of the town. Johnston arrived at Government House in Parramatta about four hours later not long after King had declared martial law under the Mansfield doctrine of posse comitatus.\n\nKing's proclamation of martial law applied to a wide area extending from Castle Hill to the Hawkesbury and Nepean areas, and empowered citizens in the area to detain those who lacked the appropriate passes. A curfew had also been enacted and an amnesty declared, which gave those who were involved 24 hours to surrender. On Johnston's arrival at Parramatta, King delivered his orders, in writing, to Johnston and then verbally to his small detachment. Johnston was to proceed to the western gate of the park around Government House, where the rebels had been seen a few hours earlier. If they were not there, he was ordered to exploit towards Toongabbie and Castle Hill to locate them and then await further orders. He was also empowered to fire upon anyone who did not obey his directions.\n\nShortly after 5:00 am, Johnston set out to locate the main rebel force. In addition to the troops he had brought with him, a number of civilians volunteered along with the 36 armed members of the Parramatta Loyal Association militia were also called out and took over defence of the town. Over 50 enrolled in a reserve militia combined with the NSW Corps to march out and confront the rebels. Johnston decided to advance in two columns, one which he led himself towards Toongabbie, and another under a subaltern, Davies, which was sent along the Castle Hill Road.\n\nMeanwhile, the rebels at Constitution Hill (Toongabbie) were having difficulties co-ordinating their force as several parties, including one of around 70 men under Samuel Humes, had lost their way in the night. Nevertheless, Cunningham and William Johnston commenced drilling their men, while a party unsuccessfully tried to enter Parramatta, where they were to set fire to a building to signal other conspirators to begin converging on Constitution Hill. Cunningham, being involved in two previous rebellions and the mutiny on the \"Anne\", knew from experience that the most important element of a rebellion or uprising would be secrecy. However, there were two defections: an Irish convict overseer named Sloane, and Lewis Bulger. The commandant at Parramatta, Captain Edward Abbott, who had warning of the rebellion as it was happening, commenced defensive measures and sent a message to the governor in Sydney.\n\nWith their courier, John Griffen, having had second thoughts about passing on the instructions Cunningham had given him to pass on to Brian Furey and subsequently being arrested, the call out messages to Windsor, Parramatta and Sydney failed, and the uprising was confined to west of the Parramatta area. After fruitlessly waiting for a signal of a successful internal takeover of Parramatta, and the non-appearance of reinforcements, Cunningham was forced to withdraw from Parramatta to Toongabbie to re-assess his strategy. Having already declared his hand, and deprived of both surprise and facing a superior and well disciplined force of Red Coats and enthusiastic militia, the uprising under Cunningham had no recourse but to withdraw west towards the Hawkesbury hoping to pick up more recruits and meeting his missing forces on the way to add to his forces.\n\nKnowing that going forward would only see more death and possible routing, they quickly moved westward hoping to join up with those now heading east from Green Hills (Windsor) to meet in the area of today's Rouse Hill and Kellyville, recruiting or impressing against their will a number of convicts along the way. (Those later giving evidence stated they were press-ganged into service in hope of lessening their punishment.) During this phase they obtained around a third of the entire colony's armaments. Their numbers had dwindled to several hundred, eventually reaching a total of 233 as reported in the Government controlled newspaper of the time. During the short period of the rebellion while at Constitution Hill, Cunningham was elected \"King of the Australian Empire\", and his followers declared the area \"New Ireland\".\n\nMajor Johnston's contingent, wearied by their night march, needed time to close with the retreating rebels, who were reported to number around 400, so he rode after them with a small mounted party to implement delaying tactics, while the rest of his party completed the march to Toongabbie. Initially, it was believed that the rebels were at Toongabbie, but on arrival Johnston was informed that they had moved on to Constitution Hill. A small party under a corporal was sent to outflank this position, while an assault force of around a dozen men advanced on the summit, only to find it abandoned, with the rebels having moved off towards the Hawkesbury, about away. As the morning progressed, the heat of the day threatened to stymie the efforts of the marching troops who were poorly equipped for the pursuit. Nevertheless, about from Toongabbie, Johnston located the main rebel party of around 230 to 260 men near Rouse Hill, Johnston first sent his mounted trooper on to call the rebels to surrender and take the benefit of the Governor's amnesty for early surrender. This failing, he dispatched Roman Catholic priest Father James Dixon to appeal to them. Next he rode up himself, appealing to them, then got their agreement to hear Father Dixon again.\n\nMeanwhile, the pursuing forces had closed up and Major Johnston with Trooper Thomas Anlezark, from the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse, approached them again to parley, calling down the leaders Cunningham and William Johnston from the hill. Demanding their surrender, he received the response \"Death or Liberty\" from Cunningham, to which some were reported to have added \"and a ship to take us home\", although this was only once recorded some time later by Suttor.\n\nWith the NSW Corps and militia now formed up in firing lines behind him Major Johnston and Anlezark produced pistols duping, while under truce, the two leaders of the uprising, and escorting them back to the Red Coat's lines. Quartermaster Sergeant Thomas Laycock, on being given the order to engage, directed over fifteen minutes of musket fire, then charged cutting Cunningham down with his cutlass. The now leaderless rebels first tried to fire back, but then broke and dispersed.\n\nDuring the battle (at least) fifteen rebels had fallen, according to official reports, Major Johnston prevented further bloodshed and killings by threatening his troops with his pistol tempering their enthusiasm. Several convicts were captured and an unknown number killed in the pursuit which went up to Windsor all day until late in the night, with new arrivals of soldiers from Sydney joining in the search for rebels. It is reported that gun shots could be heard up to a fortnight after such was the settling of old scores. On Wednesday, 7 March Governor King announced that those that surrendered before 10 March would receive leniency and following this large parties who lost their way in the night turned themselves in under the amnesty or made their way back to Castle Hill where a large party of about 70 under Samuel Humes were captured by a detachment of the Loyal Parramatta Association.\n\nAccording to the official records of the day, around 230 were eventually brought in over next few days and of the convicts directly engaged in the battle, 15 were killed, and 9 including the ringleaders Cunningham and Johnston were executed, with two, Johnson and Humes, subjected to gibbeting. Two men, John Burke and Bryan McCormack, were reprieved and detained at the Governor's pleasure, seven were whipped with 200 or 500 lashes then allotted to the Coal River chain gang, while 23 others, including Cavenah were sent to the Newcastle coal mines. Another 34 prisoners were placed in irons until they could be \"disposed of\". It is not known whether some, or all of them, were sent to the Coal River. Of the remaining rebels, some were put on good behaviour orders against a trip to Norfolk Island, while the majority were pardoned and allowed to return to their places of employment as having been coerced into the uprising.\n\nCunningham, badly wounded but still alive, was court martialled under the martial law and hanged at the Commissariat Store at Windsor, which he had bragged he would burn down. Initially, military officers were intent on hanging a token number of those captured having convened a military court at the Whipping Green but this was quickly stopped by Governor Gidley King fearful of the repercussions.\n\nMartial law was eventually lifted on 10 March 1804, but this did not end the insurgency. Irish plots continued to develop, keeping the Government and its informers vigilant, with military call out rehearsals continuing over the next three years. Governor King remained convinced that the real inspirers of revolt had kept out of sight, and had some suspects sent to Norfolk Island as a preventive measure.\n\nThe battle site is believed to be to the east of the site of the Rouse Hill Estate, and it is likely that Richard Rouse, a staunch establishment figure, was subsequently given his grant at this site specifically to prevent it becoming a significant site for Irish convicts. \"The Government Farm at Castle Hill\", a plot of land around , was added in March 1986 to the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate, as a special place of international and Australian significance. Residential development has significantly diminished the area of the prison town. Less than has remained undeveloped and conserved, as Castle Hill Heritage Park, established in 2004. There is a sculpture near the battle site at Castlebrook Cemetery commemorating the sacrifice. However, there is some debate as to where the battle actually occurred.\n\nThe bicentenary of the rebellion was commemorated in 2004, with a variety of events. The re-enactment in 2004 was significant in that exact numbers were recruited to form the rebels, the militia and the military. The event was held in close proximity to the original site on a similar landscape. The re-enactment was recorded by the ABC.\n\nIn addition, the battle has been depicted on screen. An Australian 1978 TV series, \"Against the Wind\", included a dramatization over two episodes of the build-up to and ultimate defeat of the rebellion. A monument commemorating the battle was erected at Castlebrook Memorial Park, on Windsor Road, Rouse Hill. It was dedicated on 5 March 1988.\n\n\n"}

Engel left the Work and Pensions Committee in November 2007. She performed the same role for Liam Byrne from October 2008, transferring to work for John Denham from January 2009. She was appointed to the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons when it was set up in July 2009.\n\nEngel did not agree with the committee's report, which contained proposals for the creation of a committee to schedule backbench business, the establishment of a committee to set the Commons' agenda and the election of select committee chairs by secret ballot. She felt those three changes would transfer power 'from one elite—in this case, the Executive—and handing it to another—a group of senior Back Benchers'. She also said they would be 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially be telling themselves and the public 'we've done [reform], we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would have more time to investigate and deliberate.\n\nOn 15 June 2010, the House of Commons voted to create a Backbench Business Committee, and one week later, Engel defeated Sir Alan Haselhurst 202 to 173 in a secret ballot of MPs to become its first chair. On 6 July 2011 she was named \"Backbencher of the Year\" for her work with the committee. Interviewed in the April 2012 edition of \"Total Politics\", Engel expressed surprise at her status in being pictured alongside that of the Coalition leaders and the Speaker in an exhibition on democracy.\n\nEngel's role was to allocate roughly one day a week parliamentary debating time between competing backbenchers by a process described by Quentin Letts as akin to \"Dragons' Den\". She has expressed pride in the committee which is \"a powerful check on the executive\". Debates are allowed on any topic and, unless they are against party policy, the whips don't interfere. The most contentious debate was on the EU referendum held on 24 October 2011. Engel is producing an 'end-of-term' report on the performance of the committee and recommendations for improvement—a review is required as part of recommendations of the Wright Committee.\nEngel was re-elected, unopposed, to the chair of the committee May 2012.\n\nAlthough Engel \"occasionally rebels\" against the Labour party whip, she voted \"very strongly\" against an Iraq war inquiry and also voted \"very strongly\" for replacing Trident.\n\nIn February 2007, Engel introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill which proposed to require doctors to supply free condoms at their surgeries, noting that the Bill had the support of the Family Planning Association, Terrence Higgins Trust, Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Nursing. She took a period of maternity leave from December 2007. Engel was one of the fifteen MPs to formally nominate John Bercow as the new Speaker of the House of Commons in the election in June 2009. She became chair of the All-Party Insolvency Group in 2009.\n\nEngel collaborated on a chapter in the Institute for Public Policy Research book \"Politics for a New Generation\" in 2007 which was titled \"Moving on up: Progression in the Labour Market\". In October 2008 Engel called for Labour MPs to be given a free vote on the issue of banning smacking of children, complaining that she was put in an \"impossible position of choosing between party loyalty and a reform that we believe in passionately\".\n\nEngel represents the Labour Party on the Board of Trustees of the UK Youth Parliament and has worked to encourage young people to participate in democracy. With her local council she set up a 'Question Time' event for local pupils to question a panel including then-cabinet member Geoff Hoon and the leader of the council. In December 2007, she was a sponsor of a Private member's bill introduced by Julie Morgan which would have reduced the voting age to 16. Engel became chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs in 2008. In a Fabian Society survey of some Labour MPs in Autumn 2007, Engel's suggestion for the next Labour general election manifesto was for sex and relationship education to be compulsory in all schools and taught by a professional.\n\nAt the ePolitix Charity Champion awards in November 2007, Engel was named \"Children and Youth Champion\" for her work. At the 2007–08 annual general meeting of the British Youth Council, she was chosen as an Honorary President of the council.\n\nIn May 2009, during the expenses scandal the \"Derby Telegraph\" contacted all the MPs in Derbyshire for their opinion of the issues raised. Engel provided the \"Derbyshire Times\" with all her claim forms.\nThe paper subsequently invited other members of parliament within its circulation area to do the same but only the neighbouring Amber Valley MP Judy Mallaber accepted.\n\"The Sunday Telegraph\", published ten days later, showed that after her election in 2005, Engel claimed £158.45 incidental expenses for \"political history\" items, some of which she told the paper she would repay.\n\nAlso in 2005, she advised the Fees office of above limits second home claims, paying the excess though £1,666 worth of kitchen goods were paid in full.\nShe admitted that with hindsight she would not have claimed for some kitchen items which were \"the letter... not the spirit, of the law\". However, she cited costs of setting up a second home and a constituency office, and said she had paid out the money and had not acted corruptly, so she would not be repaying it.\n\nFollowing the publication, Engel set up meetings to answer questions though these were not well attended.\n\n\"The Sunday Telegraph\"s claim that Engel came low on the list of 'value for money' MPs was itself criticised by \"The Guardian\" for failing to mention that Engel had two periods of maternity leave whilst Engel herself wrote an article linking the expenses and hours of Parliament to the difficulties of raising a young family. \"The expenses debate... has forced MPs to talk to the people they represent... Only when people realise that we split our time between constituency and Westminster can they begin to understand why we even have a second-home allowance.\"\n\nThe \"Legg Report\" showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay money, including several from Derbyshire. Engel repaid £1,934 of which she said £1,339 was a mortgage claim the Fees office paid twice which she repaid immediately whilst £595 was a refund of a house rental deposit.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, Engel's majority of 1,883 was the 17th-smallest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage. She had been expected to lose but she retained her seat.\n\nEngel supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum.\n\nIn explanation of her eventual defeat in the 2017 general election, Engel pointed to problems in Labour gaining votes in its post-industrial heartlands and the absence of a significant student vote in the constituency, comparing the situation with her native Canterbury where Labour had gained the seat in the election for the first time.\n\nMany in North East Derbyshire were of the opinion that her stance on fracking was the root cause of her defeat, having published a letter in support of fracking (against the national Party policy) immediately after the close of nominations for the Labour candidacy. North East Derbyshire has a large anti-fracking movement due to proposed developments by the chemicals company Ineos, and Engel's nomination had been signed by some anti-fracking activists.\n\nAfter losing her seat in the election it was announced that Engel had taken a job as a consultant to a firm involved in fracking with Ineos. The North East Derbyshire Labour Party have strongly condemned her actions and are considering their options in relation to her status within the party, though she was replaced as the Labour candidate for the area by anti-fracking Sheffield councillor Christine Peace.\n\nOn 5 October 2018 the Conservative government announced Engel as the new commissioner for shale gas. According to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy she \"will be a direct communication link between local communities, the shale gas industry and the industry regulators.\" As fracking tsar she said that people opposing fracking were 'hysterical' and had 'knee jerk reactions': \"\"Environment lobbyists and campaigners should be fracking’s number one fans. They should be pushing the government to get fracking while we try and bridge that gap between the renewable energy that we’re using at the moment which is absolutely negligible.\"\"\n\nOn 28 April 2019, she resigned as fracking tsar giving an interview to \"The Mail on Sunday\" saying that the requirement that fracking be shut down in the event of earth tremors measuring 0.5 on the Richter magnitude scale was \"making fracking impossible\".\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", Engel was quoted in her resignation as saying that \"The UK is currently spending £7bn a year on importing gas – money that is not being used to build schools, hospitals or fix the potholes in our roads\", despite the fact that the British Government does not itself procure gas, given that the energy industry was privatised several decades before; further to this, any UK oil or gas production is taxed by the government, and such production improves both the balance of trade (by supplanting some gas imports) and national GDP.\n\nIn 2012, she and her veterinary surgeon husband divorced; they have three sons.\n\n"}

The lectures present scientific subjects to a general audience, including young people, in an informative and entertaining manner. Michael Faraday initiated the Christmas Lecture series in 1825, at a time when organised education for young people was scarce. Faraday presented nineteen series of lectures in all.\n\nThe Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures were first held in 1825, and have continued on an annual basis since then except during the Second World War. They have been hosted each year at the Royal Institution itself, except in 1929 and between 2005–2006, each time due to refurbishment of the building. They were created by Michael Faraday, who later hosted the lecture season on nineteen occasions. The Nobel laureate Sir William Bragg gave the Christmas lectures on four occasions, and his co-laureate son Sir Lawrence Bragg gave them twice. Other notable lecturers have included Desmond Morris (1964), Eric Laithwaite (1966 & 1974), Sir George Porter (1969 & 1976), Sir David Attenborough (1973), Heinz Wolff (1975), Carl Sagan (1977), Richard Dawkins (1991), Baroness Susan Greenfield (1994), Dame Nancy Rothwell (1998), Monica Grady (2003), Sue Hartley (2009), Alison Woollard (2013), Danielle George (2014), and Saiful Islam (2016).\n\nThe props for the lectures are designed and created by the RI's science demonstration technician, a post which Faraday previously held. A popular technician, with the advent of television, serving from 1948 to 1986, was Bill Coates. The technician is informed of the general subject of the lectures during spring, but the specifics aren't settled until September, with the recordings made in mid-December. By 2009, the lectures had expanded to a series of five sessions each year. However, in 2010 the Royal Institution cut back on costs as it had become over £2 million in debt. These cost-cutting measures included the budget allotted to the Christmas Lectures. This resulted in a reduction from five sessions to three.\n\nThe Christmas Lectures were first televised in 1936 on the BBC's fledgling Television Service. They were broadcast on BBC Two from 1966 to 1999 and Channel 4 from 2000 to 2004. In 2000 one of the lectures was broadcast live for the first time. Following the end of Channel 4's contract to broadcast the lectures, there were concerns that they might simply be dropped from scheduling as the channel was negotiating with the Royal Institution over potential changes to the format, while the BBC announced that \"The BBC will not show the lectures again, because it feels the broadcasting environment has moved on in the last four years.\" Channel Five subsequently agreed to show the lectures from 2005 to 2008, an announcement which was met with derision from academics. The lectures were broadcast on More4 in 2009. In 2010, the lectures returned to the BBC after a ten-year absence from the broadcaster, and have been shown on BBC Four each year since then.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the Christmas Lectures from 1825 to 1965:\n\nThe following is a list of televised Christmas Lectures from 1966 onward :\n"}
{"id": "1847605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847605", "title": "George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River", "text": "George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River\n\nGeorge Washington's crossing of the Delaware River, which occurred on the night of December 25–26, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, was the first move in a surprise attack organized by George Washington against the Hessian (German mercenaries in service of the British) forces in Trenton, New Jersey, on the morning of December 26. Planned in partial secrecy, Washington led a column of Continental Army troops across the icy Delaware River in a logistically challenging and dangerous operation. Other planned crossings in support of the operation were either called off or ineffective, but this did not prevent Washington from surprising and defeating the troops of Johann Rall quartered in Trenton. The army crossed the river back to Pennsylvania, this time laden with prisoners and military stores taken as a result of the battle.\n\nWashington's army then crossed the river a third time at the end of the year, under conditions made more difficult by the uncertain thickness of the ice on the river. They defeated British reinforcements under Lord Cornwallis at Trenton on January 2, 1777, and defeated his rear guard at Princeton on January 3, before retreating to winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey.\n\nThe unincorporated communities of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Washington Crossing, New Jersey, are named in honor of this event.\n\nWhile 1776 had started well for the American cause with the evacuation of British troops from Boston in March, the defense of New York City had gone quite poorly. British General William Howe had landed troops on Long Island in August and had pushed George Washington's Continental Army completely out of New York by mid-November, when he captured the remaining troops on Manhattan. The main British troops returned to New York for the winter season. They left mainly Hessian troops in New Jersey. These troops were under the command of Colonel Rall and Colonel Von Donop. They were ordered to small outposts in and around Trenton. Howe then sent troops under the command of Charles Cornwallis across the Hudson River into New Jersey and chased Washington across New Jersey. Washington's army was shrinking because of expiring enlistments and desertions, and suffered from poor morale because of the defeats in the New York area. Most of Washington's army crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania north of Trenton, New Jersey, and destroyed or moved to the western shore all boats for miles in both directions. Cornwallis (under Howe's command), rather than attempting to immediately chase Washington further, established a chain of outposts from New Brunswick to Burlington, including one at Bordentown and one at Trenton, and ordered his troops into winter quarters. The British were happy to end the campaign season when they were ordered to winter quarters. This was a time for the generals to regroup, re-supply, and strategize for the upcoming campaign season the following spring.\n\nWashington encamped the army near McConkey's Ferry, not far from the crossing site. While Washington at first took quarters across the river from Trenton, he moved his headquarters on December 15 to the home of William Keith so he could remain closer to his forces. When Washington's army first arrived at McConkey's Ferry, he had four to six thousand men, although 1,700 soldiers were unfit for duty and needed hospital care. In the retreat across New Jersey, Washington had lost precious supplies and also lost contact with two important divisions of his army. General Horatio Gates was in the Hudson River Valley, and General Charles Lee was in western New Jersey with 2,000 men. Washington had ordered both generals to join him, but Gates was delayed by heavy snows en route, and Lee, who did not have a high opinion of Washington, delayed following repeated orders, preferring to remain on the British flank near Morristown, New Jersey.\n\nOther problems affected the quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire at the end of the year, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were completed. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful partially because of British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.\n\nThe losses at Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy toll on the Patriots. When they evacuated their forts, they were forced to leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the morale of the remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.\n\nBut the morale of the Patriot forces was boosted on December 19 when a new pamphlet titled \"The American Crisis\" written by Thomas Paine, the author of \"Common Sense\", was published.\n\nWithin a day of its publication in Philadelphia, General Washington ordered it to be read to all of his troops. It encouraged the soldiers and improved the tolerance of their difficult conditions.\n\nOn December 20, General Lee's division of 2,000 troops arrived in Washington's camp under the command of General John Sullivan. General Lee had been captured by the British on December 12, when he ventured too far outside the protection of his troops in search of more comfortable lodgings (or, according to rumors, a possible assignation). Later that same day, General Gates' division arrived in camp, reduced to 600 whose enlistments had ended, and by the need to keep the northern frontier secure. Soon after, another 1,000 militiamen from Philadelphia under Colonel John Cadwalader joined Washington.\n\nWith these reinforcements and smaller numbers of local volunteers who joined his forces, Washington's forces now totaled about 6,000 troops fit for duty. This total was then reduced by a large portion because some forces were detailed to guard the ferries at Dunk's Ferry (currently bordered by Neshaminy State Park in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania and New Hope, Pennsylvania). Another group was sent to protect supplies at Newtown, Pennsylvania, and to guard the sick and wounded who had to remain behind when the army crossed the Delaware River. This left Washington with about 2,400 men able to take offensive action against the Hessian and British troops in central New Jersey.\n\nThis improvement in morale was aided by the arrival of some provisions, including much-needed blankets, on December 24.\n\nGeneral Washington had been considering some sort of bold move since arriving in Pennsylvania. With the arrival of Sullivan's and Gates' forces and the influx of militia companies, he felt the time was finally right for some sort of action. He first considered an attack on the southernmost British positions near Mount Holly, where a militia force had gathered. He sent his adjutant, Joseph Reed, to meet with Samuel Griffin, the militia commander. Reed arrived in Mount Holly on December 22, found Griffin to be ill and his men in relatively poor condition, but willing to make some sort of diversion. (This they did with the Battle of Iron Works Hill the next day, drawing the Hessians at Bordentown far enough south that they would be unable to come to the assistance of the Trenton garrison.) The intelligence gathered by Reed and others led Washington to abandon the idea of attacking at Mount Holly, preferring instead to target the Trenton garrison. He announced this decision to his staff on December 23, saying the attack would take place just before daybreak on December 26.\n\nWashington's final plan was for three crossings, with his troops, the largest contingent, to lead the attack on Trenton. A second column under Cadwalader was to cross at Dunk's Ferry and create a diversion to the south. A third column under Brigadier General James Ewing was to cross at Trenton Ferry and hold the bridge across the Assunpink Creek, just south of Trenton, in order to prevent the enemy's escape by that route. Once Trenton was secure, the combined army would move against the British posts in Princeton and New Brunswick. A planned fourth crossing, by men provided by General Israel Putnam to assist Cadwalader, was nixed after Putnam indicated he did not have enough men fit for the operation.\n\nPreparations for the attack began on December 23. On December 24, the boats used to bring the army across the Delaware from New Jersey were brought down from Malta Island near New Hope. They were hidden behind Taylor Island at McConkey's Ferry, Washington's planned crossing site; security was tightened at the crossing. A final planning meeting took place that day, with all of the general officers present. General orders were issued by Washington on December 25 outlining plans for the operation.\n\nA wide variety of watercraft were assembled for the crossing, primarily through the work of militia men from the surrounding counties in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the assistance of the Pennsylvania Navy.\n\nCaptain Daniel Bray, along with Captain Jacob Gearhart and Captain Jacob Ten Eyck, were chosen by Washington to take charge of the boats used in the crossing, supervising the transport of infantry, cavalry, cannon.\nIn addition to the large ferry vessels (which were big enough to carry large coaches, and likely served for carrying horses and artillery during the crossing), a large number of Durham boats were used to transport soldiers across the river. These boats were designed to carry heavy loads from the Durham Iron Works, featured high sides and a shallow draft, and could be poled across the river.\n\nThe boats were operated by experienced watermen. Most prominent among them were the men of John Glover's Marblehead Regiment, a company of experienced seamen from Marblehead, Massachusetts. These men were joined by seamen, dockworkers, and shipbuilders from Philadelphia, as well as local ferry operators and boatsmen who knew the river well.\n\nOn the morning of December 25, Washington ordered his army to prepare three days' food and issued orders that every soldier be outfitted with fresh flints for their muskets. He was also somewhat worried by intelligence reports that the British were planning their own crossing once the Delaware was frozen over. At 4 pm Washington's army turned out for its evening parade, where the troops were issued ammunition, and even the officers and musicians were ordered to carry muskets. They were told that they were departing on a secret mission. Marching eight abreast in close formations and ordered to be as quiet as possible, they left the camp for McConkey's Ferry. Washington's plan required the crossing to begin as soon as it was dark enough to conceal their movements on the river, but most of the troops did not reach the crossing point until about 6 pm, about ninety minutes after sunset. The weather got progressively worse, turning from drizzle to rain to sleet and snow. \"It blew a hurricane,\" recalled one soldier.\nWashington had given charge of the crossing logistics to his chief of artillery, Henry Knox. In addition to the crossing of large numbers of troops (most of whom could not swim), he had to safely transport horses and eighteen pieces of artillery over the river. Knox wrote that the crossing was accomplished \"with almost infinite difficulty\", and that its most significant danger was floating ice in the river. One observer noted that the whole operation might well have failed \"but for the stentorian lungs of Colonel Knox\". The unusually cold weather of the 1770s and the icy river were likely related to the Little Ice Age.\n\nWashington was among the first of the troops to cross, going with Virginia troops led by General Adam Stephen. These troops formed a sentry line around the landing area in New Jersey, with strict instructions that no one was to pass through. The password was \"Victory or Death\". The rest of the army crossed without significant incident, although a few men, including Delaware's Colonel John Haslet, fell into the water.\n\nThe amount of ice on the river prevented the artillery from finishing the crossing until 3 am on December 26. The troops were ready to march around 4 am.\nThe two other crossings fared less well. The treacherous weather and ice jams on the river stopped General Ewing from even attempting a crossing below Trenton. Colonel Cadwalader crossed a significant portion of his men to New Jersey, but when he found that he could not get his artillery across the river he recalled his men from New Jersey. When he received word about Washington's victory, he crossed his men over again but retreated when he found out that Washington had not stayed in New Jersey.\n\nOn the morning of December 26, as soon as the army was ready, Washington ordered it split into two columns, one under the command of himself and General Greene, the second under General Sullivan. The Sullivan column would take River Road from Bear Tavern to Trenton while Washington's column would follow Pennington Road, a parallel route that lay a few miles inland from the river. Only three Americans were killed and six wounded, while 22 Hessians were killed with 98 wounded. The Americans captured 1,000 prisoners and seized muskets, powder, and artillery. \n\nFollowing the battle, Washington had to execute a second crossing that was in some ways more difficult than the first. In the aftermath of the battle, the Hessian supplies had been plundered, and, in spite of Washington's explicit orders for its destruction, casks of captured rum were opened, so some of the celebrating troops got drunk, probably contributing to the larger number of troops that had to be pulled from the icy waters on the return crossing. They also had to transport the large numbers of prisoners across the river while keeping them under guard. One American acting as a guard on one of the crossings observed that the Hessians, who were standing in knee-deep ice water, were \"so cold that their underjaws quivered like an aspen leaf.\"\n\nThe victory had a marked effect on the troops' morale. Soldiers celebrated the victory, Washington's role as a leader was secured, and Congress gained renewed enthusiasm for the war.\n\nIn a war council on December 27, Washington learned that all of the British and Hessian forces had withdrawn as far north as Princeton, something Cadwalader had learned when his militia company crossed the river that morning. In his letter, Cadwalader proposed that the British could be driven entirely from the area, magnifying the victory. After much debate, the council decided on action and planned a third crossing for December 29. On December 28 it snowed, but the weather cleared that night and it became bitter cold. As this effort involved most of the army, eight crossing points were used. At some of crossing points, the ice had frozen two to three inches (4 to 7 cm) thick and was capable of supporting soldiers, who crossed the ice on foot. At other crossings, the conditions were so bad that the attempts were abandoned for the day. It was New Year's Eve before the army and all of its baggage was back in New Jersey. This was somewhat fortunate, as the enlistment period of John Glover's regiment (along with a significant number of others) was expiring at the end of the year, and many of these men, including most of Glover's, wanted to go home, where a lucrative privateering trade awaited them. Only by offering a bounty to be paid immediately from Congressional coffers in Philadelphia did a significant number of men agree to stay with the army another six weeks.\n\nWashington then adopted a fortified position just south of the Assunpink Creek, across the creek from Trenton. In this position he beat back one assault on January 2, 1777, which he followed up with a decisive victory at Princeton the next day. In the following days, the British withdrew to New Brunswick, and the Continental Army entered winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey.\n\nAt the time of the crossing, Washington's army included a significant number of people who played important roles in the formation and early days of the United States of America. These included future President James Monroe, future Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, Alexander Hamilton (a future Secretary of the Treasury), and Arthur St. Clair, who later served as President of the Continental Congress and Governor of the Northwest Territory.\n\nBoth sides of the Delaware River where the crossing took place have been preserved, in an area designated as the Washington's Crossing National Historic Landmark. In this district, Washington Crossing Historic Park in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, preserves the area in Pennsylvania, and Washington Crossing State Park in Washington Crossing, New Jersey preserves the area in New Jersey. The two areas are connected by the Washington Crossing Bridge.\n\nIn 1851, the artist Emmanuel Leutze created the painting, \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\", an idealized and inspirational portrayal of the crossing. Fictional portrayals in film of the crossing have also been made, with perhaps the most notable recent one being \"The Crossing\", a 2000 television movie starring Jeff Daniels as George Washington.\n\n\n\n"}

He is remembered for having been called the \"father of the ballot\" due to his responsibility in introducing the secret ballot in Victoria.\n\nNicholson was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, the son of an Anglican farmer. At the age of twenty six, in 1842, he emigrated to Australia, setting up business as a grocer in Melbourne. He was a successful businessman and became the head of a merchant firm, W. Nicholson and Company. In 1848 Nicholson was elected to the Melbourne City Council, and served as Mayor of Melbourne (1850–51). He was also a director of the Bank of Victoria and several other companies.\n\nIn 1852, Nicholson won another election, to the Legislative Council for North Bourke. In 1853, he became a member of the committee which drafted the Constitution of Victoria, and on 18 December 1855, Nicholson moved and carried a motion which stated that any Victorian electoral act should include voting by secret ballot. This move was opposed by the government at the time, under Premier William Haines, and after the motion was passed, Haines resigned.\n\nAlthough it was actually Henry Chapman who devised the secret ballot motion, the fact that Nicholson moved it, gained him the credit, and when Haines resigned, he was invited by the Governor of Victoria Sir Charles Hotham to form a government, but he was unable to do so, and Haines became Premier again.\n\nIn 1856, Nicholson visited England, where he was congratulated for his work in establishing the secret ballot, which had been advocated by the Chartist movement there. The system was introduced in Victoria on 19 March 1856, and in South Australia on 2 April in the same year. It was later adopted by all the other colonies. The secret ballot was known as \"the Victorian ballot\" for the rest of the 19th century.\n\nNicholson returned to Melbourne in 1858, and in 1859 was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the seat of Murray. Later that year, he shifted to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), which he represented until 1864. When the conservative government of Premier John O'Shanassy was defeated in October 1859, Nicholson became Premier and Chief Secretary.\n\nMuch of Nicholson's premiership was spent trying to pass a bill which would have allowed small farmers to settle on the grazing lands appropriated by the squatters, but it encountered strong opposition from the Legislative Council, which was dominated by landowners. When the Council severely amended the bill there were riots outside Parliament House. This stiffened conservative resistance and the bill was eventually passed in a much weaker form, which the squatters easily evaded. This failure led to Nicholson's resignation in November 1860.\n\nNicholson did not hold office again. Parallel to his serving as the premier of Victoria, however, he also fulfilled the duties of Chairman of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. In 1860 he also held his third office, that of the Secretary of the Royal Society of Victoria.\n\nIn January 1864, William Nicholson became severely ill and, unable to fully recover, died in little more than a year, less than two weeks after his forty-ninth birthday. He was survived by his wife Sarah Burkitt, \"née\" Fairclough, and four sons. Nicholson Street, a major north–south traffic artery in modern Melbourne, is named after him.\n\n"}

It is the first of seven novels in the \"Shadow Children\" series. In 2013 it was one of the ten most taught texts in United States' middle schools.\n\nIn a dystopian future, after a shortage of food and overpopulation, families are limited to two children.\n\nLuke Garner, a 13-year-old boy, lives on a farm with his mother, father, and two brothers. As a third child, Luke and his parents are in violation of a law called the population law. Luke, like all third children, must spend his days hidden or away from public view, or else they will be killed or imprisoned, as well as their families. When the government starts building houses in the woods behind the Garners' house for rich, elite people who are Government officials, Luke is forced to hide in his house. During the day, when Luke's brothers are at school, and his parents are at work, Luke is home alone.\n\nOne day, Luke sees the face of a child in a window of a house that he knows already has two children. About a month later, he secretly runs over to the house out of curiosity and is caught by Jen, the child who he saw in the window. She reveals that she is also a Shadow Child, a third child, just like Luke. Jen introduces Luke to a chatroom on her computer where he meets other Shadow Children like him. Jen and Luke become friends and Luke visits Jen as much as he can.\n\nJen, who strongly disagrees with the Government, shows Luke books that explain what the Government is doing wrong. He takes these books home. Luke feels guilty for being born because the books tell him that Shadow Children use up resources that other people and animals are supposed to use. Luke then learns about the upcoming rally. Luke finally confesses that he doesn't want to go because he is too afraid. Jen, who feels betrayed, gets upset and tells him to leave as she doesn't need him anymore. He is annoyed and angry at Jen and wishes that the Population Police would shoot her during the rally. After thinking that, he realizes that he shouldn't have thought that.\n\nThe next morning, Luke is paranoid about what has happened. There has been no report of any rally. Growing more afraid of what may have happened to Jen, after a few months, he breaks into her home again, but there is no sign of her. He runs into the computer room and logs into the chatroom. He sends a message in the chatroom asking where Jen is, but there is no reply.\n\nOvercome with his emotions, he reacts too slow as the door opens and a man steps into the room with a gun. He asks who Luke is and how he knows Jen's identity. Luke reveals himself as another Shadow Child who is friends with Jen. He demands to know where Jen is. The man, who is Jen's father, lowers the gun. Unexpectedly, he breaks into tears.\n\nHe explains that Jen and all forty other children were shot and killed in the rally. Luke asks where were the other children because he was told that there would be a thousand. Mr. Talbot explains that she had too much faith in the other children.\n\nThe Population Police suddenly turn up and demand to come in. The chatroom Luke had sent messages in had been secretly monitored after the rally. Luke hides while Mr. Talbot, who is revealed to be working for the Population Police as well, sorts things out. Mr. Talbot is on Luke's side and wants to avenge his daughter.\n\nMr. Talbot forges a fake I.D. for Luke, so he can travel far away. Luke begins a new life as Lee Grant. He gets sent to a boarding school miles away from his farm and family, where he begins his new life.\n"}

Population: 6,713 (1897).\n\nTwo important treaties between the Russian Empire and Manchu China mention Nerchinsk: the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk and the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta. Non-Russian comments on these treaties or on the history of the town may mention other names:\n\nThe fort of Nerchinsk dates from 1654. founded the town four years later; in that year he opened direct communication between the Russian settlements in Transbaikalia and those on the Amur River which had been founded by Cossacks and fur-traders from the Yakutsk region. In 1689 Russia and China signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which stopped the farther advance of the Russians into the basin of the Amur for two centuries (see Sino-Russian border conflicts).\n\nAfter that, Nerchinsk became the chief center for Russian trade with China. The opening of the western route through Mongolia, via Urga, and the establishment of a custom-house at Kyakhta in 1728 diverted this trade into a new channel. But Nerchinsk acquired fresh importance from the influx of immigrants, mostly exiles, into eastern Dauria, from the discovery of rich mines and from the arrival of great numbers of convicts to the Nerchinsk katorga. Ultimately Nerchinsk became the chief town of Transbaikalia.\n\nThe famous English adventurer and engineer Samuel Bentham visited Nerchinsk in 1782. Bentham had seen a potential for Nerchinsk as a base for access to the Sea of Okhotsk, provided the Chinese would authorize navigation on the Amur River. Such a venture would have opened up the possibility of fur trade with the Pacific Ocean, as far as the Chinese port of Canton.\n\nIn 1812, Nerchinsk was transferred from the banks of the Shilka to its present site, on account of floods. The town relinquished its supremacy to Chita in the late 19th century, when the Trans-Siberian Railway bypassed it.\n\nAccording to George Kennan, \"a few of the Decembrist conspirators of 1825\" and \"thousands of Polish insurgents\" from their unsuccessful insurrection of 1863\" were transported to the Nerchinsk silver-mining district.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Nerchinsk was built of wood, and its lower areas frequently suffered from inundations. The inhabitants supported themselves mainly by agriculture, tobacco-growing and cattle-breeding; a few merchants traded in furs and cattle, in brick-tea from China, and in manufactured wares from Russia. Gold-mines in the vicinity were owned and developed by the Butin family of merchants, whose Neo-Moorish palace now stands in disrepair.\n\n Nerchinsk is home to some small electromechanical and food-processing industries. It has a small museum, established in 1884. Among its sights are the Resurrection Cathedral, built in the Neoclassical style in 1825 to commemorate the city's relocation, its belltower destroyed by the Communists. The site of old Nerchinsk is marked by the Assumption Monastery, the oldest in Dauria, founded in 1664. Its cathedral, consecrated in 1712, is the easternmost building in the Muscovite Baroque style.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Nerchinsk serves as the administrative center of Nerchinsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Nerchinsk, together with one rural locality (the \"selo\" of Makeyevka), is incorporated within Nerchinsky Municipal District as Nerchinskoye Urban Settlement.\n\nThe Nerchinsk Airport is a former air-base located northwest of the town. It was abandoned in the 1990s. The substandard runway length suggests a 1950s design.\n\n"}

An extraterrestrial, he resembles an anthropomorphic rodent, such as a squirrel or chipmunk.\n\nCh'p first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2 #148 was created by Paul Kupperberg and Don Newton.\n\nCh'p's early history was recounted in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #203. A native of the planet H'lven, he participated in the defense of his homeworld from an invasion by the Crabster army of Doctor Ub'x. He was captured and sentenced to death, but one of the Guardians of the Universe came secretly to induct him into the Corps with the power ring of his predecessor, who had fallen attempting to stop the invasion. Using the ring, Ch'p was able to defeat Doctor Ub'x and free his world. Shortly afterward he travelled to Oa where he was instructed by Kilowog in the same group of recruits as Hal Jordan. Ch'p went on to become the Green Lantern of sector 1014, and became good friends with Jordan, Mogo, Salaak and other members of the Green Lantern Corps. Ch'p maintained a secret identity on H'lven until he married his longtime girlfriend M'nn'e. While not serving the Guardians on Oa, Ch'p defended H'lven from various threats, many of them engineered by his old nemesis Doctor Ub'x.\n\nCh'p's history as a Green Lantern was fairly typical until his participation in the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Since the crisis had affected the entire universe, it was thus also a Crisis on Infinite H'lvens, and when he returned to his home, he discovered that history had been rewritten so that he had died in an accident fifteen years earlier. In the new timeline, his wife M'nn'e had remarried his best friend, D'll. Stunned and disheartened, Ch'p abandoned H'lven for Earth, where he served with the team of Green Lanterns that were assigned to safeguard the planet. Unlike the rest of the universe, the members of the Corps were able to recall pre-Crisis events. They were thus the only people who recalled the Green Lantern from H'lven. During this period, Ch'p once again battled Doctor Ub'x, the only other person from H'lven who recalled the pre-Crisis timeline. The two adversaries eventually realized the important connection they shared and set aside their differences.\n\nCh'p's experiences on Earth were primarily negative, such as his shocked realization that his Earthly counterparts were non-sapient animals, so he eventually returned to H'lven to start over. When the power battery on Oa was destroyed following the execution of Sinestro, Ch'p's ring was one of the few that still functioned. The strain of living on a world where nobody remembered him led to depression and a suicide attempt that was halted by his fellow Green Lantern, Salaak, who became Ch'p's advisor and friend on H'lven. The two friends later travelled to Oa to participate in the reconstruction of the Green Lantern Corps. Ch'p was assigned to patrol Oa, specifically the makeshift city called Mosaic World. There he teams up with John Stewart who is under the subtle influence of Sinestro. A yellow tractor-trailer hits and kills Ch'p. An image of the deceased Ch'p occasionally appears to the Green Lantern John Stewart, although the exact nature of the apparition was never fully explained. When the Corps was refounded following the defeat of Parallax, another native of H'lven, B'dg, was selected as the new Green Lantern of sector 1014.\n\nCh'p has appeared in numerous ways since his death. He is shown in an Alex Ross painting of the Green Lantern Corps; and in one of the last Kyle Rayner Green Lantern stories, where Kyle visits his sector. In an issue of the DC comic \"52\", the character Ambush Bug is shown enjoying a snack food called \"Ch'ps\" that apparently has a certain space squirrel as a mascot. Ch'p also appeared in a flashback story in the current Green Lantern series (#31) training in the same class as Hal Jordan.\n\nCh'p is one of the many fallen Lanterns to be risen from his grave on Oa to become a Black Lantern. He is one of the many Black Lanterns beginning a stand against the living Green Lanterns on Oa.\nThe re-animated Ch'p is destroyed by Guy Gardner wielding Red and Green power rings.\n\n\n\nCh'p is featured in the \"Smallville Season 11\" digital comic based on the TV series.\n"}

The Lubbock Lights incident received national publicity in the United States as a UFO sighting. The Lubbock Lights were investigated by the U.S. Air Force in 1951. The Air Force initially believed the lights were caused by a type of bird called a plover, but eventually concluded that the lights \"weren't birds... but they weren't spaceships...the [Lubbock Lights] have been positively identified as a very commonplace and easily explainable natural phenomenon.\" However, to maintain the anonymity of the scientist who had provided the explanation, the Air Force refrained from providing any details regarding their explanation for the lights.\n\nThe first publicized sighting of the lights occurred on August 25, 1951, at around 9 pm. Three professors from Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University), located in Lubbock, were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's homes when they observed the \"lights\" fly overhead. A total of 20-30 lights, as bright as stars but larger in size, flew over the yard in a matter of seconds. The professors immediately ruled out meteors as a possible cause for the sightings, and as they discussed their sighting a second, similar, group of lights flew overhead.\n\nThe three professors - Dr. A.G. Oberg, chemical engineer, Dr. W.L. Ducker, a department head and petroleum engineer, and Dr. W.I. Robinson, a geologist - reported their sighting to the local newspaper, the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\". Following the newspaper's article, three women in Lubbock reported that they had observed \"peculiar flashing lights\" in the sky on the same night as the professor's sightings. Dr. Carl Hemminger, a professor of German at Texas Tech, also reported seeing the objects, as did the head of the college's journalism department.\n\nThe three professors became determined to view the objects again and perhaps discover their identity. On September 5, 1951, all three men, along with two other professors from Texas Tech, were sitting in Dr. Robinson's frontyard when the lights flew overhead. According to Dr. Grayson Mead the lights \"appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish-blue, slightly fluorescent in color. They were smaller than the full moon at the horizon. There were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights... they were absolutely circular... it gave all of us... an extremely eerie feeling.\" Mead claimed that the lights could not have been birds, but he also stated that they \"went over so fast... that we wished we could have had a better look.\" The professors observed one formation of lights flying above a thin cloud at about ; this allowed them to calculate that the lights were traveling at over .\n\nOn the evening of August 30, 1951, Carl Hart, Jr., a freshman at Texas Tech, was lying in bed looking out of the window of his room when he observed a group of 18-20 white lights in a \"v\" formation flying overhead. Hart took a 35-mm Kodak camera and walked to the backyard of his parents’ home to see if the lights would return. Two more flights passed overhead, and Hart was able to take a total of five photos before they disappeared. After having the photos developed Hart took them to the offices of the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\". After examining the photos the newspaper's editor, Jay Harris, told Hart that he would print them in the paper, but that he would \"run him (Hart) out of town\" if the photos were fake. When Hart assured him that the photos were genuine, Harris paid Hart $10 for the pictures. The photographs were soon reprinted in newspapers around the nation, and were printed in \"Life\" magazine, thus giving them wide publicity. The physics laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio analyzed the Hart photographs. After an extensive analysis and investigation of the photos, Lieutenant Edward J. Ruppelt, the supervisor of the Air Force's Project Blue Book, released a written statement to the press that \"the [Hart] photos were never proven to be a hoax, but neither were they proven to be genuine.\" Hart has consistently maintained to this day that the photos are genuine. Curiously, the Texas Tech professors claimed that the photos did not represent what they had seen, since their objects had flown in a \"u\" formation instead of the \"v\" formation depicted in Hart's photos.\n\nIn late September 1951, Lieutenant Ruppelt read about the Lubbock Lights and decided to investigate them. Project Blue Book, founded in 1948 as Project Sign, was the Air Force's official research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. Ruppelt traveled to Lubbock and interviewed the professors, Carl Hart, and others who claimed to have witnessed the lights. Ruppelt's conclusion at the time was that the professors had seen a type of bird called a plover. The city of Lubbock had installed new vapor street lights in 1951, and Ruppelt believed that the plovers, flying over Lubbock in their annual migration, were reflecting the new street lights at night. Witnesses who supported this assertion were T.E. Snider, a local farmer who on August 31, 1951 had observed some birds flying over a drive-in movie theater; the birds' undersides were reflected in the light. Another witness, Joe Bryant, had been sitting outside his home with his wife on August 25 - the same night on which the three professors had first seen the lights. According to Bryant, he and his wife had seen a group of lights fly overhead, and then two other flights. Like the professors, they were at first baffled by the objects, but when the third group of lights passed overhead they began to circle the Bryants' home. Mr. Bryant and his wife then noticed that the lights were actually plovers, and could hear them as well. In addition, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and one of Project Blue Book's scientific consultants, contacted one of the Texas Tech professors in 1959 and learned that the professor, after careful research, had concluded that he had actually been observing the plovers.\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with this explanation. William Hams, the chief photographer for the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\", took several nighttime photos of birds flying over Lubbock's vapor street lights and found that he could not duplicate Hart's photos - the images were too dim to be developed. Dr. J.C. Cross, the head of Texas Tech's biology department, ruled out the possibility that birds could have caused the sightings. A game warden Ruppelt interviewed felt that the sightings could not have been caused by plovers, due to their slow speed () and tendency to fly in groups much smaller than the number of objects reported by eyewitnesses. The warden did admit that an unusually large number of plovers had been seen in the fall of 1951. Dr. Mead, who had observed the lights, strongly disputed the plover explanation: \"these objects were too large for any bird...I have had enough experience hunting and I don't know of any bird that could go this fast we would not be able to hear...to have gone as fast as this, to be birds, they would have to have been exceedingly low to disappear quite so quickly.\" In his 1956 book \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects\", Ruppelt rejected the plover hypothesis but declined to say what the lights were:\n\n\"They weren't birds, they weren't refracted light, but they weren't spaceships. The lights... have been positively identified as a very commonplace and easily explainable natural phenomenon. It is very unfortunate that I can't divulge... the way the answer was found... Telling the story would lead to [the identity of the scientist who \"finally hit upon the answer\"] and... I promised the man complete anonymity.\"\n\nWhile investigating the Lubbock Lights, Ruppelt also learned that several people in and around Lubbock claimed to have seen a \"flying wing\" moving over the city. Among the witnesses was the wife of Dr. Ducker, who reported that in August 1951 she had observed a \"huge, soundless flying wing\" pass over her house. Ruppelt knew that the US Air Force did possess a \"flying wing\" jet bomber, and he felt that at least some of the sightings had been caused by the bomber, although he could not explain why, according to the witnesses, the wing made no sound as it flew overhead.\n\nThe Lubbock Lights were one of the best-publicized events in American UFO history. In April 1952 \"Life\" magazine published a popular article about the UFO phenomenon; the Lubbock Lights were a prominent feature of the article. Lieutenant (later Captain) Ruppelt devoted an entire chapter of his bestselling 1956 book to the incident. A novel, by Dr. David Wheeler, focuses on the Lubbock Lights.\n\nIn 1994, the Albuquerque-based progressive rock band Skumbaag staged a rock opera called \"The Lubbock Lights- a melodrama and interpretive ballet\".\n\nIn November 1999, Dallas, Texas-based television station KDFW aired a news story about the Lubbock Lights. Reporter Richard Ray interviewed Carl Hart, Jr. about taking the famous photos and being investigated by the U.S. Air Force. The coverage concluded that after decades of intense scrutiny, Hart's photos are still among the most remarkable and vexing in UFO history.\n\nThe Lubbock Lights were featured prominently in the 2002 Sci Fi Channel miniseries \"Taken\", in which one alien poses as a human in the Lubbock area for a brief period of time.\n\nIn 2005, a film called \"Lubbock Lights\" was released about the music scene in Lubbock which describes some theories about the lights by the musicians from the area.\n\nIn 2006, Lubbock-based alternative country band Thrift Store Cowboys wrote and recorded a song entitled \"Lubbock Lights\" on their third album, \"Lay Low While Crawling or Creeping.\"\n\nThe third episode of the 2019 History Channel television series \"Project Blue Book\" is entitled \"The Lubbock Lights\", and is based on the Lubbock Lights incident.\n\n\n\n"}

V. O. Quine, and Jacques Derrida\". It's a contemporary term for a philosophy which reintroduces many concepts from pragmatism. While traditional pragmatism focuses on experience, Rorty centers on language. The self is regarded as a \"centerless web of beliefs and desires\". \n\nIt repudiates the notions of universal truth, epistemological foundationalism, representationalism, and epistemic objectivity. It is a nominalist approach that denies that natural kinds and linguistic entities have substantive ontological implications. Rorty denies that the subject-matter of the human sciences can be studied in the same ways as we study the natural sciences. \n\nIt has been associated with a variety of other thinkers including Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson, though none of these figures have called themselves \"neopragmatists\". The following contemporary philosophers are also often considered to be neopragmatists: Nicholas Rescher (a proponent of methodological pragmatism and pragmatic idealism), Jürgen Habermas, Susan Haack, Robert Brandom, and Cornel West. \n\nNeopragmatists, particularly Rorty and Putnam, draw on the ideas of classical pragmatists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Putnam, in \"Words and Life\" (1994) enumerates the ideas in the classical pragmatist tradition, which newer pragmatists find most compelling. To paraphrase Putnam:\n\nNeopragmatism is distinguished from classical pragmatism (the pragmatism of James, Dewey, Pierce, and Mead) primarily due to the influence of the linguistic turn in philosophy that occurred in the early and mid-twentieth century. The linguistic turn in philosophy reduced talk of mind, ideas, and the world to language and the world. Philosophers stopped talking about the ideas or concepts one may have present in one's mind and started talking about the \"mental language\" and terms used to employ these concepts. In the early twentieth century philosophers of language (e.g. A.J. Ayer, Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore) thought that analyzing language would bring about the arrival of meaning, objectivity, and ultimately, truth concerning external reality. In this tradition, it was thought that truth was obtained when linguistic terms stood in a proper correspondence relation to non-linguistic objects (this can be called \"representationalism\"). The thought was that in order for a statement or proposition to be true it must give facts which correspond to what is actually present in reality. This is called the correspondence theory of truth and is to be distinguished from a neo-pragmatic conception of truth.\n\nThere were many philosophical inquiries during the mid-twentieth century which began to undermine the legitimacy of the methodology of the early Anglo-analytic philosophers of language. W. V. O. Quine in \"Word and Object\", originally published in 1960, attacked the notion of our concepts having any strong correspondence to reality. Quine argued for ontological relativity which attacked the idea that language could ever describe or paint a purely non-subjective picture of reality. More specifically, ontological relativity is the thesis that the things we believe to exist in the world are wholly dependent on our subjective, \"mental languages\". A 'mental language' is simply the way words which denote concepts in our minds are mapped to objects in the world.\n\nQuine's argument for ontological relativity is roughly as follows:\n(see Chapter 2, in \"Word and Object\").\n\nThe above argument is reminiscent of the theme in neopragmatism against the picture theory of language, the idea that the goal of inquiry is to represent reality correctly with one's language.\n\nA second critically influential philosopher to the neo-pragmatist is Thomas Kuhn who argued that our languages for representing reality, or what he called \"paradigms\", are only as good as they produce possible future experiments and observations. Kuhn, being a philosopher of science, argued in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" that \"scientific progress\" was a kind of a misnomer; for Kuhn, we make progress in science whenever we throw off old scientific paradigms with their associated concepts and methods in favor of new paradigms which offer novel experiments to be done and new scientific ontologies. For Kuhn 'electrons' exist just so much as they are useful in providing us with novel experiments which will allow us to uncover more about the new paradigm we have adopted. Kuhn believes that different paradigms posit different things to exist in the world and are therefore incommensurable with each other. Another way of viewing this is that paradigms describe new languages, which allow us to describe the world in new ways. Kuhn was a fallibilist; he believed that all scientific paradigms (e.g. classical Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian relativity) should be assumed to be, on the whole, false but good for a time as they give scientists new ideas to play around with. Kuhn's fallibilism, holism, emphasis on incommensurability, and ideas concerning objective reality are themes which often show up in neopragmatist writings.\n\nWilfrid Sellars argued against foundationalist justification in epistemology and was therefore also highly influential to the neopragmatists, especially Rorty.\n\nPhilosophers such as Derrida and Heidegger and their views on language have been highly influential to neopragmatist thinkers like Richard Rorty. Rorty has also emphasised the value of \"historicist\" or \"genealogical\" methods of philosophy typified by Continental thinkers such as Foucault.\n\nThe \"later\" Ludwig Wittgenstein in the \"Philosophical Investigations\" argues contrary to his earlier views in the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" that the role of language is not to describe reality but rather to perform certain actions in communities. The language-game is the concept Wittgenstein used to emphasize this. Wittgenstein believed roughly that: \n\nMany of the themes found in Wittgenstein are found in neopragmatism. Wittgenstein's emphasis of the importance of \"use\" in language to accomplish communal goals and the problems associated with trying to communicate between two different language games finds much traction in neopragmatist writings.\n\nRichard Rorty was influenced by James, Dewey, Sellars, Quine, Kuhn, Wittgenstein, Derrida, and Heidegger. He found common implications in the writings of many of these philosophers. Namely, he believed that these philosophers were all in one way or another trying to hit on the thesis that our language does not represent things in reality in any relevant way. Rather than situating our language in ways in order to get things right or correct Rorty says in the Introduction to the first volume of his philosophical papers that we should believe that beliefs are only habits with which we use to react and adapt to the world. To Rorty getting things right as they are \"in themselves\" is useless if not downright meaningless.\n\nIn 1995 Rorty wrote:\n\"I linguisticize as many pre-linguistic-turn philosophers as I can, in order to read them as prophets of the utopia in which all metaphysical problems have been dissolved, and religion and science have yielded their place to poetry.\"<br>\n\"Rorty and Pragmatism: The Philosopher Responds to His Critics\", edited by Herman J. Saatkamp (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1995).\n\nThis \"linguistic turn\" strategy aims to avoid what Rorty sees as the essentialisms (\"truth,\" \"reality,\" \"experience\") still extant in classical pragmatism. Rorty writes:\n\n\"Analytic philosophy, thanks to its concentration on language, was able to defend certain crucial pragmatist theses better than James and Dewey themselves. [...] By focusing our attention on the relation between language and the rest of the world rather than between experience and nature, post-positivistic analytic philosophy was able to make a more radical break with the philosophical tradition.\"<br>\n\"Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society 21, no. 1 \"(Winter 1985).\n\nOne way to understand the motivation and themes of the neopragmatist is to understand how neopragmatism (and pragmatism in general) distinguishes itself from both idealism and relativism. Neopragmatism is to be distinguished from idealism primarily in the fact that it does not, like idealism, believe that what is actually in the world is affected in any way by what individuals believe concerning it. Neopragmatism holds to the doctrine of a mind-independent reality while simultaneously maintaining that this world is not knowable in the classical Cartesian sense of the word \"know\". The neopragmatist views mind-independent reality to causally influence people's minds but whatever way that influence may be on the individual mind is up to the individual. Neopragmatism is to be distinguished from epistemic relativism on the force of the idea that in order to be an epistemic relativist one must be concerned about getting one's ideas \"right\" in relation to reality. The neopragmatist thesis views this to be a concern which is of no use and therefore is to be discarded. Neopragmatists hold that it makes no sense to talk about getting reality right due to the fact that this adds no utility to do so. The neopragmatist is concerned with developing beliefs and habits which allow one to adapt to one's environment with success rather than generating pictures used in order to describe reality. Since neopragmatism lacks any concern for generating descriptive pictures of reality the whole question of epistemic relativism is meaningless.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While in Dano-Norwegian service she participated in an action at Tripoli, North Africa. She served the Royal Navy as the fifth rate HMS \"Nyaden\" (or \"Nijaden\") from 1808 until 1812 when she was broken up. During her brief British service she participated in some small attacks in the Barents Sea during the Anglo-Russian War.\n\n\"Najaden\" was the first ship that the great Danish naval architect F.C.H. Hohlenberg designed after he returned home from training abroad. She had several revolutionary innovations and bore more resemblance to 19th century sailing warships than 18th century examples. HMS \"Nymphen\" was the only other member of the class.\n\n\"Najaden\" had a slab-sided hull and the typical Hohlenberg pinkie stern, with a place for two stern chaser guns. Gardiner suggests that the pinkie stern and increased tumblehome towards the stern permitted the vessel to fire over the quarters. Naval warfare in the Baltic made extensive use of oared gunboats, which would fire on becalmed vessels from the quarter, an angle that normally broadside guns could not cover. The pinkie stern was unpopular with the British, who removed it when they refitted her.\n\nCompared to many British frigates of the same period, her main gun deck ports were closer to the water (at when loaded with full supplies), and she had less carrying capacity for supplies. This made sense as Hohlenberg expected that her primary area for operations would be the Baltic. But it would have been difficult for her to be in full action in heavy weather in the open Atlantic.\n\nIn the action of 16 May 1797, \"Najaden\", under Captain John Hoppe, with Captain Steen Andersen Bille in overall command, led a small squadron that also included and a hired xebec in an attack at Tripoli. The battle lasted for about two hours before the Tripolitans retreated. The Danes suffered one man killed and one wounded. As a result of the Danish victory, the Bey of Tripoli signed a peace treaty with Denmark on 25 May.\n\nThe British captured \"Najaden\" at the Battle of Copenhagen on 7 September 1807. Lieutenant John Gore brought her home in October. She was to be renamed \"Hephaestion\" but the Admiralty canceled the name change. After refit she joined the British Navy as HMS \"Nyaden\" (sometimes given as \"Nijaden\").\n\n\"Nyaden\" was commissioned under Captain Frederick Cottrell (or Cotterell) in February 1809 and may have sailed for Greenland on 2 March. Under Cottrell \"Nyaden\" participated in at least one and possibly two actions during the Anglo-Russian War. In June 1809 her boats, under the command of her senior lieutenant, A. Wells, participated in a night raid on Kildin Island that wiped out a Russian garrison. Boats from the \"Nyaden\" also captured some 22 or 23 coastal trading vessels in the Kola River, many upriver from the present city of Murmansk. The landing party took away the fort's guns or threw them into the Kola River.\n\nOn 9 June \"Nyaden\" captured the Russian vessels \"Peter Metropolite\", \"Neptune\", and \"Magnum Brostrum\", for which prize money was paid on 4 July 1811. Then on 15 June \"Nyaden\" captured two Russian vessels, \"Rolla\" and \"Czar Constantine\", for which prize money was paid on 23 February 1810. Unfortunately, it is unclear what connection, if any, these vessels had with the raid on Kildin.\n\n\"Nyaden\" was probably the vessel whose boats in July took possession of Catherine Harbour, in the \"ostrog\" or fortified settlement of Kola. The British also commandeered all the stores belonging to the White Sea Company (est. 1803 at Archangel), consisting of salt, cordage etc., as well as some vessels loaded with corn. \"The Times\" reported that this was the first attack of the English upon the Russian territory, news of the attack on Kildin Island either being subsumed or overlooked. The Russian account of the incident is that a British vessel sent two boats with 35 men under a lieutenant. Kola had been demilitarized during the reign of Paul I, but its citizens quickly formed a militia corps of about 300 men under the command of the merchant Matvey Gerasimov to resist the attack. However the Governor, fearing possible reprisals, forbade any resistance so most of population of the town (about a thousand souls) left Kola with their goods. The British sailors entered the town unopposed, sacked a wine store, looted what they could, arrested the Governor and officials, and singing their anthem, returned to their ship. They also captured all the vessels in the bay.\n\n\"Nyaden\" sailed for the Leeward Islands on 14 January 1810. On the way, on 17 January, she and \"Dannemark\", with in company, captured the brig \"Thomas\". (Prize money was available for payment on 24 November 1812.)\n\nOn 8 and 10 July \"Nyaden\" captured \"Marrimack\" and \"Sally\". (Prize money was paid on 19 November 1816.)\n\nWhile she served in the Leeward Islands she suffered an epidemic of yellow fever that killed 47 of her crew. On 19 April 1811 Cottrell died of \"a rapid consumption\" while \"Nyaden\" was off Barbados. His replacement was Captain Robert Fowler. Later, she came under the command of Captain Farmery Predam Epworth.\n\nIn the spring of 1812 she was carrying dispatches from Lisbon back to Great Britain when a flotilla of five French ships of the line that had escaped from Lorient spotted her. The French ships pursued \"Nyaden\" and shots were exchanged, but although some shots damaged her rigging, she managed to flee and warn a convoy of three East Indiamen, \"Northampton\", \"Monarch\", and . The French, bound for Brest, continued on their route without giving chase.\n\n\"Nyaden\" was broken up in May 1812.\n\nThe British took the lines off \"Najaden\", and they are available at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The Royal Danish Naval Museum holds a set of the 1795/96 plans for the \"Najaden\", signed by Hohlenberg.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n"}

Waccabuc is known by many outside of the town for its Castle Rock.\n\nBefore becoming its own hamlet, Waccabuc was originally a vacation retreat established by the Mead family, who are considered one of the First Families of Westchester. The retreat prided itself for having no \"tramps, bars, or malaria.\" A couple of the hamlet's handful of roads, such as \"Tarry-a-Bit,\" are named after the vacation house they originally served. Waccabuc Country Club's main clubhouse sits at the site of one of the original vacation houses.\n\nOn July 1, 1956, Marilyn Monroe wed Arthur Miller in a Jewish ceremony at a private house in Waccabuc.

Some 30 friends and relatives attended the hastily arranged party.\n\nThe Mead Memorial Chapel and The Homestead are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Waccabuc Historic District was listed on July 28, 2015.\n\nThe total population of Waccabuc is just 445 people. Waccabuc is by far the smallest of Lewisboro's four hamlets and the hamlet's strict zoning laws ensure that Waccabuc maintains a low population density not seen in any of the other hamlets. These factors combine to separate Waccabuc from the other hamlets of Lewisboro and project an image of exclusivity.\n\nThe median household income, as of 2010, is $186,554 and the average household income is $240,258. Waccabuc has a per capita income of $79,819.\n\nThe median home value is $1,243,423, earning Waccabuc a place on Forbes magazine's annual list of \"America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes\" and is listed above more recognizable towns in Westchester such as Scarsdale, Pound Ridge, and Chappaqua.

The Book of Psalms is the third section of the Hebrew Bible, and a book of the Christian Old Testament. In the Greek Septuagint version of the Bible, and in its Latin translation in the Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 22 in a slightly different numbering system. In Latin, it is known by the incipit, \"\"\n\nLike all psalms, Psalm 23 was used in worship by the ancient Hebrews. The writer describes God as his shepherd, in the role of protector and provider. The psalm is read, recited and sung by Jews and Christians. It has been called the best-known of the psalms for its universal theme of trust in God.\n\nFollowing is the Hebrew text of Psalm 23:\n\n\n\nFor Christians the image of God as a shepherd evokes connections not only with David but with Jesus, described as \"Good Shepherd\" in the Gospel of John. The phrase about \"the valley of the shadow of death\" is often taken as an allusion to the eternal life given by Jesus.\n\nOrthodox Christians typically include this Psalm in the prayers of preparation for receiving the Eucharist.\n\nThe Reformation inspired widespread efforts in western Europe to make biblical texts available in vernacular languages. One of the most popular early English versions was the Geneva Bible (1557). The most widely recognized version of the psalm in English today is undoubtedly the one drawn from the King James Bible (1611).\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, this psalm is sung as a responsorial in Masses for the dead.\n\nThe psalm is a popular passage for memorization and is often used in sermons.\n\nAn early metrical version of the psalm in English was made in 1565 by Thomas Sternhold. Other metrical versions to emerge from the Protestant Reformation include those from \"The Bay Psalm Book\" (1640) and a version influenced by Sternholm published in the Scottish Psalter (1650). The latter version is still encountered, with modernized spelling, in many Protestant hymns. Other notable metrical versions include those by George Herbert, Philip Sidney, and Isaac Watts.\n\nA metrical version of the psalm is traditionally sung to the hymn tune \"Crimond\", generally attributed to Jessie Seymour Irvine. This version, with its opening words \"The Lord's My Shepherd\", is probably the best-known amongst English-speaking congregations.\nOther melodies, such as \"Brother James' Air\" or \"Amazing Grace\", are also used. Other tunes sometimes used include \"Belmont\", \"Evan\", \"Martyrdom\", \"Orlington\", and \"Wiltshire.\"\n\nIn the twentieth century, Psalm 23 became particularly associated with funeral liturgies in the English-speaking world, and films with funeral scenes often depict a graveside recitation of the psalm. Official liturgies of English-speaking churches were slow to adopt this practice, though. The Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England has only Psalms 39 and 90 in its order for the burial of the dead, and in the Episcopal Church in the United States, Psalm 23 was not used for funerals until the 1928 revision of the prayer book.\n\nThe theme of God as a shepherd was common in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia. For example, King Hammurabi, in the conclusion to his famous legal code, wrote: \"I am the shepherd who brings well-being and abundant prosperity; my rule is just... so that the strong might not oppress the weak, and that even the orphan and the widow might be treated with justice.\" This imagery and language was well known to the community that created the Psalm, and was easily imported into its worship. \n\nPsalm 23 portrays God as a good shepherd, feeding (verse 1) and leading (verse 3) his flock. The \"rod and staff\" (verse 4) are also the implements of a shepherd. Some commentators see the shepherd imagery pervading the entire psalm. It is known that the shepherd is to know each sheep by name, thus when God is given the analogy of a shepherd, he is not only a protector but also the caretaker. God, as the caretaker, leads the sheep to green pastures (verse 2) and still waters (verse 2) because he knows that each of his sheep must be personally led to be fed. Thus, without its Shepherd, the sheep would die either by a predator or of starvation, since sheep are known for their helplessness without their shepherd.\n\nJ. Douglas MacMillan argues that verse 5 (\"Thou preparest a table before me\") refers to the \"old oriental shepherding practice\" of using little raised tables to feed sheep. Similarly, \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" may refer to an ancient form of backliner – the oil is poured on wounds, and repels flies. MacMillan also notes that verse 6 (\"Goodness and mercy shall follow me\") reminds him of two loyal sheepdogs coming behind the flock.\n\nJohn Ellinwood argues that in verses 4 and 5 King David acknowledges God's protection in expeditions and in battles. \"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies\" refers to the sober raucous dinner before major battles. These were raucous in order to demoralize hostiles camped within earshot, and (only) the king ate from a table. \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" because tomorrow this ceremony might be impossible. After each victory there was no longer a need for sobriety, so \"my cup runneth over.\" The king's lyricist wisely shortened these military verses for balance. Also in Psalm 18 David mentions God's protection in battle.\n\nThe first verse of the Psalm ascribes authorship to King David, said in the Hebrew Scriptures to have been a field shepherd himself as a youth. However, some scholars do not believe that David could have written any of the Psalms.\n\nTaken together, Psalm 22, 23 and 24, is seen by some as shepherd psalms, where the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep as suffering servant and king.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847686", "title": "Little Crow", "text": "Little Crow\n\nLittle Crow V (Dakota: \"Thaóyate Dúta\"; ca. 1810 – July 3, 1863) was a chief of a band of the Mdewakanton Dakota people, who were based along the Minnesota River. His given name translates as \"His Red Nation,\" (Thaóyate Dúta). He was known as Little Crow because of a mistranslation by Europeans of his grandfather's name, \"Čhetáŋ Wakhúwa Máni\" (literally, \"Hawk that chases/hunts walking\").\n\nLittle Crow is notable for his role in negotiating the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota of 1851, in which he agreed to remove his band of Dakota to a reservation near the Minnesota River in exchange for annuity goods and payments. In the summer of 1862, the federal government failed to deliver annuities in a timely way, and there were rumors that the 'Great Council' Congress had expended all their gold fighting the great Civil War and could not send any money to the indians, which left the Dakota starving. Little Crow supported the decision of a Dakota war council in August 1862 to try to drive the whites out of the region. Little Crow led warriors in the Dakota War of 1862, but retreated in September 1862 before the war's conclusion in December of that year.\n\nLittle Crow was shot and killed on July 3, 1863 by two white settlers, a man and his son. He was scalped and his body was taken to Hutchinson, Minnesota, where it was ritually humiliated and mutilated by white settlers. Some time later his remains were exhumed by Army troops, and eventually the Minnesota Historical Society held and displayed them publicly. In 1971 the Society repatriated his remains, giving them to his grandson. He had Little Crow reinterred at the First Presbyterian Church and Cemetery in Flandreau, South Dakota. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\n\nLittle Crow was born at the Dakota settlement of Kaposia just below present-day Indian Mounds Park. His father died in 1846 after accidentally discharging a gun. Band leadership was disputed between Little Crow and his brother. They had an armed fight that resulted in Little Crow being wounded in both wrists. This left scars that he concealed with long sleeves for the rest of his life. He had a third physical oddity, a double row of teeth. By 1849, Little Crow took control of his band.\n\nIn 1851, the United States negotiated the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and the Treaty of Mendota with the Dakota people. Little Crow was present at Traverse des Sioux and signed the Mendota treaty, by which the bands agreed to move to land set aside along the Minnesota River to the west of their traditional territory. The treaty as ratified by the United States Senate removed Article 3 of the treaty, which had set aside this land. The tribe was compelled to negotiate a new treaty, under threat of forcible removal to the Dakota Territory, and was granted land only on one side of the river.\n\nLittle Crow tried to adapt to customs of the United States. He visited President James Buchanan in Washington, D.C., replaced his native clothing with trousers and jackets with brass buttons, joined the Episcopal Church, and took up farming. However, by 1862, his band was starving. Crops had failed on their small reservation, game was overhunted, and Congress failed to pay the annuities mandated by treaty. Payments were delayed because of the outbreak of the American Civil War. As the tribe grew hungry and as food languished in traders' warehouses at the Sioux agencies, Little Crow's ability to restrain his people deteriorated.\n\nOn August 4, 1862, about five hundred Dakota broke into food warehouses at the Lower Agency. The agent in charge, Thomas J. Galbraith, ordered defending troops not to shoot and called for a council. At the conference, Little Crow pointed out that the Dakota were owed the money to buy the food and warned that \"When men are hungry, they help themselves.\" The representative of the traders, Andrew Myrick, replied, \"So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass.\"\n\nWithin weeks, on August 17, 1862, a band of Dakota crossed paths with a group of white civilian settlers. The Dakota killed five of the settlers, mutilating their bodies in ritual fashion.\n\nThe band's need for food and failures by the federal government and trades resulted in the Dakota War of 1862. Little Crow agreed to lead the bands through the conflict, even though he knew the whites could ultimately send larger numbers of troops into the conflict than his people could counter. The Dakota first attacked the Lower Sioux agency; they scalped Myrick and stuffed his mouth with grass in a sense of revenge.\n\nUnder Taoyateduta's leadership, the Dakota had some success in the ambush of a small detachment of US troops under Captain Marsh at Redwood ferry, an attack on a burial party in the Battle of Birch Coulee, and killing many unprepared settlers. However, two Dakota attacks on Fort Ridgely were thwarted by soldiers and civilians who, although outnumbered, used the fort's cannon to drive off the attackers. Little Crow was wounded by cannon fire in the second attack on Fort Ridgely, and did not join the attack on New Ulm. The Dakota attacked New Ulm twice, and a collection of settlers and volunteers staved off the warriors although they were outnumbered. Attacks on Forest City, Hutchinson, and Fort Abercrombie were also repulsed. The Dakota attacked white civilians throughout the area. In the end, Little Crow's forces suffered a rout at the Battle of Wood Lake on September 23, 1862, after which Little Crow and many of his warriors fled west, taking three white boys with them as captives. One of the boys, George Washington Ingalls age 9 (cousin to author Laura Ingalls) had witnessed the killing and scalping of his father Jedidiah and the capture of his three sisters at the start of the conflict. By late spring 1863, Little Crow and his followers were camped near the Canada–US border. They ransomed the boys in early June 1863, in exchange for blankets and horses.\n\nDeciding that the tribe must adopt a mobile existence, having been robbed of its territory, Little Crow led a raiding party to steal horses from his former land in Minnesota. His people did not want to do this. On the evening of July 3, 1863, while he and his son \"Wowinapa\" were picking raspberries, they were spotted by Nathan Lamson and his son Chauncey. The four engaged in a brief firefight. Little Crow wounded the elder Lamson, but was mortally shot by both Lamson and his son. The chief told his own son to flee.\n\nThe Lamsons separated, and each traveled the nearly 12 miles to Hutchinson, Minnesota to raise the alarm. The next day, a search party returned and found the body of an unidentified Dakota man. The body wore a coat they recognized as belonging to white settler James McGannon, who had been killed two days before. They scalped the Dakota man, and later brought the body back to Hutchinson. They then dragged his body along the town's Main Street. Firecrackers were placed in his ears and nose and lit. The body was ultimately tossed into a pit at a slaughterhouse. It was later decapitated.\nOn July 28, 1863, Wowinapa was captured by US Army troops in the vicinity of Devil's Lake, Dakota Territory. He told the troops of Little Crow's death. Officials tracked down and exhumed the chief's body on August 16. Little Crow's identity was verified by his scarred wrists. The next year, the Legislature awarded Nathan Lamson $500 for \"rendering great service to the State\". His son Chauncey Lamson received a $75 bounty for the scalp, although he had taken it the same day that the Adjutant General's bounty on Dakota warriors was declared on July 4, 1863.\n\nThe Minnesota Historical Society acquired Little Crow's scalp in 1868, and his skull in 1896. Other bones were collected at other times. These human trophies were displayed publicly for decades. In 1971, the Society returned Little Crow's remains to his grandson Jesse Wakeman (son of Wowinapa) for burial. A small stone memorial tablet was installed at the roadside of the field where Little Crow was killed.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1626 Charles had dissolved Parliament in order to prevent it impeaching his favourite, the influential Duke of Buckingham. Being in need of money to prosecute war with Spain as part of his strategy for intervention in the Thirty Years War, he resorted to means of dubious legality to raise the necessary funds, imprisoning without charge those who refused to pay. This had resulted in Parliament presenting the King with the Petition of Right in 1628, in response to which Charles had again dismissed Parliament and for the next eleven years attempting to govern without it.\n\nIn 1640, the situation had become desperate enough for Charles to summon Parliament again: faced with the Bishops' War in Scotland, he attempted to raise money for a new royal army and immediately dismissed the Parliament in May when it refused to accede. He attempted to send an army anyway, but starved of funds, the ill-equipped and poorly led English army was easily crushed by Scottish supporters of the National Covenant. Now in need of money to pay indemnities to the Scots, Charles was advised by a hastily summoned Magnum Concilium that he had no choice but to return to Parliament, which reassembled in November.\n\nFirst proposed by John Pym, the effective leader of opposition to the King in Parliament and taken up by George Digby, John Hampden and others, the Grand Remonstrance summarised all of Parliament's opposition to Charles' foreign, financial, legal and religious policies, setting forth 204 separate points of objection and calling for the expulsion of all bishops from Parliament, a purge of officials, with Parliament having a right of veto over Crown appointments and an end to sale of land confiscated from Irish rebels. The document was careful not to make any direct accusation against the King himself, or any other named individual, instead blaming the state of affairs on a Roman Catholic conspiracy, made the easier by his reconciliation with Spain and marriage to Henrietta Maria, a French Catholic. It was strongly anti-Catholic in tone, taking the side of the Puritan party in the English church in opposition to William Laud, whom Charles had appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and who, by implication, was therefore placed at the heart of the Catholic plot.\n\nOn 22 November 1641, following a protracted debate, the Grand Remonstrance was passed by a relatively narrow margin: 159 votes to 148. Its passage divided Parliament and drove some prominent parliamentarians such as Hyde and Falkland, who had previously been critical of the King, into the Royalist camp. At the same time, it strengthened the resolve of those who opposed what they saw as a drift toward Catholicism and Absolutism: Cromwell commented to Falkland that if the Grand Remonstrance had been defeated, 'I would have sold all I had the next morning and never seen England more; and I know there are many other honest men of the same resolution'.\n\nIn regard to church government, the Grand Remonstrance called for \nA General Synod of the most grave, pious, learned and judicious divines of this island, assisted with some from foreign parts professing the same religion with us, who may consider all things necessary for the peace and good government of the Church. The result was the establishment of the Westminster Assembly of Divines.\n\nThe Grand Remonstrance was delivered to King Charles I on 1 December 1641, but he long delayed giving any response to it. Parliament therefore proceeded to have the document published and publicly circulated, forcing the King's hand. On 23 December, he gave his reply, refusing to remove the bishops. Charles insisted that none of his ministers were guilty of any crime so as to merit their removal and deferred any decision on Irish land until the conclusion of the war there. The king stated that he could not reconcile Parliament's view of the state of England with his own and that regarding religious affairs, in addition to affirming his opposition to Roman Catholicism, it was also necessary to protect the Church from 'many schismatics and separatists'.\n\nThe response, drafted in consultation with Hyde, was an attempt at moderation calculated to win back the support of more moderate members of Parliament. In spite of this and concessions including the arrest of William Laud, subsequent events made reconciliation impossible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847690", "title": "Timestream", "text": "Timestream\n\nThe timestream or time stream is a metaphorical conception of time as a stream, a flowing body of water. In \"Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction\", the term is more narrowly defined as: \"the series of all events from past to future, especially when conceived of as one of many such series\". Timestream is the normal passage or flow of time and its historical developments, within a given dimension of reality. The concept of the time stream, and the ability to travel within and around it, are the fundamentals of a genre of science fiction.\n\nThis conception has been widely used in mythology and in fiction.\n\nThis analogy is useful in several ways:\n\n\nScience fiction scholar Andrew Sawyer writes, \"The paradoxes of time—do \"we\" move in time, or does \"it\" move by us? Does it exist or is it merely an illusion of our limited perception?—are puzzles that exercise both physicists and philosophers...\"\n\nBrian Stableford writes of the historical and philosophical concepts of time (and using the terminology of \"flow\"): \n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus was famous for a statement that has been translated in many ways, most commonly as \"No man ever steps in the same river twice,\" which is often called his \"flux [flow] doctrine.\" An essayist for the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" explained it in this manner: \"Everything is in flux (in the sense that 'everything is always flowing in \"some\" respects'...) ...\"\n\nIn fiction, an alternate continuity is sometimes called an alternate timestream.\n\n\"The Time Stream\", a 1946 science fiction novel by author John Taine (pseudonym of Eric Temple Bell), is the first novel to see time as a flowing stream. It was originally serialized in \"Wonder Stories\", in four parts, from December, 1931, to March, 1932. Science fiction scholar E. F. Bleiler described how Taine employed the metaphor:\n\nThe basic concept is that time is a circular stream that runs eternally, with far past blending into far future. It is possible for certain individuals to enter this stream mentally and move in either direction, although this is a dangerous venture, for they may be carried away erratically by the stream. ... In San Francisco nine associates, who have been troubled by occasional memories of [the planet] Eos, band together to explore the time stream. They live out crisis moments in both times.\n\nAnother mid-century novel which employed the term in its title was \"The Ship That Sailed the Time Stream\" (1965) by G. C. Edmondson (pseudonym of José Mario Garry Ordoñez Edmondson y Cotton). John Clute writes that this \"and its sequel, \"To Sail the Century Sea\" (1981), are amusingly and graphically told Fantastic-Voyage tales involving a US ship and its inadvertent Time Travels. They remain his most successful books.\"\n\nOther fiction titles with the term include J. Robert King's 1999 novel \"Time Streams\" (), Michael Moorcock's 1993 collection \"A Nomad of the Time Streams\" (), and Charles M. Saplak's short story \"Backwater by the Time Stream\" (\"Manifest Destiny\" #1, Winter 1993).\n\nDiscussing the theme of parallel universes, in an encyclopedia article which can usefully be applied to the concept of timestreams, Brian Stableford and David Langford write, \"A parallel world is another universe situated 'alongside' our own, displaced from it along a spatial fourth Dimension (parallel worlds are often referred to in sf as 'other dimensions'). Although whole universes may lie parallel in this sense, most stories focus on parallel Earths. The parallel-world idea forms a useful framework for the notion of Alternate History, and is often used in this way... The idea that other worlds lie parallel to our own and occasionally connect with it is one of the oldest speculative ideas in literature and legend; examples range from Fairyland to the 'astral plane' of Spiritualists and mystics. There are two basic folkloristic themes connected with the notion; in one, an ordinary human is translocated into a fantasy land where s/he undergoes adventures and may find the love and fulfilment that remain beyond reach on Earth; in the other, a communication or visitation from the other world affects the life of an individual within this world, often injuring or destroying that person. Both patterns are very evident in modern imaginative fiction, shaping whole subgenres... A common variant of the theme is that of a multiplicity of almost-identical worlds existing in parallel: alternate worlds in which there has been no significant change.\"\n\nRick Sutcliffe provides a definition in a brief essay on his own fiction: \"The timestream is an alternate history device used in Rick Sutcliffe's fiction. It is the medium in which the various alternate earths exist, or, if one prefers, it provides the connections among them, in the manner of C. S. Lewis' wood between the worlds -- a place between.\"\n\nWhile not discussing the timestream \"per se\", scholar John Grant discusses a related topic, that of the time slip: \"Generally protagonists [return] to their starting points but a frequent device is that, after repeated timeslips, the 'traveler' chooses to remain in the other period. Generally there is an emotional or psychological connection of some kind between the character and the earlier time — most often love... Unsurprisingly, timeslips are a staple of the subgenre of romance fiction called the Paranormal Romance, exemplified by Diana Gabaldson's \"Outlander\" (1991) and its sequels.\"\n\nExamples of the usage of timestream:\n\n"}

Iván Jared Moreno, \"La Quesadillera\", would eventually leave, to be replaced by Randy Ebright (who joined the band in October 1995), the only US-born member of the band. Around February 1996 de la Cueva would also leave, being replaced by Paco Ayala, establishing the four-member line-up that has remained consistent over the years.\n\nThroughout 1996, the band played in many underground locations in Mexico City and began to have a small group of fans. Their success finally came when they opened for Héroes del Silencio in Monterrey and later for La Lupita in Puebla. During a concert in which they opened for Illya Kuryaki and The Valderramas, talent hunters from Universal offered them to record an album. It was a difficult period, and the band had to sell cassettes during the concerts while they prepared their album.\n\nIn July 1997, they released their debut album \"¿Dónde Jugarán las Niñas?\", which took its name partly from Maná's album \"¿Dónde Jugarán los Niños?\" generating controversy with stores refusing to sell it because of its lyrics and cover. Molotov went out to the street to sell their discs as a form of protest. The lyrics include a mixture of politics, sex and expletives, which made it hard for Molotov to enter mainstream media. In 1998, they participated with the song \"Payaso\" in the album \"\" a tribute to legendary singer José José.\n\nMolotov received a recognition without precedent for a hip-hop group in Spanish. Urban publications such as \"Vibe\" said about them: \"[Molotov's music] is incendiary by nature… with darts poisoned aimed directly to the heart of the oppressive paternalism of the government.\" For example, the song \"Gimme Tha Power\" contained lyrics such as \"Hay que arrancar el problema de raíz y cambiar el gobierno de nuestro país\" (translated: We have to rip out the problem by the roots and change the government of our country). These lyrics reflected aspects of the tumultuous political climate of the late 1990s. In 2000, popular vote elected a president from a different political party than that which had held the presidency, uninterrupted, since 1940 (see Politics of Mexico).\n\nIn 1998 Molotov released \"Molomix,\" an album with remixes of \"Donde Jugarán...?,\" including a version of the classic Queen song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" titled \"Rap, Soda y Bohemia\", and a new song, \"El Carnal de las estrellas\", which attacks the Mexican television network Televisa, as a response to its refusal to air the band's videos.\n\nIn September 1999, \"Apocalypshit\" was released and the band toured Europe, including Russia and were also a part of the 1999 Vans Warped Tour. In 2001, after a couple of years of touring, they took a rest by contributing to the soundtrack of the films \"Y tu mamá también\" (in which the soundtrack was nominated for a Grammy) and \"Atlético San Pancho,\".\n\nThey were part of the Watcha Tour 2000, which included 17 shows with Los Enanitos Verdes, Aterciopelados, Café Tacuba, and A.N.I.M.A.L.\n\nIn 2003, the band's new album, \"Dance and Dense Denso,\" was released with the Grammy-winning single, \"Frijolero,\" which became the band's biggest hit to date.\n\nIn 2004, the band released \"Con Todo Respeto,\" which consisted of covers of groups such as The Misfits, Beastie Boys, ZZ Top, and Los Toreros Muertos.\n\nOn January 18, 2007, Molotov's official website addressed a separation rumor, saying that it could neither be confirmed or denied but that more information would be coming soon. A few weeks later, the band confirmed on its website that it would indeed be touring and posted dates starting April 3 in Ventura, California, and ending April 15 in Dallas, Texas. Despite no official break-up update, many radio stations announced the tour as Molotov's last.\n\nIn 2007, the band released its album \"Eternamiente\" (a portmanteau of \"eternamente\" [eternally] and \"miente\" [he lies]) with the hit song \"Yofo.\" which opened with first week sales of nearly 1,000 copies.\n\nIn 2008, the song \"Apocalypshit\", from the album of the same name, was used in the first episode of \"Breaking Bad\", during camper scene.\n\nMolotov performed at the 2009 Coachella Music Festival.\n\nIn an interview, the band talked about the possibility of releasing a live DVD. In a later interview, Randy Ebright said the DVD would possibly be directed by Alfonso Cuaron, with whom they worked on the soundtrack for Cuaron's film \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\". The band's manager, Jorge Mondragón, has said that a book would be published recounting their 15 years as a band.\n\nBand lead guitar Tito Fuentes said that their next album would be released independently during 2010.\n\nOn May 14, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform on Mexico City's Zócalo for the first time in the band's history, after being denied the venue five times before. The band performed in a concert along with other bands such as Jaguares and Maldita Vecindad to protest against Arizona's SB 1070 law.\n\nThe band recorded their performance in the \"Creation of Peace\" festival in Kazan, Russia. In May 2012 this was released as the live album \"Desde Rusia con amor\", with an accompanying DVD.\n\nThey worked with Mexican film director Olallo Rubio, providing their music to a documentary called \"Gimme the Power\" in which Rubio analyzes Mexico under the power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional). The documentary was released on June 1, 2012.\n\n\"Note: The members switch instruments depending on what song they are performing; the below list shows their main roles in the band.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Band awards\":\n\n\"Dance and Dense Denso\":\n\n\"Con Todo Respeto\":\n\n\"Eternamiente\":\n\n\"Desde Rusia Con Amor\":\n\n\"Agua Maldita\"\n"}

The organization's primary goal is to promote and represent the interests of its agricultural members within the state of Michigan.\n\nThere are two types of member classification within the Michigan Farm Bureau. Members are either associate members or regular members. Associate members are those who have obtained membership because they are sympathetic to the cause of the Michigan Farm Bureau, or because they would like to receive the benefits associated with a membership (such as Farm Bureau Insurance). Regular members are those who are involved with agriculture. Regular members are typically active farmers, but they can also be retired farmers, greenhouse operators, or landholders who lease their land for agricultural activities.\n\nThe Michigan Farm Bureau provides a variety of benefits and services to its members, but the most important functions for regular members are (state and federal) lobbying activities and programs and services to educate members on current agricultural issues: political, environmental or otherwise.\n\nOther services, such as long distance telephone service, health insurance and many others, are available to both regular and associate members.\n\nThe headquarters of the Michigan Farm Bureau Family of Companies is located in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nThe current president of Michigan Farm Bureau is Carl Bednarski.\n\nThe Michigan Farm Bureau calls itself a grassroots organization, with its agricultural members meeting once per year to create and vote on policy, which guides the direction of the organization for the next year.\n\nEach member of the Michigan Farm Bureau belongs to an independently operated county Farm Bureau. There are 67 county Farm Bureaus within the state – some county Farm Bureau offices cover more than one county with lower population levels.\n\nEach County Farm Bureau has an annual meeting when policy for that county Farm Bureau is set. During that meeting, policy is also developed for the state and national levels. State and national policies passed by majority vote at the county annual meetings are then reviewed and modified by county Farm Bureau delegates at the state annual meeting. National policies passed by majority vote at the state annual meeting are then reviewed and modified by delegates at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual meeting.\n\nThe Michigan Farm Bureau is a member organization of both the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, both headed by Bob Stallman. The USFRA is a lobbying organization \"of more than 80 farmer and rancher-led organizations and agricultural partners representing virtually all aspects of agriculture, working to engage in dialogue with consumers who have questions about how today’s food is grown and raised,\" and is funded by checkoff funds from the USDA and corporate sponsors including Monsanto and DuPont.\n\nThe Michigan Farm Bureau was formed as an initial response to the tax situation in the early 1900s. The motor car was changing the dynamics of transportation, and Michigan's residents demanded new and improved roads for their vehicles. The state legislature determined that the best way to fund road improvements was through a tax levied on owners of land touching roadways. Because Michigan's farmers owned more land than most citizens, the tax became a burden on their lifestyle.\n\nAfter its formation, the Michigan Farm Bureau successfully lobbied for shifting this tax from land owners to purchasers of gasoline.\n\nIn early 1973, the flame retardant PBB was accidentally mixed with a cattle feed supplement and then sent to a Michigan Farm Bureau Services feed mill in Battle Creek, Michigan. By the time the mix-up was discovered a year later, contaminated livestock feed had been sent to hundreds of farms. About 500 contaminated farms were quarantined. The state of Michigan killed thousands of animals and destroyed tons of animal feed and dairy products to keep the chemical out of the food system. The Gratiot Landfill in Gratiot County, Michigan, has 269,000 pounds of PBB buried, in addition to animals.\n\nBut people across the state of Michigan were already contaminated, mostly at low levels. Residents of quarantined farms had the highest levels of the chemical and formed the base of 4,000 participants for the Michigan Long-Term PBB Study, now transferred to Georgia due to lack of funds. The study is the largest one on human chemical contamination in the world.\n\nMichigan Farm Bureau came under criticism in 2014 for its stance on changes to regulations related to the Michigan Right to Farm Act, with small farm rights advocates asserting that MFB is supporting regulations that harm small farms and favor agribusiness.\n\n\n"}

Fighting broke out in 1563 when Suganuma Sada, a Matsudaira retainer entered the Jōgū-ji temple in Okazaki, and confiscated its rice to feed his own men. In retaliation the monks attacked Suganuma's castle and retrieved the rice back to Jōgū-ji where they barricaded themselves.

In October 2013 he joined the Government as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department of Communities and Local Government. In May 2015 Williams lost his Bristol West seat to the Labour Party's Thangam Debbonaire, and in May 2017 he came third in the election for the newly created role of Mayor of the West of England.\n\nWilliams grew up in the village of Abercynon in the Cynon Valley in Glamorgan, Wales. He attended Mountain Ash Comprehensive School and the University of Bristol, graduating in 1988 with a degree in History. During his first two years he lived in Wills Hall, one of the University's halls of residence, and remains a member of the Wills Hall Association. He qualified as Chartered Tax Adviser and worked for several large firms including PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Grant Thornton.\n\nWilliams was interested in politics from a young age. While at the University of Bristol he was President of the SDP/Liberal society, and an active member of the local SDP branch. He has also served on Avon County Council (1993-1996) and Bristol City Council (1995-1999), elected as Councillor for the Liberal Democrats' then-stronghold of Cabot ward in 1993 aged 26. He was leader of the Avon Liberal Democrat group from 1995 to 1997. Williams had been the Liberal Democrat candidate for the safe Labour seat of Bristol South in 1997, before being selected to stand for Bristol West at the 2001 general election. Williams won Bristol West in 2005, making him the first Liberal MP ever for that constituency and the first to be elected in the city of Bristol since 1935. He was also the first openly gay Liberal Democrat MP.\n\nIn October 2013, Williams was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary at Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). As Minister for Communities, his responsibilities include community cohesion, race relations, localism and community rights, housing standards, building regulations and neighborhood planning. As the Liberal Democrat minister in DCLG he had oversight of all areas of department policy such as housing, local economic development and planning.\n\nIn March 2014, Williams published the Government's proposals following the housing standards review, which recommended a rationalisation of government, local authority and industry housing standards into a national set. As a result, for the first time there will be a national space standard for the interior of housing.\n\nAs Minister for Communities, Williams also announced new funding for promotion of the Cornish language and gave recognition to the people of Cornwall as a national minority on the same basis as the other Celtic people of the British Isles.\n\nIn 2017, it emerged that Williams had responded to 2014 concerns from the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group about the fire safety of Britain's tower blocks, especially the absence of sprinklers in many of these, by saying, \"I have neither seen nor heard anything that would suggest that consideration of these specific potential changes is urgent and I am not willing to disrupt the work of this department by asking that these matters are brought forward.\" The correspondence was leaked to the BBC after the Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nWilliams served as Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health between July 2010 and October 2013. During this time the group published reports on the plain packaging of cigarettes, smoking in cars and the illicit trade in tobacco.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013 he served as the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman in Parliament and to the media. In addition, he has previously served as a member of the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee and has spoken in favour of replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate.\n\nAfter his election on 5 May 2005, Charles Kennedy appointed Williams as Liberal Democrat public health spokesperson, shadowing Minister for Public Health Caroline Flint. In this role he served on the standing committee which scrutinised the Health Bill. One aspect of this Bill was the introduction of a ban on smoking in public places. Williams strongly supported a ban on smoking in all public places, rather than the alternative proposal to exempt private clubs and pubs which do not serve food from the ban. He won an award from World Health Organization for his advocacy of a full ban.\n\nIn the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership election Williams was the agent of Chris Huhne. Following the election, newly elected leader Sir Menzies Campbell moved Williams to the Further and Higher Education portfolio, shadowing Labour Minister Bill Rammell. After the reorganisation of government departments by new Prime Minister Gordon Brown in July 2007 Lib Dem Leader Sir Menzies Campbell reshuffled his team and Williams became Lib Dem spokesperson on Schools.\n\nSince his election, Williams has served on two House of Commons select committees — the Education and Skills Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. He stepped down as a member of the Public Accounts Committee at the beginning of 2006 following his appointment as Further and Higher Education spokesperson in order to focus more exclusively on his portfolio. He transferred to the new Children, Schools and Families Select Committee in November 2007.\n\nFollowing the election of Nick Clegg as leader, whom Williams supported against Chris Huhne, Williams became the spokesperson for Innovation, Universities and Skills.\n\nIn 2008, Williams wrote an alternative policy proposal that would allow top-up fees as part of his role as spokesperson for universities, but the proposal was rejected by the party's Federal Policy Committee. In December 2010, Williams was one of the Liberal Democrat MPs who abstained on the coalition government's proposals to increase tuition fees.\n\nOn 29 November 2005, Williams introduced a Ten Minute Rule bill to the House of Commons to reduce the voting age to 16. The motion was supported by a majority of Labour members and Liberal Democrats, but opposed by the Conservatives. It was defeated by 136-128 votes.\n\nIn January 2013 Williams introduced a backbench committee motion to reduce the voting age. The motion was passed.\n\nIn June 2006, Williams launched a campaign against homophobic bullying, after organising the Education and Skills Select Committee's first ever enquiry into the issue of bullying in schools. His petition read:\n\n\"We, the undersigned, call for the following to support and protect the victims of homophobic bullying:\"\n\n\nIn February 2013 Williams spoke in the second reading debate on the introduction of same sex marriage. He then served as the Lib Dem representative on the public bill committee, introducing amendments to allow opposite sex couples to have civil partnerships and for recognition to be given to humanist marriages.\n\nWilliams was first elected to Avon County Council in May 1993, representing Cabot ward. Avon was abolished in March 1996. In May 1995, Williams had been elected to the City (i.e. district council) ward of Cabot and he continued in office when the unitary authority was created. He stood down from the council in May 1999.\n\nWilliams has contested six general elections - 1997, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017.

III, Section 2, Clause 1) as embodying two distinct limitations on exercise of judicial review.\n\nFirst, the Court has held that the clause identifies the scope of matters which a federal court can and cannot consider as a case (i.e., it distinguishes between lawsuits within and beyond the institutional competence of the federal judiciary), and limits federal judicial power only to such lawsuits as the court is competent to hear.\n\nFor example, the Court has determined that this clause prohibits the issuance of advisory opinions (in which no actual issue exists but an opinion is sought), and claims where the appellant stands to gain only in a generalized sense (i.e. no more or less than people at large), and allows only the adjudication of claims where (1) the plaintiff has actually and personally suffered injury or harm \"in fact\", (2) the injury or harm suffered by the plaintiff is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions and (3) the injury or harm would be capable of redress by the court.\n\nAs with all parts of the law, there are exceptions. One of the most significant deals with free speech and free expression cases involving the First Amendment where a party suing over a restriction on freedom of speech issues can argue the unconstitutionality of a statute restricting certain types of speech or expression, even where the restriction might not directly affect them, such as a bookseller or video game dealer may argue that a restriction on some media restricts their customer's ability to choose various works and the restrictions could have a \"chilling effect\" on some publishers who might not release some works that would be affected by the law. Other than this, generally, there are usually no exceptions to the standing issue at the Federal level.\n\nSecondly, the Court has interpreted the clause as limiting Congress' ability to confer jurisdiction on federal courts. It does so by establishing an outer limit of the types of matters within which Congress may constitutionally confer jurisdiction. Historically, the Court has not interpreted this Clause to limit Congressional power to \"restrict\" the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n\nThe delicate phrasing of the Clause and the ambiguity of the terms therein has inspired frequent academic debate. Though the Supreme Court has given much attention to the legal issues arising from this provision of the Constitution, many problematic issues remain unresolved. Critics argue that the standing requirements imposed by this Clause enable judges to avoid difficult issues, decide the merits of a case before the parties have had a fair opportunity to litigate, and avoid the necessity of applying law the judge finds distasteful.\n\nArticle III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution states:\n\nThis clause, in addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, prohibits courts from issuing advisory opinions, or from hearing cases that are either unripe, meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or moot, meaning that the controversy has already been resolved.\n\nThe earliest expression by the United States Supreme Court of adherence to this requirement came during the presidency of George Washington. Washington sent a letter to the Court asking for their approval should he choose to seek advice from them from time to time on matters that might not come before the Court in a timely manner. Chief Justice John Jay wrote in his response that, although the members of the Court had great confidence in the ability of the president to receive appropriate advice from his executive officers, the Court itself was constitutionally bound not to go beyond its role as an arbiter of judicial questions.\n\nThe most famous case setting forth the parameters of this requirement is \"Muskrat v. United States\", 219 U.S. 346 (1911), in which the Court held that when Congress paid the legal bills for both the plaintiffs and the defendant (in this case the U.S. Treasury department, by designation), then there was no real controversy between the parties, and a judgment of the Court would be the equivalent of an advisory opinion.\n\nThe boundaries of the \"case and controversy\" clause are open to dispute. For instance, the Court has held that where the controversy between parties has ceased because of a change in facts, it has no jurisdiction. However, where the case or controversy ceases--or, in legal terms, is \"mooted\"--after a case is filed, the Court may render a decision in the interest of justice. In \"Roe v. Wade\", for instance, the Court applied the mootness exception for cases \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that due to the natural limitation of the human gestation period, issues concerning pregnancy will always come to term before the appellate process is complete. \"Roe v. Wade\" 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Therefore, the Supreme Court could rule on the constitutionality of an abortion law despite the issue being moot at the time of adjudication.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court observed in \"DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno\" (2006): \"No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.” The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III of the constitution requires plaintiffs to establish their standing to sue. Article III standing law is built on separation-of-powers principles. Its purpose is to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the legislative and executive branch of the U.S. federal government. Article III standing requires an injury that is “concrete, particularized and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling.”\n\nGenerally, the clause is taken to mean that a generalized, as opposed to particular, injury, is not grounds for a federal lawsuit. Relevant cases:\n\nThe clause does not forbid individual States from granting standing to such parties; it only mandates that federal courts may not do so:\n"}

{"id": "1847783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847783", "title": "Kerbdog", "text": "Kerbdog\n\nKerbdog are an alternative metal band from Kilkenny, Ireland who formed in 1991. Following two major-label albums released on Mercury Records, the band split up in 1998. Since 2005 the band has reformed for a series of occasional one-off performances in Ireland and England. In 2012, a live album was recorded entitled \"Congregation\" and was released in October 2014.\n\nOriginally named 'Rollercoaster', Kerbdog were formed in 1991 by Cormac Battle (vocals/guitar), Colin Fennelly (bass guitar) and Darragh Butler (drums) while attending St Kieran's College secondary level school. The band went on to obtain their Leaving Certificates, but they devoted their energies to music rather than studies. Their early live shows primarily consisted of cover versions of songs by Sonic Youth, Loop, Spacemen 3 and Fudge Tunnel. Rollercoaster spent a year in London, but they failed to win much interest from the UK music press and returned to Kilkenny. \n\nBilly Dalton joined the band in early 1992 as a second guitarist and his fondness for heavy metal acts Metallica and Slayer complemented Battle's fascination with the British and New York City underground. The songs that resulted from the disparate influences of the band's primary members were visceral and cerebral. Realising that they had a potential for success with the band, Cormac, Colin, and Darragh dropped out of college and Billy left his job as a truck driver with his family's prosperous milling company. \n\nThe group changed their name to Kerbdog in honour of a Californian BMX team that they were \"obsessed with\".\n\"Darragh Butler – Kilkenny People newspaper, 2010\" \n\nAfter supporting Therapy? in Kilkenny's New Park Inn (since demolished) in February 1992, the band suggested that Kerbdog record and send off a demo to the record companies. The foursome recorded their first demo in Dublin that Summer (two songs of which later appeared as b-sides on their debut Vertigo Records single \"Earthworks\"). A second demo was recorded in December and yielded the version of \"Earthworks\" that became the aforementioned single:\n\"Darragh Butler – Kilkenny People newspaper, 2010\" \n\nIn early 1993, Kerbdog signed with Mercury Records subsidiary Vertigo Records. That summer, Kerbdog recorded their self-titled debut album at Rockfield Studios in Wales, during which time Sepultura were also there recording their 1993 album \"Chaos A.D.\" The album was produced by Jack Endino, who helped cement the Seattle grunge sound along with Sub Pop. \n\n\"If I remember right the whole thing took five weeks. No problems except that Cormac was still writing lyrics right up to the next-to-last day of mixing. Dummy Crusher was literally the last thing finished, we cut the vocal and then I mixed it next day. We had about run out of time at that point. [I] liked almost all of it. Thought the intro to EOG should have been half as long, but band disagreed; and in retrospect I would have turned up the vocals on EOG just a teeny bit, though no one ever complained. Didn't like Xenophobia much but that didn't make the album. Thought Clock should have been a single.\"<br>\n\"Jack Endino\"\nWhilst recording, Kerbdog were also planning a major tour of the British clubs. A winter support slot on The Almighty's UK tour brought added exposure, promoted by second single, \"End of Green\". The group also recorded a session for the BBC Radio One Rock Show.\n\n1994 saw another run of gigs, including a support slot with Therapy?. The debut album was released that year to acclaim, and two further singles were released, \"Dry Riser\" and \"Dummy Crusher\". The latter charted in the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart and was shown in the chart listed on BBC Television's \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nIn July 1995 the band travelled to Los Angeles to work on their second album. Produced by GGGarth, \"On The Turn\" was rehearsed at Full Blast Studios, before recording was completed at Sound City Studios and A&M Studios over the following months.\n\n\"We did one record with a band named Kerbdog, and we started off with about 25 cabinets and amps. It took about two days just to go through 'em all, but we got the best sounds that we have ever gotten. We used old Les Pauls, old Strats and Teles, different strings, different pickups.\"<br>\n\"GGGarth\"\nBilly Dalton left Kerbdog a few months after the band returned from Los Angeles. In early 1996, the Mercury Music Group was bought over by PolyGram Records, and Kerbdog shifted to Fontana Records, Vertigo's sister label at PolyGram. \"JJ's Song\" was released in July 1996 as a limited edition EP, preceding the \"Sally\" single in September 1996. In January 1997, the band recorded a session for Dave Fanning's show on RTÉ 2FM radio. Music magazines such as \"Kerrang!\" and \"Metal Hammer\" praised both Kerbdog's albums and featured them frequently, \"Kerrang!\" 's editor spent a weekend with the band in Kilkenny.\n\nThe album was repeatedly delayed before being released in the UK in March 1997, preceded by the \"Mexican Wave\" single. It sold poorly, their record label dropped the band, and their back catalogue was deleted in 1997. Kerbdog recorded a six track demo (including the track \"Soaking Wet\") at Sun Studios, Dublin in May 1997, with the aim of securing a new record deal. An unnamed record company (believed to have been Dreamworks Records, a subdivision of Geffen Records) expressed an interest in bringing the band to the United States and buying the rights to the \"On The Turn\" album from Mercury Records; an offer was made to Mercury and rejected. Without an album to promote Kerbdog with in the States, the record company declined to sign the band\n\"There were two labels that wanted to sign us at the time and came to see us supporting Placebo who, the first night, we blew away and the second night they wouldn't give us the PA in Belfast, but anyway they came to see us but they couldn't afford the album. They wanted the album and had Mercury sold that album we would have kept functioning as a band and moved straight to the States, everything was pretty much in place to do that, so I would be curious to see how much it was sold for now [2012]. I think it was about a hundred grand Sterling put on the table for the album [in 1997] but I presume the record label [Mercury], maybe wrote it off and perhaps there is a fifteen year [legal] thing or something that it's available now again.\"<br>\n\"Darragh Butler – Irishdrummers.com, 2012\"\nThe band soldiered on without a record label for about a year, but eventually disbanded and played their final gig at the Mean Fiddler, on Wexford Street in Dublin on 7 March 1998.\n\nIn 1998 Cormac and Darragh with a new bassist Mick Murphy, went on to form another band, Wilt. They played their first gig at The Funnel in Dublin on 26 March 1998. \"Rock Sound\" magazine tipped them as being Ireland's version of Hüsker Dü and Weezer. However, after two albums (\"Bastinado\" and \"My Medicine\"), Wilt broke up in 2003.\n\nFollowing Wilt's split, Kerbdog reformed in 2005. They played a total of 13 gigs in Ireland that year, most notably two sell-out concerts in February at the Temple Bar Music Centre, Dublin, followed by a set at the Oxegen music festival in July. Kerbdog continued to play occasional one-off Kilkenny and Dublin shows in both 2006 and 2007. August 2008 saw the group play the Camden Barfly in London as part of the Kerrang 'Week of Rock', and a show at the \"Pumpalooza\" in Kilkenny in aid of the Susie Long Hospice Foundation. Dalton rejoined them on stage for seven songs during the Pumphouse gig, marking the first time since 1995 that the four piece had played together. The year finished with a show at the Temple Bar Music Centre in Dublin.\n\nA tribute album entitled \"\" was released on 8 March 2010, via the Derby based record label, Stressed Sumo Records.\n\nKerbdog played the Temple House Festival in Sligo on 11 June 2011, also playing a gig at the Set Theater in Kilkenny on New Year's Eve 2011, at which 'Wilt' reformed for a few songs on the same night/stage.\n\nOn 7 April 2012 they returned to the UK to play a one-off gig in Bristol, with Souls (Butler and Dalton's new band) on the same bill, to mark the 15th anniversary of the release of \"On The Turn\". This show was the first of three recorded by Dave Draper for a future live album. In late 2012, Kerbdog also recorded their Dublin and London shows. The result, \"Congregation\", was released on 10 October 2014 as a CD/DVD package. The first date announced to complement this was an appearance at the Sonisphere festival at Knebworth on 6 July 2014.\n\nOn 16 June 2014 it was announced that guitarist Billy Dalton had re-joined Kerbdog after an 18-year absence. The group also announced that they would enter a recording studio in Evesham, the day prior to Sonisphere, to begin recording a track entitled \"Soaking Wet\" which was demo’d originally in 1997. This marks the first time the band has recorded studio material since the 1990s. The track, completed a few weeks later and retitled \"Electricity\", will be included on the new live album. A 7\" vinyl featuring \"Electricity\" and \"Pointless (live)\" was also made available. A Pledge campaign was unveiled on 23 June 2014 to help fund and promote the new releases. The campaign had reached 100% of its goal on 6 October 2014. That same day, Kerbdog recorded a studio session for Today FM radio in Dublin, first broadcast on the Paul McLoone show in November 2014. A UK tour in support of the live album took place in November 2014.\n\nIn an interview with Irish Metal Archive in 2015, Dalton confirmed that the band had plans to release an EP for which they had three new songs waiting to be recorded. Although there have been no new releases, the band have continued with sparodic live shows including a short UK tour in October 2016, as well as festival and club dates in Summer 2019.\n\n\nSingles / E.P.s\n\n<br>\nAlbums\n<br>\n\n<br>\nLive Albums\n<br>\n\n<br>\nOther\n<br>\n\n<br>\nDemos\n<br>\n\n<br>\nRadio Sessions\n<br>\n\n"}

{"id": "1847794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847794", "title": "North Borneo Chartered Company", "text": "North Borneo Chartered Company\n\nThe North Borneo Chartered Company (NBCC), also known as the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) was a British chartered company formed on 1 November 1881 to administer and exploit the resources of North Borneo (present-day Sabah in Malaysia). The territory became a protectorate of the British Empire in 1888 but the company remained involved with the territory until 1946, when administration was fully assumed by the Crown colony government.\n\nThe company also temporarily administered the island of Labuan in 1890 before it became part of the Straits Settlements. The company motto was \"Pergo et Perago\", which means \"I persevere and I achieve\" in Latin. Its founder and first chairman was Alfred Dent.\n\nThe company was founded along similar lines as the British East India Company. German businessman and diplomat Baron von Overbeck, along with the heads of a British trading company in Shanghai and London, Alfred Dent and Edward Dent, together met with the thalassocratic rulers of the northern Borneo area to obtain a concession for their colonial interests. The governor of Labuan, a British colonial island off Brunei, accompanied the negotiations. On 29 December 1877, they met Abdul Momin, Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan agreed to make the concession for 15,000 Spanish dollars. However, since it turned out that the Sultan of Brunei had already ceded some areas to the Sultan of Sulu, further negotiations were needed. With the assistance of William Clark Cowie, a Scottish adventurer and friend of Sultan Jamal-ul Azam of Sulu, the Sultan signed a concession treaty on 22 January 1878 and received 5,000 Spanish dollars.\n\nFollowing the successful concessions, Overbeck and the Dent brothers became the rulers of an area in northern Borneo. Overbeck withdrew in 1879 after failing to attract the interest of his country, leaving Alfred Dent to manage the territory. Dent then planned to register a company to represent the British but since a considerably delay seemed likely, he decided to found a provisional company first. In 1881, the British North Borneo Provisional Association Limited was founded with registered capital of £300,000. The directors were Dent himself together with Rutherford Alcock, Richard Biddulph Martin, Admiral Richard Mayne and William Henry Read. The charter contract for a company with a capital of two million pounds was sealed on 1 November 1881.\n\nThe provisional company was thus dissolved and the following year, a chartered company was established with a first settlement on Gaya Island. The settlement however was burnt down during a raid by a local leader named Mat Salleh and was never re-established. Due to such resistance, establishing law and order as well as recruiting Sikh policemen from northern India became one of the company's earlies priorities, along with expanding trade; instituting a government, courts, and penal system; building a railway line from Jesselton to Tenom; and encouraging the harvesting and barter trade of local crops, as well as establishment of plantations. The company also faced some resistance to its economic modernisations and tax policies.\n\nNo other state in the British Commonwealth was as devastated by the Second World War as North Borneo. By the end of the war, it was already foreseeable that the company would be unable to finance remediation for the devastation to land and infrastructure. The company therefore waived the further use of their charter and gave British North Borneo to the British Colonial Office. With the signing of an agreement on 26 June 1946, the company officially dissolved. From 15 July 1946 until the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, North Borneo was a Crown colony. The agreement with the British government included a £860,000 immediate cash settlement that allowed the company to settle outstanding financial claims. The government's offer to repay all other claims by paying 2.2 million pounds had already been rejected by the company. For the negotiation of further financial compensation, the British government appointed Lord Uthwatt as an independent arbitrator. In March 1949, Uthwatt announced the result of his investigations: £1,400,000 should be awarded to the company as compensation; any claims related to war damage would not be included. The news triggered a bitter disappointment among shareholders. In just overnight, the value of the company share fell from 17s to 9s 6p.\n\nWith the founding of the company, the administrative divisions of North Borneo introduced by Overbeck were maintained by the establishment of the West Coast Residency and the East Coast Residency. The seat of the two residents was in Sandakan, where the governor was based. Each residency, in turn, was divided into several provinces managed by a district officer. Over time, the number of residencies increased to five: Tawau Residency (also known as East Coast Residency), Sandakan Residency, West Coast Residency, Kudat Residency, and Interior Residency. The provinces were initially named after the members of the board: Alcock, Cunlife, Dewhurst, Keppel, Dent, Martin, Elphinstone, Myburgh and Mayne. The senior residents occupied Sandakan and the West Coast, while the other three residents with the second class residencies occupied Interior, East Coast and Kudat. The residents of Sandakan and West Coast were members of the Legislative Council, the Legislative Assembly of the Company.\n\nThe election of Cowie to the board of directors in 1894 marked the beginning of a major change in the style of administration: Before, North Borneo was governed by the company, and the governors were fully empowered and fully responsible. But since Cowie took over, he mostly pulled strings from London. Instead of the development of North Borneo, the satisfaction of the shareholders was in the foreground. Alfred Dent, who fiercely opposed Cowie's costly and money-wasting ideas, finally resigned and withdrew from the company.\n\nUnder Neill Malcolm, the administration was ordered to strictly supervise expenditure. Several governors reduced the number of district officers by eliminating the posts in Ranau, Pensiangan, Tenom, Sipitang, Penampang, Tuaran, Langkon, Lamag, Beluran and Semporna. Douglas James Jardine, who become the governor in 1934, completed the process by merging the Tawau Residency with the Sandakan Residency on the one hand and the Interior Residency with the West Coast on the other hand. He also removed the District Officer in Papar.\n\nMunicipal administration was governed by the Village Ordinance of 1891. This ordinance fundamentally changed the status of the chiefs, the traditional indigenous tribal leaders. Following its implementation, the company only accepted those chiefs who had appointed them as community leaders. Other chieftains, who had played an important role for generations, were either shut down or branded as criminals or troublemakers. Disrespect for these traditional leaders contributed to the spirit of local resistance led by tribal group such as Mat Salleh and Ontoros Antanum.\n\nThe company had two responsibilities, namely:\n\nThe first governor of North Borneo, William Hood Treacher, devoted himself especially to the elimination of slavery. However, the land laws issued by him in no way respected the traditional land rights of the inhabitants. The second governor, Charles Vandeleur Creagh, in 1888, issued several proclamations that largely secured foreigners' access to land. A board of directors in London determined the tasks of the company over the governors. Locally, directors over-ruled the governor's instructions. The company established a state power, issued laws (proclamations), recruited Sikh policemen from northern India. Courts were set up to enforce the laws. Furthering the economic exploitation of the area was the construction of a railway line (North Borneo Railway) from Jesselton to Weston and Melalap, the promotion of trade and the establishment of plantations. Effective from 1 March 1883, the periodical North Borneo Herald and Official Gazette was published to disseminate the decisions of the Court of Directors, both within the administrative units of North Borneo, and the company's shareholders and investors.\n\nA major contribution to the consolidation of the administrative area was made by William Hood Treacher. In tough negotiations with the White Rajahs, he managed to bring territories to the company that were not included in the original leases. These includes Pengalat (1883), Klias Peninsular (1884), Mantanani (1885), Padas (1889) and the area of Sipitang, Bongawan to Tuaran (1889). From 1889, the island of Labuan was also part of the company administrative territory.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands had already installed a trading post in Borneo shortly after the founding of the Dutch East India Company, there were no noteworthy activities by the Dutch on the east coast of northern Borneo. This changed in 1846 when the Dutch signed a contract with the Sultan of Bulungan, who assured the Dutch control of the area. At the instigation of the Dutch, the sultan married his son in 1867 with the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan, whereby the Dutch sphere of influence finally reached the region around Tawau. The north of the Dutch area which overlapped with an area that was claimed by the Sultanate of Sulu for themselves. A conflict with the British was therefore inevitable when in 1878 the Sultan of Sulu placed the southern boundary of his land for tax to Overbeck on the Sibuku River. In settling the border disputes, the company negotiated with the Dutch from the 1880s onwards to define the boundary between the area granted by the Sultan of Sulu and the area claimed by the Dutch on the basis of the treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan. On 20 January 1891, they finally agreed on a line along 4°10' north latitude – which corresponded to a central division of the island of Sebatik.\n\nOn 5 January 1905, the company territory of Lawas – a controversial border area of the province of Clark was relinquished to the neighbouring Sarawak and in exchange for “certain coal fields at the Brunei Bay”.\n\nThe head of the Company was the chairman of the board of Directors, since 1910 officially named as \"President\":\n\n"}

The arena was opened on January 27, 1998, and dedicated to the memory of the late Paul Tsongas, prominent Lowell native and U.S. senator. The arena was built with $4 million in funding from both the city and the university, plus another $20 million contributed from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nThe facility is home to the NCAA Division I University of Massachusetts Lowell River Hawks ice hockey team, which competes in the Hockey East Association and men's basketball team which play for the America East Conference. The facility was also home to the Lowell Lock Monsters and the Lowell Devils ice hockey team, which competed in the American Hockey League from 1998 to 2010. The Devils ended their stay in Lowell due to financial difficulties and the arena's new ownership and moved to Albany, NY to compete as the Albany Devils.\n\nThe Tsongas Center - which seats approximately 6,000 for hockey and 7,000 for concerts and other events - is the site of major concerts and other public events, including job fairs, skating competitions and graduation ceremonies for area high schools, colleges and universities. It also hosts major university events, such as the annual Commencement ceremonies, Open House for prospective students and the Chancellor's Speaker Series. The series debuted in 2012 with bestselling author Stephen King. Also in 2012, the Tsongas Center was the site of a debate between then-incumbent U.S. Sen. Scott Brown and challenger Elizabeth Warren, which drew more than 5,000 people and was covered by more than 100 media outlets, including NBC News and MSNBC.\n\nIn 2004, alternative rock pioneers Pixies recorded their live concert DVD and high-definition television special \"The Pixies: Come Home Live 2004 World Tour\" at the Tsongas Arena. The same year, progressive rock band Yes released a DVD of their 35th anniversary tour performance at the venue titled \"Songs from Tsongas\".\n\nIn 2009, the boxing scenes of the 2010 film \"The Fighter\" were filmed at the Tsongas Center, with Mark Wahlberg portraying Lowell-born champion boxer Micky Ward and Christian Bale portraying his brother Dicky Eklund.\n\nUMass Lowell and the city of Lowell entered into negotiations in 2009 with the intent to transfer ownership of the arena and the land adjacent to it to the university. In late October 2009, it was reported that the deal had been reached with UMass Lowell committing to major renovations to the facility. In a ceremony during a game against Boston University on October 30, 2009, the deal transferring ownership to the university was signed. UMass Lowell formally took control of the arena on February 5, 2010 after completing a $1 transaction.\n\nUMass Lowell has spent more than $5 million to renovate the arena since its acquisition. LED \"ribbon\" boards were installed in the winter of 2010. A new high-definition video scoreboard and sound system were installed during the summer 2010. A new club seating area was built in conjunction with a new upscale bar. In the summer of 2011, new ice-making equipment was installed, followed by new luxury boxes and press box in 2012.\n\nIn March 2017, the arena played host to the second NWHL Isobel Cup finals between the Buffalo Beauts and Boston Pride.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847817", "title": "Nancy Benoit", "text": "Nancy Benoit\n\nNancy Elizabeth Benoit (née Toffoloni, formerly Daus and Sullivan; May 17, 1964 – June 22, 2007) was an American professional wrestling valet, occasional professional wrestler and model. She was best known for her appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling in the mid-1990s under the ring name Woman.\n\nAfter graduating from DeLand (Florida) High School, Nancy got a job answering phones at State Farm Insurance. When George Napolitano needed a beautiful young girl for the cover of the June 1984 edition of the pro-wrestling magazine \"Wrestling All Stars\", fellow photographer Bill Otten suggested the 20-year-old Nancy Toffoloni Daus for the role. Nancy, who had worked as a model, often sat alongside her then-husband Jim. She had also been selling programs at the Orlando shows and appeared as Para in \"Apartment Wrestling\" features. It was on this shoot where she met Kevin Sullivan, who eventually wanted her to be a part of his wrestling entourage. After months of convincing, Nancy finally became an on-air valet, taking the ring name \"Fallen Angel\".\n\nShe made her in-ring debut on June 30, 1984, in Miami, Florida, for Florida Championship Wrestling.\n\nShe became a part of Kevin Sullivan's stable of kayfabe \"Satanists\", which also included wrestlers The Lock, Luna Vachon, The Purple Haze, and Sir Oliver Humperdink. Nancy and Kevin Sullivan traveled throughout the United States using the \"Satanist\" gimmick for promotions such as Angelo Savoldi's ICW and Southwest Championship Wrestling. The two married in 1985. On August 3, 1985, she wrestled Debbie Combs in Hawaii for NWA Polynesian Wrestling, in which she lost by disqualification.\n\nShe first appeared in WCW as a \"fan\" of Rick Steiner named Robin Green, wearing a Steiner T-shirt and large glasses. She would sit in the audience and would interact with Steiner whenever he appeared. She eventually turned on him, aligning herself with Kevin Sullivan and adopting the name Woman and becoming the manager of Doom (Butch Reed and Ron Simmons). After leaving Doom, she aligned herself with Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen.\n\nIn late 1993, Sullivan and Nancy joined the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling, where she reverted to the ring name \"Woman\". In December 1993, Sullivan and The Tazmaniac won the ECW Tag Team Championship. They held the championship until March 1994, when they were defeated by The Public Enemy.\n\nAfter Sullivan left ECW in spring 1994, Woman began managing The Sandman. The Sandman's character was estranged from his wife and valet, Peaches, who had left him after he accidentally struck her during a match while temporarily blinded. Woman drove a wedge between The Sandman and Peaches, convincing him that Peaches was cheating on him with Tommy Cairo. In keeping with The Sandman's character, Woman would open his beers and light his cigarettes prior to matches. She began carrying a Singapore cane with which she would strike The Sandman's opponents. At \"When Worlds Collide\" on May 14, 1994, Woman and The Sandman lost to Cairo and Peaches in a Singapore Cane match, after which Peaches caned The Sandman in the groin until Woman threw salt in her eyes, enabling The Sandman to regroup and cane Cairo and Peaches.\n\nIn mid-1994, The Sandman began feuding with Tommy Dreamer after he kissed Woman. The feud culminated in an \"I Quit\" match on October 1, 1994, during which The Sandman was seemingly blinded when Dreamer pushed a lit cigarette into his eye and then caned him in the face. Following the bout, Woman announced that she was leaving The Sandman as he was now \"useless\". After Tommy Cairo mocked The Sandman, a guilt-stricken Dreamer challenged him to a match at November to Remember on November 5, 1994. At the same event, Peaches attempted to reconcile with The Sandman. Woman interrupted the reconciliation, caning Peaches and threatening The Sandman. After Dreamer came to the ring to stop Woman, The Sandman revealed that he was not in fact blinded and attacked Dreamer, with his estrangement from Woman a ploy to pit Dreamer and Cairo against one another.\n\nIn April 1995, Woman again left The Sandman, aligning herself with Shane Douglas. At Hostile City Showdown on April 15, 1995, she helped The Sandman defeat Douglas for his second ECW World Heavyweight Championship by striking him in the knee with a Singapore cane, revealing the turn to have been another ruse.\n\nFollowing The Sandman's victory, Woman began carrying the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to ringside. Throughout mid-1995, she helped The Sandman defend his championship in a series of bouts with Cactus Jack. In September 1995, she began also managing The Sandman's ally, ECW World Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio. In late 1995, The Sandman began feuding with Mikey Whipwreck, during which a controversial storyline began in which Woman became visibly aroused while watching The Sandman cane Whipwreck. The Sandman's reign lasted until October 28, 1995, when he lost to Whipwreck in a ladder match after Stunning Steve Austin prevented Woman from interfering.\n\nOn October 28, 1995, 2 Cold Scorpio defeated Rocco Rock in a singles bout to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship, then selected The Sandman as his partner. The Sandman regained the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in a three-way dance with Whipwreck and Austin at December to Dismember on December 9, 1995, giving Woman control of all three championships.\n\nOn December 29, 1995, at Holiday Hell, Mikey Whipwreck defeated 2 Cold Scorpio in a singles match with the ECW World Tag Team Championship on the line. The Sandman's third reign as ECW World Heavyweight Champion lasted until January 27, 1996, when he lost to Raven. On the January 27, 1996 episode of \"ECW Hardcore TV\", Woman announced that she was returning to World Championship Wrestling, parting ways with The Sandman and 2 Cold Scorpio.\n\nWoman made her return to WCW on the January 22, 1996 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" as one of many women who stood in the aisle and waved as Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage came to the ring. On the February 5 episode of \"Nitro\" she turned on Savage during his match with Chris Benoit and rejoined Flair, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Benoit in the then-current incarnation of the Four Horsemen. Miss Elizabeth also managed the stable.\n\nIn 1996, Pillman had left the Horsemen, but they added Steve McMichael and his wife Debra in June, which didn't sit well with Woman. In her next angle, the two bickered, not getting along in general. The Four Horsemen were often given interview time on \"Nitro\" and when it came time for Debra to speak on the mic, she'd often go into a soliloquy regarding Woman's looks and fashion sense – usually when the two weren't within the vicinity of each other. Despite the heavy tension, the two managers never had a physical altercation.\n\nAt the same time, she started an on-screen relationship with Benoit, who at the time was involved in a feud with her real-life husband, Kevin Sullivan. On December 7, on \"WCW Saturday Night\", during a post-match interview with Sullivan, a home movie of the couple canoodling in a kitchen was played in front of him. Woman taunted Sullivan by saying, \"You can't find me\" and \"I'm my own woman,\" while Benoit added: \"You consider yourself the master of human chess. Well, my bishop just took your queen\". After the video, Sullivan stood there speechless, and his manager Jimmy Hart led him off stage. This feud between Benoit and Sullivan saw Woman clashing with Sullivan's then-valet Jacquelyn at ringside. In one match, the two ladies were strapped together, took shots at each other, and used the strap connecting them as a weapon against the men.\n\nEventually, the Benoit-Nancy on-screen relationship developed into a real-life affair off-screen. Because of this, it is often joked that Kevin Sullivan \"booked his own divorce.\" The two were indeed divorced in 1997. What's more, Sullivan lost a retirement match to Benoit. His intent had been to retire from in-ring action and focus on booking.\n\nNancy's final WCW appearance (and professional wrestling appearance as Woman) took place on May 26, 1997, on \"Monday Nitro\" as she accompanied Benoit to the ring for a confrontation with Jimmy Hart regarding the whereabouts of Sullivan, who wasn't in the arena. On the following week's show, Benoit came alone to ringside without her by his side. After managing him for a little over half a year, no reason was given for Woman's sudden disappearance, and she was never mentioned on WCW programming again.\n\nBefore her marriage to Kevin Sullivan in 1985, Nancy had been married to and divorced from Jim Daus.\n\nIn early 1997, while Nancy was married to Sullivan, she was having an extramarital affair with Chris Benoit. Nancy and Benoit became engaged later in 1997 after her divorce from Sullivan, although Benoit referred to Nancy as only his fiancée even after they were married. She managed her husband's career from their home in Atlanta.\n\nShe gave birth to their son Daniel Christopher Benoit on February 25, 2000. Nancy married Chris Benoit on November 23, 2000. However, in May 2003, she filed for divorce, citing the marriage as \"irrevocably broken\" and alleging \"cruel treatment.\" She dropped the suit in August 2003, as well as a restraining order filed on her husband.\n\nIn December 2005, Nancy had back and neck fusion surgery with Lloyd Youngblood, the same surgeon who had previously done a 3–hour neck operation on Nancy's husband Chris on June 28, 2001.\n\nAfter Nancy's death in 2007, \"Hustler\" published nude photographs of her from a shoot taken when she was 20 years old. The length of time between the events caused controversy, causing critics to claim that Hustler owner Larry Flynt was attempting to capitalize on the event. The family of Nancy Benoit took legal action against Hustler. The appellate court ruled that, \"The photographs published by [Flynt] neither relate to the incident of public concern conceptually [the murders] nor correspond with the time period during which Benoit was rendered, against her will, the subject of public scrutiny\".\n\nOn June 25, 2007, Benoit, her husband Chris, and their son Daniel were found dead in their home in suburban Atlanta at around 2:30 p.m. It first was reported by the WWE Mobile Alerts service and posted to their official website soon after.\n\nLieutenant Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department told \"ABC News\" it was being investigated as a double murder-suicide, and the police were not searching for any suspects outside of the house, as the instruments of death were located at the scene of the crime.\n\nDuring a press conference on June 26, Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard reported that Chris Benoit had killed his wife and son and committed suicide. A Bible was left by Nancy's body, and she died of asphyxiation. She had bruises on her back and stomach consistent with an attacker pressing a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck. Daniel also died of asphyxiation, without signs of restraint. He had internal injuries to the throat area, but no bruises, indicating he may have been killed by a choke. Chris killed Nancy on Friday, Daniel on Saturday, then asphyxiated himself with the cord of a weight machine in his basement on Sunday.\n\nA memorial for Nancy and Daniel took place in Daytona Beach, Florida, on July 14, 2007. Both were cremated and their ashes placed in starfish-shaped urns for Nancy's family. Chris was also cremated, but the fate of his ashes has not been publicly revealed.\n\n"}

{"id": "1847838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847838", "title": "Ascophyllum", "text": "Ascophyllum\n\nAscophyllum nodosum is a large, common cold water seaweed or brown alga (Phaeophyceae) in the family Fucaceae, being the only species in the genus Ascophyllum. It is a seaweed that only grows in the northern Atlantic Ocean, also known in localities as feamainn bhuí, rockweed, Norwegian kelp, knotted kelp, knotted wrack or egg wrack. It is common on the north-western coast of Europe (from Svalbard to Portugal) including east Greenland and the north-eastern coast of North America, its range further south of these latitudes being limited by warmer ocean waters.\n\n\"Ascophyllum nodosum\" has long tough and leathery fronds, irregularly dichotomously branched fronds with large, egg-shaped air bladders set in series at regular intervals along the fronds and not stalked. The fronds can reach 2 m in length and are attached by a holdfast to rocks and boulders. The fronds are olive-green, olive-brown in color and somewhat compressed, but without a midrib.\n\nIts life history is of one diploid plant and gametes. Each individual plant is either male or female. The gametes are produced in the spring in conceptacles embedded in yellowish receptacles on short branches.\n\nSeveral different varieties and forms of this species have been described.\n\nFree-floating forms of this species are found in, for example, \"A. n. mackaii\" Cotton, which is found at very sheltered locations, such as at the heads of sea lochs in Scotland and Ireland.\n\n\"Ascophyllum nodosum\" is found mostly on sheltered sites on shores in the midlittoral, where it can become the dominant species in the littoral zone.\n\nThe species is found in a range of coastal habitats from sheltered estuaries to moderately exposed coasts, and often it dominates the intertidal zone (although subtidal populations are known to exist in very clear waters). However, it is rarely found on exposed shores, and if it is found, the fronds are usually small and badly scratched.\nThis seaweed grows quite slowly, 0.5% per day, carrying capacity is about 40 kg wet weight per square meter, and it may live for 10–15 years. It may typically overlap in distribution with \"Fucus vesiculosus\" and \"Fucus serratus\". Its distribution is also limited by salinity, wave exposure, temperature, desiccation, and general stress. It may take approximately five years before becoming fertile.\n\nPhlorotannins in \"A. nodosum\" act as chemical defenses against the marine herbivorous snail, \"Littorina littorea\".\n\n\"Polysiphonia lanosa\" (L.) T.A. Christensen is a small red alga, commonly found growing in dense tufts on \"Ascophyllum\" whose rhizoids penetrate the host. It is considered by some as parasitic; however, as it only receives structural support from knotted wrack (not parasitically), it acts as an epiphyte.\n\nThis species has been recorded in Europe from Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Britain and Isle of Man, Netherlands, and North America from the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Baffin Island, Hudson Strait, Labrador, and Newfoundland. It has been recorded as an accidental introduction near San Francisco, California, and eradicated as a potential invasive species.\n\n\"Ascophyllum nodosum\" is harvested for use in alginates, fertilisers, and the manufacture of seaweed meal for animal and human consumption. It has long been used as an organic and mainstream fertilizer for many varieties of crops due to its combination of both macronutrients, (N, P, and K) and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, etc.). It also contains cytokinins, auxin-like gibberellins, betaines, mannitol, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids, and proteins which are all very beneficial and widely used in agriculture. \nIreland, Scotland and Norway have provided the world's principal alginate supply.\n\n\"Ascophyllum nodosum\" is frequently used as packaging material for baitworm and lobster shipments from New England to various domestic and international locations. \"Ascophyllum\" itself has occasionally been introduced to California, and several species frequently found in baitworm shipments, including \"Carcinus maenas\" and \"Littorina saxatilis\", may have been introduced to the San Francisco Bay region this way.\n\nBecause the age of the different parts of \"A. nodosum\" can be identified by its shoots, it has also been used to monitor concentrations of heavy metals in seawater. A concentration factor for zinc has been reported to be of the order 10.\n\n\"Ascophyllum nodosum\" contains the phlorotannins tetraphlorethol C and tetrafucol A.\n\nControversy exists over impacts of commercial harvesting of \"A. nodosum\" for use in garden or crop fertilizers and livestock feed supplements in North America and Europe. Some research has been focused on bycatch and impact on intertidal zone communities.\n\nOpponents of its wild harvest point to the algae's high habitat value for over 100 marine species, including benthic invertebrates,\n\nThis article incorporates CC BY-2.5 text from the reference\n"}

He is also the founder and was the 1st President of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) from its formation in 1946 to his resignation in 1951 and was also responsible for the social and economic welfare of the Malays by setting up the Rural Industrial Development Authority (RIDA). His son is Hussein Onn, the 3rd and former Prime Minister of Malaysia, his grandson is the current Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hishammuddin Hussein, and his great-grandson is Onn Hafiz Ghazi, the current Member of the Johor State Legislative Assembly for Layang-Layang.\n\nOnn's father Jaafar Muhammad, the former Chief Minister of Johor. His mother was Roquaiya Hanim (also spelled Rogayah Hanim or Rukiye Hanım; 1864–1904), who came from the Caucasus region of the Ottoman Empire (there are different hypotheses regarding her ethnicity). She was likely presented as a concubine (see Circassian beauties) by the Ottoman court to the sultan of Johor. His mother was married three times and the last time was with his father. As Onn Jaafar's family had close relations with the Johor palace, Sultan Ibrahim treated him as an adopted son. He started his education in a Malay school in Johor Bahru. In 1904, he went to England to attend Aldeburgh Lodge School, a private school in Suffolk, with the then Tengku Mahkota until 1909. He excelled in sports and captained the school’s cricket and football teams.\n\nHe returned to Malaya and was enrolled at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK) where he studied there for two years from 1910 to 1911. According to biographer Ramlah Adam, one of the main reasons for him to enroll at MCKK was the need to improve his Malay language proficiency that had weakened considerably following his time in England.\n\nAfter graduating from MCKK, he worked as a trainee clerk at the Johor Government Secretary office and was made a permanent clerk a year later. He served in this capacity in several departments before joining the Johor Military Forces in 1917 with the rank of lieutenant. Two years later, he rejoined the civil service. Soon later, he found himself in trouble with the Johor palace after expressing his unhappiness over the sale of his family’s ancestral home. The royal palace did not take the issue kindly and terminated his service in June 1920. He rejoined the service again in 1921 as an Assistant Collector of Land Revenue.\n\nEarly Malay nationalism took root in Johor during the 1920s, he became a journalist and wrote articles on the welfare of the Malays. Some of Onn's articles were critical of Sultan Ibrahim's policies, which led to strained personal relations with the Sultan. In particular, Sultan Ibrahim expelled Onn from Johor in 1927 after he published an article in the \"Sunday Mirror\", a Singapore-based English tabloid, which criticised the Sultan's poor treatment of the Johor Military Forces personnel and the welfare of the Orang Asli. He went into exile in Singapore and became the editor of a Malay paper, \"Warta Malaya\", in 1930. Over the next six years, he edited four other newspapers including \"Lembaga Malaya\", \"Warta Ahad\" and \"Lembaga\". Onn became very popular after he continued to cover issues on Malay grievances, and Sultan Ibrahim invited Onn to return to Johor in 1936.\n\nFollowing the Japanese occupation of Malaya in 1941, Onn was drafted into the administrative system and served as a food controller in Johor.\n\nAlong with his companions, Haji Anwar bin Abdul Malik, Haji Syed Alwi bin Syed Sheikh al-Hadi and Mohamad Noah Omar, they founded the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) as a means to rally the Malays against the Malayan Union, which was perceived as threatening Malay privileges and the position of the Malay rulers. Onn took up the role of UMNO's president on 1 May 1946.\n\nThe Malayan Union proposal provided that United Kingdom had full administrative powers over the Malay states except in areas pertaining spiritual and moral authority of the Malay rulers, which the Malays held high esteem over it. Communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese were high, and the prospect of granting citizenship to non-Malays was deemed unacceptable to the Malays. In particular, politicians in Johor were extremely unhappy with the willingness of Sultan Ibrahim to sign the treaties with Harold MacMichael, and voiced out that the Sultan had violated the terms in the Johor state constitution which explicitly forbade any foreign powers to assume legitimate control over the state.\nIn early February 1946, seven political dissidents led by Awang bin Hassan organised a rally to protest against the Sultan's decision for signing the treaties, and Onn Jaafar, who was then serving as a district officer in Batu Pahat, was invited to attend the rally. The rally was held on 1 February 1946 at the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, and protesters shouted nationalistic slogans and called for the dethronement of Sultan Ibrahim. Malay nationalistic slogans were raised during the rally, many of whom were directed against the Sultan himself, whom they accused him for committing treason against the Malay race by signing the treaties.\n\nNews of the rally reached the Sultan Ibrahim on 22 February, who was then residing at Grosvenor House in London. Sultan Ibrahim approached the colonial office and expressed his withdrawal of support for the proposal scheme, but this did not appease the political dissidents and Onn continued to organise more rallies in the other Malay states to muster further support for his calls against the Malayan Union, and formed United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in May.\n\nTo appease the Malays and the UMNO leaders, including Onn himself, Sultan Ibrahim personally donated a lump sum of $5,000 to UMNO and Onn was appointed the Menteri Besar of Johor in 1946.\n\nThe establishment of the Federation of Malaya did not go down well with the ethnic Chinese, whereby favourable conditions for obtaining citizenship for the Chinese and other non-Malays were withdrawn. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was formed in 1949 under the leadership of a Straits Chinese businessman, Tan Cheng Lock who frequently raised grievances over the citizenship terms that were set when the Federation was established. As a result, communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese surfaced, and Onn kept his distance from Tan. Tan encountered initial difficulties with meeting Sultan Ibrahim, who was not accustomed to working with Chinese businessmen.\n\nSultan Ibrahim also became increasingly disappointed in Onn's work commitment, whom he saw as neglecting state affairs as a result of his commitments towards UMNO. In early 1950, Sultan Ibrahim approached Onn, who was asked to choose between committing his efforts for UMNO and the state. Onn chose to the former, and resigned as the Menteri Besar of Johor in May.\n\nOnn became increasingly disgusted with what he considered to be UMNO's race based communalist policies, and called for party membership to be opened to all Malayans, and for UMNO to be renamed as the United Malayans National Organisation. When his recommendations went unheeded, he left the party on 26 August 1951, to form the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). However, the IMP failed to receive sufficient backing from Malayans, and eventually Onn left it to form the Parti Negara, which placed membership restrictions on non-Malays in an attempt to woo the Malays. He finally won the Kuala Terengganu Selatan seat in the Malayan parliament in the 1959 elections under his new party.\n\nNeither party gained popular support against Tunku Abdul Rahman's new Alliance coalition and he was eventually eclipsed in Malayan political life.\n\nSeveral places were named after him, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He makes a pitch for Reebok that is rejected, though the pitch is later used in the meeting by his \"partner\" Jackie (Tamala Jones), who presents it as hers. As he takes the train home from work, Kevin meets Abbey (Emmanuelle Chriqui), with whom he finds he has much in common, such as their mutual interest in the Chicago Cubs and Al Green.\n\nKevin tries to find Abbey by making posters imploring Abbey to contact him, and placing them all over town. He goes out with a few random women who respond, none of whom are Abbey. The local newspaper finds out about his search and sets up an interview. The reporter, Brady Frances (Dan Montgomery, Jr.), is an old classmate who harbors ill will toward Kevin, on account of a girl in high school who rejected Brady for Kevin. When Brady's article is published, Kevin gets hundreds of calls, which leads to his dateless roommates — aspiring musician Rod (Joey Fatone); slacker Eric (GQ); and art aficionado Randy (James Bulliard) — suggesting they date all the callers to help. Kevin rejects this idea, but a miscommunication leads Eric to believe that Kevin has approved it. A follow up article is published in which Brady portrays Kevin as a failure, which garners even more calls from women. Brady is further irritated when his girlfriend Julie (Amanda Foreman), who is bothered by his grudge against Kevin, takes Kevin's side.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbey is having problems with her boyfriend of three years, whom she was visiting when she met Kevin. Her boyfriend buys tickets to an Al Green concert, but then cancels at the last minute. Kevin is also at the concert, but they never see each other, despite several close calls. As Kevin's roommates date the women who responded to the articles in order to find Abbey, they encounter Julie. When she tells Brady that Kevin's friends are answering the calls and dating the respondents, Brady reports this as a scam in a follow-up article. As a result, Reebok declines to work with Kevin, and he is taken off the project. When Kevin subsequently sees Abbey waiting for a train, he tries to get her attention but she only sees him after she boards the train, and the doors close before he can get to her. Kevin also learns that Abbey responded to his public search for her, and when he learns that Eric went out on a date with her, he punches Eric.\n\nAfter Kevin's best friend at the agency, Nathan (Jerry Stiller), suffers a heart attack, Kevin visits him at a rehab facility, where Nathan tells him the story of both meeting his wife at a Chicago Cubs game, and catching a home run from Cubs legend Ernie Banks the same day, and how the two events are tied together. He gives Kevin the baseball and tells him to try to find Abbey again.\n\nJackie apologizes to Kevin, and places him in charge of the campaign's billboards. He uses the billboards to publicly ask Abbey to meet him at the train station at a specific day and time, which garners the interest of the media, who wait with him at the scheduled time. Kevin and Abbey are reunited at the station, much to the delight of the crowd at the station, to the television viewers at home, and to his roommates watching this unfold in a bar. In addition, Randy meets a woman who enjoys art as he does, Julie dumps Brady for Rod, who is offered a recording contract by a record label after listening to a demo tape of his that Kevin sent them, and Brady is given an advice column in the Living section of the \"Chicago Times\".\n\n\n\nAccording to a DVD release, the film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe original screenplay for the film would have received an R rating, but was rewritten to a PG so that it could be marketed to NSYNC fans.\n\nThe short film on which the film was based starred Troy Garity, Charlie O'Connell, and Eric Michael Cole.\n\nDuring the credits of the film, the film features a comedic clip of Lance Bass and Joey Fatone who played two of the main characters being made up by fellow NSYNC members Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick. Timberlake and Kirkpatrick played wardrobe managers yet NSYNC member JC Chasez failed to appear.\n\nThe film was produced on a US$16 million budget. Miramax marketed the film heavily towards *NSYNC's teen fans, and the film's soundtrack featured songs by teen pop artists Mandy Moore and BB Mak, along with previously unreleased tracks by *NSYNC and Britney Spears. However, the film was a box-office flop, and grossed only $4.3 million domestically.\n\nThe film was heavily criticized, especially by Roger Ebert, who said the film was \"...an agonizingly creaky movie that laboriously plods through a plot so contrived that the only thing real about it is its length.\"\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 19% 'rotten' rating with the consensus stating \"An inept attempt at a romantic comedy aimed at 'NSYNC fans.\"\n\n"}

The town stands directly opposite the Mongolian border town of Altanbulag. Population: From 1727 it was the border crossing for the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China.\n\nThe Buryat name means \"place covered with couch grass,\" and is derived from Mongolian word , meaning \"couch grass\".\n\nThe region where Kyakhta stands is a natural location for Russo-Chinese trade. The Siberian River Routes connect the fur-bearing lands of Siberia to Lake Baikal. From there, the Selenga River valley is the natural route through the mountains southeast of Lake Baikal out onto the plains of Mongolia.\n\nKyakhta was founded in 1727 soon after the Treaty of Kyakhta was negotiated just north at Selenginsk. It was the starting point of the boundary markers that defined what is now the northern border of Mongolia. Kyakhta's founder, the Serb Sava Vladislavich, established it as a trading point between Russia and the Qing Empire. The Manchus built Maimaicheng just south of Kyakhta on their side of the border. Before 1762, state caravans traveled from Kyakhta to Peking. After that date, trade was mostly by barter at Kyakhta-Maimaicheng, with merchants crossing the border to make their business.\nKyakhta and Maimaicheng were visited by the famous English adventurer and engineer Samuel Bentham in 1782. He related that he was entertained by the commander of the Chinese city \"with the greatest politeness which a stranger can meet with in any country whatever\". At that time, the Russians sold furs, textiles, clothing, hides, leather, hardware, and cattle, while the Chinese sold silk, cotton stuffs, teas, fruits, porcelain, rice, candles, rhubarb, ginger, and musk. Much of the tea is said to have come from Yangloudong, a major center of tea production and trade near today's Chibi City, Hubei.\n\nKyakhta was crowded, unclean, ill-planned, and never came to reflect the wealth that flowed through it, although several Neoclassical buildings were erected in the 19th century, including a tea bourse (1842) and the Orthodox cathedral (1807–1817), both of which still stand. In 1996 the Voskreskenskaya church was being used a stable. It was from Kyakhta that Nikolay Przhevalsky, Grigory Potanin, Pyotr Kozlov, and Vladimir Obruchev set off on their expeditions into the interior of Mongolia and Xinjiang.\n\nTown status was granted to Kyakhta in 1805.\n\nAfter the entire Russian-Chinese frontier was opened to trade in 1860 and the Trans-Siberian and the Chinese Eastern Railways bypassed it, Kyakhta fell into decline. The town was renamed Troitskosavsk during the first part of the 20th century, but the original name was restored in 1935. Other sources have Troitskosavsk as a fort a short distance north, Troitskosavsk being the administrative and military center while Kyakhta was the trading post on the border.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, a branch railway was built from Ulan-Ude (on the Trans-Siberian) to Mongolia's Ulan Bator, and, eventually, to China, paralleling the old Kyakhta trade route. However, this railway crosses the Russian-Mongolian border not in Kyakhta itself, but in nearby Naushki.\n\nAs the first market town on the border between the Russian and Chinese Empires, Kyakhta gave its name to the so-called Kyakhta Russian–Chinese Pidgin, a contact language that was used by Russian and Chinese traders to communicate.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Kyakhta serves as the administrative center of Kyakhtinsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with one rural locality (the settlement of Sudzha), incorporated within Kyakhtinsky District as the Town of Kyakhta. As a municipal division, the Town of Kyakhta is incorporated within Kyakhtinsky Municipal District as Kyakhta Urban Settlement.\n\nKyakhta's economy today relies mainly on its status as an important center for trade between Russia, China, and Mongolia, located on the highway from the republic's capital of Ulan-Ude to the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator. It also has textile, lumber, and food-processing plants.\n\nKyakhta is home to the Damdin Sükhbaatar memorial museum.\n\nKyakhta has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification \"Dwb\") with dry, severely cold winters and warm, moist summers.\n\nIn Mongolian, Kyakhta was formerly known as (\"Ar Khiagt\", lit. \"North Kyakhta\"); Altanbulag (then, Maimaicheng) across the border was (\"Övör Khiagt\", lit. \"South Kyakhta\"). When the town was known as Troitskosavsk, its name in Mongolian was (\"Deed Šhivee\").\n\n"}

Gurney was assassinated by communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency, while serving as high commissioner in the Federation of Malaya.\n\nAs a boy, Gurney was educated at Winchester College. During World War I, he joined the British Army, and served with the King's Royal Rifle Corps from 1917 to 1920. After a brief spell at University College Oxford, he joined the British Colonial Service in 1921, and was posted to Kenya as an assistant district commissioner. In 1935, after fourteen years in Kenya, he was appointed Assistant Colonial Secretary to Jamaica. After a brief stint working at the Colonial Office in London, Gurney served as Chief Secretary to the Conference of East Africa Governors from 1938 to 1944, and Colonial Secretary in the Gold Coast from 1944 to 1946. In 1946, he was appointed Chief Secretary to Palestine, serving until the end of British rule there in 1948. While serving in Palestine, Gurney was instrumental in crafting British policy during the Jewish insurgency in Palestine.\n\nIn the 1947 New Year Honours, he was promoted to Knight Commander () of the Order of St Michael and St George, which is the second highest rank in this order – for his service in Palestine. He had previously been a Companion (CMG) in the same order. In 1949 he was made a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John.\n\nOn 1 October 1948, Gurney was appointed High Commissioner to Malaya. Gurney assumed his post as the Malayan Emergency was beginning, and over the next three years he became the chief architect of British policy in Malaya.\n\nOn 6 October 1951, Gurney was killed in an ambush by communist insurgents from the Malayan Communist Party while on his way to a resort at Mile 56 ½, Kuala Kubu Road near Fraser's Hill. According to Communist leader Chin Peng, the ambush was routine, the killing by chance, and the guerrillas only learned the High Commissioner was among the dead from news reports.\n\nGurney's funeral took place on 8 October. He was buried in Cheras War Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur, in a ceremony that drew thousands of people.\n\nAlthough Gurney was knighted by King George VI, Malayans from all classes and nationalities, having already given him their esteem and affection, kept his memory green, and when he died on 6 October 1951 they would mourn him as a friend who \"has gone home to the mercy of God\". At that moment, his funeral was not only attended by his family members and British Officers in Malaya but also attended by the Malayans from all classes and races. Today, Gurney Road in Malacca, Seremban, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore are named after him. The town named Pekan Gurney in Perak is also named after him. The popular beachfront Gurney Drive, in Penang, is also named after him, as well as the Henry Gurney Prisoners School in Teluk Mas, Melaka. Gurney was buried at Cheras War Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nHis tombstone (shown on the right) is inscribed:\n"}

He was previously a Foreign Office and Home Office Minister.\n\nIn September 2015 Browne was appointed as a \"Special Representative for the City of London Corporation\" in the European Union, as part of the City's efforts to boost its presence in Brussels.\n\nBorn in Islington, Browne is the son of British diplomat Sir Nicholas Browne, and, as a child, lived in many different countries, including Iran, Zimbabwe, and Belgium.\n\nBrowne was educated at Bedales School, and the University of Nottingham where he studied politics. He became Editor of the University Newspaper and was elected President of the Students' Union in 1992.\n\nBrowne became a researcher for the Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith in 1993. He worked for financial-consultancy Dewe Rogerson and has also worked for a public relations firms Edelman and Reputationinc. He worked for the Liberal Democrats nationally and rose to be their Director of Press and Broadcasting under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy.\n\nBrowne was chosen by his Enfield local party branch to contest Enfield Southgate parliamentary constituency at the 1997 general election and followed the previous result for the party in achieving third position, behind Labour's Stephen Twigg who on that date ousted the Secretary of State for Defence, Michael Portillo in one of the most surprising landslide results.\n\nShortly after the 2001 general election Browne was chosen to contest the more winnable marginal seat of Taunton which had been gained by the Conservative Adrian Flook from the Liberal Democrat Jackie Ballard by just 235 votes. The 2005 general election was again close in Taunton; however Browne beat the incumbent by 573 votes, against the national swing.\n\nFollowing his election in 2005, Browne was appointed a spokesman on Foreign Affairs and as Member of the Home Affairs Select Committee.\n\nDuring the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership campaign, Browne was campaign press secretary to Menzies Campbell. He was later promoted to the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team to become the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Home Affairs.\n\nDuring the 2007 leadership election, he was a supporter of Nick Clegg and a member of his campaign team. In 2008, Browne became Lib Dem Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nBrowne presented a private member's bill entitled the Organ Donation (Presumed Consent) Bill 2008–09. The Bill aimed to address the problem of a lack of organs available for transplant in the UK. Over 1000 people a year die whilst on waiting lists for organs.\n\nDuring the 2009 expenses scandal, Browne was initially asked to pay back £17,894 in mortgage payments by the Legg Report, after re-mortgaging his London home to provide a deposit for a constituency home. He appealed this decision, making him the first MP to do so, and argued that he was being penalised for using his own money instead of claiming a greater amount from the taxpayer. His appeal was successful, with Sir Paul Kennedy accepting that the arrangement cost the taxpayer less than the alternative options and saying that Browne had acted \"openly and honestly, and for the very purpose for which ACA was established\". In the final report, Browne was not required to repay anything.\n\nIn 2010 after some boundary changes, Browne defended his renamed seat, Taunton Deane, with an increased majority of 3,993.\n\nFollowing the 2010 general election as part of the new coalition government Browne was appointed Minister of State with the responsibility for South East Asia & Far East, Caribbean, Central & South America, Australasia & Pacific, human rights, consular, migration, drugs and international crime, public diplomacy and the Olympics at the Foreign Office. In the government reshuffle of September 2012 he was appointed Minister of State for crime prevention and drug policy in the Home Office. In the reshuffle of October 2013 he was returned to the back benches.\nBrowne confirmed that has been approached by senior Tories, such as Grant Shapps, in the hope he might be persuaded to defect to the Conservative Party. Interviewed about those who said he was in the wrong party, Browne said: \"I'd turn that on its head. I'd say my ambition for the Lib Dems is to attract the small 'l' liberals in the Conservative and Labour parties.\n\nBrowne was the UK Government representative at the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.\n\nOn 15 October 2014, Browne announced that he would stand down at the next general election.\n\nBrowne became a vice president of the charity Parkinson's UK in 2007. Browne is a supporter of Queens Park Rangers Football Club.\n\nBrowne is strongly associated with the \"\" wing of the Liberal Democrats. He is a classical liberal: a believer in free-market economics, free trade, low taxation, small government and individual empowerment. At the same time he is both culturally and socially liberal.\n\nIn 2014, following his years in the Foreign Office, he wrote a book called \"Race Plan: An authentic liberal plan to get Britain fit for \"The Global Race\"\". It details a warning to British political classes, of the urgent necessity, to get fit for the global race against the new powerhouses of Asia and Latin America. It has been described as a tightly argued plea for a more ambitious liberalism.\nBrowne writes: \"Britain must work with, rather than against, the forces of globalisation. We must champion our economic liberalism if we are to keep our markets open for business. In addition we need to rediscover the true meaning of social liberalism. The task today is to push power, money, information and choice down to the individual citizen, so that everyone can enjoy the opportunities that a fortunate few take for granted.\" Several of his proposed policy ideas received broad media attention, including calls for the top rate of tax to be returned to 40%, the introduction of portable school vouchers allowing parents to choose their child's school, allowing free schools to function for profit, reduction of the state to 35–38% of GDP, the removal of ring-fencing of public spending in areas including health, more patient choice and the creation of new sources of revenue including insurance payments, abolition of the Department for Energy and Climate Change, big increases in infrastructure spending on new housing, roads, high-speed rail and a new hub airport in the Thames Estuary, and reform of the House of Lords. Although Browne argued for continuing British membership of the European Union, he opposed the idea of \"ever closer union\" and also delivered more Eurosceptic messages in his book.\n\nJeremy Browne was nominated for the Stonewall Politician of the Year Award in 2011 for his work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people.\nHe was given a score of 79% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall. On 5 February 2013 he voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on marriage equality in Britain.\n\n"}

Benirschke played for the San Diego Chargers as their placekicker from 1978 until 1986.\n\nFollowing his retirement from football Benirschke tried to find a career in television and was hired by Merv Griffin to replace Pat Sajak as host of the daytime game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" in 1989.\n\nBenirschke grew up in San Diego and attended La Jolla High School. His father Kurt Benirschke, a German immigrant, was a pathologist at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and the founder/director of the Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species at the San Diego Zoo, where Rolf worked summers in high school and college.\n\nRolf Benirschke majored in zoology at the University of California, Davis, where he played football under coach Jim Sochor. He was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the 12th round of the 1977 NFL Draft, and was then traded to the San Diego Chargers for his rookie year in the National Football League.\n\nIn the off-season before the 1978 season, his second season, he developed chronic fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. He learned that he had ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nHis health problems got worse in the 1979 season, when, on the team plane coming home from a road trip, Benirschke collapsed. He underwent two surgeries to remove his large intestine and he was in the intensive care unit for weeks. When released from the hospital, he weighed only 123 pounds and had to adjust to life with two ostomy appliances. His ileostomy was eventually reversed in a Kock pouch procedure.\n\nOn Sunday, November 18, 1979, Benirschke made his dramatic return to the Chargers in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. While he did not play, he was named honorary team captain for the game, which was a sellout. Louie Kelcher, a Chargers' defensive tackle, assisted him and held his hand out onto the field. The Chargers won the game 35-7.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1982, Benirschke was also a broadcaster for the San Diego Sockers of the former North American Soccer League.\n\nIn 1980 Benirschke returned to kicking and played seven more seasons with the team before retiring in 1987 as the team's all-time leader in points scored (766).\n\nHe was named the NFL Man of the Year in 1983. He was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 1983 season. In 1984, his kickoffs were viewed to be too short, and he gave a thumbs-up sign to Denver Broncos kicker Rich Karlis before a field goal that defeated the Chargers, prompting a meeting with San Diego owner Alex Spanos over Benirschke's loyalties. Although Benirschke had the third-highest field goal percentage in NFL history, the Chargers selected punter/kicker Ralf Mojsiejenko in the 1985 NFL Draft to provide competition.\n\nOn August 31, 1987, Benirschke was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a draft pick after he lost his job to rookie Vince Abbott. He was released by Dallas on September 7, and formally announced his retirement in December. After 10 years with San Diego, he retired as the team's all-time scoring leader with 766 points and held 15 club records. He made 146 field goals in 208 tries for a .702 field goal percentage, at the time the third-most accurate in league history behind Eddie Murray and Nick Lowery.\n\nIn 1997, he was the twentieth player inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame.\n\nBenirschke hosted the daytime version of the TV game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" from January 10 to June 30, 1989 after Pat Sajak left the daytime version to host \"The Pat Sajak Show\"; Sajak has continued to host the nighttime syndicated version. When the daytime version moved to CBS, Bob Goen succeeded Benirschke as host. He has not been involved in television since, but was among the many participants in the E!

{"id": "1847922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847922", "title": "Commission on Elections (Philippines)", "text": "Commission on Elections (Philippines)\n\nThe Commission on Elections (), usually abbreviated as , is one of the three constitutional commissions of the Philippines. Its principal role is to enforce all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of elections in the Philippines.\n\nAccording to Article IX-C, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, the Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:\n\nThe Commission on Elections () was created by a 1940 amendment to the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines. Before the creation of the , supervision over the conduct of elections was vested by law in the Executive Bureau under the Department of Interior and, later directly by the same Department. The Secretary of Interior saw to it that local authorities performed the ministerial duties assigned to them by the Election Code. He decides administrative questions concerning elections. The courts, however, exercised exclusive and final jurisdiction over questions affecting the right to vote as well as contested elections of local elective officials. Elections contests involving members of the National Assembly were judged solely by an Electoral Commission composed of three justices of the Supreme Court and six members of the National Assembly.\n\nIn view, however, of the close official ties between the President and the Secretary of Interior, there was always the danger of a partisan Secretary of the Interior exploiting his powers and influence to ensure the victory of his party at the polls. As a consequence, the Constitution was amended in 1940 to create an independent Commission on Elections, composed of a Chairman and two other members, to take over the functions of the Secretary of the Interior relative to the elections. but since the amendments could not be effective in time for the 1940 elections, the National Assembly, by Commonwealth Act No. 607, created a Commission on Elections, giving thereto the same powers which the Commission on Elections could have under the amended Constitution. The statutory Commission supervised the conduct of the December 10, 1940 local elections.\n\nThe constitutional amendment creating the Commission on Elections was finally approved on December 2, 1940. On June 21, 1941, Commonwealth Act No. 657 was enacted reorganizing the Commission on Elections as a constitutional entity. The members of the statutory Commission continued as members of the constitutional Commission.\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the Commission had a fixed term of nine years each – a member being replaced every three years except in the first Commission. They could be removed from office only by impeachment. They were provided with fixed salaries which could neither be increased nor diminished during their term of office. These were safeguards to ensure the independence of the Commission.\n\nThe administrative control of elections exercised by the Secretary of Interior was transferred to the Commission on Elections. The Commission was vested with the exclusive charge of enforcing and administering all laws relative to elections and power to decide all questions affecting elections, except those involving the right to vote, which were left to final judicial determination. The courts and electoral tribunals retained their original powers over election contests.\n\nThe 1973 Constitution enlarged the membership of the Commission from three to nine members but reduced their term of office from nine years to seven years. As in the 1935 Constitution, the Chairman and Commissioners have staggered terms of office and could be removed from office only by impeachment.\n\nFirst to serve in the Commission on Elections under the 1973 Constitution were former Senator Leonardo B. Perez, as Chairman, and Venacio S. Duque, Flores A. Bayot, Jose M. Mendoza, Fernando R. Veloso, Lininding Pangandaman, Venancio L. Yaneza and Casimiro R. Madarang, Jr. as Commissioners. Commissioner Pangandaman, the first Muslim Commissioner of the , was appointed Ambassador by President Ferdinand Marcos even before the expiration of his term. His unexpired term was taken over by Commissioner Hashim R. Abubakar.\n\nOn May 17, 1980, Chairman Perez (who was later appointed Minister on Political Affairs by President Marcos) and Commissioners Duque and Bayot, after completing their seven-years term, retired. Commissioner Santiago succeeded Perez, and the following were appointed Commissioners: Domingo C. Pabalete; Victorino A. Savellano; Jaime C. Opinion; Noli Sagadraca; Romeo Firme: Luis Lardizabal and Ide C. Tillah. With Commissioner Lardizabal the membership of the Commission was thus increased to eight, one short of the full complement of nine.\n\nUpon the retirement of Commissioners Firme, Tillah and Lardizabal on May 17, 1983 the Commission on Elections was composed of only five members. On March 21, 1983, two new members were appointed by President Marcos, namely: Froilan Bacungan and Ramon H. Felipe, Jr. With the retirement of Chairman Santiago and Commissioners Pabalete and Sagadraca on May 17, 1984, Savellano was appointed Chairman. Three new members were appointed on July 27, 1985, namely: Commissioners Quirino A. Marquinez, Mangontawar Guro and Mario D. Ortiz. On January 31, 1986 Commissioners Ruben C. Agpalo and Jaime Layosa were appointed to finally complete the required membership of nine.\n\nAfter the tumultuous February 7, 1986 snap elections and the People Power Revolution, Chairman Savellano and all the Commissioners of the tendered their courtesy resignations which, except those of Commissioners Bacungan and Felipe, were accepted by President Corazon C. Aquino.\n\nOn April 11, 1986 Commissioner Felipe was appointed Acting Chairman. On July 23, 1986 he took his oath of office as permanent Chairman, together with Commissioners Leopoldo Africa, Haydee Yorac, Andres Flores, Anacleto Badoy, and Dario Rama as members of the \"new\" Commission on Elections. On February 15, 1988 Hilario G. Davide, Jr., was appointed Chairman with Alfredo E. Abueg, Jr., Haydee B. Yorac, Leopoldo L. Africa, Andres R. Flores, Dario C. Rama and Magdara B. Dimaampao as Commissioners. Commissioner Haydee B. Yorac was appointed as Acting Chairman when Hilario G. Davide, Jr. was appointed Chairman of the Presidential Fact Finding Commission in December 1989, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 146. On June 6, 1991 Christian Monsod was appointed by President Aquino as Chairman of the Commission to serve the unexpired term of Davide.\n\nWhen Monsod retired on February 15, 1995 President Fidel V. Ramos appointed Court of Appeals Justice Bernardo Pardo as Chairman of the Commission. Pardo's term was cut short when he was appointed by President Joseph Estrada as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in October 1998. Commissioner Luzviminda Tancangco was appointed Acting Chairman of the Commission.\n\nOn January 11, 1999 President Estrada appointed Sandiganbayan Justice Harriet Demetriou as Chairman of the Commission. After the events of January 17 to 20, 2001 that led to the ouster and resignation of President Estrada from power, Demetriou tendered her courtesy resignation which was accepted by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nOn February 19, 2001 President Arroyo appointed Justice Alfredo Benipayo as Chairman of the Commission. However, the Commission on Appointments did not confirm his appointment due to opposition of some Commissioners led by Luzviminda Tancangco. On June 5, 2002 President Arroyo appointed Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman and former Mandaluyong City mayor Benjamin S. Abalos, Sr. to replace Benipayo. On January 26, 2008, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appointed former Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo, 77, to replace Chair Abalos. The United Opposition (Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino) opposed Melo's appointment. But Melo needs to be confirmed by the Commission on Appointments (CA), so Commissioner Romeo A. Brawner was appointed ad interim Acting Chairman on February 2, 2008 and will stay as Chairman until Melo is confirmed by the CA. On March 25, 2008, former Supreme Court justice Jose Melo was sworn in as new chairman of the Commission on Elections () by acting Chair Romeo A. Brawner. Melo's ad interim appointment (Congress is not in session) was sent by the Malacañan to the Commission on Appointments.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, Romeo A. Brawner died from a massive heart attack. Brawner, appointed to the to replace the controversial Virgilio Garcillano, was supposed to end his term on February 2, 2011. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, on July 2, 2008, appointed former Acting Judge (Br. 74, RTC, Malabon) Leonardo Leonida and retired Justice of the Court of Appeals Lucenito Tagle as Commissioners of the Commission on Elections. On November 7, 2008, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has appointed Armando Velasco, as new election commissioner, and reappointed bypassed Commissioners Leonardo L. Leonida and Lucenito N. Tagle. Eduardo Ermita stated \"Velasco replaced commissioner and former Iligan City Judge Moslemen Macarambon, Jr. whose appointment had been bypassed several times by the Commission on Appointments (CA).\"\n\nOn September 27, 2007, Iloilo Vice Governor Rolex Suplico filed a 69-page impeachment complaint (3:00 p.m.) against Commission on Elections chairman Benjamin Abalos, Sr. before the House of Representatives of the Philippines regarding the ZTE national broadband network (NBN) deal. It was endorsed by Representatives Teofisto Guingona III of Bukidnon and Teodoro Casiño of Bayan Muna (People First), and Zamboanga City Representative Ma. Isabelle Climaco. Affidavits of Romulo Neri and Jose de Venecia III supported the complaint. On October 1, 2007, Chairman Benjamin Abalos, Sr. faced with an impending impeachment case resigned in a press conference. The Commission on Elections appointed Resurreccion Z. Borra as Acting Chairman. Mr. Abalos stated: \"\"I'm resigning... effective immediately,\" Mr. Abalos told a news conference. \"However, let not my detractors feast on this declaration. I'm not admitting guilt for any wrongdoing\".\" An impeachment complaint against Commission on Elections () chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr was formally filed before the House of Representatives after Romulo Neri, former chief of the National Economic Development Authority (Neda), accused Abalos of attempting to bribe him.\n\nThe Commission proper is the policy-making body composed of the Chairman and six Commissioners who must be natural-born citizens of the Philippines; at least thirty-five years of age at the time of their appointment; holders of a college degree, with a majority of them, including the Chairman, members of the Philippine Bar who have been engaged in the practice of law for at least ten years; and must not have been a candidate for any elective position in the immediate preceding elections. The Chairman and the Commissioners are appointed by the President, with the consent of the Commission on Appointments and hold office for seven years, without reappointment. The Chairman acts as the Presiding Officer and Chief Executive Officer of the Commission. Assisting the Commission are an executive director and deputies, 17 Regional Election Directors, Provincial Election Supervisors and Election Officers in cities and municipalities. has more than 15,000 employees.\n\nThe Commissioners exercise quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions either \"en banc\" or in division. They also perform such other functions as may be assigned by the Commission or the Chairman.\n\nIn August 2007, Nueva Vizcaya Rep. Carlos Padilla delivered a privilege speech alleging that Abalos brokered for the national broadband network (NBN) project. Padilla claimed that Abalos met with officials of the Chinese firm ZTE Corp., which got the US $329 million contract for the broadband project.\n\nAbalos denied brokering for the National Broadband Network project despite admitting he knows some officials in ZTE Corp. He admitted making four trips to China and playing golf there. He also admitted that ZTE officials, whom he says are his golf buddies, hosted and paid for the trips.\n\nJose de Venecia III, son of House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr, alleged that Abalos offered him US$10 million to withdraw his proposal on the NBN project. De Venecia is a majority shareholder of Amsterdam Holdings Inc., a company that submitted an unsolicited proposal on the NBN project. De Venecia also claimed that Abalos asked for money from the ZTE Corp. officials.\n\nAbalos was mentioned in the \"Hello Garci\" tape, which refers to the alleged wiretapped conversations where vote rigging in the 2004 elections was discussed by, among others, a woman presumed to be President Arroyo and man presumed to be Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano.\n\nAbalos was the chair when the election body approved a P1.3-billion contract with the Mega Pacific Consortium for the purchase of automated counting machines, which the Supreme Court in January 2004 declared as void because of \"clear violation of law and jurisprudence\" and \"reckless disregard of 's own bidding rules and procedure.\"\n\nOn January 21, 2004, Pimentel filed criminal and administrative charges before the Ombudsman against Abalos and other commissioners in connection with the deal. Abalos described the charges as a \"demolition job.\"\n\nPimentel accused Abalos and the other commissioners of committing an act of impropriety when they and their wives traveled to Seoul, South Korea to visit the plant of the maker of the counting machines a few months before the bidding for the contract started. Pimentel said he received information that the Korean company paid for the plane tickets and hotel accommodations for the trip.\n\nHowever, Abalos claimed that the expenses for the trip were paid for out of the P1 million he won in a golf tournament in Wack Wack.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, the Ombudsman, in a resolution, absolved all respondents involved in the Mega Pacific controversy of all administrative and criminal liabilities \"for lack of probable cause.\" It also reversed its June 28 resolution which contained factual findings that can be used by the House of Representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings against Commissioner Resureccion Borra.\n\nJust six weeks before the 2016 Philippine general election, the website was hacked by a group called \"Anonymous Philippines\" on the night of March 27, 2016. Anonymous Philippines asked the poll body to implement security on Precinct Count Optical Scanners (PCOS) — automated voting machines. Another group calling itself \"LulzSec Pilipinas\", claimed to have hacked 's website, and posted its database on their Facebook account shortly after \"Anonymous Philippines\" compromised 's website. These exploits exposed voter data and the vulnerability of both voter registration data and the functionality of their website. LulzSec posts 3 mirror links on their Facebook account that can be downloaded. The incident was considered the biggest private leak data in the Philippine history and leaving millions of registered voters at risk.\n\nThe sensitive information — includes full name, complete address, and passport number — of at least 55–70 million Filipino registered voters have been leaked publicly on a website called \"wehaveyourdata\", which is allegedly created by hacker \"LulzSec Philippines\". Anyone who access this website can type their first, surname, and middle name of the compromised registered voters on the search bar provided and then the sensitive information will reveal. The website is now taken down by NBI on April 22. COMELEC spokersperson James Jimenez warned the public not to use that website as this could be the phishing site. On April 21, COMELEC apologizes for privacy attacks made by the hackers.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have been apprehended two suspected hackers within last two weeks of April 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also the founding president of Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan). He was termed the \"Architect of Modern Penang\".\n\nLim was born in 1919 in Penang. He attended school at the Penang Free School, where he was the King's Scholar in 1937. He later obtained a degree in medicine and surgery from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in 1944.\n\nIn 1951, he was appointed to the Penang Local Council and in 1955, was appointed a member of the Federal Legislature.\n\nIn the March 1958 Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) party elections, he challenged Tun Tan Cheng Lock and won the presidency with a majority of 22 votes.\n\nDuring the one-year period when the MCA was under Lim, the party came under tremendous pressure from within and outside. After his victory, he called an extraordinary general meeting to amend the Constitution to consolidate the power of the Central Committee. This was met with strong resistance by Tun Tan Siew Sin and his supporters. Although the proposal was passed with a single-vote majority, the move left the Party split.\n\nAt the same time, the MCA under Lim also had severe political differences with the then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. The crisis worsened on the eve of the 1959 general elections when Lim demanded 40 parliamentary seats and also wanted to make Chinese an official language. The Tunku increased the seats allocated to MCA from 28 to 31 but this was rejected and their relationship worsened.\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman rejected Lim's demands, prompting Lim to resign as president of MCA and he left for England for a vacation. Dr Cheah Toon Lock then became the Acting President of MCA. Lim returned to Malaya after a few years and formed a new party, the United Democratic Party, in 1962.\n\nHe was one of the founding members of the Opposition Party Gerakan before the 1969 General Election. The formation of the Gerakan party threw the Chinese Malaysian aggregate into a dilemma, weakened their political strength and above all, eroded the political representation of the MCA as the only party for the Chinese community. Gerakan joined the ruling Barisan Nasional after winning the Penang State Government in 1969.\n\nLim served as Chief Minister of Penang from 1969 to 1990. The iconic projects that emerged during Lim's rule included the 66-storey KOMTAR administrative tower and commercial complex, and the 13.5 km Penang Bridge. When it was topped-off, KOMTAR was for some time the tallest building in Asia, and the Penang Bridge one of the longest in the world. Lim is best known for overseeing the emergence of Penang's Free Trade Zone (FTZ) – later renamed Free Industrial Zone – which evolved into one of Asia's most powerful electronics hubs.\n\nIn the Malaysian General Elections of October 1990, a crisis occurred when Lim, serving as the chief minister, lost his state seat and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) had fewer seats than UMNO in the Penang State Assembly. A crisis was averted when Tun Dr Lim Keng Yaik, the then president of Gerakan, was able to convince the then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to allow an ethnic Chinese to continue on in the role of the Chief Minister.\n\nLim had retired from politics and was concentrating on business. He was at the time chairman and advisor for several large corporations. In 2007, Lim was named founding chancellor of Wawasan Open University.\n\nIn late October 2010, he was admitted to the Penang Hospital after suffering a stroke. He later died on Wednesday, 24 November 2010 at his home in Hillside, Tanjung Bungah at about 9 pm. On Thursday, 25 November 2010, he was given a state funeral. The Penang state flag was flown at half-mast from 25 to 28 November for 4 days as a mark of respect. His body was cremated at Batu Gantung Crematorium on Sunday, 28 November 2010.\n\n\nThe 17.84 km Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway (highway ) comprising Jelutong Expressway and Bayan Lepas Expressway was renamed after him on 7 December 2010.\n\nOther memorials included Bangunan Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu, a main headquarters of the Penang Development Corporation (PDC) located at Persiaran Mahsuri, Bayan Lepas.\n"}
{"id": "1847936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847936", "title": "Honi HaMe'agel", "text": "Honi HaMe'agel\n\nHoni HaMe'agel (חוני המעגל Khoni, Choni, or Ḥoni; lit. Honi the Circle-drawer) was a Jewish scholar of the 1st-century BC, prior to the age of the \"tannaim\", the scholars from whose teachings the Mishnah was derived.\n\nDuring the 1st century BC, a variety of religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in Judea. A number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of Elijah and Elisha, the ancient Jewish prophets. The Babylonian Talmud, and the Jerusalem Talmud both provide some examples of such Jewish miracle workers, including Honi.\n\nHis surname is derived from an incident in which, according to the Babylonian Talmud, his prayer for rain was miraculously answered. On one occasion, when God did not send rain well into the winter (in Israel, it rains mainly in the winter), Honi drew a circle in the dust, stood inside it, and informed God that he would not move until it rained. When it began to drizzle, Honi told God that he was not satisfied and expected more rain; it then began to pour. He explained that he wanted a calm rain, at which point the rain calmed to a normal rain.\n\nHe was almost put into \"herem\" (excommunication) for the above incident in which he showed \"dishonor\" to God. However, Shimon ben Shetach, the brother of Queen Shlomtzion, excused him, saying that he was Honi and had a special relationship with God.\n\nTwo variations of this story appear in the Talmud, in Taanit 19a and 23a.\n\nTwo variations of a story are recorded - in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds - in which Honi fell asleep for decades before awaking. The story provides a Jewish version on the theme of a person or persons (as the Seven Sleepers) sleeping for many decades and waking to find a changed world—a theme originating in the story of Epimenides—found in many divergent cultures and traditions, and in modern times associated especially with the Rip Van Winkle story.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud tells the following story, in which Honi slept for 70 years, before awaking and then dying: \n\nThe lesson that is taken away from this story is that if you give something you will not be alive to see, you are still giving. No matter what.\n\nIn the Jerusalem Talmud, the circle drawing story is notably missing, and the sleep theme does not manifest as the carob tree story. Instead, the story is about Honi sleeping in a cave for seventy years, then returning to the Temple, where he was able to prove his identity:\n\nUnlike the Babylonian Talmud story, the Jerusalem Talmud story does not describe Honi's death. This more closely resembles the Epimenides sleep story in which Epimenides is able to pass on his message. According to one source, this difference could be specifically because of the two pieces this story is based on: Honi's death in Josephus (described below), and the Epimenides sleep theme. The idea would be that in the Jerusalem Talmud's case, the author more closely followed the Epimenides story to get their point across, while in the Babylonian Talmud, the author had a more metaphorical approach to his death in Josephus.\n\nAccording to Josephus, in \"Antiquities of the Jews\", Honi met his end in the context of conflict between the Hasmonean brothers Hyrcanus II, backed by the Pharisees and advised by Antipater the Idumaean, and Aristobulus II, backed by the Sadducees. Around 63 BC, Honi was captured by the followers of Hyrcanus besieging Jerusalem and was asked to pray for the demise of their opponents. Honi, however, prayed: \"Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Your people, I beseech You not to answer the evil prayers of either.\" After this, the followers of Hyrcanus stoned him to death.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud records a different story of his death, as part of the aforementioned carob tree story. The Maharsha explains the discrepancy between the Talmud and Josephus by stating that Honi was \"presumed\" killed by Hyrcanus II's men, but in reality was put into a deep sleep or coma for 70 years, and only then died.\n\nHoni's grave is found near the town of Hatzor HaGlilit in northern Israel.\n\n"}

Following the birth of her two now fully grown boys, Jeremy and Ben, Tom decided that she wanted a girl and adopted her daughter Emily from South Korea. Following Emily's adoption, the social worker from her case again contacted Susan and enquired whether she would be able to take in a newborn, Margaret, suffering from failure to thrive and numerous other health conditions. According to Tom, it is at this point that she and her husband, Philip, began to drift apart. Eventually, the strain was too much and the couple separated. Over the next decade, Tom adopted 9 other children with special needs, who likely would not have found stable homes otherwise. In her own words, Tom explained the drastic expansion as follows, \"Well from three to four isn't that much of a jump and at that point what's five?

For those films, animators Frank Thomas and Marc Davis designed the characters' facial features and expressions to be closely similar to Audley. She was the live-action model for both characters. Audley had initially turned down the role of Maleficent because she was battling tuberculosis at the time.\n\nIn 1969, Audley's voice was used as the voice of Madame Leota, the spirit of a psychic medium, in the Haunted Mansion attractions in Disneyland and Walt Disney World.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1970, Audley appeared regularly on television, including: \"I Love Lucy\"; \"Crossroads\"; \"The People's Choice\"; \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\"; \"Perry Mason\"; \"Dennis the Menace\"; \"Hazel\"; \"Pete and Gladys\"; \"The Real McCoys\"; \"The Twilight Zone\"; \"Mr. Lucky\"; \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" (as Parent-Teacher Association head, Mrs. Billings); \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" (as Potts School headmistress, Millicent Schuyler-Potts); \"Mister Ed\" (as Aunt Martha); and \"My Three Sons\" (as mother-in-law, Mrs. Vincent, which was her final role before retiring).\n\nAudley had the role of Mrs. Tinsley on \"Pistols 'n' Petticoats\". She also played a recurring character on the CBS sitcom \"Green Acres\" from 1965–69, portraying Oliver Douglas's disapproving mother, Eunice Douglas, despite being only five months older than actor Eddie Albert who played her son. When the cast were reunited for a 1990 TV movie, \"Return to Green Acres\", Audley could not appear due to failing health.\n\nAudley died from respiratory failure on November 25, 1991. She is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n"}

The Labour Party, led by Tony Blair, won its third consecutive victory, with Blair becoming the only Labour leader beside Harold Wilson to form three majority governments. However, its majority fell to 66 seats compared to the 167-seat majority it had won four years before. This was the first time the Labour Party had won a third consecutive election. As of 2020, it remains the last general election victory for the Labour Party and was also the last general election until 2019 that a single political party would manage to achieve a large overall majority over all other parties.\n\nThe Labour campaign emphasised a strong economy; however, Blair had suffered a decline in popularity, which was exacerbated by the decision to send British troops to invade Iraq in 2003. Despite this, Labour mostly retained its leads over the Conservatives in opinion polls on economic competence and leadership, and Conservative leaders Iain Duncan Smith (2001–2003) and Michael Howard (2003–2005) struggled to capitalise on Blair's unpopularity, with the party consistently trailing behind Labour in the polls throughout the 2001–2005 parliament. \n\nThe Conservatives campaigned on policies such as immigration limits, improving poorly managed hospitals, and reducing high crime rates, all under the slogan \"Are you thinking what we're thinking?\". The Liberal Democrats, led by Charles Kennedy, were opposed to the Iraq War, given that there had been no second UN resolution, and collected votes from disenchanted Labour voters. \n\nTony Blair was returned as Prime Minister, with Labour having 355 MPs, but with a popular vote share of 35.2%, the smallest of any majority government in UK electoral history. In terms of votes, it was only narrowly ahead of the Conservatives, but still had a comfortable lead in terms of seats. The Conservatives returned 198 MPs, with 32 more seats than they had won at the previous general election, and won the popular vote in England, while still ending up with 91 fewer MPs in England than Labour. The Liberal Democrats saw their popular vote increase by 3.7% and won the most seats of any third party since 1923, with 62 MPs. Anti-war activist and former Labour MP George Galloway was elected as the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow under the Respect – The Unity Coalition banner; Richard Taylor was re-elected for Kidderminster Health Concern in Wyre Forest; and independent candidate Peter Law was elected in Blaenau Gwent.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party, the more moderate of the main unionist parties, which had dominated Northern Irish politics since the 1920s, was reduced from six MPs to one, with party leader David Trimble himself being unseated. The more hardline Democratic Unionist Party became the largest Northern Irish party, with nine MPs elected. Notable MPs leaving the House of Commons at this election included UUP leader David Trimble, former SDLP leader John Hume, former Cabinet ministers Estelle Morris, Paul Boateng, Chris Smith, Gillian Shephard, Virginia Bottomley and Michael Portillo, the Father of the House of Commons Tam Dalyell, Tony Banks and Sir Teddy Taylor.\n\nFollowing the election, Michael Howard resigned as Conservative leader and was succeeded by future Prime Minister David Cameron. Blair resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party in June 2007, and was replaced by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. The election results were broadcast live on the BBC and presented by Peter Snow, David Dimbleby, Tony King, Jeremy Paxman, and Andrew Marr.\n\nThe governing Labour Party, led by Tony Blair, was looking to secure a third consecutive term in office and to retain a large majority. The Conservative Party was seeking to regain seats lost to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats since the 1992 general election, and move from being the Official Opposition into government. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both main parties, but especially the Conservative Party, with a \"decapitation\" strategy targeting members of the Shadow Cabinet. The Lib Dems had also wished to become the governing party, or to make enough gains to become the Official Opposition, but more realistically hoped to play a major part in a parliament led by a minority Labour or Conservative government. In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist Party sought to make further gains from the Ulster Unionist Party in unionist politics, and Sinn Féin hoped to overtake the Social Democratic and Labour Party in nationalist politics. (Note that Sinn Féin MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons—they refuse to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen as required.) The pro-independence Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) stood candidates in every constituency in Scotland and Wales respectively.\n\nMany seats were contested by other parties, including several parties without incumbents in the House of Commons. Parties that were not represented at Westminster, but had seats in the devolved assemblies and/or the European Parliament, included the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the UK Independence Party, the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party, and the Scottish Socialist Party. The Health Concern party also stood again. A full list of parties which declared their intention to run can be found on the list of parties contesting the 2005 general election.\n\nAll parties campaigned using such tools as party manifestos, party political broadcasts and touring the country in what are commonly referred to as battle buses.\n\nLocal elections in parts of England and in Northern Ireland were held on the same day. The polls were open for fifteen hours, from 07:00 to 22:00 BST (UTC+1). The election came just over three weeks after the dissolution of Parliament on 11 April by Queen Elizabeth II, at the request of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\n\nFollowing the death of Pope John Paul II on 2 April, it was announced that the calling of the election would be delayed until 5 April.\n\nThanks to eight years of sustained economic growth Labour could point to a strong economy, with greater investment in public services such as education and health. This was overshadowed, however, by the issue of the controversial 2003 invasion of Iraq, which met widespread public criticism at the time, and would dog Blair throughout the campaign. The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, played a prominent role in the election campaign, frequently appearing with Blair and ensuring that the economy would remain the central focus of Labour's message.\n\nRecently elected Conservative leader Michael Howard brought a great level of experience and stability to a party that had ousted its former leader Iain Duncan Smith just 18 months prior. The Conservatives focused their campaign on more traditional conservative issues like immigration, which created some controversy with the slogan \"It's not racist to impose limits on immigration\". They also criticised Labour's \"dirty\" hospitals and high crime levels, under the umbrella of the slogan \"Are you thinking what we're thinking?\"\n\nHowever, Labour counter-attacked, by emphasising Howard's role in the unpopular Major Government of 1992–1997, airing a party election broadcast attacking Howard, showing a montage of scenes from Howard's tenure as Home Secretary, including prison riots and home repossessions. It also launched a billboard campaign showing Howard, and the Conservative Party's four previous leaders (Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague, John Major and Margaret Thatcher), with the caption \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again.\"\n\nFor the Liberal Democrats, this was the second and final election campaign fought by leader Charles Kennedy, who strongly opposed the Iraq War and personally offered a more down-to-earth approach to voters, which proved popular. There were some questions, however, over Kennedy's abilities when, at the Liberal Democrat manifesto launch, he was asked about local income tax, but appeared confused on the figures. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives were keen to tackle Labour's introduction of tuition fees, which both opposition parties opposed and promised to abolish.\n\nAt the close of voting (2200 BST) the ballot boxes were sealed and returned to the counting centres, where counting proceeded under the supervision of the returning officer who was obliged to declare the result as soon as it was known. As previously, there was serious competition amongst constituencies to be first to declare. Sunderland South repeated its performance in the last three elections and declared Labour incumbent Chris Mullin re-elected as MP with a majority of 11,059 at approximately 2245 BST (failing by two minutes to beat its previous best, but making it eligible for entry into the Guinness Book of World Records as longest consecutive delivery of first results). The vote itself represented a swing (in a safe Labour seat, in a safe Labour region) of about 4% to the Conservatives and 4.5% to the Liberal Democrats, somewhat below the prediction of BBC/ITV exit polls published shortly after 2200 BST.\n\nSunderland North was the next to declare, followed by Houghton and Washington East, both of whose Labour MPs retained their seats but with reductions in the incumbent majorities of up to 9%. The first Scottish seat to declare was Rutherglen and Hamilton West — another safe Labour seat, also a Labour hold, but with the majority reduced by 4%. The first seat to change hands was Putney, where Labour's majority of 2,771 fell to a strong Conservative challenge, with a total swing of about 5,000 (6.2%). This was also the first seat to be declared for the Conservatives. The first Liberal Democrat seat to be declared was North East Fife, the constituency of Lib Dem deputy leader Sir Menzies Campbell which he had held since 1987.\n\nThe constituency of Crawley in West Sussex had the slimmest majority of any seat, with Labour's Laura Moffatt holding off the Conservatives' Henry Smith by 37 votes after three recounts.\n\nFollowing problems with exit polls in previous British elections, the BBC and ITV agreed for the first time to pool their respective data, using results from Mori and NOP. More than 20,000 people were interviewed for the poll at 120 polling stations across the country. The predictions were very accurate—initial projections saw Labour returned to power with a majority of 66 (down from 160), and the final result (including South Staffordshire, where the election was postponed due to the death of a candidate) was indeed a Labour majority of 66.\n\nThe projected shares of the vote in Great Britain were Labour 35% (down 6% on 2001), Conservatives 33% (up 1%), Liberal Democrats 22% (up 4%) and other parties 8% (up 1%). The Conservatives were expected to make the biggest gains, however — 44 seats according to the exit poll — with the Liberal Democrats expected to take as few as two. Whilst the Lib Dems' vote share predicted by the exit poll was accurate (22.6% compared to the actual 22.0%), they did better in some Lib Dem-Labour marginals than predicted on the basis of the national share of the vote, and achieved a net gain of 11 seats.\n\nThere were major boundary changes in Scotland, where the number of seats were reduced from 72 to 59. As a result of this each party lost some seats, and this notional election result below is based on the 2001 election results if they had been fought on these new 2005 boundaries.\n\nAt 04:28 BST, it was announced that Labour had won Corby, giving them 324 seats in the House of Commons out of those then declared and an overall majority, Labour's total reaching 355 seats out of the 646 House of Commons seats. Labour received 35.3% of the popular vote, equating to approximately 22% of the electorate on a 61.3% turnout, up from 59.4% turnout in 2001. Increased turnout was mostly attributed to the extension and promotion of the postal voting system, which has been criticised as being too insecure increasing the risk of electoral fraud.\n\nAs expected, voter disenchantment led to an increase of support for many opposition parties, and caused many eligible to vote, not to turn out. Labour achieved a third successive term in office for the first time in their history, though with reduction of the Labour majority from 167 to 67 (as it was before the declaration of South Staffordshire). As it became clear that Labour had won an overall majority, Michael Howard, the leader of the Conservative Party, announced his intention to retire from frontline politics. The final seat to declare was the delayed poll in South Staffordshire, at just after 1 a.m. on Friday 24 June.\n\nThe election was followed by further criticism of the UK electoral system. Calls for reform came particularly from Lib Dem supporters, citing that they received only just over 10% of the overall seats with 22.1% of the popular vote. The only parties to win a substantially higher percentage of seats than they achieved in votes were Labour, the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, and Health Concern, which ran only one candidate. The results of the election give a Gallagher index of dis-proportionality of 16.76.\n\nThe Labour Government claimed that being returned to office for a third term for the first time ever showed the public approval of Labour's governance and the continued unpopularity of the Conservatives. Nevertheless, Labour's vote declined to 35.3%, the lowest share of the popular vote to have formed a majority government in the history of the UK House of Commons. In many areas the collapse in the Labour vote resulted in a host of seats changing hands. Labour also failed to gain any new seats, almost unique in any election since 1945. As well as losing seats to the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, Labour also lost Blaenau Gwent, their safest seat in Wales, to Independent Peter Law, and Bethnal Green and Bow to Respect candidate George Galloway.\n\nThe Conservatives claimed that their increased number of seats showed disenchantment with the Labour government and was a precursor of a Conservative breakthrough at the next election. Following three consecutive elections of declining representation and then in 2001 a net gain of just one seat, 2005 was the first general election since their famous 1983 landslide victory where the number of Conservative seats increased appreciably, although the Conservatives' vote share increased only slightly and this election did mark the third successive general election in which the Conservatives polled below 35%. In some areas the Conservative vote actually fell. The Conservatives claimed to have won the general election in England, since they received more votes than Labour although Labour still won a majority of seats.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats claimed that their continued gradual increase in seats and percentage vote showed they were in a position to make further gains from both parties. They pointed in particular to the fact that they were now in second place in roughly one hundred and ninety constituencies and that having had net losses to Labour in the 1992 general election and having not taken a single seat off Labour in 1997, they had held their gains off Labour from the 2001 general election and had actually made further gains from them. The Liberals also managed to take three seats from the Conservatives, one notable victory being that of Tim Farron over Tim Collins in Westmorland and Lonsdale, through the use of a \"decapitation strategy\", which targeted senior Tories.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats increased their percentage of the vote by 3.7%, the Conservatives by 0.6%, and Labour's dropped by 5.4%.\n\nThe UK media interpreted the results as an indicator of a breakdown in trust in the government, and especially in Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMeanwhile, the Scottish National Party improved its position in Scotland, regaining the Western Isles and Dundee East from Labour, having lost both seats in 1987. In Wales Plaid Cymru failed to gain any seats and lost Ceredigion to the Liberal Democrats. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists were all but wiped out, only keeping North Down, with leader David Trimble losing his seat in Upper Bann. For the first time the DUP became the biggest party in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt was the first general election since 1929 in which no party received more than ten million votes. It was the most \"three-cornered\" election since 1923, though the Liberal Democrats failed to match the higher national votes of the SDP–Liberal Alliance in the 1980s either in absolute or percentage terms. The total combined vote for Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats proved to be the lowest main three-party vote since 1922.\n\nThe figure of 355 seats for Labour does not include the Speaker Michael Martin. \nSee also the list of parties standing in Northern Ireland.\n\nFollowing the election result, Labour remained in power and Tony Blair remained Prime Minister, reshuffling Cabinet and junior ministers over the following weekend, with formal announcements made on 9 May 2005. The most senior positions of Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary remained the same (Gordon Brown, Charles Clarke and Jack Straw respectively), but a few new faces were added. Most notably, David Blunkett returned to cabinet as the Work and Pensions Secretary, although he was forced to resign again due to another scandal before the end of the year that spawned a national press and opposition campaign for his dismissal. Patricia Hewitt became the new Health Secretary, Tessa Jowell remained as Culture Secretary, whilst Alan Johnson was promoted to Trade and Industry Secretary. Meanwhile, Ruth Kelly retained the Education job and Margaret Beckett stayed put at Environment.\n\nThe new Parliament met on 11 May for the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nOn 6 May, Michael Howard announced he would be standing down as leader of the Conservative Party, but not before a review of the leadership rules. The formal leadership election began in October, and was ultimately won by David Cameron. On 7 May, David Trimble resigned as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; Sir Reg Empey was elected as his successor at an Ulster Unionist Council meeting on 24 June.\n\nBlair's successor as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown visited Buckingham Palace on 6 April 2010 and asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April. The next election was held on 6 May 2010.\n\n\n"}

Brothers Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick, financed by their wealthy lumberman father Joseph Patrick founded it and operated franchises in Vancouver and Victoria, with Frank, one of the founders of the earlier Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) as president. The Victoria Cubs' Arena was destroyed by fire in 1929, after which the club continued for the season and disbanded. A replacement team was formed in Tacoma, Washington.\n\n\n\nFrom 1931 to 1936, no league called the PCHL existed, although teams from the first PCHL joined the Western Canada Hockey League or the North West Hockey League. In 1936, the Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver franchises of the North West Hockey League joined with an Oakland team to re-form the Pacific Coast Hockey League. The Oakland team relocated to Spokane in its first year. The Spokane team disbanded for the 1939-40 season, but reappeared the next year as the Spokane Bombers. \n\nThe league disbanded after the 1941 season, primarily as a result of World War II.\n\n\n1937: Portland Buckaroos<br>\n1938: Seattle Seahawks<br>\n1939: Portland Buckaroos<br>\n1940: Vancouver Lions<br>\n1941: Vancouver Lions<br>\n\nThe final incarnation of the league was managed by Hockey Hall of Fame member Al Leader, and grew out of combining teams from the Southern California Hockey League and the Northwest International Hockey League.

In 1948, however, the ten team league voted to turn pro, and was recognized as such by the NHL. \n\nBefore the start of the 1951-1952 season, the PCHL had dwindled to a six team league. The neighbouring Western Canada Senior Hockey League (WCSHL), which played minor senior hockey on the Canadian prairies, had also dwindled, to just three franchises.

{"id": "1847950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847950", "title": "Dan DeQuille", "text": "Dan DeQuille\n\nWilliam Wright (1829–1898), better known by the pen name Dan DeQuille or Dan De Quille, was an American author, journalist, and humorist. He was best known for his written accounts of the people, events, and silver mining operations on the Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Nevada, including his non-fiction book \"History of the Big Bonanza\" (American Publishing Company, 1876).\n\nDeQuille was on the staff of the (Virginia City) \"Territorial Enterprise\" for over thirty years, and his writings were also printed in other publications throughout the country and abroad. Highly regarded for his knowledge of silver mining techniques and his ability to explain them in simple terms, he was also appreciated for his humor, similar in style to that of his associate and friend Mark Twain, and of a type very popular in the United States at that time, now referred to as the Sagebrush School literary genre.\n\nWilliam Wright was born in Knox County, Ohio, in 1829, the oldest of nine children. In 1849 he moved west with his family to West Liberty, Iowa, where in 1853 he married Caroline Coleman. Their union produced five children, two of whom died in infancy.\n\nIn 1857, leaving his family behind, he traveled to California in search of gold. While living as a nomadic prospector in the Sierra foothills and Mono Lake region, he heard of the discovery of silver on the other side of the Sierras and ventured to Virginia City, Nevada in 1859.\n\nWith no success at prospecting there and in need of funds to send his wife and children in Iowa, Wright applied for regular employment in Virginia City at the \"(Territorial) Enterprise\", a newspaper that had recently relocated there from Carson City, Nevada. He was hired in 1862 and soon adopted the pen name Dan DeQuille.\n\nWilliam Wright was interested as a young adult in a career as a writer. After his move to Iowa he wrote and submitted manuscripts to popular magazines in the East Coast. While prospecting for gold in California he wrote articles on prospector mining that were published in California newspapers. Long letters to his family helped to develop his skills at humorous exaggeration and detailed description. Following his move to Virginia City, he wrote articles that were printed in San Francisco's \"The Golden Era\".\n\nSoon after he became known as Dan DeQuille at the \"Enterprise\", another unsuccessful miner named Sam Clemens was hired to work under him in August 1863. Clemens adopted the pen name Mark Twain. The two of them reported on local events and wrote columns for the newspaper. Under DeQuille's editorial supervision, Twain established his reputation as a humorous writer. Twain would later describe this period in his book \"Roughing It\". Twain left Virginia City in May 1864 and after brief stays in San Francisco and Hawaii he toured as a lecturer, which brought him back for visits to Virginia City and DeQuille in 1866 and 1868.\n\nIn 1874 mine operators John William Mackay, James Graham Fair, Sen. John P. Jones, and William Ralston decided that a book should be written about the history of the Comstock. They approached DeQuille as the preferred author and he accepted the task. His original intent was to write a small book which could be sold to overland train passengers and to continue expanding it with new information and additional sketches until it eventually became a volume which could be published for a broader audience.\n\nDeQuille set to work on the book, collecting data, illustrations, and sketches to be included. In March 1875 he sent a letter to Mark Twain, then residing in Hartford, Connecticut, to seek his advice on having the book published. Concurrently Twain had himself seen a need for such a book and, seeing DeQuille as the one to write it, wrote him a letter to that effect. In response to DeQuille's letter, Twain responded with a 19-page letter enthusiastically providing advice and an invitation for DeQuille to gather up all the material he might need and join him in Hartford where they could each work on their respective projects in close proximity and mutual support.\nUnder Twain's mentorship during the summer of 1875, DeQuille pieced together a sizable volume which contained a mixture of technical chapters on silver mining interspersed with lighter accounts of Nevada events and individuals, including the Northern Paiute group of Native Americans living in the vicinity. DeQuille and Twain believed the book would have wide appeal and sell well. Twain helped DeQuille negotiate a favorable contract with his own publisher and DeQuille returned to Virginia City late that summer. In October a fire destroyed much of the city and his account of this tragedy would become the last chapter of his book.\n\n\"A History of the Big Bonanza\" was published by the American Publishing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, in 1876. They also published \"A History of the Comstock Silver Lode Mines\", a smaller version as a paper-bound guide-book to be sold on overland trains. The main book was eagerly anticipated in Virginia City and sold well on the Pacific Coast, but sales in the East were disappointing. DeQuille did not achieve the financial independence he had anticipated and would continue in his position at the \"Enterprise\" for another seventeen years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1880s the major silver mining operations at the Comstock Lode were coming to an end and the population of Virginia City was rapidly declining. DeQuille remained a prolific writer, however, providing articles for publication on both coasts, contributing a portion to Myron Angel's \"History of Nevada\" (Thompson & West, 1881), and writing the article on Nevada for the 10th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" in 1884.\n\nIn 1893 the \"Enterprise\" ended publication. DeQuille remained in Virginia City for a few more years working as a correspondent for a newspaper in Utah and as a contributor to publications on both coasts. In the late 1890s he returned in poor health to West Liberty, Iowa where he resided with his daughter until his death on March 16, 1898.\n\nAs a journalist and author Dan DeQuille contributed significantly to Americans' understanding of the events in Nevada and the procurement of vast fortunes from the Comstock Lode in the late 19th century. As a humorist he also made a significant contribution the lore of the Wild West. During Virginia City's heyday, DeQuille was one of the most widely read journalists on the Pacific Coast because of his wit coupled with his ability to explain in non-technical terms the significance of events on the Comstock Lode.\n\nThe style of humor that flourished in the United States during the latter half of the 19th century was shared by DeQuille, Artemus Ward, Orpheus C. Kerr, Petroleum V. Nasby, Major Jack Downing, and most notably Mark Twain. It has since been theorized that America's hunger for this type of humor sprang from a sort of national psychic need from the aftermath of the American Civil War, the grief over the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, and the hardships of industrial pioneering in the West.\n\nHistorical interest in Virginia City's past has continued throughout the 20th century. The town has become a popular tourist attraction with one of its features being the building which housed the \"Enterprise\" and on display therein the desk once used by DeQuille, Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and other frontier journalists.\n\nIn 1946 publishing house Alfred A. Knopf announced that in conjunction with the upcoming California centenary, it would reprint a series of five books that were historically significant in portraying the early days of California statehood, but which were difficult to find. The first book on their list was DeQuille's \"History of the Big Bonanza\". Editor Oscar Lewis wrote a biography of DeQuille as the \"Introduction\" to \"The Big Bonanza\", published in 1947.\n\nIn 1950 DeQuille was represented in an anthology of Western Americana entitled \"Comstock Bonanza\", collected and edited by Duncan Emrich and published by Vanguard. More recently Richard A. Dwyer and Richard E. Lingenfelter published \"Dan De Quille, The Washoe Giant. A Biography and Anthology\", featuring the fullest collection of his journalism and a checklist of all his writings (University of Nevada Press, 1990). English professor Lawrence I. Berkove collected the best of DeQuille's works and published them in 1990 as \"The Fighting Horse of the Stanislaus: Stories and Essays\" (University of Iowa Press).\n\nIn 1994, DeQuille was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2005, DeQuille's \"The Big Bonanza\" was used as the basis for a new American opera entitled \"The Big Bonanza\", with music by Monica Houghton and libretto by Jon Christensen.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847951", "title": "Moon Tiger", "text": "Moon Tiger\n\nMoon Tiger is a 1987 novel by Penelope Lively which spans the time before, during and after World War II. The novel won the 1987 Booker Prize. It is written from multiple points of view and moves backward and forward through time. It begins as the story of a woman who, on her deathbed, decides to write a history of the world, and develops into a story of love, incest and the desire to be recognized as an independent free thinking woman of the time.\n\nClaudia Hampton, a 76-year-old English woman and a professional historian, is terminally ill and is spending her last remaining moments in and out of consciousness thinking of writing a history of the world with her life as a blueprint. Her first, primordial recollections are of a father that died in World War I, and of the summer of 1920, when she was 10 and competing with her 11-year-old brother Gordon for fossils.\n\nClaudia and Gordon are, at times throughout their lives, rivals, lovers, and best friends to each other. When the two are in their late teens they begin an incestuous relationship and find it hard to relate to almost any other person their own age. Soon, however, their college careers and other events allow both to open up to the outside world, and look outward for companionship.\n\nAt the outset of World War II, Gordon, a would-be economist, is sent to India, whereas Claudia sets aside her studies in history to become a war correspondent. Independent and enterprising, Claudia talks her way into a correspondent's post in Cairo, where she meets Tom Southern, a captain of an English armoured tank division, who sweeps her off her feet.\n\nTom and Claudia fall in love during several long weekends together while he is on leave from the front. But their future together is never to materialize: shortly after their time together, the English are called to defend Egypt from Erwin Rommel's offensive at the First Battle of El Alamein, and Tom is declared missing. Later on, Claudia receives news that he has been killed.\n\nShortly after Tom's death, Claudia finds out she is pregnant, and decides that she will have the child, even though she would have to raise it alone. It isn't to be: Claudia miscarries, and is never told whether the child she had carried was a boy or a girl. That uncertainty, along with her fear that Tom died a horrible and painful death, will haunt her for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter the War, Claudia and Gordon reunite, but the encounter is more friendly than passionate. Each of them has obviously been changed by the War, but they are both sparse on actual details during their conversations. Gordon marries a girl named Sylvia, whom Claudia finds insipid and boring. Claudia meanwhile met Jasper, a well connected young man with whom she goes on to have an on-and-off, rather stormy relationship, and one that Gordon openly disapproves of.\n\nIn 1948 Claudia finds herself pregnant again, this time by Jasper, and while she has no intention of marrying him, she decides to have the child, Lisa. While Claudia loves Lisa, she finds she has little patience and time to care for a child, and so Lisa ultimately ends up being raised by her maternal and paternal grandmothers, who share her custody and dictate her upbringing. Not surprisingly, Lisa grows up sullen and indifferent to Claudia, and marries a respectable (boring) man at a young age.\n\nAfter reading an article Claudia has written condemning the Soviet invasion, a Hungarian functionary who becomes implicated in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution contacts Claudia out of the blue. Knowing that he will soon be imprisoned, the functionary decides to ask Claudia to make sure that his son Laszlo, who is in England at art college, does not attempt to return to Hungary. Claudia becomes a sort of surrogate mother to Laszlo, whom she grows to love and admire over the years, recognizing that he is drastically different from anyone else she knows: an open, painfully honest, sensitive, self-destructive artist.\n\nClaudia writes several popular history books, earning accolades from the public and occasional scorn from academic historians. She also briefly becomes a consultant for a movie based on her history of the Spanish invasion of Mexico, which leads to a personal scandal when she is in a car accident with the star of the movie, and the press suspects there is more to the relationship than just friendship. The event earns scorn from Jasper, who refuses to see her when she is in the hospital. Gordon, on the other hand, visits her to let her know that she is not alone.\n\nLater in life, Claudia decides to travel to Egypt alone but finds it much changed. Yet the desert brings back powerful memories of her intense love for Tom Southern and enduring pain at his death, a pain she is still unable to share with anyone else even after all the years that have passed.\n\nShortly thereafter, Gordon dies, and leaves a gaping void in Claudia's life. A few years later, when she is diagnosed with cancer, and knowing her own death is imminent, she apologizes to Lisa for having been a cold and distant mother. Lisa accepts the apology, but is not sure how to feel about it: it is the most unlikely thing Claudia (who to Lisa seemed to revel in being an almost omnipotent figure) has ever done for Lisa.\n\nLong after the War, Tom's sister Jennifer reads an article Claudia wrote about her experiences in Egypt, realizes she is the \"C.\" Tom had often referred to in letters home, and mails Claudia his wartime diary. Soon before she dies, Claudia asks Laszlo to fetch Tom's diary for her. Reading over the short entries in Tom's diary, many of which refer to his love for her, Claudia allows herself to reflect on her grief for Tom, her sorrow at having been left behind, and the course her life might have taken had he survived. She comes to peace with the fact that she too will soon become a set of imperfect memories of those who knew her. The next day, Claudia dies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847958", "title": "Zang Tumb Tumb", "text": "Zang Tumb Tumb\n\nZang Tumb Tumb (usually referred to as \"Zang Tumb Tuuum\") is a sound poem and concrete poem written by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an Italian futurist. It appeared in excerpts in journals between 1912 and 1914, when it was published as an artist's book in Milan. It is an account of the Battle of Adrianople, which he witnessed as a reporter for \"L'Intransigeant\". The poem uses \"Parole in libertà\" (words in freedom; creative typography) and other poetic impressions of the events of the battle, including the sounds of gunfire and explosions. The work is now seen as a seminal work of modernist art, and an enormous influence on the emerging culture of European avant-garde print. \n\n\"[The] masterpiece of Words-in-freedom and of Marinetti’s literary career was the novel \"Zang Tumb Tuuum\"... the story of the siege by the Bulgarians of Turkish Adrianople in the Balkan War, which Marinetti had witnessed as a war reporter. The dynamic rhythms and onomatopoetic possibilities that the new form offered were made even more effective through the revolutionary use of different typefaces, forms and graphic arrangements and sizes that became a distinctive part of Futurism. In \"Zang Tumb Tuuum\"; they are used to express an extraordinary range of different moods and speeds, quite apart from the noise and chaos of battle... Audiences in London, Berlin and Rome alike were bowled over by the tongue-twisting vitality with which Marinetti declaimed \"Zang Tumb Tuuum\". As an extended sound poem it stands as one of the monuments of experimental literature, its telegraphic barrage of nouns, colours, exclamations and directions pouring out in the screeching of trains, the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire, and the clatter of telegraphic messages\" Caroline Tisdall and Angelo Bozzola\n\nAccording to Marinetti, futurism was born as a direct consequence of a 1908 car crash in which, attempting to avoid two cyclists, he crashed his Fiat and went flying head over heels into a ditch. The experience led directly to the first futurist manifesto, which achieved an extraordinary coup-de-theâtre when he persuaded the editor of \"Le Figaro\" to publish the entire manifesto on the front page, February 20, 1909. Amongst a series of exhortations to replace the 'pensive, immobile' traditional literature with 'exalt[ed] movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness ... the slap and the blow with the fist.' and 'want[ing] to glorify war – the only cure for the world', the piece includes the famous quote:\n\nWe declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed ... a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. \nIn a slightly later manifesto, contemporaneous with \"Zang Tumb Tuuum\", Marinetti sets out a vision of modern book design which would provide the template for what would become known as the artist's book, in direct contrast to the French tradition of \"Livre d'Artiste\".\n\nI call for a typographic revolution directed against the idiotic and nauseating concepts of the outdated and conventional book, with its handmade paper and seventeenth century ornamentation of garlands and goddesses, huge initials and mythological vegetation, its missal ribbons and epigraphs and roman numerals. The book must be the Futurist expression of our futurist ideasm ... even more: My revolution is directed against what is known as the typographic harmony of the page, which is contrary to the flux and movement of style. Marinetti, \"Typographic Revolution\", 1913\n\nLatter-day admirers of Marinetti tend to see him as an iconoclastic and subversive anti-hero in revolt against an oppressive society. This considerably plays down Marinetti's role in the founding of Italian Fascism. Marinetti founded the Italian Fascist Party of Italy, and co-wrote the first Fascist manifesto. \"The Doctrine of Fascism\" (the party's final manifesto) features considerable amount of (uncredited)block quotations from The Founding Manifesto of Futurism. He organised a punch-up between futurists in Milan, September 1914, to support Italy's entry into the war, and in a similar demonstration in May 1915 both he and Benito Mussolini were arrested. The same year Marinetti published the futurist compilation \"Guerra sola igiene del mondo\" (War the only world hygiene, 1915) -a polemic to encourage Italy to enter World War I.\n\nThe book is a 228-page softback which includes foldout pages as part of the poem. The poem opens with \"Corrections of Proofs & Desires\" ;\n\n'No poetry before us\nwith our wireless imagination\nand words in freedom LOOOng live\nFuturism finally finally finally finally finally finally finally\nPoetry being BORN\n\nand ends with \"Bombardment\";\n\n'1 2 3 4 5 seconds siege guns split the silence in unison tam-tuuumb sudden echoes all the echoes seize it quick smash it scatter it to the infinite winds to the devil\n'In the middle these tam-tuuumb flattened 50 square kilometers leap 2-6-8 crashes clubs punches bashes quick-firing batteries.

The book originally cost 3 lire.\n\nMarinetti promoted his ideas by continually travelling across Europe giving recitations; as well as giving 'riotous soirées' throughout Italy, he travelled to Russia in 1910 and 1913, Paris 1912 and 1914, Berlin and Brussels in 1912, and London in 1911, 1912 and 1914. This last recital, on June 12, 1914, became notorious when, during a performance of \"The Battle Of Adrianople\" with CRW Nevinson on drums, a group of disgruntled vorticists, including Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Jacob Epstein interrupted the performance, jeering and shouting to protest at Marinetti's co-opting of vorticists' signatures to an English translation of the Futurist Manifesto. On another occasion at the Lyceum Club, 1911, Marinetti challenged an Irish journalist to a duel after a perceived slight against the Italian Army. Largely as a result of these tours, and the ease in which his publications including \"Zang Tumb Tumb\" could be distributed and disseminated, Futurism was better known than Cubism before World War I, and in England at least had become a synonym by the English Press to simply mean any forward looking trends in modern art.\n\nThe poem inspired Luigi Russolo to start experimenting with noise music, and is quoted in his Manifesto in 1913, later published in his book \"The Art of Noises\" in 1916. Sections were reproduced in \"Cabaret Voltaire\", the first journal published by Dada.\n\nThe innovative use of typography has influenced a number of artists including Balla, Carra, Boccioni, Hugo Ball and Dada, the Russian futurists, the Vorticists including Wyndham Lewis, Guillaume Apollinaire, Blaise Cendrars, Max Jacob, El Lissitsky and Jan Tschichold. The emphasis on what has since become known as concrete poetry has proved a durable and lasting influence on the development of 20th-century art.\n'...all in all, Futurist \"art\" [painting] was a blind alley. Instead, we can see that what Futurism did was to reassign leadership in the visual arts from painters to designers. Anyone who has admired a poster and found fine art wanting is in touch with the spirit of Marinetti... In fact, Futurism was more like a marketing campaign than an artistic movement. Their fascination with and exploitation of mass media anticipated and influenced advertising in the 20th century.' Stephen Bayley\nChristie's sold a copy of the book in reasonable condition for €10630 in 2011, another copy was valued at around £2000 ($3000) in 2009, with an inscribed copy selling for £2600 in London, May 2008. This is in stark contrast to its value (and reputation) for many years after World War II; a copy was bought by the Tate c.1979 for £65, and as recently as 1993 a copy was sold in London for £250.\n\nCopies can be found in numerous public collections, including the Tate, MOMA, V&A, British Library, & the Penn Library.\n\nThe ZTT Records label and the Swedish 80s new wave pop act Zzzang Tumb were named in homage to the poem.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847974", "title": "Keno City", "text": "Keno City\n\nKeno City is a small community in Yukon, Canada at the end of the Silver Trail highway. Population was 15 in 2006 (stats Canada census). Keno City was the site of a former silver-lead mining area proximal to Keno Hill. Keno City is 13 kilometres away from Elsa, Yukon, which is owned by Alexco Resource Corp who currently own and operate the various Ag-Pb-Zn deposits in the Keno Hill area. Rich silver and lead ore deposits were found on Keno Hill in 1919, and since then the population of the community has fluctuated in response to the mining activity in the area. When in 1989 United Keno Hill closed the mines, literally overnight, the people in the Keno area who decided to stay chose a more sustainable economy: tourism. They successfully marketed Keno City as the quiet, tranquil community.\n\nKeno City was named after the gambling game Keno popular in mining camps at the turn of the 20th century. \nA small placer mining operation is behind Keno City, indicating the present support for active disturbance of earth materials through mining in the vicinity of Keno City. Some people believe that fewer materials will be moved through the new Alexco proposal than have been moved by placer mining around Keno City. The issue, however, is not the amount of material being moved but the placing of an industrial facility (crusher/mill/tailings) close to a residential community.\n\nKeno City has also developed some tourism-based businesses, and its attraction is the Keno Mining Museum with an extensive collection dedicated to the history of mining in Yukon from the early 1900s until the present. The signpost on the top of Keno Hill showing distances to places around the world.\n\nKeno City is located at Mile 69.1 of the Silver Trail, Yukon Highway 11.\n\nThe British Yukon Navigation Company sternwheeler, SS Keno, is preserved in Dawson City and protected as a National Historic Site.\n\nThe 2004 Kim Barlow album \"Luckyburden\" is about Keno City. Two tracks are recorded live at the Keno City Snackbar.\n\nWhitehorse-based singer/songwriter, Megan Haddock, references Keno City in her 2015 song \"Small Town\".\n\nWith the property abandoned by the previous owners, and mounting environmental impacts due to metal laden water coming from mine adits, in 2006 the Federal Government sold the assets of former United Keno Hill Mines through the Supreme Court to an Alexco Resource Corp. (Vancouver based mining company) subsidiary for $410,000. Alexco now became the 100% owner of the Yukon Keno Hill Silver district (23,350 hectares hosting 35 prior producing mines, its own private town of Elsa, and the infrastructure), with a requirement to stop the environmental degradation and a contract to clean up past impacts. With this deal Alexco also became the sole-source clean-up contractor to the Government of Canada in charge to clean up the environmental mess left by former mining activities (estimated $60+ millions of taxpayer's monies).\n\nIn 2009 Alexco decided to resume silver mining in the district. Some of the 15 residents of Keno City have opposed a proposal by Alexco to build the crusher/mill and tailing facility less than one kilometer from their homes in Keno City, YT which will impact this quiet small community. The ore was historically processed in Elsa, which is located approximately 13 km away from Keno City. This proposal was recommended to proceed subject to specified terms and conditions by the Mayo Designated Office of Yukon Socio-Economic Assessment board (YESAB). Yukon's Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR) issued the Quartz Mining Licence in November 2009. While some of the 15 residents of Keno continue to oppose the mill location, support for the project includes the local community of Mayo and the First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun. First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun as well as residents of Mayo live 60 km away from the mill plant. Recent test runs of just the ball mill have shown noise levels of 50- 55 dbA.\n"}
{"id": "1847989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847989", "title": "West Philadelphia", "text": "West Philadelphia\n\nWest Philadelphia, nicknamed West Philly, is a section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Though there is no official definition of its boundaries, it is generally considered to reach from the western shore of the Schuylkill River, to City Avenue to the northwest, Cobbs Creek to the southwest, and the SEPTA Media/Elwyn Line to the south. An alternate definition includes all city land west of the Schuylkill; this would also include Southwest Philadelphia and its neighborhoods. The eastern side of West Philadelphia is also known as University City.\n\nThe topography of West Philadelphia is composed of rolling hills rising slowly from the Schuylkill River toward Cobbs Creek in the west and toward Belmont Plateau in the northwest. This gradual elevation makes the skyline of Center City visible from many points in West Philadelphia. The Wynnefield neighborhood is a location frequently used by photographers and organizers of civic events.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 216,433 people live among the ZIP codes of 19104, 19131, 19139, 19143 and 19151. (Map)\n\n\nStarting with the first wave of Irish immigrants in the early 19th century, West Philadelphia was home to large numbers of European immigrants and their descendants. The area's African American population began growing in the 1880s through the migration of blacks from the southern states; white flight in the early 1960s completed the transition to a majority-black population.\n\nSince the 1980s, gentrification, immigration, and the Urban Indian relocation movement have brought more racial diversity. Arrivals from East Asia and Latin America, mainly Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans, have given the area small Hispanic and Asian American populations. The community has a fair number of Afro-Caribbean/Caribbean American residents, from the Jamaica, Haiti, Barbados, and other areas of the West Indies, as well as a growing number of African immigrants.\n\nThe Woodlands Cemetery, which is located near the west bank of the Schuylkill River, was originally the estate of Andrew Hamilton who bought the property in 1735 from descendants of Blockley Township's founder, William Warner, who hailed from Brockley, England. Warner was the first known European west of the Schuylkill. In 1840, the property was transformed into a cemetery with an arboretum of over 1,000 trees. It holds the graves of many famous Philadelphians.\n\nSatterlee Hospital, one of the largest Union Army hospitals of the Civil War, operated from 1862 to 1865; part of its grounds are now the northern section of Clark Park.\n\nWest Philadelphia's population expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thanks in large part to horsecars, then streetcars, and Schuylkill River bridges that allowed middle-class breadwinners to commute into the Central Business District a few miles to the east. West Philadelphia was among the early streetcar suburbs, and a portion of it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District.\n\nThe western portion of the neighborhood was once home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country (and much striking Victorian-era architecture remains). The area has declined in prominence over the last 50 years, thanks in part to increasing crime and the migration of many middle and upper-class residents to suburbs and other sections of the city.\n\nWest Philadelphia drew national attention in 1978 and 1985 for violent clashes between police and an Afro-centric, back-to-nature group called MOVE. During the latter confrontation, police firebombed the group's headquarters, killing 11 people and destroying an entire block of Osage Avenue and Pine Street.\n\nIn recent years, parts of West Philadelphia have undergone \"Penntrification,\" a term that reflects the University of Pennsylvania's role in gentrification of the neighborhood; including a campaign to rename part of the area University City (the designation now appears on maps as well as public street signs and government listings). Many young professionals and families have moved into the area.\n\nIn 2008, the area around the Please Touch Museum, Philadelphia Zoo, and the Mann Music Center was designated the Centennial District: an area to be revitalized by the country's 250th birthday in 2026.\n\nMost of the houses in West Philadelphia are row houses, although there are areas of semi-detached and detached houses. The earliest developments began in 1850 and the final period of mass construction ended in 1930. Development was enabled by the creation of the horsecar, which pushed development to about 43rd Street, and, after the arrival of the electrified streetcar in 1892, accelerated to the west and southwest. (See West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District and the Market Street Line.)\n\nLargely commissioned by speculative developers and designed by some of the city's most prolific architects, they were purchased by industrial managers and other professionals who led the first movement of upper and middle class from the more crowded city center. Developers found they could increase profits by catering to this emerging group, shrinking lot sizes, and building more compact, less ornate houses.\n\nInitial development was divided into block lots and sold in 1852 with the condition that \"substantial stone or brick buildings\" be erected. The houses in this grouping are primarily three-story Italianate buildings, linked by material, decorative detail, and form. An additional but smaller and less ornate 16 Italianate, brownstone, semi-detached houses, similar in form to the initial houses, were built around Chester Avenue. The setback of these houses was 25 feet, allowing generous front yards.\n\nAnother development on Locust Street, a project by banker and West Philly resident Clarence Howard Clark, comprised three-story, two-bay, brick, restrained Queen Anne rowhouses. The street was unified by front yards, and enclosed by decorative iron fences. The houses melded the suburban principles of front porches and greenspace with the urban rowhouse form, producing profitable, yet desirable, middle-class suburban housing.\n\nOther developments introduced urban density and architectural uniformity: the Queen Anne style with columned porches and decorative spindlework, brickwork and corbelling; steeply pitched gables with fishscale slate shingles; turrets; balconies; and windows with a single pane surrounded by small panes. These houses are typical of the early 20th-century developments in West Philadelphia, and are unified by rhythmic patterning of porch and gable features. The second story, projecting, semi-hexagonal bay is incorporated into this design, an element which defines the later rowhouses.\n\nThe western reaches of West Philadelphia included miles of two-story rowhouses with bay windows above classical columned front porches. What resulted was a collection of Colonial Revival houses with Arts and Crafts influences, which reflect the sophisticated tastes of post-World War I Philadelphians. For the first time in West Philadelphia, houses had garages. Later Tudor and Spanish Revival houses, and the Art Deco influenced apartment houses also filled in available lot spaces between developments and made it possible for more middle-class Philadelphians to move to the area.\n\nOne of West Philadelphia's most prominent features is the \"El\", or SEPTA's Market-Frankford Line or Blue Line. Completed in 1907, this elevated subway line linked West Philadelphia, Millbourne and Upper Darby to Center City and then later to Frankford.\nRunning above and, for a portion, under Market Street, this transportation link is one of Philadelphia's two major transit lines that transport hundreds of thousands of students and workers daily into and around the city. The El once powered the economic engine of West Philadelphia.\n\nRetail districts lined every street where there was a station as well as along Market Street. Most recently many of these retail districts with the exception of 52nd Street have been converted to largely residential areas. One of the aggravating factors in this change has been the recent reconstruction of the EL which, due to detours of the \"number streets\" or numbered North-South thoroughfares and closure of large portions of Market Street, have led to many remaining businesses failing.\n\nAnother major transit link in West Philadelphia are the five Subway Surface Lines, often called the Green Lines for their representation on SEPTA route maps. These include five of Philadelphia's remaining six streetcar lines. Combined, these trolley routes convey more than 150,000 passengers daily, and operate 24-hour schedules, even in blizzards.\n\nThe Route 10 trolley runs along Lancaster Avenue from 63rd and Malvern Avenue through to 36th and Ludlow Streets where a portal allows access to the subway tunnel into Center City. The Route 34 trolley runs along Baltimore Avenue from Cobbs Creek at 61st Street to the transit tunnel at 40th Street in University City. The Route 13 trolley runs along Chester Avenue from the transit tunnel at 40th Street and Baltimore Avenue to 67th Street where it turns off Chester Avenue and continues along PA Route 13 into Yeadon, Delaware County on to its terminus at Green Lane.\n\nThe Route 11 trolley runs along Woodland Avenue from the transit tunnel at 40th Street to the city line at Cobbs Creek and continues into Darby Borough. Finally, the Route 36 trolley is the longest trolley Green Line service. The 36 trolley leaves the 40th Street transit tunnel running along Woodland Avenue until 49th Street where it turns south to continue along Lindbergh Boulevard turning at Elmwood Avenue starting at 55th Street. Route 36 terminates in Southwest Philadelphia at Island Avenue west and 73rd Street, near the Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nTwo other trolley lines originally ran through West Philly. The Route 38 trolley, running from Wynfield to Center City via Belmont Avenue, and the Route 31 trolley, running from Overbrook to Center City via Haverford Avenue, were replaced by diesel buses when the Philadelphia Transit Company transferred control of the trolley service to National City Lines.\n\nWest Philadelphia is also served by five of SEPTA's thirteen Regional Rail Lines, which transport thousands of commuters daily to and from Center City and University City, and provide a quick and inexpensive link to the Philadelphia International Airport. [All 13 serve 30th Street Station on the edge of West Philadelphia.] The Airport Line serves University City at University City Station in the University of Pennsylvania, going on to southern-most Southwest Philadelphia and the airport. The Media/Elwyn Line also serves University City and portions of Southwest Philadelphia before continuing to Media and points beyond.\n\nThe Paoli/Thorndale Line serves Overbrook and Wynnefield, and continues to the \"Main Line\" communities and Paoli. However, the Paoli/Thorndale does not stop anywhere between 30th Street and City Line Avenue, instead bypassing most of West Philadelphia ever since the closure of 52nd Street station. The Cynwyd Line is a limited-service express line from Center City to the Bala Cynwyd neighborhood of Lower Merion Township.\n\nMost of these passenger trips originate outside of the city, but more West Philly residents are using SEPTA's multi-ride \"Transpass\", which allows unlimited rides on SEPTA vehicles within the city limits.\n\nCommunity groups have called on SEPTA to reopen closed Regional Rail stations in areas further away from the Market-Frankford Line and the Broad Street Line.\n\nWest Philadelphia's streets are laid out in a modified grid. The main thoroughfare, Market Street, runs East and West, paralleled to the north and south by smaller streets named for tree species. North-south streets are numbered, rising consecutively from 30th Street at the Schuylkill River to 77th Street on the far western edge near Cobbs Creek and to the block-long 90th Street in Southwest Philadelphia near the airport.\n\nThe highest numbered street to run any considerable distance contiguously is 58th Street, which runs from the northern frontier of West Philadelphia at City Avenue south to the Schuylkill River. 77th and 86th Streets run just a few blocks before they leave the city for surrounding jurisdictions. (For example, 84th Street becomes Hook Road when it crosses into Sharon Hill.) The 77th Street in Overbrook is not contiguous with the 77th Street in the column of streets that ends with 90th Street in Southwest Philadelphia. The two 77th Streets (as well as all numbered streets after 58th) are miles apart.\n\nThe street grid ends at Cobbs Creek Park along with the western political boundary of Philadelphia, but many of the street names and a roughly similar street grid (it begins to degrade outside the city) continue beyond the city limits into Upper Darby Township, into which Market Street runs uninterrupted to 69th street at the El terminal, where it turns into West Chester Pike and runs through Delaware County and into Chester County. With the exception of Market Street, these streets can be regarded as being \"named after\" the streets in West Philadelphia, not continuations, as they are cut off by the park. The numbering pattern is mixed; someone traveling along Market Street into Upper Darby would cross 62nd Street, then Cobbs Creek Parkway/63rd St, then several named streets until finally arriving at 69th Street, skipping 64-68.\n\nOther major thoroughfares include Chestnut and Walnut Streets, which together form Pennsylvania Route 3. Every day, thousands of vehicles travel this route, which is one of the major commuter routes into and out of Philadelphia from Delaware and Chester Counties. In the 1960s and 1970s, illuminated signs announced what speed to drive to travel 4.3 miles into Center City without stopping for a red light. The streets were once lined with American Chestnut and walnut trees that touched across the five lanes of roadway, but many were removed due to Chestnut blight and replaced with a mix of sycamore and poplar trees. City officials found these species much more tolerant of the urban environment and resistant to disease. A handful of chestnut trees remain near Cobbs Creek.\n\nLancaster Avenue begins at 34th street near Drexel University; runs westward to the city line at City Avenue; and continues on as U.S. Route 30 to Lancaster, York, Pittsburgh. and the West Virginia border. One of the major retail strips in West Philadelphia, it is lined with shops and restaurants through to 64th Street in the Wynnefield neighborhood. In addition, one of Philadelphia's six streetcar lines, the Route 10 Green Line, transports commuters and students daily along Lancaster Avenue from 36th and Ludlow streets to 63rd and Malvern Avenue in Wynnefield.\n\nThe intersection of 52nd Street and Market Street in West Philadelphia was listed number eight in a 2007 list of the city's top ten recreational drug corners according to an article by \"Philadelphia Weekly\" reporter Steve Volk.\n\nThe Philadelphia Police Department divides West Philadelphia into four patrol districts: the 16th, 18th, 19th, and 92nd.\n\nThe area's public schools are operated by the School District of Philadelphia.\n\nWest Philadelphia High School was one of the biggest and most diverse schools in state when it was opened in 1911. The students of \"West\" were the children of middle-class black people, as well as of Irish, Jewish, Polish and other immigrant groups.\n\nOther high schools include University City High School; William L. Sayre High School, formerly Sayre Middle School; Robert E. Lamberton High School; Mastery Charter Shoemaker Campus, formerly William Shoemaker Middle School; and Overbrook High School.\n\nElementary schools include Morton McMichael Elementary School and Lea Elementary School. Harrity Elementary School is a district-owned school operated by Mastery Charter Schools.\n\nBlocks away from \"West\" were the West Philadelphia Catholic High Schools for Girls at 46th Street and Boys at 48th Street, now consolidated into West Catholic Preparatory High School in the building at 46th Street. St. Thomas More High School for Boys at 47th and Wyalusing Avenue was closed in 1975 and now houses the Sr Clara Muhammad School.\n\nWest Philadelphia is the home to several universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, and Saint Joseph's University.\n\nWest Philadelphia has about 75 of Philadelphia's 196 blue historic markers, which note historically important birthplaces, homes, business and other places.\nThe nation's oldest zoological garden, the Philadelphia Zoo, has exhibitions and educational programs.

April 1408), commonly known as Miran Shah (), was a son of the Central Asian conqueror Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire. \n\nDuring his father's reign, Miran Shah was initially a powerful regional governor and prominent military commander, having aided Timur in his conquests as well as suppressing several revolts. However, after facing accusations of destructive and hedonistic behaviour, the prince was later deposed from these roles by the emperor. Following Timur's death in 1405, Miran Shah became embroiled in the ensuing war of succession, having thrown his support behind his son Khalil Sultan. He was later killed whilst battling against the Timurid's traditional rivals, the Qara Qoyunlu.\n\nThough never ruling in his own right, the line of Miran Shah played a prominent role in the history of the Timurid Empire. His grandson Abu Sa'id Mirza eventually came to rule the majority of Transoxiana in the latter half of the 15th century. Abu Sa'id's own grandson was Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire of India.\n\nMiran Shah was born in 1366, the third of Timur's four sons. His mother was a concubine, Mengli Khatun, daughter of Hayut of the Jauni Qurban tribe.\n\nIn 1380, prior to his conquest of Khorasan, Timur pre-emptively named Miran Shah (at this point fourteen years old) governor of the region. The kingdom was then under the rule of the Kartid dynasty, who quickly submitted to Timur's army. In 1383, the head of the former royal family, Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali, became complicit in a plot against Timur. Miran Shah quickly crushed the rebellion and annexed the Kartid capital of Herat, which he made his viceregal seat. Several years later, the last of the Kartids, Ghiyas-uddin's son Pir Muhammad, was killed by Miran Shah in a banquet that the latter hosted. Miran Shah, who supposedly laughed while decapitation the prince, later explained his actions were due to excessive drinking.\n\nIn the winter of 1386, Timur launched an invasion of Azerbaijan, an area that had by that point been sought after by the Golden Horde for over a century. Tokhtamysh, the Khan of the Golden Horde and Timur's erstwhile ally, sent his army against the invading force and defeated their advance-guard, resulting in the loss of forty of Timur's officers. Miran Shah was commanded to avenge this defeat and routed the enemy force, pursuing the fleeing soldiers as far as Derbent, the frontier of the Golden Horde. Some of Tokhtamysh's most distinguished followers were taken captive, who were then escorted by Miran Shah to his father's winter quarters in Qarabagh, where they were presented to Timur in chains. Contrary to his usual practise however, Timur treated the prisoners leniently and returned them to Tokhtamysh. They were sent bearing only paternal reproaches towards the Khan, a final, ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Timur to discourage his former mentee from further hostilities.\n\nSeveral revolts were also put down by Miran Shah in subsequent years. In 1389 the governor of Tus, Amir Hajji Beg Jauni Qurbani, aided by a Sarbadar ruler, sought to make himself independent. Timur sent Miran Shah who, after a protracted siege of several months, had Tus sacked and razed, with the city suffering a heavy death toll.\n\nIn 1394, Timur entered a conflict with members of a Sufi sect known as the Hurufis. This was likely as a result of both heresy charges laid against the group by traditional religious scholars, as well as Timur's own attempts to remove potential threats to his rule from the area. Miran Shah was instructed to arrest the founder of the movement Fazlallah Astarabadi al-Hurufi who was, according to legend, executed by the prince himself. The death of their leader led al-Hurufi's followers to have a specific hatred against the Timurids. Miran Shah in particular was considered to be the Dajjal (Antichrist) and was further mocked as \"Maran Shah\" (King of Snakes).\n\nBy 1393, Timur had conquered all the lands that had formerly been part of the Mongol Ilkhanate. This dominion, which Timur termed \"the throne of Hulagu\", was bestowed upon Miran Shah. The prince's fief was now the entirety of northern Persia and Transcaucasia, and included the cities of Baghdad, Tabriz and Soltaniyeh.\n\nHowever Miran Shah, who had been suffering from mental issues following a fall from his horse several years earlier, began to show increasingly destructive tendencies during his rule. Ruy González de Clavijo, the Portuguese ambassador to Timur's court, claimed that the prince had ancient buildings destroyed, supposedly so that it would be known that \"Miran Shah did nothing himself, but he ordered the finest works in the world to be demolished\". The poet Daulatshah reported that Miran Shah also ordered the tomb of the historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani be dismantled and for his bones to be re-interred in a Jewish cemetery. This was said to be due to the latter's Semitic descent. There are doubts however regarding this claim, since Miran Shah was purported to have had an interest in Muslim historic literature.\n\nReports eventually started reaching Timur of his son's behaviour. Stories were heard in the imperial court of chaotic gambling, drinking bouts held within mosques and gold coins being scattered from palace windows to frenzied mobs. Miran Shah's excessive lifestyle evidently took its toll on his health, as he was described by Clavijo as \"big and fat, and he suffers much from the gout.\"\n\nIn addition to this, Timur had concerns regarding unrest and taxation problems in Miran Shah's domains, as well as the prince's military failures. Chief among these was his inability to capture the fortress of Alinja from the Jalairid Sultanate in 1395. Here Prince Tahir, son of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, had been besieged by Miran Shah before being relieved by George VI of Georgia, the combined forces of whom defeated the Timurid army.\n\nWorries had also been raised for the emperor regarding his son's loyalty. Miran Shah had alluded in letters about his father's increasing age and doubts about Timur's continued capabilities of ruling. These suspicions were realised when Miran Shah's wife, the Khwarezmian princess Khanzada Begum, reached out to her father-in-law. Khanzada reported her husband's rebellious intentions as well as complaining about her mistreatment at his hands. Daulatshah states that Timur was moved to tears when Khanzada presented to him her blood-stained chemise, though this episode was not confirmed in contemporary sources. Official histories only state that Miran Shah made crude accusations against her that were later disproved. Nevertheless, the angry Khanzada never returned to her husband and remained with Timur in Samarqand.\n\nIn 1399, Timur sent a detachment of troops under his nephew Sulaiman Shah to investigate his concerns. Miran Shah, without posing any difficulties, returned with them to face his father, who had by this point arrived in Soltaniyeh to confront him. Having tied a rope around his neck, Miran Shah appeared before the emperor and begged for his forgiveness. Timur was said to have been at the point of ordering his son's execution, only refraining due to the intercession of his relatives and nobles. Instead, Miran Shah was deposed from his lands and assigned to Timur's own retinue, where he would remain for the next four years. His friends and advisers, among whom were well known figures, were severely punished, with some being executed for the alleged crime of corrupting the prince and leading him astray.\n\nTimur had never unambiguously appointed an heir, so at the time of his death in February 1405, a succession dispute erupted among his surviving sons and grandsons. Miran Shah was Timur's eldest living son by this point, but was not considered an active contender to the throne and was passed over in favour of his own son, Khalil Sultan.\n\nThe latter proclaimed himself emperor at Tashkent soon after his grandfather's death and seized the royal treasury, as well as Timur's imperial capital Samarqand. Sultan Husayn Tayichiud, a maternal grandson of Timur as well as Miran Shah's son-in-law, also made a bid for the throne before aligning himself with Khalil Sultan. Shah Rukh, governor of Herat and Timur's other surviving son, made no offensive move against his nephews at this point. This was likely due to Miran Shah, who posed a serious threat as he, along with his other son Abu Bakr, had led an army out of Azerbaijan in support of Khalil Sultan.\n\nHowever, Miran Shah and Abu Bakr were forced to withdraw prior to being able to do this. Ahmad Jalayir, who had been expelled by Timur fifteen years previously, took advantage of the old emperor's death to recapture his former lands. The two princes drove out Jalayir at Tabriz before being forced to contend with another former enemy: Qara Yusuf, ruler of the Black Sheep Turkomans.\n\nIn 1406, Qara Yusuf defeated the Timurids at the Battle of Nakhchivan and captured Tabriz. Miran Shah and Abu Bakr attempted to retake the city in the Battle of Sardrud on the 20 April 1408, but were decisively defeated by the joint efforts of the Turkomans and Jalayirids. As a result of this rout, all of Timur's western conquests were lost, with the Timurids being subsequently driven out of western Persia.\n\nThough Abu Bakr had managed to escape, Miran Shah was struck down during the battle by a Turkoman chief who, having not recognised the prince, had stripped and looted his body. Qara Yusuf then had his head impaled before the walls of Tabriz to induce the cities inhabitants to surrender. Shortly thereafter, the Turkoman ruler sent Miran Shah's head and body, along with his own condolences, to Shah Rukh, who had emerged the victor in the war of succession. Miran Shah was buried alongside his father in the Gur-e-Amir in Samarqand.\n\nMiran Shah married three times:\n\nHis concubines were:\nBy Daulatgaldi Agha\nBy Khanzada Begum\nBy Urun Sultan Khanika\nBy Murad Agha\nBy Ruhparwar Agha\nBy Daulat Bakht Agha\nBy Mihr Nush Fuladbuqakhani\nBy unnamed mothers\n"}

In 1751, there were two attacks on blockhouses surrounding Halifax. Mi'kmaq attacked the North Blockhouse (located at the north end of Joseph Howe Drive) and killed the men on guard. They also attacked near the South Blockhouse (located at the south end of Joseph Howe Drive), at a saw-mill on a stream flowing out of Chocolate Lake into the Northwest Arm. They killed two men. (Map of Halifax Blockhouses)\n\nIn 1753, when Lawrence became governor, the Mi'kmaq attacked again upon the sawmills near the South Blockhouse on the Northwest Arm, where they killed three British. The Mi'kmaq made three attempts to retrieve the bodies for their scalps.\n\nOriginal names for the community included Dutch Village, North-West Arm, and Armdale District. During the 1960s, the city of Halifax amalgamated Armdale and neighbouring Spryfield, Fairview and Rockingham in a westward expansion off the Halifax Peninsula.\n\nFrom 1969 until the creation of Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996, Armdale and its neighbouring communities west of the Halifax Peninsula were grouped under the colloquial term \"Mainland Halifax\".\n\nThe community was at the head of the Northwest Arm, west of the Canadian National Railway tracks leading to downtown Halifax. Armdale railway station was once located near the Chebucto Road underpass. The community also extended for a short distance up the St. Margaret's Bay Road, Herring Cove Road, and Purcell's Cove Road but was mostly concentrated in the valley near the junction of these roads.\n\nThe largest employer during the 20th century in the Armdale area was Simpson's and later Simpsons-Sears, which operated a large warehouse for its catalogue division beside the railway line. This was later superseded by Maritime Life Assurance Company, which was absorbed by Manulife Financial in 2004. Armdale had its own post office, which no longer operates.\n\nPrior to and following amalgamation with the City of Halifax, Armdale developed into a residential neighborhood consisting of single family homes and small apartment buildings. A nearby commercial district in West End Halifax centred on the Halifax Shopping Centre and West End Mall has kept Armdale relatively free from retail development.\n\nToday, the name Armdale is mostly associated with a traffic circle located at the junction of Herring Cove Road, St. Margaret's Bay Road, Quinpool Road, Chebucto Road, and Joseph Howe Drive.\n"}

This route is also used to introduce drugs that fight certain infections, particularly post-neurosurgical. The drug needs to be given this way to avoid being stopped by the blood brain barrier. The same drug given orally must enter the blood stream and may not be able to pass out and into the brain. Drugs given by the intrathecal route often have to be compounded specially by a pharmacist or technician because they cannot contain any preservative or other potentially harmful inactive ingredients that are sometimes found in standard injectable drug preparations.\n\nThe route of administration is sometimes simply referred to as \"intrathecal\"; however, the term is also an adjective that refers to something occurring in or introduced into the anatomic space or potential space inside a sheath, most commonly the arachnoid membrane of the brain or spinal cord (under which is the subarachnoid space). For example, intrathecal immunoglobulin production is production of antibodies in the spinal cord. The abbreviation \"IT\" is best not used; instead, \"intrathecal\" is spelled out to avoid medical mistakes.\n\n\n\nOften reserved for spastic cerebral palsy, intrathecally-administered baclofen is done through an intrathecal pump implanted just below the skin of the abdomen, (or behind the chest wall, depending on the surgeon implanting the device, and patient preferences), with a tube (called the 'catheter') connected directly to the base of the spine, where it bathes the spinal cord using a dose about one thousand times smaller than that required by orally-administered baclofen. Intrathecal baclofen also carries none of the side effects, such as sleepiness, that typically occur with oral baclofen.

Clayton (July 17, 1814 – December 4, 1879) was an early leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who was a clerk and scribe to the religious leader Joseph Smith. Clayton, born in England, was also an American pioneer journalist, inventor, lyricist, and musician.\n\nClayton was born in Penwortham, Lancashire, England, the son of Thomas Clayton and Ann Critchley. He was the eldest of 14 children. He married Ruth Moon on October 9, 1836.\n\nIn 1837, Clayton investigated the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Taught by church apostles Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde, Clayton was baptized October 21, 1837; ordained a priest in December; and a high priest on April 1, 1838. Clayton's parents and siblings also joined the church. Clayton quit his job as a factory clerk to devote his time to missionary service in England, where he founded a branch of the church in Manchester. In 1838, he served as second counselor to the British mission president Joseph Fielding, with Willard Richards as first counselor. \n\nIn September 1840, Clayton led a group of British converts who emigrated to the United States. He and his family first tried to farm in Iowa Territory, then settled in the predominantly Latter Day Saint community of Nauvoo, Illinois. There he was a clerk and scribe to Joseph Smith. In an 1840 letter, Clayton wrote to church members in Manchester about interacting with Smith:\n\nWe have had the privilege of conversing with Joseph Smith Jr. and we are delighted with his company. We have had a privilege of ascertaining in a great measure from whence all the evil reports have arisen and hitherto have every reason to believe him innocent. He is not an idiot, but a man of sound judgment, and possessed of abundance of intelligence and whilst you listen to his conversation you receive intelligence which expands your mind and causes your heart to rejoice. He is very familiar, and delights to instruct the poor saints. I can converse with him just as easy as I can with you, and with regard to being willing to communicate instruction he says, \"I receive it freely and I will give it freely.\" He is willing to answer any question I have put to him and is pleased when we ask him questions.\n\nClayton was responsible for maintaining church records in Nauvoo, including those considered private and sacred. Other positions in the church and community included: \n\nIn 1843, Smith dictated a revelation on plural marriage to Clayton. As the practice of polygamy was initially secret, Clayton spent time dealing with rumors and innuendo about the practice both in the church and surrounding community. he accepted plural marriage as a religious principle, and ultimately married nine wives and fathered 42 children. Three of his wives later left him.\n\nClayton's impressions of day-to-day activities, recorded in a series of personal journals, describe the social activities of mid-19th century America and the evolution of Mormon religious culture.\n\nAfter Smith's death, Clayton helped complete Smith's official church history, using his personal journals as a major source. Clayton's personal records were at times incorporated into official Mormon scripture and history without recognition of their source. His notes were one of four sources used to reconstruct a sermon by Smith known as the \"King Follett Discourse\". Published sections of Clayton's journals also provide a detailed description of the Nauvoo Temple and an account of the Latter Day Saints' efforts to complete temple endowments for all interested members before being forced to leave Illinois.\n\nEarly in February 1846, Clayton left Nauvoo with the first Latter Day Saint group in their exodus to the West. He spent the winter of 1846–47 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. The following year, he was a member of the vanguard company that crossed the plains to select a western site for Mormon colonization. He was a recording scribe for Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, during the journey. The group traveled along the Platte River into present day Wyoming territory and crossed the continental divide, ultimately reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley in modern Utah.\n\nClayton's pioneer journal, later published, is the most well-known account of the expedition. He noted that land in the Salt Lake valley would be easy to clear as it had limited timber, and expressed concern over the apparent scarcity of rainfall. Clayton later prepared and published \"The Latter-day Saints' Emigrants' Guide\", a meticulous description of the route from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake City, with suggestions for camping places. Using his odometer, the guide had the most accurate distances of the day. It was a valuable guide for Mormon migrants, but was also used by pioneers bound for the Oregon and California territories.\n\nIn April 1846, while camped near Locust Creek on the plains of Iowa, Clayton wrote the words to the popular Mormon hymn, now known as \"Come, Come, Ye Saints\", which is sung to the music of a traditional English song, \"All is Well\". The hymn was in response to good news from Mormons still living in Nauvoo. One of his plural wives, Diantha, had given birth to a healthy baby boy, William Adriel Benoni Clayton. In his journal, he stated that he \"composed a new song—'All is well.' I feel to thank my heavenly father for my boy and pray that he will spare and preserve his life and that of his mother and so order it so that we may soon meet again.\"\n\nTo modern Latter-day Saints, this hymn signifies the difficulties and faith involved in the Mormon migration to the west. Some of Clayton's other poems have also been put to music, including \"When First the Glorious Light of Truth\", also used as a hymn by the LDS Church.\n\nClayton is credited with inventing a version of the modern odometer, during this trip across the plains from Nauvoo, Illinois to Utah, with the help of apostle and mathematician Orson Pratt. Clayton was assigned to record the number of miles the company traveled each day. This was accomplished by tying a red flag onto one of the wagon wheels, and counting the revolutions. After three weeks, Clayton tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with Pratt, he developed a design consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \"counting\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. The apparatus was built by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon. Clayton's journal records: \"About noon today Brother Appleton Harmon completed the machinery on the wagon called a 'roadometer' by adding a wheel to revolve once in ten miles, showing each mile and also each quarter mile we travel, and then casing the whole over so as to secure it from the weather.\" The \"roadometer\" was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847.\n\nOnce settled in Utah, Clayton continued to maintain church records and also participated in public and private business activities. He became an auditor for Utah Territory, as well as recorder of marks and brands, holding both positions until his death. Clayton also worked as treasurer of the Deseret Telegraph Company and as secretary of Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI), a church based cooperative business enterprise. Private ventures included collecting debts, filing land claims, acting as a legal advocate, lending money, merchandising, farming, and mining speculation.\n\nClayton was active in cultural activities in the Salt Lake Valley, particularly those associated with music. He died in Salt Lake City on December 4, 1879. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Latterly he sat as an independent Member of Parliament (MP) and AM for the same constituency.\n\nBorn in Abergavenny, Law was educated at Grofield Secondary School and then attended Nant-y-Glo Community College. He later studied at the Open University. He ran a General Store between 1964 and 1987. He was subsequently appointed chair of Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust.\n\nLaw served as a councillor for Nantyglo and Blaenau Urban District Council between 1970 and 1974. He continued to serve as a councillor on Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council until 1999 and was appointed mayor for 1988-89.\n\nHe was latterly a close ally of Llew Smith, MP for Blaenau Gwent from 1992, and was selected for the constituency in the first elections to the National Assembly for Wales in 1999, winning the seat easily. He was appointed to the cabinet of Alun Michael as Assembly Secretary for Local Government and Housing, but lost his post in a cabinet reshuffle in 2000 by successor First Minister for Wales Rhodri Morgan.\n\nWhen Morgan formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, Peter Law made no secret of his opposition to the decision and was not retained in the administration. He became a vociferous backbench critic and following his re-election with an increased majority in the 2003 election he stood as candidate for the Deputy Presiding Officer of the Welsh Assembly. However, the Labour AMs voted instead for John Marek who was an Independent AM, thereby ensuring that an opposition member was in the Chair and unable to vote against the Welsh Assembly Government.\n\nLaw left the Labour Party in protest at the use of an all-woman shortlist in selecting the candidate for the general election, which was used to replace the retiring Llew Smith. Law believed all-woman shortlists were being selectively imposed on local parties only where a leadership supported male candidate was unlikely to be selected, citing the example of Ed Balls and Pat McFadden as new leadership-supported male candidates, and noting that use of all-woman shortlists had been stopped in Scotland.\n\nSmith had enjoyed a majority of 19,313, making it the safest parliamentary seat in Wales. Prior to the announcement of Law's rumoured candidacy, his Labour opponent Maggie Jones stated that Law would be \"very foolish\" to stand against her. She argued \"Blaenau Gwent is solidly Labour and I don't think people will vote for anyone else.\"\n\nLaw won the seat with 58.2% of the vote, defeating Labour candidate Maggie Jones, and gaining a majority of 9,121 votes. His successful campaign was all the more remarkable, given that he campaigned while recovering for surgery for a brain tumour. Law initially withdrew from the election on 4 April upon receiving the news of his tumour, but he was persuaded to continue standing, receiving treatment throughout the campaign.\n\nShortly after his victory, Law highlighted his former party's failure to acknowledge the problems with the use of all-women short-lists, stating: \"What I find very strange is that even after the result in Blaenau Gwent, there is no one in the party [Labour] who is prepared to admit that they were wrong.\" Law noted Prime Minister Tony Blair's initial misgivings about the shortlist and how this contrasted with the views of his wife Cherie Blair, questioning whether she had excessive influence over the UK leader\n\nLaw's independent position has a particularity significant impact in the Welsh Assembly, as it meant Labour lost its majority. As a result, the party suffered a number of defeats by combined opposition parties who, when they agreed to do so, were able to vote down a various of Labour policies.\n\nLaw was the third Welsh MP or AM to win a constituency as both a party candidate and an independent, following S. O. Davies who was MP for Merthyr Tydfil from 1934 until his death in 1972, who was deselected by the local Labour Party on grounds of age prior to the 1970 general election but ran against the official candidate as an independent and won; and John Marek who remained AM for Wrexham, later forming his own party, Forward Wales.\n\nLaw won the award of Welsh Politician of the Year by both BBC Wales and the Wales Yearbook.\n\nLaw married Trish Bolter in 1976 and they have three daughter and two sons. They lived in Nantyglo.\n\nLaw died at his home in Nantyglo, aged 58, suffering from a recurrent brain tumour first diagnosed during the 2005 election campaign. As a result of his death, there were by-elections in Blaenau Gwent for both the UK Parliament and the Welsh Assembly seats. In the by-elections Law's former agent, Dai Davies, won the election to Law's former Westminster seat, while his widow Trish Law succeeded him in the Welsh Assembly. Both stood under the banner of the Blaenau Gwent People's Voice Group.\n\nHis widow has claimed that he was offered a peerage not to stand against Labour in Blaenau Gwent in 2005, an allegation denied by Labour, The claim had considerable media impact because of the ongoing Cash for Peerages police investigation.\n\nLaw's funeral was held on Thursday 4th May 2006, at Christchurch in Ebbw Vale, exactly a year after he was elected to parliament. Some schools and businesses closed in order to allow people to see the cortège, and people lined the streets, with the funeral described as the biggest in the town since that of Nye Bevan.

West (politician)\n\nJames Elton \"Jim\" West (March 28, 1951 – July 22, 2006) was an American politician. In 2005, while Mayor of Spokane, Washington, he was the target of allegations of the sexual abuse of boys twenty years earlier. These allegations became public after West became a target of a sting operation conducted by his hometown newspaper, the \"Spokesman Review\". Some journalists and academics criticized the paper for what they saw as a form of entrapment. West admitted engaging in homosexual behavior with adults, despite an earlier record of supporting \"anti-gay\" legislation. Though never charged, he was removed from office by recall in 2005. The Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually closed its investigation and took no action for lack of evidence.\n\nWest was born in Oregon and raised in Spokane, Washington. He served in the U.S. Army after high school and graduated from Gonzaga University with a degree in Criminal Justice in 1978.\n\nIn 1982, West was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives as a Republican representing the 6th legislative district. He was elected to the Washington State Senate in 1986 serving until his resignation to become Mayor of Spokane, Washington, in 2003. In the Senate West held the positions of Chairman of the Committee on Health, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and Majority Leader. \n\nDuring his years in the legislature, West developed a record as an opponent of homosexual rights. He supported several \"anti-gay\" bills, including one that would have banned gays and lesbians from working in schools and day care centers. He unsuccessfully proposed a law banning all sexual activity among unmarried persons under the age of 18. In 1995, when West was a state senator, he advocated the impeachment of Gov. Mike Lowry for alleged sexual harassment.\n\nHe served as Mayor of Spokane from 2003 to 2005.\n\nIn June 2003, under editor Steven A. Smith, the \"Spokesman Review\", Spokane's only daily newspaper, began a series of investigative reports into a series of sexual abuse incidents that had occurred in Spokane during the 1970s and 1980s, but went unreported at the time. Reporter Bill Morlin worked on the story for more than a year but failed to find a link between West and the crimes committed by his friend David D. Hahn twenty years earlier.\n\nThe newspaper nevertheless targeted West in a sting operation. In 2004, reporter Morlin received a tip about West from a source that has never been publicly identified. The source claimed that the real identity of the persona on the gay.com website named \"Cobra82\" was in fact Mayor West. The \"Spokesman Review\" then hired a professional investigator to create a false online persona on Gay.com named \"Motobrock.\" This tactic was then used by the newspaper to arrange a meeting between the two. When Jim West turned up for the meeting on a Spokane golf course the newspaper editor was also present and correctly concluded that Cobra82 was the mayor.\n\nIn 2005, sex-abuse charges against West surfaced in the \"Spokesman Review\". Robert J. Galliher claimed that West had committed sexual abuse against him while a member of West's Boy Scout troop. These charges about events two decades old could not be confirmed by other witnesses and Galliher's long criminal record tended to discredit him as well. West called the molestation allegations \"flat lies,\" but admitted to having private online relationships in the past year through the Gay.com website. It was alleged that he offered unpaid internships to young gay men, none under the age of 18, though some were just graduating from high school. West denied charges that he had sought out minors.\n\nCalls for his resignation spread. West defended himself on the \"Today Show\" on May 30, 2005. He explained his support for laws unfavorable to gays in this way: \"If someone hires you to paint their house red, then you paint it red. Even if you think it would look better green.\" In a Spokane City Council meeting immediately afterward, a resolution requesting that he step down passed unanimously (7–0), yet West announced he intended to continue on as Mayor.\n\nOn June 2, the Spokane County Republican Party, Washington State Republican Party, and Spokane County Democratic Chairwoman Katie Kirking called for West's resignation. The FBI conducted its own investigation and a special city commission was set up to investigate and determine if any laws or policies had been broken In early August, 2005, the FBI searched West's home and seized his personal computers as part of its public corruption investigation.\n\nOrganizers of a recall gathered a sufficient number of signatures, and a special mail-in election was held on December 6, 2005, to determine whether West would remain in office. West was recalled by the voters with 65% in favor of ousting him to 35% in favor of keeping him as mayor. His term ended on December 16, 2005, the day the final votes were certified by the Spokane County Auditor's office. West's ouster marked the first time in the history of Spokane that a sitting mayor was recalled out of office.\n\nOn February 16, 2006 the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued its report closing its investigation of West. In the FBI report, Attorney Mark Bartlett said, \"We did not find facts that would justify initiating federal criminal charges.\"\n\nJim West proposed to Ginger Marshall from the Floor of the Washington State Senate. They were married for five years.\n\nGinger Marshall said this about Jim West: \"He cared about Spokane. He cared about the people. He cared about the infrastructure, that Spokane be and continue to be a vibrant city. He always wanted more for Spokane. He served Spokane from the time he graduated from college. He started his career as a deputy sheriff and was a City Council member. Was a member of the House of Representatives and then the State Senate. He had ambitions to do good things for Spokane, and it grew into ambitions for doing good work for the state as a whole.\"\n\nIn the final days of his life, West was mulling over another opportunity to run for office. He also told KREM 2 in his last TV interview that during his tenure in the state legislature he only regretted one vote, for a bill that would have banned gays from working in schools and day-care centers.\n\nWest was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2003. By the early fall of 2005 West's isolation from the Spokane community was nearly complete. He had only a few friends and family to turn to for support during his illness. He joined the conservative Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church of Spokane led by Pastor Lonnie Mitchell. He received support there and attended services regularly until his death from complications from cancer on July 22, 2006.\n\nList of votes from all of West's elections.\n\n"}

(One of his juvenile sculptures 'Big Cat' was acquired by Essex University and put on permanent display outside the library.)\n\nAfter obtaining an 8mm movie camera for Christmas in 1975, he began experimenting with pixilation, stop-motion plasticine, paper-drawn and cel animation. \nHe had some early prize-winning successes in animation competitions. Most notably, he won the Young Film-Maker's Competition of the Year Award 1980 on the long-running (1969 to 1984) BBC children's quiz series \"Screen Test\" for his animated short \"The Rainbow\". This was hailed in 2001 on Channel 4's \"100 Greatest Kids' TV shows\" by ex-Screen Test presenters Michael Rodd and Brian Trueman as \"the only occasion in the history of the competition where we came across a piece of film that was spectacularly professional\", a clip of him receiving the award is shown in the 2007 film \"Son of Rambow\".\n\nHe went on to study Computer Science at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated with first class honours and obtained his PhD, During this time he also represented his university in archery, fencing and hang-gliding competitions, and continued developing his cartoon drawing skills.\n\nAfter university he turned to a career in computer animation initially in London, with Digital Pictures, who specialised in TV commercials.\n\nIn 1993 he joined Pixar, and moved to the USA. His \"Arrows\" TV commercial for Listerine won the Gold Clio Award in 1994.\n\nHis 1997 animated short \"Geri's Game\" won the Oscar for Best Animated Short on his mother's birthday, which prompted him to dedicate the award to her long-distance, with a message in Czech and won a string of other awards.\n\nThe short film \"67 Aluminum Plates\" was created during the 1998 Ottawa International Animation Festival by a group of volunteers under the direction of Jan Pinkava. The film is stop motion, filmed in one long day and edited the next. It was shown on the closing night of the festival.\n\nIn 2000, he began work as director on \"Ratatouille\", a European-flavoured, ultimate-outsider tale based on his original story. This was to have been his feature film debut and the first Pixar film beyond the terms of the then-expiring Pixar-Disney franchise. \nIn 2005, Pinkava was replaced as main director by \"The Incredibles\" director Brad Bird. In an interview given in 2006, Pinkava had \"no comment\" about this turn of events and for two years staunchly refrained from comment on the genesis of the film. At the time when he was replaced, Pinkava had written the core storyline of the film and created the styling, key characters, and sets. Following his departure from the project, Pinkava initially undertook other duties and then left the company. In the final film, Pinkava is credited for his original story idea and as the co-director. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including a nomination for Pinkava (along with Jim Capobianco and Bird) in the Best Original Screenplay category.\n\nHe subsequently worked as a director at LAIKA on his new film \"Little White Lie\", but left in 2011; along with Claire Jennings, the studio's head of entertainment.\n\nIn his most recent assignment, with Motorola Mobility, he came up with a new, in-phone, interactive animation genre.\n\nHe is the third-born of four children of the Czech polymath Václav Pinkava alias Jan Křesadlo.

It began in mid-November 1912 and ended on 26 March 1913 with the capture of Edirne (Adrianople) by the Bulgarian 2nd Army and the Serbian 2nd Army.\n\nThe loss of Edirne delivered the final decisive blow on the Ottoman army and brought the First Balkan War to a close. A treaty was signed in London on 30 May. The city was reoccupied and retained by the Ottomans during the Second Balkan War.\n\nThe victorious end of the siege was considered to be an enormous military success because the city's defenses had been carefully developed by leading German siege experts and called 'undefeatable'. The Bulgarian army, after five months of siege and two bold night attacks, took the Ottoman stronghold.\n\nThe victors were under the overall command of General Nikola Ivanov, and the commander of the Bulgarian forces on the eastern sector of the fortress was General Georgi Vazov, the brother of the famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov and of General Vladimir Vazov.\n\nOne early use of an airplane for bombing took place during the siege: the Bulgarians dropped special hand grenades from one or more airplanes in an effort to cause panic among Ottoman soldiers. Many young Bulgarian officers and professionals who took part in this decisive battle of the First Balkan War would later play important roles in Bulgarian politics, culture, commerce and industry.\n\nThe final battle consisted of two night attacks. Preparations for the battle included covering all metal parts of the uniforms and weapons with tissue to avoid any shine or noise. The several armies that took part in the siege were put under joint command, creating a prototype of a front. Some light artillery pieces towed by horses followed the advancing units, which played the role of infantry support guns. Attempts were made to perturb all Ottomans' radio communications to isolate and demoralize the besieged troops. On 24 March 1913, the external fortifications began to be captured in one night, and the next night, the fortress itself fell into Bulgarian hands. Early in the morning on 26 March 1913, the commander of the fortress, Mehmed Şükrü Pasha, surrendered to the Bulgarian army, which ended the siege.\n\nAfter the surrender, large parts of the city, especially the houses of Muslims and Jews, were subjected to looting for three days. However, it is disputed who actually carried out the looting since some accounts accuse the Bulgarian army and other sources accuse the local Greek population. \n\nThe Bulgarian achievements until were fairly summarized by a British war correspondent: \"A nation with a population of less than five million and a military budget of less than two million pounds per annum placed in the field within fourteen days of mobilization an army of 400,000 men, and in the course of four weeks moved that army over 160 miles in hostile territory, captured one fortress and invested another, fought and won two great battles against the available armed strength of a nation of twenty million inhabitants, and stopped only at the gates of the hostile capital. With the exception of the Japanese and Gurkhas, the Bulgarians alone of all troops go into battle with the fixed intention of killing at least one enemy.\" There were many journalists who reported on the Siege of Adrianople; their accounts provide rich details about it.\n\nSerbian units involved were the 2nd Army, under the command of General (later Vojvoda, equivalent to Field Marshal) Stepa Stepanović (two divisions and some support units) and heavy artillery (38 siege cannons and howitzers of 120 and 150 mm purchased from French Schneider-Canet factory in 1908); they had been dispatched because the Bulgarians lacked heavy artillery (though they were well supplied with Krupp-designed 75 mm field artillery).\n\nSerbian forces, commanded by General Stepa Stepanović, arrived on 6 November 1912. In Mustafa Pasha Place, a railway station outside Odrin, Stepanović immediately reported to the supreme commander, General Nikola Ivanov. The Serbian Second Army was formed from the Timok Division without the 14th Regiment, the Second Danube Division reinforced with the 4th Reserve Regiment and the Second Drina Artillery Division. There was a total of 47,275 Serbian troops with 72 artillery guns, 4,142 horses and oxen and 3,046 cars.\n\nThe arrival of the Serbian soldiers greatly improved the morale of the Bulgarian troops at Odrin. Both Serbian divisions were immediately sent to the front. The Timok Division, strengthened by a Bulgarian regiment, occupied the north-western sector between Maritsa and Tundzha Rivers, its sector being 15 km long. The Danube Division occupied a 5 km stretch of the western sector between the Maritsa and Arda Rivers. A combined brigade was formed from the Timok Cavalry Regiment and the Bulgarian guard Cavalry Regiment to scout the Maritsa Valley. \n\n\n"}

Seen as a high flier, she went on to serve as a minister in Gordon Brown's government from 2007 to 2009, mainly at the Treasury, but also at the Department for Work and Pensions, having previously been a Special Advisor at the Department for Trade and Industry. At the time she was the second-youngest government minister, and the youngest woman.\n\nUssher resigned from her ministerial role in 2009. She did not stand at the 2010 election, citing the desire for a more normal family life while her children were young. Since, she has worked primarily in public policy thought leadership, at Demos and as Managing Director of Tooley Street Research .\n\nUssher is the daughter of an Anglo-Irish lawyer father and a headmistress mother whose brother is Peter Bottomley. Consequently, she is a niece of the former Conservative cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley, and a granddaughter of the diplomat Sir James Bottomley.

The new intake of MPs was called the brightest for a generation . \n\nFrom 2005 to 2006, Ussher was a member of the Public Accounts Committee. She was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Margaret Hodge, the Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, until 29 June 2007.\n\nIn Gordon Brown's first reshuffle, she was appointed as City Minister, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, succeeding Ed Balls. The timing of her appointment, as the first signs of the credit crunch appeared, meant that she was party to crucial meetings of the Tripartite Committee of Treasury, FSA and the Bank of England as the authorities dealt with the collapse of Northern Rock, the subsequent financial crisis and its legislative response. She chaired the Treasury Islamic Finance Group , leading to the issuance of the first sukuk government bond, co-chaired with Hector Sants the official High-Level Working Group on the efficiency of the UK capital-raising process and co-chaired with Sir Michael Snyder the High-Level Working Group on the professional services sector .\n\nHer period in office also saw a review of the policy towards co-operatives and credit unions, to give them greater commercial freedom and ability to expand. She also developed the policy leading to the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008 that redistributes unclaimed banking assets to community use, and the Savings Gateway Act 2009 that provides financial incentives to poorer people to save.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, she moved to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions, taking on broad welfare reform responsibilities previously undertaken by Stephen Timms and James Plaskitt. At the time of the reshuffle, she was described by Martin Waller, city diarist of \"The Times\", as \"one of the brighter denizens of the lower depths of the Brown administration\" who had \"made herself popular enough in the City\".\n\nIn the June 2009 reshuffle she was moved back to the Treasury, this time promoted to Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, but ten days later resigned to prevent embarrassment to the government regarding her tax position, and was replaced by Sarah McCarthy-Fry, the MP for Portsmouth North.\n\nUssher resigned as a minister in June 2009, noting that technically she had done nothing wrong but citing a desire to \"prevent embarrassment to the government\" after allegations that she also changed the designation of her home for tax purposes. Ussher lived in both London and Burnley and had designated her Burnley house as the main residence prior to its sale .\n\nIn her resignation letter Ussher wrote that it was: \"with the greatest regret that I have decided to resign from the government. After careful consideration I arrived at this decision because I do not want to cause you or the government any embarrassment. I did not do anything wrong. At all times my actions have been in line with HM Revenue and Customs guidance and based on the advice of a reputable firm of accountants who in turn were recommended to me by the House of Commons fees office. Neither have I abused the allowance system of the House of Commons in any way... As you know I also decided some time ago, completely for family reasons, that I would not be putting my name forward to contest the next general election. The hours of Parliament simply don't work with kids.\".\n\nIn his reply to her resignation letter, Brown praised her \"contribution to government\", adding: “I respect your decision to leave parliament at the time of the next general election.” .\n\nCommenting on her resignation, the BBC described her as a \"rising star\" who had risen quickly through the ranks, despite only being elected in 2005.. The Independent newspaper commented that her departure from the Government and the Labour benches was a blow to Gordon Brown. “At 38, she was one of his youngest ministers and had been marked out for a bright future having already taken on jobs at the Treasury and the Department of Work and Pensions.” .\n\nFour years later in an article on her blog she said she had voluntarily paid the amount in question to HMRC of £3,420, stating that \"public servants should always be at pains to ensure that they are not only compliant with the letter of the law but also with the spirit of it\". .\n\nIn May 2010, after leaving Parliament, Ussher became the new Chief Executive of Demos until 2012 . She then became a research fellow of the Smith Institute, an associate at the Centre for London, a member of TheCityUK's Independent Economists' Panel, and a co founder of Labour in the City.\n\nIn December 2013, she became Managing Director of Tooley Street Research, and economic and policy adviser to Portland Communications.

Dorton's engines helped guide the team to nine NASCAR titles (five in the Winston Cup Series, one in the Busch Series, and three in the Craftsman Truck Series). Dorton also worked with General Motors and Hendrick Motorsports in the research and development department.\n\nOn October 24, 2004, Dorton and nine others boarded a Beechcraft Super King Air heading to Martinsville Speedway for the Subway 500. Flying into foggy weather, the pilots became disoriented, and flew five miles past Blue Ridge Airport, and when they attempted to perform the missed approach procedure, the plane flew two miles without making the necessary right turn, and the plane crashed into Bull Mountain, killing all on board; the race would begin 27 minutes later. Hendrick driver Jimmie Johnson won the race, though no post-race celebrations were held.\n\nIn February 2006, Dorton's wife Dianne filed a lawsuit against Rick Hendrick alleging that he and his team were liable for Dorton's death, and claimed the team \"showed 'conscious and intentional disregard' for Randy Dorton's safety, alleging that company president John Hendrick rejected the pilot's suggestion to divert to a different airport because of bad weather because he didn't want to be late for the race.\" The suits were settled in 2011, six years after the crash.\n\nIn tribute to Dorton, a 900-horsepower engine was built and used by Jimmie Johnson in a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro before being placed on display in the Hendrick Motorsports Museum.\n\nThe trophy awarded to the winner of the Mahle Engine Builders Challenge is named the Randy Dorton Trophy in his honor.\n\nSon of Jimmy and Lorene Dorton, he has a son, Jonathan, and a brother, Keith.\n"}
{"id": "1848052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848052", "title": "Indian mathematics", "text": "Indian mathematics\n\nIndian mathematics emerged in the Indian subcontinent from 1200 BC until the end of the 18th century. In the classical period of Indian mathematics (400 AD to 1200 AD), important contributions were made by scholars like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara II, and Varāhamihira. The decimal number system in use today was first recorded in Indian mathematics. Indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the concept of zero as a number, negative numbers, arithmetic, and algebra. In addition, trigonometry\nwas further advanced in India, and, in particular, the modern definitions of sine and cosine were developed there. These mathematical concepts were transmitted to the Middle East, China, and Europe and led to further developments that now form the foundations of many areas of mathematics.\n\nAncient and medieval Indian mathematical works, all composed in Sanskrit, usually consisted of a section of \"sutras\" in which a set of rules or problems were stated with great economy in verse in order to aid memorization by a student. This was followed by a second section consisting of a prose commentary (sometimes multiple commentaries by different scholars) that explained the problem in more detail and provided justification for the solution. In the prose section, the form (and therefore its memorization) was not considered so important as the ideas involved. All mathematical works were orally transmitted until approximately 500 BCE; thereafter, they were transmitted both orally and in manuscript form. The oldest extant mathematical \"document\" produced on the Indian subcontinent is the birch bark Bakhshali Manuscript, discovered in 1881 in the village of Bakhshali, near Peshawar (modern day Pakistan) and is likely from the 7th century CE.\n\nA later landmark in Indian mathematics was the development of the series expansions for trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and arc tangent) by mathematicians of the Kerala school in the 15th century CE. Their remarkable work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any \"direct\" evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.\n\nExcavations at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation have uncovered evidence of the use of \"practical mathematics\". The people of the Indus Valley Civilization manufactured bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favourable for the stability of a brick structure. They used a standardised system of weights based on the ratios: 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500, with the unit weight equaling approximately 28 grams (and approximately equal to the English ounce or Greek uncia). They mass-produced weights in regular geometrical shapes, which included hexahedra, barrels, cones, and cylinders, thereby demonstrating knowledge of basic geometry.\n\nThe inhabitants of Indus civilisation also tried to standardise measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler—the \"Mohenjo-daro ruler\"—whose unit of length (approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts. Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.\n\nHollow cylindrical objects made of shell and found at Lothal (2200 BCE) and Dholavira are demonstrated to have the ability to measure angles in a plane, as well as to determine the position of stars for navigation.\n\nThe religious texts of the Vedic Period provide evidence for the use of large numbers. By the time of the \"\" (1200–900 BCE), numbers as high as were being included in the texts. For example, the \"mantra\" (sacred recitation) at the end of the \"annahoma\" (\"food-oblation rite\") performed during the \"aśvamedha\", and uttered just before-, during-, and just after sunrise, invokes powers of ten from a hundred to a trillion:\n\nThe solution to partial fraction was known to the Rigvedic People as states in the purush Sukta (RV 10.90.4):\n\nThe Satapatha Brahmana (ca. 7th century BCE) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba Sutras.\n\nThe \"Śulba Sūtras\" (literally, \"Aphorisms of the Chords\" in Vedic Sanskrit) (c. 700–400 BCE) list rules for the construction of sacrificial fire altars. Most mathematical problems considered in the \"Śulba Sūtras\" spring from \"a single theological requirement,\" that of constructing fire altars which have different shapes but occupy the same area. The altars were required to be constructed of five layers of burnt brick, with the further condition that each layer consist of 200 bricks and that no two adjacent layers have congruent arrangements of bricks.\n\nAccording to , the \"Śulba Sūtras\" contain \"the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians.\" The diagonal rope (') of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank (\"pārśvamāni\") and the horizontal (') <ropes> produce separately.\" Since the statement is a \"sūtra\", it is necessarily compressed and what the ropes \"produce\" is not elaborated on, but the context clearly implies the square areas constructed on their lengths, and would have been explained so by the teacher to the student.\n\nThey contain lists of Pythagorean triples, which are particular cases of Diophantine equations. They also contain statements (that with hindsight we know to be approximate) about squaring the circle and \"circling the square.\"\n\nBaudhayana (c. 8th century BCE) composed the \"Baudhayana Sulba Sutra\", the best-known \"Sulba Sutra\", which contains examples of simple Pythagorean triples, such as: , , , , and , as well as a statement of the Pythagorean theorem for the sides of a square: \"The rope which is stretched across the diagonal of a square produces an area double the size of the original square.\" It also contains the general statement of the Pythagorean theorem (for the sides of a rectangle): \"The rope stretched along the length of the diagonal of a rectangle makes an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.\" Baudhayana gives a formula for the square root of two:\nThe formula is accurate up to five decimal places, the true value being 1.41421356... This formula is similar in structure to the formula found on a Mesopotamian tablet from the Old Babylonian period (1900–1600 BCE):\nwhich expresses in the sexagesimal system, and which is also accurate up to 5 decimal places.\n\nAccording to mathematician S. G. Dani, the Babylonian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 written ca. 1850 BCE \"contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple, indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic\" in Mesopotamia in 1850 BCE. \"Since these tablets predate the Sulbasutras period by several centuries, taking into account the contextual appearance of some of the triples, it is reasonable to expect that similar understanding would have been there in India.\" Dani goes on to say:\n\nIn all, three \"Sulba Sutras\" were composed. The remaining two, the \"Manava Sulba Sutra\" composed by Manava (fl. 750–650 BCE) and the \"Apastamba Sulba Sutra\", composed by Apastamba (c. 600 BCE), contained results similar to the \"Baudhayana Sulba Sutra\".\n\nAn important landmark of the Vedic period was the work of Sanskrit grammarian, (c. 520–460 BCE). His grammar includes early use of Boolean logic, of the null operator, and of context free grammars, and includes a precursor of the Backus–Naur form (used in the description programming languages).\n\nAmong the scholars of the post-Vedic period who contributed to mathematics, the most notable is Pingala (') (fl. 300–200 BCE), a music theorist who authored the Chhandas Shastra (', also Chhandas Sutra \"\"), a Sanskrit treatise on prosody. There is evidence that in his work on the enumeration of syllabic combinations, Pingala stumbled upon both Pascal's triangle and binomial coefficients, although he did not have knowledge of the binomial theorem itself. Pingala's work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called \"maatraameru\"). Although the \"Chandah sutra\" hasn't survived in its entirety, a 10th-century commentary on it by Halāyudha has. Halāyudha, who refers to the Pascal triangle as \"Meru-prastāra\" (literally \"the staircase to Mount Meru\"), has this to say:\n\nThe text also indicates that Pingala was aware of the combinatorial identity:\n\nKātyāyana (c. 3rd century BCE) is notable for being the last of the Vedic mathematicians. He wrote the \"Katyayana Sulba Sutra\", which presented much geometry, including the general Pythagorean theorem and a computation of the square root of 2 correct to five decimal places.\n\nAlthough Jainism is a religion and philosophy predates its most famous exponent, the great Mahaviraswami (6th century BCE), most Jain texts on mathematical topics were composed after the 6th century BCE. Jain mathematicians are important historically as crucial links between the mathematics of the Vedic period and that of the \"classical period.\"\n\nA significant historical contribution of Jain mathematicians lay in their freeing Indian mathematics from its religious and ritualistic constraints. In particular, their fascination with the enumeration of very large numbers and infinities led them to classify numbers into three classes: enumerable, innumerable and infinite. Not content with a simple notion of infinity, their texts define five different types of infinity: the infinite in one direction, the infinite in two directions, the infinite in area, the infinite everywhere, and the infinite perpetually. In addition, Jain mathematicians devised notations for simple powers (and exponents) of numbers like squares and cubes, which enabled them to define simple algebraic equations (\"beejganita samikaran\"). Jain mathematicians were apparently also the first to use the word \"shunya\" (literally \"void\" in Sanskrit) to refer to zero. More than a millennium later, their appellation became the English word \"zero\" after a tortuous journey of translations and transliterations from India to Europe. (See Zero: Etymology.)\n\nIn addition to \"Surya Prajnapti\", important Jain works on mathematics included the \"Sthananga Sutra\" (c. 300 BCE – 200 CE); the \"Anuyogadwara Sutra\" (c. 200 BCE – 100 CE); and the \"Satkhandagama\" (c. 2nd century CE). Important Jain mathematicians included Bhadrabahu (d. 298 BCE), the author of two astronomical works, the \"Bhadrabahavi-Samhita\" and a commentary on the \"Surya Prajinapti\"; Yativrisham Acharya (c. 176 BCE), who authored a mathematical text called \"Tiloyapannati\"; and Umasvati (c. 150 BCE), who, although better known for his influential writings on Jain philosophy and metaphysics, composed a mathematical work called \"Tattwarthadhigama-Sutra Bhashya\".\n\nMathematicians of ancient and early medieval India were almost all Sanskrit pandits (' \"learned man\"), who were trained in Sanskrit language and literature, and possessed \"a common stock of knowledge in grammar ('), exegesis (\"\") and logic (\"nyāya\").\" Memorisation of \"what is heard\" (\"śruti\" in Sanskrit) through recitation played a major role in the transmission of sacred texts in ancient India. Memorisation and recitation was also used to transmit philosophical and literary works, as well as treatises on ritual and grammar. Modern scholars of ancient India have noted the \"truly remarkable achievements of the Indian pandits who have preserved enormously bulky texts orally for millennia.\"\n\nProdigious energy was expended by ancient Indian culture in ensuring that these texts were transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity. For example, memorisation of the sacred \"Vedas\" included up to eleven forms of recitation of the same text. The texts were subsequently \"proof-read\" by comparing the different recited versions. Forms of recitation included the \" (literally \"mesh recitation\") in which every two adjacent words in the text were first recited in their original order, then repeated in the reverse order, and finally repeated in the original order. The recitation thus proceeded as:\n\nIn another form of recitation, \" (literally \"flag recitation\") a sequence of \"N\" words were recited (and memorised) by pairing the first two and last two words and then proceeding as:\n\nThe most complex form of recitation, \"\" (literally \"dense recitation\"), according to , took the form:\n\nThat these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the \"\" (ca. 1500 BCE), as a single text, without any variant readings. Similar methods were used for memorising mathematical texts, whose transmission remained exclusively oral until the end of the Vedic period (ca. 500 BCE).\n\nMathematical activity in ancient India began as a part of a \"methodological reflexion\" on the sacred Vedas, which took the form of works called ', or, \"Ancillaries of the Veda\" (7th–4th century BCE). The need to conserve the sound of sacred text by use of ' (phonetics) and \"chhandas\" (metrics); to conserve its meaning by use of ' (grammar) and \"nirukta\" (etymology); and to correctly perform the rites at the correct time by the use of \"kalpa\" (ritual) and ' (astrology), gave rise to the six disciplines of the \". Mathematics arose as a part of the last two disciplines, ritual and astronomy (which also included astrology).\nSince the \" immediately preceded the use of writing in ancient India, they formed the last of the exclusively oral literature. They were expressed in a highly compressed mnemonic form, the \"sūtra\" (literally, \"thread\"):\n\nExtreme brevity was achieved through multiple means, which included using ellipsis \"beyond the tolerance of natural language,\" using technical names instead of longer descriptive names, abridging lists by only mentioning the first and last entries, and using markers and variables. The \"sūtras\" create the impression that communication through the text was \"only a part of the whole instruction. The rest of the instruction must have been transmitted by the so-called \"Guru-shishya parampara\", 'uninterrupted succession from teacher (\"guru\") to the student (\"śisya\"),' and it was not open to the general public\" and perhaps even kept secret. The brevity achieved in a \"sūtra\" is demonstrated in the following example from the Baudhāyana \"Śulba Sūtra\" (700 BCE).\n\nThe domestic fire-altar in the Vedic period was required by ritual to have a square base and be constituted of five layers of bricks with 21 bricks in each layer. One method of constructing the altar was to divide one side of the square into three equal parts using a cord or rope, to next divide the transverse (or perpendicular) side into seven equal parts, and thereby sub-divide the square into 21 congruent rectangles. The bricks were then designed to be of the shape of the constituent rectangle and the layer was created. To form the next layer, the same formula was used, but the bricks were arranged transversely. The process was then repeated three more times (with alternating directions) in order to complete the construction. In the Baudhāyana \"Śulba Sūtra\", this procedure is described in the following words:\n\nAccording to , the officiant constructing the altar has only a few tools and materials at his disposal: a cord (Sanskrit, \"rajju\", f.), two pegs (Sanskrit, \"śanku\", m.), and clay to make the bricks (Sanskrit, \"\", f.). Concision is achieved in the \"sūtra\", by not explicitly mentioning what the adjective \"transverse\" qualifies; however, from the feminine form of the (Sanskrit) adjective used, it is easily inferred to qualify \"cord.\" Similarly, in the second stanza, \"bricks\" are not explicitly mentioned, but inferred again by the feminine plural form of \"North-pointing.\" Finally, the first stanza, never explicitly says that the first layer of bricks are oriented in the East-West direction, but that too is implied by the explicit mention of \"North-pointing\" in the \"second\" stanza; for, if the orientation was meant to be the same in the two layers, it would either not be mentioned at all or be only mentioned in the first stanza. All these inferences are made by the officiant as he recalls the formula from his memory.\n\nWith the increasing complexity of mathematics and other exact sciences, both writing and computation were required. Consequently, many mathematical works began to be written down in manuscripts that were then copied and re-copied from generation to generation.\n\nThe earliest mathematical prose commentary was that on the work, \"\" (written 499 CE), a work on astronomy and mathematics. The mathematical portion of the ' was composed of 33 \"sūtras\" (in verse form) consisting of mathematical statements or rules, but without any proofs. However, according to , \"this does not necessarily mean that their authors did not prove them. It was probably a matter of style of exposition.\" From the time of Bhaskara I (600 CE onwards), prose commentaries increasingly began to include some derivations (\"upapatti\"). Bhaskara I's commentary on the ', had the following structure:\n\n\nTypically, for any mathematical topic, students in ancient India first memorised the \"sūtras\", which, as explained earlier, were \"deliberately inadequate\" in explanatory details (in order to pithily convey the bare-bone mathematical rules). The students then worked through the topics of the prose commentary by writing (and drawing diagrams) on chalk- and dust-boards (\"i.e.\" boards covered with dust). The latter activity, a staple of mathematical work, was to later prompt mathematician-astronomer, Brahmagupta (fl. 7th century CE), to characterise astronomical computations as \"dust work\" (Sanskrit: \"dhulikarman\").\n\nIt is well known that the decimal place-value system \"in use today\" was first recorded in India, then transmitted to the Islamic world, and eventually to Europe. The Syrian bishop Severus Sebokht wrote in the mid-7th century CE about the \"nine signs\" of the Indians for expressing numbers. However, how, when, and where the first decimal place value system was invented is not so clear.\n\nThe earliest extant script used in India was the script used in the Gandhara culture of the north-west. It is thought to be of Aramaic origin and it was in use from the 4th century BCE to the 4th century CE. Almost contemporaneously, another script, the Brāhmī script, appeared on much of the sub-continent, and would later become the foundation of many scripts of South Asia and South-east Asia. Both scripts had numeral symbols and numeral systems, which were initially \"not\" based on a place-value system.\n\nThe earliest surviving evidence of decimal place value numerals in India and southeast Asia is from the middle of the first millennium CE. A copper plate from Gujarat, India mentions the date 595 CE, written in a decimal place value notation, although there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the plate. Decimal numerals recording the years 683 CE have also been found in stone inscriptions in Indonesia and Cambodia, where Indian cultural influence was substantial.\n\nThere are older textual sources, although the extant manuscript copies of these texts are from much later dates. Probably the earliest such source is the work of the Buddhist philosopher Vasumitra dated likely to the 1st century CE. Discussing the counting pits of merchants, Vasumitra remarks, \"When [the same] clay counting-piece is in the place of units, it is denoted as one, when in hundreds, one hundred.\" Although such references seem to imply that his readers had knowledge of a decimal place value representation, the \"brevity of their allusions and the ambiguity of their dates, however, do not solidly establish the chronology of the development of this concept.\"\n\nA third decimal representation was employed in a verse composition technique, later labelled \"Bhuta-sankhya\" (literally, \"object numbers\") used by early Sanskrit authors of technical books. Since many early technical works were composed in verse, numbers were often represented by objects in the natural or religious world that correspondence to them; this allowed a many-to-one correspondence for each number and made verse composition easier. According to , the number 4, for example, could be represented by the word \"Veda\" (since there were four of these religious texts), the number 32 by the word \"teeth\" (since a full set consists of 32), and the number 1 by \"moon\" (since there is only one moon). So, Veda/teeth/moon would correspond to the decimal numeral 1324, as the convention for numbers was to enumerate their digits from right to left. The earliest reference employing object numbers is a ca. 269 CE Sanskrit text, \"Yavanajātaka\" (literally \"Greek horoscopy\") of Sphujidhvaja, a versification of an earlier (ca. 150 CE) Indian prose adaptation of a lost work of Hellenistic astrology. Such use seems to make the case that by the mid-3rd century CE, the decimal place value system was familiar, at least to readers of astronomical and astrological texts in India.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the Indian decimal place value system was based on the symbols used on Chinese counting boards from as early as the middle of the first millennium BCE. According to , These counting boards, like the Indian counting pits, ..., had a decimal place value structure ... Indians may well have learned of these decimal place value \"rod numerals\" from Chinese Buddhist pilgrims or other travelers, or they may have developed the concept independently from their earlier non-place-value system; no documentary evidence survives to confirm either conclusion.\"\n\nThe oldest extant mathematical manuscript in India is the \"Bakhshali Manuscript\", a birch bark manuscript written in \"Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit\" in the \"Śāradā\" script, which was used in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent between the 8th and 12th centuries CE. The manuscript was discovered in 1881 by a farmer while digging in a stone enclosure in the village of Bakhshali, near Peshawar (then in British India and now in Pakistan). Of unknown authorship and now preserved in the Bodleian Library in Oxford University, the manuscript has been variously dated—sometimes as early as the \"early centuries of the Christian era.\" The 7th century CE is now considered a plausible date.\n\nThe surviving manuscript has seventy leaves, some of which are in fragments. Its mathematical content consists of rules and examples, written in verse, together with prose commentaries, which include solutions to the examples. The topics treated include arithmetic (fractions, square roots, profit and loss, simple interest, the rule of three, and \"regula falsi\") and algebra (simultaneous linear equations and quadratic equations), and arithmetic progressions. In addition, there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also \"employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero.\" Many of its problems are of a category known as 'equalisation problems' that lead to systems of linear equations. One example from Fragment III-5-3v is the following:\n\nThe prose commentary accompanying the example solves the problem by converting it to three (under-determined) equations in four unknowns and assuming that the prices are all integers.\n\nIn 2017, three samples from the manuscript were shown by radiocarbon dating to come from three different centuries: from 224-383 AD, 680-779 AD, and 885-993 AD. It is not known how fragments from different centuries came to be packaged together.\n\nThis period is often known as the golden age of Indian Mathematics. This period saw mathematicians such as Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara I, Mahavira, Bhaskara II, Madhava of Sangamagrama and Nilakantha Somayaji give broader and clearer shape to many branches of mathematics. Their contributions would spread to Asia, the Middle East, and eventually to Europe. Unlike Vedic mathematics, their works included both astronomical and mathematical contributions. In fact, mathematics of that period was included in the 'astral science' (\"jyotiḥśāstra\") and consisted of three sub-disciplines: mathematical sciences (\"gaṇita\" or \"tantra\"), horoscope astrology (\"horā\" or \"jātaka\") and divination (saṃhitā). This tripartite division is seen in Varāhamihira's 6th century compilation—\"Pancasiddhantika\" (literally \"panca\", \"five,\" \"siddhānta\", \"conclusion of deliberation\", dated 575 CE)—of five earlier works, Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta and Paitamaha Siddhanta, which were adaptations of still earlier works of Mesopotamian, Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy. As explained earlier, the main texts were composed in Sanskrit verse, and were followed by prose commentaries.\n\n\nThough its authorship is unknown, the \"Surya Siddhanta\" (c. 400) contains the roots of modern trigonometry. Because it contains many words of foreign origin, some authors consider that it was written under the influence of Mesopotamia and Greece.\n\nThis ancient text uses the following as trigonometric functions for the first time:\n\nIt also contains the earliest uses of:\n\nLater Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\nThis Chhedi calendar (594) contains an early use of the modern place-value Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally.\n\n\nAryabhata (476–550) wrote the \"Aryabhatiya.\" He described the important fundamental principles of mathematics in 332 shlokas. The treatise contained:\n\nAryabhata also wrote the \"Arya Siddhanta\", which is now lost. Aryabhata's contributions include:\n\nTrigonometry:\n\n\nArithmetic:\n\nAlgebra:\n\nMathematical astronomy:\n\n\nVarahamihira (505–587) produced the \"Pancha Siddhanta\" (\"The Five Astronomical Canons\"). He made important contributions to trigonometry, including sine and cosine tables to 4 decimal places of accuracy and the following formulas relating sine and cosine functions:\n\n\nIn the 7th century, two separate fields, arithmetic (which included measurement) and algebra, began to emerge in Indian mathematics. The two fields would later be called ' (literally \"mathematics of algorithms\") and ' (lit. \"mathematics of seeds,\" with \"seeds\"—like the seeds of plants—representing unknowns with the potential to generate, in this case, the solutions of equations). Brahmagupta, in his astronomical work \"\" (628 CE), included two chapters (12 and 18) devoted to these fields. Chapter 12, containing 66 Sanskrit verses, was divided into two sections: \"basic operations\" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and \"practical mathematics\" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain). In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral:\n\nBrahmagupta's theorem: If a cyclic quadrilateral has diagonals that are perpendicular to each other, then the perpendicular line drawn from the point of intersection of the diagonals to any side of the quadrilateral always bisects the opposite side.\n\nChapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalisation of Heron's formula), as well as a complete description of rational triangles (\"i.e.\" triangles with rational sides and rational areas).\n\nBrahmagupta's formula: The area, \"A\", of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides of lengths \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", respectively, is given by\n\nwhere \"s\", the semiperimeter, given by formula_8\n\nBrahmagupta's Theorem on rational triangles: A triangle with rational sides formula_9 and rational area is of the form:\n\nfor some rational numbers formula_11 and formula_12.\n\nChapter 18 contained 103 Sanskrit verses which began with rules for arithmetical operations involving zero and negative numbers and is considered the first systematic treatment of the subject. The rules (which included formula_13 and formula_14) were all correct, with one exception: formula_15. Later in the chapter, he gave the first explicit (although still not completely general) solution of the quadratic equation:\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nAlso in chapter 18, Brahmagupta was able to make progress in finding (integral) solutions of Pell's equation,\nwhere formula_19 is a nonsquare integer. He did this by discovering the following identity:\n\nBrahmagupta's Identity: formula_20\nwhich was a generalisation of an earlier identity of Diophantus: Brahmagupta used his identity to prove the following lemma:\n\nLemma (Brahmagupta): If formula_21 is a solution of formula_22 and,\nformula_23 is a solution of formula_24, then:\n\nHe then used this lemma to both generate infinitely many (integral) solutions of Pell's equation, given one solution, and state the following theorem:\n\nTheorem (Brahmagupta): If the equation formula_27 has an integer solution for any one of formula_28 then Pell's equation:\nalso has an integer solution.\n\nBrahmagupta did not actually prove the theorem, but rather worked out examples using his method. The first example he presented was:\n\nExample (Brahmagupta): Find integers formula_30 such that:\nIn his commentary, Brahmagupta added, \"a person solving this problem within a year is a mathematician.\" The solution he provided was:\n\n\nBhaskara I (c. 600–680) expanded the work of Aryabhata in his books titled \"Mahabhaskariya\", \"Aryabhatiya-bhashya\" and \"Laghu-bhaskariya\". He produced:\n\n\nVirasena (8th century) was a Jain mathematician in the court of Rashtrakuta King Amoghavarsha of Manyakheta, Karnataka. He wrote the \"Dhavala\", a commentary on Jain mathematics, which:\nVirasena also gave:\nIt is thought that much of the mathematical material in the \"Dhavala\" can attributed to previous writers, especially Kundakunda, Shamakunda, Tumbulura, Samantabhadra and Bappadeva and date who wrote between 200 and 600 CE.\n\n\nMahavira Acharya (c. 800–870) from Karnataka, the last of the notable Jain mathematicians, lived in the 9th century and was patronised by the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha. He wrote a book titled \"Ganit Saar Sangraha\" on numerical mathematics, and also wrote treatises about a wide range of mathematical topics. These include the mathematics of:\n\nMahavira also:\n\n\nShridhara (c. 870–930), who lived in Bengal, wrote the books titled \"Nav Shatika\", \"Tri Shatika\" and \"Pati Ganita\". He gave:\n\nThe \"Pati Ganita\" is a work on arithmetic and measurement. It deals with various operations, including:\n\n\nAryabhata's differential equations were elaborated in the 10th century by Manjula (also \"Munjala\"), who realised that the expression\n\ncould be approximately expressed as\n\nHe understood the concept of differentiation after solving the differential equation that resulted from substituting this expression into Aryabhata's differential equation.\n\n\nAryabhata II (c. 920–1000) wrote a commentary on Shridhara, and an astronomical treatise \"Maha-Siddhanta\". The Maha-Siddhanta has 18 chapters, and discusses:\n\n\nShripati Mishra (1019–1066) wrote the books \"Siddhanta Shekhara\", a major work on astronomy in 19 chapters, and \"Ganit Tilaka\", an incomplete arithmetical treatise in 125 verses based on a work by Shridhara. He worked mainly on:\n\nHe was also the author of \"Dhikotidakarana\", a work of twenty verses on:\n\nThe \"Dhruvamanasa\" is a work of 105 verses on:\n\n\nNemichandra Siddhanta Chakravati (c. 1100) authored a mathematical treatise titled \"Gome-mat Saar\".\n\n\nBhāskara II (1114–1185) was a mathematician-astronomer who wrote a number of important treatises, namely the \"Siddhanta Shiromani\", \"Lilavati\", \"Bijaganita\", \"Gola Addhaya\", \"Griha Ganitam\" and \"Karan Kautoohal\". A number of his contributions were later transmitted to the Middle East and Europe. His contributions include:\n\nArithmetic:\n\nAlgebra:\n\nGeometry:\n\nCalculus:\n\nTrigonometry:\n\nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics was founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, South India and included among its members: Parameshvara, Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyeshtadeva, Achyuta Pisharati, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri and Achyuta Panikkar. It flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559–1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school astronomers \"independently\" created a number of important mathematics concepts. The most important results, series expansion for trigonometric functions, were given in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta called \"Tantrasangraha\" and a commentary on this work called \"Tantrasangraha-vakhya\" of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for \"sine\", \"cosine\", and inverse \"tangent\" were provided a century later in the work \"Yuktibhāṣā\" (c.1500–c.1610), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva, and also in a commentary on \"Tantrasangraha\".\n\nTheir discovery of these three important series expansions of calculus—several centuries before calculus was developed in Europe by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz—was an achievement. However, the Kerala School did not invent \"calculus\", because, while they were able to develop Taylor series expansions for the important trigonometric functions, differentiation, term by term integration, convergence tests, iterative methods for solutions of non-linear equations, and the theory that the area under a curve is its integral, they developed neither a theory of differentiation or integration, nor the fundamental theorem of calculus. The results obtained by the Kerala school include:\n\n\nThe works of the Kerala school were first written up for the Western world by Englishman C.M. Whish in 1835. According to Whish, the Kerala mathematicians had \"\"laid the foundation for a complete system of fluxions\"\" and these works abounded \"\"with fluxional forms and series to be found in no work of foreign countries.\"\"\n\nHowever, Whish's results were almost completely neglected, until over a century later, when the discoveries of the Kerala school were investigated again by C. Rajagopal and his associates. Their work includes commentaries on the proofs of the arctan series in \"Yuktibhāṣā\" given in two papers, a commentary on the \"Yuktibhāṣā\"'s proof of the sine and cosine series and two papers that provide the Sanskrit verses of the \"Tantrasangrahavakhya\" for the series for arctan, sin, and cosine (with English translation and commentary).\n\nThe Kerala mathematicians included Narayana Pandit (c. 1340–1400), who composed two works, an arithmetical treatise, \"Ganita Kaumudi\", and an algebraic treatise, \"Bijganita Vatamsa\". Narayana is also thought to be the author of an elaborate commentary of Bhaskara II's Lilavati, titled \"Karmapradipika\" (or \"Karma-Paddhati\"). Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340–1425) was the founder of the Kerala School. Although it is possible that he wrote \"Karana Paddhati\" a work written sometime between 1375 and 1475, all we really know of his work comes from works of later scholars.\n\nParameshvara (c. 1370–1460) wrote commentaries on the works of Bhaskara I, Aryabhata and Bhaskara II. His \"Lilavati Bhasya\", a commentary on Bhaskara II's \"Lilavati\", contains one of his important discoveries: a version of the mean value theorem. Nilakantha Somayaji (1444–1544) composed the \"Tantra Samgraha\" (which 'spawned' a later anonymous commentary \"Tantrasangraha-vyakhya\" and a further commentary by the name \"Yuktidipaika\", written in 1501). He elaborated and extended the contributions of Madhava.\n\nCitrabhanu (c. 1530) was a 16th-century mathematician from Kerala who gave integer solutions to 21 types of systems of two simultaneous algebraic equations in two unknowns. These types are all the possible pairs of equations of the following seven forms:\n\nFor each case, Citrabhanu gave an explanation and justification of his rule as well as an example. Some of his explanations are algebraic, while others are geometric. Jyesthadeva (c. 1500–1575) was another member of the Kerala School. His key work was the \"Yukti-bhāṣā\" (written in Malayalam, a regional language of Kerala). Jyesthadeva presented proofs of most mathematical theorems and infinite series earlier discovered by Madhava and other Kerala School mathematicians.\n\nIt has been suggested that Indian contributions to mathematics have not been given due acknowledgement in modern history and that many discoveries and inventions by Indian mathematicians are presently culturally attributed to their Western counterparts, as a result of Eurocentrism. According to G. G. Joseph's take on \"Ethnomathematics\":\n\n[Their work] takes on board some of the objections raised about the classical Eurocentric trajectory. The awareness [of Indian and Arabic mathematics] is all too likely to be tempered with dismissive rejections of their importance compared to Greek mathematics. The contributions from other civilisations – most notably China and India, are perceived either as borrowers from Greek sources or having made only minor contributions to mainstream mathematical development. An openness to more recent research findings, especially in the case of Indian and Chinese mathematics, is sadly missing\"\n\nThe historian of mathematics, Florian Cajori, suggested that he and others \"suspect that Diophantus got his first glimpse of algebraic knowledge from India.\" However, he also wrote that \"it is certain that portions of Hindu mathematics are of Greek origin\".\n\nMore recently, as discussed in the above section, the infinite series of calculus for trigonometric functions (rediscovered by Gregory, Taylor, and Maclaurin in the late 17th century) were described (with proofs and formulas for truncation error) in India, by mathematicians of the Kerala school, remarkably some two centuries earlier. Some scholars have recently suggested that knowledge of these results might have been transmitted to Europe through the trade route from Kerala by traders and Jesuit missionaries. Kerala was in continuous contact with China and Arabia, and, from around 1500, with Europe. The existence of communication routes and a suitable chronology certainly make such a transmission a possibility. However, there is no direct evidence by way of relevant manuscripts that such a transmission actually took place. According to David Bressoud, \"there is no evidence that the Indian work of series was known beyond India, or even outside of Kerala, until the nineteenth century.\"\n\nBoth Arab and Indian scholars made discoveries before the 17th century that are now considered a part of calculus. However, they did not, as Newton and Leibniz did, \"combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the great problem-solving tool we have today.\" The intellectual careers of both Newton and Leibniz are well-documented and there is no indication of their work not being their own; however, it is not known with certainty whether the immediate \"predecessors\" of Newton and Leibniz, \"including, in particular, Fermat and Roberval, learned of some of the ideas of the Islamic and Indian mathematicians through sources we are not now aware.\" This is an active area of current research, especially in the manuscript collections of Spain and Maghreb. This research is being pursued, among other places, at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Paris.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1848075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848075", "title": "Ramaz School", "text": "Ramaz School\n\nThe Ramaz School is a coeducational Jewish Modern Orthodox Day School, which offers a dual curriculum of general studies taught in English and Judaic studies taught in Hebrew. The school is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It consists of an early childhood center (nursery-kindergarten), a lower school (1st-4th grade), a middle school (5th-8th grade), and an upper school (9th-12th grade).\n\nThe Ramaz Upper School is a college preparatory program, designed to develop an appreciation for and understanding of the intellectual disciplines that are part of western civilization. The Judaic studies curriculum provides an equally rigorous program through which the religious and cultural tradition of Judaism is both taught and experienced. It is located on East 78th Street, seven city blocks (0.5 km) away from the other two school buildings, located on East 85th Street. Approximately fifty percent of the Upper School student body advances from the Middle School, as well as daily commuters from the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester, and Nassau counties in New York; Stamford and New Haven in Connecticut; from all over metropolitan New Jersey; and on a weekly or longer basis from more distant communities.\n\nRamaz was founded in 1937 and is affiliated with Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun (\"KJ\"), a synagogue located on East 85th Street, which shares a building with the lower school and is across the street from the middle school. The congregation and its rabbi, Joseph Lookstein, helped to found and finance the school.\n\nArchitect James Rossant designed the modernist Upper School building, completed in 1981.\n\nFounded in 1937 by Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein through the generosity of New York lawyer and philanthropist Max J. Etra, Ramaz takes its name from the initials of Rabbi Moses Zevulun Margolies, the grandfather-in-law of Lookstein. The current principal, Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, is the son of Joseph Lookstein and was a member of the first class of six students.\n\nClasses were held in many locations over the years, including the vestry rooms of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun. After the closing of Finch College, Ramaz bought the college's campus and renovated the buildings.\n\nIn 2007, Joyce Villarin, a former nurse at the school, treated a child for an injury that he claimed his father caused. Villarin contacted the father who admitted to injuring his son. The Ramaz administration told Villarin not to report the incident to the police. Villarin did report this and was fired in 2008 because the school thought that she was \"not a team player.\" Villarin sued the school in Manhattan Supreme Court in 2009, arguing that the state's Social Services Law obligated her to report the potential abuse. Under the law, school faculty are required to report to state authorities a suspicion that a child is being abused or mistreated.\n\nOn November 30, 2007, \"The Wall Street Journal\" listed Ramaz as one of the top schools for graduates entering the top eight universities in the country, with 10 out of a class of 100 (class of 2007) going to these schools.\n\nIn January 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ramaz lost $6 million in the collapse of the Bernard Madoff investment scheme.\n\nThe Ramaz School had proposed a 28-story project to be built in place of the Lower School during 2008–2010. The building would have replaced the current school with a new building split into ten floors used by the school and topped by 18 floors of condominiums. Air rights of the adjoining synagogue would be transferred for use by the adjoining school/condo structure. The project may have had to be scaled back following a review by the City's Board of Standards & Appeals because the height is more than what is permitted at this site. The plans were withdrawn by the school in July 2008. However, due to a fire in the adjacent Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun building in July 2011, the Lower school began to undergo repairs and refurbishments for water damage. Since the building was not ready to welcome students that September, the Temple Emanu-El of New York and Park Avenue Synagogue volunteered their facilities for students until November 2011. On November 8, 2011, the Lower school reopened its doors.\n\nThe Ramaz School's team name is the Ramaz Rams, and their logo is a Ram's head. Ramaz fields a number of competitive and recreational athletic teams throughout the school year. In the Upper School, there are varsity teams for both boys and girls in basketball, tennis, volleyball, and hockey, these teams compete in both the Yeshiva High School Athletic League and local independent school leagues. Ramaz also fields soccer, baseball, swim, table tennis, and track teams.\n\nRamaz's academic teams include their Mock Trial team, which competes in the New York State Bar Association's statewide competition and won the New York State competition in 2002, the New York City competition four times, and were finalists or semi-finalists an additional six times. Ramaz's Model Congress team participates in the University of Pennsylvania Model Congress tournament, and their Model UN team competes in the annual Yeshiva University National Model United Nations event. Additionally, Ramaz's College Bowl team participates in independent tournaments, their Math Team competes in the New York Math League and the Mandelbrot Competition, the Chess Club competes in the Yeshiva Chess League, the Science Olympiad team competes against 15 other New York and New Jersey schools in a competition administered by the Board of Jewish Education, and their Hidon HaTanakh and Torah Bowl teams compete against local Jewish Day Schools. Ramaz Upper School students have also succeeded in numerous academic competitions in both the arts and sciences, including the 2004–2005 Siemens Westinghouse Competition, the 2007 NCTE Achievement Awards in Writing, the Intel Science Competition, and the American Mathematics Competition.\n\nIn addition to their athletic and academic teams, the Ramaz Upper School also has 22 special interest clubs, including an Arabic Club, Coalition for the Homeless, and Israel Advocacy Club that regularly attends the annual AIPAC Policy Conference, in addition to 15 fine and performing arts clubs. Ramaz's esteemed business investment club(BIC) has produced a significant amount of hedge fund managers. The Ramaz Chamber Choir has competed in national choral competitions, performed on \"CBS Sunday Morning News\", and at the White House and is featured on the \"Best of Jewish A Cappella, Volume 3\".\n\n\n"}

Before his parliamentary career, he served as a councillor for Headingley. He served as a Liberal Democrat spokesman for Health, Schools and International Development.\n\nAt the 2017 general election he lost his seat to Alex Sobel of the Labour Party.\n\nBorn in Manchester, Mulholland attended St. Ambrose College near Altrincham and studied politics at the University of York, going on to achieve an MA in Public Administration and Public Policy. While at York University he played at centre for the university rugby league team in matches against Bradford, Leeds, Manchester and Hull. He then worked in marketing for five years, including two years spent in Edinburgh, working on several national promotional campaigns.\n\nHis first experience in politics was canvassing in the Knowsley North by-election in 1986, while studying politics for A-level.\n\nHe had a long-standing interest and involvement in international development, trade justice and debt campaigns. He was an active member of the campaigning groups Trade Injustice and Debt Action Leeds (TIDAL) and Catholic Aid For Overseas Development (CAFOD).\n\nIn 2003, he was elected as a Leeds City Councillor for Headingley ward. From 2004 to 2005 he was the lead member for corporate services, until his election to Parliament in 2005. He was also the Liberal Democrat group's spokesperson on the Leeds Supertram, approval for which was turned down in 2006.\n\nMulholland was elected to Parliament at the 2005 general election for the constituency of Leeds North West. This West Yorkshire constituency extends from inner-city Leeds through suburban and rural areas to the towns of Otley and Yeadon.\n\nThe seat had been held by the Conservative party from 1950 to 1997 and by the Labour party from 1997 to 2005. In the general election of 2010 the seat was retained by the Liberal Democrats with an increased majority. In the 2015 general election the seat was again retained by the Liberal Democrats, leaving Mulholland as one of eight Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament.\n\nIn the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership election Mulholland backed Chris Huhne, who eventually finished second behind Menzies Campbell. In the 2007 Liberal Democrat leadership election he supported Nick Clegg. In the 2015 Liberal Democrat leadership election Mulholland backed Tim Farron \n\nIn the 2017 general election Mulholland lost his seat to Labour's Alex Sobel, who gained a majority of 4,224.\n\nAfter his election to Parliament, he was appointed his party's junior International Development spokesperson from 2005 to 2006. In 2006 he was appointed Shadow Spokesperson on Schools, and in 2007 he became Shadow Spokesperson on Health. He was also a member of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee.\n\nMulholland is a member of 27 all-party parliamentary groups including 4 as chair or co-chair and 7 as vice chair.\n\nDuring and after the 2009 expenses scandal, Greg Mulholland's expense claims were generally without controversy and he was described as an angel by the Telegraph after he called for stricter regulations. He did, however, have two claims rejected: for a cot and playpen, then later to have photographs reframed. Mulholland was the MP with the highest expense claims in the 2011–12 financial year.\n\nIn November 2005, Mulholland proposed the Sale of Green Belt Land Bill to prevent 'land banking' (property speculation in Green Belt land). However, the bill did not receive a second reading and was dropped without becoming law.\n\nAs a Roman Catholic, Mulholland describes himself as holding 'pro-life' views and has a strong voting record against abortion, embryology and euthanasia. Mulholland is one of three Liberal Democrat MPs to have supported MP Nadine Dorries's attempts to reduce the number of weeks at which a woman can legally have an abortion.\n\nAccording to ThePublicWhip.org, as of February 2013, Greg Mulholland has supported the Coalition Government 91.6% of the time in the 2010 Parliament.\n\nMulholland took part in a community campaign in his constituency against further cuts at the Wharfedale Hospital in Otley. He called a public meeting at which he presented a 5,000-signature petition to Parliament after one ward was closed. He has also campaigned alongside other Leeds MPs for a new children's hospital in the city, questioning the then Prime Minister Tony Blair over the issue at Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nHe faced criticism for aspects of this campaign. An article in a Liberal Democrat \"Focus\" leaflet featuring Mulholland and distributed in Leeds claimed that the government had axed plans to build a new £204 million Children's Hospital at St. James's, which had been backed by all the city's MPs. The Government claimed that this was untrue and that the decision had been made by the Leeds Hospital Trust without the Government's prior knowledge. Caroline Flint, Minister of State for Public Health, described the statement as: \"taking political grandstanding too far. The article is not true, it is a complete misrepresentation.\"\n\nGreg Mulholland is an active campaigner for Save the Pub, an all party parliamentary group which aims to preserve and protect the Great British pub. In 2012, the group celebrated three years of success with the introduction of a special \"Save the Pub Ale\".\n\nMulholland set up a rugby league team called \"Political Animals\", based at Westminster, to bring greater prominence and attention to rugby league within Parliament. He plays left wing for the team. He is also a Vice President of the Leeds Rugby Foundation charity.\n\nMulholland was criticised for calling a constituent a \"disingenuous, manipulative, illiberal shit\" over Twitter in response to the constituent's comments on his vote in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. The constituent's earlier message had said \"After abstaining, voting for a wrecking amendment, then trying to abolish marriage, I'm glad @GregMulholland1 finally voted the right way\". Mulholland said he supported same sex marriage but believed there were flaws in the legislation, and was frustrated at being misrepresented.\n\nIn 2007, he was nominated for best campaigning politician in the Channel 4 Political Awards for helping to secure the release of Mirza Tahir Hussain from prison in Pakistan. He has tabled Early Day Motions on a variety of subjects including support for small breweries, winter fuel payments for the severely disabled under 60, and against biometric data collection in schools.\n\nIn 2008, Mulholland was recorded describing health minister Ivan Lewis as an \"arsehole\" after Lewis refused to let him intervene in a Westminster Hall debate on hospice funding. He later publicly defended his comment.\n\nMulholland has also been active in seeking to expose companies which wish to move out of the Leeds area to reduce costs. In 2011 he tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling for a boycott of brands owned by Carlsberg due to their brewery being moved from Leeds.\n\nIn September 2018 Mulholland announced that he would not be standing for election to Parliament in the next general election. He described the shock of losing his seat in the unexpected 2017 election, when \"just eight weeks later I had lost my job, my career, our family income and actually to a great extent, my identity\". He is establishing himself as a \"specialist campaigning and public affairs consultant\" and political campaigning would be incompatible with that role. He did not rule out the possibility of standing for Parliament again, but \"only if we see real change in British politics\". He would also devote more time to his band Summercross, whose album \"My Northern Heart\" was nearing completion. It was subsequently announced that Kamran Hussain had been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Leeds North West. Hussain said \"Greg Mulholland was a brilliant MP. He was hard working, focused on the constituency, and I would like to emulate his work\".\n\nIn August 2019 the album \"My Northern Heart\", with 12 songs written by Mulholland and performed by his band Summercross, was reported to be \"Set to be released in the next few weeks\". The songs refer to topics including the construction of the Bramhope Tunnel, the suicide of Big Country singer Stuart Adamson, the campaign for the restoration of hire boats on the River Wharfe at Otley, and Mulholland's campaigning work for community pubs.\n\nHe is married and has three daughters. The family lives in Otley.\n\nIn 2009, he completed the Belfast marathon in 3 hrs 18 mins 50 secs and the \"Wessex 100 mile\" walk in 38 hrs 24 mins, as a \"126 mile challenge\" to raise money for local charities, along with Otley & Yeadon councillor Ryk Downes and university lecturer Martin Rivett.\n\n"}

Starring Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel and Bill Murray, it tells the story of an alcoholic ex-professional bowler (Harrelson) who becomes the manager for a promising Amish talent (Quaid). It was filmed in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a stand-in for Scranton; Amish country; and Reno, Nevada.\n\nFlashy young bowler Roy Munson wins the 1979 Iowa state bowling championship and leaves home to turn professional. In his professional bowling tour debut, he defeats established pro Ernie McCracken, who takes the loss poorly and seeks revenge. McCracken convinces Roy to join him in hustling a group of local amateur bowlers. When the amateurs become furious after realizing they are being conned, McCracken flees while Roy is brutally beaten and loses his hand when it is forced into the ball return, ending his career. Seventeen years later, Roy uses a prosthetic hand and is living in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as an alcoholic, unsuccessful traveling salesman of bowling supplies. He is always behind on his rent and is constantly harassed by his landlady, Mrs. Dumars, eventually being reduced to trade sexual favors with her for a break on his back rent.\n\nOn a sales visit to a nearby bowling alley, Roy meets Ishmael Boorg. Roy tries to convince Ishmael to turn pro, with Roy acting as manager. Ishmael declines, explaining that he is from the local Amish community and that his bowling hobby is a secret and must hide it from his family. Roy then sees a poster in a bowling magazine advertising a $1 million winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada. Learning that Ishmael's family is about to lose their farm to the bank, Roy eventually convinces Ishmael's family to let him join Roy.\n\nRoy discovers that the childlike Ishmael is not aware of some of bowling's basic rules and skills. (His 270 average was because he was taught to bowl fifteen frames and not the standard ten.) However, after some coaching, Ishmael improves. The duo earn money in various local tournaments and by hustling bowlers. Ishmael defeats a wealthy bowling enthusiast named Stanley Osmanski, but Stanley attacks the duo after discovering that the roll of cash Roy put up was fake. As the group flee Osmanski's mansion, his girlfriend Claudia, who had also been a victim of Osmanski's violence, joins them. Roy suspects Claudia has ulterior motives and is distracting Ishmael. After Roy gets in a fistfight with her, Ishmael flees. During his absence, Roy and Claudia drive on and end up back in Roy's hometown and at his childhood home, which has been abandoned ever since his father died years earlier. Roy then confesses to Claudia he never returned for his father's funeral out of shame for his failure as a pro bowler. They eventually find Ishmael and continue on to Reno.\n\nIn Reno, the group runs into McCracken, who is now a national bowling superstar. McCracken insults and makes fun of Roy and infuriates Ishmael, who attempts to punch McCracken but instead hits a wall and breaks his hand, leaving him unable to bowl. Later on, Claudia disappears with all of their money after being discovered by Stanley. Feeling distraught, Ishmael convinces Roy that they still have a chance to win $1 million if Roy bowls. Roy enters the tournament, rolling the ball with his prosthetic rubber hand. He wins his first several rounds, ending up in the televised finals against McCracken. During the final match, Ishmael's brother, who had been sent by the Boorg family, arrives and takes Ishmael back to Pennsylvania. When Roy realizes he is alone, he struggles and McCracken wins the tournament by one pin.\n\nAfterwards, Roy has returned to his Pennsylvania apartment, and is seen pouring his liquor down the drain, when he is visited by Claudia, who explains she had disappeared with Stanley in Reno to keep him from hurting Roy and Ishmael. She made Stanley believe she was running away with McCracken and give McCracken payback off-screen, and confesses her love for Roy, offering him money Stanley earned from gambling on McCracken in the finals. Roy responds that he is going to make $500,000 in an endorsement deal for Trojan condoms based on his prosthetic rubber hand. Roy and Claudia visit Ishmael's family home. Ishmael's parents explain that Roy and Claudia told them about Ishmael's forbidden bowling career, but also about the moral strength and decency he showed during his travels. Roy tells them how Ishmael straightened out Roy and Claudia's lives, with Roy shown to have finally given up drinking. Roy pays off the Boorg family's debts with his endorsement check, and Roy and Claudia drive away together.\n\n\nCast notes:\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a 50% approval rating based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.72/10. The site's consensus, \"\"Kingpin\" has its moments, but they're often offset by an eagerness to descend into vulgar mean-spiritedness.\" On Metacritic, based on 14 reviews, the film holds a score of 43 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nRoger Ebert had one of the more noteworthy positive reviews, giving it 3.5 out of 4 stars. Gene Siskel also endorsed the film, putting it on his list of the ten best films for 1996.\n\nNancy Gerstman mentioned the film as one of the nine most underrated films in the 1990s.\nThe film is ranked #68 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". \nIn 2018 Vulture.com listed it at #2 on a list of Woody Harrelson's best films.\n\nWhen released on DVD, \"Kingpin\" came in its original PG-13 theatrical version (113 minutes) and an extended, R-rated version (117 minutes). Both versions are available on the Blu-Ray disc issued by Paramount Pictures on October 14, 2014.\n\nLin Shaye attended a 1996 live airing of a Professional Bowlers Tour event in Wichita, Kansas, to both promote the film and present the winner (Jess Stayrook) with the winner's trophy and prize money.

It is sometimes spelled arak, or simply referred to as 'rack or 'rak. It is not to be confused with the anise-flavored distilled spirit called Arak or Araq.\n\nThere are two primary styles of Arrack that are very different from one another: \"Batavia Arrack\" is often clear in color but has a flavor profile more similar to dark rum, with a distinctive \"funk\" or \"hogo\" imparted to it from fermented red rice. \"Ceylon Arrack\", by contrast, is a more refined and subtle spirit. It has hints of Cognac and rum character and a wealth of delicate floral notes. Both styles are also made \"in house\" by local citizenry and can be more akin to moonshine in their presentation.\n\nArrack predates all \"New World\" spirits, as it is a parent to aguardiente (which was, in turn, the parent of rum, rhum agricole, and ron). Genoese merchants made the spirit as a byproduct of their sugar cane production in the Canary Islands. Besides making sugar, they produced arrack instead of importing it for their growing list of customers. Other early arrack was distilled from molasses and water, using dried cakes of red rice and botanicals that contain yeast and other fungi to trigger the fermentation process (this technique can be traced back thousands of years to China and even predates the birth of distillation). It is also claimed to have been distilled in India in 800 BC, but while palm wine and fermented sugar-cane drinks were being made around this time period not all believe that formal distillation was taking place.\n\nOutside Asia, the spirit was a common ingredient in the proliferation of Indian alcoholic punch, and was particularly popular in Holland and Sweden. It was first drunk in the United States prior to prohibition, but is now mostly confused with the more common and similar spelled anise-flavored spirit arak.\n\nRegardless of the exact origin, arrack has come to symbolize a multitude of largely unrelated, distilled alcohols produced throughout Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. This is largely due to the proliferation of distillation knowledge throughout the Middle East during the 14th century. Each country named its own alcohol by using various Latin alphabet forms of the same word which was synonymous with distillation at the time (\"arak, araka, araki, ariki, arrack, arack, raki, raque, racque, rac, rak\"). 1864 English and Australian Cookery Book described Arrack as \"a spirituous liquor from the East Indies. This term, or its corruption, rack, is applied to any spirituous liquor in the East. The true arrack is said to be distilled from \"toddy\", the fermented juice of the coconut flower.It is however, frequently distilled from rice and sugar, fermented with the cocoa-nut juice.\"\n\nArrack was banned in the states of Kerala in 1996, and Karnataka on 1 July 2007.\nWithin Indonesia itself, the term \"arak\" is still widely used to describe arrack. Arak (or rice wine) was a popular alcoholic beverage during the colonial era. It is considered the \"rum\" of Indonesia because, like rum, it is distilled from sugarcane. It is a pot still distillation. To start the fermentation, local fermented red rice is combined with local yeast to give a unique flavor and smell of the distillate. It is distilled to approx. 70% ABV. Like rum, Batavia-arrack is often a blend of different original parcels.\n\nOne of the longest established arack companies in Indonesia is the \"Batavia Arak Company\" (Dutch \"Batavia-Arak Maatschappij\"), which was already in business by 1872, became a limited liability company in 1901, and was still operating in the early 1950s. The Batavia Arak Company also exported arack to the Netherlands and had an office in Amsterdam. Some of the arrack brand produced by Batavia Arak Company were KWT (produced in the Bandengan (Kampung Baru) area of old Jakarta) and OGL. Still commonly available in Northern Europe and Southern Asia, Batavia Arrack can be difficult to find in the United States. \"Batavia-Arrack van Oosten\" is a more recently available brand.\n\nBatavia-Arrack is said to enhance flavor when used as a component in other products, such as pastries (like the Scandinavian Runeberg torte or the Dresdner Stollen), or in the confectionery and flavor industries. It is used in herbal and bitter liqueurs, and as a component in alcoholic punches (such as punsch, regent punch, royal punch, and black tea-port milk punch).\n\nIts use in punch was noted by early American bartender Jerry Thomas: \"Most of the arrack imported into this country is distilled from rice, and comes from Batavia. It is but little used in America, except to flavor punch; the taste of it is very agreeable in this mixture. Arrack improves very much with age. It is much used in some parts of India, where it is distilled from toddy, the juice of the coconut tree\".\n\nIn Indonesia, arrack is often created as a form of moonshine.\n\nA Filipino term for distilled and undistilled alcoholic drinks in general is \"alak\", derived from the Arabic word \"arrak\". The term \"arak,\" though, is specifically used in Ilocano. Arracks in the Philippines are predominantly not distilled. They can be derived from palm sap (notably coconut, nipa palm, or kaong palm), sugarcane, or rice. The only native alcohol that is traditionally distilled is lambanóg, which is made from the sap of palm flowers. The process begins with the sap from palm flowers. The sap is harvested into bamboo receptacles similar to rubber tapping, then cooked or fermented to produce a mildly-alcoholic coconut toddy called \"tubâ\". The \"tubà\", which by itself is also a popular beverage, is further distilled to produce lambanóg.\n\nThe Italian explorer, Antonio Pigafetta, stated that the arrack that he drank in Palawan and nearby islands in 1521 was made from distilled rice wine. However, he was likely referring to \"pangasi\", a rice wine which is not distilled.\n\nSri Lanka is the largest producer of coconut arrack and up until 1992 the government played a significant role in its production.\n\nOther than water, the entire manufacturing process revolves around the fermentation and distillation of a single ingredient, the sap of unopened flowers from a coconut palm (\"Cocos nucifera\"). Each morning at dawn, men known as toddy tappers move among the tops of coconut trees using connecting ropes not unlike tightropes. A single tree may contribute up to two litres per day.\n\nDue to its concentrated sugar and yeast content, the captured liquid naturally and immediately ferments into a mildly alcoholic drink called \"toddy\", \"tuak\", or occasionally \"palm wine\". Within a few hours after collection, the toddy is poured into large wooden vats, called \"wash backs\", made from the wood of teak or Berrya cordifolia. The natural fermentation process is allowed to continue in the washbacks until the alcohol content reaches 5-7% and deemed ready for distillation.\n\nDistillation is generally a two-step process involving either pot stills, continuous stills, or a combination of both. The first step results in \"low wine\", a liquid with an alcohol content between 20 and 40%. The second step results in the final distillate with an alcohol content of 60 to 90%. It is generally distilled to between 33% and 50% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 66 to 100 proof. The entire distillation process is completed within 24 hours. Various blends of coconut arrack diverge in processing, yet the extracted spirit may also be sold raw, repeatedly distilled or filtered, or transferred back into halmilla vats for maturing up to 15 years, depending on flavor, color and fragrance requirements.\n\nPremium blends of arrack add no other ingredients, while the inexpensive and common blends are mixed with neutral spirits before bottling. Most people describe the taste as resembling \"…a blend between whiskey and rum\", similar, but distinctively different at the same time.\n\nCoconut arrack is traditionally consumed by itself or with ginger beer, a popular soda in Sri Lanka. It also may be mixed in cocktails as a substitute for the required portions of either rum or whiskey. Arrack is often combined with popular mixers such as cola, soda water, and lime juice.\n\nAccording to the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre's 2008 report on alcohol in Sri Lanka, the types of arrack are:\n\n\nSri Lanka's largest manufacturers, listed in order based on their 2007 annual production of arrack, are:\n\n\nCeylon Arrack, a brand of Sri Lankan coconut arrack, was recently launched in the UK in 2010. It is also available in France and Germany. White Lion VSOA entered the American market soon after.\nHistorically Arrack has been a common beverage on the island of St Helena, distilled from potatoes. This is likely due to influences of the East India Company, which controlled St Helena and used it as a halfway point between India and England.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland, batavia-arrack has historically been mixed with other ingredients in order to make Swedish punsch (now available in prepackaged bottles). The alcohol content is normally not over 25%, although it has a high sugar content of nearly 30%. The original recipe was a mixture of arrack with water, sugar, lemon, and tea and/or spices (chiefly nutmeg). Today punsch is mostly drunk warm as an accompaniment to yellow split pea soup, although it is also used as a flavouring in several types pastries and sweets as well. The name arrak is still retained for some pastries, for example \"arraksboll\", whereas punsch is used for things like \"punschrulle\".\n\nThe word derived from the Arabic word \"arak\" (عرق, \"arq\"), meaning 'distillate'. In the Middle East and Near East, the term \"arak\" is usually used for liquor distilled from grapes and flavored with anise.\n\nUnlike arak, the word arrack has been considered by some experts to be derived from \"areca nut\", a palm seed originating in India from the areca tree and used as the basis for many varieties of arrack. In 1838, Samuel Morewood's work on the histories of liquors was published. On the topic of arrack, he said:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1848141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848141", "title": "Henry Weston Smith", "text": "Henry Weston Smith\n\nThe Reverend Henry Weston Smith (January 10, 1827 – August 20, 1876) was an American preacher and early resident of Deadwood, South Dakota.\n\nUnlike most of the residents of the time, he was not interested in material riches; instead, he was the first preacher, of any denomination, in the Black Hills Gold Rush camps.\n\nSmith was born in Ellington, Connecticut to Joshua Weston and Percey or Persey (Galpin) Smith of Berlin, Connecticut. In 1847, he married Ruth Yeomans, but both his wife and infant son died one year later. At the age of 23, Smith became a licensed \"exhorter\" and later a Methodist preacher. On February 23, 1858, while still in Connecticut, he married Lydia Ann Joselyn or Joslin, with whom he had four children. He subsequently moved to Massachusetts and, during the American Civil War, served with the Massachusetts 52nd Infantry, after which he became a doctor in 1867. The family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1876.\n\nIn 1876, although not being appointed to do so by the church, Smith felt a calling to minister to the Black Hills Gold Rush, and that spring he accompanied a wagon train from Cheyenne, Wyoming to the Black Hills, traveling on foot. He found work as a prospector and boarded a freight train in Custer, arriving in Deadwood in May 1876.\n\nAccording to George V. Ayres, later a prominent merchant in the area, \"Reverend Smith held the first church service in the Hills\" at Custer City, on May 7, 1876, with 30 men and five women in attendance. Smith preached in Custer again the next Sunday, then offered $5 to Captain C.V. Gardner to accompany his wagon train to Deadwood, a three-day walk; as a Methodist himself, Gardner allowed Smith to come along without charge. In Deadwood, Smith became a street preacher, working at odd jobs during the week in addition to prospecting and mining, and also worked on the Boulder Ditch, a large project that did not pay many of those worked on it.\n\nAfter working during the week, Smith would be found preaching on Main Street on Sundays and would travel miles on foot to preach at other settlements. \n\nJohn S. McClintock's memoirs describe Smith preaching near the corner of Main and Gold Streets, to a mixture of curiosity and respect, with some removing their hats to listen. \n\nAs described by Gardner:\n\n\"In the years past I have noted in the press many statements regarding incidents connected with the man known as Preacher Smith. Most of them are pure romance. ... how he used to go into the saloons and pray are pure fiction. I never saw him in a saloon, and I am sure he never was. He preached frequently in Deadwood, generally in front of Bent and Deetken's drug store or in front of my store. ... in those days the town had 3,000 to 4,000 people, located mostly on one street, and he had no trouble in securing an audience. He was a man about 6 feet tall, with a fine physique and I should say 40 years old. He was very quiet and unassuming in manner. I know nothing of his past life, as he never volunteered to tell me and it was not wise in those days to inquire too closely into a man's antecedents.\"\nOn Sunday, August 20, 1876, Smith left a note on his cabin door after his Deadwood service, saying \"Gone to Crook City to preach, and if God is willing, will be back at three o’clock.\" Friends concerned about the danger of Indians or thieves had warned Smith against walking alone and unarmed, but he is remembered as replying, \"The Bible is my protection. It has never failed me yet.\" Unfortunately, Smith was murdered as he walked to Crook City, his body found alongside the road by a local resident, the exact location no longer remembered. He had not been robbed, causing his death to be generally attributed to Indians, although some still believed he was killed by thieves. Another theory, however, held that he was murdered by a person or persons representing the saloons, brothels, casinos, and other 'vice dens' of Deadwood, who feared that his preaching would cut into their income. Similar rumors had circulated after the recent murder of Wild Bill Hickok.\n\nSeth Bullock, Deadwood's sheriff, described Smith's death in an August 21, 1876 letter to Reverend J. S. Chadwick:\n\n\"It becomes my painful duty to inform you that Rev. H. Weston Smith was killed by the Indians yesterday (Sunday) a short distance from this place. He had an appointment to preach here in the afternoon, and was on his way from Crook City when a band of Indians overtook him and shot him. His body was not mutilated in any way, and was found in the road a short time after the hellish deed had been done. His death was instantaneous as he was shot through the heart. His funeral occurred today from his home in this town. Everything was done by kind hands, that was possible under the circumstances, and a Christian burial given him. I was not personally acquainted with Mr. Smith, but knew him by reputation, as an earnest worker in his Master's Vineyard. He has preached here on several occasions, and was the only minister in the Hills. He died in the harness and his memory will be always with those who knew him. A letter from you which I found in his home causes me to convey this sad intelligence to you.\"\n\nSmith's body was buried in a hillside cemetery in Deadwood, the service conducted by C. E. Hawley, a member of Smith's flock, in the absence of other clergy. The casket was later moved to Mount Moriah Cemetery, with a life-sized statue marking his grave.\n\nIn 1914, the Society of Black Hills Pioneers erected a monument on the road between Deadwood and Spearfish, South Dakota, in the approximate area where Smith's body had been found. In 1994, Highway 85 north of Deadwood, along with the Preacher Smith Monument, was relocated by construction of a four-lane road. A copper time capsule that had been buried in 1914 was opened, providing some period artifacts, such as newspapers; after examination, they, along with additional contemporary items, were returned to the capsule and reburied under the new monument, three miles south of Deadwood on the rebuilt Highway 85. The new monument was rededicated on August 20, 1995, on the 119th anniversary of Smith's murder. The highlight of the ceremony was a reading by local resident, historian, and lawyer Reed Richards of the sermon Preacher Smith had planned to deliver at Crook City that fateful day, 119 years delayed.\n\nSmith was portrayed in the HBO television series \"Deadwood\" (2004–2006) by actor Ray McKinnon. The letter written by the character of Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) in the third season episode \"Unauthorized Cinnamon\" is similar to the August 21, 1876, letter to Reverend J. S. Chadwick written by the real Seth Bullock. In the show, the circumstances of Smith's demise were changed to a gradual decay due to a brain tumor, though he was killed by Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) before dying from the cancer.\n\nHe was also depicted conducting the funeral of Wild Bill Hickok when in reality there was no preacher involved in his burial.\n\n"}

The eight-line poem is presented as a single, rueful stanza from the point of view of a New York Giants fan watching the Chicago Cubs infield of shortstop Joe Tinker, second baseman Johnny Evers, and first baseman Frank Chance complete a double play. These three players helped the Cubs win four National League championships and two World Series from 1906 to 1910.\n\n\"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\" became popular across the United States among sportswriters, who wrote their own verses along the same vein. The poem only enhanced the reputations of Tinker, Evers, and Chance over the succeeding decades as the phrase became a synonymous with a feat of smooth and ruthless efficiency. It has been credited with their elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.\n\nThe poem was first published in the \"New York Evening Mail\" on July 12, 1910, under the title \"That Double Play Again.\" The day before, the Cubs had defeated the Giants, 4–2, in Chicago, having squelched a late-inning Giants rally with a double play from Tinker to Evers to Chance. \n\nTinker, Evers, and Chance began playing together with the Cubs in September 1902, forming a double play combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the National League pennant four times from 1906 and 1910 and won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, a five-year span that saw them regularly defeat the arch-rival Giants en route to the pennants and World Series.\n\nFrank Chance joined the Chicago Cubs in 1898 as a reserve catcher, backing up Tim Donahue and Johnny Kling. Frank Selee, the Cubs' manager, decided that Chance would be better suited as a first baseman. Chance at first opposed the move and even threatened to quit, but ultimately obliged. Joe Tinker was a third baseman in minor league baseball, but in 1902 made the Cubs as a shortstop, replacing Barry McCormick. Johnny Evers made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop, with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base. Three days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base to back up Bobby Lowe.\nLowe suffered a knee injury late in the 1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time. Tinker, Evers, and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902. They turned their first double play on September 15, 1902. Lowe's injury did not properly heal during the offseason, making Evers the new permanent second baseman for the Cubs in 1903. Chance succeeded Selee as manager during the 1905 season when Selee became ill.\n\nThe Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs clinched the pennant after defeating the Giants in part due to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1910, the Cubs turned 491 double plays, the third-most in the NL during that time. According to Bill James' formula, \"expected double plays\", the Cubs led the NL with 50 more double plays than expected during those five seasons. From 1906 through 1910, the \"Tinker, to Evers, to Chance\" double play happened 54 times in 770 games played, and the trio did not collaborate on a double play during any of their 21 World Series games. In 1906, the trio committed 194 errors, though this was in part due to poor field conditions and scorers.\n\nFranklin Pierce Adams wrote a weekly column for the \"New York Evening Mail\", called \"Always in Good Humor\". Adams hoped to leave work to attend a Giants game, but his editor found that Adams had not produced enough content for his column. While traveling to the Polo Grounds to see the Giants play the Cubs, Adams wrote the poem that would become \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\", while reflecting on Tinker, Evers, and Chance. He considered the lines to be forgettable as he wrote them, and an editor at the paper told him that he did not consider the work to be \"much good\".\n\nThis work was first published as \"That Double Play Again\" in the \"New York Evening Mail\" on July 12, 1910 (not on July 10 as numerous sources state). The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" reprinted it as \"Gotham's Woe\" on July 15, 1910. Three days later, on July 18, the \"New York Evening Mail\" republished it under the title by which it is best known today, \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon.\" The poem was such a hit that other sportswriters submitted additional verses.\n\nFor the poem's 100th anniversary, Tim Wiles, director of research at the Baseball Hall of Fame, conducted research on the poem. He revealed that the poem was part of series of poems published in the \"New York Evening Mail\" and the \"Chicago Tribune\". During the research process, combing the archives in the New York Public Library and the Center for Research Libraries, they uncovered 29 poems, 15 of which detail a specific play or game that had occurred during the 1910 season, with \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\" the first poem published.\n\nIn 1911, the Giants overcame the Cubs, capturing the first of three consecutive National League pennants. The trio played their final game together on April 12, 1912. While Chance was hospitalized for a brain injury suffered while playing, club owner Charles Webb Murphy released him after an argument about Murphy's releasing other players with high salaries. Murphy named Evers manager for the 1913 season, which displeased Tinker, who was traded to the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nMurphy fired Evers as manager after one season, trading him against his will to the Boston Braves in February 1914. As a consequence, National League president John K. Tener and newspaper owner Charles P. Taft (who also owned the Philadelphia Phillies) made a successful effort to drive Murphy out of baseball. Taft purchased the Cubs from Murphy in 1914. \"Sporting Life\" commemorated the affair with this variation on the poem:\n\nChance died in 1924, Evers in 1947, and Tinker in 1948. The poem was regularly used to memorialize each of the players after his death.\n\nAll three players were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited in part to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs as well as a coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, \"Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?\", argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was not a member of the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe poem gave the trio \"everlasting fame\". Evers made an appearance on \"Information Please\", a radio show on which Adams was a panelist in 1938. Evers thanked Adams for writing the poem, which he credited for his being remembered. However, many forgot Harry Steinfeldt, the third baseman who started alongside Tinker, Evers, and Chance from 1906 through 1910. Including Steinfeldt, the Cubs infield set a record for longevity surpassed by the Los Angeles Dodgers infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell, and third baseman Ron Cey, who played together for eight years, from 1973 through 1981.\n\nDespite their celebrated success at turning spectacular plays in collaboration, relations between the teammates were said to have been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.\n\nThe phrase \"Tinker to Evers to Chance,\" and variations using other names, have been colloquially used to characterize high-caliber teamwork. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poem's title has also been used to characterize any process that happens with smoothness and precision, as a near-synonym to expressions such as \"like clockwork\" or \"a well-oiled machine.\" For example:\n\n\n\nOgden Nash, in his 1949 poem \"Line-Up For Yesterday: An ABC of Baseball Immortals,\" referred to the trio of players in a stanza for the letter \"E\":\nWalt Kelly, in the May 7, 1953 installment of the \"Pogo\" comic strip, depicted the character Simple J. Malarkey (a caricature of Senator Joseph McCarthy) advising a preacher that the Constitution \"can't guarantee what happens after you speak up... it don't pay to tinker forever with chance, ha ha like the fella says.\"\n\nMusician Scott Miller, leader of the 1980s band Game Theory, chose \"Tinker to Evers to Chance\" as the ironic title of a 1990 compilation album of the band's greatest would-be hits which, despite significant critical acclaim, had struck out commercially. Like Nash, Miller emphasized the double meaning of the names, creating a visual pun by featuring a piece from a Tinkertoy set (\"tinker\"), a pocket watch (\"evers\"), and a die (\"chance\") on the album cover.\n\nThe poem was set to music and recorded in 2010 by Chicago singer/songwriter guitarist Chris McCaughan. The song, also titled \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon,\" appears on the album \"We Chase the Waves\" by McCaughan's solo project, Sundowner.\n\n\n"}

As such it was a minority government and relied on the support of four independents.\n\nThe resulting Ministry was interesting for various reasons. It was the first Labor Ministry in Western Australia and one of the first in Australia. Unlike all previous Ministries, it consisted almost entirely of men who had immigrated to Western Australia in the previous two decades. Some hurdles needed to be overcome. A constitutional requirement that the Ministry include at least one member of the Legislative Council was met when John Drew, an Independent member of that chamber, agreed to serve. Additionally, as Labor contained no lawyers within its ranks, the role of Attorney-General as chief law officer of the State lapsed, and Robert Hastie was named Minister for Justice instead.\n\nJust over a year later, the Government lost support on the floor of the house and fell on a vote of no confidence. On 25 August 1905, it was followed by the Rason Ministry led by Hector Rason, a former Minister in the James Ministry.\n\nOn 10 August 1904, the Governor, Admiral Sir Frederick Bedford, designated 6 principal executive offices of the Government under section 43(2) of the Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899.

Galarpe (US-Veteran, Ret) is considered to be the father of Aikido in the Philippines. He began training in 1957 in Guam under Harry S. Ito. Four years later he earned his Shodan (rank) degree from the Japan Aikido Hombu Dojo. He was the first Aikido representative of the Japan Aikikai Hombu Dojo to spread and propagate Aikido in the Philippines. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, promoted him to the degree of Nidan after advanced training in the World Aikido Hombu in Sanjukuku, Tokyo, Japan. While teaching in the Philippines, he held exhibitions in Bicol, Pampanga, Baguio, Olongapo City, Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Cebu City, Batangas City, and other places within the Philippines. Benjamin Galarpe's students, namely Chan Hok-seng, Ernesto Talag, Max Tian and Manuel \"Omar\" Camar, became the prime movers of the Aikido Movement in the Philippines.\n\nIn 1963, Benjamin began teaching Aikido in San Andres, Bukid, Malate, Philippines. Monching J. Gavileño, later to found the \"Aikido Association of the Philippines\" (AAP), became his first student. The school later moved to Avenida Rizal, Philippines and finally settled in Quiapo located within Metro Manila, Philippines. the school was known as the \"Manila Aikikai\" and was under the supervision of Manuel \"Omar\" Camar.\n\nIn 1965 Koichi Tohei, the chief instructor of Aikido Hombu in the World Aikido Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan visited the Aikido schools in Manila, Philippines and held Aikido exhibitions along with Benjamin Galarpe throughout the Philippines.

The now orphaned Manila Aikido Club, which Galarpe founded for the Aikikai, was left in the hands of his student Manuel \"Omar\" Camar.\n\nAs far as he was concerned, Galarpe's decision to ally himself with Tohei was his personal choice and was not supposed to involve any of his students nor the Manila Aikido Club. However, three of his students, Ernesto Talag of Quezon City, Chan Hok-seng of Pampanga and Max Tian of Cebu, did decide to follow Galarpe's example and remain loyal to Koichi Tohei. Ernesto Talag joined Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido and founded the Ki Society of the Philippines. Max Tian did the same thing and established the Cebu Ki Society. Chan Hok-seng, founder of the Angeles Aikido Club and long-time friend of Galarpe, decided to follow his teacher's example to the letter. But unlike Galarpe, Chan Hok-seng decided to close down his school rather than pass it on to someone else.\n\nGalarpe returned to Guam in 1968. Once established in Guam he began teaching Aikido at the University of Guam Guam Police Science Academy for the next four years. While there, he taught college students and police recruits physical education and the arts of Aikido.\n\nIn 1972, Galarpe founded the School of Self-Defense in Guam.

{"id": "1848214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848214", "title": "Abermule train collision", "text": "Abermule train collision\n\nThe Abermule train collision was a head-on collision which occurred at Abermule, Montgomeryshire, Wales on 26 January 1921, killing 17 people. The crash arose from misunderstandings between staff which effectively over-rode the safe operation of the Electric Train Tablet system protecting the single line. A train departed carrying the wrong tablet for the section it was entering and collided with a train coming the other way.\n\nThe Cambrian Railways, which traversed Wales from Whitchurch in Shropshire to and , via , contained a number of single line sections. The small station of Abermule was a crossing station between two such sections. To the east was , to the west was Newtown.\n\nTo protect the single line sections, Tyer's Electric Train Tablet apparatus was used. Two linked tablet instruments were used on each section, one at each end. To allow a train to proceed into the section, a call button would be pressed on one instrument, alerting the operator at the other end of the section. If the other operator was in a position to accept the train, he would then press a release button on his instrument, which allowed a tablet (a metal plate inscribed with the name of the section) to be withdrawn from the caller's instrument. The tablet would then be placed inside a pouch fitted with a metal loop (which allowed it to be easily picked up or handed over by a train crew while in motion) and given to the driver of the train as proof of his authority to occupy the section. Until the tablet was replaced in one of the instruments, another tablet could not be withdrawn from either of them. Tablets of adjacent sections had differently-shaped and -positioned holes and notches in them to prevent a tablet being inserted into wrong instrument.\n\nThis system had protected the Cambrian Railways for many years. There was a weakness at Abermule, in that the electric tablet machines and the other block telegraph instruments were kept in the main station buildings, while the signals were worked from a separate signal box at the east end of the station, and some of the points from a ground frame at the other end of the station. Regulations specified that only the stationmaster or signalman were to work the tablet machines, but it was common for both to be occupied with duties away from the station buildings, and it became accepted practice for any member of the station staff to work them.\n\nShortly before midday on 26 January 1921, a west-bound stopping train from Whitchurch and an east-bound express from Aberystwyth were approaching Abermule from opposite directions, and were due to cross there. The regular Abermule Stationmaster, Parry, was on leave, and Relief Stationmaster Lewis, who was deputising for him, had gone for his lunch. The other three station staff at Abermule were Signalman Jones, Porter Rogers, who was seventeen, and a trainee booking clerk named Thompson, who was only fifteen years old.\n\nThe staff at Montgomery station requested clearance for the stopping train to run to Abermule, and Signalman Jones pressed the release on the tablet instrument for the Montgomery-Abermule section, allowing the train to proceed. He then checked that the express was running to time, and was informed that it had just passed Moat Lane Junction on the far side of Newtown, as scheduled. Jones went to the signal box to open the level crossing gates and clear the signals for the stopping train. Meanwhile, Relief Stationmaster Lewis returned from his lunch. A permanent way sub-inspector attracted his attention with an urgent enquiry, and the stationmaster immediately went with the sub-inspector to the goods yard, without entering the instrument room or inquiring as to the position of any trains approaching Abermule.\n\nNewtown station then requested permission for the express to proceed to Abermule. Porter Rogers pressed the release on the tablet machine for the Newtown-Abermule section which allowed it to do so. He then went to the ground frame at the west end of the station to set the points for the express, but found the frame locked against him because Jones had already \"set the road\" for the stopping train to arrive on the down road. While Rogers was occupied at the ground frame, Newtown signalled that the express was entering the Newtown-Abermule section. However, there was no-one in the Abermule station buildings to note the signal.\n\nBefore Porter Rogers could call to Signalman Jones to release the ground frame lock, the stopping train arrived. The youth, Thompson, collected the tablet for the Montgomery-Abermule section from the driver of the stopping train, and was heading back to the station buildings to put it in the tablet instrument when he met Lewis returning from the goods yard. He gave the tablet to Lewis, saying that he had to go and collect the tickets (although only one passenger had alighted from the train). He did not mention that he had yet to exchange the tablet for one for the Abermule-Newtown section (which he could not have done, because the Abermule-Newtown tablet machine was still locked). Thompson also mistakenly told Lewis that the express was still \"about Moat Lane\", presumably from having overheard some of Jones's earlier telephone conversation.\n\nLewis assumed that because the express had apparently not reached Newtown, the two trains would cross at Newtown rather than Abermule, and he did not look at the tablet closely enough to see that it was the one for the Montgomery-Abermule section that had just been handed over by the driver of the stopping train. He crossed back to the down platform and, because the driver was oiling around the engine, handed the tablet back to the stopping train's fireman, who did not notice the error either. Lewis gave the \"Right away\" signal by hand. Jones, who was also on the down platform, assumed that the express had been delayed or held at Newtown for some reason. Rogers, who was still at the ground frame, assumed the same, because of Lewis's actions and because the frame was locked, and so he lowered the down advance starting signal. Lewis, Jones and Rogers did not realise the truth until the stopping train had already departed.\nThe crew of the express were travelling at about , and about to begin slowing for the arrival at Abermule, when they saw the stopping train heading for them on the same track. Although they immediately braked, they could not stop in time. The crew of the stopping train did not appear to have seen them, because they continued to put on steam. The crew of the express were just able to jump clear in time, although they were both severely injured. Fifteen passengers, including a director of the railway, Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest, and the driver and fireman of the stopping train, were killed in the collision.\n\nAfter the crash, Driver Pritchard Jones of the express train was desperately concerned that he had made an error, until his fireman, Owen, retrieved both their own correct tablet for the section, and the tablet for the Montgomery-Abermule section, from the wreckage. The tablets were handed to the Traffic Controller for the Cambrian Railways, who had been travelling on the stopping train, and the Chief Traffic Inspector, who had been a passenger on the express. The Inspector (George) took the Montgomery-Abermule tablet on foot to Abermule station and replaced it in the correct machine in the presence of witnesses, to allow a breakdown train from Oswestry to reach the scene of the crash and assist with freeing the injured.\n\nThe engines involved were 4-4-0 passenger locomotives. Both were reduced to wreckage and written off. There was severe telescoping of the passenger carriages, especially in the express train, which caused most of the casualties. This was apparently the result of the collision occurring on a slight curve, causing the buffers to be slightly misaligned, and allowing the fourth carriage of the express to override the buffers of the third.\n\nThe obvious cause of the Abermule collision was the unauthorised working of the tablet machines by anyone who happened to be around, and the failure of the staff at Abermule to notify each other of their actions. The slack working practices had been allowed to develop over several years by Stationmaster Parry and Signalman Jones.\n\nA contributory cause was the failure of anyone to examine the tablet they received by removing it from its pouch and checking that it was the correct one. Although inspection of the tablet was required in the working rules, it was clearly taken for granted that the tablet was correct, since the system had worked faultlessly for years. Indeed, for anyone to ostentatiously examine a tablet may have been a breach of etiquette, as it would imply that the person handing it over might not be competent or trustworthy. Driver Pritchard Jones and Fireman Owen of the express train were conscientious in inspecting every tablet they received; the crew of the stopping train were not.\n\nFinally, the awkward layout of tablet instruments, signals and points levers at Abermule meant that it was possible for conflicting movements to be made. The inquiry recommended that tablet machines be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) be interlocked with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet. The signalling method continued in use on the line until 1988, when it was replaced by the radio-controlled electronic token block system.\n\nThe obvious, though costly, solution to the problems of working single lines would be to double the tracks. As finances allowed, the Cambrian Railways (and the Great Western Railway, which took over the Cambrian after the grouping of 1923) had been slowly carrying out the necessary work. Ironically, British Rail actually removed much of the doubled track and some of the crossing stations as part of the Beeching Axe.\n\nIn August 2019, an operating irregularity on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent resulted in two passenger trains being on a single track section of line heading in opposite directions.

It is a member of NASCO. The first coop was established in 1976, and currently there are six houses; Newman, Manley, Dolores, Biko, Merton, and Persimmon. In all, 118 students live in these houses.\n\nThe purpose of the Santa Barbara Student Housing Co-op (SBSHC) is to provide low rent co-op housing regardless of gender, race, social, political, or religious affiliation. SBSHC engages in continuous educational programs that further the principles of cooperation through mutual, self-help living at a minimal cost.\n\nThe co-ops are located in Isla Vista and are centers of artistic expression, alternative thought, social activism and creativity in the frantic party boom and bust community that is Isla Vista. The co-op system organizes the annual \"Co-opula\" festival featuring local musical talent, spoken word, local organic food and outdoor entertainment in Anisq'Oyo' Park in Isla Vista. In 2006, the massively successful and now institutionalized \"Chillavista\" festival was organized out of the Biko co-op, and featured musical talent from the Isla Vista community including many bands spawned from and frequently performing at Isla Vista Co-ops. Chillavista was powered through renewable energy, featured local organic produce, screened several films on progressivism and sustainability and proved to be a highly successful zero waste event featuring national touring acts such as Delta Nove, Blue Turtle Seduction, Elijah Manuel & The Revelations and local psychedelic jam masters Silent Wei.\n\nIn 2006, the Isla Vista co-ops provided pivotal support to the over 200 residents evicted from their homes in Isla Vista by Conquest Housing. Many in the Isla Vista community regarded these evictions as racially motivated, since nearly all of the 200 men, women, and children who were evicted were Hispanic and had little access to legal representation on their behalf. In response, some residents of the co-ops rallied support for the families by throwing benefit concerts, establishing a protest \"tent city\" in the center of the UCSB campus and staging marches throughout Santa Barbara to raise awareness of these families' concerns. The efforts have contributed to the larger emerging front in Isla Vista united against the ongoing pattern of discriminatory eviction followed by student rent gouging.\n\nSBSHC also has a long-standing partnership with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative through purchasing most of its common houses' food through the food co-op, being the food co-op's biggest customer, making food co-op staff eligible to live in SBSHC houses, and shared leadership.\n\nDuring the summer of 2005, Manley received a remodeled kitchen, new roof, new windows, a converted storage to study room, a complete solar panel system, landscaped garden area and refinished upstairs deck. Residents now participate in a full meal plan with both meat and vegetarian/vegan options. The house charge covers electricity, gas, water, trash, laundry, and cable internet.\n\nThe Manley house has eleven bedrooms in two separate units. Three bedrooms are located upstairs, where there is a large deck and living room. Downstairs are eight bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, dining room, and study space.\n\nThe house is named after Steven Manley, who died August 15, 1979, battling a brush wildfire near Santa Maria. He was 21 years old and a Junior Environmental Studies Major at UCSB, working the summer as a firefighter with the California Division of Forestry.\n\nAlthough Newman has nine separate apartments (six two-bedroom/one-bath units and three studios), Newman is a housing community. There is no meal plan for the Newman building but some members participate in optional potlucks. The homemade fire pit in front, worm bin composting system, gardens, and mural painting projects on the Newman's doors and walls, allows members to be creative and communal. The House charge for Newman's residents covers laundry, parking, water, trash and cable internet.\n\nNewman House is named after Patti Newman, the first Executive Director and staff member of SBSHC.\n\nDolores, formerly called Dashain, is a vegetarian/vegan house. Dolores strives to buy local food and cultivate a partnership with their neighboring organic and whole foods cooperative, the Isla Vista Food Co-op. Of the co-ops, Dolores is the closest to the beach situated on the 67 block of Sabado Tarde Road. Sunsets can be viewed from the window of the top three rooms, and fire loving occurs in the backyard. Dolores maintains its own garden space out back which once hosted a family of chickens.\n\nThe house has nine bedrooms and three bathrooms. Dolores has traditionally never had television in common space but have hosted community screenings in the living room or front and backyard. The house charge covers water, trash, electricity, gas, cable internet, parking and laundry.\n\nDolores is named after Dolores Huerta, a civil rights activist and co-founder of the National Farmworkers Association (now the United Farm Workers (UFW)) .\n\nNamed after Stephen Bantu Biko, founder and martyr of the Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa, Biko has been SBSHC's \"People of Color\" Co-op. Biko's theme provides a safe, respectful space for people of color in a predominantly white college campus community. A social justice house, Biko has been known to host ethnic studies events and socials for the Queer Student Union (QSU). Biko has twelve bedrooms and six bathrooms. Its kitchen is large and spacious, with industrial-strength cooking facilities and a stocked pantry. Biko has a mandatory meal plan that always offers both meat and vegetarian/vegan options. The House charge includes gas, electricity, water, trash, and laundry, and cable internet.\n\nThe garage space out front functions as central storage as well as an all-purpose community space for radical meetings, music, art exhibitions and dance. Biko Garage is funded by donation only, and is run and operated by house members. The basketball court and front garden and porch space, as well as ample parking, are some of the other benefits of living at the Biko.\n\nThe Thomas Merton Interfaith House was completed in April 2013, with the first residents moving in June 2013. The co-op house, located on the second floor of the building, has a large kitchen and living room, with semi dorm-style bathrooms. There is a sizable garden on the north side of the building, as well as bike storage lockers, SBSHC's office, and an auditorium and kitchen used for five SBSHC events per year.\n\nThe theme of the house is Interfaith, continuing the legacy of the University Religious Center who previously owned the building. Through continuing funds, co-op members are enabled to attend interfaith conferences, host interfaith-themed events, and make connections with faith groups around the community and the world.\n\nSBSHC members who live at Merton House, are students at University of California, Santa Barbara, and who qualify as low income by the standards set by the County of Santa Barbara receive a scholarship that is a significant reduction in their rent, making Merton House the most affordable UCSB student housing in Isla Vista.\n\nMerton House is named after Thomas Merton, an Anglo-American Catholic writer and Mystic who was an advocate of spirituality, social justice, pacifism, and interfaith understanding post-World War II.\n\n"}

A general store, tavern, and a few other buildings would be erected. Near these villages, the social, commercial, educational, and religious aspects of the emerging society originated and were supported.\n\nTo a large extent, crossroads villages provided identity and vitality to the surrounding countryside and a sense of community in the early years of settlement.

As a player, Williams represented in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) as well as Collingwood and Brisbane Bears in the Australian Football League (AFL) from the 1980s to the 1990s.\n\nOne of several successful father-son combinations in Australian rules football, Williams became a successful coach after finishing his playing career, leading to their first AFL premiership in 2004.\n\nThe son of South Australian football legend Fos Williams, Williams playing career began with , where his father was serving as coach. He represented West Adelaide on 64 occasions for 37 goals. Williams then moved to the Port Adelaide Football Club, becoming one of the stars of the SANFL.\n\nAfter the 1980 season, Williams was recruited by , making his Victorian Football League (VFL) debut in the 1981 season. Williams justified the hype over his recruitment by winning state selection for Victoria as well as the Copeland Trophy. He was named at centre for Collingwood in the Grand Final against Carlton. Collingwood lost, but Williams was recognised as being among the Magpies' better players on the day. When John Cahill took over as coach after a tumultuous season in 1982, he appointed Williams captain, having previously worked with him at . Williams remained captain of Collingwood until he left at the end of 1986.\n\nIn 1984 Williams led Collingwood's goalkicking, kicking 53 goals for the season. However, he was unavailable for the Preliminary Final due to injury, and Collingwood went down to eventual premiers by 133 points.\n\nA contract dispute at the end of the 1986 season saw Williams reluctantly make the move north to join the fledgling Brisbane Bears. He was appointed vice-captain to Mark Mickan at the new club. Williams played three and a half seasons before retiring from the Bears midway through the 1990 AFL season.\n\nWilliams returned to Port Adelaide, and finished the 1990 season there, before playing a further two seasons. In his two stints at Port Adelaide, Williams played 115 games, kicking 104 goals, and won four premierships. He retired from playing at the end of 1992, with a total of 380 league games to his name.\n\nWilliams coached SANFL club Glenelg in 1993 and 1994 before joining AFL club Essendon as an assistant coach.\n\nIn 1997, Williams joined Port Adelaide as an assistant coach in its inaugural season in the AFL, and in 1999, won the head coaching role at Port Adelaide, replacing John Cahill. Port Adelaide won the minor premiership three seasons in a row under Williams' reign (2002, 2003 and 2004); after failing to reach the Grand Final in either 2002 or 2003, the club went on to win its first AFL premiership in 2004. In 2007, Williams once again coached Port Adelaide to the Grand Final, but his side suffered the worst ever grand final defeat, losing to Geelong by 119 points. Throughout 2009, Port Adelaide's inconsistent on-field performances continued to focus on Williams' future at the club. Late in the season, following the appointment of Mark Haysman as CEO, and after much conjecture in the media, Williams was offered a new 2-year contract. On 9 July 2010, Williams resigned as coach of Port Adelaide and coached his final game for Port Adelaide against Collingwood at AAMI Stadium.\n\nIn 2010, Williams signed with the Greater Western Sydney Giants as the senior assistant coach to Kevin Sheedy.\nIn September 2012, Williams informed the club after the last home and away game of the season that he would not be honouring the final season of his contract in 2013.\n\nAfter the completion of the 2012 home and away season, Williams signed with the Richmond Football Club as a development coach working with senior coach Damien Hardwick. In November 2014, Williams was diagnosed with lymphoma.\n\nWilliams comes from a large and intensely proud footballing dynasty, closely aligned with Port Adelaide. His father, the late Fos Williams, is often referred to as the father of the Port Adelaide Football Club. His twin brother Anthony played at SANFL level, while younger brother Stephen played at both SANFL and AFL level and coached Port Adelaide to three SANFL premierships. His sister, Jenny, briefly served as a psychologist with the club. Mark is married to Pauline and they have three sons and two daughters.\n\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1981\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1982\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1983\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1984\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1985\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1986\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1987\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1988\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1989\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1990\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 201\n! 236\n! 179\n! 2874\n! 1206\n! 4080\n! 738\n! 158\n! 1.2\n! 0.9\n! 14.3\n! 6.0\n! 20.3\n! 3.7\n! 2.4\n\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 1999\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2000\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2001\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2002\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2003\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2004\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2005\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2006\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2007\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2008\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2009\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\" | 2010\n! colspan=2| Career totals\n! 274\n! 151\n! 121\n! 2\n! 55.5%\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n\n1990 SANFL Grand Final\n\n"}

He was apprenticed as a coachbuilder and migrated to Victoria with his father in 1842. He worked for some years as a labourer before establishing himself as a wheelwright and coachbuilder in 1847. Thereafter he grew increasingly prosperous. He was a teetotaller and a leading temperance campaigner. The Temperance Hall in Russell Street was built largely due to his efforts.\n\nHeales was elected to the Melbourne City Council in 1850. He resigned in 1852 and returned to England, but was back in Melbourne in time for the first election held under the new Constitution of Victoria in September 1856. He stood for the seat of Melbourne in the Legislative Assembly, but was defeated. He was elected member for East Bourke at a by-election in March 1857. In October 1859, Heales won the seat of East Bourke Boroughs and held it for the rest of his life.\n\nIn October 1860, Heales was a leading critic of the land bill introduced by the government of William Nicholson. When the Nicholson government was defeated in November 1860, Heales became Premier and Chief Secretary. Heales set about advocating his own land policy, but in June 1861 he was defeated on a vote of confidence. He obtained a dissolution and with strong rural support was returned with an increased majority. In November 1861, however, some of his senior supporters defected, and he resigned as Premier.\n\nAlthough he was an active Congregationalist, Heales was an opponent of the clause in the Victorian Constitution which provided for state funding for religion, and he favoured a unified secular education system. Both Anglicans and Catholics, on the other hand, favoured state-funded religious schools. In 1862 Heales introduced a bill creating a single Education Board to rationalise the school system, which was passed with broad support.\n\nWhen John O'Shanassy was defeated as Premier for the third time in June 1863, Heales was appointed the President of the Board of Land and Works, and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Surveys in the ministry of James McCulloch. He brought in two further land bills during this time, but both were rejected by the Legislative Council.\n\nHeales fell ill in 1864, and died in June. He is buried in Melbourne General Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and eight children.\n\nThe town of Healesville, 52 km north-east of Melbourne, is named after him. In 1964, a Centenary of Healesville medal was commissioned and given to residents of the town. An image of Heales was on the front of the medal.\n\n"}
{"id": "1848250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848250", "title": "Esky", "text": "Esky\n\nEsky is an Australian brand of portable coolers. The term \"esky\" is also commonly used in Australia to generically refer to portable coolers or ice boxes and is part of the Australian vernacular, in place of words like \"cooler\" or \"cooler box\" and the New Zealand \"chilly bin\". The term derives from the word Eskimo.\n\nThe Esky was created by Malley's, a Sydney refrigeration business. Some historians have credited Malley's with the invention of the portable ice cooler. According to the company, the Esky was \"\"recognised as the first official portable cooler in the world.\"\" The company's own figures claim that by 1960, 500,000 Australian households owned one (in a country of approximately 10 million).\n\nOutdoor recreation company Coleman Australia bought the Esky brand from Nylex Ltd after the company went into administration in February 2009. Esky has been producing coolers since 1952. Coleman still produces most of the Esky line in Melbourne. The sale was seen as symptomatic of the decline of Australian made goods due to cheaper imports being available.\n\nThe current models are constructed with two layers: polypropylene on the outer shell, with a polyurethane inner layer. This makes it lightweight and portable with excellent insulation. The Esky originally had a steel outside shell, and used cork for insulation. In the 1960s, a single layer of thick polystyrene was often used, but they were easily damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe lightweight construction makes most eskies float in water, and they have been recommended by safety specialists to be used as an improvised lifebuoy, if more specialised equipment is not available. Numerous people have been saved after using either the whole esky or the esky lid as flotation devices after boating accidents.\n\nIn Australia, the 'esky' name has become, or as a legal matter nearly has become, genericised: the popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any cooler box, regardless of the brand. Many dictionaries, including the Australian National Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary, now include definitions in their publications defining it as such. However, the use of the Esky trademark must be approved by the brand owner to avoid any liability.\n\nGovernment agencies and media outlets in Australia have used the term in preference to generic alternatives.\n\nThe esky has played a unique role in Australian culture, especially with regard to outdoor activities, camping, and sporting events, and for reasons of novelty. In particular, the design and use of the esky has evolved through its relationship with Australia's drinking culture. A feature of the first Esky model was that it was designed to carry six \"standard\" 1-pint bottles as well as a triple level food section. Malley's Esky was created as a tool for camping and caravanning holidays and was called the Esky Auto Box, encouraged by the post-war popularity of the private motor vehicle. The esky became an essential part of the beach, outdoor dining and barbecue culture that developed in Australia during the 60s and 70s.\n\nThough not unique to Australia, Australian media have widely reported on a number of high-profile incidents involving motorised eskies fitted with small motors and wheels. Police have impounded offending vehicles and have issued fines to those operating them on public property.\n\nSpectators at the closing ceremony at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney each received a promotional pack of a small polystyrene Esky containing other items of memorabilia.\n\nIn another uniquely Australian piece of culture, poly-foam knee boards used in the surf, more especially by younger surfers learning the sport, are often referred to by the slang term, \"Esky-lid”, or “shark biscuit”.\n\n"}
{"id": "1848252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848252", "title": "Lenca", "text": "Lenca\n\nThe Lenca are a Mesoamerican indigenous people of southwestern Honduras and eastern El Salvador in Central America. They once spoke the Lenca language, which is now nearly extinct. In Honduras, the Lenca are the largest indigenous group, with an estimated population of 100,000. El Salvador's Lenca population is estimated at about 37,000.\n\nThe pre-Conquest Lenca had frequent contact with various Maya groups as well as other indigenous peoples of the territory of present-day Mexico and Central America. The origin of Lenca populations has been a source of ongoing debate among anthropologists and historians. Research has been directed to gaining archaeological evidence of the pre-colonial Lenca.\n\nLenca culture developed for centuries preceding the Spanish conquest. Like other indigenous groups of Central America, they gradually changed their cultural relationships to the land.\n\nWhile there are ongoing political problems in contemporary Central America over indigenous land rights and identity, the Lenca have retained many of their pre-Columbian traditions. Although their indigenous language is nearly extinct, and their culture has changed in other ways over the centuries by the Spanish influence, the Lenca continue to preserve some traditional ways and identify as indigenous peoples. There are programs and dictionaries to help revitilize the language and tradtion Lenca culture.\n\nModern Lenca communities are centered on the milpa crop-growing system. Lenca men engage in agriculture, including the cultivation of coffee, cacao, tobacco, varieties of plantains, and gourds. Other principal crops are maize, wheat, beans, squash, sugarcane, and chili peppers. In El Salvador peanuts are also cultivated. Within their communities, Lenca traditionally expect all members to participate in communal efforts.\n\nWhile there has been a growing national acceptance of indigenous rights and culture in both Honduras and El Salvador, the Lenca continue to struggle in both nations over indigenous land rights. In the mid-1990s, indigenous activists formed political groups in order to petition the government over issues of land ownership and indigenous rights. Due to the unresolved land issues, and constitutional amendments of those countries that favor land ownership by large-scale investors and agro-industrialists, there has been a decreasing amount of land for indigenous peoples. Many Lenca men have had to find employment in neighboring cities.\n\nMany Lenca communities still have their communal land. They devote the majority of cultivation to commodity crops raised for export to foreign markets. Most Lenca still use traditional agricultural practices on their own crops, as well as the crops for investors.\n\nDuring the Pre-Columbian Era, its pottery was very similar to that of other Mesoamerican groups, especially the Mayan pottery and several groups from central Mexico. Today Lenca pottery its very distinctive. Handcrafted by Lenca women, the modern traditional pottery is considered an ethnic marking of their culture, as is common among traditional peoples. Many come to be sold at very high prices in the United States and Europe because they are imported and made by hand by these people from Honduras.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, NGO cooperatives of Women artisans were created in order to market their pottery. Because of a desire to increase the profitability of their arts, the cooperatives were encouraged to orient their designs and styles to meet the tastes of urban buyers, and expand their market. In the 21st century, Lenca women are making modern painted pottery (often painted black and white), which is not based on traditional designs. It has been modified to appeal to foreign buyers.\n\nTraditional Lencan pottery is still made by women in the town of Gracias, Honduras and the surrounding villages, most notably La Campa. Visitors can see demonstrations of how the traditional pottery is made. It is usually a dark orange or brick color.\n\nThe contemporary Lenca primarily practice Roman Catholicism, adopted during the force colonial Spanish era after the first war. Similarly to other indigenous groups, their practices often incorporate Pre-Hispanic traditions. In addition, some Lenca communities retain more exclusively indigenous traditions. Similarly to the beliefs of other indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, the Lenca consider sacred mountains and hills to be holy places. Many Lenca still have profound respect and adoration for the sun. Their main gods where, Ilanguipuca (great father), Itanipuca (great mother) and Icelacam (god of time).\n\nAmong traditional indigenous practices are some associated with cultivation and harvest of crops. During different crop seasons, for instance, Lenca men participate in ceremonies where they consume \"chicha\" and burn incense.\n\n\"Guancasco\" is the annual ceremony by which neighboring communities, usually two, gather to establish reciprocal obligations in order to confirm peace and friendship. The \"guancascos\" take many forms and have adopted many Catholic representations. But they also include traditional customs and representations. Processions and elaborate exchanges of greetings, and Honduran folk dancing are performed for the statue of the patron saint of the town. Towns in central and west Honduras, such as Yamaranguila, La Campa, La Paz and Tencoa, all host the annual celebration.\n\nIn the Lenca Putum story it is said that Aku created everything.\n\nUntil recently, archaeological research and investigation of Lenca settlements had been limited. More attention had been given to colonial-era settlements influenced by Europeans, in studies of how the cultures affected each other. In addition, many of the indigenous sites are isolated and difficult to access. Surface evidence in rural areas reveal that pre-Columbian indigenous settlements existed in many regions. Researchers may have difficulty conducting scientific excavations because the sites are found in agricultural fields under cultivation. Many surface-visible earthwork mounds have been damaged from being plowed over by rural farmers.\n\nThe evidence for pre-Columbian Lenca has come from research and excavation of several sites in Honduras and El Salvador. It shows that Lenca occupation was characterized by a relatively continuous pattern of growth, with some fluctuations.\n\nThe Comayagua Valley is located at the highland basin linking the Pacific and Caribbean drainage systems of Honduras. The valley provides evidence for a rich setting of cross-cultural relationships and Lenca settlements. According to Boyd Dixon, research in the area has revealed a complex history spanning approximately 2500 years, from the early pre-classic period to the Spanish Conquest of 1537. Prehistoric Lenca settlements were typically located along major rivers, for access to water for drinking and washing, and to waterways for transportation. The lowlands were typically fertile areas for cultivation. They built relatively small monumental public structures, which were few in number, except for military fortifications. Most constructions were made of adobe rather than stone.\n\nIn his research of the Comayagua Valley region, Dixon finds evidence of large quantities of cross-cultural relationships; many artifacts have been found that show settlements were linked through ceramics. The production of Usulua Polychrome ceramics hase been shown to link Lenca settlements with neighboring chiefdoms during the classic period. The Lenca sites of Yarumela, Los Naranjos in Honduras, and Quelepa in El Salvador, all contain evidence of the Usulután-style ceramics.\n\nYarumela is an archaeological site believed to be a primary Lenca center within the Comayagua Valley during the middle and late formative periods. The site contained a large primary residential center several times the size of its neighboring settlements, which were secondary centers in the region. It was most likely established here because of its proximity to some of the major floodplains in the valley, which fertile soil was cultivated for agriculture. The pattern and scale of the late pre-classic settlements suggests an existence of a ranked society. All corners of the basin were located within a half-day walk of Yarumela.\n\nOther features found in the area are at the sites of Los Naranjos, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, each dominated by a single, constructed earthen mound. Many other sites appear to share site-planning principles and structural forms from these examples, having large, open, flat plazas, leveled by manual grading, and dominated by a massive two- to three- tiered pyramidal earthwork mound.\n\nQuelepa is a major site in eastern El Salvador. Its pottery shows strong similarities to ceramics found in central western El Salvador and the Maya highlands. Archaeologists speculate that Quelepa was settled by Lenca speakers from Honduras. Population pressure may have prompted their migrations to new territory.\n\nSince the late 20th century, scholars have focused on researching and exploring settlement patterns of the Lenca, in order to fill out the chronological framework for the people in the long pre-Columbian era. Research continues and such new evidence is helping to fill in the understanding of indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nLenca heritage tourism is expanding. It has encouraged attention to indigenous Lenca traditions and culture, especially in Honduras. The Honduran Tourism Institute, along with the United Nations Development Program, has developed a cultural heritage project dedicated to the Lenca and their culture, called \"La Ruta Lenca\". This tourist route passes through a series of rural towns in southwestern Honduras within traditional Lenca territory. The route has designated stops in the departments of Intibuca, La Paz, Lempira, and adjacent valleys. Stops include La Campa, where traditional Lenca pottery is handcrafted by a cooperative; the archaeological sites of Los Naranjos and Yarumela; the town of Gracias, and other towns with Lenca heritage. The development of \"La Ruta Lenca\" was designed to attract tourist money to Lenca communities and to encourage preservation of remaining indigenous cultural practices by increasing the economic return for artisans and providing new markets. The project has gained some successes.\n\nMembers of the Lenca community have taken larger national roles since the late 20th century, primarily in the areas of human and land rights for the indigenous peoples, which are seen as inextricably linked. They have also been active on a variety of environmental issues, particularly trying to protect their territories against major development projects that would alter their lands and ecology. Berta Cáceres was an important leader of the Lenca and founder of the Civic Council of Indigenous and Popular Organizations of Honduras (COPINH). Cáceres strongly protested the development of the DESA Agua Zarca Hydro Project and dam on the Gualcarque River in Honduras. She was discovered murdered at her home on 3 March 2016.\n\nCáceres had won the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize for her work with the Lenca and leadership in the environmental movements. A few weeks after her murder major international investors, the Netherlands Development Finance Co. (FMO) and FinnFund, announced they would suspend funding for the Agua Zarca project.\n\n\"In a news report published on June 21, a former soldier of Honduras’ Inter-Institutional Security Force (known as Fusina) alleged that Cáceres’ name, along with other environmentalists in Honduras, appeared on a military hit list.\"\n\nActivism against such major developments has continued to be life-threatening for indigenous people. On July 7, 2016, the body of Lesiba Yaneth, another Lenca activist, was found; she had been murdered the previous day in the Matamulas sector of Marcala. Numerous other women activists also have been murdered in Honduras.\n\nThe police initially claimed Yaneth was killed in the course of a robbery of her professional bike. However, she was active in COPINH, and fellow members and supporters believe that she was assassinated for her political work. United Nations and European Union officials protested her death. She had opposed the Aurora hydroelectric project, planned in the municipality of San José, La Paz. This project was very important to the government; \"the vice-president of the National Congress, Gladys Aurora Lopez,\" was reported as having \"direct ties\" to it. On July 8, Secretary of Security Julian Pacheco said that the government had failed to provide adequate protection for Cáceres, who had received death threats previously. The police and military are expected to protect human rights defenders. Three suspects were arrested within a week in the Yaneth murder..\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cecil was taken to the Democratic Republic of the Congo when he was still very young, but was evacuated two years after Mobutu Sese Seko's coup d'état. He studied at Bedales School in Hampshire, England. In 1980 he began his studies in Engineering Manufacture and Management at Manchester University, where he met student Richard Turner who invited him to write text adventures for Artic Computing. After completing his degree in 1985 he decided to continue his career in game development and became director of Artic. The following year he established Paragon Programming, a game development company working with British publisher U.S. Gold. In 1987 he moved into publishing as a software development manager for U.S. Gold. A year later he was approached by Activision and was offered the position of manager of their European development studio.\n\nIn 1990, Cecil founded Revolution along with Tony Warriner, David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. Originally located in Hull, the company moved to York in 1994. Cecil then became Revolution's managing director and focussed on writing and design. For the company's first title, Lure of the Temptress (1992), Cecil conceived with others an innovative game engine, called Virtual Theatre, that was designed by Tony Warriner. Cecil's interest in cinematic techniques and technical developments became manifest in and the games that followed. \"Broken Sword 1\" was a 2D point-and-click game, but by the end of the nineties Cecil took the company to 3D games with direct control, including (2003). In 2004 with no project at hand, he, as head of the company, let everyone go. Nevertheless, he continued to design by implementing the so-called \"Hollywood model\", in which each time a team is assembled to create a movie. For the fourth \"Broken Sword\" game, \"\", he decided to work with Sumo Digital. By the end of the decade new developments made it possible to renew the back catalogue of Revolution, and in 2011 Develop ranked Revolution Software among the top 50 most successful development studios in the world. \n\n\"Lure of the Temptress\" was followed by a string of critically and commercially successful adventure games, including Beneath a Steel Sky, the Broken Sword series, \"In Cold Blood\" and \"Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado\". \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" and the \"Broken Sword\" series are often referred to as one of the best adventures of all time, appearing on numerous \"top\" adventure game lists and receiving several awards and nominations. Sales of Broken Sword 1 and 2 have made over US$100 million and have sold over 3 million copies worldwide. New versions were downloaded by over 4 million people in 2011. Cecil worked on various adventure games outside Revolution, including \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"\".\n\nCecil is currently operating as managing director of Revolution. He co-founded Game Republic in 2003 and has been a director on the board. He is a member of the advisory committee for the renewed Game Republic, and has been on the advisory panel of the Edinburgh Interactive Entertainment Festival. He is member of the advisory panel of the \"Evolve\" and \"Develop\" Conference, a board member of Screen Yorkshire, and a member of Skillset's Computer Games Skills Council. He regularly talks at events and to mainstream press about creative and commercial aspects of the gaming industry. In 2006, he was awarded the status of \"Development Legend\" by Develop. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the video game industry.\n\nAs a baby, Charles lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where his father David was sent by Unilever to reconstruct their accounting systems. When Cecil was two and his mother Veronica was about to give birth to his sister, they were evacuated after Mobutu Sese Seko's coup d'état.\nHis taste for adventure may have started in those days, and the Congo would become a background in one of his games. Cecil was then educated at Bedales School in Hampshire, England. In 1980 he began his studies in mechanical engineering at Manchester University. On a course sponsored by Ford he met student Richard Turner, who invited him to write some text adventure games for his new computer game company, Artic Computing. He decided to take up on the invitation, for like all students, he needed beer money. In those days, game development was the true period of being the auteur of a game, of bedroom coders, of direct contact with the customers, a relation that was lost when big game publishers took over. Cecil's first game became \"Adventure B\" (aka \"Inca Curse\", published in 1981). It was followed by \"Adventure C\" (aka \"Ship of Doom\", published in 1982) and \"Adventure D\" (aka \"Espionage Island\", published in 1982). Each were highly successful on the Sinclair ZX81, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad formats.\n\nAfter completing his degree in 1985, Cecil decided to continue his career in game development and became director of Artic Computing. When Artic closed down, he established \"Paragon Programming\" (1986), a game development company working with major British publisher U.S. Gold. In 1987 he left development and moved into publishing as Software Development Manager for U.S. Gold. One year later he was approached by Activision and was offered the position of manager of their European development studio. Noirin Carmody, who would become his wife, was general manager at Activision, where she was responsible for establishing the Sierra name in Europe.\n\nIn 1989, when Cecil was still working at Activison, he decided to set up his own development studio. He contacted Tony Warriner, who had worked with him at Artic Computing and Paragon Programming, and Warriner brought in a fellow programmer, David Sykes. Together with Noirin Carmody, his then-partner and General Manager at Activision UK, they founded Revolution Software (March 1990). The company was originally located in Hull, but moved to York in 1994. Besides becoming Revolution's managing director, Cecil would focus from the start on writing and design. At that time the graphic adventure genre was dominated by LucasArts and Sierra On-Line, and they wanted to create something in between, an adventure game that didn't take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story. For Revolution's first title, Cecil conceived with others an innovative game engine, called Virtual Theatre, and the engine itself was designed by Tony Warriner. The result was Lure of the Temptress (1992), and though it was their first product, it became one of the successful games that would follow. For the second title, Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), often referred to as a cult classic, Cecil contacted comic book artist Dave Gibbons. He had met Gibbons when he was still at Activision, and he admired Gibbons's work on \"Watchmen\". Gibbons became involved in the design of the game, and their collaboration would inspire Cecil's next move.\n\nThe divergence of and distinction between film and video games is one of Cecil's pet subjects, and his interest in cinematic techniques and technical developments would become manifest in Revolution's upcoming titles. He started to hire external talent from the TV and film trades for the big-budget production (1996). Already in the next year the sequel, , was released. By the end of the nineties, when the adventure market changed, he had to change course as well. Instead of the previous games, that were point-and-click adventures, he chose to move to 3D and direct control with In Cold Blood (2000), a narrative driven adventure game with action elements. At the same time a second title, \"Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado\" (2000), was developed after DreamWorks's film The Road to El Dorado. As \"Broken Sword\" was originally intended to be a trilogy, a third episode was planned. Unlike \"In Cold Blood\", that combined 3D characters with pre-rendered graphics, the third Broken Sword game, Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon (2003), became a real-time 3D adventure game, with mild action elements (such as using stealth, climbing, shimmying, and pushing objects). Initially, when he announced that Broken Sword 3 was going to be a 3D game, it caused an outcry by the fans of the series. Cecil had had no choice to adopt 3D though, for when they needed funding in the beginning of 2000, publishers had become obsessed with the idea that everything was going to be 3D. But he had always been keen to move to 3D, as it allowed more special effects and would make the game world more alive. In the same year, he decided to release \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" (and \"Lure of the Temptress\") as freeware and the source code was given to ScummVM. The result was that millions of people played the game for free in a very wide range of devices. It would foreshadow Revolution's bright future. He could have said that as a marketing genius he planned it, but as he stated a few years later, that would have been a dreadful lie. However, some hard years were ahead for the company. Over the years it had grown into about 40 people, but the year after \"Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon\" one of Revolution's projects was cancelled, and he had no other option than let everyone go.\n\nIn May 2004 Cecil announced that Revolution would go \"back to basics,\" which meant that Revolution, that had set itself up as both designer and producer of video games, would focus more closely on design. As he stated in various presentations, the situation was caused by the fact that big publishing companies had been controlling for years the supply and demand side of the game market, and little was left for independent developers. Though publishers made tens of millions on the games, Revolution was losing money on every title they produced. In the new situation, he implemented the so-called \"Hollywood model,\" in which a producer and director come together and assemble a team to create a movie. For the fourth Broken Sword game, (2006), he decided to work with Sumo Digital. They took a number of the former Revolution staff and concentrated on production, while Cecil concentrated on design, story and game play. Because Revolution had received a lot of feedback on the decision to abandon point-and-click, the player was allowed to choose between point-and-click and direct control.\n\nAt the end of the decade things changed by innovations such as broadband, new platforms and digital portals. In the new situation game publishers and other middle-men were no longer needed. Revolution could now start to self-publish and the relation with the audience, a relation that Cecil had always valued, could be restored. In March 2009 was published by Ubisoft for the Wii and DS that included new material. In July 2009 Revolution announced on their website a new division, called Revolution Pocket, together with the first title of the new division, \"Beneath a Steel Sky – Remastered\". In the announcement Cecil stated that the digital revolution had changed the game for developers, and that more titles would follow. He had been contacted by Apple to see if he would consider to bring Revolution's classic titles to the App Store, and Cecil on his turn had contacted Dave Gibbons to work on new editions of \"Beneath a Steel Sky\", \"Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – The Director's Cut\" and \"Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered\" (2010). The release of the first \"Broken Sword\" game was celebrated at the Apple Store in London in February 2010. According to Cecil the digital revolution, and in particular the App Store, saved Revolution. As was announced on Revolution's site in December 2011, the dramatic change enabled Revolution to self-fund their next game. Develop, that ranks development studios based on Metacritic data and chart success, ranked Revolution Software in 2011 among the top 50 most successful development studios in the world.\n\nOn 23 August 2012 Revolution revealed that they were working on a new Broken Sword game entitled and they launched a Kickstarter campaign. Though Cecil was approached by a huge publisher to publish a Broken Sword game, Kickstarter was preferred, because they would be able to control development, finances, and marketing. The project was successfully funded within two weeks.\n\nCecil has worked on various games outside Revolution. He was a consultant for The Collective's \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006). Disney approached him to design a game on \"A Christmas Carol\" (Disney's A Christmas Carol, Disney Interactive Studios/Sumo Digital, 2009), and he became the voice of the narrator.\nA decade earlier he had already been executive producer of \"Disney's Story Studio: Disney's Mulan\", a co-production between Kids Revolution and Disney Interactive (NewKidCo, 1999). He also became executive producer of the BBC/Sumo Digital's episodic adventure game \"\" (2010). The fifth episode (\"The Gunpowder Plot\") won the British Academy Cymru Award 2012.\n\nCecil regularly talks at events and to the press about creative and commercial aspects of the video games industry, and is an ambassador for the Yorkshire and UK games industry in general and of course Revolution in particular. He also teaches, gives masterclasses, acts as judge on game proposals and mentors young game designers.\n\nCecil was a founder of Yorkshire games network Game Republic in 2003, and has been a director on the board. He is a member of the advisory committee for the renewed Game Republic. He has been a member of the steering group and member on the advisory board of Edinburgh Interactive Entertainment Festival, and is on the advisory panel of the \"Evolve\" and Develop Conferences. He is also board member of Screen Yorkshire, member of Skillset's Computer Games Skills Council, and member of the BFI Board of Governors.\n\nIn 2006 Cecil was awarded the status of Development Legend by Develop, Europe's leading development magazine. In 2010 Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, asked Cecil (together with Ian Livingstone) to be part of an independent review to assess which university courses best prepare graduates with the skills to succeed in the games industry. Cecil was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the computer games industry.\n\nRevolution Software quickly established itself as Europe's leading adventure game developer with a string of titles, which have been critically and commercially successful. Clients included Sony Computer Entertainment, Disney, DreamWorks, Virgin Interactive, Sierra Entertainment (Vivendi), Ubisoft, and THQ.\n\nTheir first two titles, \"Lure of the Temptress\" (published in 1992) and \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" (published in 1994) went straight to number one in the GALLUP charts in the UK and topped the charts across most of Europe. Revolution's next title, \"Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars\" (published in 1996) and its sequel \"Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror\" (published in 1997) both, in turn, received numerous awards such as best adventure game of the year as well as the best adventure game to date.\n\nSales of \"Broken Sword 1\" and \"2\" have made over US$100 million and have sold over three million copies worldwide. Revolution's next game \"In Cold Blood\", published in 2000 by Sony Computer Entertainment, focused on telling stories through action based gameplay and was met with mixed reviews, though it sold very well. \"Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado\", based on the DreamWorks film \"The Road to El Dorado\", was released in late 2000. In 2002 \"Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars\" was also published on the Game Boy Advance and in 2006 the game was also published for the Palm OS and Pocket PC.\n\nThe third game in the \"Broken Sword\" series, \"Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon\", was released in November 2003 for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The game\nsold the same as the previous Broken Sword games and was nominated for 3 BAFTA awards and Best Writing at the Game Developers Conference in 2004. The fourth game, \"Broken Sword : The Angel of Death\" was released on PC in September 2006.\n\nIn 2009 was released for the Wii and DS, followed by \"Beneath a Steel Sky – Remastered\" for the iPhone. The \"Director's Cut\" was also released for iOS, Mac, PC (2010), and Android (2012). The game was nominated in the category Story at the British Academy Video Games Awards in 2010.\" Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered\" was released in 2010 (iOS, Mac, PC). In 2011 the two Broken Sword games were downloaded by over 4 million people.\n\nCharles Cecil (London, 11 August 1962) and Noirin Carmody have two children, Ciara and David, who are credited in \"Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon\" and the new editions of \"Beneath a Steel Sky\" and \"Broken Sword\". They all love games, and as his wife works with him as well, family life and work life are completely intertwined. Even their holidays are connected to game design, as they visit places that could feature in a game. Cecil loves history and physics-based science, but also enjoys physical activity, like rowing, competing in regattas, football, and tennis.\n\nCecil believes that game design involves a different creative process as compared to traditional writing. As a writer of a linear story, \"all they do is to write the script,\" he said. \"In game design, the writer should think about the gameplay and background story first before developing any of the characters. However, the constraints of an interactive medium is no excuse for a poorly constructed story, the big thing is that we have a different medium. We have to accept that we have not only huge advantages in the interactive medium but also big constraints. And these constraints often lead to some really shitty stories. And that’s why so many games have bad stories.\"\n\nCecil is also very serious when doing this research to develop games that have strong ties to historic locales and myths, \"I take the historical research and research of our locations very seriously and will generally visit the locations to undertake recces. Of course this is almost always a pleasure – the games aim to feature locations that are exciting and interesting.\" In the same interview he stated that the name Broken Sword may have been chosen because it is a symbol of peace. He also added that it might have been a fate of history that this name was chosen: \"I live in the city of York in England and a few years ago a statue of Constantine the Great was erected next to the cathedral to commemorate his coronation in the city in 306AD. The statue depicts Constantine sitting atop a broken sword; it seemed a fun coincidence, or perhaps it is down to fate.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1848261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848261", "title": "Light-sport aircraft", "text": "Light-sport aircraft\n\nA light-sport aircraft (LSA), or light sport aircraft, is a fairly new category of small, lightweight aircraft that are simple to fly. LSAs tend to be heavier and more sophisticated than ultralight (aka \"microlight\") aircraft, but LSA restrictions on weight and performance separates the category from established GA aircraft. There is no standard worldwide description of an LSA .\n\nNational aviation authorities in different countries have their own particular specifications and regulations which define the LSA category.\n\nFor example, in Australia the Civil Aviation Safety Authority defines a light-sport aircraft as a heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft, other than a helicopter, with a maximum gross takeoff weight of not more than for lighter-than-air craft; for heavier-than-air craft not intended for operation on water; or for aircraft intended for operation on water. It must have a maximum stall speed of in landing configuration; a maximum of two seats; there is no limit on maximum speed unless it is a glider, which is limited to Vne 135 kn CAS; fixed undercarriage (except for amphibious aircraft, which may have repositionable gear, and gliders, which may have retractable gear); an unpressurized cabin; and a single non-turbine engine driving a propeller if it is a powered aircraft.\n\nIn the United States, several distinct groups of aircraft may be flown as light-sport. Existing certificated aircraft and experimental, amateur-built aircraft that fall within the definition listed in 14CFR1.1 are acceptable, as are aircraft built to an industry consensus standard rather than FAA airworthiness requirements. The accepted consensus standard is defined by ASTM International Technical Committee F37. Aircraft built to the consensus standard may be factory-built and sold with a special airworthiness certification (S-LSA) or may be assembled from a kit under the experimental rules (E-LSA) under experimental airworthiness. A company must have produced and certified at least one S-LSA in order to be permitted to sell E-LSA kits of the same model. E-LSA kits are not subject to the normal experimental amateur built (E-AB) requirement 14 CFR 21.191 which identifies an aircraft, the \"major portion of which has been fabricated and assembled by persons who undertook the construction project solely for their own education or recreation.\"\n\nThe FAA defines a light sport aircraft as an aircraft, other than a helicopter or Powered-lift, that since its original certification, has continued to meet the following:\n\n\nSeveral different kinds of aircraft may be certificated as LSA. Airplanes (both powered and gliders), rotorcraft (gyroplanes only, not helicopters), powered parachutes, weight-shift control aeroplanes (commonly known as trikes), and lighter-than-air craft (free balloons and airships) may all be certificated as LSA if they fall within the weight and other guidelines established by the local governing authority.\n\nThe US definition of an LSA is similar to some other countries' definition of \"microlight\" or \"ultralight\" aircraft. Except for the LSA's relatively generous MTOW of 1320 pounds, the other countries' microlight definitions are typically less restrictive, not limiting airspeed or the use of variable-pitch propellers.\n\nBy contrast, the US FAA has a separate definition of ultralight aircraft defined in Federal Aviation Regulations. Aircraft falling within the US ultralight specifications are extremely lightweight (less than 254 pounds if powered, or 155 pounds if unpowered), are intended for manned operation by a single occupant, have a fuel capacity of five US gallons (about 19 litres) or less, a maximum calibrated airspeed of not more than , and a maximum stall speed of not more than . Ultralight aircraft in the US do not require pilot licensing, medical certification, or aircraft registration.\n\nAircraft certified as light-sport aircraft exceed the limitations defined for ultralight aircraft and require that the pilot possess, at a minimum, a sport pilot certificate. Among these aircraft were found those that were specifically designed to meet the LSA requirements, as well as overweight ultralights (commonly known as \"fat ultralights\") that previously were operated in technical violation of 14 CFR 103.\n\nIn addition to aircraft specifically designed to meet the LSA requirements, certain certificated aircraft, such as the original Piper Cub, happen to fall within the definition of a light-sport aircraft and can be operated by individuals holding FAA sport pilot certificates. The aircraft can not be re-certificated as LSA, however: although sport pilots may operate conventionally certificated aircraft that fall within the definition of an LSA, the aircraft themselves continue to be certificated in their original categories.\n\nSeveral designers and manufacturers of experimental aircraft kits have developed models that are compliant with the light-sport aircraft rules.\n\nIn June 2012 the FAA indicated that they would re-visit the LSA program after their own studies indicated that \"the majority\" of LSA manufacturers they had inspected failed to show that they were in compliance with the standards. The FAA announcement said that as a result the \"original policy of reliance on manufacturers' Statements of Compliance\" ... \"should be reconsidered.\" AOPA points out that this is a normal development of a maturing standard and does not expect any significant changes in the rules, only more scrutiny by FAA to assure compliance.\n\nAircraft that met light-sport requirements when the rules were announced appear in FAA's list\nSome additional models of S-LSA, E-LSA and E-AB aircraft that meet light-sport requirements are listed here.\n\nIn June 2011, the European Aviation Safety Agency published CS-LSA \"Certification Specifications for Light Sport Aeroplanes\". This introduced a new category of manufactured sport aeroplanes similar to the light-sport category found in the USA and elsewhere.\n\nA new certification category for 'Light Sport Aircraft' came into effect on 7 January 2006. This category does not replace the previous categories, but created a new category with the following characteristics:\n\n\nLight-sport aircraft can be factory-manufactured aircraft or kits for amateur-building.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1848268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848268", "title": "Lake Parramatta", "text": "Lake Parramatta\n\nLake Parramatta is a heritage-listed man-made reservoir and a recreational area located in North Parramatta, City of Parramatta, in the Western Sydney region of New South Wales, Australia. The masonry arch-walled dam across Hunts Creek was completed in 1856 to supply water for domestic purposes; and was operational until 1909. The dam has since been decommissioned and the lake and the surrounding nature reserve are a popular recreational area.\n\nThe precinct contains a nature reserve, the largest bushland remnant surviving in the Parramatta LGA. The catchment area for Lake Parramatta is bounded by North Rocks Road, Pennant Hills Road and Hunts Creek. The height of the dam wall is and it creates a lake with a maximum storage capacity of , with a surface area of approximately .\n\nThe dam was the twelfth engineered dam built since Roman times 100BC, the first in Australia, and the second arch built universally that involved calculations for its construction. Water from this dam was not reticulated until 1881 when it was required to augment the then dwindling water supply. The dam wall is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register in recognition of its significance relating to dam technology in Australia arch dams worldwide; and has an indicative listing on the Register of the National Estate. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 March 2012.\n\nOn 5 December 2012 the Governor proclaimed Lake Parramatta Reserve as a 'Wildlife Refuge’ under Section 68 of the \"National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974\". The proclamation was in recognition of the diversity of wildlife and threatened species which occur in the reserve. Swimming in Lake Parramatta was permitted between 1920 and 1940; and after a prolonged period of closure due to poor water quality, was reopened to the public in 2015. Entry to the reserve is from Lackey Street, .\n\nThe traditional custodians of the land surrounding Lake Parramatta are the Burramatagal and Bidjigal clans of the Darug people, an Aboriginal kinship group of Indigenous Australians. There is evidence of Aboriginal occupation within the boundaries of Lake Parramatta Reserve in the form of remnant shelters, hand stencils, flaking scars and deposits. It is possible that other sites were inundated with the construction of the dam in the 1850s.\n\nThe area was important to Aboriginal people because of the abundant fresh water and diverse range of food types. Records from 1804 exist of the Reserve's use as a pleasure ground, specifically around Hunts Creek.\n\nFrom 1788 to 1909, Parramatta depended on the Parramatta River for its water supply. The history of public supply began in 1815 when a well was sunk for public use. In 1818 Governor Macquarie ordered a dam to be built across the Parramatta River. It was called the Town Dam and held about 30 million gallons of water (136 kL) which was delivered to houses and factories by privately operated water carts. This dam still stands near Lennox Bridge and retains the pond through Parramatta Park. A second dam was built near the present Cumberland Hospital in 1831.\n\nPollution and recurrent shortages led to agitation for a larger and purer supply. By 1847 the population had increased to 4500, and the government was asked to provide the district with a \"full supply of pure and wholesome water\". Unfortunately, due to other more pressing demands, the government was unable to comply. Agitation continued and two factions developed: one advocating a dam on Toongabbie Creek, the other favouring Hunts Creek. In 1849 a large public meeting of citizens petitioned the Governor for a grant of pounds sterling 3000 ($6000) to provide a wholesome water supply. A few weeks later the Legislative Council granted pounds sterling 1000 ($2000) to the citizens of Parramatta who were expected to find the other pounds sterling 2000 ($4000). The Government grant was later increased to pounds sterling 3000 ($6000).\n\nA Committee of Water Commissioners (the Water Committee) comprising selected Parramatta citizens was appointed by the Governor to carry out the work. The debate over the site continued until the Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell recommended the selection of Hunts Creek. Plans and specifications were prepared and in May 1851 the Water Committee approved the construction of a \"circular\" (arch) dam.\n\nThe tender of Mr John Stewart for this work was accepted but, after starting work, he withdrew from the contract, citing undue interference by the Water Committee. A second contractor failed and a third also withdrew from the task. The Water Committee reverted to the Toongabbie Scheme, and then resigned.\n\nA new Water Committee changed back to Hunts Creek and had plans prepared by Captain Percy Simpson who was also appointed Engineer of Works. Later supervision of the work was handed over to Edward Orpen Moriarty, a civil engineer in private practice. In November 1853, the tender of W. Randle was accepted. Before dam construction could begin, it was necessary to cut and shape stones from the quarry and to excavate steps in the abutments to receive each course of masonry. By June 1855, sufficient work had been done for the first stone to be ceremoniously laid in the dam wall. This was done by James Pye. He was a member of both Water Committees and his support for the Hunts Creek Scheme had never wavered.\n\nThe contractor employed about 150 men and worked them on day and night shifts. By August 1855 the available funds had been expended and work was suspended. When more money was allocated the next year, work resumed and the dam was completed in September 1856, at a cost of about pounds sterling 17 000 ($34,000).\n\nThe cylindrical arch dam had a vertical water face with a radius of 240 ft (73m). The wall was 41 ft (12.5m) high, 15 ft (4.5m) thick at the base and 8 ft (2.4m) thick at the crest, with an 0.3m high parapet. It was constructed of solid sandstone quarried from the creek. Each block was carefully dressed to accurate dimensions and laid in courses 0.6m high. The dam wall extended about 4m into the abutments on each bank.\n\nAt Moriarty's suggestion the stones were bonded together with cement mortar to ensure watertightness. Two different cements were imported from England. Roman cement was used where the joints were in contact with the water, and Portland cement elsewhere.\n\nFor the next 25 years the dam was only used to replenish the Town Dam and as a bathing pool for boys. Plans to reticulate water to the town awaited the granting of appropriate powers to the local authority and the funding of a pump house, filter beds and pipes. This process was not completed until 1881.\n\nBy the mid-1890s the population of Parramatta had grown to 13 000, and a succession of drought years emptied the reservoir on several occasions. Increased storage became a necessity, and in 1898 C. W. Darley recommended the raising of the wall by 6 ft (2 m). The height was actually increased by 11 feet (3.3 m) in the form of a concrete arch founded on the stonework. The original spillway was a channel excavated at the northern abutment of the dam. This spillway was closed when the dam was raised, and provision was made for floods to pass over the raised dam crest, that incorporated a syphon spillway for low flows.\n\nIn 1909 the supply was discontinued when Parramatta was connected to the Sydney water system. During the 1920s and 1930s, the reserve served as a popular picnic and bathing spot, that even required its own life saving club. The Hunts Creek water reserve was later vested in Parramatta Council as a public recreation area and is known as the Lake Parramatta Reserve.\n\nDuring the 1960s there were a number of drowning in the lake - because the water was very warm and muddy at the surface and very cold underneath - causing cramps - in a time when the average person did not swim so well.\n\nThe dam is located on Hunts Creek, within Lake Parramatta Reserve, 1.5 km north of the centre of the City of Parramatta.\n\nLake Parramatta Dam is a cylindrical masonry arch dam with a vertical water face that has a radius of 240 ft (73m). The original (1856) wall was 41 ft (12.5m) high, 15 ft (4.5m) thick at the base and 8 ft (2.4m) thick at the crest, with a 0.3m high parapet.\n\nIt was constructed of solid sandstone quarried from the creek. Each block was carefully dressed to accurate dimensions and laid in courses 0.6m high. The dam wall extended about 4m into the abutments on each bank.\n\nThe stone blocks were bonded together with cement mortar to ensure water-tightness. Two different cements were imported from England. Roman cement was used where the joints were in contact with the water and Portland cement elsewhere.\n\nThe original spillway was a channel excavated at the northern abutment of the dam. This spillway was closed when the dam was raised, and provision was made for floods to pass over the raised dam crest that incorporated a syphon spillway for low flows.\n\nConsidering its age, the condition of Lake Parramatta Dam is very good. The original sandstone masonry blocks are in excellent condition with no significant signs of weathering or spalling. Likewise the condition of the mortar is also very good with only minor leakage emanating in various locations.\n\nThe integrity of the dam is high; it retains water and is safe.\n\nThe reserve comprises of bush and parkland that is located within of the Parramatta central business district. The main watercourse entering the reserve, Hunts Creek, is a tributary of the Parramatta River. The reserve's boundaries to the west are cut off by suburban development along North Rocks Road, to the north by Hunts Creek, to the east by the private bushland and playing fields of The King's School, and to the south by James Ruse Drive.\n\nGeologically, Lake Parramatta is located on the margins of Wianamatta shale and Hawkesbury sandstone formations, with a resulting variation in vegetation communities. Vegetation communities present at the site include sandstone blue-gum forests, iron bark, Cumberland Plain Woodland vegetation communities and some coastal species such as \"Banksia serrata\".\n\nWhen the water supply became insufficient for the growing demands, in 1909 Lake Parramatta was entrusted with its surrounds to the City of Parramatta as a recreational area. Between 1920 and 1940, the lake was a popular swimming hole with at one point the largest inland freshwater lifesaving club in Australia. By the late 1980s, the lack of consistently good water quality led to \"No Swimming\" signs being erected.\n\nIn 2006, the City of Parramtta reopened Lake Parramatta to limited swimming. After investigating different options the Council decided to allow swimming only on special event days. The first of these, called the Freshwater Festival, was held on 3 December 2006 featuring competitive swimming races from 10am till 12pm and public swimming from 1pm till 3pm, supervised by the Royal Life Saving Society Australia.\n\nOn Saturday 24 January 2015, Lake Parramatta officially became a designated swimming spot, with an area marked out with buoys for swimming and lifeguards present between 9am and 5pm on weekends and public holidays in the warm season. The reserve surrounding the swimming area includes recreational walking tracks within the scenic bushland, barbecue areas, children's playgrounds and a restaurant. Furthermore, visitors can also hire boats to explore the natural habitat.\n\nRoad access to Lake Parramatta is by a convoluted journey down a number of innocuous suburban streets that means the lake is a feature unknown and elusive to a great many Sydneysiders – tucked away as it is. Visitors would take Bourke Street off Church Street, Parramatta. Then onto Lacey Street then Illawong Drive, passing under James Ruse Drive. Illawong Drive passes into the reserve and follows the eastern edge of the lake. When travelling by bus from the Parramatta Bus Interchange, the Hillsbus route 609 is an option. Sydney Trains nearest station is at Parramatta.\n\nLake Parramatta Dam was the first large dam built in Australia. It was \"completed in 1856, practically simultaneously with and probably independently of the modern arch dams in Europe\". As such the dam has an important place in the history of both dam technology in Australia and in the design of arch dams in the world.\n\nIn detail:\n\nLake Parramatta was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 March 2012 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nLake Parramatta Dam is associated with four persons of state significance in the mid to late nineteenth century colony of NSW: Captain Percy Simpson, Edward Orpen Moriarty, Cecil West Darley and William Randle (Randall).\n\nSimpson was initially appointed engineer for the dam works and is believed to be the designer.\nAs a free migrant to NSW in 1822, Simpson gained experience managing convicts as the commandant of the convict agricultural settlement at Wellington (1823). In 1828 he was appointed as an assistant surveyor of roads and bridges and from 1828-32 he supervised the construction of the Devine's Hill section of the technically challenging Great North Road at Wisemans Ferry where he developed his skills in the use of ashlar retaining walls. This section of the Great North Road is testament to Simpson's engineering skills and his supervision of convict labour (some working in irons) to a very high standard of construction.\nSimpson's ability to manage convict labour and his administrative and engineering skills were recognised by successive governors. Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell knew of \"no other officer in the Colony to whom I could with better expectation as to the results, intrust any work connected with the formation of roads, bridges and streets.\". The challenging road from Lapstone Hill to Mitchell's Pass in the Blue Mountains, bridges at Wollombi, Lansdowne and Duck Creek and the Queens Wharf at Sydney Cove are all attributed to Simpson.\nFollowing colonial administrative positions in the 1830s, Simpson returned to Ireland in the 1840s to work on railways. He returned to Sydney in 1850 as a civil engineer and was involved in the radical new design and construction of Lake Parramatta Dam. He remained in Parramatta in the 1850s and 1860s serving as a district registrar.\n\nAbout 1849 Moriarty commenced private practice in Sydney as a civil engineer, carrying out various schemes including the development of coal mines at Wollongong; design of the first Pyrmont bridge across Darling Harbour, timber bridges over the Murrumbidgee at Wagga Wagga and the Nepean at Richmond, and supervision of Lake Parramatta Dam. In the latter capacity he may have modified the dam design and recommended the use of specific mortars in the joints between the stones.\nIn October 1858 he was appointed Engineer-in-Chief for Harbours and River Navigation in the Public Works Department which he directed until he retired in December 1888. During that time he carried out many important harbour and hydraulic works including the initial development of the Port of Newcastle. Other works included construction and excavation of breakwaters, basins and docks at Wollongong and Kiama; improvements at the mouth of the Clarence and Richmond Rivers; a harbour of refuge at Trial Bay; extensive wharfage in Sydney harbour, and enlargement of the Sutherland Dock at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Moriarty was also significantly involved in devising the Upper Nepean Scheme for Sydney.\n\nCecil Darley became Principal Assistant Engineer Harbours & Rivers of the Public Works Department in 1881, under Moriarty. Under him \"many of the water supply works in the Colony were constructed\". Darley succeeded Moriarty as Engineer-in-Chief Harbours & Rivers in 1889 and became Chief Engineer PWD in 1896. In 1898 Moriarty recommended a raising of Lake Parramatta Dam. He is renowned for the thirteen thin arch dams built to his direction around the beginning of the 20th century and described by Wade.\n\nWilliam Randle was responsible for construction of the first steam railway in Australia (in Melbourne) and for building Fort Denison (sandstone masonry) in Sydney Harbour. He built the first railway in NSW from Sydney to Parramatta where he achieved outstanding progress using \"modern methods\" of shifting spoil in wagons on rails. His superior and innovative construction skills were again demonstrated in constructing Lake Parramatta Dam.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nLake Parramatta Dam has state significance for its technical innovation and achievement because:\n\n\"The commencement already made, consists in the formation of a timber frame over the entire site of the dam, running at the height of thirty three feet; along this a travelling-jenny travels, and the operations of raising the blocks and lowering them in their destination are performed with the utmost precision. A weight of twenty tons may be moved by this machinery, but the power applied in the present work will probably range between two and six tons. The labour is now directed to the excavation of the sides of the ravine to form footings and abutments for the dam wall, and also to preparing and laying the courses. The circumstances of the water being at its lowest ebb is very propitious to the operations...\"\nAssociated with this was a rail line to transport the masonry blocks from the quarry to the gantry at the dam.\n\n\nThe place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe Institution of Engineers has declared Lake Parramatta Dam a National Engineering Landmark.\n\nThe completion of Lake Parramatta Dam in 1856 was an important event for those living in the Parramatta district. The previous water source, the Town Dam on the Parramatta River, was polluted, unreliable and unhygienic, whereas the new source supplied pure and wholesome water, and its storage enabled the supply to continue through the drought years. The breakthrough came when the citizens finally persuaded the government to fund the cost. Twenty-five years later a pump house and reticulation system brought the water from the dam to the streets of Parramatta.\n\nThe dam is now a central feature of Lake Parramatta Reserve park which is visited regularly by tourists and picnickers. The birdlife (mainly waterfowl) and native fauna around the dam and fish in the lake are pleasant distractions from the otherwise drab suburbia of western Sydney. A nature trail follows the perimeter of part of the storage.\n\nThe Reserve forms an attractive recreation area in the Parramatta district. The amenities include a small beach, barbecues, picnic areas, car parking facilities, a kiosk, and children's playgrounds. The most popular activity is bushwalking, and there is also an orienteering track within the Reserve.\n\nFollowing on representations made by the Wild Life Preservation Society of Australia, the Parramatta Council in 1958 adopted the bushland area and the maintenance and development of the recreation area as one of its objectives. The Council also applied to the Fauna Protection Panel to have the area proclaimed a Complete Sanctuary and it became the first wildlife refuge in the Sydney area.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nLake Parramatta Dam is a rarity.\nIt is the only masonry arch dam in Australia.\nIt was the first large dam, one year ahead of Melbourne's Yan Yean Dam. (Strictly speaking, large dams are over 15m high above lowest foundation level, which Lake Parramatta Dam became in 1898, after a 3.3m raising).\nIt was the first arch dam and 40 years passed before the next arch dam was built (Lithgow Dam, 1896).\n\nWhile Lake Parramatta Dam is the only masonry arch dam in Australia, it is a cylindrical arch dam of which many more were built, but in concrete and several decades later (13 in NSW and one in SA). Consequently, Lake Parramatta Dam cannot be compared with any similar dams in Australia. As such it set a valuable design precedent.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe dam is a fine example of its type. Its thin section and appropriate curvature provided Parramatta with an economical dam. The original stone work is clearly visible from the downstream side and remains in good condition. The dam demonstrates the application of the stonemason's craft to a water-retaining structure of some magnitude. The choice of Roman cement mortar bonding between the stones has proved to be an inspired choice, having withstood 140 years of use with a minimum of leakage or deterioration.\n\nThe essential character of the dam was retained when the raising was carried out in 1898. Although concrete was the chosen material, it was sympathetically applied. The arch form was maintained, the stones courses were simulated and the original stonework remained in full view, reminiscent of Fort Denison in Sydney Harbour.\n\nConsidering its age, the condition of Lake Parramatta Dam is very good. The integrity of the original sandstone masonry blocks is excellent, with no significant signs of weathering or spalling. Likewise the condition of the mortar is also very good with only minor leakage emanating in various locations.\n\n\n\n"}

He also worked for Lucha Underground as a color commentator. Hodgkinson is also member of the citizen crime patrol organization Guardian Angels, acting as head of the group's chapter in Mexico City.\n\nHodgkinson has wrestled for various wrestling promotions. In the United States, he is best known for his time in World Championship Wrestling, where he held the WCW World Tag Team Championship with The Great Muta. However, his greatest success was achieved in Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre during the 1990s. In his professional wrestling career, Hodgkinson is a three-time World Champion having won the NWE World Heavyweight Championship once, the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship once, and the UWA World Heavyweight Championship once.\n\nHodgkinson used to be a bodyguard for the pop group Milli Vanilli. Prior to wrestling, Hodgkinson was an ice hockey goaltending prospect who was drafted by the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League.\n\nHodgkinson got his start in the business working for International Wrestling out of Montreal, Quebec. He often set up the ring before events and would train with the wrestlers before their matches. He made his debut as a jobber in 1984 at the age of 16 with little training, although he has credited Abdullah the Butcher as his trainer. He wrestled under the names Ian Richards and Gene Anderson during this time.\n\nAfter a few years in Montreal, in 1991, Hodgkinson headed down to Mexico City, looking for work in one of Mexico's premier wrestling promotions, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. He met with Paco Alonso and Antonio Peña, who took him as a joke because of his unique look (he had long dreadlocked blue hair and several tattoos). They decided to throw him in the ring as Vampiro Canadiense (Canadian Vampire) because he told them he liked vampires. To their surprise, with his very limited moveset that only consisted of punches, kicks, and headbutts, he became an overnight sensation, as his rock star appearance and natural good looks caught on with the young Mexican women in the audience.\n\nIn 1992, Vampiro would be part of multiple hair vs hair matches. The first of which would be on March 21 defeating Bestia Negra II. Throughout the months Vampiro would beat Rick Patterson, Pirata Morgan, Aaron Grundy and Sangre Chicana in hair vs hair matches. In late 1992, Vampiro participated in the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship tournament and reached the semi-final before being defeated by Black Magic. In early 1993, Vampiro would team up with Pierroth Jr. to take part in the CMLL World Tag Team Championship tournament and progressed to the final where the two would take on Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Canek in a best two out of three falls match. Going into the last match between the two teams where drawing with one win each, Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Canek would win the last match and therefore the vacant CMLL World Tag Team Championship. In the first round of the Gran Prix 1994 he lost to Yamato in the first round. In mid to late 1994, Vampiro would begin to team up with Pegasus Kid, in the final of the Trios Tournament along with El Rayo de Jalisco Jr. the pair would lose to El Dandy, El Texano and Silver King. Vampiro and Pegasus Kid would lose to El Texano and Silver King in the quarterfinals of the CMLL World Tag Team Championship number one contendership tournament. Vampiro would go on to team up with Apolo Dantés and lost to Dr. Wagner Jr. & Pierroth Jr. in the semi-final of the CMLL World Tag Team Championship number two contendership tournament. In July 1995, Vampiro reached the final of the Gran Prix 1995 before losing to Headhunter A. In what was perhaps the biggest matches of his career to this point, he took on Apolo Dantes in a best out of three falls match for the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. In 1996, Vampiro would leave CMLL to join other top Mexican promotions such as International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) and \"Promo Azteca\" (AZTECAS). However, in 1998 he would return to CMLL, he would take part in the CMLL World Trios Championship tournament and Gran Prix 1998 and would lose both. His last match for CMLL for many years would take place on December 11, 1998.\n\nWhile working in Mexico, Vampiro began a real-life feud with fellow CMLL headliner Konnan. Konnan had been the top star in the promotion prior to Vampiro's arrival and did not take well to his superstardom. The feud stems from Vampiro being offered a part in a Mexican soap opera, but then the producers changing their mind at the last minute when they learned that his command of the Spanish language was poor, and went with Konnan, a fluent Spanish speaker, instead. Vampiro considered that Konnan had sabotaged his chance to parlay his ring success into mainstream stardom, as Konnan did become a mainstream star in Mexico as a result of the role. The rivalry lasted for several years until the two resolved their differences whilst working in WCW, where they became business associates.\n\nOn October 19, 1991, Vampiro would team up with Villano III to defeat Dos Caras and El Canek in a CMLL and UWA joint promotion event. In 1991 he would continue to take part in CMLL and UWA joint promotion events and in 1992 he debuted for Universal Wrestling Association in a single promotion setting. On January 31, 1993, Vampiro defeated El Canek in a two out of three falls match to become the UWA World Heavyweight Champion. He would defend his Championship over the course of 1993 in both single promotion and joint promotion events. He would lose the championship to El Canek on December 19, 1993, holding the championship for almost a year, this would also be his last match for UWA.\n\nOn October 3, 1993, Vampiro would debut for Wrestle Association R defeating Top Gun. In June 1994, Vampiro would start on a two-month tour of Japan where he won almost all his matches and also took part in a tag team tournament where he teamed up with Lionheart and The Warlord and would be knocked out in the first round. On his second tour of Japan, between the months September and October, Vampiro would once again win the majority of his matches. He would also team up with Bob Backlund and Dos Caras to take on Hiromichi Fuyuki, Gedo and Jado for the WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, which Vampiro's team lost. Vampiro would also sporadically take part in WAR events and his last match came on December 4.\n\nIn 1998, after spending nearly his entire career to that point in Mexico, Vampiro was signed by WCW. His first match was on the June 29, 1998, episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", defeating Brad Armstrong. He would not return to WCW until the March 18, 1999 episode of \"WCW Thunder\", when he defeated Prince Iaukea.\n\nLater that year, he formed a stable with the Insane Clown Posse (ICP) and Raven called 'The Dead Pool' (initially called 'The Necro-Ward'). Even though the stable was short-lived, they gained popularity and had a heated feud with Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio Jr., and rival Konnan.\n\nVampiro then feuded with Berlyn. The feud began when Vampiro beat Berlyn in the WCW World Title tournament on Nitro. To exact revenge later in the night, Berlyn cost Vampiro his match against Buff Bagwell and, as a result, Vampiro was eliminated from the tournament. This feud led to the 1999 Mayhem event, where the two fought in a Dog Collar match and Vampiro made Berlyn submit to the Camel Clutch.\n\nVampiro later brought The Misfits into WCW, and began a feud with Oklahoma and \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams. Vampiro and Dr. Death then faced off at Starrcade, with the stipulation that if Vampiro won, he would get five minutes in the ring against Oklahoma. After Williams was disqualified, Vampiro had his match with Oklahoma. Surprisingly, Oklahoma was able to mount a bit of offense, until Vampiro took Oklahoma's cowboy hat and then pinned him following the Nail In The Coffin.\n\nIn early 2000, he formed an alliance with Sting, as the \"Brothers in Paint,\" after he helped Sting to defeat Lex Luger in a lumberjack match. This did not last long, with Vampiro turning on Sting when he pulled Sting underneath the ring at Spring Stampede 2000. They feuded throughout the spring, with Sting getting the upper hand on Vampiro in nearly all their encounters. This set up the Human Torch match, in which Vampiro won by setting Sting on fire. Vampiro then focused on The Demon due to his defection from the ICP formed stable, \"The Dark Carnival.\" He kidnapped his fiancée, Asya, in a skit resembling the 1988 film \"Spoorloos\". Afterward, he challenged him to a Graveyard Match, which sparked the return of Sting.\n\nVampiro entered the vacant WCW United States Title tournament, with his first-round opponent being The Great Muta, who Vampiro lost to. Vampiro later joined up with Muta to attack Ernest 'The Cat' Miller. Vampiro won his first and only title in WCW with The Great Muta, by defeating KroniK in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on August 13, 2000. This reign was very short lived, however, as they lost the Tag Team Championship the very next night to Rey Mysterio Jr. and Juventud Guerrera in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. Vampiro later turned his back on Muta, setting up a 3 Way match at Fall Brawl with himself, Sting and Muta, which was won by Sting. Vampiro then took time away from the sport as his wife had a baby.\n\nHe returned a month later, where he defeated Crowbar in a Hardcore Match. Vampiro then challenged Mike Awesome at Halloween Havoc, losing via pinfall after a top rope Awesome Bomb. He was put out with an injury and did not recover before WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation. Thus, his final WCW appearance was on the November 1, 2000, episode of \"WCW Thunder\" when he teamed up with Jeff Jarrett to take on Sting and Mike Awesome, which led to a loss for Jarrett and Vampiro after Awesome performed a running powerbomb on Vampiro and pinned him.\n\nHodgkinson has claimed that he was hospitalized during the purchase of World Championship Wrestling by Vince McMahon. Hodgkinson was informed that WWF creative team had no plans for him and would not pick up his contract post-merger. He had also claimed that he planned on leaving WCW before he broke his neck.\n\nWith WCW out of business Vampiro headed back to CMLL and returned to action in June, 2001. In 2002, Vampiro would appear on several Pay-per-views and mostly teamed up with top CMLL name Shocker. On September 13, at CMLL 69. Aniversario, Vampiro and Shocker took on Los Guerreros del Infierno for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and lost. Vampiro's last match for CMLL for two years came on April 3, 2005, where Shocker would defeat him. In 2007, Vampiro would return to CMLL for a second time where he competed for only a few months.\n\nIn 2002 Vampiro Toured in Puerto Rico for Puerto Rican Promotion World Wrestling Council (WWC) Where he won the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship once.\n\nOn August 26, 2001, he would start his first tour of All Japan Pro Wrestling lasting only a month where he would participate in mostly opening card matches and very few TV tapings. Vampiro would return in October, 2006 to participate in World's Strongest Tag Determination League 2001 and would team up with George Hines, the team would only win one match and draw another leaving them with three points and not enough to win progress to the semi final. Vampiro would go on two more tours of AJPW one in September 2006 and the second April 2007. In his last match for the promotion, Vampiro teamed up with The Great Muta to take on Taiyo Kea and Toshiaki Kawada for the World Tag Team Championship and lost.\n\nSeptember 17, 2003, Vampiro made his TNA debut costing Raven a Hair vs Hair\" match against Shane Douglas. On September 19, Vampiro defeated CM Punk in an “Open Challenge” match. Then on October 1, Vampiro teamed with Sinn and Slash to face 3Live Kru (Konnan, Ron Killings, BG James) with the match ending in a DQ. The next week, Vampiro attacked Raven and tried to hang him but Raven was saved by the Gathering. The following week, Vampiro and Slash defeated CM Punk & Julio Dinero. On October 29, Vampiro faced Raven in a “Blood Gallows of Retribution” match where he lost. This was Vampiro's final match with TNA.\n\nHodgkinson had a short stint in the American hardcore promotion Xtreme Pro Wrestling. Hodgkinson had a notably stiff match with Kaos during XPW's Cold Day in Hell.\n\nIn 2005, he jumped from CMLL to their rival promotion AAA with Shocker and various other CMLL talents. While at AAA, both he and Konnan held booking positions. During that time, he stated that he had no plans to return to TNA or work for WWE. He stated in interviews with the UK's \"Power Slam Magazine\" that he had no objection to joining TNA - although he suspected it would not happen due to the presence of Sting on their roster. On April 3, 2005, Vampiro returned to the AAA ring in a six-man tag match. Vampiro would team up with Shocker to help him deal with Abismo Negro and Cibernético after Cibernético attacked Shocker's father. In his two years with AAA, Vampiro would mainly appear on TV show tapings and rarely competed at house shows.\n\nIn April 2008, Vampiro made his return to AAA by challenging El Mesias to a match at TripleMania XVI. The match took place on June 13, 2008 in Mexico City, Mexico. The two fought each other in a Hardcore match which ended in a draw. Vampiro defeated Konnan at Rey de Reyes (2009) with the help of Marco Corleone. At Triplemania XVII Vampiro represented Team AAA in a match where they defeated Konnan's La Legión Extranjera to regain control over AAA and force Konnan out of the company. On April 17, 2010, Vampiro turned \"rudo\" and aligned himself with El Zorro of \"La Legión Extranjera\". On August 15, 2010, at \"Verano de Escandalo\" Vampiro unsuccessfully challenged Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Mega Championship in a three–way match, which also included Silver King. After not appearing for the promotion again for four months, Hodgkinson gave his notice and quit AAA on December 20, 2010.\n\nIn January 2011, Vampiro was a guest at \"WrestleReunion 5\" in Los Angeles, California.\n\nVampiro returned to AAA on December 16, 2011, at Guerra de Titanes, saving El Mesías from \"La Sociedad\" and pledging his loyalty to the promotion. Vampiro then started feuding with \"La Sociedad\" member Chessman. On October 7 at \"Héroes Inmortales\", Vampiro and Joe Líder defeated Abyss and Chessman to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship. On December 2 at \"Guerra de Titanes\", Vampiro lost his hair to Chessman in a six-way steel cage \"Lucha de Apuestas\", which also included Cibernético, Dr. Wagner Jr., L.A. Park and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. On May 22, 2013, Vampiro and Líder were stripped of the AAA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn May 24, 2015, Vampiro, along with Matt Striker, served as one half of the English language commentators for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide's Lucha Libre World Cup internet pay-per-view.\n\nOn February 17, 2017, Vampiro was named AAA's Director of Talent.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Taya was stripped of her AAA Reina de Reinas Championship for an unknown reason. She later posted a comment on Twitter saying she was \"backstabbed by AAA\" and announced that she was no longer a part of the AAA Roster. At a TV taping, Sexy Star returned and defeated Big Mami, Lady Shani, Faby Apache, Goya Kong and La Hiedra for the title. Taya later stated she had lost all respect for Sexy Star which started a shoot feud between Johnny Mundo (Taya's husband) and Taya and Kevin Kross. With Mundo and Vampiro having heated conversations backstage, Vampiro chose Texano Jr. to face Mundo for AAA Mega Championship, with Mundo coming out victorious. At a Triplemanía XXV press conference, Vampiro announced that Mundo would face El Hijo del Fantasma and Texano in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match for the AAA Latin American, World Cruiserweight and Mega Championships.\n\nOn May 2020, he announced he leave AAA.\n\nOn January 26, 2007, he was featured in a pilot for a new wrestling show produced for MTV called Wrestling Society X. He competed in a 10-man Battle Royal Death match, eventually securing one of two contracts earning him a shot at the inaugural Wrestling Society X Championship against 6-Pac (Sean Waltman). He won the WSX Championship, on the February 6th episode, after sending Waltman into an exploding coffin with a Tombstone piledriver.\n\nVampiro was involved in a what MTV claimed was a controversial angle which led to MTV canceling the fourth WSX show, due to air on Tuesday, February 20. In the (pre-taped) show, he was the recipient of a fireball to the face thrown by Ricky Banderas which resulted in Vampiro's head momentarily catching fire. The footage has since been leaked onto the internet. Later in his debut WSX match, Ricky Banderas defeated Vampiro to claim the WSX Championship.\n\nIn addition to appearing as an on-screen talent, Vampiro held a backstage position as the main booker.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Vampiro officially came out of retirement and returned to Juggalo Championship Wrestling as both a wrestler and a company consultant. He raised hopes of developing talent, taking the company international, and, more specifically, bringing it to Latin America. At \"Monster's Island\", he was placed in a rivalry with giant wrestler Kongo Kong. Raven interfered in the match and attacked Vampiro, resulting in him losing by pinfall. Vampiro lost his rematch with Kong at Juggalo Championship Wrestling's first internet pay-per-view Hatchet Attacks. On August 14, Vampiro took on Corporal Robinson for the JCW Heavyweight Championship at Bloodymania V which Vampiro lost. Vampiro returned August 12, 2012, defeating Colt Cabana at Bloodymania 6. On August 11, 2013, Vampiro made his return at Bloodymania 7 teaming with 2 Tuff Tony defeating The Boogeyman and Kongo Kong.\n\nOn September 5, 2014, it was announced Vampiro signed with \"Lucha Underground\" as the color commentator for the English and Spanish-language airings. He made his in-ring debut for the promotion at the \"Ultima Lucha\" tapings on April 19, 2015, where he was defeated by Pentagón Jr. It was revealed after the match that he is the master of Pentagon Jr. In a podcast interview with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Vampiro revealed that he wasn't supposed to be Pentagon Jr's opponent at Ultima Lucha but after Pentagon Jr's original opponent backed out of the match, Vampiro went up to creative and requested to work the match with Pentagon Jr. and put him over because of how over Pentagon Jr. is with the fans despite being portrayed as a villain.\n\nThe following season Vampiro would mentor Pentagon until Ultima Lucha Dos where Pentagon (now renamed Pentagon Dark) turned on Vampiro saying that \"he was the master now\".\n\nDuring season 3 of Lucha Underground, Vampiro started mentoring Prince Puma.\n\nDuring Ultima Lucha Tres Vampiro turned on brand new champion Prince Puma during his match against Pentagon Dark. Thus costing Puma his belt and his Lucha Underground career, as well as pairing him back up with Pentagon Dark.\n\nHodgkinson grew up in a single parent home with his mother and two younger sisters. Hodgkinson is divorced from Kitsu with a daughter named Dasha, whose godfather is Norman Smiley.\n\nThe documentary film \"\" was produced by Odessa Filmworks and Zed Jamaica and screened in Canada on November 12, 2008.\nHe was involved in a relationship with Mexican actress Stephanie Salas and Mexican/US rock singer and Songwriter Ana Sidel co-star of the movie \"The Dead Sleep Easy\". He has a tattoo on his left arm that reads \"Mexico City\", where he had many of his matches. He is fluent in Spanish.\n\nDuring the height of his wrestling career in Mexico, Hodgkinson starred in an action film entitled \"Guerrero De La Noche\", which was similar to the \"El Santo\" films of the 1960s and 1970s. He has also made a cameo appearance on Vanilla Ice's \"Bi-Polar\" as well as recording an intro to Psychopathic Records Twiztid's \"Maniac Killa\".\n\nIn July 2009 Hodgkinson reportedly had a break-in at his house; he got startled and jumped 15 feet to the ground from his bedroom window, which broke his back. In a letter posted on the JCW website in 2012, Hodgkinson admitted to having a brain tumor and stomach cancer.\n\nHodgkinson has stated his interest in world religions, particularly occult religions such as voodoo and vampirism. Hodgkinson also claims that two spirits from Guatemala are presently following him as the result of an unfinished ritual.\n\nOn July 5, 2017, Hodgkinson revealed via Facebook he has been a victim of identity theft and cyber hacking for 8 years. On April 12, 2019, Hodgkinson was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nVampiro was featured in the video game WCW Backstage Assault, and .\n\nAs of 2011, Hodgkinson makes occasional appearances on the Mexican show \"Extranormal\", which deals with paranormal activities in the world. He made his acting debut in \"La Mujer de Judas\", 2012 telenovela produced by TV Azteca. Hodgkinson also appeared on Fuse's \"ICP Theater\" as a heckler to the Insane Clown Posse.\n\nVampiro made his debut on the album \"FREEKSHOW\" by the band Twiztid on the track \"Maniac Killa\" where he recorded the introduction of the song.<br>\nOn the Insane Clown Posse album \"Forgotten Freshness 3\" the spitball recording for that intro on the Twiztid album was released as one of the gag tracks on the cd. <br>\nIn 2006, Hodgkinson formed the industrial metal band Droch Fhoula. In January 2007 Carpatos Records released the band's debut maxi-single \"Alter Deus\". A year later in June 2008, the band released its first 6-track EP under the same title of the single.\n\n\n"}

Guarnere (April 28, 1923March 8, 2014) was a United States Army soldier who fought in World War II as a non-commissioned officer with Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, in the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division.\n\nGuarnere wrote \"Brothers in Battle, Best of Friends: Two WWII Paratroopers from the Original Band of Brothers Tell Their Story\" with long-time friend Edward \"Babe\" Heffron and journalist Robyn Post in 2007. Guarnere was portrayed in the 2001 HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" by Frank John Hughes.\n\nGuarnere was born in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1923. He was the youngest of 10 children, to Joseph and Augusta Guarnere, who were of Italian origin. He joined the Citizens Military Training Camp (CMTC) program during the Great Depression. Guarnere's mother told the government her son was 17 when he was, in fact, only 15. He spent three summers in the CMTC, which took four years to complete. His plan upon completion of training was to become an officer in the United States Army. Unfortunately, after his third year, the program was canceled due to the war in Europe.\n\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor and six months prior to graduation, Guarnere left South Philadelphia High School and went to work for Baldwin Locomotive Works, making Sherman tanks for the Army. This upset his mother, because none of her other children had graduated from high school. Guarnere switched to the night shift and returned to school, earning his diploma in 1942. Because of his work, he had an exemption from military service.\n\nHowever, on 31 August 1942, Guarnere enlisted in the U.S. Army Airborne and started training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia.\n\nGuarnere was assigned to Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. He made his first combat jump on D-Day as part of the Allied invasion of France.\n\nGuarnere earned the nickname \"Wild Bill\" because of his reckless attitude towards the enemy. He displayed strong hatred for his enemy, since his elder brother, Henry Guarnere, had been killed fighting in the Italian campaign at Monte Cassino.\n\nIn the early hours of 6 June, he joined Lieutenant Richard Winters and a few others trying to secure the small village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and the exit of causeway number 2 leading from the beach. As they headed south, they heard a German platoon coming to bring supplies and took up ambush positions. Winters told the men to wait for his order to fire, but Guarnere, claiming he thought Winters might be hesitant to kill, opened fire immediately with his Thompson SMG, killing most of the unit.\n\nLater that morning, he also joined Winters in assaulting a group of four 105mm Howitzers at Brécourt Manor. Winters declared Guarnere as Second Platoon Sergeant as the 13 men attacked about 50 Germans. The attack was later used as an example of how a squad could attack a vastly larger force in a defensive position.\n\nGuarnere was wounded in mid-October 1944, while Easy Company was securing the line on \"The Island\" on the south side of the Rhine. As the sergeant of Second Platoon, he had to go up and down the line to check on and encourage his men, who were spread out over a distance of about a mile. While driving a motorcycle that he had stolen from a Dutch farmer across an open field, he was shot in the right leg by a sniper. The impact knocked him off the motorcycle, fractured his right tibia, and lodged some shrapnel in his right buttock. He was sent back to England on 17 October.\n\nWhile recovering from injuries, he didn't want to be assigned to another unit, so he put black shoe polish all over his cast, put his pants leg over the cast, and walked out of the hospital in severe pain. He was caught by an officer, court-martialed, demoted to private, and returned to the hospital. He told them he would just go AWOL again to rejoin Easy Company. The hospital kept him a week longer and then transferred him back to his unit.\n\nHe arrived at Mourmelon-le-Grand, just outside Reims, where the 101st was on R and R (rest and recuperation), about 10 December, just before the company was sent to the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium, on December 16. Because the paperwork did not arrive from England about his court-martial and demotion, he was reinstated in his same position.\n\nWhile holding the line, just up the hill southwest of Foy, a massive artillery barrage hit the men in their position. Guarnere lost his right leg in the incoming barrage, while trying to drag his friend Joe Toye (who had also lost his right leg) to safety. This injury ended Guarnere's participation in the war.\n\nGuarnere received the Silver Star for combat during the Brecourt Manor Assault on D-Day, and was later decorated with three Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts, making him one of only two Easy Company members (the other being Lynn Compton) to be awarded the Silver Star throughout the duration of the war while a member of Easy Company.\n\nIn his autobiography, \"Beyond Band of Brothers: Memoirs of Major Richard Winters\", Richard Winters referred to Guarnere as a \"natural killer.\"\n\nGuarnere returned to the United States in March 1945 and took on many odd jobs. He wore an artificial right leg until he was able to secure full disability from the Army, then threw away the limb, using only crutches thereafter and retired. \n\nHe became an active member of many veterans organizations, and presided over many Easy Company reunions.\n\nAfter returning home from Europe, Guarnere married his girlfriend Frances Peca (d. 1997) and had two sons, Eugene and William Jr. Eugene would follow in his father's footsteps and briefly served in Vietnam. At the time of his death, Guarnere had nine grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren.\n\nGuarnere wrote \"Brothers in Battle, Best of Friends: Two WWII Paratroopers from the Original Band of Brothers Tell Their Story\" with his best friend Edward \"Babe\" Heffron and Robyn Post, outlining Easy Company's experiences. The book was published by Berkley Publishing Group, Penguin Books, in 2007. Guarnere also wrote a short piece for \"Silver Eagle: the official biography of Band of Brothers veteran Clancy Lyall\", which was used as the afterword. British publisher Pneuma Springs Publishing released the book in March 2013.\n\nGuarnere and Heffron remained lifelong friends after returning home. Guarnere was Heffron's best man at the latter's wedding in 1954. He was also the godfather to Heffron's daughter Patricia.\n\nGuarnere died of a ruptured aneurysm at Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia on 8 March 2014. He was 90 years old. He is survived by his two sons, nine grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren.\n\nGuarnere was honored by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with a half-staff flag order by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett to celebrate his life and military service.\n\nHe is laid to rest in SS. Peter and Paul Cemetery 1600 S. Sproul Rd, Springfield, PA 19064.\n\nFollowing his death, Wild Bill's granddaughter formed the Wild Bill Guarnere Memorial Fund to continue Bill's tradition of giving back to Veterans. September 19, 2015, the Fund presented an 8' Bronze Statue of Wild Bill Guarnere, by sculptor Chad Fisher, to the Delaware County Veterans Memorial.\n\n"}

{"id": "1848286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848286", "title": "PowerPC 400", "text": "PowerPC 400\n\nThe PowerPC 400 family is a line of 32-bit embedded RISC processor cores based on the PowerPC or Power ISA instruction set architectures. The cores are designed to fit inside specialized applications ranging from system-on-a-chip (SoC) microcontrollers, network appliances, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to set-top boxes, storage devices and supercomputers.\n\nApplied Micro Circuits Corporation (AMCC) bought assets concerning the 400 family cores from IBM in April 2004 for $227 million, and they now market the processors under their own name. IBM continues evolving the cores while supplying design and foundry services around the cores. Several cores are also available for licensing by OEMs from IBM and Synopsys.\n\nIntroduced in 1994, the PowerPC 403 was one of the first PowerPC processors. It was the first one targeted strictly to the embedded market. Compared to the other PowerPC processors of the era (PowerPC 601, PowerPC 603 and PowerPC 604), it was at the very low end, lacking a memory management unit (MMU) or floating point unit (FPU), for instance. The core was offered for custom chips and in pre packaged versions, including versions with MMU, speeds ranging from 20 to 80 MHz.\n\nThe PowerPC 403 is used in, among other appliances, thin clients, set-top boxes, RAID-controllers, network switches and printers. The first TiVo used a 54 MHz PowerPC 403GCX.\n\nAMCC acquired the design of 403 from IBM in 2004, but have chosen not to market it, instead focusing on the 405 and 440 cores.\n\nWhile the 403 was popular, it was also too high performance and too costly for some applications, so in 1996 IBM released a bare bones PowerPC core, called PowerPC 401. It has a single issue, three-stage pipeline, with no MMU or DMA and only 2 KB instruction and 1 KB data L1 caches. The design contained just 85,000 transistors in all and operated at up to 100 MHz, drawing only 0.1 W or less. Applications using the 401 core range from set-top boxes and telecom switches to printers and fax machines.\n\nThe PowerPC 405 was released in 1998 and was designed for price or performance sensitive low-end embedded system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. It has a five-stage pipeline, separate 16 KB instruction and data L1 caches, a CoreConnect bus, an Auxiliary Processing Unit (APU) interface for expandability and supports clock rates exceeding 400 MHz. The 405 core adheres to the current Power ISA v.2.03 using the Book III-E specification. Both AMCC and IBM are developing and marketing processors using 405 cores. IBM and Synopsys also offers a fully synthesizable core. IBM has announced plans to make the specifications of the PowerPC 405 core freely available to the academic and research community.\n\nPowerPC-405-based applications include digital cameras, modems, set-top boxes (IBM's STB04xxx processors), cellphones, GPS-devices, printers, fax machines, network cards, network switches, storage devices and service processors for servers. Up to two 405 cores are used in Xilinx Virtex-II Pro and Virtex-4 FPGAs. In 2004 Hifn bought IBM's PowerNP network processors that uses 405 cores.\n\n\n\nIntroduced in 1999, the PowerPC 440 was the first PowerPC core from IBM to include the \"Book E\" extension to the PowerPC specification. It also included the CoreConnect bus technology designed to be the interface between the parts inside a PowerPC based system-on-a-chip (SoC) device.\n\nIt is a high-performance core with separate 32 KB instruction and data L1 caches, a seven-stage out-of-order dual-issue pipeline, supporting speeds of up to 800 MHz and L2 caches up to 256 KB. The core lacks a floating point unit (FPU) but it has an associated four-stage FPU that can be included using the APU (Auxiliary Processing Unit) interface. The 440 core adheres to the Power ISA v.2.03 using the Book III-E specification.\n\nXilinx currently incorporates one or two cores (depending on the member of the family) into the Virtex-5 FXT FPGA.\n\nBoth AMCC and IBM are developing and marketing stand alone processors using 440 cores. IBM and Synopsys also offers fully synthesized cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe processing core of the Blue Gene/P supercomputer designed and manufactured by IBM. It is very similar to the PowerPC 440 but few details are disclosed.\n\n\nIntroduced in 2006, the 460 cores are similar to the 440 but reach 1.4 GHz, are developed with multi-core applications in mind and have 24 additional digital signal processing (DSP) instructions. The cores are designed to be low-power but high performance and the 464-H90 is expected to draw only 0.53 W at 1 GHz. The 460 core adheres to Power ISA v.2.03 using the Book III-E specification.\n\n\n\nThe 470 embedded and customizable core, adhering to the Power ISA v2.05 Book III-E, was designed by IBM together with LSI and implemented in the PowerPC 476FP in 2009. The 476FP core has 32/32 kB L1 cache, dual integer units and a SIMD capable double precision FPU that handles DSP instructions. Emitting 1.6 W at 1.6 GHz on a 45 nm fabrication process. The 9 stage out of order, 5-issue pipeline handles speeds up to 2 GHz, supports the PLB6 bus, up to 1 MB L2 cache and up to 16 cores in SMP configurations.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1848291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848291", "title": "America Sings", "text": "America Sings\n\nAmerica Sings was an attraction at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, United States, from 1974 to 1988. It featured a cast of audio animatronics animals that entertained the audience by singing songs from various periods in America's musical history, often in a humorous fashion.\n\nAmerica Sings opened on June 29, 1974, replacing the General Electric-sponsored Carousel of Progress attraction, which had moved to the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort in 1973. America Sings used the same Carousel Theater as its predecessor. The building had an outer ring of six theaters, connected by divider walls, that revolved mechanically about every four minutes around the six fixed stages in the center of the building.\n\nUnlike Disneyland's Carousel of Progress, which rotated clockwise, America Sings rotated counter-clockwise. Also, unlike Carousel of Progress, America Sings only used the lower level of the Carousel Theater. The upper level was eventually used to house the SuperSpeed Tunnel in 1977 (which later became the Game Grid of \"Tron\") that the PeopleMover transportation attraction passed through.\nWritten primarily by Marc Davis and Al Bertino, America Sings was comparable to Disneyland's \"Country Bear Jamboree\", in that it featured a singing cast of audio-animatronics animals. The show's Masters of Ceremonies were an American bald eagle named Sam (voiced by Burl Ives) and an owl named Ollie (voiced by Sam Edwards). The image of \"Eagle Sam\" was designed by Disney animator Marc Davis, as were the other characters. \"Eagle Sam\" is completely separate from the Sam the Olympic Eagle character designed a decade later by C. Robert Moore (also a Disney employee) for the 1984 Summer Olympics, or the Muppet Sam the Eagle.\n\nLike the Carousel of Progress, the first and the last scenes of America Sings involved the loading and unloading of guests, while the other four scenes, or \"acts,\" depicted a particular era. However, the identical load and unload theaters each featured a small curtained gazebo with a backdrop showing a park. The curtains would open to reveal Sam and Ollie standing on a two-level podium, with Sam standing on the higher level, introducing or closing the show.\n\nBetween each act, as the theater rotated, the lights blacked out, and the theater illuminated with flashing stars; during the rotations, Sam sang about the next era the audience was about to enter, reprising the chorus of \"Yankee Doodle\".\n\nAlso, at some point in each act, the Weasel would suddenly appear on the scene, spouting the title line, \"Pop, Goes the Weasel!\" for a total of five times. At the very end of the show, he changed the line to, \"Goodbye, Goes the Weasel!\"\n\nThe characters in America Sings were patterned after the characters from the concept art for an animated movie called \"Chanticleer\" that Walt Disney scrapped in the 1960s.\n\nOn July 8, 1974, nine days after the attraction opened, an 18-year-old high school senior and hostess named Deborah Gail Stone, nicknamed Debby, was accidentally crushed to death between two walls of the building between 10:35 p.m. and 10:40 p.m. A narrow channel between a stationary wall and a rotating wall was open and Stone either fell, stepped backwards, or tried to jump from one stage to the other as the rotating wall began to move (it moved every 2 to 4 minutes which was how long each act was). Her death was pronounced at 11:00 p.m., when the carousel was being reset for a new cycle. One of the audience members heard Stone's screams and notified park staff. By the time the audience member and the staff got to her, it was already too late. Stone had died from her injuries. Stone's parents sued Disneyland for the death of their daughter, which resulted in a small settlement.\n\nFollowing Stone's death, the attraction was abruptly closed down, remaining closed while safety lights were installed and the area where the incident occurred cleaned. Later, the walls in the theater were remodeled so that they would break away in case a similar accident happened. The attraction reopened three days after the incident on July 11. Stone is buried in Fairhaven Memorial Park in her hometown of Santa Ana.\n\nAmerica Sings was born out of the company's desire to celebrate America's Bicentennial. It didn't quite fit the theme of the land, but its relevance to that period in America made it appropriate. However, once the Bicentennial was over, the attraction became more misplaced, in a land dedicated to all things futuristic. Disney's Imagineering team began dreaming up new ideas for Tomorrowland, that included a new show in the carousel theater more fitting for the land of the future. Separately, in the summer of 1983, the idea for a log flume attraction that would become Splash Mountain was conceived by Imagineer and Disney Legend Tony Baxter. Knowing America Sings was eventually to close for a more appropriately themed show, the idea developed to give most of America Sings' audio animatronic figures a new home in Splash Mountain.\n\nIn 1986, roughly two years before America Sings' impending closure, two audio-animatronic geese were taken out of the attraction. Their \"skin\" was removed, leaving only the robotic skeletons. Their heads were then replaced, and they were used as two talkative G2 droids in the queue to \"Star Tours\", which would open in early 1987. One of them (named G2-9T) still sings a modified \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" (retitled \"I've Been Looking at the Same Bag\") in \"\". As a result, the geese quartets in Acts 1 and 2 became trios until America Sings closed for good.\n\nShow sponsor Del Monte having already ended its sponsorship, America Sings officially closed on Sunday, April 10, 1988. Within days, crews began to move most of the Audio-Animatronic animals to Splash Mountain, which opened in the summer of 1989. The rock and roll stork in the finale is now used by Imagineers for training new Animatronics programmers, acting as a final exam of sorts. The remainder of the show's Audio-Animatronics were recycled.\n\nThe Carousel Theater was used as office space for ten years. During this time, the carousel theater's external appearance was unchanged, and the upper level continued to house the Tron tunnel for the PeopleMover until that attraction ceased to operate in 1995. A large sign in front of the building showed Sorcerer Mickey alongside text reading, \"Sorry, we're closed to imagineer a brand new attraction.\" This gave guests some hope that a new attraction was in the works, but the building was not touched for nearly a decade. For many years guests wondered what the new attraction replacing America Sings was going to be. For a few years, during the planned \"Disney Decade\" started by Michael Eisner, a new audio-animatronic show called \"Plectu's Fantastic Intergalactic Revue\" was to open. It was to have been an outer space-themed musical-variety revue featuring a troupe of Audio-Animatronics itinerant alien musicians whose spaceship had landed in Tomorrowland. The idea was part of the original \"Tomorrowland 2055\" plan and was planned to open around 1994. However, Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, ended up costing the Disney company billions of dollars putting them in debt, so the whole \"Tomorrowland 2055\" plan was scrapped due to budget considerations.\n\nFrom its closure until 1996, the inside of the lower level of the Carousel Theater was used for storage and office space leaving only remnants of deteriorating sets and backdrops as well as the empty, unused theater seats. America Sings was finally replaced by Innoventions, a version of the Epcot attraction of the same name, in 1998 as part of the Tomorrowland update of that year. The building was then redesigned and reopened in 2015 as the \"Tomorrowland Expo Center\", hosting the Star Wars Launch Bay.\n\n\nNorman \"Buddy\" Baker arranged a selection of songs chosen to represent a panoramic view of American music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1848292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848292", "title": "William Trenwith", "text": "William Trenwith\n\nWilliam Arthur Trenwith (15 July 1846 – 26 July 1925) was a pioneer trade union official and labour movement politician for Victoria, Australia.\n\nBorn to convict parents at Launceston, Tasmania, he followed his father's trade as a bootmaker. Largely unschooled, barely literate, and with poor eyesight, Trenwith had a gift for oratory and public speaking which was to assist him in union organising and later as a politician. He was involved during the late 1870s with the National Reform League where he agitated for protective tariffs, a land tax, and reform of the Victorian Legislative Council.\n\nAs one of the founding members of the \"Victorian Operative Bootmakers Union\" in 1879 he served as its Secretary in 1883. He was instrumental in coordinating the 1884 bootmakers' strike from Melbourne Trades Hall, which saw Victoria's first fullscale picketing and was an important campaign in the fight against sweated labour. He advocated the abolition of outwork in the bootmaking industry to eliminate cheap labour and encourage unionisation.\n\nTrenwith honed his public oratory skills at North Wharf on the banks of the Yarra River, in Melbourne on Sunday afternoons, along with Joseph Symes, Chummy Fleming, and Monty Miller and many other Australian labour movement activists and radicals of the time.\n\nIn 1886, he was elected President of the Trades Hall Council, and was also made a Life Governor of the Homeopathic Hospital that year. By 1890 he was seen as a Trades Hall bureaucrat being opposed by radicals such as Chummy Fleming about working conditions, who accused Trenwith and other moderate THC bureaucrats, of 'working with blood-sucking capitalists.\n\nAfter a number of attempts at nomination, Trenwith was elected in May 1889 for the seat of Richmond (1889–1903) to the Victorian Legislative Assembly on a labour platform and sought reforms in education, unemployment and tariff protection. He was the lone labour representative in the Victorian Parliament until the following election in April 1892 when 13 labour aligned candidates were elected.\n\nDuring 1892 Trenwith was elected leader of the Victorian Labour Party, but continued to have problems at the grassroots with strong opposition from public meetings chaired by Chummy Fleming. During the 1892 maritime strike he argued strongly for compulsory arbitration over direct action, much to the disgust of labour radicals. In 1893 Trenwith opposed Chummy Fleming's proposal for the affiliation of the Knights of Labor to the Trades Hall Council on the grounds that as a secret organisation it could not be organised industrially.\n\nIn the Parliament of Victoria Trenwith served as Minister for Railways, commissioner for Public Works and vice-president of the Board of Land and Works between November 1900 and February 1901 in the Sir Alexander Peacock ministry, and briefly as Chief Secretary (1901–02). The Government he was part of came under attack in November 1902 from a Trades Hall motion from Chummy Fleming protesting against the reduction of old age pensions from 10/- to 8/-.\n\nTrenwith was the only elected labour representative at the Federal Constitutional Convention (1897–98) that led to the Federation of the six Australian colonies in 1901. His support of Federation was over the objections of many in the labour movement, and served to ameliorate accusations that the Federation Bill had been \"wholly shaped in a conservative direction\" as accused by the Age.\n\nFrom 1903 to 1910 Trenwith served as an Independent Senator for Victoria. His withdrawal of support for the Federal Labor government of Andrew Fisher resulted in his defeat at the following election and retirement from federal politics.\n\nHe attempted to return to Victorian state politics at the 1911 Victorian state election, contesting the seat of Gippsland North against the sitting Labor MLA James McLachlan, but failed to defeat him.\n\n"}

{"id": "1848297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848297", "title": "16 Air Assault Brigade", "text": "16 Air Assault Brigade\n\n16 Air Assault Brigade (16 Air Asslt Bde) is a formation of the British Army based in Colchester in the county of Essex. It is the Army's rapid response airborne formation and is the only brigade in the British Army focused on delivering air assault operations.\n\nAll personnel in the brigade wear the maroon beret, and those qualified as military parachutists wear the appropriate Parachutist Badge.\n\nThe brigade was formed as part of the defence reforms implemented by the Strategic Defence Review on 1 September 1999, by the merging of 24 Airmobile Brigade and elements of 5th Airborne Brigade. This grouping created a highly mobile brigade of parachute units and airmobile units, which employ helicopters.\n\nAfter a ceasefire was declared in North Macedonia between government forces and rebels known as the National Liberation Army, NATO launched a British-led effort, Operation Essential Harvest, to collect weapons voluntarily given up by the rebels. The brigade HQ and some of its elements deployed in August 2001, acting as the spearhead for the NATO operation. It returned home after the NATO mission was successfully completed in September.\n\nAfter the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, NATO established a peacekeeping force in December known as the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), based in the capital Kabul. The brigade HQ and some of its units deployed to Afghanistan in 2001, 2006, 2008 and again in 2010–11, 16th Air Assault Brigade has deployed to Afghanistan more than any other formation to date.\n\nDuring the build-up to the invasion of Iraq, the brigade, commanded by Brigadier Jacko Page, was deployed to Kuwait in February 2003. The brigade was part of 1 (UK) Armoured Division and after extensive training in Kuwait it took part in the beginning of the invasion on 20 March. Initial speculation in the British media suggested that the brigade would support the American 82nd and 101st divisions in an airborne assault on the Saddam International Airport in Baghdad. This plan did not, however, come to fruition. The brigade's eventual objective was to secure the southern oil fields before they were destroyed by Saddam Hussein's forces. The brigade's 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery entered Iraq on 20 March to support U.S. Marine Corps forces in their efforts to capture the Rumaila oil fields, nearly all of the oil wells being taken intact. The rest of the brigade, supported by its AAC helicopters, entered Iraq soon afterwards, still tasked with securing Rumaila. The brigade often met sporadic resistance and had to deal with disarming the many explosives attached to the infrastructure.\n\nThe brigade was subsequently used to guard the oil fields and protect Allied supply lines with elements moving further north of Basra – Iraq's second largest city – to provide a screen protecting it from Iraqi attack. On 31 March, the brigade, assisted by artillery and air support, attacked an Iraqi armoured column advancing on Basra, destroying 17 T-55 tanks, 5 artillery pieces and 7 armoured personnel carriers. After British forces entered Basra on 6 April 3 PARA was employed to clear the 'old quarter' of the city on 7 April due to the narrow streets making it inaccessible to vehicles.\n\nAfter Basra's capture, the brigade was based in Maysan Province, centred around the province's capital Al-Amarah. The brigade carried out patrols into towns, helped bring normality back to the south, tried to maintain order and destroyed any conventional weapons caches that were found. The war was officially declared over on 1 May and the brigade began to return home that same month. During one patrol into Majar al-Kabir on 24 June, the brigade suffered its largest casualties in Iraq when six Royal Military Policemen of 156 Provost Company were killed by a large Iraqi mob.\n\nAs the British Army's rapid response formation, 16 Air Assault Brigade has served in the vanguard of all of the Army's recent operational deployments to Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and is the largest brigade in the Army, with 6,200 personnel. It comprises:\n\nThe brigade HQ is based in Colchester Garrison and was under the operational command of the tri-service Joint Helicopter Command (JHC). For administrative purposes, it was under the control of 5th Division, now Support Command. As of September 2015, Commander Land Forces will assume operational control of the brigade.\n\nFrom November 2016, 16 Brigade reports directly to Commander Field Army whilst the Army Air Corps units previously assigned to the brigade will remain under Joint Helicopter Command.\n\nThe Brigade Headquarters has personnel from both the British Army and the Royal Air Force assigned, enabling it to carry out air and land operations.\n\nDue to the brigade's mobile role, it is lightly armed and equipped. The brigade's land equipment includes Scimitars, WMIK Land Rovers, Supacats, towed L118 105 mm light guns, Javelin anti-tank and lightweight Starstreak air-defence missile launchers. The aviation element of the brigade consists of three attack regiments equipped with WAH-64 Apache and Lynx helicopters from the Army Air Corps, Chinook and Puma support helicopters from the RAF, and Merlin support helicopters from the Fleet Air Arm (all of which are controlled by Joint Helicopter Command). Furthermore, two four-man Tactical Air Control Parties (TACPs) manned by the RAF Regiment provide airspace deconfliction, integration of air platforms within the battlespace, and terminal control of air assets.\n\nIn 1984, 5th Airborne Brigade was in the process of developing its Limited Parachute Assault Capability (LPAC). This required a formation of 15 Hercules aircraft to drop a parachute battalion group over two drop zones (DZs) in under five minutes, by day or night. To do this, there was a requirement for the DZs to be clearly marked, to ensure that the crews had an easily identified reference point to allow them to drop accurately and consistently. With the demise of the 16th Parachute Brigade in 1977, the disbandment of No 1 (Guards) Independent Company meant that the expertise had been lost. Regimental Headquarters was asked to look at the options for providing this capability. Major Phil Neame produced a paper in October 1984 recommending the formation of an independent platoon, with manpower drawn from all three battalions and coming directly under the command of the Brigade Headquarters. It would number a total of 28 in 7 patrols of 4 men and include 2 Royal Signals operators.\n\nToday, the Pathfinder Group is made up of selected personnel from the armed forces, who have undergone a rigorous selection and training programme. The Group is formed around a platoon to company strength cadre of reconnaissance and communications specialists. Its roles include locating and marking parachute drop zones and tactical and helicopter landing zones for air landing operations. Once the main force has landed, the group provides tactical intelligence to assist operational decision-making within the brigade headquarters. The pathfinders can utilise various airborne insertion techniques, which range from the current in-service Low Level Parachute (LLP), to High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) systems.\n\nThe numeral 16 is derived from the 1st Airborne Division and 6th Airborne Division of the Second World War, first used by the 16th Parachute Brigade formed in 1948.\n\nThe brigade's original emblem was a light-blue and maroon shield with a light blue Striking Eagle outlined in maroon emblazoned upon it, and was adopted from the Special Training Centre in Lochailort, Scotland, where Special Forces and Airborne troops were trained between 1943 and 1945. The sign was worn on the left arm. The colours chosen were traditional and showed the make-up of the brigade, maroon for Airborne and light-blue for Army Air Corps.\n\nThe symbol of 5 Airborne Brigade had been Bellerophon on top of Pegasus (a winged horse of Greek mythology) and became synonymous with British airborne forces during World War II. When 16 Air Assault Brigade was formed there was some controversy when the Parachute units of 5 Airborne had to give up the Pegasus symbol and replace it with the Striking Eagle symbol.\n\nHowever, following Army 2020 restructuring, command of 16 Air Assault Brigade was transferred from Joint Helicopter Command to Commander Field Army, and the Pegasus emblem returned as the symbol of British airborne forces on 25 November 2015.\n\nCommanders have included:\n\n\n\n\"Note\": 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment now operates within the Special Forces Support Group.\n\n\n"}

The plan was never carried out. In June 2004, he was sentenced to nine years in prison effective from 18 November 2002, when he was arrested. A non-parole period of 4½ years was fixed, and as such he was released on 17 May 2007. He had faced a maximum sentence of 25 years.\n\nHe was born Paul George Holland in 1953, in the English city of Hull. He then moved to Australia in 1978. In 1992, he converted to Islam.\n\nIn October 1993 he then travelled to Indonesia to learn more about Islam, where he met his third, and current, wife. Upon his return to Sydney, Australia in November 1995 he began to associate with Australia's Jemaah Islamiyah members. In late 1996 he met the then Amir (Abdullah Sungkar) of the Jemaah Islamiyah group in Sydney and swore allegiance to him as a member of the group.\n\nIn 2000, Roche travelled to Afghanistan, where he met with al-Qaeda leaders, such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and ultimately Osama bin Laden. After that, he received basic training in bomb making ( a very basic 10-day course). He was then instructed to organize the set up of a terror cell in Australia which was to target Israeli interests in the country, including the plot to bomb the Israeli embassy. Roche admits to having taken part in the plot, but said he did not plan to carry it out. He admitted to carrying out surveillance on Australian targets, but was unsuccessful in bringing in new recruits for the cell. \nOn 12 June 2000, Roche used a video camera that he had borrowed from Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad to film the Israeli embassy in Canberra, Australia.\n\nIn July 2000 Roche contacted ASIO via telephone 3 times in order to alert authorities as to dangerous elements evolving within Islamic communities in Australia. He had vital information regarding the locations of top Al Qaeda operatives including Khalid Shaikh Muhammd and Osama bin Ladin amongst others (in fact 6 of the FBI's top most wanted at the time). Roche maintains that had the necessary authorities taken the time to listen to his story, the events of 11 September 2001 and the Bali bombings in October 2002 could have been prevented. According to Roche, Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, whom Roche named as the head of Jemaah Islamiyah, eventually called him in August 2000 and ordered him to cancel the plan, having initially given Roche the go ahead to 'do what Hambali had instructed him to do'. Ba'asyir, who is in custody in Indonesia, and who is thought to be linked to terrorist organizations, denies the connection with Jemaah Islamiyah.\n\nSince he was released on 17 May 2007, he lives in South Perth.\n\n\n"}

He was played by Josh \"J. Elvis\" Weinstein.\n\nDr. Erhardt is a mad scientist and was Dr. Clayton Forrester's first assistant. He is a very different character from Forrester's later assistant, TV's Frank. He is more high-spirited than Frank, speaks with a high, squeaky voice, has curly black hair, and thick glasses. Erhardt is himself a \"mad scientist\" like Forrester, whereas Frank is neither a scientist nor, for the most part, mad. Just like Frank, however, Erhardt goes through many tortures by Dr. Forrester. His catchphrase was, after soberly describing a horrible movie's plot or some other dire scenario, to proclaim cheerily, \"Enjoy!\"\n\nLittle is known of Erhardt's past save that he became a \"mad scientist\" while working at a zoo; he went mad when, in his own words: \"...they promised me students, but all I got were monkeys! Monkeys! Monkeys! So I took off my wetsuit, dropped that hedge clipper, and walked out of that zoo forever!\" Any additional details are left for the viewers to fill in themselves since MST3K was, after all, \"just a show\", and the viewers should \"really just relax\".\n\nEventually finding employment at Gizmonic Institute, he became Dr. Forrester's assistant and worked with him to launch Joel Robinson into space, where the pair conducted their movie-watching experiments on him.\n\nDr. Erhardt was only on the show for the KTMA season and the nationally telecast Season 1. When Frank was first introduced on the show and Joel asked what happened to Dr. Erhardt, Frank simply held up a milk carton with Erhardt's picture on it saying, \"He's missing\". Because Best Brains, the production company behind MST3K, discouraged the replaying of Season 1 episodes and had no rights to the KTMA episodes, few fans had actually had a chance to see him and therefore Erhardt fell into obscurity. After the milk carton reference, he was mentioned only once more, in episode #313 - \"Earth vs. the Spider\" featuring a scene where a policeman closely resembling Erhardt is eaten by a giant spider, and Joel and the bots speculated that this was the true fate of Erhardt.\n\nDr. Erhardt returned in episode #1204 - \"The Day Time Ended\", and is now depicted as a suave space hero changed by thirty years of interstellar travel. He returns to retrieve the ashes of Dr. Forrester (and, incidentally, TV's Frank) from the Gizmonic Institute.\n\nDr. Forrester and Dr. Erhardt were first shown in episode K07, during the show's original season on KTMA TV23. During this season, and season 1, J. Elvis Weinstein (who was credited under his real name Josh Weinstein) held a dual role as both Dr. Erhardt and the voice of Tom Servo, and he also provided the voice of Gypsy during the KTMA years (replaced in season one by Jim Mallon). Weinstein, the youngest of the MST3K creators, left the show after its first nationally telecast season due to creative differences once the show began being scripted instead of being ad-libbed. His youth and relative inexperience was also said to have rubbed his older co-workers the wrong way. In an interview, he stated the show simply quit being fun for him when they moved from KTMA to The Comedy Channel because it became \"a business\". Weinstein elaborated on this unpleasant workplace dynamic in an April 2019 episode of Bill Corbett’s Funhouse podcast, wherein he claimed that producer Jim Mallon was openly hostile toward him and insisted on his being paid significantly less than other cast members, presumably because of his age and refusal to maintain a level of “faux humility” displayed by some of his cohorts.\n"}

Welch was born in Hertford, North Carolina, attended the University of North Carolina, and then founded his Cambridge candy company in 1927. His partner in the company was his brother, Robert W. Welch, Jr., who retired from the confectionery business in 1956 and two years later founded the John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1963, the brand was acquired by Nabisco, who sold the brand to Warner-Lambert Company (now part of Pfizer) in 1988, who in turn sold the brand to Tootsie Roll in 1993. Today, Junior Mints are still manufactured in the Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge at a factory of Cambridge Brands, a Tootsie Roll Industries subsidiary. The same factory makes all Sugar Babies and Charleston Chews.\n\nThe name of the product is a pun on Sally Benson's \"Junior Miss\", a collection of her stories from \"The New Yorker\", which were adapted by Jerome Chodorov and Joseph Fields into a successful play. The play was directed by Moss Hart and ran on Broadway from 1941 to 1943. According to one past official company history, when James Welch developed and launched the product in 1949, he named the candy after his favorite Broadway show. Yet the candy came six years after the play had closed on Broadway. Current copy on the Junior Mints box incorrectly gives the date of the Broadway play as 1949. Some may argue that this is comparable to the \"potato potato\" scenario, as depending on how you read \"named after a top Broadway play in 1949: \"Junior Miss\"\", it may be interpreted that it is simply referring to the candy being named in 1949.\n\nIn 1945, the play was adapted to film, with George Seaton directing Peggy Ann Garner in the lead role. The \"Junior Miss\" radio series, starring Barbara Whiting, was being broadcast weekly on CBS at the time Junior Mints were first marketed in 1949. Thus, Welch had cleverly created a product sold at movie theater concession stands and identified with a specific movie and radio series and displaying a name that sounded almost exactly like that property–yet different enough that it avoided any fees for licensing and merchandising. Junior Mints quickly became a popular candy at movie concession stands, and one product in the line is the three oz. box marketed as the \"Theater Size Junior Mints Concession Candy\".\n\nOver 15 million Junior Mints are produced daily. Tootsie Roll also makes Junior Caramels (caramel filling with a milk chocolate coating) and limited edition \"Inside Outs\" (mint-chocolate filling with a white chocolate shell). Other limited edition Junior Mints include Valentine's Day Pastels/Valentine's Day Regulars (not pastel), Easter Pastels, Christmas edition (featuring red and green fillings), and Christmas Peppermint Crunch edition (featuring crunchy peppermint flakes in the outer chocolate coating). Junior Mints are sold in various amounts from the fun-size boxes to the movie theater-size boxes, since the product continues to sell well in movie theaters. Junior Mints have traveled throughout the world. They are now certified kosher dairy by the Orthodox Union.\n\nIn 2009, Tootsie Roll introduced a companion product, \"Junior Mints Deluxe\". The \"Deluxe\" is a larger dark chocolate covered mint that comes foil wrapped (much like a chocolate covered cherry) and is sold in 10, 22, and 72-piece boxes with a fold up sign, designed for individual piece sale on retail counter tops.\n\nJunior Mints were prominently featured in an episode of \"Seinfeld\" titled \"The Junior Mint\". While observing the surgery of Elaine's ex-boyfriend Roy, Kramer offers a Junior Mint to Jerry, who refuses the offer—to which Kramer later states, \"Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint; it's delicious!\"—and the two accidentally drop it into the retracted abdominal cavity below. After Roy's condition deteriorates, Jerry calls the hospital intending to confess the whole situation, only to discover that Roy's condition has improved. The doctor attributes the miraculous recovery to \"something beyond science — something, perhaps, from above.\" In reality, a York Peppermint Pattie was used because Junior Mints were too small to be filmed.\n\nIn \"Fancy Boys\" episode \"The Junior Mints\", Aaron and Barry try to somehow get a lifetime supply of Junior Mints throughout the episode.\n\nYouTuber Justine Ezarik (iJustine) is known as the biggest Junior Mints fan. As a child she owned Junior Mints fanfare such as a lunch box, T- shirts, and a blanket. Now it is still her favorite candy but she is not as enthusiastic about it.\n\nThe 2006 Augusten Burroughs book \"Possible Side Effects\" contains a chapter, \"Mint Threshold\", about the author's experience creating an advertising campaign for Junior Mints.\n\n\n"}

The title is taken from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (\"...the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...\").\n\nThe film was successful at the box office, and Midler was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Actress in a Motion Picture (Leading Role).\n\nRefined but struggling actress Lauren Ames (Shelley Long) finally has a chance to study with the great theatre professor Stanislav Korzenowski (Robert Prosky). Sandy Brozinsky (Bette Midler), a brash, loud actress, decides through happenstance to also study with Korzenowski. Lauren and Sandy take an instant dislike to each other when they first meet in Korzenowski's class, but unknown to each other, both women begin dating the same man, Michael Santers (Peter Coyote).\n\nWhen Michael \"dies\" in a gas explosion at a local store, Lauren and Sandy figure out that Michael may have faked his death, and they form an uneasy alliance to follow leads across the country to find him and force him to choose between them. During their quest, Lauren and Sandy are chased by CIA agents, as well as Russian assassins who are also after Michael.\n\nWhen Lauren and Sandy finally find Michael, he tries to kill both of them and they are forced to run until they are captured by the federal agents. Lauren and Sandy learn that Michael is a double agent for the CIA who has now gone rogue, also working for the KGB, and that he has stolen a toxin that could destroy huge areas of nature with just a few drops. The CIA wants to find Michael to force him to give back the toxin bio-weapon, while the Russian assassins are men cheated by the double agent who works for Korzenowski, their theatre professor.\n\nThe chase leads to rural New Mexico when Lauren is taken hostage by Michael and his rogue associates who force a trade with the CIA for the toxin, and with Korzenowski with the stolen cash he intended to give to Michael. When the trade goes awry, Lauren gets away with both the money and the toxin, with Michael in hot pursuit. Cornered on a series of mountain tops, Lauren uses her former ballet skills to evade him, culminating in a grand jeté, as pursuing Michael slips and is presumably killed on the rocks far below while the money is lost to Native Americans. The women form a lasting friendship, and go on to perform \"Hamlet\" together, with Lauren in the title role and Sandy as Ophelia.\n\n\nBoth Shelley Long and Bette Midler were promised top billing when they signed to do the film; however, neither was willing to give up top billing to the other. To compromise, Long received top billing in advertising west of the Mississippi River, and Midler received the honor in the east. This agreement extended through the original LaserDisc and VHS release of the title, with discs shipped to retailers in the west featuring Shelley Long and retailers on the east receiving discs featuring Bette Midler.\n\nMidler remarked that working with Long was difficult, echoing similar sentiments amongst Long's bosses on her hit TV series \"Cheers\".\n\nSuzanne Somers has said that Michael Eisner offered her a three-movie deal with Disney which included \"Outrageous Fortune\", but she turned it down. She would have played Bette Midler's part.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 50% rating on review aggregator \"Rotten Tomatoes\", based on 22 reviews, indicating a lukewarm response. For her performance, Midler received a Golden Globe nomination.\n\n\"Outrageous Fortune\" was financially successful, debuting at No. 2 domestically, and bringing in $52,864,741 in the US.\n\n"}

He was educated at Shrewsbury and later at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1840, he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB). He migrated to Australia in 1841, and in February 1842 arrived in the Port Phillip District (later Victoria). He was soon admitted to the Victorian bar, and practised as a solicitor in Geelong until 1854, when he took up farming near Winchelsea. In 1840 he married Harriet Amelia Orton. In 1851–52 he played cricket for Victoria.\n\nOn 28 November 1855 Sladen was nominated to the Victorian Legislative Council, and was appointed acting Treasurer. When Victoria gained responsible government in 1856, Sladen was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as Member for Geelong, and became Treasurer in the ministry of William Haines, a position he held until March 1857. He advocated the creation of a public bank and increased immigration. Sladen did not contest the 1859 election and contested but lost the 1861 election for Geelong East.\n\nA firm conservative, Sladen re-entered politics in November 1864 when he was elected to the Legislative Council for Western Province in a by-election. When the liberal Premier James McCulloch resigned in May 1868 during the conflict between the government and the Council over the proposed grant to retiring Governor Charles Darling, Sladen was asked by the new Governor, Sir John Manners-Sutton, to form a government.\n\nSladen found himself in a hopeless situation, since he was a member of the upper house at a time when it was increasingly accepted that the leader of the government must come from the Assembly — he is the only member of the Council ever to serve as Premier. Since he had little support in the Assembly, his government had no prospect of long-term survival. Following the resolution of the Darling grant crisis, he stepped down in July, and in September he retired from the Council.\n\nIn September 1876 Sladen was again elected to the Council for Western Province, and became the \"de facto\" leader of the Council in its conflicts with the Assembly. Despite being very conservative, Sladen recommended that the franchise for the Council be extended, and that the property qualifications for membership be reduced. These reforms were enacted in 1881. Sladen retired in 1882 due to poor health and died in 1884 in Geelong.\n\nSladen was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1875. A portrait of him hangs in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne.\n\n"}

{"id": "1848409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848409", "title": "Józef Kasparek", "text": "Józef Kasparek\n\nJózef Kasparek (1915–2002) was a Polish lawyer, historian and political scientist.\n\nUntil World War II he lived in southeastern Poland (in Poland's southern \"Kresy\"), in an area that is now in western Ukraine.\n\nJózef Kasparek was born in 1915 in Broumov (in German, \"Braunau\"), Bohemia, Austro-Hungarian Empire, in what is now the Czech Republic, near that country's border with what was then German Silesia and is now Poland's Lower Silesian Province. Kasparek was the son of Teodor Kasparek (1867–1940) and Emilia, \"née\" Obst von Minnenthal. The father was a lawyer who, before World War I, had been a judge in Austrian-ruled Bosnia and was now, aged nearly fifty, serving as a volunteer in Józef Piłsudski's Polish Legions; in his youth, parting ways with his lawyer-father's conservatism and Germanic-culture orientation, he had co-founded the Polish Socialist Party with Ignacy Daszyński before studying law in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nWhile Teodor Kasparek was serving in Piłsudski's Legions, his son Józef spent his first years at , on the Dniester River, birthplace of one of the 16th-century founders of Polish literature, Mikołaj Rej. Józef later attended the Lwów Corps of Cadets, a state-run military-style secondary school. He also studied piano at his paternal maiden aunts' well-regarded music school in Lwów. Later, as a young man, he participated in stage plays under the tutelage of the celebrated theater director, Leon Schiller. He drew portraits with the skill of an inspired artist. But Józef, whom his mother called a \"\"gawędziarz\"\" (story-teller), seemed to find himself especially as a writer. While a law student at Lwów University, he wrote for the Lwów \"political-opposition\" newspaper, \"Dziennik Polski\" (The Polish Daily), edited by , and compiled a collection of short stories that was about to be published when World War II supervened.\n\nIn late 1938, soon after the Munich Conference, Józef Kasparek, a 23-year-old Lwów University law student and Polish Army artillery reservist, helped initiate and carry out, under Polish General Staff direction, covert operations in Carpathian Rus. The object of \"\" (Operation Crowbar)—Kasparek was unaware of the cryptonym—coordinated with operations by Hungarian paramilitary forces, was to subvert the Nazi-German-aligned regime of Avhustyn Voloshyn and restore that easternmost, smallest region of Czechoslovakia to Hungary. Carpathian Rus was being turned by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists into a Piedmont to aspirations for Ukrainian national independence, which might have been won for the first time since medieval Kievan Rus.\n\nA Ukrainian \"sich\" (military camp) outside the Rusyn capital, Uzhhorod, was, under German tutelage, training Ukrainians from southeastern Poland for prospective action in Poland jointly with Germany. This constituted a clear and present danger to the Polish population just across the Carpathian Mountains in largely Ukrainian-populated southeastern Poland, as Adolf Hitler worked to complete a near-total encirclement of Poland on her north, west and south while Poland's eastern frontier faced a hostile Soviet Union.\n\nHungary had ruled Carpathian Rus from the Middle Ages until defeated in World War I, and had been lobbying Adolf Hitler to sanction Hungary's repossession of Rus. Following the Polish-Hungarian covert operations in Carpathian Rus, under the First Vienna Award in November 1938, Hungary received some largely Hungarian-populated areas of Carpathian Rus.\n\nFurther coordinated Polish-Hungarian partisan operations ultimately led to the restoration, in mid-March 1939, of Hungarian sovereignty over all of Carpathian Rus and the re-establishment of the historic common Polish-Hungarian border.\n\nSix months later, during the invasion of Poland in September 1939, that common border would become of pivotal importance when Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy's grateful government, as a matter of \"Hungarian honor\", declined Hitler's request to transit German forces across Rus into southeastern Poland to speed Poland's conquest. This in turn allowed the Polish government and tens of thousands of Polish military personnel to escape into neighboring Romania and Hungary, and from there to France and French-mandated Syria to carry on operations as the third-strongest Allied belligerent after Britain and France.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War II, for his part in the Carpathian operation, Kasparek received the Cross of Valor (\"Krzyż Walecznych\"). After the war, in Britain, General Bolesław Bronisław Duch heard of the operation from other participants and nominated Kasparek for Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari. At the session of the \"kapituła\" (chapter), however, the nomination was blocked by General Władysław Anders after Duch adamantly opposed Anders' own nomination of his paymaster for the Virtuti Militari.\n\nKasparek fought in defense of Poland during the country's invasion in September 1939. A particular turning point in the September Campaign for Kasparek, which likely saved his life, occurred when he was sent to Żółkiew for maps and, at 16th-century Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski's castle, met Colonel Stanisław Maczek (who later in the war, in Great Britain, would become commander of the Polish First Armored Division). Maczek transferred Kasparek, who had just been wounded by a German aerial bomb outside the castle, to a newly formed artillery battery, thereby liberating him from his Virtuti-Militari-decorated sadistic captain.\n\nAfter the Soviet Army entered Lwów, the local Polish Army commander, General Władysław Langner, ordered his forces to surrender to the Soviet forces and place themselves in Soviet custody. Kasparek showed the independent streak that he had inherited from his parents and refused to obey the order. He attempted unsuccessfully to convince fellow officers to do likewise. By refusing what he considered a disastrous order on Langner's part, Kasparek avoided becoming, like the officers who obeyed it, a victim of the Katyn massacres. Soon after, he joined the nascent Polish Resistance movement.\n\nDenounced to the Soviet authorities, arrested, and interrogated for six months by the Soviet NKVD, Kasparek was sentenced to eight years in Soviet \"Gulag\" forced labor camps, called \"łagry\" by the Poles. His pregnant wife had already been deported to Kazakhstan; their first daughter would die there at age two of pertussis. Kasparek himself barely survived two years' hard labor, emaciation and near-fatal typhus before being \"amnestied\" with other Poles by the Soviets after Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union (June 1941).\n\nJoining General Władysław Anders' new Polish army, the Second Corps, being formed in the USSR, Kasparek and his wife, reunited after two years, were evacuated to the Middle East. There Kasparek served as adjutant to General Leopold Okulicki. From the Middle East, rather than going on to Italy with most of the Second Corps, Kasparek and his wife transferred into the Polish Air Force in Great Britain. After the war, he was a contract military officer, serving as adjutant to General Bolesław Bronisław Duch, until 1948, when Polish military units were disbanded.\n\nIn December 1951 Kasparek moved his family to the United States, where he would live out the next fifty years. In the United States, resuming an interest in comparative constitutional systems that Kasparek had begun in law school, he wrote a doctoral thesis that became the book, \"The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States\". The book compares, and traces mutual influences upon, the constitutions of the United States and Poland, including the world's first modern codified national constitution, the United States Constitution that went into effect in 1789, and the world's second, Poland's Constitution of May 3, 1791.\n\nKasparek had experienced war at first hand. By the 1950s he had concluded that the world's peoples must replace warfare with global procedures to budget the world's resources to meet the world's needs. His view was borne out by subsequent decades, which brought nuclear-weapons limitation treaties and a growing realization that global environmental threats call for global remedies.\n\n\n"}

The force was commonly known as the Zapatistas.\n\nThe Zapatistas were formed in 1910 in the southern Mexican state of Morelos. Zapata, whose main cause was land reform, became one of the major figures of the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThe Zapatistas originally aligned with Francisco Madero in opposition to the regime of president Porfirio Diaz, who was soon after overthrown in 1911. After Madero's regime, too, proved uncommitted to the cause of land reform, the Zapatistas turned against him. Fighting continued against the successive leaders Victoriano Huerta and Venustiano Carranza. In 1914, Zapata met at the head of his army with Pancho Villa and his forces at Mexico City to determine the course of the revolution, but they returned to their respective territories without a connected anti-Constitutionalist coalition. When back in Morelos, the Zapatistas fortified themselves against incursions by the forces eager to reassume control of the liberated territories known as the Morelos Commune. Zapata's assassination in 1919 struck a mortal blow to Zapatistas, and the army slowly disbanded afterwards.\n\nThe Zapatistas were mainly poor peasants who wished to spend much of their time working their land to produce an income. As a result, Zapatista soldiers tended to serve for several months at a time, and then return home to spend most of the year farming.\n\nThe structure of the Zapatista army was very loose and the rank system limited in scope. The Zapatista army was united entirely by the charismatic leadership of Zapata, but run by Abraham Gonzalez, the first commandant of the Mexican Marine Corps. It was divided into small, largely independent units rarely numbering more than one hundred men, each commanded by a chief (\"jefe\"). These units spent the overwhelming majority of their time separated from the other units. Officer ranks were eventually introduced to coordinate groups. The chief of a unit over about fifty men was, generally speaking, given the rank of general. Smaller bands were commanded by colonels and captains. Not all captains were official; that is to say, recognised by Zapata and senior Zapatistas, some being unofficially proclaimed captains by their unit. Beyond Zapata's overall command and the leadership of bands, there was limited use of ranks or hierarchy. Sub-officer ranks were introduced late in the revolution in an effort to create a more disciplined force.\nOne of Zapata's famous dictums was \"\"al ratero perdono pero al traidor jamas\"\"; \"a robber I can forgive, but a traitor... never.\"\n"}

However, for much of its recent history, Batu Ferringhi was a quiet village, until the urbanisation of the area beginning in the 1970s.\n\nDue to its location along the northern coast of Penang Island, Batu Ferringhi was hard hit by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n\nThe word \"ferringhi\" or \"feringgi\" is a modern spelling of the Classical Malay word \"peringgi\", originally used in reference to the Portuguese conquistadors before being all people of European descent. It is cognate with the Thai farang and Khmer barang. All derive from the Indian word \"firangī\" (फ़िरंगी) which itself originates either with the Arabic \"ferringi\" or Persian \"farangi\". In the Middle East and Africa, it originally referred to the Franks but came to mean Europeans in general. \n\nBatu Ferringhi, therefore, would mean the place where Westerners had come ashore, with the Malay word \"batu\" (meaning rock) referring to the rocky shoreline of this particular area.\n\nAmong Tamils, the area is known as \"Paringgi Malai\" meaning \"foreigner's hill\".\n\nBatu Ferringhi was first explored in 1592, when Sir James Lancaster, an English privateer, came ashore at this particular area. This made Lancaster the first European to reach Penang Island. Having come ashore aboard the \"Edward Bonaventure\", Lancaster and his crew proceeded to pillage every vessel they encountered for the next four months.\n\nThe urbanisation of Batu Ferringhi only began in the 1970s. This involved the construction of several hotels along the beaches, attracting locals and tourists alike. Condominiums soon followed, offering gorgeous views of the sea overlooking the Malay Peninsula. However, these developments did not come without problems, such as the deteriorating seawater quality that has led to the infestation of jellyfish around Batu Ferringhi.\n\nBatu Ferringhi was one of the hardest hit areas during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that ultimately claimed a total of 52 lives in Penang.\n\nIn 2009, Hard Rock Hotel opened its Penang branch at Batu Ferringhi, adding to the list of major hotels already within the suburb.\n\nThe main thoroughfare within Batu Ferringhi is the coastal Batu Ferringhi Road, part of Federal Route 6. Batu Ferringhi Road continues on from Tanjung Bungah Road, cutting through the heart of the suburb until it becomes Jalan Teluk Bahang at the western edge of Batu Ferringhi. The few roads within this suburb, including Batu Ferringhi Road, are prone to traffic congestion due to its popularity as a tourist destination.\n\nRapid Penang buses 101 and 102 serve the residents of the suburb, by connecting Batu Ferringhi with George Town and other destinations on Penang Island, such as Tanjung Bungah, Tanjung Tokong, the Penang International Airport and Queensbay Mall.\n\nAnother bus service, the \"Hop-On Hop-Off\" service, caters primarily to tourists. This service, which utilises open-topped double decker buses, includes three stops within Batu Ferringhi - an optional stop at Miami Beach and two standard stops at Holiday Inn and Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nThe only school within the Batu Ferringhi suburb is the Uplands International School, which caters primarily to the expatriate community within this suburb as well as those from the neighbouring Tanjung Bungah suburb.\n\nThe nearest public primary and high schools are situated at Tanjung Bungah.\n\nAlthough Batu Ferringhi does not have a shopping centre, the suburb is notable for its night market. Souvenirs, DVDs, artworks, jerseys, and other apparels and accessories can be found at bargain prices within the night market, which is also lined with various food stalls that sell Penang's famed street cuisine and titbits.\n\n"}
