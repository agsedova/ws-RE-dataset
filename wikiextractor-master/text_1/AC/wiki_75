It commemorates the landing of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo at San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542. This event marked the first time a European expedition had set foot on what later became the West Coast of the United States. The site was designated as California Historical Landmark #56 in 1932. As with all historical units of the National Park Service, Cabrillo was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\n\nThe annual Cabrillo Festival Open House is held on a Sunday each October. It commemorates Cabrillo with a reenactment of his landing at Ballast Point, in San Diego Bay. Other events are held above at the National Monument and include Kumeyaay, Portuguese, and Mexican singing and dancing, booths with period and regional food, a historical reenactment of a 16th-century encampment, and children's activities.\n\nThe park offers a view of San Diego's harbor and skyline, as well as Coronado and Naval Air Station North Island. On clear days, a wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean, Tijuana, and Mexico's Coronado Islands are also visible. A visitor center screens a film about Cabrillo's voyage and has exhibits about the expedition.\n\nThe Old Point Loma Lighthouse is the highest point in the park and has been a San Diego icon since 1855. The lighthouse was closed in 1891, and a new one opened at a lower elevation, because fog and low clouds often obscured the light at its location 129 meters (422 feet) above sea level. The old lighthouse is now a museum, and visitors may enter it and view some of the living areas.\n\nThe area encompassed by the national monument includes various former military installations, such as coastal artillery batteries, built to protect the harbor of San Diego from enemy warships. Many of these installations can be seen while walking around the area. A former army building hosts an exhibit that tells the story of military history at Point Loma.\n\nThe area near the national monument entrance was used for gliding activities in 1929-1935. Several soaring endurance records were established here by William Hawley Bowlus and others including the first 1-hour flight in a sailplane, and a 15-hour flight in 1930 which surpassed the world record for soaring endurance. Even Charles Lindbergh soared in a Bowlus sailplane along the cliffs of Point Loma in 1930. Markers for these accomplishments can be found near the entrance, and the site is recognized as a National Soaring Landmark by the National Soaring Museum.\n\nOn October 14, 1913, by presidential proclamation, Woodrow Wilson reserved of Fort Rosecrans for \"The Order of Panama ... to construct a heroic statue of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo.\" By 1926 no statue had been placed and the Order of Panama was defunct, so Calvin Coolidge authorized the Native Sons of the Golden West to erect a suitable monument, but they were also unable to carry out the commission.\n\nA major renovation of the half-acre monument was undertaken in 1935; the deteriorating lighthouse was refurbished, a new road to the monument was built, and the Portuguese ambassador to the United States presented a bronze plaque, honoring Cabrillo as a \"distinguished Portuguese navigator in the service of Spain\" who made \"the first Alta California landfall\".\n\nIn 1939 the Portuguese government commissioned a heroic statue of Cabrillo and donated it to the United States. The sandstone statue, executed by sculptor Alvaro de Bree, is tall and weighs . The statue was intended for the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco but arrived too late and was stored in an Oakland, California garage. Then-State Senator Ed Fletcher managed to obtain the statue in 1940 over the objections of Bay Area officials and shipped it to San Diego. It was stored for several years on the grounds of the Naval Training Center San Diego, out of public view, and was finally installed at Cabrillo Monument in 1949. The sandstone statue suffered severe weathering because of its exposed position and was replaced in 1988 by a replica made of limestone.\n\nCabrillo Monument was off-limits to the public during World War II because the entire south end of the Point Loma Peninsula was reserved for military purposes. Following the war the area of the national monument was enlarged significantly by Presidents Eisenhower and Ford. It currently includes more than .\n\nDespite factors such as the toxicity of the San Diego Harbor, over-harvesting of native species, large-scale developments for the 3.1 million residents of the San Diego-Carlsbad Metropolitan Area, and the introduction of exotic and harmful species to the area, there is still a vast array of flora and fauna that inhabit the Monument area.\n\nOne of the most thriving and diverse animal communities of Cabrillo National Monument is located in the intertidal zone and tide pools. The species that live in the tide pools include coralline algae, chitons, true limpets, acorn barnacles (\"Sessilia\"), goose neck barnacles, rock louse, sea lettuce, kelp fly (\"Coelopa frigida\" or seaweed fly), pink thatched barnacles, encrusting algae, periwinkles, mussels (\"Mytilus californianus)\", dead man's fingers (\"Codium fragile\"), sea bubbles, unicorn snail (Acanthina spirata), anemones, \"Tegula\" top snails, sculpin, aggregating anemone, sandcastle worms, hermit crabs, rockweed (\"Silvetia fastigiata\"), wavy turban snails (\"Turbo fluctuosus\"), keyhole limpet (Fissurellidae), brittle star, surfgrass, surfgrass limpet, kelp crab, garibaldi, sea hare, opaleye, bat star, knobby blue star, sea urchin, sargassum weed, feather boa kelp, octopus, chestnut cowry, sea palm, ruddy turnstone, and lined shore crab. The Monument advises that the best time to see the tide pools is in the late fall or winter, when tides are rated at negative one or lower during daylight hours.\n\nIn the winter (December through March), migrating gray whales can be seen off the coast from the Whale Overlook station, 100 yards south of the old lighthouse. Established in 1950, this was the first public whale watching lookout point in the world. During its first year of operation, 10,000 people visited the lookout to observe the gray whale migration.\n\nNative coastal sage scrub habitat along the Bayside Trail offers a place to hike or relax, as well as a noteworthy habitat for wildlife.\n\nThe park's activities are supported by the Cabrillo National Monument Foundation, a private nonprofit organization which helps with educational activities and special projects as well as operating a bookstore at the site. The foundation has also published several books on historic and scientific topics related to the Monument.\n\nThe park's ecosystems have encountered multiple non-native species not originally part of the habitat but rather have been introduced and adapted to it over time. One example of non-native species harming native species is the Argentine ant. These ants have displaced the native ants, and this impacted the coast horned lizard population, which only ate the native ants. In those areas where Argentine ants had established colonies, the coast horned lizard is no longer found.\n\nIn 1851, a year after California entered the Union, the U.S. Coastal Survey selected the heights of Point Loma to be a navigational aid. The crest seemed like the right location: it stood 422 feet above sea level, overlooking the bay and the ocean, and a lighthouse there could serve as both a harbor light and a coastal beacon.\n\nConstruction began on the lighthouse in early 1854 and was completed in November 1855. By late summer 1854, the work was done. More than a year passed before the lighting apparatus - a five-foot-tall 3rd order Fresnel lens, the best available technology - arrived from France and was installed. At dusk on November 15, 1855, the keeper climbed the winding stairs and lit the oil lamp for the first time. In clear weather its light was visible at sea for 25 miles. For the next 36 years, except on foggy nights, it welcomed sailors to San Diego harbor. However, the lighthouse's location on top of a 400-foot cliff meant that fog and low clouds often obscured the light from the view of ships.\n\nOn March 23, 1891, the flame was permanently extinguished and the light was replaced by the New Point Loma lighthouse at a lower elevation. In 1984, the light was lit by the National Park Service for the first time in 93 years to celebrate the site's 130th birthday.\nAfter boarding up the old lighthouse in 1891, the keeper moved his family and belongings into a new light station at the bottom of the hill, which is still an active light. It can be seen from the Whale Overlook, 100 yards south of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, or from the tide pool area.\n\nThe Visitor Center offers a place to purchase souvenirs and learn about the park's history. The center also allows visitors the chance to communicate with Park Rangers and volunteers. Visitors can learn the day's weather readings, the time of low tide, get a National Park Passport stamped, visit the “Age of Exploration” exhibit, and learn the times for ranger talks/guided tours and auditorium showings. The auditorium offers several showings a day, and features three different films including: “In Search of Cabrillo,” “On the Edge of Land and Sea,” and “First Breath: Gray Whales.” Cabrillo National Monument also hosts a \"Junior Ranger\" program in which children can earn a Junior Ranger badge by exploring the park and filling out an activity sheet. In 2013, Junior Ranger Day was held on April 27.\n\nThere are many events throughout the year. Every year there are a few “Fee Free Weekends” where the park entrance fee is waived for all guests. Other annual events include “Whale Watch Weekend,” “Founder’s Day,” and “Open Tower Day.” “Whale Watch Weekend” occurs in January and features exhibitors and special ranger-led walks and talks as guests look for whales during the annual Pacific Gray Whales migration. “Founder’s Day,” August 25, celebrates the establishment of the National Park Service at Cabrillo National Monument; “Open Tower Day,” November 15, marks the anniversary of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse. The tower at the top of the lighthouse, normally closed to visitors, is open to the public on those two days. The park also has one of the fully restored World War II bunkers open to the public on the fourth Saturday of each month.\n\nA four-day commemoration of the park's centennial year had been planned for October 11–14, 2013, but it was cancelled due to the partial shutdown of United States government functions. The park rescheduled the centennial event to coincide with the annual \"Fort Rosecrans Goes to War,\" a tribute to San Diego and World War II, on December 7–8, 2013. Some of the other planned centennial events took place in 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2151949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2151949", "title": "Mott problem", "text": "Mott problem\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the Mott problem is a paradox that illustrates some of the difficulties of understanding the nature of wave function collapse and measurement in quantum mechanics. The problem was first formulated in 1929 by Sir Nevill Francis Mott and Werner Heisenberg, illustrating the paradox of the collapse of a spherically symmetric wave function into the linear tracks seen in a cloud chamber.\n\nIn practice, virtually all high energy physics experiments, such as those conducted at particle colliders, involve wave functions which are inherently spherical. Yet, when the results of a particle collision are detected, they are invariably in the form of linear tracks (see, for example, the illustrations accompanying the article on bubble chambers). It is somewhat strange to think that a spherically symmetric wave function should be observed as a straight track, and yet, this occurs on a daily basis in all particle collider experiments.\n\nA related variant formulation was given in 1953 by Mauritius Renninger, and is now known as Renninger's negative-result gedanken experiment. In this formulation, it is noted that the absence of a particle detection can also constitute a quantum measurement; namely, that a measurement can be performed even if no particle whatsoever is detected.\n\nIn the original 1929 formulation by Mott and Heisenberg, the spherical wave function of an alpha ray emitted from the decay of a radioactive atomic nucleus was considered. It was noted that the result of such a decay is always observed as linear tracks seen in Wilson's cloud chamber. Intuitively, one might think that such a wave function should randomly ionize atoms throughout the cloud chamber, but this is not the case. Mott demonstrated that by considering the interaction in configuration space, where all of the atoms of the cloud chamber play a role, it is overwhelmingly probable that all of the condensed droplets in the cloud chamber will lie close to the same straight line. What is uncertain is which straight line the wave packet will reduce to; the probability distribution of straight tracks is spherically symmetric.\n\nIn modern times, the Mott problem is occasionally considered theoretically in the context of astrophysics and cosmology, where the evolution of the wave function from the Big Bang or other astrophysical phenomena is considered.\n\n\n"}

The main park visitor center is in Mountainair. Construction of the missions began in 1622 and was completed in 1635.\n\nOnce, thriving Native American trade communities of Tiwa and Tompiro language-speaking Puebloans inhabited this remote frontier area of central New Mexico. Early in the 17th century Spanish Franciscans found the area ripe for their missionary efforts. However, by the late 1670s the entire Salinas District, as the Spanish had named it, was depopulated of both Indian and Spaniard. What remains today are austere yet beautiful reminders of this earliest contact between Pueblo Indians and Spanish Colonials: the ruins of three mission churches, at Quarai, Abó, and Gran Quivira and the partially excavated pueblo of Las Humanas or, as it is known today, the Gran Quivira pueblo.\n\nIt was first proclaimed Gran Quivira National Monument on November 1, 1909. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. On December 19, 1980 it was enlarged and two New Mexico State Monuments were absorbed into it on November 2, 1981. It was renamed on October 28, 1988.\n\nThe Quarai Ruins are located about 8 miles north of Mountainair, at about 6650 feet (2026 m) above sea level. There is a visitor center and a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) trail through the ruins. In a forest, an interpretive sign reads that when Francis Gardes traveled through the area, he heard birds sing a song called \"When Explorers Came\". Francis Gardes's trail became Francis Garde National Historic Trail, and it passes through Quarai.\n\nThe Abo Pueblo community was established in the 11th Century on the edge of the existing pueblo culture and was often attracted by roaming Nomadic Tribes of the eastern plains.\nSan Gregorio de Abó Mission (located in Mountainair, New Mexico) was one of three Spanish missions constructed in or near the pueblos of central New Mexico? These missions, built in 1600s, are now a part of the Salinas Pueblo National Monument which includes San Gregorio de Abó Mission, Quarai and Gran Quivera. \n\nThe mission at Abo was established in 1625 by Fray Francisco Fonte.\n\nThe Gran Quivira Ruins are located about 25 miles south of Mountainair, at about 6500 feet (1981 m) above sea level. There is a small visitor center near the parking lot. A 0.5 mile (0.8 km) trail leads through partially excavated pueblo ruins and the ruins of the uncompleted mission church.\n\nThe Gran Quivera Historic District was listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\n\n\n"}

The memorial confirms the ties that bind the United States and Mexico.\n\nOfficial statements indicate that it was initially designed as a gesture of goodwill and cooperation between the United States and Mexico, through the recognition of Coronado's 1540 expedition to the area. For example, in 1939 the House Committee on Foreign Affairs noted:\n\nAnd E. K. Burlew, Acting Secretary of the Interior added in 1940:\n\nThus the site was first designated Coronado International Memorial on August 18, 1941, with the hope that a comparable adjoining area would be established in Mexico. The arrangement might have been similar to the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park between the United States and Canada. However, despite interest by the government of Mexico, the Mexican memorial was never created, therefore Congress changed the authorized designation to a national memorial on July 9, 1952. The memorial was established by Harry S. Truman on November 5 of that year. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\n\n\n"}

The mountains are located about west of the Chocolate Mountains of Arizona, but the two ranges are not connected. The range reaches an elevation of 2,475 feet (754 m) at Mount Barrow, and serves as a drainage divide for the Salton Watershed to the west.\n\nThe mountains receive very little rainfall in a normal year, typically 4-6 inches (100 to 150 mm). The predominant natural plants are of the creosote bush–white bursage community, and the mean annual temperature is about to .\n\nThe range is composed of Precambrian basement rocks and Orocopia Schist with Mesozoic granite intrusions.\n\nThe range may have been formed by the collision of a microcontinental fragment with mainland Southern California during the Late Cretaceous. The collision is indicated by a thrust fault which emplaced Proterozoic and Mesozoic rocks of continental crust on top of the late Mesozoic Orocopia Schist which in turn was composed of oceanic sedimentary and volcanic rocks.\n\nThe range was host to numerous small gold workings in the 19th century with one, the Mesquite Mine to the east, continuing to be active into the 20th century.\n\nThe Bradshaw Trail passed by the side of the mountains, the first \"euroamerican\" route to the Colorado River from Riverside, California.\n\nThe mountain range is occupied by the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, an aerial and gunnery practice area used by the United States Navy and Marines. A large part of the Chocolate Mountains lies within the gunnery range, and is closed to the public.\n\nAt the southeastern end of the Chocolate Mountains range are two important wilderness areas. The first is the Little Picacho Wilderness, a 38,170 acre (154.5 km²) region of geological features and habitat protection under the direction of the Bureau of Land Management. The preserve has within its boundaries the southern portion of the Chocolate Mountains. Elevations within this area range from 200 to . The topography, characterized by jutting spires and steep ridges, is quite dramatic. Ravines laced within the range gradually broaden into sandy, tree-lined washes. Slopes and plains are devoid of vegetation, instead covered with a desert pavement of angular cobbles.

Out of the West Orange laboratories came the motion picture camera, improved phonographs, sound recordings, silent and sound movies and the nickel-iron alkaline electric storage battery.\n\nThe park comprises two properties in West Orange: the second Edison Laboratories complex, and Edison's home in Llewelyn Park about to the west.\n\nThe laboratory complex comprises the industrial facility built by Edison in 1887 to research and develop his inventions. The complex includes more than a dozen buildings that supported Edison's research into electricity, photography, motion pictures, chemistry, metallurgy, chemistry and other disciplines. A private library was attached to the main laboratory building. Specialty heavy and precision machine shops made tooling and prototypes.\n\nEdison's Queen Anne style home was designed by Henry Hudson Holly and built between 1880 and 1882 for Henry Pedder. It originally comprised 23 rooms. The mansion was built with gravity-convection central heat, indoor flush toilets, and hot and cold piped water. Pedder was found to have embezzled funds from his employer to build Glenmont, and was forced to surrender the estate, which Edison bought in 1886 for $125,000, moving in with his newly-married second wife Mina and his three children from his first marriage. The house retains its original furnishings in an Eastlake style interior. Edison added six more rooms, and electrical wiring.\n\nEdison's children with Mina grew up at Glenmont, including future New Jersey governor Charles Edison and industrialist Theodore Miller Edison\n\nThe history of how the site became a National Historical Park is complicated. Edison's home was designated as the Edison Home National Historic Site on December 6, 1955. The laboratory was designated as Edison Laboratory National Monument on July 14, 1956. On September 5, 1962, the site containing the home and the laboratory were designated the Edison National Historic Site and overseen by the National Park Service. On March 30, 2009, it was renamed Thomas Edison National Historical Park, adding \"Thomas\" to the title in hopes to relieve confusion between the Edison sites in West Orange and Edison, New Jersey. Following extensive renovations of the laboratory complex, there was a grand reopening on October 10, 2009.\n\nIn 1996, the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants recorded four songs on phonograph cylinder at the museum.

Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, and its surrounding property of . It is located in Cumberland Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, just outside Gettysburg. Purchased by then-General Eisenhower and his wife Mamie in 1950, the farm served as a weekend retreat for the President and a meeting place for world leaders, and became the Eisenhowers' home after they left the White House in 1961.\n\nWith its putting green, skeet range, and view of South Mountain and the Gettysburg Battlefield, it offered President Eisenhower a much-needed respite from the pressures of Washington. It was also a successful cattle operation, with a show herd of black Angus cattle. Some of the more notable of Eisenhower's guests were Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, President Charles de Gaulle of France, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain, and Governor Ronald Reagan of California (who later became President himself).\n\nDwight D. (\"Ike\") Eisenhower had a long history with the Gettysburg area. His graduating class from West Point had visited the battlefield in 1915. In 1918, he was assigned to nearby Camp Colt in his first independent command as an army officer, commanding a tank training unit; he and Mamie Eisenhower were newly married.\n\nThroughout his long army career, Dwight Eisenhower and his wife never had a house to call their own, with the couple moving from army post to army post. After he became Columbia University's president in 1948, Mamie requested that they finally have a place to call their own. A married couple that were friends with the Eisenhowers, George and Mary Allen, had recently purchased a small farm around Gettysburg, and recommended the area. In 1950, they found a \"run-down farm\" on the outskirts of Gettysburg, and purchased the farm and its for $40,000 (equal to $ today) from one Allen Redding, who had owned the farm since 1921. Eisenhower stated that he could feel the \"forgotten heroisms\" that occurred on the grounds as the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nWhen purchased, the included 600 chickens, 25 cows, and many dilapidated buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Renovation of the property was delayed when Eisenhower became supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1951. After he had attained the presidency of the United States in 1953, Mamie had him rebuild the old house. Much of the original building had to be torn down, due to its deterioration. The total cost of renovation was $250,000 (equal to $ today). This large expense was due partly to Mamie's whims, but also to Eisenhower's employment of union labor; he spent $65,000 (equal to $ today) for union workmen who came each day from Washington, D.C. ( away) to work on the farmhouse. On their 1955 wedding anniversary, the Eisenhowers held a party to celebrate completion of the work. The entire staff of the White House were invited, attending in two shifts, so that the White House would not be unstaffed. The staff were forever grateful to the Eisenhowers for including them in the festivities.\n\nFrom its completion in 1955 to the end of Eisenhower's second term on January 20, 1961, the President spent 365 days total on the Gettysburg farm. The longest of these stays was 38 days in late 1955, while recovering from a heart attack he had suffered that September. After 1955, the Eisenhowers spent most weekends and summer vacations at the Gettysburg farm. They sometimes went to both the Gettysburg farm and Camp David, prompting one person to call Camp David \"an annex to Gettysburg\".\nThe Gettysburg farm provided a few headaches. Democrats chose the amount of time the Eisenhowers spent at the Gettysburg farm as another way to attack him. Paul M. Butler, head of the Democratic National Committee, called him a part-time president due to his many stays in Gettysburg. When his World War II colleague Bernard Montgomery visited the farm, Eisenhower commented to Montgomery (speaking as military commander to military commander) that he would have fired a subordinate that would initiate Pickett's Charge. Many Southerners saw this as disrespect toward Robert E. Lee, and protested. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the farm in September 1959, and was \"grandfathery\" to the Eisenhower grandchildren. David Eisenhower said that Khrushchev was such a nice guy, he (David) could become a Communist if he did not know better, causing much embarrassment to the Eisenhowers.\n\nThe Eisenhowers donated their home and farm ( total at the time) to the National Park Service in 1967, with lifetime living rights for the former president. Two years later, Eisenhower died at the age of 78. Mamie Eisenhower rejected the idea of moving to Washington to be closer to family and friends and, with Federal permission, lived on the farm until her death in 1979, although the living area for Mamie was reduced to . The National Park Service opened the site in 1980.\n\nThe plans for decoration and construction of the house were dictated by Mamie Eisenhower. At one point, Eisenhower told the contractor \"For God's sakes, just give her what she wants and send me the bill.\" His main concern was personally mixing the paint to recolor the barn, which had a red coat he thought was hideous, so he painted it a light gray-green. Mamie, meanwhile, was delighted in being able to use everything they always had in storage, and decorated more for sentimentality than for aesthetics.\n\nCattle were raised at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun to show what quality of steak the animal would eventually produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved to do on the farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.\n\nA row of fifty Norway spruce trees lines the main driveway leading to the farm. These trees represent the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents from each of the state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it was seen as a mark of Eisenhower's recovery that he was able to walk that far after his heart attack.\n\nThe Eisenhowers (especially Dwight in the beginning) spent most of their time in a glass-covered porch overlooking Seminary Ridge. Reading and playing cards with friends were popular pastimes on the porch, it was said that he would sit for hours reflecting on his life and legacy.\n\nThe Eisenhower National Historic Site is open daily from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. The home, grounds, barns and cattle operation are available for public tours. Visitors may reach the site via a shuttle bus which departs from the Gettysburg National Military Park Visitor Center.

Marquette established Michigan's earliest European settlements at Sault Ste. Marie and St. Ignace near Mackinac Island in 1668 and 1671. He lived among the Great Lakes Indians from 1666 to his death in 1675. During these nine years, Father Marquette mastered several native languages and joined Louis Jolliet in his expedition to explore and map a navigable route to the Pacific Ocean, which resulted in the French discovery of the Mississippi River.\n\nThe Marquette and Joliet expeditions explored the Fox River, the Mississippi River as far as Arkansas, the Illinois River, and the Chicago River. They did not proceed to the mouth of the Mississippi due to hostility of the natives and fear of confronting Spanish colonials.\n\nIn October 1674, Marquette and two companions set out on a missionary expedition.

It was the second work in the Ku Klux Klan trilogy by Thomas Dixon Jr. that also included \"The Leopard's Spots\" and \"The Traitor\". It presents the Ku Klux Klan heroically. The novel was twice notably adapted, immediately by its author as a highly successful play entitled \"The Clansman\" (1905), and a decade later by D. W. Griffith in the famous 1915 movie \"The Birth of a Nation\". The 20th-century revival of the Ku Klux Klan is a direct result of its glorification by Dixon.\n\nThe play, being concerned with the KKK and Reconstruction, is adapted in the second half of \"The Birth of a Nation\". According to Professor Russell Merritt, key differences between the play and film are that Dixon was more sympathetic to Southerners' pursuing education and modern professions, whereas Griffith stressed ownership of plantations.\n\nDixon wrote \"The Clansman\" in support of racial segregation, as it showed free blacks turning savage and violent, committing crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery far out of proportion to their percentage of the population. He claimed that 18,000,000 Southerners supported his beliefs. Dixon portrays the Radical Republican speaker of the house, Austin Stoneman (based on Thaddeus Stevens, from Pennsylvania), as a rapacious, vindictive, negro-loving legislator, mad with power and eaten up with hate. His goal is to punish the Southern whites for their revolution against an \"oppressive\" government (the Union) by turning the former slaves against the white Southerners and using the iron fist of the Union occupation troops to make them the new masters. The Klan's job is to protect the white Southerners from the carpetbaggers and their allies, black and white.\n\nIn addition to criticism that \"The Clansman\" would stir up feelings in the South, Dixon's argument that the Klan had saved the South from negro rule was ridiculed by some as absurd.\n\n\nIn \"The Clansman\", Reconstruction was an attempt by Augustus Stoneman, a thinly-veiled reference to Representative Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, to ensure that the Republican Party would stay in power by securing the Southern black vote. Stoneman's hatred for President Johnson stems from Johnson's refusal to disenfranchise Southern whites. His anger towards former slaveholders is intensified after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, when he vows revenge on the South. His programs strip away the land owned by whites, giving it to former slaves. (See Forty acres and a mule.) Men claiming to represent the government confiscate the material wealth of the South, destroying plantation-owning families. Finally, the former slaves are taught that they are superior to their former owners and should rise up against them. These injustices are the impetuses for the creation of the Klan.\n\nSimilar to his statements about \"The Leopard's Spots\", Dixon insists in a \"To the reader\" prologue that the novel is historical:\n\nI have sought to preserve in this romance both the letter and the spirit of this remarkable period. The men who enact the drama of fierce revenge into which I have woven a double love-story are historical figures. I have merely changed their names without taking a liberty with any essential historic fact.\n\nThe publication of \"The Clansman\" caused significant uproar not only in the North, but throughout the South. Thomas Dixon was denounced for renewing old conflicts and glorifying what many thought was an unfortunate part of American history.\n\nWhen offered membership in the KKK, Dixon reportedly turned it down because, he claimed, he did not agree with the Klan's methods. The Klokard of the Klan, Rev. Dr. Oscar Haywood, at one point challenged Dixon to a debate over the nature of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nDespite Dixon's reported claims that he rejected violence except in self-defense, in the book previous to \"The Clansman\" in Dixon's trilogy, \"The Leopard's Spots\", the Klan dealt thusly with a black man who had asked a white woman to kiss him:\n\nDixon's novel is often contraposed with Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"; Dixon himself described it as a sequel. The character of Gus in \"The Clansman\", who is shown as the worst kind of former slave, going as far as to rape a white woman, is the opposite of the benevolent Uncle Tom, who is portrayed as angelic. The books are also similar for the reactions they stirred up among their readers. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was detested and banned throughout the South, while \"The Clansman\" was ranted against in Northern papers. Also like \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", \"The Clansman\" reached its greatest audience not through its book form, which sold over 100,000 copies, but through the subsequent play, that had an audience of millions.\n\nIn the introduction to a university press edition of the book in 1970, an era of high interest in civil rights, historian Thomas D. Clark wrote:\n\nIn 1915, when \"Birth of a Nation\" appeared, \"The Clansman\" was best known as a play. Much of the movie is taken from the play, rather than directly from the novel.\n\nDixon rewrote the novel as a play In order to further publicize his views. \"In most cases, Dixon's adaptation of a novel for the stage was merely intended to present his message to a larger audience, for his avowed purpose as a writer was to reach as many people as possible.\" He enrolled in a correspondence course given by the one-man American School of Playwriting, of William Thompson Price. Price was \"the greatest critic of the theater since Aristotle\"; Dixon also compares him with Daniel Boone and Henry Clay, adding \"The State of Kentucky has given the nation no greater man.\" Apparently as an advertisement for the school, he reproduced in the program his handwritten thank-you note. (At the time, reproducing handwriting was expensive, and to send a handwritten, as opposed to typed, letter was an indication of special esteem.)November 11, 1905My dear Mr. Price,Thanks for your letter of congratulations. It is for me to thank you for invaluable aid as my instructor in the technique of playwriting.I learned more from your course in one year than I could have gotten in ten years unaided. It is new, not found in books, thorough and practical. The student who neglects this course is missing the opportunity of a life <nowiki>[</nowiki>sic<nowiki>]</nowiki>. I could never have written \"The Clansman\" without the grasp of its principles. Our assocation has been an inspiration to me from the first.Sincerely,<br>Thomas Dixon Jr.\nThe contract for the production specified, at Dixon's request, that Dixon would pay half the cost of the production, and have half ownership. He chose the cast and had a \"secret power in the...management of the company\". \"The production of the play became the most fascinating adventure on which I had ever embarked. I lived in a dream world with dream people. I never worked so hard or so happily in my life. Work was play, thrilling, glorious, inspiring play.\"\n\nFour horses in Klan costumes \"raced across the stage in a climax. The horses were ridden in the streets as advertising.\"\n\nIn Montgomery, Alabama, and Macon, Georgia, the play was banned. The next day the Washington Post, in an editorial, called for the same to be done in Washington, saying the play was abominable, stupid, and misleading:\n\nThe play does not possess even the merit of historic truth. It is as false as \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and a hundred times more wicked, for it excites the passions and prejudices of the dominant class at the expense of the defenseless minority. We can imagine no circumstances under which its production would be useful or wholesome, since it disgusts the judicious and the well-informed, and exerts an influence only upon the ignorant, the credulous, and the ill disposed. But in the present condition of the public mind at the South it is a firebrand, a counsel of barbarity, in fact, a crime.\n\nIn an effort to prevent a performance in Washington, D.C., a group of pastors appealed to President Theodore Roosevelt to intercede on their behalf.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the play was banned after it opened by Mayor Weaver, who said that \"the tendency of the play is to produce racial hatred\". At the opening rotten eggs were thrown at the actors.\n\nThe play, despite these protests, was extremely popular in the South. It opened with a huge premiere in Norfolk, Virginia, and drew record-breaking audiences in Columbia, South Carolina, and In fact, the vast majority of news stories about \"The Clansman\" have to do with the play, not the novel.\n\nIn Bainbridge, Georgia, a black man was lynched shortly after presentation of the play in October, 1905. A newspaper article reported it under the title: \"Lynching Laid to 'The Clansman'. Georgia Mob, Wrought Up by Dixon's Story, Hangs Negro Murderer.\" \"The feeling against negroes, never kindly, has been embittered by the Dixon play, following which stories of negroes' depredations during the reconstruction period have been revived, and whites have been wrought up to a high tension.\"\n\nAccording to news stories, the \"mob\" which lynched three negroes in Springfield, Missouri in April, 1906, \"seemed filled with the spirit of 'The Clansman', which created such a strong anti-negro feeling here six weeks ago.\" Dixon called this attribution \"the acme of absurdity\", claiming that the play had reduced lynchings. The lynching in Springfield, he opined, \"was caused by the commission of a crime by negroes—a crime so horrible and revolting to every instinct of white manhood that a whole community went mad with rage for justice, swift and terrible. Such things have happened in the south before and they will happen again so long as such crimes are committed by negroes.\"\n\nThe play had an opulent 60-page program, with pictures, sold at the high price of 50¢ when a newspaper cost 5¢. It included \"A Portrait and Sketch of the Author\", and \"Mr. Dixon's Famous Articles on 'The Future of the Negro', 'The Story of the Ku Klux Klan', and 'What Our Nation owes to the Klan.\n\nA four-page program of a traveling production, held by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois, tells us that \"Hundreds [were] turned away at every performance since the memorable opening in Norfolk, VA., Sept, 22, 1905\".\n\nThe play was not published until 2007. A scholar says it was not only not published, it was not printed, but with so many involved in the production — two companies were touring simultaneously — copies had to be printed for internal use. Two such copies are known, one in the Library of Congress, the other in the Cortland Free Library.\n\nThomas Dixon's novel did not have the immediate effect of causing the recreation of the Ku Klux Klan. Neither did the subsequent play. The release of the movie \"The Birth of a Nation\" in 1915 finally let Dixon's work reach an audience large enough to start the resurrection of the Klan.\n\nOne of the images most commonly associated with the Klan, that of a burning Latin cross, was actually taken from \"The Clansman\", but was not used by the original Klan. Dixon, who had Scottish ancestry, drew upon the Scottish tradition of the \"Crann Tara\", a burning cross used to call clan members to arms, as inspiration for the depiction of cross burning. The Klan's white robes are also an invention of Dixon, and he protested their appropriation of the \"livery\" he created.\n\n\n"}

Located within the Davis Mountains of West Texas, the historic site was established in 1961 to protect one of the best remaining examples of a United States Army fort in the southwestern United States.\n\nEstablished in October 1854 along the Limpia Creek at Painted Comanche Camp by Bvt. Maj. Gen. Persifor Frazer Smith, Fort Davis was named after Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. \"Hoping to protect the garrison from winter northers, Smith tucked the fort into a canyon flanked on three sides by sheer rock walls.\" Commanding the post was 8th Infantry Regiment commander Lt. Col. Washington Seawell.\n\nOther forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Richardson, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. \"Sub posts or intermediate stations\" also were used, including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.\n\nFrom 1854 to 1891, Fort Davis was strategically located to protect emigrants, mail coaches, and freight wagons on the trans-Pecos portion of the San Antonio-El Paso Road and the Chihuahua Trail, and to control activities on the southern stem of the Great Comanche War Trail and Mescalero Apache war trails.\n\nThe fort was evacuated in April 1861 under orders from General David E. Twiggs at the start of the Civil War. During John R. Baylor's invasion of New Mexico, only 20 Confederate States Army troops manned the fort. On the night of 4 August 1861, Mescalero Apaches raided a nearby cattle pen, and during the pursuit on 11 August, Lt. Reuben E. Mays and all but one of his 13-man patrol were killed in an ambush. This defeat convinced Baylor to staff the fort with three officers and 70 enlisted men. The Confederates evacuated the fort and all other posts west of Fort Clark in August 1862.\n\nFort Davis is important in understanding the presence of African Americans in the West and in the frontier military because the 24th and 25th U.S. Infantry regiments and the 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry regiments, all-black regiments (known as the buffalo soldiers), which were established after the Civil War, were stationed at the post. Lt. Col. Wesley Merritt led Troops C, F, H, and I of the 9th Cavalry in reoccupying the fort on 29 June 1867. They rebuilt the fort, using limestone and adobe, outside the canyon walls.\n\nToday, 24 restored historic buildings and over 100 ruins and foundations are part of Fort Davis National Historic Site. Five of the historic buildings have been refurbished to the 1880s, making it easy for visitors to envision themselves being at the fort at the height of its development. A self-guided tour of the fort begins at the site's visitor center. Living history demonstrations are common during the summer.\n\nFort Davis National Historic Site was authorized as a unit of the National Park System in 1961, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n\nThe actress Jolene Brand portrayed \"Indian Emily\", who saved the fort from an Apache attack, in the 1959 episode of the same name on the syndicated television anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Stanley Andrews. Emily adopts the white man's ways but flees when a young officer, Tom Easton (Burt Metcalfe), whom she loves prepares to marry another. She returns to warn the fort of a pending Apache attack but dies of a gunshot wound fired in error. Meg Wyllie played Tom's compassionate mother, Mrs. Easton. A memorial at Fort Davis honors the heroism of Indian Emily.\n\n\n"}

The first fort at this site was established by the United States in 1817, before this area was established as part of Indian Territory. It was later replaced and the second fort was operated by the US until 1871. This site was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961.\n\nThe fort was the first site of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which had jurisdiction over western Arkansas and all of Indian Territory. It began operations in 1875 with the appointment of Isaac C. Parker as the first federal district judge here. The town of Fort Smith, Arkansas developed around the fort. \n\nThe site includes the second historic fort constructed at this place. In addition, located on the grounds are the foundation remains of the first Fort Smith (1817–1824), the commissary building (c. 1838) and a reconstruction of the gallows used by the federal court. A walking trail along the Arkansas River includes wayside exhibits on the Trail of Tears. \n\nCongress authorized acquisition of land on the Oklahoma bank of the Arkansas River to be included in the National Historic Site, in order to preserve a historic viewshed, but it has not been acquired.\n\nThe park visitor center is now located in the old Barracks/Courthouse/Jail building. Exhibits in the visitor center focus on Fort Smith's military history from 1817–1871, its role in the western expansion of the United States, Federal District Judge Isaac Parker and the federal court's effects on justice in Indian Territory, the U.S. Deputy Marshals and outlaws, Federal Indian policy, and Indian Removal, including the Cherokee Trail of Tears.\n\nThe site was established in 1961 in order to protect the remains of two 19th-century U.S. military forts, including a building that once housed the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which had jurisdiction over federal cases in Indian Territory. Fort Smith was also notable as a major stop for the Cherokee people along the \"Trail of Tears.\" during the period of Indian Removal from the Southeast. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.\n\nThe original fort was established on December 25, 1817 by Major William Bradford in order to maintain harmony between the local Osage Indians, who had long been dominant in this territory, and a band of Cherokee who had migrated west, under pressure from European Americans, from their traditional territory in the Southeast. This time would later be historically referenced as the \"First Fort.\" It ended in 1824 when the U.S. Army abandoned Fort Smith after constructing Fort Gibson further west.\n\nAs a result of the increased tensions Indians following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and local white settlers who encroached on their territory, the U.S. Army created a second Fort Smith in 1838 near the original's ruins. This is the beginning of the historical \"Second Fort\" period. During General Zachary Taylor's command of the fort in the 1840s, it became a supply depot for other forts within the Indian Territory. It was captured during the Civil War from Confederate forces in 1863 by Union troops. The majority of the Cherokee and other Five Civilized Tribes had initially allied with the Confederacy, and supplied warriors to its forces. The fort continued in use as a supply depot to other forts in the region until it was no longer occupied in an official capacity by 1871; historically the end of the \"Second Fort\" era.\n\nAs often happened, a small town developed around the fort, with people attracted for business. In addition, court operations continued at a courthouse built in town for the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which presided over the western half of Arkansas and all of Indian Territory. It was first held at the fort, as noted above. The first federal district judge here was Isaac C. Parker, who presided over the court from 1875 to 1896.\n\n\n"}

The fort site is about two miles from the confluence of the Missouri River and its tributary, the Yellowstone River, on the North Dakota/Montana border, 25 miles from Williston, North Dakota.\n\nIn 1961, the site became one of the earliest declared National Historic Landmarks in the United States and was named Fort Union Trading Post by the National Park Service to differentiate it from Fort Union National Monument, a historic frontier Army post in New Mexico.\n\nThe historic site interprets how portions of the fort may have looked in 1851, based on archaeological excavations as well as drawings by contemporaries, including Rudolf Kurz, the post clerk in 1851.\n\nFort Union, possibly first known as Fort Henry or Fort Floyd, was built in 1828 or 1829 by the Upper Missouri Outfit managed by Kenneth McKenzie and was capitalized by John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. Until 1867, Fort Union was the central, and busiest, trading post on the upper Missouri, instrumental in developing the fur trade in Montana. Here Assiniboine, Crow, Cree, Ojibwe, Blackfoot, Hidatsa, Lakota, and other tribes traded buffalo robes and furs for trade goods including beads, clay pipes, guns, blankets, knives, cookware, cloth, and alcohol. Historic visitors to the fort included John James Audubon, Sha-có-pay, Captain Joseph LaBarge, Kenneth McKenzie, Father Pierre DeSmet, George Catlin, Sitting Bull, Karl Bodmer, Hugh Glass, and Jim Bridger.\n\nAt first, Indians traded beaver pelts for Euro-American goods because of the popularity of beaver hats in the East and in Europe. When silk and woolen hats became more popular during the 1830s, demand for beaver pelts decreased, and the trade shifted to bison robes.\n\nDuring the historical period, Fort Union served as a haven for many frontier people and contributed to further economic growth on the American frontier. As headquarters for the American Fur Company, it played a primary role in the growth of the fur trade and allowed fur trade entrepreneurs to exert considerable influence in forming policies that affected the Indian nations of the region. The presence of the fort near the northern border of the United States also symbolized national sovereignty in the region.\n\nThe fort maintained a large inventory of firearms that were traded with Indian tribes for furs. In turn, Indians used the firearms in hunting for furs and buffalo robes. Northern Plains Indians preferred the English-made \"North West Gun,\" a smooth-bore flintlock, because of its reputation for quality and reliability.\n\nConflicts between Euro-American traders and Indians were less frequent around Fort Union than conflicts between the Indian tribes themselves. However, during the summer of 1863, when many tribes along the Missouri River became openly hostile to whites, Fort Union was nearly under siege, and steamboats and their passengers were exposed to significant danger.\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the Meccan Quraysh leaders who opposed Muhammad and his followers and was condemned in the surah \"Lahab\" (Surah al-Massad) of the Quran for antagonizing Islam.\n\nHe was born in Mecca c. 549, the son of Abdul Muttalib, chief of the Hashim clan, and the paternal grandfather of Muhammad. He was thus a paternal half-brother of Abdullah, father of Muhammad. His mother, Lubna bint Hajar, was from the Khuza'a tribe. People from the Khuza'a tribe were the caretakers of the Ka'bah for several centuries, before the Quraysh took over the responsibility through their ancestor Qusai ibn Kilab. Abu Lahab was also related to Muhammad as half-uncle in another way, since Muḥammad's grandmother was Fāṭimah bint ‘Amr of Banu Makhzūm clan.\n\nHis original name was 'Abd al-'Uzzā, but his father called him \"Abū Lahab\" (\"Father of Flame\") \"because of his beauty and charm\" due to his red (inflamed) cheeks. He is described as \"an artful spruce fellow with two locks of hair, wearing an Aden cloak\" and as \"very generous\".\n\nHe married Arwā Umm Jamīl bint Harb, sister of Abu Sufyān (Sakhr), whose father Ḥarb was chief of the Umayya clan. Their children included Utbah, Utaybah, Muattab, Durrah (Fakhita), 'Uzzā and Khālida. Abu Lahab had another son, also named Durrah, who may have been born by another woman. He may also have been the father of Masruh, a son born to his slave Thuwayba.\n\nHis daughter Durrah embraced Islam and became a narrator of Hadīth. One is in Ahmad’s \"Musnad\", where she reports that a man got up and asked the Prophet, “Who is the best of the people?” He answered, “The best of the people is the most learned, the most godfearing, the most to be enjoining virtue, the most to be prohibiting vice and the most to be joining the kin.”\n\n‘Utbah also embraced Islam after the conquest of Mecca and pledged allegiance to Muḥammad.\n\nWhen Muhammad announced that he had been instructed by God to spread the message of Islam openly, the Quran told him to warn his kinsfolk about divine punishment. He therefore climbed Mount Ṣafā and shouted: \"\"Wa ṣabāḥah!\"\" which means, \"O [calamity of] the morning!\" In Arabia this alarm was traditionally raised by any person who noticed an enemy tribe advancing against his own tribe at dawn.\n\nOn hearing this, the inhabitants of Mecca assembled at the mountain. Muhammad then addressed the clans by name. \"O Banū Hāshim, O Banū 'Abd al-Muṭallib ... [and so on], if I were to tell you that behind this hill there is an enemy about to attack you, would you believe me?\" The people responded that they would, since Muhammad was known to be honest. He continued saying: \"Then I warn you that you are heading for a torment.\"\n\nAt this point, Abu Lahab interrupted: \"Woe be on you the rest of the day! Is that what you summoned us for?\" Another tradition recalls Abū Lahab picking up a stone to throw at his nephew.. \n\nAbu Lahab rejected the claims of Muhammad and said: \"Muhammad promises me things which I do not see. He alleges that they will happen after my death; what has he put in my hands after that?” Then he blew on his hands and said, “May you perish. I can see nothing in you of the things that Muhammad says.”\n\nAs a direct result of this incident, a chapter of the Quran, \"Al-Masad\" (\"The Palm Fibre\"), was revealed about him. Its English translation by Sahih International reads:\n\nIn the name of Allah, the most compassionate, the most merciful (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)\n\nUmm Jamil is called “the bearer of the wood” because she is said to have carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's pathway. Being a next-door neighbor to Muḥammad, she also threw garbage over the wall into Muhammad's house.\n\nAbu Lahab had married two of his sons to the daughters of Muḥammad, 'Utbah to Ruqayyah and 'Utaibah to Umm Kulthum. However, the marriages were never consummated. After the announcement of \"Al-Masadd\", Abu Lahab told his sons: \"My head is unlawful to your head if you do not divorce Muhammad's daughters.\" They therefore divorced them. Abu Lahab's daughter Durrah was at some stage married to Zaid ibn Ḥarīthah, who was at that time regarded as Muhammad's son, and they were later divorced; but the timing of this marriage and divorce is not known. Later, she married Ḥārith ibn Naufal of Banu Hāshim; and after his death, she married Dihya ibn Khalifa.\n\nWhen the Quraysh began to torture the Muslims, Abu Lahab's brother Abu Talib called upon the Hashim and Al-Muttalib clans to stand with him in protecting his nephew. It was a custom among the Arabs to staunchly support their own clan. Despite the dissension between Muḥammad and some members of Banu Hashim & Banu Muṭṭalib, most of them stood by him in his predicaments and provided him protection and security except Abu Lahab.\n\nWhile Muhammad was praying near the Kaaba, Abu Jahl once threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him. Muhammad later told Aisha: \"I was between two bad neighbours, Abu Lahab and Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt. They brought excrements and threw them before my door and they brought offensive material and threw it before my door.\" Muhammad said he came out of his house, saying: \"O sons of Abdumanaf! Is it the behaviour of a neighbour?\" and threw the rubbish away.\n\nOn the 7th year of preaching Islam, the Quraysh imposed boycott on Banu Hāshim & Banu Muṭṭalib and forced them to live in a mountain gorge outside the city. Most of the members of Banu Hāshim had not accepted Islam at that time. Yet they stood by Muḥammad and suffered as much as he did. Abu Lahab was the only member of Banu Hāshim who supported the boycott and did not join his clan. Through a deep sense of animosity, Abu Lahab violated this ‘Arab tradition and took the side of non-Muslim Quraysh clans. Abu Lahab renounced his affiliation with the Hashim clan and remained in Mecca. Soon afterwards, he met his sister-in-law, Hind bint Utbah, and said to her, \"Haven’t I helped Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, and haven’t I abandoned those who have abandoned them and assisted their opponents?” She replied, “Yes, and may god reward you well, O Abu Utba.”\n\nAfter the boycott was lifted, another nephew, Abu Salama, came to Abu Talib asking for protection. When the Makhzum clan protested about this, Abu Lahab supported his brother. He told the Makhzumites: “O Quraysh, you have continually attacked this \"shaykh\" for giving his protection among his own people. By God, you must either stop this or we will stand in with him until he gains his object.” The Makhzumites wanted to keep Abu Lahab's support, and therefore they agreed not to annoy Abu Salama.\n\nAbu Talib died in 620, From this time, Muhammad went around the trade fairs and markets to tell the Arab tribes that he was a prophet and call them to worship Allah. Abu Lahab used to follow him around the fairs, saying, “This fellow wishes only to get you to strip off Al-Lat and Al-Uzza from your necks and your allies of the Malik ibn Uqaysh tribe for the misleading innovation he has brought. Don’t obey him and take no notice of him.”\n\nSomeone reported: “Before my own Islam I used to see the Prophet in markets outside Makkah calling out: ‘People, say there is no deity save Allah and you will prosper.’ People would gather around him but a man, bright faced, intelligent looking, with two locks of hair (hanging down), would appear from the rear and say: ‘This man has renounced the religion (of his forefathers). He is a liar.’ He followed the Prophet wherever he went. The people would enquire who he was to learn that it was his (the Prophet's) uncle.’”\n\nOnce Abu Lahab chased and hit Muḥammad with stones in one of those markets. He hit so hard that his feet began to bleed profusely and his slippers were filled with his own blood causing great pain and difficulty in walking.\n\nMuhammad and most of the Muslims left Mecca in 622, and Abu Lahab had no further direct interaction with his nephew.\n\nWhen the rest of the Quraysh went to Badr to protect the merchant-caravan carrying their property from an expected attack, Abu Lahab remained in Mecca, sending in his place Abu Jahl's brother al-‘Āṣ ibn Hishām who owed him four thousand dirhams that he could not pay. So he hired him with them on the condition that he should be cleared off his debt.\n\nThe first people to reach Mecca with the news of the Quraysh defeat in the Battle of Badr were al-Haysuman and 'Abdullāh ibn al-Khuzā'ī, who bewailed the fact that so many of their chieftains had fallen on the battlefield. Abu Lahab went to the large tent of Zamzam, \"his face as black as thunder\". Before long, his nephew Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith arrived, so he called him over for news. A small crowd gathered around the two as Abū Sufyān told his uncle, \"The facts are the Quraysh met our enemy and turned their backs. They [the Muslims] put us to flight, taking prisoners as they pleased. I cannot blame our tribesmen because they faced not only them but men wearing white robes riding piebald horses, who were between heaven and earth. They spared nothing, and no one had a chance.\"\n\nAt the other end of the tent, a Muslim freedman named Abu Rafi' and Abbas's wife Lubaba sat sharpening arrows. When they heard the news of the men in white riding between heaven and earth, they could no longer contain their happiness, and Abu Rafi exclaimed: \"They were angels!\" Abu Lahab was so furious that he forced the frail Abu Rafi' to the ground and beat him up. Lubaba grabbed a nearby tent pole and hit her brother-in-law over the head, crying: \"Do you think that you can abuse him just because Abbas is away?\"\n\nLubaba wounded Abu Lahab so severely that his head was split open, laying bare part of his skull. The wound turned septic, and his entire body erupted into open pustules. He died a week later. This would have been in late March 624.\nThe smell from Abu Lahab's wound was so repulsive that nobody could come near him. His family left his decaying body decomposing in his home for two or three nights until a neighbour rebuked them. \"It is disgraceful. You should be ashamed of leaving your father to rot in his house and not bury him from the sight of men!\" They then sent in slaves to remove his body. It was watered from a distance, then pushed with poles into a grave outside Mecca, and stones were thrown over it.\n\nA Muslim narration says that after Abu Lahab's death, some of his relatives had a dream in which they saw him suffering in Hell. He told them that he had experienced no comfort in the Afterlife, but that his sufferings had been remitted \"this much\" (indicating the space between his thumb and index finger) because of his one virtuous deed of manumitting his slave Thuwayba, who had briefly suckled Muhammad.\n"}

Frederick Law Olmsted (1822–1903) is recognized as the founder of American landscape architecture and the nation's foremost parkmaker of the 19th century. In 1883, Olmsted moved his home to suburban Boston and established \"Fairsted\", the world's first full-scale professional office for the practice of landscape design. Over the course of the next century, his sons and successors expanded and perpetuated Olmsted's design ideals, philosophy, and influence.\n\nThe site is located at 99 Warren Street, in the Green Hill section of Brookline. Olmsted bought the Clark homestead, an 1810 Federal farmhouse, in 1883, to be near his frequent collaborator, H. H. Richardson, whose home and office were nearby. Olmsted and his son John Charles renovated the house, landscaped the property, and relocated the barn closer to the house, and in 1903 added the office wing to the northwest of the main house. Members of the Olmsted family occupied the main house until 1936, when Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. moved to Elkton, Maryland, renting the house to tenants. The offices of the Olmsted Brothers firm continued to be in the wing during this time, although business also declined. Members of the firm reoccupied the house in the 1960s, making substantial alterations to the original landscaping of the property. The property was acquired by the National Park Service in 1980. The grounds have been restored to a c. 1930 appearance, restoring much of Olmsted's landscaping.\n\nPark resources include the restored \"Fairsted\" historic landscape, and the design office (which remains virtually unchanged from the days when the Olmsted firm's activity was at its height.) Housed within the office complex are nearly 1,000,000 original design records detailing work on many of America's most treasured landscapes, including the grounds of the U. S. Capitol and White House; Great Smoky Mountains and Acadia National Parks; Yosemite Valley; New York's Central Park; and whole park systems in cities such as Buffalo, Seattle, Boston, Louisville and Montreal. The Olmsteds also played an influential role in the creation of the National Park Service, which now owns and maintains the Olmsted site.\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site is open to the public. The Park Service offers guided tours of the grounds and office wing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152057", "title": "KAMP-FM", "text": "KAMP-FM\n\nKAMP-FM (97.1 FM, \"97.1 AMP\") is a commercial radio station in Los Angeles, California, United States. The station is owned by Entercom and airs a Top 40 (CHR) radio format. The station has studios at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Hauser Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, and the transmitter on Mount Wilson.\n\nKAMP-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The KAMP-HD2 subchannel carries \"Channel Q\", an LGBTQ-oriented talk/EDM format from Radio.com. KAMP-HD3 airs a non-stop dance mixshow format billed as \"Fire Lane\".\n\nKAMP is one of two top 40 stations in the Los Angeles area, the other being KIIS-FM (102.7 FM) which is owned by IHeart Media\n\nIn 1954, the station signed on as KFMU and operated under those call letters during the 1950s and early mid-1960s. It was originally licensed to the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale and was owned by Nicolas M. Brazy. KFMU aired an easy listening format known as \"Good Music\". The station was a subsidiary of Metropolitan Theatres Corp., which by 1959 was program testing KFMW in San Bernardino and held a permit for a KFMX in San Diego, as well as two other stations.\n\nIn the late 1960s, KFMU was purchased by Storer Broadcasting and became home to KGBS-FM, as a sister station to KGBS (1020 AM). The two stations carried a country music format. Since its AM station was a daytimer, only authorized to be on the air during daylight hours, the FM station allowed the format to be heard around the clock, for those who had FM radios. In the early 1970s, the station experimented with rock and roll and pop music formats before switching to a soft country format in 1973, when it adopted the name \"Gentle Country\". In 1976, KGBS-FM continued with its country music format while its AM sister station switched to top 40. On August 28, 1978, the FM station changed its call letters to KHTZ while continuing with its country music format.\n\nOn July 31, 1979, Storer, after having sold the AM radio station which was now known as KTNQ (Ten-Q), moved its top-40 format to 97.1 FM and began broadcasting as KHTZ (\"K-Hits\"). For a few hours, the two stations simulcast the signal until KTNQ switched to Spanish-language programming at noon. Within a few weeks, the station evolved into a more adult contemporary station. On November 27, 1985, the station changed its call letters to KBZT and was known as \"K-Best 97\".\n\nOn September 26, 1986 at 3 p.m., the station was renamed KLSX and flipped to a classic rock format. The call letters KLSX were chosen to sound like the word \"classics\".\n\nTo demonstrate the vastness of the station's on-air library, KLSX advertised \"no-repeat workdays\", not playing any song more than once per day. Each day, the station played one song twice as part of a contest; listeners could win a prize for being the destination caller and identify correctly the intentionally repeated track. Additionally, KLSX hosted an annual \"A—Z\" event where the entire library was played in alphabetical order by artist during weekday hours, a playlist that ran about 100 hours. Whenever the station played \"Southern Man\" by Neil Young, it was always followed by Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\n\nIn 1988, the long-running Beatles show \"Breakfast with the Beatles\" with host Deirdre O'Donoghue moved to KLSX from KNX-FM, a show which she began doing on KMET in 1983. After she died in 2001, the show was taken over by Chris Carter. On September 3, 2006, the station broadcast the last airing of \"Breakfast with the Beatles\", which was then replaced by infomercials, drawing some local protest. Then-host Carter has stated that the departure of Howard Stern can be attributed to why the program was dropped. Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono have all called into the program. In late November 2006, local classic rock KLOS picked up the show.\n\nOn July 21, 1991, the station began to air the syndicated \"Howard Stern Show\", and took on the slogan \"Howard Stern all morning, classic rock all day\".\n\nOn July 31, 1995, KLSX changed to a hot talk format on weekdays and went by the moniker \"Real Radio 97.1\", and had hosts such as Susan Olsen and Ken Ober, Scott Ferrall, Riki Rachtman, Kato Kaelin, Mother Love, Carlos Oscar, Voxx, and the Regular Guys (Larry Wachs and Eric von Haessler). Howard Stern was critical of this format change and referred to it as \"Hindenburg Radio\". In 1996, the station dropped the \"Real Radio\" name and became known as \"The FM Talk Station\", hiring new hosts; the following year, the station began carrying the syndicated \"Tom Leykis Show\", becoming its flagship station. On April 1, 2002, KLSX temporarily brought back Kaelin and the \"Real Radio\" slogans and jingles as part of an April Fools' Day joke.\n\nKLSX was owned by Greater Media until 1997, when Greater Media swapped KLSX and sister station KRLA for three stations: WMMR in Philadelphia and WBOS and WOAZ in Boston. The deal enabled Greater Media to operate larger clusters in these two markets while exiting Los Angeles. The swap led KLSX into the ownership of CBS Radio, where it joined radio stations KTWV and KCBS-FM.\n\nFrom 1995 until its acquisition by CBS in 1997, KLSX played alternative music on weekends. Instead of competing with its now-sister station, established modern rock outlet KROQ-FM, it was asked to switch to triple-A, a blend of album rock and alternative music that appealed to a 35-and-up age demographic). That format continued on weekends until 1999, when the talk format was expanded to weekends, leaving Sunday morning's \"Breakfast with the Beatles\" as the only program that played music. During that era and prior to being sold, KLSX boasted the only late-night talk shows in Los Angeles featuring women as hosts: \"Dr. X\" and subsequently a short-run of \"Shrink Rap\". KLSX was also the local home of the syndicated novelty music program \"Dr. Demento\".\n\nKLSX was the Los Angeles-area radio home of the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League. Previously, the station aired games from the Jones Radio Network's Sports USA service and \"NFL on Westwood One Sports\". In 2001, it carried the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL. KLSX has also aired a sports year-in-review show from Westwood One.\n\nA number of changes came to KLSX in 2005. On October 25, it was announced that Adam Carolla would take over as the station's morning show host in January 2006 due to Howard Stern's departure to satellite radio. On that same day, the station also became known on-air as \"97.1 Free FM\"—so-called to highlight that its stations broadcast free-to-air, funded by commercials, whereas satellite radio requires a subscription fee. In addition to KLSX, CBS Radio introduced its Free FM branding on KSCF in San Diego, KIFR in San Francisco, and other hot talk-formatted outlets. Those three California stations carried \"The Tom Leykis Show\" and \"The John and Jeff Show\". Locally, Tim Conway Jr. and comedy writer Doug Steckler co-hosted the evening show (\"The Conway and Steckler Show\") until June 2005, when Steckler's contract was not renewed. Funnyman/impressionist Brian Whitman was brought in as Steckler's replacement, and the show was renamed \"The Conway and Whitman Show\". \"The Frosty, Heidi, and Frank Show\" was picked up and, until January 2007, was syndicated to KSCF.\n\nIn 2007, KLSX added Danny Bonaduce to The Adam Carolla Show (replacing sportscaster Dave Dameshek). In 2008, he was given his own (local) one-hour show following \"Frosty, Heidi & Frank\", in a timeslot that had been vacant since the departure of entertainment reporter Sam Rubin in 2003. Also in 2008, Brian Whitman unexpectedly left the station in March. Tim Conway, Jr. ended up hosting the evening show alone. Arsenio Hall was a semi-regular guest host with Tim on the \"Tim Conway Jr.\" show on Wednesday nights in 2008–09.\n\nKLSX was the last station to use the Free FM branding, having abandoned the moniker in early October 2008, signaling the official desertion of the brand nationally by CBS Radio. The program director for KLSX at this time was Jack Silver. The assistant program director and creative voice of the station was Rich Boerner, who also programmed the weekend music formats.\n\nIn early 2009, speculation arose on whether KLSX would be switching formats. On February 17, information started to emerge that KLSX was to drop hot talk on February 20 and flip to a top 40 format aimed at younger listeners, taking the \"AMP\" format that was created by KROQ-FM program director Kevin Weatherly and APD John Michael on KCBS-HD2.\n\nThe station's main line up of \"The Adam Carolla Show\", \"Frosty, Heidi & Frank\", Danny Bonaduce (in a solo spot known as \"Broadcasting Bonaduce\"), \"The Tom Leykis Show\", \"The Tim Conway Jr. Show\" and \"The John and Jeff Show\" were all given advance notice of the format shift and afforded the opportunity to host final shows to explain the situation and say their goodbyes. \"97.1 FM Talk\" ended on February 20 at 5 p.m. (Pacific time), giving longtime radio veteran Tom Leykis the final sign-off and the opportunity to \"blow up\" the station (in reference to a catchphrase used by the show's callers, \"Blow me up, Tom!\").\n\n\"AMP Radio\" then launched with \"Paranoid\" by Kanye West (which coincidentally was also playing on its new rival KIIS-FM at the same time), beginning a commercial-free block of 10,000 songs, similar to the debuts of the current KDAY in 2004 and, in 1989, KQLZ (Pirate Radio). The launch of \"AMP\" marked the first top 40 radio battle in Los Angeles since KPWR switched to a hip hop-heavy rhythmic contemporary format in 1994. On June 30, 2009, the station changed its callsign to KAMP to go with the current format, and changed again on July 7, 2009 to KAMP-FM in order to avoid confusion with KAMP (AM), an unlicensed student-run radio station at the University of Arizona.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, KAMP rounded out their on-air lineup, which featured Carson Daly in mornings, Chris Booker middays, Ted Stryker afternoons, and Casey McCabe at night. CBS Radio would later expand the \"AMP Radio\" brand to Detroit (WDZH), Boston (WODS), Orlando (WQMP), New York City (WNYL), Philadelphia (WTDY-FM), and Dallas (KVIL). As of 2020, all radio stations flipped to different formats, although the Philadelphia outlet had since returned to the top 40 format under a different moniker.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Carson Daly left the station. The morning drive timeslot remained open until February 2018, when the station introduced a new morning show hosted by former WBMP New York morning host Edgar \"Shoboy\" Sotelo, former WWWQ Atlanta morning show co-host and comedian Brian Moote, and Billboard news correspondent Chelsea Briggs. Moote left the station in July 2019, while Sotelo left in October 2019. The departures would result in the on-air lineup being revised, making Booker move from afternoons to mornings, and adding former KPWR morning co-host Krystal Bianca to mornings, Christen Limon to middays, and Yesi Ortiz to afternoons, while McCabe remains as night host. Booker left the station on April 3, 2020.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, KAMP-FM dropped \"Radio\" from their moniker and re-branded as \"97.1 AMP\".\n\nKAMP-FM broadcasts in HD Radio with three digital subchannels.\n\n\nOn January 8, 2018, Entercom entered a deal to bring the New York City-based dance/EDM webcast Pulse 87 to the Los Angeles airwaves as a HD2 subchannel of KAMP-FM, billing it as \"Pulse 97.1 HD2\". The subchannel replaced the simulcast of KNX, which moved over to the HD2 subchannel of KCBS-FM.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, KAMP-HD2 dropped Pulse 87 to make room for the newly launched \"Out Now Radio\", an talk/EDM format targeted to the LGBTQ community. Many of the hosts on Out Now Radio were based at Entercom's Los Angeles studios. On November 1, 2018, Out Now Radio rebranded as \"Channel Q\".\n\nOn March 14, 2019, KAMP-FM launched an HD3 subchannel with a nonstop dance/EDM mixshow format, billed as \"Fire Lane\". The music and presentation is similar to Pulse 87's format. Entercom expanded the brand to its Radio.com platform on August 5, 2019.\n\nAMP Radio currently ranks at #11 (2.9 share) in the Los Angeles market according to the February 2018 PPM Ratings release.\n\n"}
{"id": "2152061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152061", "title": "Scatterometer", "text": "Scatterometer\n\nA scatterometer or diffusionmeter is a scientific instrument to measure the return of a beam of light or radar waves scattered by diffusion in a medium such as air. Diffusionmeters using visible light are found in airports or along roads to measure horizontal visibility. Radar scatterometers use radio or microwaves to determine the normalized radar cross section (σ, \"sigma zero\" or \"sigma naught\") of a surface. They are often mounted on weather satellites to find wind speed and direction, and are used in industries to analyze the roughness of surfaces.\n\nOptical diffusionmeters are devices used in meteorology to find the optical range or the horizontal visibility. They consist of a light source, usually a laser, and a receiver. Both are placed at a 35° angle downward, aimed at a common area. Lateral scattering by the air along the light beam is quantified as an attenuation coefficient. Any departure from the clear air extinction coefficient (e.g. in fog) is measured and is inversely proportional to the visibility (the greater the loss, the lower is the visibility).\n\nThese devices are found in automatic weather stations for general visibility, along airport runways for runway visual range, or along roads for visual conditions. Their main drawback is that the measurement is done over the very small volume of air between the transmitter and the receiver. The visibility reported is therefore only representative of the general conditions around the instrument in generalized conditions (synoptic fog for instance). This is not always the case (e.g. patchy fog).\n\nA radar scatterometer operates by transmitting a pulse of microwave energy towards the Earth's surface and measuring the reflected energy. A separate measurement of the noise-only power is made and subtracted from the signal+noise measurement to determine the backscatter signal power. Sigma-0 (σ⁰) is computed from the signal power measurement using the distributed target radar equation. Scatterometer instruments are very precisely calibrated in order to make accurate backscatter measurements.\n\nThe primary application of spaceborne scatterometry has been measurements of near-surface winds over the ocean. Such instruments are known as wind scatterometers. By combining sigma-0 measurements from different azimuth angles, the near-surface wind vector over the ocean's surface can be determined using a geophysical model function (GMF) which relates wind and backscatter. Over the ocean, the radar backscatter results from scattering from wind-generated capillary-gravity waves, which are generally in equilibrium with the near-surface wind over the ocean. The scattering mechanism is known as Bragg scattering, which occurs from the waves that are in resonance with the microwaves.\n\nThe backscattered power depends on the wind speed and direction. Viewed from different azimuth angles, the observed backscatter from these waves varies. These variations can be exploited to estimate the sea surface wind, i.e. its speed and direction. This estimate process is sometimes termed 'wind retrieval' or 'model function inversion'. This is a non-linear inversion procedure based on an accurate knowledge of the GMF (in an empirical or semi-empirical form) that relates the scatterometer backscatter and the vector wind. Retrieval requires an angular diversity scatterometer measurements with the GMF, which is provided by the scatterometer making several backscatter measurements of the same spot on the ocean's surface from different azimuth angles.\n\nScatterometer wind measurements are used for air-sea interaction, climate studies and are particularly useful for monitoring hurricanes. Scatterometer backscatter data are applied to the study of vegetation, soil moisture, polar ice, tracking Antarctic icebergs and global change. Scatterometer measurements have been used to measure winds over sand and snow dunes from space. Non-terrestrial applications include study of Solar System moons using space probes. This is especially the case with the NASA/ESA Cassini mission to Saturn and its moons.\n\nSeveral generations of wind scatterometers have been flown in space by NASA, ESA, and NASDA. The first operational wind scatterometer was known as the Seasat Scatterometer (SASS) and was launched in 1978. It was a fan-beam system operating at Ku-band (14 GHz). In 1991 ESA launched the European Remote-Sensing Satellite ERS-1 Advanced Microwave Instrument (AMI) scatterometer, followed by the ERS-2 AMI scatterometer in 1995. Both AMI fan-beam systems operated at C-band (5.6 GHz). In 1996 NASA launched the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), a Ku-band fan-beam system. NASA launched the first scanning scatterometer, known as 'SeaWinds', on QuikSCAT in 1999. It operated at Ku-band. A second SeaWinds instrument was flown on the NASDA ADEOS-2 in 2002. The Indian Space Research Organisation launched a Ku-band scatterometer on their Oceansat-2 platform in 2009. ESA and EUMETSAT launched the first C-band ASCAT in 2006 onboard Metop-A. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), launched in 2016, is a constellation of eight small satellites utilizing a bistatic approach by analyzing the reflection from the Earth's surface of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, rather than using an onboard radar transmitter.\n\nScatterometers helped to prove the hypothesis, dating from mid-19th century, of the anisotropic (direction dependent) long distance dispersion by wind to explain the strong floristic affinities between landmasses.\n\nA work, published by the journal \"Science\" in May 2004 with the title \"Wind as a Long-Distance Dispersal Vehicle in the Southern Hemisphere\", used daily measurements of wind azimuth and speed taken by the SeaWinds scatterometer from 1999 to 2003.

The original ranch was established in 1862 by a Canadian fur trader, Johnny Grant, at Cottonwood Creek, Montana (future site of Deer Lodge, Montana), along the banks of the Clark Fork river. The ranch was later expanded by a cattle baron, Conrad Kohrs (1866–1920). The historic site (originally designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960) is maintained today as a working ranch by the National Park Service.\n\nJohnny Francis Grant was born at Fort Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. His mother died when he was only three years old, so he was sent to Trois-Rivières, Quebec, to be raised by his grandmother. His father, Captain Richard Grant, was a Hudson's Bay Company employee, and therefore, in his mid-teens, he left for Fort Hall, Idaho, to meet up with his father. There he learned the trading business. However, in the 1840s the fur trade was dying out, so Johnny Grant and his brother James turned to trading with emigrants traveling west along the Oregon Trail. He made a considerable profit by trading travelers one healthy cow or horse for two trail-wearied ones. He then fed and rested the tired animals and the following season traded them again. This is how he got into the cattle business.\n\nGrant started using the Deer Lodge Valley in 1857 to graze his cattle during the winter along the banks of the Clark Fork river near Cottonwood creek. In 1859 he decided to permanently locate a ranch and constructed a permanent residence in 1862. He convinced traders to settle around him, forming the town of Cottonwood (later to become Deer Lodge). Johnny was initially successful, but found that when gold miners arrived in the area, he was at a disadvantage, because he spoke French and the newcomers spoke English. He was taken advantage of in contracts and felt that he could no longer be successful in the area. In August 1866, he sold his ranch to a cattle baron, Conrad Kohrs, for $19,200 and returned to Canada.\n\nConrad Kohrs was born on August 5, 1835, in Wewelsfleth, in Holstein province, which was then a part of the German Confederation. At the age of 22, he became a citizen of the United States. He went to California during the gold rush days. He then moved on to Canada and arrived at the gold camps of Montana in 1862. He never struck gold, but he became wealthy by selling beef to the miners. Kohrs built his cattle operation until he owned 50,000 head of cattle and had grazing pasture of 10 million acres (40,000 km2). However, he had a setback when the severe winter of 1886–1887 left over half the cattle population in the northwest dead. Most cattlemen went bankrupt, but Kohrs managed to receive a 100,000 dollar loan from his banker, A. J. Davis. While the open range era was ending, Kohrs adapted successfully and was able to pay off the loan in only four years.\n\nKohrs and his half-brother, John Bielenberg, turned to more modern methods of ranching, including buying purebred breeding stock, fencing his rangeland and raising and storing fodder. His became known as \"Montana's Cattle King.\" Bielenberg helped Kohrs to run the Grant–Kohrs ranch. He originally came to Montana at age 18 in 1864 to help with the butcher shop that served the mining camps. Bielenberg had a lot to do with the horse side of the Grant–Kohrs ranch. He bred what were called the \"Big Circle\" horses, reputed to be able to cover twenty miles of country in a half a day; a trait useful when gathering cattle spread over a very large area. Together, Bielenberg and Kohrs made a most successful team for over half a century.\n\nThe winter of 1886–1887 was one of the harshest on record in Montana. Ranchers using the open range for their herds lost upwards of 90% of their cattle to brutal cold and lack of feed. In Eastern Montana, temperatures hovered at 30–40 degrees below zero for weeks on end. The summer of 1887 witnesses a great many ranchers in Montana go out of business.\n\nIn the 1960s, the National Park Service, under the leadership of Director Conrad Wirth, reenergized the search for historic properties under the auspices of the Historic Sites Act of 1935 and Mission 66. The original Grant–Kohrs ranch was among several other ranches which were recommended for National Historic Landmark status. Con Warren wanted to sell the Grant–Kohrs portion of his ranch to the National Park Service as a historic landmark. In 1970 an agreement to sell the property to the park service was achieved with the proviso that it would be \"managed as a living ranch\" by the National Park Service. The original purchase involved of the active Warren Hereford Ranch. In December 1970, the National Park Foundation acquired an additional of the ranch allowing the National Park Service to take administrative control of the site.\n\nIn August 1972, the U.S. Congress authorized the establishment of Grant–Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site \"to provide an understanding of the frontier cattle era of the Nation’s history, to preserve the Grant–Kohrs Ranch, and to interpret the nationally significant values thereof for the benefit and inspiration of future generations.\" In 1972 the National Park Foundation transferred ownership of its portions of the site to the National Park Service. Initially the site was administered under the jurisdiction of Yellowstone National Park. In 1972 the Grant–Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, the National Park Service continued to acquire acreage from Conrad Warren, rehabilitate elements of the ranch and provide improvements for visitation to include a visitor center, interpretive trails and access for the public. In 1974 the site became an independently operating unit of the National Park Service with its own superintendent, historian and budget. A formal dedication ceremony was held on July 17, 1977, and visitors were admitted to the new site.,\n\nThe Grant–Kohrs National Historic Site today is operated by the National Park Service. It is a major tourist attraction in Deer Lodge, Montana, and the tour is free. The National Park Service runs it as a living history ranch, using draft horse teams to hay the land, and blacksmiths on site make horseshoes for the horses. They keep all operations as close to how they would be in the 19th century as possible.\n\n\n\n"}

The Act eventually transferred from public to private ownership.\n\nThe national monument is five miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, Nebraska on a site that includes some of the first acres successfully claimed under the Homestead Act. The national monument was first included in the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966 (ID 66000115).\n\nThe Homestead Heritage Center, dedicated in 2007, contains exhibits that treat the effect of the Homestead Act on immigration, agriculture, native tribes, the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, and federal land policy. The roof line of the center resembles a \"single bottom plow moving through the sod,\" and the parking lot measures exactly . A separate Education Center features science and social science presentations that can be shared with classrooms anywhere in the United States through distance-learning.\n\nThe park includes of tallgrass prairie restored to approximate the ecosystem that once covered the central plains of the United States—and that was nearly plowed into extinction by the homesteaders. This restoration, which necessitates regular mowing, haying, and prescribed burns, has been managed by the National Park Service for more than 60 years and is the oldest in the National Park System. The park maintains about of hiking trails through the prairie and the woodland surrounding Cub Creek, accessible via all-terrain wheelchair.\n\nIn 1867, George W. Palmer built the Palmer-Epard Cabin from mixed hardwoods about 14 miles northeast of the Monument. It measures 14 x 16 feet and is representative of the local construction style. Palmer lived in the cabin with his wife and 10 children. Between 1875 and 1880, a 10 x 12 foot lean-to was added to the rear of the cabin, and the Palmers continued to live in it until 1895, when it was sold to nephews Eugene Mumford and William Foreman. A few years later, the farm was sold to Lawrence and Ida Mumford Epard, who lived in the cabin for nearly 40 years. The cabin was donated to the park in 1950 and has been moved and restored several times in intervening years.\n\nThe Freeman School, built of foot-thick red brick with carved limestone lintels, was the longest continuously used one-room school in Nebraska (1872–1967). The school also served as a Lutheran church, a polling place for Blakely Township, and a community center for debates, clubs, and box socials. The National Park Service restored the school to appear as it did during the 1870s.\n\nThe Freeman School was the focus of an early, influential judicial decision regarding separation of church and state. In 1899, Daniel Freeman sued the school board after a teacher, Edith Beecher, refused to stop praying, reading the Bible, and singing gospel songs in her classroom. In \"Freeman v. Scheve, et al.\" (1902), the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that Beecher's activities violated provisions of the Nebraska constitution.\n\nDaniel Freeman (1826–1908), a native of Ohio, filed the first homestead claim in the Brownville, Nebraska land office on January 1, 1863. By the mid-1880s, Freeman also claimed to have been the first homesteader in the nation. Freeman eventually amassed more than and became a prominent citizen of Gage County. As early as 1884, he first proposed the idea of memorializing himself as the earliest homesteader, and shortly after his death in 1908, Beatrice residents talked of preserving his homestead as a national park.\n\nProposals to create such a park were rejected until during the mid-1920s, the influential Senator George W. Norris suggested a historical museum of agricultural implements be established on the Freeman property and the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a marker there.\n\nIn 1934, Beatrice citizens organized the National Homestead Park Association, reinvigorating the movement. In 1935, Norris and newly elected congressman Henry C. Luckey of Lincoln introduced legislation to create the park, which eventually became law in March 1936. But federal funding for the purchase was not obtained until March 1938. Negotiations with the Freeman heirs \"dragged on for months over the value of the land,\" and condemnation proceedings were instigated to bring them to terms. The government took possession at the end of the year.\n\nA few improvements were made to the site before American entrance into World War II effectively ended both visitation and development. In the 1950s, the National Park Service acquired the Palmer-Epard cabin and built a visitor center as part of its Mission 66 program. A small museum there exhibited some of the artifacts donated to the park by the Gage County Historical Society in 1948. By 1981 the national monument had five permanent employees, one part-time employee, and some seasonal personnel.\n\nIn the 1970s and '80s, seasonal rangers presented living history demonstrations, although many of their activities were later viewed as \"not historically accurate for the homestead era\" and \"more reminiscent of the Appalachian hill country than prairie homesteads.\" By the 1990s, the NPS had limited funding for such interpretation, and the monument began to extend the story of the Homestead Act to other regions of the country. Under Superintendent Mark Engler, a Beatrice native, the national monument dedicated the Homestead Heritage Center in 2007 with more interactive displays that treated the Homestead Act from a broader prospective, a change symbolized in part by a \"Living Wall\" at its entrance with a physical representation of the percentage of land successfully homesteaded in each state.\n\n"}

It is considered a meeting ground of two cultures between the Navajo and the settlers who came to the area to trade.\n\nIn 1878, John Lorenzo Hubbell purchased this trading post, ten years after Navajos were allowed to return to the Ganado region from their U.S.-imposed exile in Bosque Redondo, Fort Sumner, New Mexico. This ended what is known in Navajo history as the \"Long Walk of the Navajo.\"\n\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n\nWhen the Navajos returned from The Long Walk in 1868, they found their herds decimated, their fields destroyed. Their way of life was ripped apart and their life was forever changed. The Navajos were troubled by an economic depression in the late 19th century as a result of the Long Walk. Thus, trade became increasingly important.\n\nHeavy sandstones from the area were quarried in 1883 to begin construction of this solid building along the southern banks of the Pueblo Colorado Wash. Life at Hubbell Trading Post centered around it. The idea of trading was not new to the Navajos. Native American tribes in the Southwest had traded amongst themselves for centuries. During the four years' internment at Bosque Redondo, Navajos were introduced to many new items (e.g., flour, sugar, coffee, baking powder, canned goods, tobacco, tools, cloth, etc.). When the Anglos came to trade with the Navajos, the difference was in the products exchanged, and in the changes brought about by these exchanges. Traders like Hubbell supplied these items.\n\nTrade with men like Hubbell became increasingly important for the Navajos. The trader was in contact with the world outside the newly created reservation; a world which could supply the staples the Navajos needed to supplement their homegrown products. In exchange for the trader's goods the Navajos traded wool, sheep and, later, rugs, jewelry, baskets and pottery. It was years before cash was used between trader and Navajos.\n\nHubbell family members operated this trading post until it was sold to the National Park Service in 1967. The trading post is still active, operated by the non-profit Western National Parks Association, which maintains the trading traditions the Hubbell family established.\n\nToday, Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site is still situated on the original homestead, which includes the trading post, family home, out buildings, land and a visitors center. Visitors can experience this historic trading post on the Navajo Nation, which includes weaving demonstrations; and the store still maintains a wooden floor and walls from the days of old. A set of initials carved on the gate of the privacy wall which separates the public spaces from the private stand for John Lorenzo Hubbell.\n\nHubbell's father was Anglo, his mother Spanish. He was raised in Pajarito Mesa, New Mexico, a small village just south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. He came to this area in 1876, less than ten years after the Long Walk. In 1878 he bought the small buildings comprising the compound from a trader named William Leonard, and started business. He was twenty-three years old, single and trying to make a living among the Navajos, a people he did not know very well. He had to find a niche in a new culture, a difficult language. He probably learned \"trader Navajo\" very quickly. John Lorenzo was trilingual. He spoke English, Spanish and Navajo.\n\nMr. Hubbell married a Spanish woman named Lina Rubi. They had two sons and two daughters. Additions to the family home to accommodate the growing family were finished in 1902. It started out as a plain adobe building which the Hubbell family gradually made into a comfortable, and in some ways, luxurious home. Paintings and artifacts and many large Navajo rugs still decorate the interior. Unlike other traders who left their families \"back home\" in the east, the entire Hubbell family spent most of the year in the village of Ganado. The Hubbells lived in the house until 1967.\n\nThe guest house was built in the early 1930s by Roman and Dorothy Hubbell, Mr. Hubbell's son and daughter-in-law, as a tribute to Mr. Hubbell. Dorothy Hubbell carved the inner wooden door. Visitors stayed in the Hubbell home, such as artists who were interested in the color and shapes of the land; anthropologists who came to Mr. Hubbell for information; statesmen; friends of the family; and ordinary travelers in need of a place to stay. Architecturally, the guest house is in the Hogan (pronounced hoe-gone) (Navajo for home) style. Most hogans are built of logs, and the door always faces the east. Hogans are one-room dwellings and usually have six or eight sides. Mr. Hubbell built several traditional hogans on the grounds for the Navajos who came long distances to trade. The guest house was originally called Pueblo Colorado (the inscription over the door) but often was confused with the town of Pueblo, Colorado. There was an important Navajo leader named totsohnii Hastiin (pronounced Toe-so-knee haaus-teen) (Navajo for \"man of the big water clan\"). He was also called Ganado Mucho (pronounced gah-nah-doe-moo-cho) (Spanish for \"many cattle\") and Mr. Hubbell renamed this place Ganado for him. Ganado Mucho had a son, Many Horses, who is buried on the property.\n\nBeyond the perimeter wall to the north courses the Pueblo Colorado Wash, the northern boundary of the Hubbell settlement. In some sections of the Ganado-Cornfields valley, the wash is spring-fed and runs year round. Melting snows in spring and heavy summer rains sometimes cause it to flood. In the Southwest a good source of water has always attracted people. The Anasazi (pronounced Ah-na-eeh-son-ni) (Navajo for \"the ancient ones\") lived in small villages up and down the valley hundreds of years ago. The Navajos came later, and then the traders - all attracted to the source of water.\n\nThe cone-shaped hill located northwest of the trading post is Hubbell Hill. The family cemetery is at the top. Mr. Hubbell, his wife, three of his children, a daughter-in-law, a granddaughter, and a Navajo man named Many Horses are buried there. Many Horses was one of the local herdsmen and the son of Ganado Mucho. He and Mr. Hubbell were close friends for many years. Mr. Hubbell maintained a friendship with many of his customers until his death in 1930. Then his younger son Roman operated the business. When Roman died in 1957, his wife Dorothy managed the store for another ten years, until 1967 when the National Park Service acquired the site.\n\nBuilt with juniper logs upright in the ground, the corrals of the trading post held lambs and sheep purchased from Navajo stockmen by Mr. Hubbell. The flocks stayed in the corral complex until they could be herded to the railroad. From time to time Mr. Hubbell kept beef cattle as well. Mr. Hubbell homesteaded before they were part of the reservation and territory. When the reservation expanded, it surrounded the Hubbell property. Through an act of Congress Mr. Hubbell got permission to keep his home. Freight wagons brought supplies fifty-six miles to the store from the little railroad town of Gallup, New Mexico, two to four days' travel in good weather. Going back to Gallup, freight wagons hauled huge sacks of wool.\n\nConstruction of the trading post barn began in 1897. The builders, local people, made the walls of local sandstone and the roofs fashioned in the ancient Anasazi-style dwellings. Ponderosa pine beams, aspen poles, juniper bark, cornstalks, and dirt make up layers, each at right angles to the one below it. Mules and pulleys lifted the beams into place. The timbers came from about twelve miles (19 km) east of Ganado Village where it is high enough for Ponderosa to grow. The aspen poles came from farther away in the Chuska Mountains that straddle the Arizona/New Mexico state line one hundred miles north to the intersection with Colorado and Utah. The barn was completed in 1900.\n\n\n\n"}

The goal of the 1775–1776 trip was to establish a mission and presidio on the San Francisco Bay. The trail was an attempt to ease the course of Spanish colonization of California by establishing a major land route north for many to follow. It was used for about five years before being closed by the Quechan (Yuma) Indians in 1781 and kept closed for the next 40 years.\n\nJuan Bautista de Anza leading an exploratory expedition on January 8, 1774, with 3 padres, 20 soldiers, 11 servants, 35 mules, 65 cattle, and 140 horses set forth from Tubac Presidio, south of present-day Tucson, Arizona.

The friendly Quechan (Yuma) Indians (2,000-3,000) they encountered there were growing most of their food using irrigation systems and had already imported pottery, horses, wheat and a few other crops from New Mexico. After crossing the Colorado to avoid the impassable Algodones Dunes, they followed the river about to approximately Arizona's southwest corner on the Colorado River. There Anza turned westward following along a seasonal dis-tributary river of the Colorado until it turned northwest near present-day Mexicali, Mexico and then turned north through present-day Imperial Valley. Anza then turned northwest again crossing the remaining desert and mountains before reaching the coastal valleys of Southern California and the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel near the future city of Los Angeles, California. The Pueblo de Los Angeles would be established in 1781 by eleven families recruited mostly from Sonora y Sinaloa Province. It took Anza about 74 days to make this initial reconnaissance trip to establish a land route into California.\n\nOn his return trip he retraced his path to the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River and then went down the Gila River corridor until reaching the Santa Cruz River (Arizona) corridor and continuing on to Tubac, Arizona. The return trip only took 23 days as he now had found a trail with sufficient water to make land access to California possible. On the Gila River, he encountered several extensive villages of Pima (Akimel O'odham) Indians. These were a peaceful and populous agricultural tribe with extensive crops and irrigation systems located along the river.\nIn Anza's second trip (1775–1776) he returned to California via the Gila River path he had discovered with 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They took 695 horses and mules, 385 Texas Longhorn bulls and cows with them—starting the cattle and horse industry in California. In California, the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years and essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals, doubling roughly every two years. They started from Tubac Arizona on October 22, 1775 and arrived at San Francisco Bay on March 28, 1776. There they established the Presidio of San Francisco, followed by Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores) – the future city of San Francisco, California.\n\nIn 1779, Father Francisco Garcés was assigned to establish a mission at Yuma crossing of the Colorado River. In 1780, the Spanish established two combination missions and pueblos at the Yuma Colorado River Crossing of the Anza trail: Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuñer and Mission Puerto de Purísima Concepción. Both these pueblos and missions were on the California side of the Colorado River near the mouth of the Gila River but were administered by the Arizona authorities.\n\nThe settlement of Los Angeles, California involved two groups totaling 44 persons including 22 children. One group under Alfèrez Ramon Laso de la Vega crossed the Gulf of California on launches and then travelled overland to San Diego and up to the San Gabriel Mission.\n\nThe second group, under Fernando Rivera y Moncada, took an overland route over the Anza trail through the desert from Sinaloa Mexico. They passed through the new missions on the Colorado River, Mission Puerto de Purísima Concepción and Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuñer. The group arrived at the Colorado River in June 1781. Rivera y Moncada sent most of his party ahead, but he stayed behind to rest the livestock before continuing their drive across the desert. His party would never reach San Gabriel. In July, Rivera was killed along with the local missionaries, settlers, and travelers with the revolt of the Quechan Indians (Yuma Revolt) in 1781.\n\nThe Quechan and Mojave Indians rose up against the party for encroaching on their farmlands and for other abuses inflicted by the soldiers. On July 17-19, 1781, the Yuma (Quechan) Indians, in a dispute with the New Spain government and church, destroyed both missions and pueblos – killing 103 soldiers, colonists and Friars and capturing about 80 more (mostly women and children). Included in the casualties were Fernando Rivera y Moncada military commander and former governor of California and Father Francisco Garcés founder of the missions on the Colorado River. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The Yuma Crossing and the Anza trail were closed for Spanish traffic and would stay closed until the late 1820s. As a result, California was nearly isolated again from land-based travel, and about the only way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea. According to historian David Weber, the Yuma revolt turned California into an \"island\" and Arizona into a \"cul de sac\", severing Arizona-California and Mexican land connections before they could be firmly established.\n\nAlong the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail route, visitors can experience the varied landscapes similar to those the expedition saw; learn the stories of the expedition's events, members, and descendants; better understand the Native American diversity of cultures in their homelands and their guidance on the expedition; and appreciate the extent and lasting influences of Spanish colonial settlements in present-day Arizona and California. The Trail was designated a National Historic Trail in 1990 and a National Millennium Trail in 1999.\n\nIn 2005, Caltrans began posting signs on roads that overlap with the trail route so that California drivers could follow the trail.\n\nThe National Park Service has developed a printed and online: Brochure Map for driving and guides for auto tours, hiking sections, and designated Historic sites, landmarks, and museums open to the public. Schedules of Anza celebrations and other historic events are on an updated NPS: What to Do-Events Guide. The detailed Anza Trail Maps by County show more points of interest, trailheads, and local lore.\n\nThe Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail \"project\" is growing as local, state, and NPS efforts establish more trails, signage, and interpretive programs. The Trail is inspiring activities at existing municipal parks, neighborhood greenbelts, regional parks, and large open space preserves. Such opportunities can be discovered and tracked at the official Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail website.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2152105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152105", "title": "Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site", "text": "Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site\n\nThe Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, which was established in 1974, preserves the historic and archaeological remnants of bands of Hidatsa, Northern Plains Indians. This area was a major trading and agricultural area. Three villages were known to occupy the Knife area. In general, these three villages are known as Hidatsa villages. Broken down, the individual villages are \"Awatixa Xi'e\" (lower Hidatsa village), \"Awatixa\" and Big Hidatsa village. Awatixa Xi'e is believed to be the oldest village of the three. The Big Hidatsa village was established around 1600.\n\nThe Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site is located in central North Dakota, at the confluence of the Knife River with the Missouri River. The village is located ½ mile north of present-day Stanton, North Dakota, 1 hour north west of Bismarck, and 1 ½ hours south west of Minot, North Dakota. The Knife River is a tributary to the Missouri River. Scenic sights such as broad plains, river bluffs, and river bottom forests can all be seen along the two rivers. The national park borders both sides of the Knife River, and is made up of a forested peninsula along the length of the river.\n\nThe Missouri River is known as the \"Big Muddy\" due to its high sedimentation loads. The Missouri River drains approximately one-sixth of the United States and its basin encompasses . During the pre-development period, the Missouri River represented one of North America's most diverse ecosystems.\n\nAt the Knife River Indian Villages National Historical Site, there are the visible remains of earth-lodge dwellings, cache pits, and travois trails. The remains of the earth-lodge dwellings can be seen as large circular depressions in the ground. These dwellings were as large as in diameter. Many were once large enough to house up to 20 families, a few horses, and dogs. The dwellings were constructed at ground level. As the dwellings were abandoned, the walls and roof collapsed and created the visible outer circular rim.\n\nSakakawea (Sacagawea) lived in one of the villages of the Knife River. The presence of Sakakawea and her son on the Lewis and Clark expedition was extremely crucial to the safety of the party and the success of their mission. In addition to her ability to translate for them, tribes who encountered the party believed that the presence of the young woman and child indicated they were not a threat. This is due to the fact that war parties did not allow women and children to accompany them.\n\nThe Knife River Villages served as an important major central trading and agricultural area. The Native Americans served as middlemen in a trading area that stretched from Minnesota, to the Great Plains and Gulf Coast, and the Northwest Pacific Coast. Their trading business largely consisted of furs, guns, and metals such as copper, but the Hidatsa and Mandan traded corn and other agricultural products.\n\nThe Knife River villages thrived until 1837, when a series of smallpox outbreaks nearly wiped out the population; they suffered a 50% loss in population. Gradually survivors of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara villages migrated north and developed the village of Like-a-Fishhook.\n\nThe smallpox outbreaks from 1837–1840 had a 90% death rate among the Mandan. The two Mandan villages that had been in contact with Lewis and Clark suffered the horrific effects of the virus. The smallpox outbreak lasted from 1837–1838 and, out of 1,600 Mandan villagers, 31 survived. The smallpox epidemic was largely spread through the trading business. Despite warnings of outbreaks, Native Americans still visited trading posts and became exposed to the virus. Once the infected Mandan villages were empty, neighboring peoples raided the village for goods, but suffered after carrying back the virus via blankets, horses, and household tools.\n\nOver the hundreds of years that the Native Americans occupied this area, a very different landscape existed than what can be observed today. When occupied by the tribes, the upland areas were a mixed prairie region that contained a minimal number of trees. The floodplain forests in the river bottomlands were rich and fertile. This fertile area was cleared and used by the Native Americans in the cultivation of such crops as corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. Trees such as green ash, cottonwood, American elm, and box elder were common in the bottomlands. Other smaller trees and shrubs such as sandbar willow, red osier dogwood, and buffalo berry were also common.\n\nIn 1974, as an effort to preserve the historic value and beauty as it once appeared, the area surrounding the park was transformed back to how it originally looked when the Native Americans occupied the area. The area now contains native short grass prairies, exotic grasslands, of hardwood forest, cultural village sites, wetland areas and sandbars.\n\nWithin some areas of the park, the forest composition has changed very little. A few prairie areas contain wheatgrass, needlegrass, grama, and big bluestem grasses and many forbs and flowers. Native wildlife feed on plants such as choke cherry, wild plums, buffaloberry and Juneberry.\n\nThe various vegetative communities within the park are home to many species of wildlife. The surrounding forests are home to white tailed deer, coyotes, beavers, skunks, prairie pocket gophers and thirteen-lined ground squirrels. The park is also home to a large variety of birds. Game birds found here include turkeys, pheasants, Canada geese and mourning doves. Raptors such as owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles and kestrels can be spotted. Other birds surrounding the rivers that can be viewed here are white pelicans, snow geese, and great blue herons. The Missouri and the Knife Rivers are home to twenty–six known species of aquatic mollusks within the park.\n\nWithin the park limits, insect species are being collected and analyzed. Over 200 different species of invertebrates have been identified. The most common order of insects found here include Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), Hemiptera (true bugs) Homoptera (leaf hoppers), and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants). Many of these insects are crucial to the diet of park wildlife.\n\nAs with everywhere else, the park struggles with the management of exotic invasive species. Exotic plants first appeared when Native Americans and Euro-Americans cleared the forests. Many exotic plants are introduced accidentally but a few were planted deliberately. Exotic plant species include leafy spurge, Canada thistle and sweet clover. The park is currently conducting an inventory and monitoring program to gather information on the plant and animal species present within the park. From this information, the managers will be able to best decide how to manage and control the exotic invasive plants.\n\nDuring the summer months, the temperature may reach the upper 80's with relatively low humidity and variable winds. The annual average temperature is . The winter months may bring below-zero temperatures. This area receives approximately of precipitation a year.\n\n1. \"Climate of North Dakota.\" Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center. 3 August 2006.

It is part of the National Trails System of the United States. It extends for some from Wood River, Illinois, to the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon.\n\nThe trail is administered by the National Park Service, but sites along the trail are managed by federal land management agencies, state, local, tribal, and private organizations. The trail is not a hiking trail, but provides opportunities for hiking, boating and horseback riding at many locations along the route. The trail is the second longest of the 23 National Scenic and National Historic Trails. Beginning at the Camp Dubois recreation in Illinois, it passes through portions of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.\n\nThe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail is approximately long, extending from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the mouth of the Columbia River, near present day Astoria, Oregon. It follows the historic outbound and inbound routes of the Lewis and Clark Expedition as well as the preparatory section from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Wood River, Illinois. The Trail connects 16 states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon) and many tribal lands. It is administered by the National Park Service.\n\nThe official headquarters for the trail is located at the National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters, in Omaha, Nebraska. The visitor center features exhibits about the explorers and their historic trip, as well as information about sites along the trail.\n\nIn 1948 the National Park Service proposed a \"Lewis and Clark Tour-way\" along the Missouri River from St. Louis to Three Forks, Montana. Later, Jay \"Ding\" Darling proposed the development of the expedition route as a recreational trail. Following a 1966 report by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the National Trails System Act of 1968 listed the route for study as a possible National Scenic Trail. Finally in 1978 the law was amended by the National Parks and Recreation Act to provide for a new category of trail, National Historic Trails, one of which was to be the Lewis and Clark trail. From 2003 to 2006, the National Park Service commemorated the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with the Corps of Discovery II traveling exhibit.\n\nThe 2019 John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act extended the Trail an additional along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Wood River, Illinois.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152113", "title": "Amr ibn Hishām", "text": "Amr ibn Hishām\n\nʿAmr ibn Hishām () (556-13 March 624), also called Abu al-Hakam () or Abū Jahl (), was one of the Meccan polytheist pagan Qurayshi leaders known for his critical opposition towards Muhammad and the early Muslims in Mecca.\n\nHe was brother of Umar Ibn Abi Rabi'ah and the uncle of Umar ibn al-Khattab and one of the arch-enemies of Muhammad and the flag-bearer of opposition towards Islam and the early Muslims. Islam views him as having malevolence and enmity to such an extent that Muhammad gave him the title of \"The Pharaoh of this Ummah\". Muhammad said, “He who calls Abu Jahl 'Abu Hakam' has made a serious mistake. He should seek forgiveness from Allah for this.”\n\nContrary to general misconception, ibn Hisham was not an uncle (as was Abu Lahab) or another blood relative of Muhammad. Muhammad belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, and ibn Hisham belonged to the Banu Makhzūm clan of the Quraysh. Amr ibn Hisham was also known as Asad al-ahlaf, as he was the lion of the opposing groups that had sworn to fight against Islam and Muhammad.\n\nAbu Jahl was fatally and badly wounded by Mu‘awwidh ibn ‘Afrā’ and Mu'ādh ibn 'Amr ibn al-Jamūḥ and eventually killed by Abdullah ibn Masud on March 13, 624, when he died fighting the Muslims in the Battle of Badr.\n\nHis epithet was \"Abū l-Ḥakam\" (أبو الحكم) (literally \"father of wise judgments\") as he was considered a man of deep wisdom, cunning and understanding by the elders of Quraysh for which they trusted his opinion and relied on him as an elite member of their assembly. Even at the age of thirty, he used to attend the special assemblies held at Dār’ an-Nadwa, the residence owned by Ḥakīm ibn Ḥizām, although the rule of age of entry to these private assemblies was at least forty.\n\n‘Amr ibn Hishām showed relentless animosity to Muhammad and rejected his message. Therefore Muhammad referred him as \"Abū Jahl\" (أبو جهل) (literally \"father of ignorance\"). ‘Amr ibn Hishām was also called Ibn al-Ḥanẓalīya from his mother's side.\n\nHis father was Hisham ibn al-Mughirah and his mother was Asma bint Makhrabah ibn Jandal al-Tamimiya, who early to converted being Muslim. He had eight full-siblings, they were:\n\n1. Salama ibn Hisham\n\n2. Urwah ibn Hisham\n\n3. Khalid ibn Hisham\n\n4. Harith ibn Hisham, husband of Fatima bint al-Walid ibn Mugira and father of Umm Hakim (Zara), Abu Sa'd (Sa'id), Abdul Rahman, Mugira and Abd-Allah.\n\n5. al-As ibn Hisham, husband of Sara bint Huqayq and father of Khalid and Walid.\n\n6. Hantamah bint Hisham, wife of Khattab ibn Nufayl and mother of Umar, Fatimah, Zayd and Safiyya.\n\n7. Umm Harmala bint Hisham, wife of al-'As ibn Wa'il and mother of Hisham.\n\nHis first wife Mujalidya bint Amr ibn Umayr ibn Ma'bad ibn Zurara and had three sons, they are:\n\n1. 'Ikrimah, husband of Umm Hakim bint al-Harith\n\n2. Zurara\n\n3. Tamimi\n\nHis second wife is Arwa bint Abi al-As ibn Umayya and had eight daughters, they are:\n\n1. Sakhra\n\n2. Asma\n\n3. Jamila\n\n4. Umm Hakim (Hakima)\n\n5. Umm Sa'id (Sa'ida)\n\n6. Juwayriyya\n\n7. Hunfa'\n\n8. Umm Habib (Habiba)\n\nAmr ibn Hisham had a trace of a scar on his knee which helped 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ūd to identify him among the slain and wounded soldiers of Quraysh in the battlefield of Badr.\n\n'Amr ibn Hishām was almost the same age of Muhammad. Once in their youth, they had been pressed together at the table of 'Abdullah ibn Jud'ān at-Taymī. Muhammad was thinner than ibn Hisham and gave him a push which sent him to his knees and one of them was scratched so deeply that it left a permanent scar.\n\n'Amr was among the chieftains that in varying degrees kept a relentless hostility towards the Muslims.\nAbu Jahl showed fierce opposition against Muhammad when he began preaching publicly. The people of Mecca were mostly devout and were already familiar with the Abrahamic faith as descendants of Isma‘īl. Likewise,and stuck to the social and religious traditions of the community prevalent since the time of his forefathers. However, the following causes of dissension created hostility towards Muhammad:\n\nAbu Jahl once secretly went out by night to listen to Muhammad as he was praying in his house while Abu Sufyan b. Ḥarb and al-Akhnas b. Sharīq al-Thaqafi also did the same thing. Every one of them chose a place to sit where he could listen, and none knew where his fellow was sitting. So they passed the night listening to him, until as the dawn rose, they dispersed. On their way home they met and reproached one another, and one said to the other, 'Don't do it again, for if one of the light-minded fools sees you, you will arouse suspicion in his mind.' Yet they continued doing this for the next two days.\n\nAbu Jahl later told al-Akhnas ibn Sharīq, “We competed with Banū ‘Abd Manāf in everything to attain status and nobility. They fed people, so we also fed people. They gave charity, so we also gave charity. They looked after people; so did we. We did these until we became equal. And now they say, ‘A prophet has come from us who receives revelations from the sky’ How can we possibly be able to compete with this? By Allah, we will never believe in him and we will never accept his message!”\n\nAl-Mughīrah ibn Shu‘bah, a man from aṭ-Ṭā’if, once visited Makkah. He was walking with Abū Jahl ibn Hishām in the streets when they came across Muhammad. Muhammad invited ‘Amr ibn Hishām to Islam by saying, “Why don’t you accept Islam and believe me as the Messenger of Allah?” ‘Amr ibn Hishām said, “O Muhammad, when are you going to stop cursing our gods? If you want us to testify that you have fulfilled your mission, we will testify for you. And if I knew that you are telling the truth, I would have already followed you.” Muhammad then left. ‘Amr ibn Hishām looked at al-Mughīrah and said, “I know that he is telling the truth, but there is something holding me back. The descendants of Quṣayy ibn Kilāb ibn Murrah [whereas Banū Makhzūm was the descendant of Yaqaẓah ibn Murrah] wanted al-Ḥijābah (Guardianship of al-Ka‘bah & preservation of its key), as-Siqāyah (Custody of Zamzam & catering the pilgrims during the Ḥajj), al-Ifādah (Authority of trade & commerce), al-Liwā’ (Authority of the banner of battles), the authority of armed forces and an-Nadwah (Assembly of the Quraysh). We sacrificed all in favor of them [Banū Makhzūm was only in charge of the cavalry, Khālid ibn Walīd being its commander] and started picking up & competing with them. When we are running neck to neck, they say ‘We have a prophet among us’; How can we compete with that? By Allah, we are never going to accept this.”\n\nAbu Jahl stirred up the Meccans against the Muslims. When he heard that a man had become a Muslim, if he was a man of social importance and had relations to defend him, he reprimanded him and poured scorn on him, saying, 'You have forsaken the religion of your father who was better than you. We will declare you a blockhead and brand you as a fool, and destroy your reputation.' If he was a merchant he said, 'we will boycott your goods and reduce you to beggary.' If he was a person of no social importance, he beat him and incited people against him. Therefore, many converted slaves had to suffer the extreme savagery of Abu Jahl.\n\nIt has been told that Amr ibn Hisham often put heavy stones on the backs of his slaves if they made a mistake. Convert slaves belonging to the polytheist Quraysh received the harshest punishment. Abu Jahl beat Ḥarīthah bint al-Mu‘ammil, one such slave, for her conversion to such an extent that she lost her eyesight. He also attacked Sumayyah bint Khayyat, the mother of ‘Ammār ibn Yasir, and inflicted on her mortal wounds by stabbing her with a spear in her private parts. She was the first Muslim to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. Abu Jahl also persecuted ‘Ammar’s father Yasir ibn Amir and his brother ‘Abdullah and tortured them to death right in front of his eyes.\n\nAbu Jahl had once clawed at ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ūd and punched him in Mecca.\n\nThe harassment of Abu Jahl was not only directed to his own people, but his misdemeanor extended to the people outside of Mecca also.\nOnce a man from the tribe of Irāsh came to Makkah complaining that Abu Jahl had bought some camels from him without paying him back. When the Irāshi man asked people to help him, they referred him to Muhammad with the intention of stirring up an argument. Muhammad brought him to Abu Jahl’s house and asked him to give the Irāshi man’s money that he owed him. Abu Jahl immediately came back with the money with his face looking extremely pale and timid. The disappointed Quraysh blamed Abu Jahl with sarcasm later on. He said, “Woe unto you all! As soon as I heard the knock on my door, I heard a terrifying sound which filled me with awe. When I looked to see what it was, it was the most colossal and vicious camel I had ever seen towering over my head. By Allah, if I had delayed or refused it would have devoured me alive!”\n\nWhile Muhammad was in Mecca some twenty Christians came to him from Abyssinia (or Najrān) when they heard news of him. Muhammad answered all their questions and read the Quran to them. Their eyes flowed with tears and they accepted Islam. Abu Jahl intercepted them as they were leaving, saying, 'God, what a wretched band you are! Your people at home sent you to bring them information about the fellow, and as soon as you sat with him you renounced your religion and believed what he said. We don't know a more asinine band than you'. They answered: 'Peace be on you. We will not engage in foolish controversy with you. We have our religion and you have yours. We have not been remiss in seeking what is best.'\n\nOne day Abu Jahl declared, \"I call God to witness that I will wait for him tomorrow with a stone which I can hardly lift and when he prostrates himself in prayer I will split his skull with it. Betray me or defend me, let the Banū 'Abdu Manāf do what they like after that.\" The Qurayshi people said that they would never betray him on any account, and he could carry on with his project. When morning came Abu Jahl took a stone and sat in wait for Muhammad. The apostle rose to pray while Quraysh sat in their meeting, waiting for what Abu Jahl was to do. When the apostle prostrated himself, Abu Jahl took up the stone and went towards him, until when he got near him, he turned back in flight, pale with terror, and his hand had withered upon the stone, so that he cast the stone from his hand. The Quraysh asked him what had happened, and he replied that when he got near him a camel's stallion got in his way. \"By God\", he said, \"I have never seen anything like his head, shoulders, and teeth on any stallion before, and he made as though he would eat me.\"\n\nNarrated ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas: Abu Jahl said, \"If I see Muhammad praying at the Ka'ba, I will tread on his neck.\" When the Prophet heard of that, he said, \"If he does so, the Angels will snatch him away.\"\n\nNarrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud: Once the Prophet was offering prayers at the Ka'ba. Abu Jahl was sitting with some of his companions. One of them said to the others, \"Who amongst you will bring the entrails of a camel of Bani so and so and put it on the back of Muhammad, when he prostrates?\" The most unfortunate of them got up and brought it. He waited till the Prophet prostrated and then placed it on his back between his shoulders. I was watching but could not do anything. I wish I had some people with me to hold out against them. They started laughing and falling on one another. Allah's Apostle was in prostration and he did not lift his head up till Fatima (Prophet's daughter) came and threw that (camel's abdominal contents) away from his back. He raised his head and said thrice, \"O Allah! Punish Quraish.\" So it was hard for Abu Jahl and his companions when the Prophet invoked Allah against them as they had a conviction that the prayers and invocations were accepted in this city (Mecca). The Prophet said, \"O Allah! Punish Abu Jahl, 'Utba bin Rabī'a, Shaiba bin Rabī'a, Al-Walīd bin 'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, and 'Uqba bin Abu Mu'īṭ (and he mentioned the seventh whose name I cannot recall). By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I saw the dead bodies of those persons who were counted by Allah's Apostle in the Qalib (one of the wells) of Badr.\n\nMuslim legend relates that Quraysh polytheists demanded Muhammad to perform most unlikely things possible to prove his prophethood. Once Abu Jahl, along with other leaders including al-Walīd ibn al-Mughīrah, al-‘Āṣ ibn Wā’il, al-‘Āṣ ibn Hishām, Aswad ibn ‘Abd Yaghūth, al-Aswad ibn al-Muṭṭalib, Zam‘ah ibn Aswad, an-Naḍr ibn al-Ḥārith asked Muhammad, “If you truly are a prophet, then split the moon in half so that one half will appear over Mount Abu Qubais and the other over Mount Quayqian.” Muhammad asked, “If I do it, will you become Muslims?” They agreed. On the 14th night, when it was full moon, Muhammad prayed to Allah to give him the miracle. When Gabriel informed him that Allah had granted his prayer, he announced it to the Meccans. The polytheists witnessed the splitting of the moon. Muhammad shouted to the Muslims: “O Abu Salama ibn ‘Abdu’l Asad! Arqām ibn Abi’l Arqām! Bear witness!”\nHowever, the polytheists said “The son of Abu Kabsha cast a spell on you!” Some of them also said: “If Muhammad had cast a spell on us, then he couldn’t have cast a spell on everyone! Let us ask the wayfarers who came from the surrounding areas if they saw what we saw.” So when they asked the people they answered that the moon was indeed split into two. Yet, the polytheists rejected Islam. “This is a prevalent magic”, they said, “Abū Ṭālib’s orphan affected the sky with his spell”. (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhāri 3636, 3638)\n\nAbu Jahl passed by Muhammad at al-Ṣafā, insulted him and behaved most offensively, speaking spitefully of his religion and trying to bring him into disrepute. Muhammad did not speak to him. Now a freedwoman, belonging to 'Abdullah b. Jud'ān b. 'Amr b. Ka'b b. Sa'd b. Taym b. Murra, was in her house listening to what went on. When he went away he betook himself to the assembly of Quraysh at the Ka'ba and sat there. Within a little while Ḥamza b. 'Abdu'I Muṭṭalib arrived, with his bow hanging from his shoulder, returning from the chase, for he was fond of hunting and used to go out shooting. When he came back from a hunt he never went home until he had circumambulated the Ka'ba, and that done when he passed by an assembly of the Quraysh he stopped and saluted and talked with them. He was the strongest man of Quraysh, and the most unyielding. Muhammad had gone back to his house when he passed by this woman, who asked him if he had heard of what ‘Amr b. Hisham had done just recently to his nephew, Muhammad; how he had found him sitting quietly there, and insulted him, and cursed him, and treated him badly, and that Muhammad had answered not a word. Ḥamza was filled with rage, for God purposed to honor him, so he went out at a run and did not stop to greet anyone, meaning to punish Abu Jahl when he met him. When he got to the mosque he saw him sitting among the people, and went up to him until he stood over him, when he lifted up his bow and struck him a violent blow with it, saying, 'Will you insult him when I follow his religion, and say what he says? Hit me back if you can!' Some of Banū Makhzūm got up to go to Abu Jahl's help, but he said, 'Let Abū 'Umāra alone for, by God, I insulted his nephew deeply.'\n\n‘Ayyāsh ibn Abī Rabī‘ah was one of the paternal cousins of ‘Amr ibn Hishām as well as his maternal brother. ‘Ayyāsh was among the early Muslim converts who emigrated to Madīnah before Muhammad. Abu Jahl devised a plan to bring him back to Makkah. Accordingly, he went to Madīnah with his brother Ḥārith and told ‘Ayyāsh a deceptive story about his mother’s illness as a decoy only to provoke his emotion. Abu Jahl also lied about his mother’s making an oath that she would neither sit in the shade nor comb her hair until she saw ‘Ayyāsh again. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb tried to warn him by saying \"This is nothing but an attempt of the people to seduce you from your religion so beware of them; for, by Allah, if lice were causing your mother trouble she would use her comb, and if the heat of Mecca oppressed her she would take shelter from it.\" But ‘Ayyāsh said, \"I will clear my mother from her oath; also I have some money there which I can get.\" ‘Umar told him that he was one of the richest of the Quraysh and he could have half his money if he refused to go with the two men. But when ‘Umar saw that he was determined to go he said, \"If you must go, then take this camel of mine. She is well bred and easy to ride. Don't dismount, and if you suspect them of treachery you can escape on her.\"\nThe three went off and while they were on their way Abu Jahl said, \"Nephew, I find my beast hard to ride. Won't you mount me behind you?\" When he agreed he and they made their camels kneel to make the change over, and whenon the ground they fell on him and bound him securely and brought him to Mecca by day and said, 'O men of Mecca, deal with your fools as we have dealt with this fool of ours.'\n\nThe house of the Banu Jaḥsh was locked up when they left and ‘Utba ibn Rabī‘ah, al-‘Abbās ibn ‘Abdu’l-Muṭṭalib and Abu Jahl passed by it on their way to the upper part of Mecca. ‘Utbah looked at it with its doors blowing to and fro, empty of inhabitants, and sighed heavily and said:\n\n“Every house however long its prosperity lasts will one day be overtaken by misfortune and trouble.”\n\nThen 'Utbah went on to say, ‘The house of the Banu Jaḥsh has become tenantless.’ To which Abu Jahl replied, ‘Nobody will weep over that. This is the work of this man's nephew. He has divided our community, disrupted our affairs, and driven a wedge between us.’\n\nAs a means of deterring Muhammad from spreading his message, the Quraysh laid a boycott on Banū Hāshim and Banū Muṭṭalib. Abū Jahl, met Ḥakīm ibn Ḥizām with whom was a nephew carrying flour intended for his aunt Khadīja who was with him in the mountain gorge. He hung on to him and said, 'Are you taking food to the Banū Hāshim? By Allah, before you and your food move from here I will denounce you in Mecca.' Abū'l-Bakhtarī (al-‘Āṣ) ibn Hishām came to him and said, 'What is going on between you two?' When he said that Ḥakīm was taking food to the Banu Hāshim, he said: 'It is food he has which belongs to his aunt and she has sent to him about it. Are you trying to prevent him taking her own food to her? Let the man go his way'. Abū Jahl refused until they came to blows, and Abū'I-Bakhtarī (al-‘Āṣ) ibn Hishām took a camel's jaw and knocked him down, wounded him, and trod on him violently.\n\nThis situation ultimately created dissension amongst the various Makkan factions, who were tied with the besieged people by blood relations. After three years of blockade and in Muharram, the tenth year of Muhammad's mission, the pact was broken. Hishām ibn ‘Amr, who used to smuggle some food to Banū Hāshim secretly at night, went to see Zuhair ibn Abu Umayyah ibn al-Mughirah, one of Abu Jahl's paternal cousins, and reproached him for resigning to that intolerable treatment meted out to his uncles in exile. The latter pleaded impotence, but agreed to work with Hisham and form a pressure group that would secure the extrication of the exiles. On the ground of motivation by uterine relations, there emerged a group of five people who set out to abrogate the pact and declare all relevant clauses null and void. They were Hishām ibn ‘Amr, Zuhair ibn Abu Umayyah ibn al-Mughirah, Al-Muṭ‘im ibn ‘Adī, Abū'l-Bakhtarī (al-‘Āṣ) ibn Hishām and Zam‘a ibn al-Aswad. They decided to meet in their assembly place and start their self-charged mission from the very precinct of the Sacred House. Zuhair, after circumambulating seven times, along with his colleagues approached the hosts of people there and rebuked them for indulging in the amenities of life whereas their kith and kin of Banū Hāshim were perishing on account of starvation and economic boycott. They swore they would never relent until the parchment of boycott was torn to pieces and the pact broken at once. Abu Jahl, standing nearby, retorted that it would never be torn. Zam‘a was infuriated and accused Abu Jahl of telling lies, adding that the pact was established and the parchment was written without seeking their approval. Abū'l-Bakhtarī intervened and backed Zam‘a. Al-Muṭ‘im bin ‘Adi and Hisham bin ‘Amr attested to the truthfulness of their two companions. Abu Jahl, with a cunning attempt to liquidate the hot argument that was running counter to his malicious goals, answered that the issue had already been resolved sometime and somewhere before. (Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum)\n\nIn the end, Abu Jahl came up with a plan to assassinate Muhammad. Each clan should provide a young, powerful, well-born, aristocratic warrior; that each of these should be provided with a sharp sword; then that each of them should strike a blow at him and kill him. Thus they would be relieved of him, and responsibility for his blood would lie upon all the clans. The Banu 'Abdu Manāf could not fight them all and would have to accept the blood-money which they would all contribute to.\n\nAt the news of Muhammad's flight with Abu Bakr, Abu Jahl rushed to the house of Abu Bakr. When interrogated, Abu Bakr's daughter Asma refused to tell him their whereabouts. Abu Jahl, in a fit rage, slapped her so hard that a few of her teeth came loose and her earring flew off.\n\nAs soon as the Quraysh realized that Muhammad had هاجر\n\nAlthough Muhammad managed to escape for the time being, Abu Jahl would not give up and declared a bounty of 100 of the finest Arab camels for bringing him dead or alive. Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju’shum al-Madlajī raced after Muhammad right away. As he was gaining on them, suddenly the hooves of his stallion sagged in the desert sand and his limbs became paralyzed. So he begged him for mercy. At his entreaty, Muhammad prayed for his relief and let him get away scot-free by making a treaty of maintaining the secrecy of their whereabouts as well as warding off the other pursuers.\n\nWhen Suraqah was completely certain that Muhammad had reached Madīnah, he returned to Makkah relating his miraculous incident to everyone. Since Suraqah was the leader of Banu Madlaj, Abu Jahl feared that his tribe would accept Islam influenced by this story.\nSo Abu Jahl wrote a letter to the Banu Madlaj tribe warning them of the deviation of Suraqah, despised him for his cowardice and selfishness and advised them to disobey him. Suraqah, however, replied to this letter saying, \"O Abu’l Ḥakam! By Allah, had you witnessed how my horse got pinned into the sand, you also would not doubt the prophethood of Muhammad. I truly see that he will soon dominate all of Arabia and everyone will be his followers!\"\n\nPrior to the Battle of Badr, Sa'd ibn Mu‘ādh had visited Mecca once to perform his Umrah with his non-Muslim friend Umayyah ibn Khalaf, when they came across 'Amr. They had an argument, and as it became heated, Sa’d threatened him with stopping the Meccan trade route to Syria and 'Amr informed Umayyah that his life was threatened by Muhammad.\n\n'Abdullah bin Mas'ud narrated:\n\nThe Meccans would not leave Muhammad at peace even in Madinah. So they sent Abu Jahl leading three hundred riders to terrorize the Muslims. Muhammad immediately dispatched a group of thirty Muhajirūn led by Ḥamza ibn ‘Abdu’l-Muṭṭalib (Ibn Sa’d, 2: 9). The two parties confronted each other on the seashore in the neighbourhood of aI-‘Īṣ (in the territory of Juhayna) standing face to face in preparation for battle. In the heat of the moment, Majdi ibn 'Amr al-Juhani intervened and compelled them to lay down their arms. He was at peace with both the parties according to a truce. So the encounter ended up without any fight. At this, Abu Jahl showed much regret in a poem composed by him and hoped for a future victory over the Muslims.\n\nWhen Abu Sufyan ibn Ḥarb sent a distress message to Mecca, the Quraysh marshalled about 1,000 men for battle. Abu Jahl, on the point of his journey to Badr, grabbed the hangings (Ghilāf) of Ka’bah and made an earnest supplication to Allah that He would make whichever party was on the right side victorious.\n\nAbu Jahl's obstinate attitude culminated in an actual fight despite several attempts of intimidation by some Quraysh leaders.\n\nAl-Juḥfa Juhaym ibn al-Ṣalt ibn Makhrama ibn al-Muṭṭalib tried to intimidate the Quraysh belligerents from going into battle based on an ominous vision. But Abū Jahl sardonically replied, \"Here's another prophet from Banū al-Muṭṭalib! He'll know tomorrow if we meet them who is going to be killed!\"\n\nWhen Abū Sufyān ibn Ḥarb saw that he had saved his caravan he sent word to Quraysh, \"Since you came out to save your caravan, your men, and your property, and God has delivered them, go back.\" But Abū Jahl said, \"By Allah, we will not go back until we have been to Badr.\" Badr is the site of one of the Arab fairs where they used to hold a market every year. \"We will spend three days there, slaughter camels and feast and drink, wine, and the girls shall play for us. The Arabs will hear that we have come and gathered together, and will respect us in future. So come on!\"\n\nḤakīm ibn Ḥizām tried to restrain ‘Utbah ibn Rabī‘ah from going to battle based on the report gathered by 'Umayr b. Wahb al-Jumaḥī. On ‘Utbah’s counsel, Ḥakīm approached Abu Jahl so that he might put him off. But Abu Jahl scorned his advice by saying, \"By Allah, his lungs are swollen (with fear) when he saw Muhammad and his companions. No, by Allah, we will not turn back until Allah decides between us and Muhammad. ‘Utba does not believe his own words, but he saw that Muhammad and his companions are (in number as) the eaters of one slaughtered camel, and his son (i.e. Abū Ḥudhayfa ibn ‘Utbah) is among them, so he is afraid lest you slay him.\"\n\nAbu Jahl was fatally wounded in the Battle of Badr by Mu'adh ibn ‘Afrā’ and Mu'ādh ibn 'Amr, but was finally killed by Abdullah ibn Masud.\n\n'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf narrated:\n\nMu'ādh ibn 'Amr ibn al-Jamūḥ said, \"I heard the people saying when Abu Jahl was in a sort of thicket, 'Abu'l-Ḥakam cannot be got at'. When I heard that I made it my business, and made for him. When I got within striking distance I fell upon him and fetched him a blow which sent his foot and half his shank flying. I can only liken it to a date-stone flying from the pestle when it is beaten. His son ‘Ikrima struck me on the shoulder and severed my arm and it hung by the skin from my side, and the battle compelled me to leave him. I fought the whole of the day dragging my arm behind me and when it became painful to me I put my foot on it and standing on it I tore it off.\" He lived after that into the reign of 'Uthmān.\n\nMu‘awwidh ibn ‘Afrā’ passed Abū Jahl as he lay there helpless and smote him until he left him at his last gasp. He himself went on fighting until he was killed. Then 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ūd passed by Abū Jahl when the Apostle had ordered that he was to be searched for among the slain. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ūd said that he found him at his last gasp and put his foot on his neck and said to him: \"Has God put you to shame?\" He replied, \"How has He shamed me? Am I anything more remarkable than a man you have killed? Tell me how the battle went.\" He told him that it went in favor of Allah and His apostle. Abu Jahl said, \"You have climbed high, you little shepherd.\" Then ['Abdullah ibn Mas'ūd] struck off his head and showed his head to Muhammad. When Muhammad saw his lifeless body on the battlefield he said, \"This is the Pharaoh of this Ummah.\"\n\nUpon his death, the people of Quraysh mourned for him and composed elegies and requiems depicting him as a noble, generous and glorified man.\n\n‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbās says that 84 verses of the Quran were revealed regarding Abu Jahl.\n\nThen Abu Jahl came up to him saying, “Should I not stop you from this?!” So the Messenger rebuked him and warned him to stop harassing him. Abu Jahl then told the Prophet, “Do you threaten me when you know very well that I have the most backing and support than anyone in this valley of Makkah?” Allah then revealed:\n\n9. Do you not see the one who forbids?\n\n10. A slave when he (turns to Allah) to pray?\n\n11. Don't you see if he is on (the road of) Guidance?-\n\n12. Or enjoins Righteousness?\n\n13. Don't you see if he denies (Truth) and turns away?\n\n14. Does he not know that Allah sees him?\n\n15. Let him beware! If he does not stop, We will drag him by the forelock\n\n16. A lying, sinful forelock!\n\n17. Then, let him call (for help) to his council (of comrades):\n\n18. We will call on the angels of punishment (to deal with him)!\n\n19. Nay, heed him not: But bow down in adoration, and bring yourself the closer (to Allah)! (Sūrah al-`Alaq, 96: 9-19)\nAbu Jahl then backed off hearing these lines. Ibn ‘Abbās says that if Abu Jahl had called his gang to hurt the Messenger, then Allah would have sent upon him the angels of punishment to deal with him.\n\nOnce Abu Jahl said to the prophet, ‘By Allah, Muhammad, you will either stop cursing our gods, or we will curse the God you serve.’ So Allah revealed concerning that, “Curse not those to whom they pray other than God lest they curse God wrongfully through lack of knowledge.” (Sura 6:108)\n\nWhen Allah mentioned the tree of al-Zaqqūm to strike terror into the Quraysh, Abu Jahl asked them, “O Quraysh, do you know what the tree of al Zaqqūm is with which Muhammad would scare you?” When they said that they did not, he said: “It is Yathrib dates buttered. By Allah, if we get hold of them we will gulp them down in one!” So Allah sent down the following verse: \n“Verily the tree of al-Zaqqūm is the food of the sinner like molten brass seething in their bellies like boiling water.” (Sūra 44: 43)\n\nNarrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Jahl said, \"O Allah! If this (Quran) is indeed the Truth from You, then rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.\" So Allah revealed: \"But Allah would not punish them while you were amongst them, nor He will punish them while they seek (Allah's) forgiveness...\" (8.33) And why Allah should not punish them while they turn away (men) from Al-Masjid-al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque of Mecca)...\" (8.33-34)\n\nAbu Jahl was infamous for his ruthless attitude toward orphans as well. 'Amr, who was a custodian of an orphan, refused to return his belongings once he asked for and drove him away. Allah sent down Sūra Mā‘ūn (107:2-3) regarding this act of cruelty.\n\n"}

This National Historic Site preserves the last remaining Minuteman II ICBM system in the United States. 450 of the newer Minuteman III missiles are still on active duty at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, Minot AFB, North Dakota, and F. E. Warren AFB, Wyoming.\n\nThis National Historic Site consists of three facilities: a main office and two\nsignificant Cold War-era sites, a launch control center and a missile silo/launch facility, formerly operated by the 66th Strategic Missile Squadron of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing, headquartered at Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, South Dakota. The facilities represent the only remaining intact components of a nuclear missile field that once consisted of 150 Minuteman II missiles, 15 launch-control centers, and covered over of southwestern South Dakota.\n\nThe silo, known as launch facility Delta Nine (D-09) was constructed in 1963. It occupies 1.6 acres (6,000 m) nearly one-half mile (800 m) southwest of Interstate 90 at Exit 116 and six miles (10 km) from the town of Wall, South Dakota, in eastern Pennington County. It consists of an underground launch tube (\"missile silo\") in diameter and deep, made of reinforced concrete with a steel-plate liner. An unarmed missile is on display inside. The launch tube's 90-ton cover has been rolled partly away and welded to the rails it rides on. The launch tube was then covered with a glass viewing enclosure. Not only does this permit visitors to see the missile, it means Russian satellites are able to verify that the site is not operational, and hence in compliance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Because the only way to get to the underground part of the site is by a ladder long, tours are not conducted underground for safety reasons. Visitors can conduct self-guided tours of the site during the day by calling a number on their cell phones and walking around the site, listening to the description of various points over the phone.\n\nThe launch control facility, known as Delta One (D-01), is about away, to the east-southeast in northwestern Jackson County. It occupies approximately six acres (24,000 m) about 1.7 miles (2.7 km) north of I-90 at Exit 127. It consists of an above-ground building containing a kitchen, sleeping quarters, offices and life-support equipment. Below this building is the actual launch control center, buried deep, connected to the building by an elevator. Guided tours are conducted underground here, but are limited to six people at a time due to the very small underground launch control center (\"capsule\") and are a half-hour long. Self-guided tours are not possible here; the gate for the fence around D-01 is always locked, just like it was when it was an active launch control facility.\n\nThe complex, one of six located in the central United States, was built as a deterrent to a nuclear first strike by the Soviet Union. By placing missiles underground in widely separated locations, it was hoped that regardless of the size of a Soviet missile attack, enough US missiles would survive to ensure devastation on the aggressor nation. The Minutemen in this complex remained on alert for nearly 30 years until the wing was deactivated following the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by President George Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. Under the terms of the treaty, the missiles in this complex were removed from their silos, and in 1994 the 44th Missile Wing was deactivated. All sites in the complex, except D-01 and D-09, have been destroyed.\n\nD-01 and D-09 were candidates for becoming a national historic site for a few reasons:\n\nThe Minuteman Missile National Historic Site was the subject of a 2013 federal law – Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Boundary Modification Act (S. 459; 113th Congress) – which granted the park additional land.\n\n\n"}

As a sophomore, he led the team in scoring with 16.3 points per game and in rebounding with 7.6 per game, as Miami went 24-6 and won the Mid-American Conference championship, the MAC tournament championship, and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nIn his junior season, he set personal bests and again led the team with 24.9 and 10.7 rebounds per game and also led in steals with 2.6 per game. He was named MAC Player of the Year as the team went 20-11, finished second in the MAC and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nIn his senior season, on March 8, 1985, he set both a Miami and a MAC tournament single-game scoring record of 45 points in one game (as well as snaring 18 rebounds). His scoring average of 24.9 per game is second all-time at Miami behind Fred Foster's 26.8 in 1967–68. He again led the team in rebounding with 11.7 per game as well as assists (4.3) and steals (3.3). He also became the first MAC player in history to record a triple-double with 38 points, 19 rebounds and 12 assists against Ball State University.\n\nAgain he was named MAC Player of the Year and also named second-team All-American by both the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI). Miami went 24-7 to win the MAC title and earn a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nHarper is Miami's all-time leading scorer with 2,377 points, and also leads both in rebounding with 1,119. He was the first men's player in MAC history to score 2,000 points and grab 1,000 rebounds in a career. He also holds Miami's all-time records for career scoring average (19.8), games started (118), minutes played (4,164), field goals (969), and blocked shots (173). He had a career field goal percentage of .534.\n\nAt his final home game in 1986, he became the first basketball player in Miami history to have his number (34) retired.\n\nHarper was selected in the first round (eighth overall) in the 1986 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Harper made his NBA debut on November 1, 1986. He broke 30 points in just his sixth game, with 34 against the Sacramento Kings on November 11, 1986. He scored a season-high 40 points against the Boston Celtics on February 4, 1987 and had one of his finest all-around games on February 10, 1987 against the New York Knicks with 25 points, 16 rebounds, four assists and five steals.\n\nHarper started all 82 games and averaged 22.9 points per game (ppg) and 4.8 rebounds per game (rpg) along with 4.8 assists and 2.5 steals. He placed second in Rookie of the Year balloting behind Chuck Person of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nIn his second season, he was limited to 57 games due to a severely sprained ankle suffered in the second game of the season that kept him out until late December. For the season, he averaged 15.4 ppg. The Cavaliers made the playoffs, but were eliminated by the Chicago Bulls, three games to two.\n\nThe following season, 1988–89, he again started all 82 games, averaging 18.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 5.3 assists and 2.3 steals as the Cavaliers advanced to the playoffs, where they were eliminated in the first round, again by the Chicago Bulls three games to two, this time with a one-point loss in game 5 in Chicago.\n\nIn his fourth season, 1989–90, after seven games with the Cavaliers, on November 16, 1989 he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHarper started all 28 games he played for the Clippers, but his season was cut short by a serious right knee injury suffered in a game in January 1990. Diagnosed with both a torn anterior cruciate ligament and torn cartilage, he underwent surgery.\n\nFor the 1989–90 season overall, he averaged 22.8 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 5.2 assists, 2.3 steals and a career-high 1.2 blocks per game. His season was highlighted by back-to-back 39-point games against Denver and Indiana in December 1989, both of which the Clippers won. \n\nIn his next season, 1990–91, he was limited to 39 games, but still posted averages of 19.6 ppg and 4.8 rpg along with 5.4 assists and 1.7 steals \n\nBy 1991–92, his sixth NBA season, he bounced back to start all 82 games, averaging 18.2 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 5.1 assists and 1.9 steals. as the Clippers advanced to the playoffs, where they were eliminated three games to two by the Utah Jazz.\n\nIn 1992–93, Harper was named a co-captain (along side Danny Manning and Mark Jackson). In 80 games (77 as a starter), Harper averaged 18.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 4.5 assists and 2.2 steals. The Clippers again made the playoffs, but yet again Harper's team was eliminated in the first round, this time three games to two by the Houston Rockets.\n\nIn 1993–94, his fourth full season with the Clippers and eighth in the NBA, he played and started in 75 games, averaging 20.1 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 4.6 assists and 1.9 steals. On March 11, 1994, he tallied a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists along with six steals in a win over the Dallas Mavericks. Two nights later, he came within one assist of duplicating the feat, with 39 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists plus another six steals in a win over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nOn September 15, 1994, Harper signed a free agent deal with the Chicago Bulls, who were reloading following the first retirement of Michael Jordan. Harper found his niche with the Bulls upon Jordan's return, eventually becoming a fan favorite by reinventing himself as a big perimeter defender, ball handler, and mid-range scorer.\n\nIn his first season in Chicago, 1994–95, Harper started 53 of the 77 games he played, although his minutes dipped to 19.9 per game and he averaged a then-career low of 6.9 ppg. For the first time in Harper's career, his team advanced past the first round of the playoffs, as the Bulls defeated the Charlotte Hornets three games to one before losing to the Orlando Magic four games to two in the conference semifinals.\n\nIn 1995–96, Harper's 10th NBA season, he played in and started 80 games, with his playing time increasing to 23.6 minutes per game and his scoring average to 7.4 ppg. It was a record-setting season for the Bulls as the team, coached by Phil Jackson and led by Jordan and Scottie Pippen and with Harper playing a key role, had a then NBA all-time best record of 72-10. They then defeated the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, and Orlando Magic in the first three rounds of the playoffs en route to winning their fourth NBA championship four games to two over the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nIn 1996–97, he played in 76 games, starting 74 and averaging 6.3 ppg. The Bulls had another dominant regular season with a record of 69-13 as they defeated the Washington Bullets, Atlanta Hawks and Miami Heat in the first three rounds of the playoffs en route to winning their fifth NBA championship, this time four games to two over the Utah Jazz.\n\nIn 1997–98, Harper's 12th NBA season, he started all 82 games for the Bulls, increasing his minutes per game to 27.9 and his scoring average to 9.3 ppg. The Bulls had a regular-season record of 62-20 as they defeated the New Jersey Nets, Charlotte Hornets and Indiana Pacers in the first three rounds of the playoffs en route to winning their sixth NBA championship, again four games to two over the Utah Jazz.\n\nHarper played his final season with the Bulls during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season.\nWith the Bulls roster depleted due to the second retirement of Michael Jordan, as well as the losses of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the Bulls floundered to a 13-37 record. Harper played 35 games, starting all of them. He finished second on the team with 11.2 ppg.\n\nDuring his five seasons with the Bulls, he averaged about 25 minutes per game, averaging between 6.3 and 11.2 ppg during those seasons.\n\nAfter being released by the Bulls prior to the 1999–2000 season, on October 13, 1999, he signed a two-year contract as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers and his former Bulls coach, Phil Jackson.\n\nDuring the 1999–2000 season, Harper started 78 of 80 games playing much the same role as he did for the Bulls, averaging 7.0 ppg and finishing second on the Lakers in steals behind Kobe Bryant. Led by Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers won 67 games and secured the league's best record as they defeated the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Portland Trail Blazers in the first three rounds of the playoffs. In the final minute of game 3 in Portland, Harper caught a pass from Bryant in the left corner and sank a 19-foot jump shot with 29.9 seconds remaining to give the Lakers a 93-91 lead. On the final play of the game, Harper helped Bryant block a shot by Arvydas Sabonis to seal the Lakers' victory. The Lakers would win the series in seven games to set up a match-up with the Indiana Pacers in the Finals. In game 2, Bryant sprained his ankle and left the game. Harper and Glen Rice picked up the slack with 21 points apiece to help the Lakers take a 2-0 lead. The Lakers would go on to win the NBA championship over the Pacers four games to two. Harper started all 23 games in the postseason and averaged 8.6 points per game, earning his fourth NBA championship ring.\n\nThe 2000–2001 season was Harper's 15th and final NBA season. Injuries limited him to 47 games (starting 46). By season's end, Derek Fisher had taken over the starting point guard slot, and Harper would only play in six games during the playoffs. The Lakers reached the Finals, where they faced the Philadelphia 76ers. Following the Sixers' win in game 1, the Lakers won games 2 and 3. In game 4, Harper made crucial shots on the way to eight points, his best point total for the series. The Lakers won games 4 and game 5 to win their second straight NBA championship. It earned Harper his fifth NBA championship ring in a six-year span.\n\nIn 2005, Harper signed as an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons. His two-year deal was not renewed in 2007.\n\nOn November 1, 1997, Ron Harper appeared in the Nickelodeon sitcom \"Kenan & Kel\", in the episode titled \"Foul Bull\". In the episode, Harper, as a Chicago Bull, slips on some orange soda and gets injured, and all of Chicago is angry with Kenan and Kel, who try to apologize.\n\nHarper has battled stuttering for most of his life, and donates his time to the National Stuttering Association to encourage others with this problem to not let it hinder them.\n\nHarper is the father of current Rutgers basketball player, Ron Harper Jr., and is godfather to R. J. Hunter.\n\n\n"}

It is known for being the location of the headquarters of the Elan Line company.\n\nBegunje na Gorenjskem was first attested in written sources in 1050 as \"Begûn\" (and in 1063 as \"Uegun\"). The name of the settlement is derived from the personal name \"*Běgunъ\", probably as a clipped version of \"*Běgun'e (selo)\" 'Běgunъ's village' (i.e., a neuter singular form) that later shifted to a feminine plural form. In Slovene, the settlement was originally simply called \"Begunje\" but the modifier \"na Gorenjskem\" 'in Upper Carniola' was later added to distinguish it from Begunje pri Cerknici (literally, 'Begunje near Cerknica'). In older sources, the settlement was sometimes named \"Begunje pri Lescah\" ()—that is, 'Begunje near Lesce', which also corresponded to the parish name.\n\nThe ruins of 12th-century Kamen (German: \"Stein\" or \"Stain\") Castle are just outside the village in the Draga Valley. First documented in 1185, it appeared as \"Castrum Lapis\" in 1263 and \"Stain\" in 1350, when it passed into the Carniolan possessions of the Counts of Ortenburg. The castle played a vital role in protecting the comital lands in the Bohinj and Upper Sava Valley. When the Ortenburgs became extinct in 1418, it passed to Count Hermann II of Celje and was inherited by the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1456.\n\nThe 15th-century Kacenštajn Castle, rebuilt in the late 17th century, stands in the centre of the village. The castle was used as women's prison in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and it was seized as Upper Carniolan headquarters of the Nazi German Gestapo during the war. After the war, a Yugoslav labor camp for political prisoners operated in the village. A memorial and a museum dedicated to the victims were set up in part of the building, which today houses a psychiatric hospital accepting patients from all over the Upper Carniola region.\n\nBegunje na Gorenjskem is the site of several mass graves from during and after the Second World War. During the war, the Germans held 12,134 hostages at Kamen Castle; 1,282 inmates were killed, and others were deported to Nazi concentration camps such as Mauthausen. Mass graves of tortured and shot Slovenes are located in the castle park and in the Draga Valley to the east.\n\nImmediately after the Second World War, six known mass graves were created as a result of executions by the communists. The Krpin Gravel Pit 1 and 2 mass graves () are located north of the settlement; the first is in the bushes a few meters above the paved road, between a gravel pit and a dirt road, and the second is a few dozen meters higher, on a slope to the left of the path. The graves contain the remains of at least 20 Russian Liberation Army prisoners of war and civilians that were murdered at the end of June or beginning of July 1945. The Krpin Ski Slope 1–3 mass graves () are located north of the settlement; the first and second are in a picnic area behind a shed, and the third is on level ground behind the ski slope. The graves contain the remains of Russian Liberation Army prisoners of war and civilians murdered at two locations in the nearby gravel pit. The Mazevec Crevasse Mass Grave () is located north of Kamen Castle, on the edge of a quarry below a large spruce tree, and is 10 m long. It contains the remains of German prisoners of war from Begunje and probably also civilian victims murdered on 29 May 1945.\n\nThe parish church in Begunje na Gorenjskem is dedicated to Saint Ulrich. It is a Baroque structure that was built from 1740 to 1743. It has a cupola vault, a bell tower centered with the front side of the church, and furnishings created by Leopold Layer (1752–1828) and Janez Vurnik (1849–1911). The interior was painted by Matija Bradaška (1852–1915) in 1894 and 1897. The side altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary was taken from Kacenštajn Castle.\n\nNotable people that were born or lived in Begunje na Gorenjskem include:\n\n"}

McDermott Jr. (August 12, 1891 – August 1, 1971) was the first U.S.-born golfer to win the U.S. Open, in 1911 and 1912, and he remains the youngest player to win the event, at age 19, as well as the second youngest to win any of golf's four major tournaments after Young Tom Morris. He was the first player to break par over 72 holes in a significant event, which he did at the 1912 U.S. Open. He was one of the world's top players between 1910 and 1914.\n\nMcDermott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a mailman. He was a good student at West Philadelphia High School, but dropped out before graduation to become a professional golfer. He worked as a caddie at the Aronimink Golf Club, and learned golf from its longtime head professional Walter Reynolds.\n\nMcDermott's first professional job was at the Merchantville Field Club (now the Merchantville Country Club) in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He moved to the Atlantic City Country Club, where his practice regimen became legendary. As a teenager, he made his debut in the U.S. Open in 1909, scoring 322 for 49th place.\n\n\"He had a long, loose, flowing swing,\" according to golf historian Robert Sommers, \"somewhat like the old St. Andrew’s swing of the feather-ball period, but with more body turn\".\n\nThe first sixteen Opens had all been won by British golfers who had learned the game in England or Scotland, and visited the United States to play in tournaments, or in most cases, lived in the U.S. and worked as club professionals. By 1910 the U.S. was starting to produce its own professionals in quantity.\n\nMcDermott improved his game dramatically in one year, and lost out in an 18-hole playoff to Alex Smith in the 1910 U.S. Open, held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club (St. Martin's course); Macdonald Smith, the younger brother of Alex, was also in the playoff. The three players had tied at 298 over 72 holes. Early in 1911, McDermott challenged Philadelphia-area professionals to matches at $1,000 each, after he won three straight, the competition vanished.\n\nLater that year he won the U.S. Open by three shots at the Chicago Golf Club, following another three-way playoff, where he won over George Simpson and Mike Brady; the three players had tied at 307 for 72 holes. McDermott remains the youngest U.S. Open Champion of all time at , and he was the first American-born champion. In 1912 he retained his title at the Country Club of Buffalo in New York State. He shot 294 for four rounds on a par 74 course, a score of two under par, making him the first man to break par for 72 holes in a high-standard event. Following his second straight national championship, McDermott's finances blossomed, with golf clubs being marketed under his name, endorsements for golf balls, and demand for his high-standard golf with lucrative exhibition matches. McDermott made his first attempt at the British Open in 1912, but failed to qualify for the championship proper. But he returned to Britain the next year, and tied for fifth place in the Open at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club. This was the best finish by an American player to that stage.\n\nIn 1913, McDermott won the Western Open, then the second most prestigious professional tournament in the United States. He also won the Philadelphia Open Championship three times: 1910, 1911, and 1913.\n\nAlso in 1913, McDermott won the Open tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania, finishing ahead of top Englishmen Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.\n\nAfter the 1912 British Open, McDermott lost heavily on investments. Then, following his 1913 win at Shawnee over Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, he boasted excessively, was criticized by his fellow players and the crowd for this, and had to apologize; it seems there were no lasting hard feelings. As the defending champion, he finished four strokes behind the leaders at the 1913 U.S. Open at The Country Club in Boston, in a tie for 8th place. He tied for 9th place in the 1914 U.S. Open, as Walter Hagen won over the Midlothian Club near Chicago.\n\nIn 1914, McDermott visited the United Kingdom again to compete in the British Open, but because of travel difficulties, he arrived too late to play. On his way home his ship, the SS \"Kaiser Wilhelm II\", collided with another vessel, the British-flagged grain carrier \"Incemore\", in foggy, misty conditions in the English Channel. The ship returned to port and the passengers were transferred to the SS \"Imperator\" the next day. This dangerous incident apparently had a serious effect upon him. Shortly afterward, upon his return home, he blacked out when entering the clubhouse at the Atlantic City Country Club, where he was the club professional. He was only 23 years old. He spent the rest of his life in mental hospitals and rest homes, or living with his family in Philadelphia, suffering from mental illness. He competed sporadically in regional golf events into the 1920s, but without notable success. He occasionally spectated at important golf events near his home, and watched the 1971 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club, some six weeks before his death.\n\nAlthough McDermott was the first American U.S. Open champion, it is Francis Ouimet's 1913 U.S. Open victory that is most often cited as the key event that sparked widespread interest in golf in the United States. Ouimet won a three-man playoff against Vardon and Ray (widely regarded as the best golfers in the world at the time), and this led to a dramatic rise in Americans' interest in golf. McDermott, along with Ouimet and Walter Hagen, all three of whom were born between 1891 and 1893, represented the new wave of American-born golf talent. The three showed they could compete on even terms with the best players in the world, and American dominance of golf would be established by the early 1920s, assisted by stars like Gene Sarazen and Bobby Jones.\n\nGolf historian Robert Sommers wrote that, if not for his illness, McDermott could have been the greatest of them all.\n\nMcDermott is portrayed by actor Michael Weaver in the 2005 golf film \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\", which tells the story of Ouimet's 1913 U.S. Open triumph. McDermott appears prominently in one memorable scene where, dashingly dressed and celebrating with a few drinks, he issues a loud, boastful challenge to a group of golfers in the clubhouse, before the start of the tournament; he also features in the golf sequences, contending for a while before falling back. The portrayal is apparently true to character, and based primarily on the infamous scene at the Shawnee tournament shortly before the Open began.\n\n\nDefeated Mike Brady and George Simpson in an 18-hole playoff – McDermott 80 (+4), Brady 82 (+6), Simpson 85 (+9).\n\n\"Note: McDermott only played in the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\"<br>\n\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152150", "title": "Pecos National Historical Park", "text": "Pecos National Historical Park\n\nPecos National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park in San Miguel and Santa Fe Counties, New Mexico. The park, operated by the National Park Service, encompasses thousands of acres of landscape infused with historical elements from prehistoric archaeological ruins to 19th-century ranches, to a battlefield of the American Civil War. Its largest single feature is Pecos Pueblo, a Native American community abandoned in historic times. First a state monument in 1935, it was made Pecos National Monument in 1965, and greatly enlarged and renamed in 1990. Two sites within the park, the pueblo and the Glorieta Pass Battlefield, are National Historic Landmarks.\n\nPecos National Historical Park's main unit is located in western San Miguel County, about east of Santa Fe and just south of Pecos.\n\nThe main unit of the park preserves the ruins of Pecos Pueblo, also known historically as Cicuye. The first Pecos pueblo was one of two dozen rock-and-mud villages built in the valley around AD 1100 in the prehistoric Pueblo II Era. Within 350 years the Pueblo IV Era Pecos village had grown to house more than 2,000 people in its five-storied complex.\n\nThe main unit also protects the remains of Mission Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles de Porciúncula de los Pecos, a Spanish mission near the pueblo built in the early 17th century. A self-guiding trail begins at the nearby visitor center and winds through the ruins of Pecos Pueblo and the mission church.\nPecos was visited by expeditionaries with Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1540. The Spanish mission church was built in 1619. A traditional kiva was built in front of the church during the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 as a rejection of the Christian religion brought by Spanish colonists. However, when the Spanish returned in 1692, the Pecos community stayed on friendly terms with them. The site was abandoned in 1838, after the Pecos population suffered from marauding Comanches. The surviving remnant of the Pecos population moved to the Jemez Pueblo.\n\nThe Pecos people enjoyed a rich culture with inventive architecture and beautiful crafts. They also possessed an elaborate religious life, evidenced by many ceremonial kivas. Farming was a main part of their diet and staple crops included the usual beans, corn, and squash. Their location, power and ability to supply goods made the Pecos a major trade center in the eastern part of the Puebloan territory, connecting the Pueblos to the Plains cultures such as the Comanche.\n\nAnother part of the park is the Forked Lightning Ranch, a cattle ranch established in the 1920s by Tex Austin, a famous producer of rodeos. It was headquartered at the Kozlowski's Stage Stop and Tavern, a stagecoach stop on the Santa Fe Trail that had also served as a Union forces encampment before the Battle of Glorieta Pass. It was only a cattle ranch for a time before Austin converted it into a dude ranch which he promoted to Easterners. The main ranch was designed by John Gaw Meem in the Pueblo Revival style. Austin's heavily mortgaged endeavour failed, closing in 1933. In 1936 the ranch again became a working cattle ranch, and in 1941 it was purchased by Buddy Fogelson, a Texas oilman who married actress Greer Garson. After her husband died, Garson sold her share of the park in 1991 to a conservation group, which donated it to the Park Service.\n\nPortions of the historic Santa Fe Trail run through all units of the park. This rutted wagon trail was one of the major routes by which the American Southwest grew in the 19th century.\n\nThe Battle of Glorieta Pass was fought March 26–28, 1862 in the mountain pass west of Pecos Pueblo, along the route of the Old Santa Fe Trail. Confederate forces were en route to take Union-controlled Fort Union, and were fought to a standoff by militia raised in the Colorado Territory. Although parts of the battlefield have been compromised by highway construction, two sections of the battlefield have been preserved by the Park Service on either side of the pass. Access to these units is limited; requests should be made at the main unit visitor's center.\n\nPecos Pueblo and an area of was acquired by the state and preserved as a state monument in 1935. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson established Pecos National Monument over the same area, and control was turned over the Park Service. In 1990 the main unit of the park was expanded to more than , including a large area of ranchland and archaeologically sensitive landscapes. The two units of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield were formally added to the park in 1993.\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1979, DS was affiliated to the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. DS was one of the first groups to affiliate with the Workers' Party (PT) when the PT formed in 1980. The activists in Socialist Democracy hoped to transform the PT into a revolutionary socialist party. As the PT grew, DS grew to become one of the largest Trotskyist organizations in the world.\n\nDS has been most prominent in the municipal government of Porto Alegre, where DS member Raul Pont was vice-mayor from 1992 to 1996 and mayor from 1996 to 2000, and the state government of Rio Grande do Sul. DS members played a significant role in the elaboration of the Participatory Budget (though they had initially opposed its introduction) and also in the arrangements for the three World Social Forums held in Porto Alegre.\n\nIn recent years, the PT has become more moderate, especially after party leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva became President of Brazil in 2003. This caused tension in the entire left wing of the PT, including in Socialist Democracy. In 2004, Heloísa Helena (a member of DS and a Brazilian Senator) and other dissident PT members were expelled from the party, and they formed the Socialism and Liberty Party (P-SOL). Part of the DS tendency remained in the PT, but another part left to join the P-SOL. Those who entered PSOL formed a tendency called Enlace. The DS majority remaining in the PT has come to be the core of attempts to unseat the PT's current leadership, with DS member Raul Pont narrowly losing with 48% of the votes in a 2005 election for the presidency of the PT.\n\n"}

Beginning in 2000, he toured hundreds of national college campuses and high schools performing, teaching, and discussing poverty, racism, multiculturalism, civil rights, and critical race theory. He performed \"End of Racism\" for four years when he got an idea for another kind of progressive comedy experience which addressed another kind of prejudice, that was spreading rapidly throughout non-Islamic communities in post-9/11 America.\n\nIn May 2004, Moss and other Muslim comedians Azhar Usman and Azeem Muhammad (later replaced by Mohammed Amer in 2006) launched a comedy tour titled \"Allah Made Me Funny\", \"Allah Made Me Funny\" toured 30 U.S. cities during its first year, and also in Canada, Europe, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East.\n\nMoss has performed at the Global Peace and Unity Event in the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London organised by Islam Channel. He has also performed at the Oklahoma Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations banquet in Oklahoma City in 2010.\nPreacher can be seen in the upcoming documentary, \"The Muslims Are Coming!\", which features a group of Muslim American comedians touring the U.S. in an effort to counter Islamophobia.\n\nIn March 2013, Moss started the process of securing funds to develop a pilot for a sitcom \"Here Come the Muhammads\". In October 2013, production for the sitcom started.\n\nMoss talks about his conversion from Christianity to Islam. He uses his experiences of being black and Muslim in America as a vantage point for asides on race and religion.\n\nIn 2003, Moss married Yasmin, an Indian Muslim living in Toronto, Canada. When not on tour, he lives in Long Beach, California, and frequently visits his mother's home in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152171", "title": "Sitka National Historical Park", "text": "Sitka National Historical Park\n\nSitka National Historical Park (earlier known as Indian River Park and Totem Park) is a national historical park in Sitka in the U.S. state of Alaska. It was redesignated as a national historical park from its previous status as national monument on October 18, 1972. The park in its various forms has sought to commemorate the Tlingit and Russian experiences in Alaska.\n\nThe history of Alaska's oldest federally designated cultural and historic park dates back to June 21, 1890 when President Benjamin Harrison set aside the site of the Tlingit fort \"Shis'kí Noow\" (Tlingit for \"Sapling Fort\") for public use. The site, located near the mouth of the Indian River, served in 1804 as the location of an armed conflict between the native Tlingit people and Russian fur hunters (accompanied by their Aleut allies), known today as the Battle of Sitka.\n\nFrom 1903 to 1905, District Governor John G. Brady set about acquiring Native totem poles from all over Alaska for display at the park; the majority of the poles came from Haida villages located on Prince of Wales Island, while others had been on display at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Shortly thereafter, a group of influential Sitkans concerned about vandalism and the poor condition of the park in general pressured the federal government to declare the site a national monument.\nThe Sitka National Monument was proclaimed by President William H. Taft under the Antiquities Act on March 23, 1910 to preserve the fort site and totem pole collection and protect them from further harm. With the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, the monument fell under the new agency's care, though no significant appropriation was made until 1921. Many of the poles exhibited today along the park's two miles (3.2 kilometers) of wooded pathways are replicas of the deteriorating originals, now held in protective storage. Interspersed among the giant Sitka spruce trees are a variety of ferns, shrubs and flowers. Salmon can be seen swimming up Indian River during spawning season.\n\nThe 112-acre (45-hectare) park was placed under the control of the U.S. Army in 1942 and briefly occupied for defensive purposes, during which a series of military construction projects resulted in the removal of massive amounts of gravel from the park's river, shoreline and estuary. Environmental impacts from the gravel removal were to be a major resource issue for decades after. Responsibility for the park was formally returned to the Department of the Interior in 1947. In 1965, a new visitor center (the park's first true visitor facility, which provides space for exhibits and demonstrations of Alaska Native arts and crafts) was opened. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.\n\nIn a groundbreaking arrangement, the Alaska Native Brotherhood assumed control of the demonstration program and established its focus on Southeast Alaska Native cultural arts in 1969; the Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center celebrated its 30th anniversary in January 2000. Many of the remarkable Tlingit artifacts in the collection were loaned or donated by local clans under agreements designed to ensure ongoing, traditional use.\n\nLocated approximately one–half mile from the Park, the Russian Bishop's House was constructed out of native spruce in 1841-43 by Tlingit workers overseen by Finnish builders. It is one of only four surviving examples of Russian Colonial Style architecture in the Western Hemisphere. Bishop Innocent (Ivan Evseyevich Popov Veniaminov) of the Russian Orthodox Church, a clergyman, teacher and linguist, occupied the residence until 1853. The Church operated the facility as a school, residence, and place of worship for another century, until the dilapidated condition forced its abandonment in 1969 and sale in 1973 to the Park Service.\n\nIn 1973, the Park Service embarked on a 16–year restoration project to return the property to its former glory. Modern plumbing, heating, and electrical systems were installed, while at the same time keeping the structure as authentic as possible. The second floor was restored to its 1853 appearance, based on archaeological evidence and early diaries and drawings. Today, numerous exhibits and lavish icons in the Chapel of the Annunciation convey the legacy of Russian America.\n\nThe Russian Bishop's House is a National Historic Landmark; both it and the main area of the park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n Though some sources indicate that the Bishop's house is one of \"four\" remaining examples of Russian Colonial architecture in North America, the National Park Service more ambiguously suggests it is one of \"few\" remaining such examples.\n\n"}
{"id": "2152173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152173", "title": "United Kingdom National DNA Database", "text": "United Kingdom National DNA Database\n\nThe United Kingdom National DNA Database (NDNAD; officially the \"UK National Criminal Intelligence DNA Database\") is a national DNA Database that was set up in 1995. In 2005 it had 3.1 million profiles, by 2015 it had 5.77 million and as of 2016 it has 5.86 million. The database, which was growing in 2007 by 30,000 samples each month, is populated by samples recovered from crime scenes and taken from police suspects although data for those not charged or not found guilty are deleted.\n\nOnly patterns of short tandem repeats are stored in the NDNAD – not a person's full genomic sequence. Currently the sixteen loci of the DNA-17 system are analysed, resulting in a string of 32 numbers, being two allele repeats from each of the sixteen loci. Amelogenin is used for a rapid test of a donor's sex.\n\nHowever, individuals' skin or blood samples are also kept permanently linked to the database and can contain complete genetic information. Because DNA is inherited, the database can also be used to indirectly identify many others in the population related to a database subject. Stored samples can also degrade and become useless, particularly those taken with dry brushes and swabs.\n\nThe UK NDNAD is run by the Home Office, after transferring from the custodianship of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) on 1 October 2012. A major expansion to include all known active offenders was funded between April 2000 and March 2005 at a cost of over £300 million.\n\nThe United Kingdom's National DNA Database (NDNAD) was set up in 1995 using the Second Generation Multiplex (SGM) DNA profiling system (SGM+ DNA profiling system since 1998). All data held on the National DNA Database is governed by a tri-partite board consisting of the Home Office, the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, there are also independent representatives present from the Human Genetics Commission. The data held on the NDNAD is owned by the police authority which submitted the sample for analysis. The samples are stored permanently by the companies that analyse them, for an annual fee.\n\nAll forensic service providers in the UK which meet the accredited standards can interact with the NDNAD. The UK's NDNAD is the foremost and largest forensic DNA database of its kind in the world – containing nearly 10% of the population, compared to 0.5% in the USA.\n\nThe data held on the National DNA Database consists of both demographic sample data and the numerical DNA profile. Records on the NDNAD are held for both individuals sampled under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and for unsolved crime-stains (such as from blood, semen, saliva, hair and cellular materials left at a crime scene)\n\nWhenever a new profile is submitted, the NDNAD's records are automatically searched for matches (hits) between individuals and unsolved crime-stain records and unsolved crime-stain to unsolved crime-stain records - linking both individuals to crimes and crimes to crimes. Matches between individuals only are reported separately for investigation as to whether one is an alias of the other. Any NDNAD hits obtained are reported directly to the police force which submitted the sample for analysis. The NDNAD is widely acknowledged as an intelligence tool, for its ability to aid in the solving of crimes, both past and present.\nOne-off speculative intelligence searches can be initiated by scientists in instances where a crime-stain DNA profile does not meet the required standard for loading to the NDNAD. These searches can produce many matches which may be restricted by demographic data.\n\nThe latest innovative intelligence approach brought forward by the Forensic Science Service, is in the use of familial searching. This is a process that may be carried out in relation to unsolved crime-stains whereby a suspect's DNA may not be held on the NDNAD, but that of a close relative is. This method identifies potential relatives by identifying DNA profiles held on the NDNAD that are similar. Again many matches may be produced which may be restricted by demographic data. However, this technique raises new privacy concerns because it could lead to the police identifying cases of non-paternity.\n\nIn April 2007, responsibility for the delivery of National DNA Database (NDNAD) services was transferred from the Home Office to the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA).\nThe agency's role was to run the database operations and maintain and ensure the integrity of the data, and to oversee the National DNA Database service so that it is operated in line with agreed standards.\n\nThough initially only samples from convicted criminals, or people awaiting trial, were recorded, the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changed this to allow DNA to be retained from people charged with an offence, even if they were subsequently acquitted. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 later allowed DNA to be taken on arrest, rather than on charge. Between 2004 when this law came into force and 2012, anyone arrested in England and Wales on suspicion of involvement in any recordable offence (all except the most minor offences) had their DNA sample taken and stored in the database, whether or not they are subsequently charged or convicted. In 2005-06 45,000 crimes were matched against records on the DNA Database; including 422 homicides (murders and manslaughters) and 645 rapes. However, not all these matches would have led to criminal convictions and some would be matches with innocent people who were at the crime scene. Critics argued that the decision to keep large numbers of innocent people on the database did not appear to have increased the likelihood of solving a crime using DNA. Since the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 in 2012, those not charged or not found guilty must have their DNA data deleted within a specified period of time.\n\nThe PFSLD houses the DNA database for Scotland, and exports copies to the National DNA Database in England.\n\nOnly samples from convicted criminals, or people awaiting trial, are recorded, although a new law will allow the DNA from people charged with a serious sexual or violent offence to be kept for up to five years after acquittal.\n\nSamples collected by the Isle of Man Constabulary's Scientific Support Department from crime scenes are sent to the UK for testing against the database. Samples from suspects are also added to the database, but are removed if the suspect is not convicted of the crime.\n\nData supplied by the police of Jersey and Guernsey is also stored on the database.\n\nThe issue of taking fingerprints and a DNA sample was involved in a case decided at the High Court in March 2006. A teacher who was accused of assault won the right to have her DNA sample and fingerprints destroyed. They had been taken whilst she was in custody, but after the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to not pursue any charges against her. She should have been released expeditiously once this was the case and so her continued detention to obtain samples was unlawful, and thus the samples were taken \"without appropriate authority\". Had they been taken before the decision not to prosecute, the samples would have been lawful and retained as normal under the rules at the time. After the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act, they would have had to be destroyed within a specified period of time.\n\nThe DNA Database's indefinite retention policy was abolished by the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act. Before that, a test case was filed by two claimants from Sheffield, Mr. S. and Michael Marper, both of whom had fingerprint records and DNA profiles held in the database. S and Marper were supported by the Liberty and Privacy International, non-profit pressure groups who were permitted to make amicus brief submissions to the court.\n\nS. was a minor, at 11 years old, when he was arrested and charged with attempted robbery on 19 January 2001; he was acquitted a few months later, on 14 June 2001. Michael Marper was arrested on 13 March 2001, and charged with harassment of his partner; the charge was not pressed because Marper and his partner became reconciled before a pretrial review had taken place.\n\nIn November 2004 the Court of Appeal held that the keeping of samples from persons charged, yet not convicted - i.e. S and Marper - was lawful. However, an appeal was made to the European Court of Human Rights and the case was heard on 27 February 2008. On 4 December 2008, 17 judges unanimously ruled that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which refers to a person's right to a private life, and awarded €42,000 each to the appellants. The judges said keeping the information \"could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society\".\n\nIn response to this the Home Office announced in May 2009 a consultation on how they would comply with the ruling. The Home Office proposed to continue retaining indefinitely the DNA profiles of anyone convicted of any recordable offence, but to remove other profiles from the database after a period of time - generally 6 or 12 years, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The practice of taking DNA profiles upon arrest was not affected by the decision. On April 2010 the Crime and Security Act 2010 established that DNA profiles and fingerprints of anyone convicted of a recordable offence would be stored permanently, while those obtained on arrest, even when no conviction follows, would be stored for 6 years, renewable on new arrests.\n\nOn 18 May 2011 the UK supreme court also ruled, by a majority, that the ACPO DNA retention guidelines at the time were unlawful because they were incompatible with article 8 of the ECHR. However, not wishing to step on the toes of Parliament discussing the same issue, they granted no other relief.\n\nFinally on 1 May 2012 the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 received Royal Assent. This act allowed the police to retain fingerprint and DNA data on NDNAD indefinitely for most people convicted of a recordable crime. Those not charged or not found guilty must have their DNA data deleted within a specified period of time.\n\nThe UK DNA database is one of the world's largest, and has prompted concerns from some quarters as to its scope and usage. Recordable offences include begging, being drunk and disorderly and taking part in an illegal demonstration. \n\nThe use of the database for genetic research without consent has also been controversial, as has the storage of DNA samples and sensitive information by the commercial companies which analyse them for the police.\n\nGiven the privacy issues, but set against the usefulness of the database in identifying offenders, some have argued for a system whereby the encrypted data associated with a sample is held by a third, trusted, party and is only revealed if a crime scene sample is found to contain that DNA. Such an approach has been advocated by the inventor of genetic fingerprinting, Alec Jeffreys.\n\nOthers have argued that there should be time limits on how long DNA profiles can be retained on the Database, except for people convicted of serious violent or sexual offences. \"GeneWatch UK\" has launched a campaign calling on people to reclaim their DNA if they have not been charged or convicted of a serious offence, and has called for more safeguards to prevent misuse of the database. The Human Genetics Commission has argued that individuals' DNA samples should be destroyed after the DNA profiles used for identification purposes have been obtained.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats believed that innocent people's DNA should not be held on the database indefinitely. They launched a national online petition arguing that whilst they believe \"DNA is a vital tool in the fight against crime, there was no legitimate reason for the police to retain for life the DNA records of innocent people.\" They revealed figures in November 2007 showing that nearly 150,000 children under the age of 16 have their details on the database.\n\nThe Conservative Party objected to the database on the grounds that Parliament had not been given the opportunity to vote on it. Damian Green, former Tory home affairs spokesman, issued a press release in January 2006 stating: \"We do have concerns about the Government including on the database the DNA and fingerprints of completely innocent people... If the Government wants a database which has the details of everyone, not just criminals, they should be honest about it and not construct it by stealth.\" Mr Green had his own DNA profile on the database for a time having been arrested and subsequently released without charge on 27 November 2008.\n\nA YouGov poll published on 4 December 2006, indicated that 48% of those interviewed disapproved of keeping DNA records of those who have not been charged with any crime, or who have been acquitted, with 37% in favour.\n\nIn early 2007, five civil servants were arrested on charges of industrial espionage for allegedly stealing DNA information from the database and using it to establish a rival firm.\n\nIn 2009 the Home Office consulted on plans to extend the period of DNA retention to twelve years for serious crimes and six years for other crimes. According to the official figures, enough searches (around 2.5 trillion by 2009) had been run on the NDNAD such that statistically at least two matches (a 1 in a trillion chance, under ideal conditions) should have arisen by chance. However, depending on factors such as the number of incomplete profiles and the presence of related individuals, the chance matches might actually be higher. However the official position was that no chance matches have occurred, a position backed up by the fact that the majority of the searches would have been repeated, and that there are not 1 trillion unique DNA profiles on file.\n\nIn July 2009, a lawyer, Lorraine Elliot, was arrested on accusations of forgery which were quickly proven to be false. A DNA sample was taken from her and logged. She was cleared of the accusations a day later and exonerated. However, Mrs Elliot subsequently lost her job (even though she was completely innocent of any crime) when the fact that her DNA profile was stored on the national database was discovered during a subsequent work-related security check. In 2010 she was finally able to have her details removed from the database.\n\nCensus data and Home Office statistics indicated that by 2007 almost 40% of black men had their DNA profile on the database compared to 13% of Asian men and 9% of white men.\n\nIn July 2006, the Black Police Association called for an inquiry into why the database held details of 37% of black men but fewer than 10% of white men.\n\nIn November 2006, similar concerns were raised by \"the Sunday Telegraph\" which claimed that three in four young black men were on the DNA database.\n\nAccording to \"the Sunday Telegraph,\" an estimated 135,000 black males aged 15 to 34 would have been added to the DNA database by April 2007, equivalent to 77 percent of the young black male population in England and Wales.\n\nBy contrast, only 22 per cent of young white males, and six per cent of the general population, would be on the database.\n\nThis figure was confirmed by the British Government’s own Human Genetics Commission 2009 report on the topic, titled \"Nothing to hide, nothing to fear? Balancing individual rights and the public interest in the governance and use of the National DNA Database,\" which said that \"the profiles of over three quarters of young black men between the ages of 18 and 35 are recorded.\" \n\nOne explanation for the racial disparities is racial bias towards certain demographics, as evidenced by the reaction of the then chair of the home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz MP, in August 2009 who said that \"Such disparity in the treatment of different ethnic groups is bound to lead to a disintegration of community relations and a lack of trust in the police force.\"\n\nThese allegations have been refuted by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which used to run the National DNA database. According to the NPIA, the database is a successful tool in fighting crime and points out that \"between April 09 and 28th January 2010 the National DNA Database produced 174 matches to murder, 468 to rapes and 27,168 to other crime scenes.\" \n\nIn addition, the NPIA says that the ¨National¨ DNA Database continues to provide police with the most effective tool for the prevention and detection of crime since the development of fingerprint analysis over 100 years ago. Since 1998, more than 300,000 crimes have been detected with the aid of the Database, reassuring the public that offenders are more likely to be brought to justice.\" \n\nProfiles retained on the DNA Database by ethnic appearance as of 2015 were; 76% White North European, 2.1% White South European, 7.5% black, 5.2% Asian, 0.8% Middle Eastern, 0.6% Chinese, Japanese or South East Asian, and 8.0% unknown.\n\nThe idea of expanding the database to cover the entire UK population has drawn some support as well strong criticism from experts such as the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, but been rejected for the moment by the UK government as impractical and problematic for civil liberties. Supporters included Lord Justice Sedley and some police officers, and Tony Blair said in 2006 that he could see no reason why the DNA of everyone should not ultimately be kept on record. Opponents of the expansion include Reclaim Your DNA, backed by No2ID, GeneWatch and Liberty among others. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said in 2007 that a database for every man, woman and child in the country was \"a chilling proposal, ripe for indignity, error and abuse\".\n\n\n"}

His peerage was attainted in 1691 after the defeat. MacCarthy went into exile to the Netherlands, where he lived for some time on the tiny island of Rottumeroog, and in Germany near Hamburg where he died.\n\nDonough was born in 1668 at Blarney Castle. He was the only son of Callaghan MacCarty and his wife Elizabeth Fitzgerald. His father was from the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, an ancient Gaelic Irish family descended from the kings of Desmond. His father was the 3rd Earl of Clancarty. Donough's mother was from the FitzGerald dynasty an Old English family that came to Ireland during the Norman invasion of the country. She was a daughter of George FitzGerald, 16th Earl of Kildare, and Lady Joan Boyle. Both parents were Protestant, but his father had been originally been Catholic. His parents had married before 1641.\n\nDonough appears below as the younger of the two siblings:\n\nHis father died in 1676 when he was eight years old. He succeeded as the 4th Earl of Clancarty and inherited his father's massive Irish estates in County Cork and County Kerry. Clancarty's upbringing became a matter of high policy. His mother, one of the few protestants in the family, brought him to England and placed him under the tutelage of John Fell, Bishop of Oxford, for a Protestant education. His mother remarried to Sir William Davys, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.\n\nHowever, neither his mother nor the bishop could match the influence of his uncle Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel, who was one of the closest advisers of the Duke of York, the future James II. They convinced King Charles II to provide a royal letter, countersigned by Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, then the principal Secretary of State in England, inviting Clancarty to the Palace of Whitehall for the 1684 Christmas celebrations where, with Justin's connivance, Clancarty was married to Sunderland's daughter Elizabeth Spencer (1671–1704). However, reports that they married on 30 October 1684.\n\nThe couple were sixteen and thirteen years old respectively. The couple soon separated and the marriage was not consummated until many years later.\n\nWhen James II landed in Kinsale on 12 March 1689, he was received by Clancarty in the house he had there. Clancarty then raised a regiment of foot for James II. During the Siege of Derry he marched his regiment up from Munster to Derry where he arrived on 28 June 1689. He then led a daring night attack against the Butchers Gate immediately on the evening of his arrival. The besieged were surprised and the attackers were able to come up against the gate and touch it but were eventually thrown back.\n\nHe was taken prisoner at the Siege of Cork in 1690 and held in the Tower of London. He was outlawed and attainted in Ireland by the Williamites on 11 May 1691, forfeiting his titles and losing his estates.\n\nHe escaped from the Tower of London in 1694 and fled to James II's court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\n\nHe returned to England in the new year 1698 and sought out his wife Elizabeth to finally begin their married life, only to be turned in to the authorities by his brother in law, Lord Spencer, who had been alerted by the family servants. The case raised a public furore and William III, who did not take the matter seriously, said that he had never been bothered so much over anything so trivial as the affair of \"that little spark Clancarty\". Months later, MacCarthy was permitted to flee to exile on the continent, accompanied by his wife. Most of his estates were appropriated by the king's main adviser, the Dutchman Hans Willem Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland.\n\nThe couple settled down in Hamburg-Altona and Lübeck. In 1702 they were living in the 'Irish house' close to the Altona sawmill. The following year MacCarthy bought a small tavern near the fishing village of Blankenese on the northern shore of the Elbe estuary, and in 1706 he bought the island and seigneurie of Rottumeroog, in the Netherlands, where he lived with his libertine household until it was washed away by the Christmas flood of 1717. From then on, he spent the winters elsewhere, but returned to the island each summer time until he sold it in 1731. In 1723 he acquired a tiny country house in Oudwoude in Friesland. The assertion that he bought the house from Archibald Campbell, 10th Earl of Argyll is not supported by contemporary documents. In 1729 the anti-Orangist statesman Evert Joost Lewe allowed him to live at Elmersma, a manor house in the village of Hoogkerk near Groningen, without paying rent.\n\nThey had two sons:\n\nand a daughter:\n\nMacCarthy was a typical adventurer, crossing the Wadden Sea on his yacht and making a living by plundering shipwrecks and gathering washed-up merchandise. The authorities disapproved his methods and suspected him of supporting the Jacobite cause. He was commonly known as 'the crazy earl'. In 1721 he visited London and was restored to his former titles, but without getting back his estates.\n\nA carefully orchestrated story of his successful enterprises was published in 1732. It prompted the myth told to his former countrymen that he owned a large manor near Hamburg. Actually, he died in 1734 in Prahlenhof near Hamburg-St. Pauli, leaving severe debts leading to a bankruptcy sale.\n\nMacCarthy and his wife, who died in 1704, had two sons, Robert MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry and Justin MacCarty, who served as an officer in the Neapolitan army, as well as one daughter, Charlotte, who married John West, 1st Earl De La Warr.\n\nHe died on 1 October 1734 at the Prahlenhof near in Hamburg-St. Pauli, Germany.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152179", "title": "Ayacucho Quechua", "text": "Ayacucho Quechua\n\nAyacucho (also called Chanca or Chanka) after the former Chankas local tribe that dominated the area before Incan conquest is a variety of Southern Quechua spoken in the Ayacucho Region, Peru, as well as by immigrants from Ayacucho in Lima. With roughly a million speakers, it is the largest variety of Southern Quechua after Cusco Quechua. The literary standard of Southern Quechua is based on these two closely related Quechua varieties.\n\nSpanish Loanwords\n\nAyacucho Quechua has three vowels: , , and , which are rendered by native speakers as , , and respectively. When these vowels appear adjacent to the uvular fricative , they are lowered (with instead being produced further back), yielding , , and respectively. In bilingual speakers, the Spanish realizations , , and may also be found.\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Ayacucho Quechua are outlined below. Orthographic symbols at odds with the IPA are given in angle brackets.\n\n\nNotable differences from Cusco Quechua:\n\nAyacucho Quechua has borrowed hundreds of words from Spanish, and some speakers (even monolinguals) approximate the Spanish pronunciation. For such speakers, are phonemes in borrowed words like \"libru\" (from Spanish \"libro\" \"book\") or \"serbey\" (from Spanish \"servir\" \"to serve\")\n\nQuechua primary (strong) stress regularly falls on the penultimate syllable (if a word has more than one syllable). It may also occur on the final syllable, in which case it is directly indicated by the acute diacritic. In slow speech, weak stress tends to fall on the first syllable of a word.\n\nAll phonemes appear in word initial position, though vowel clusters are not allowed, and word initial consonant clusters occur only in words borrowed from Spanish (these clusters are \"bl\"-, \"br\"-, \"bw\"-, \"by\"-, \"pl\"-, \"pr\"-, \"pw\"-, \"py\"-, \"dy\", \"dr\"-, \"ty\"-, \"tr\"-, \"gr\"-, \"gl\"-, \"gw\"-, \"kr\"-, \"kl\"-, \"kw\"-, \"fr\"-, \"fl\"-, \"sp\"-, \"sk\"-, \"st\"-, \"sw\"- and \"sy\"-). The consonants \"h\", \"l\", and \"ñ\" cannot occur in word-final position (as well as borrowed Spanish consonants \"b\", \"g\", and \"f\"). This leads to a minimal possible syllable of V (only word initially) and a maximal native syllable of CVC \"ñan\" (with the prohibited consonants unable to appear in the final position), and a maximal possible syllable of CCVC \"kreyey\" (from Spanish \"creer\" \"to believe\").\n\nQuechua is a largely agglutinative language and nouns can be modified by many affixes (mostly suffixes) which can mark the case of a noun or derive a new word. Some suffixes are possible in combination, such as \"-pa\" + \"-ta\", \"ñuqapata\", \"to my place\". Pronouns are marked with the same suffixes as regular nouns, as in \"-ñuqa\" \"I\", \"-ñuqa-pa\" \"my\".\n\nThe first person plural pronouns Ayacucho Quechua are divided into inclusive and exclusive pairs. \"Ñuqanchik\", the inclusive pronoun, means \"we\" and includes the person to whom the speaker is talking, as in \"you and I\". The exclusive pronoun, \"ñuqayku\", also means \"we\", but does not include the listener, meaning approximately \"we but not you\".\n\nAyacucho Quechua substantives are marked for eleven grammatical cases, which are also conveyed through the use of suffixes. These suffixes may be placed onto nouns, numerals, pronouns, and—with an adverbial meaning—on adjectives and adverbs.\n\n\nIn contrast to the fairly simple morphology for nouns, Quechua verbal morphology is much more complex. Verbs are conjugated for person and number of both the subject and the object. Subject suffixes precede explicit object suffixes as in \"riku-y-ki-ku\" \"We see you\", in which the first person \"-y\" appears before the second person \"-ki\" (\"ku\", in this case pluralizes the first person). However, even the subject markers are preceded by the suffixes \"-wa\" and \"-su\" which indirectly convey the direct object of the verb, as in \"riku-wa-n-ki\" \"You see me\". Explicit personal markers are preceded by one of the tentatively titled \"aspect\" morphemes. The simple present tense is marked by the suffix \"-n-\", apart from first-person subject and second-person object, where there is no suffix.\n\n\nBelow is shown the verb \"rikuy\", \"to see\", fully conjugated in the simple present tense. The persons are shown accompanied by their coirresponding Quechua pronouns declined into the appropriate cases. Blocks which are left empty are either instances in which the object is the same as the subject, which requires the reflexive marker -\"ku\"-, as in \"riku-ku-y\" \"I saw myself\", or cases where such a statement is logically impossible, as in the intersection between a second person subject and a first person plural inclusive object, which would mean, approximately \"You helped you and I\".\n\nAyacucho Quechua has a standard SOV word order, as in \"(pay) wasitam ruwachkan\" \"he is building a house\", but this can be inverted, since the syntactic relationship between nouns is made clear by the overt case markers. However, unlike in other casemarked languages (like Russian or Latin), the inversion of the standard word order in Ayacucho Quechua does not serve to topicalize the word (or phrase) in question since this too is explicitly marked by the \"-qa\" discourse topic marker. Primarily then, inversions of word order serve to emphasize words as particularly relevant or salient (particularly verbs). Compare standard \"wasita qawan\" \"he watches the house\" with \"qawan wasita\" \"he watches the house\" (as opposed to feeling it or hearing about it) in which the act of watching is being specifically highlighted.\n\nWith respect to smaller constituents, the order is much more fixed. Modifiers, such as adjectives, preadjectivals, adverbials and attributive nouns all occur before the head which they modify (including possessive nouns marked with \"-pa\"). Prepositions, when they occur, are also placed before their noun phrases.\n\n\n"}

It also contains the landmark 1937 Tumacácori Museum building, also a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe first Spanish Colonial Jesuit missions in the locale were established in 1691, Mission San Cayetano de Tumacácori (at Tumacácori) and Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi, are the two oldest missions in southern Arizona. The Franciscan church of Mission San José de Tumacácori, across the river from and replacing Mission San Cayetano de Tumacácori, was built in the 1750s. The third mission was established in 1756, Mission San Cayetano de Calabazas.\nThe Mission San José de Tumacácori complex is open to the public. Nearby are the park's visitor center and the Tumacácori Museum in a historic Mission Revival style building. The Guevavi and Calabazas missions are not open to the general public, but can be visited on reserved tours led by park staff.\n\nThe Tumacácori missions complex was originally protected as Tumacácori National Monument, in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1990 the national monument was redesignated a National Historical Park. The Guevavi and Calabazas mission units were added to the Tumacácori missions complex unit, within the new Tumacácori National Historical Park.\n\nThe site was on the route of the 1775-1776 Juan Bautista de Anza Expedition from New Spain to Alta California, the first Spanish overland expedition to claimed but un-colonized upper Las Californias territory. A segment of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail lies along the Santa Cruz River between Tumacácori National Historical Park and Tubac Presidio State Historic Park.\n\nMission San José de Tumacácori was established in 1691 by Jesuit padre Eusebio Kino in a different nearby location. It was established one day before Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi, making it the oldest Jesuit mission site in southern Arizona. The first mission was named Mission San Cayetano de Tumacácori, established at an existing native O'odham or Sobaipuri settlement on the east side of the Santa Cruz River.\n\nAfter the Pima rebellion of 1751, the mission was moved to the present site on the west side of the Santa Cruz River and renamed San José de Tumacácori. By 1848, the mission was abandoned and began falling into severe disrepair. In 1854 it became a part of the U.S. Arizona Territory, after the Gadsden Purchase.\n\nRestoration and stabilization efforts began in 1908 when the site was declared Tumacácori National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1990 it became part of the new Tumacácori National Historical Park.\n\nTumacácori Museum was built in 1937 within what was then Tumacácori National Monument and is now Tumacácori National Historical Park. Designed by Scofield Delong, it contains interpretative displays relating to three historic missions preserved within the park, and includes artwork created by artist Herbert A. Collins.\n\nThe museum building, a fine example of Mission Revival style architecture, with Spanish Colonial Revival details, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.\n\nMovies with scenes filmed in the park include:\n\n\n\n "}

Concerning vocabulary, Cusco Quechua is closest to Ayacucho Quechua, with which it has 96% lexical similarity, whereas Puno Quechua and the Bolivian Quechua varieties have borrowed more lexicon and morphology from Aymara and Spanish (e.g. the diminutive suffix \"-ita, -itu, -sita, -situ\" instead of \"-cha\": cf. \"small stone\": \"rumisitu\" in Bolivia vs. \"rumicha\" in both Cusco and Ayacucho).

She is a member of the Committee for the Basic Law of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) since 1997 and the chairman of the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) since 2015.\n\nAs a successful politician early on, Tam was a member of the four different levels of representative councils, Executive Council, Legislative Council, Urban Council and Central and Western District Board in colonial Hong Kong in the 1980s. She was also a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee and took up various appointments from the Beijing government after she departed from the colonial government over the conflict of interest scandal in 1991.\n\nSince 1997, she has become one of the most recognisable spokesmen and \"most loyal mouthpieces\" for the Beijing authorities on constitutional matters such as the interpretations of the Basic Law and constitutional reforms, in which she has always firmly stood and defended Beijing's controversial decisions.\n\nTam was born on 2 November 1945 in Hong Kong to Tam Chung, a senior police officer. She graduated from the St. Paul's Co-educational College before she obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the University of London and her admission as a barrister at the Gray's Inn.\n\nShe first stepped into politics when she ran in the 1979 Urban Council election as an advocate for women's rights. She was elected with more than 5,000 votes, the third ranked in the election behind veteran Urban Councillors Elsie Elliott and Denny Huang. She was soon be appointed to sit on the Legislative Council in 1981. She was one of the recipients of the Ten Outstanding Young Persons Award and was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1982. She became the appointed member of the Central and Western District Board when the board was first created in 1982 under the district administration reform by Governor Murray MacLehose. She became a member of four different levels of representative councils in Hong Kong when she was appointed to the Executive Council, the top advisory body in the colonial government in 1983.\n\nDuring her era the Sino-British negotiations over the Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997 took place. She was one of the members of the delegation of the unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (UMELC) led by Sir Chung Sze-yuen to London and Beijing to lobby for the interests of the Hong Kong people. In December 1984 when she met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, she raised the question of the proposed Sino-British Joint Declaration and the \"possible incompatibility between the Chinese constitution and the basic law\", especially the protection of human rights.\n\nShe was appointed by the Beijing government to sit on the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee in 1985 which was responsible for the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the mini-constitution of the post-1997 Hong Kong. She was also awarded an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1985, and a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1988.\n\nShe was the founder of the Federation of Women Lawyers and the Junior Police Officers' Association. As the colonial government intended to introduce greater representative democracy in the transition period, Tam also founded the Progressive Hong Kong Society (PHKS) in 1985 to participate in the elections. The Progressive Hong Kong Society became the backbone of the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong (LDF) set by the a group of conservative business and professional elites in 1990 for the preparation of the first direct election of the Legislative Council in 1991, of which she became the vice-chairman of the new party.\n\nHowever, Tam's political career seemed to come to an end when she was found to be in a potential conflict of interest as she was involved in her family's taxi company while also being a member and former chairman of the Transport Advisory Committee. Although she eventually abandoned her shares in the company under pressure, she was not re-appointed by Governor David Wilson in the Executive and Legislative Councils after the incident. A new set of guidelines was also introduced requiring members of the councils to declare their business interests.\n\nAfter her departure from the colonial government, she found favour from the Beijing authorities. She accepted various appointments in the run up to 1997, including to the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR, and as a Hong Kong Affairs Advisor and member of the Selection Committee. She was elected to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) installed by Beijing. She subsequently resigned from the PLC to take a seat on the Basic Law Committee of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) in 1997. In that capacity, Tam became one of the most loyal mouthpieces of the Beijing authorities on legal matters, especially in defence of controversial interpretations of the Basic Law and in the constitutional reform debate after 1997.\n\nIn 1997, she led the Liberal Democratic Federation to merge with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA), another pro-business pro-Beijing party. In 2005 when the Progressive Alliance was merged into the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), Tam became the party vice-chairman from 2005 to 2007. She also held various public positions at the time, such as member of the Urban Renewal Authority and the Airport Authority Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the highly controversial national security legislation of the Basic Law Article 23 which later caused a record number of more than 500,000 people demonstration on 1 July 2003, Tam supported the government's decision to pass the bill. She even said that anyone who did not support the Article 23 legislation was not fit to be Chinese. In the constitutional reform debates in 2005 and 2010, Tam led the opposition against the pro-democrats' demand for the universal suffrage of Chief Executive and Legislative Council and defended the government's proposals.\n\nIn February 2006, Tam joined the board of subsequently Hong Kong-listed mainland Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Limited, one of the world's largest paperboard manufacturers, whose conditions for workers at its plants were sharply criticised in the 2008 human rights report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China and by Hong Kong's Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM).\n\nTam became the convenor of National People's Congress Hong Kong delegation from March 2013. On the matter of the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive, Tam said the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights indicated that the right to be elected is not universal. She also suggested that an interpretation of the Basic Law by Beijing could be the last option for determining how universal suffrage could be implemented for the 2017 Chief Executive election. In the 2014 constitutional reform debate, Tam actively opposed the pro-democrats' campaign for the \"public nomination\" of the Chief Executive, saying that was against the Basic Law, which states that candidates shall be put forward by a nominating committee. She received the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM), the highest award under the HKSAR honours and awards system, on 1 July 2013.\n\nIn 2015, Tam was appointed chairman of the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. Under her spell, high-flying head of investigations Rebecca Li Bo-lan was controversially sacked. The sudden dismissal came during Li's enquiry into possible impropriety relating to a $50 million payment made to Leung Chun-ying.\n\nIn 2017, Tam was the founding president of the Junior Police Officers’ Association fund which raised over HK$10 million for the families of the seven police officers who were convicted and jailed for two years for beating activist Ken Tsang Kin-chiu at the height of the Occupy protests in 2014.\n\n\n"}

The site commemorates the Whitmans, their role in establishing the Oregon Trail, and the challenges encountered when two cultures meet.\n\nIn 1836, a small group of Methodist missionaries traveled with the annual fur trapper's caravan into \"Oregon Country\". Among the group, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding became the first white women to travel across the continent.\n\nMarcus Whitman and his wife Narcissa Whitman established the Whitman Mission at Waiilatpu, near the Walla Walla River. The mission was in the Cayuse territory. The Cayuse were a warring tribe and were suspicious of the Whitmans. Relations between the Whitmans and the Cayuse improved greatly when Marcus Whitman attempted to learn the Cayuse language. While Dr. Whitman had learned the Cayuse language he was insistent that the Cayuse should learn the white mans way of living by becoming farmers. Differences in culture led to growing tensions between the native Cayuse people and the Whitmans.\nThe Mission became an important stop along the Oregon Trail from 1843-1847, and passing immigrants added to the tension. With the influx of white settlers the Cayuse became suspicious of the Whitmans again, fearing that the white man was coming to take the land.\n\nA measles outbreak in November 1847 killed half the local Cayuse. The measles also broke out in the Mission but more white settlers survived. Some of the Cayuse blamed the devastation of their tribe on Dr. Whitman and Mrs. Whitman. They were killed along with eleven others; forty-seven other mission residents were taken hostage. The deaths of the Whitmans shocked the country, prompting Congress to make Oregon a U.S. territory, and precipitated the Cayuse War.\n\nIn more recent times, the site has been excavated for important artifacts, and then reburied. A memorial obelisk, erected fifty years after the event, stands on a nearby hill.\n\nThe historic site was established in 1936 as Whitman National Monument and was redesignated a National Historic Site on January 1, 1963.\n\n"}

It is distributed under the MIT License.\n\nFreeRTOS is designed to be small and simple. The kernel itself consists of only three C files. To make the code readable, easy to port, and maintainable, it is written mostly in C, but there are a few assembly functions included where needed (mostly in architecture-specific scheduler routines).\n\nFreeRTOS provides methods for multiple threads or tasks, mutexes, semaphores and software timers. A tick-less mode is provided for low power applications. Thread priorities are supported. FreeRTOS applications can be completely statically allocated. Alternatively RTOS objects can be dynamically allocated with five schemes of memory allocation provided: \nThere are none of the more advanced features typically found in operating systems like Linux or Microsoft Windows, such as device drivers, advanced memory management, user accounts, and networking. The emphasis is on compactness and speed of execution. FreeRTOS can be thought of as a 'thread library' rather than an 'operating system', although command line interface and POSIX-like I/O abstraction add-ons are available.\n\nFreeRTOS implements multiple threads by having the host program call a thread tick method at regular short intervals. The thread tick method switches tasks depending on priority and a round-robin scheduling scheme. The usual interval is 1/1000 of a second to 1/100 of a second, via an interrupt from a hardware timer, but this interval is often changed to suit a particular application.\n\nThe download contains prepared configurations and demonstrations for every port and compiler, allowing rapid application design. The FreeRTOS.org site also contains a lot of documentation and RTOS tutorials (additional manuals and tutorials are available for a fee), as well as details of the RTOS design.\n\n\nAmazon provides an extension of FreeRTOS, referred to as \"a:FreeRTOS\". This is FreeRTOS with libraries for IOT support, specifically for Amazon Web Services. Since version 10.0.0 in 2017, Amazon has taken stewardship of the FreeRTOS code, including any updates to the original kernel.\n\nSAFERTOS was developed as a complementary version of FreeRTOS, with common functionality but designed specifically for safety-critical implementation. FreeRTOS was subjected to HAZOP, and weaknesses were identified and resolved. The result was put through a full IEC 61508 SIL 3 development life cycle, the highest level for a software-only component.\n\nSAFERTOS was developed by WITTENSTEIN High Integrity Systems, in partnership with Real Time Engineers Ltd, primary developer of the FreeRTOS project. Both SAFERTOS and FreeRTOS share the same scheduling algorithm, have similar APIs, and are otherwise very similar, but they were developed with differing objectives. SAFERTOS was developed solely in the C language to meet requirements for certification to IEC61508.\n\nSAFERTOS can reside solely in the on-chip read only memory of a microcontroller for standards compliance. When implemented in hardware memory, SAFERTOS code can only be utilized in its original, already-certified, configuration. This means certification of systems do not need to re-test the kernel portion of their designs. SAFERTOS is included in the ROM of some Stellaris Microcontrollers from Texas Instruments. SAFERTOS source code does not need to be separately purchased. In this usage scenario, a C header file is used to map SAFERTOS API functions to their location in read-only memory. \n\nOPENRTOS is a commercially-licensed version of Amazon FreeRTOS, sold by WITTENSTEIN High Integrity Systems.

Thin-layer chromatography is performed on a sheet of glass, plastic, or aluminium foil, which is coated with a thin layer of adsorbent material, usually silica gel, aluminium oxide (alumina), or cellulose. This layer of adsorbent is known as the stationary phase.\n\nAfter the sample has been applied on the plate, a solvent or solvent mixture (known as the mobile phase) is drawn up the plate via capillary action. Because different analytes ascend the TLC plate at different rates, separation is achieved. The mobile phase has different properties from the stationary phase. For example, with silica gel, a very polar substance, non-polar mobile phases such as heptane are used. The mobile phase may be a mixture, allowing chemists to fine-tune the bulk properties of the mobile phase.\n\nAfter the experiment, the spots are visualized. Often this can be done simply by projecting ultraviolet light onto the sheet; the sheets are treated with a phosphor, and dark spots appear on the sheet where compounds absorb the light impinging on a certain area. Chemical processes can also be used to visualize spots; anisaldehyde, for example, forms colored adducts with many compounds, and sulfuric acid will char most organic compounds, leaving a dark spot on the sheet.\n\nTo quantify the results, the distance traveled by the substance being considered is divided by the total distance traveled by the mobile phase. (The mobile phase must not be allowed to reach the end of the stationary phase.) This ratio is called the retardation factor (R). In general, a substance whose structure resembles the stationary phase will have low R, while one that has a similar structure to the mobile phase will have high retardation factor. Retardation factors are characteristic, but will change depending on the exact condition of the mobile and stationary phase. For this reason, chemists usually apply a sample of a known compound to the sheet before running the experiment.\n\nThin-layer chromatography can be used to monitor the progress of a reaction, identify compounds present in a given mixture, and determine the purity of a substance. Specific examples of these applications include: analyzing ceramides and fatty acids, detection of pesticides or insecticides in food and water, analyzing the dye composition of fibers in forensics, assaying the radiochemical purity of radiopharmaceuticals, or identification of medicinal plants and their constituents \n\nA number of enhancements can be made to the original method to automate the different steps, to increase the resolution achieved with TLC and to allow more accurate quantitative analysis. This method is referred to as HPTLC, or \"high-performance TLC\". HPTLC typically uses thinner layers of stationary phase and smaller sample volumes, thus reducing the loss of resolution due to diffusion.\n\nTLC plates are usually commercially available, with standard particle size ranges to improve reproducibility. They are prepared by mixing the adsorbent, such as silica gel, with a small amount of inert binder like calcium sulfate (gypsum) and water. This mixture is spread as a thick slurry on an unreactive carrier sheet, usually glass, thick aluminum foil, or plastic. The resultant plate is dried and \"activated\" by heating in an oven for thirty minutes at 110 °C. The thickness of the absorbent layer is typically around 0.1 – 0.25 mm for analytical purposes and around 0.5 – 2.0 mm for preparative TLC.\n\nThe process is similar to paper chromatography with the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different stationary phases. Because of its simplicity and speed TLC is often used for monitoring chemical reactions and for the qualitative analysis of reaction products. Plates can be labeled before or after the chromatography process using a pencil or other implement that will not interfere or react with the process.\n\nTo run a thin layer chromatography plate, the following procedure is carried out:\n\n\nDifferent compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase and because of differences in solubility in the solvent. By changing the solvent, or perhaps using a mixture, the separation of components (measured by the \"R\" value) can be adjusted. Also, the separation achieved with a TLC plate can be used to estimate the separation of a flash chromatography column. (A compound elutes from a column when the amount of solvent collected is equal to 1/R.) Chemists often use TLC to develop a protocol for separation by chromatography and use TLC to determine which fractions contain the desired compounds.\n\nSeparation of compounds is based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding sites on the stationary phase. For instance, if normal-phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase, it can be considered polar. Given two compounds that differ in polarity, the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is, therefore, better able to displace the mobile phase from the available binding sites. As a consequence, the less polar compound moves higher up the plate (resulting in a higher \"R\" value). If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents, it becomes better at binding to the polar plate and therefore displacing solutes from it, so all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate. It is commonly said that \"strong\" solvents (eluents) push the analyzed compounds up the plate, whereas \"weak\" eluents barely move them. The order of strength/weakness depends on the coating (stationary phase) of the TLC plate. For silica gel-coated TLC plates, the eluent strength increases in the following order: perfluoroalkane (weakest), hexane, pentane, carbon tetrachloride, benzene/toluene, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, 2-propanol/\"n\"-butanol, water, methanol, triethylamine, acetic acid, formic acid (strongest). For C18-coated plates the order is reverse. In other words, when the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is non-polar, the method is \"normal-phase\" as opposed to \"reverse-phase\". This means that if a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane as the mobile phase is used, adding more ethyl acetate results in higher \"R\" values for all compounds on the TLC plate. Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate. An eluotropic series can be used as a guide in selecting a mobile phase. If a reversed order of running of the compounds is desired, an apolar stationary phase should be used, such as C18-functionalized silica.\n\nAs the chemicals being separated may be colorless, several methods exist to visualize the spots:\n\nOnce visible, the \"R\" value, or retardation factor, of each spot can be determined by dividing the distance the product traveled by the distance the solvent front traveled using the initial spotting site as reference. These values depend on the solvent used and the type of TLC plate and are not physical constants.\n\nIn organic chemistry, reactions are qualitatively monitored with TLC. Spots sampled with a capillary tube are placed on the plate: a spot of starting material, a spot from the reaction mixture, and a cross-spot with both. A small (3 by 7 cm) TLC plate takes a couple of minutes to run. The analysis is qualitative, and it will show if the starting material has disappeared, i.e. the reaction is complete, if any product has appeared, and how many products are generated (although this might be underestimated due to co-elution). Unfortunately, TLCs from low-temperature reactions may give misleading results, because the sample is warmed to room temperature in the capillary, which can alter the reaction—the warmed sample analyzed by TLC is not the same as what is in the low-temperature flask. One such reaction is the DIBALH reduction of ester to aldehyde.\n\nIn one study TLC has been applied in the screening of organic reactions, for example in the fine-tuning of BINAP synthesis from 2-naphthol. In this method, the alcohol and catalyst solution (for instance iron(III) chloride) are placed separately on the base line, then reacted, and then instantly analyzed.\n\nA special application of TLC is in the characterization of radiolabeled compounds, where it is used to determine radiochemical purity. The TLC sheet is visualized using a sheet of photographic film or an instrument capable of measuring radioactivity. It may be visualized using other means as well. This method is much more sensitive than the others and can be used to detect an extremely small amount of a compound, provided that it carries a radioactive atom.\n\nSince different compounds will travel a different distance in the stationary phase, chromatography can be used to isolate components of a mixture for further analysis. The separated compounds each occupying a specific area on the plate, they can be scraped off (along with the stationary phase particles) and dissolved into an appropriate solvent. As an example, in the chromatography of an extract of green plant material (for example spinach) shown in 7 stages of development, Carotene elutes quickly and is only visible until step 2. Chlorophyll A and B are halfway in the final step and lutein the first compound staining yellow. Once the chromatography is over, the carotene can be removed from the plate, extracted into a solvent and placed into a spectrophotometer to determine its spectrum. The quantities extracted are small and a technique such as column chromatography is preferred to separate larger amounts. However, big preparative TLC plates with thick silica gel coatings can be used to separate more than 100 mg of material.\n\nTLC is also used for the identification of the completion of any chemical reaction. To determine this it is observed that at the beginning of a reaction the entire spot is occupied by the starting chemicals or materials on the plate. As the reaction starts taking place the spot formed by the initial chemicals starts reducing and eventually replaces the whole spot of starting chemicals with a new product present on the plate. The formation of an entirely new spot determines the completion of a reaction. \n\nFurthermore, two-dimensional TLC is frequently used as a method to check if a compound is stable in the stationary phase (such as silica gel, which is usually slightly acidic). For this purpose, the tested compound mixture is eluted twice in a square-shaped TLC plate, first in one direction and then rotated 90º. If the target compound appears on the diagonal of the square, it is stable in silica gel and safe to purify. If it appears below the diagonal, it is decomposing on silica gel. If this is the case, purification can be attempted using neutralized silica gel (with triethylamine, for example), or an alternative stationary phase such as neutral alumina.\n\n"}

KTWV is located in Los Angeles and broadcasts to the Greater Los Angeles area. Airing an Urban Adult Contemporary radio format branded as \"94.7 The Wave\", the station has studios on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles. Its transmitter is located on Mount Wilson.\n\nOn March 7, 1961, KLAC-FM first signed on the air. It served as an FM sister station to AM 570 KLAC, simulcasting its programming. KLAC AM & FM were purchased by Metromedia in 1963. By the mid-1960s, the FCC wanted FM sisters to AM stations to air separate programming; thus, KLAC-FM became an automated station, playing a mix of middle-of-the-road and big band music like other FM stations owned by Metromedia. In order to separate itself further from its AM sister, the station became KMET in 1968. \n\nMonths later, Tom Donahue convinced Metromedia to establish a freeform rock format on KMET in Los Angeles and KSFR in San Francisco (which then became KSAN) after a dispute with the owners of KPPC-FM. Donahue brought over most of those who went on strike at KPPC, including his LA tag team partner in ex-KFWB \"Swinging Gentleman\" B. Mitchel Reed. He had become enamored with the Underground Rock sound after attending the Monterey Pop Festival and shortly afterward bonded with fellow Top 40 veteran Donahue over their increasing unhappiness with AM radio and its restrictions. \n\nKMET became legendary and popular as \"The Mighty 'MET\" for its freeform style in letting DJs choose the music without genre restrictions and an irreverent, loose and laidback presentation of the music. In the early 1980s, however, Metromedia changed the presentation and sound of KMET to a more mainstream style. In the process, KMET quickly became a shell of its former self: playlists were tightened and hit-oriented, DJs became less personal in their presentation, and the station was heavily constructed by outside consultants.\n\nThis drove KMET's ratings down to the point of being well behind established AOR pioneer KLOS as well as behind KROQ-FM, a station that rose from the ashes of KPPC-FM to become the trademark radio home in L.A. for the New Wave and Punk scenes in the 80s. Then, in 1986, KMET got two new competitors that hurt the station irrevocably: KNAC, targeting younger listeners via the budding Heavy Metal genre that KMET wouldn't touch and more aggressively than KLOS and KROQ, and KLSX, targeting older listeners with the music that KMET made famous through the newly created Classic Rock genre. Both ate further into KMET's ratings immediately. \n\nAdditionally in 1986, Metromedia—which already sold off its TV stations (including KTTV) to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation—sold KMET and eight other stations for $250 million to a group of investors who rechristened the company Metropolitan Broadcasting (which had been Metromedia's original corporate name).\n\nThe new competition combined with the existing duo of KLOS and KROQ all drove KMET's ratings to a shocking low of 1.6 by January 1987. VP/GM Howard Bloom and program director Frank Cody considered retooling or tweaking the station's format again, to the point of hiring back KMET veterans including Jim Ladd with jock-friendly contracts and trying a modern rock-intensive approach targeting KROQ with a new \"94.7% New Rock\" slogan and identity. But in the end, research the station conducted came to the conclusion KMET had become too damaged and so the decision was made to pull the plug rather than another station retooling.\n\nOn February 6th, four days after making the decision, the entire KMET airstaff were summoned one by one to the Sheraton Premiere Hotel in Universal City where they were told by Bloom and Cody they were being let go and the station was changing formats. The last live jock on the air that day was morning man Paraquat Kelly. He got word of what has happening, and at the end of his shift played \"Beautiful Losers\" by Bob Seger (for his co-workers) and \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" by The Rolling Stones (for KMET itself). Choked with emotion, his last words were \"We all love you. Goodbye, Southern California. This is KMET, the Mighty 'MET.\" At that time, the station went jockless and automated while playing an ominous countdown to Noon on February 14, 1987 set to the opening bars of Tangerine Dream's \"Sunset Drive\".\n\nValentine's Day 1987 would be known as the \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" for L.A. rock fans. The last hour featured sentimental songs \"My Generation\" by The Who and \"You're All I've Got Tonight\" by The Cars, and California/LA-inspired songs \"L.A. Woman\" by The Doors and \"Hotel California\" by The Eagles wrapped around classic KMET IDs by Tom Donahue and B. Mitchel Reed. Nearly 19 years of rock came to an end with \"Funeral for a Friend\" by Elton John, \"Born to Run\" by Bruce Springsteen, and then the second half of the \"Abbey Road\" medley by The Beatles with \"Golden Slumbers\", \"Carry That Weight\" and then ending with (appropriately) \"The End\". \n\nThe fired KMET jocks were given the chance to give a full goodbye to listeners via on-air tributes from their former rivals KLOS and KLSX. They then were split between those two and KSCA, which would be launched by Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters that fall. KSCA and future eclectic rock station KSWD (which notably had multiple on-air tributes to KMET during its run) would both pay tribute to KMET's closing by themselves closing with \"Abbey Road\" with the former repeating KMET's closing (and signing off after playing the hidden finale \"Her Majesty\") and the latter playing all of Side 2 from \"Here Comes the Sun\" through \"The End\".\n\nSpeculation for the new format was between a first of its kind new age/contemporary jazz/soft rock hybrid format, or a dance-rock format in between KIIS-FM, KPWR and KROQ.\n\nIn the end, at Noon on Valentine's Day 1987, KMET indeed flipped to the New Age/jazz/soft rock hybrid format that eventually came to be called \"New Adult Contemporary\" (also known by the abbreviation \"NAC\") with the branding \"94.7 The Wave\" and new call letters KTWV. The first song on The Wave was the fittingly titled \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\" by Sting, followed by the first instrumental, \"Maputo\" by Bob James and David Sanborn.\n\nIn its initial 19 months, management referred to The Wave as a \"mood service\" rather than a \"radio station\"; the only live voices heard were those of personalities from Financial News Network doing news and traffic updates. In lieu of disc jockeys, listeners were encouraged to dial into a \"Wave Line\" to learn what the music being played was and the music was wrapped around pre-recorded vignettes called \"Playlets\" featuring \"ordinary people\" in unique situations (one of whom was voiced by Terry McGovern, coincidentally the former morning man on KSAN from 1974-79) that noted the time as part of the dialogue.\n\nThe launch of \"The Wave\" led to similarly-formatted stations in other markets like Santa Cruz/San Jose, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, San Diego, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, D.C. and New York, albeit with a more traditional presentation with jocks or announcers. Additionally, that fall, Metropolitan Broadcasting syndicated the \"Wave\" format via the Satellite Music Network to other markets including San Diego (as KSWV), Kansas City (as KCWV), Chicago (as WTWV), Detroit (as WVAE), and notably Cleveland (as WNWV). There also later was a station in Canada modeled entirely after KTWV, CIWV-FM in Hamilton, Ontario (which also served Toronto), used the moniker \"The Wave\" with a similar logo to KTWV on 94.7 FM. It ran from 2000 until 2011, when it flipped to a country format and \"The Wave\" was moved first to a webstream before launching on an HD Radio subchannel.\n\nHowever, ratings for the initial presentation were weaker than hoped, with the \"Playlets\" being limited to only the top of the hour by June. Eventually, Frank Cody left to be a radio consultant for budding NAC stations (and later coined the phrase \"smooth jazz\"), and John Sebastian (former programmer of KHJ, who had launched a similar sounding station in Washington, D.C.) was hired as the new program director. He promptly introduced a traditional presentation similar to other NAC stations, dropping the playlets entirely, expanding the playlist, and hiring live jocks who started on September 19, 1988. The core group of these included Don Burns, Talaya Trigueros, Keri Tombazian, Amy Hiatt and China Smith. The syndicated \"Wave\" then wound down (although it did copy \"The Wave\" in adding live jocks before this); only Cleveland has remained with the format under local operation (excluding from 2010 to 2011 when the format ran on an HD Radio subchannel of WNWV).\n\nIn the early/mid-1990s, like most NAC stations launched at the same as \"The Wave\", the station dropped New Age and Jazz fusion in favor of a blend of contemporary jazz and soft R&B/AC crossover hits under the smooth jazz label the format would become defined as going forward. Eventually, toward the 21st century, the same reasons that led KMET down ratings-wise (tight playlists formatted through consultants) would plague \"The Wave\" and other \"smooth jazz\" stations, although this would not be made clear until the adoption of the PPM ratings system in 2008. At that time, many of the stations that launched in KTWV's shadow flipped out of the format.\n\nIn February 2010, Jhani Kaye took over KTWV from the departing Paul Goldstein. Kaye, who previously programmed heritage AC station KOST, increased the amount of crossover vocals and dramatically reduced the number of instrumentals played (with most of the remaining being pop covers and basic originals) transitioning KTWV toward a smooth adult contemporary direction. In addition, references to \"smooth jazz\" were eliminated as the station reformatted to compete directly with KOST. With this, Don Burns (who voice-tracked from his home in Palm Springs) along with fellow original Wave air personality Keri Tombazian were both let go.\n\nKTWV's morning program is hosted by Pat Prescott. Between May 2010 and June 2012, Prescott co-hosted the show with Kim Amidon, a former morning DJ at KOST, replacing musician Brian McKnight (who had replaced saxophonist Dave Koz, who has a syndicated Smooth Jazz show of his own and a weekend show on Sirius XM's Watercolors channel). Prescott has co-hosted mornings since 2001.\n\nIn November 2013, the station introduced a revamped logo, still utilizing the 1987-era font while dumping the original \"Wave\" graphic, and changing their slogan from \"Southern California's Place to Unwind and Relax\" to just \"Smooth R&B.\" This change brought KTWV the second radio station to Urban AC when it brought the station high ratings for the first time in years to compete with KJLH (102.3 FM) both stations playing the format for the first time in history. In June 2014, KTWV saw the return of longtime Assistant PD Ralph Stewart, when he became Program Director and reintroduced some mainstream AC/pop crossovers into the playlist, and dropped the \"Smooth R&B\" slogan. In February 2015, after the flip of KHHT from rhythmic oldies to urban contemporary as KRRL \"Real 92.3\", KTWV added more classic soul and current R&B to fill the void of KHHT's departure, and adopted the new \"Soul of Southern California\" slogan, while also dropping most of the mainstream AC/pop crossovers, and to also further position KTWV against KJLH. This made it a softer version of Rhythmic Adult Contemporary. It also adopted a new logo that notably removed all remaining elements of the original \"Wave\" logo after three decades. These moves have seen KTWV's ratings improve further, putting the station among the Los Angeles market's top stations, including sister KRTH.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17.\n\nOn April 18, 2019, it was announced that original \"Wave\" jock Talaya Trigueros was leaving KTWV after 31 years in midday drive due to budget cuts. Trigueros, who originally began under just her first name, had been the last remaining jock from the original group hired by John Sebastian in 1988.\n\nThe current formats on KTWV's HD subchannels are:\n\n"}

The ride grew a following and is now one of the best known rides. Many installations also utilize a reverse-mounted camera that records passengers during their experience, typically available for purchase after completing the attraction.\n\nReverse bungee rides operate at amusement parks and as stand-along attractions. Due to the limited capacity of the attraction, most installations are an upcharge and require a separate admission from their respective park.\n\nReverse bungee rides are manufactured by several different companies. One of the most prominent is the SlingShot ride from Funtime of Australia. \n\nThe ride consists of two telescopic gantry towers mounted on a platform, feeding two elastic ropes down to a two-person passenger car constructed from an open sphere of tubular steel. The passenger car is secured to the platform with an electro-magnetic latch as the elastic ropes are stretched. When the electromagnet is turned off, the passenger car is catapulted vertically with a g-force of 3–5, reaching an altitude of between and .\n\nThe passenger sphere is free to rotate between the two ropes, giving the riders a chaotic and disorienting ride. After several bounces, the ropes are relaxed and the passengers are lowered back to the launch position.\n\nThe Slingshot manufactured by \"Funtime\" uses steel cables and a patented spring propulsion device rather than elastic ropes. It can use up to 720 specially designed springs, enabling the ride to propel passengers up to high at speeds up to 160 km per hour.\n\nIn August 1998, Jérôme Charron died in a reverse bungee ride accident at the Ottawa Exhibition in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada when he was hurled 40 m into the air before plummeting to his death as his harness had detached. In February 2000, the firm responsible for the ride, Anderson Ventures, was fined $145,000 for this incident.\n\nOrdinarily, the bungee cord is changed to adjust the body weight of different riders. The operator in Ottawa instead used a lead between the carabiner and the bungee cord for this purpose. Using a lead is faster than changing the cord, so more rides can be offered; however, using a lead is less safe than switching bungee cords. The problem occurs when the lead cord wraps around the carabiner, tightens and through friction undoes the twisting safety mechanism that keeps the carabiner locked. In this case, the operator was using dual carabiners. On the bounce back up, the lead cord tightened, causing both carabiners to open. This fact was discovered by the Ottawa Police who investigated the death. A video of the incident depicts it.\nProvincial inspectors had inspected the ride just 4 days before the incident and approved it, but did not see the lead because it was in a nearby box.\n\n"}

{"id": "2152244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152244", "title": "Evzones", "text": "Evzones\n\nThe Evzones or Evzonoi (, ), is the name of several historical elite light infantry and mountain units of the Greek Army. Today, it refers to the members of the Presidential Guard (), a ceremonial unit that guards the Greek Tomb of the Unknown Soldier () and the Presidential Mansion in Athens. An Evzone () is also known, colloquially, as a Tsoliás (; pl. , Τσολιάδες, Tsoliádes). Evzones are known for their distinctive uniform, which evolved from the clothes worn by the klephts who fought the Ottoman occupation of Greece. The most visible item of this uniform is the fustanella, a kilt-like garment. Their distinctive dress turned them into a popular image for the Greek soldier, especially among foreigners.\n\nThe word \"evzōnos\" () is first attested in Homer's \"Iliad\" and derives from and , meaning \"well-girt\". The word was used by ancient writers for centuries to describe light infantry light infantry (better known as \"psiloi\" or \"gymnitai\").\n\nThe term \"Evzones\" was revived in modern practice as a Greek version of the European-style light infantry (such as the German \"Jäger\", French \"Chasseurs\", or British Riflemen) in 1824 during the Greek War of Independence, when the first attempts to form a regular, European-style army were undertaken by the Greek rebels. The first regular infantry battalion comprised six companies, one of which was designated as an \"Evzone Company\" (Λόχος Εὐζώνων). \n\nThe uniform now associated with the Evzones was not used at the time; but a uniform derived from the traditional costume of the \"fustanella\", had already been adopted by the British-sponsored Greek Light Infantry Regiments raised during the Napoleonic Wars. A similar uniform was adopted when Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias reformed the nascent Hellenic Army in 1828 and formed the so-called \"Light Battalions\" (Ελαφρά Τάγματα)—five from Western Continental Greece and eight from Eastern Continental Greece—in an attempt to instil discipline and gradually regularize the irregular groups (\"klephts\") that had provided the bulk of the Greek forces during the War of Independence. The men of these battalions wore the traditional costume, although they were not designated as Evzones. Following the assassination of Kapodistrias in 1831 and the ensuing political infighting, the Light Battalions effectively disbanded, and their men became armed brigands under the command of the chieftains of the old irregular groups.\n\nIn 1833, after the arrival of King Otto () to Greece, the Hellenic Army was organized along new lines by the Bavarian officials who had come with Otto. In February 1833, the infantry was organized into eight regular infantry battalions, of 728 men and six companies each: one of grenadiers, four line infantry companies, and one light infantry company. The latter received the name \"Evzones\" (\"Voltigeurs\" in the Bavarian terminology), but their uniform was of European style, identical to the rest of the infantry, apart from the use of green as their distinctive colour in the piping, epaulettes and decoration of their uniforms.\nIn March 1833, ten independent battalions of light infantry (termed Ἀκροβολισταί, \"Skirmishers\", or Κυνηγοί, \"Hunters\" in Greek) of 204 men and four companies were established. However, because the \"tight\" European uniforms prescribed for these units were unpopular with many veterans of the War of Independence, recruitment remained very low. In the end, the attempt was given up and in 1836, four Light Infantry Battalions were formed instead, who were allowed to wear a uniform based on the traditional Greek dress. These battalions had six companies each, but with 162 men per company instead of the 120 men in the regular infantry battalions. In January 1838, the four Light Infantry Battalions were merged into two regular infantry battalions (while one of the original four line battalions was disbanded), and replaced by eight \"Mountain Guard\" battalions (Τάγματα Ὁροφυλακής). Assigned the role of border guards, the Mountain Guard battalions had four companies with 299 men and 16 officers. In February 1838, they were subordinated to three Mountain Guard Headquarters, commanded by a colonel or lieutenant colonel.\n\nIn another reorganization in 1843, the regular infantry battalions were reduced to two Line Infantry Battalions of eight companies (including one Evzone company) of 140 men each, and two Skirmisher Battalions of four companies each. At the same time, an additional three light companies were established, which in 1844 were amalgamated into the \"Supplementary Mountain Guard Corps\" (Παραπληρωματικό Σώμα Ὁροφυλακής). The entire Mountain Guard was then placed directly under the command of the Ministry of Military Affairs, abolishing the Mountain Guard Headquarters. In October 1852, the Mountain Guard was reorganized into four two-battalion regiments. \n\nIn August 1854, the Mountain Guard was disbanded and its units converted into three Skirmisher Battalions, while the regular infantry battalions were increased to six. In 1860, the infantry was homogenized into ten infantry battalions of six 120-man companies (one Evzone company), plus ten reserve battalions.\n\nOn 12 December 1868, King George I () signed a Royal Decree authorizing the creation of four independent (αὐθύπαρκτα) Evzone Battalions (Τάγματα Εὐζώνων), \"forming part of the Army's regular strength and intended especially for service on the frontier, and in providing assistance to the Gendarmerie.<ref name=\"ΒΔ 63/1868 Evzone Battalions\">Royal Decree of 12 December 1868, published in ΦΕΚ 63/1868, pp. 440–442</ref> Each battalion was to be commanded by a lieutenant colonel or a major, with a staff of 4 officers and 6 NCOs, and comprising four companies of 122 officers and men each. Their personnel were to be exclusively career and volunteer soldiers, rather than draftees. Prospective recruits had to be of good health and character, over 17 and under 40 years of age, and preferably unmarried. On the same day, due to the precarious security situation, the King also provisionally authorized the creation of eight further Evzone Battalions, numbered 5–12, as well as the increase of each Evzone company's strength to 170.<ref name=\"ΒΔ 62/1868\">Royal Decree of 12 December 1868, published in ΦΕΚ 62/1868, p. 430</ref> In addition, on the same day a special detachment, initially named \"Agema\" (Άγημα), the precursor of the modern Presidential Guard, composed of two Evzone infantry companies and a cavalry company, was formed.<ref name=\"ΒΔ 63/1868 Agema\">Royal Decree of 12 December 1868, published in ΦΕΚ 63/1868, pp. 438–440</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Eastern Crisis, in 1877 the Hellenic Army was reorganized, with two square infantry divisions being established. The 1st Evzone Battalion at Kravasaras was subordinated to the Patras Brigade, and the 2nd Evzone Battalion at Karpenisi to the Corfu Brigade, with the two brigades comprising the Peloponnese Division. The 3rd Evzone Battalion at Ypati was subordinated to the Athens Brigade, and the 2nd Evzone Battalion at Gardiki to the Missolonghi Brigade, with the two brigades comprising Continental Greece Division. \n\nThe 1878 reorganization greatly increased the size of the army, but the Evzone battalions remained the same, with a peacetime strength of 1,968 men (out of 10,400) and an intended wartime strength of 4,160 men (out of 21,000 men). In 1880, another reorganization increased the Evzone units to 11 independent battalions of four companies each, and one training battalion. However, the 1881 army regulations again revised the number to nine Evzone battalions. In 1885, during a reorganization of the infantry, the Evzone battalions of the active army were reduced to eight, but two reserve battalions were established. \n\nThe Hellenic Army was mobilized during the diplomatic crisis with the Ottoman Empire that followed the \"de facto\" annexation of Eastern Rumelia to the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885. In May 1886, clashes broke out between Greek and Ottoman troops in Thessaly, and at Koutra, 300 men of the 5th Evzone Battalion surrendered to the Turks. The two captains responsible for the Koutra incident were court-martialled and condemned to death in August 1887, although the death sentence was immediately commuted by the King.\n\nThe eight Evzone battalions were retained by to the 1887 regulations issued by the French military mission, but two of them were skeleton formations in peacetime, with only their professional personnel assigned to them.\n\nIn total, ten Evzone battalions (1st–9th, 11th) fought in the disastrous 1897 war with Ottoman Turkey. The 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 11th Battalions, comprising 6,996 men, fought in the Army of Thessaly, while the 1st, 3rd and 11th Battalions with 4,494 men were subordinated to the Army of Epirus.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, various reorganization attempts were undertaken, and the number of Evzone battalions varied considerably. In June 1900 two Evzone regiments were established by combining some of the hitherto independent battalions: the 1st Evzone Regiment (1ο Σύνταγμα Ευζώνων) comprised the 6th, 8th, and 9th Evzone Battalions, and the 2nd Evzone Regiment (2ο Σύνταγμα Ευζώνων) the 1st and 4th Evzone Battalions. The new army regulations composed in 1903–04 combined the 1st and 2nd Evzone Regiments in the 1st Brigade under the 1st Infantry Division, with an additional Evzone Battalion (1st–3rd) attached to each of the three infantry divisions. \n\nThis structure was not of long duration, however, as in 1904 a new, more homogeneous divisional structure was adopted, with four regular infantry regiments and two Evzone battalions for each of the three infantry divisions. 1st Division now comprised the 4th and 6th Evzone Battalions, 2nd Infantry Division the 1st and 2nd Evzone Battalions, and 3rd Infantry Division the 3rd and 7th Evzone Battalions. The 1910 army regulations envisaged again nine Evzone Battalions (to 18 infantry regiments), but the 1912 regulations reduced them again to six, each of four companies and two machine gun squads.\n\nIn the mobilization prior to the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912, four more Evzone battalions were raised. They operated independently on the vanguard or the flanks of the army. They distinguished themselves for their fighting spirit suffering high casualties, especially among officers. \n\nSubsequently the Evzone units were increased to five regiments, which fought with distinction as elite shock troops in the First World War, the Asia Minor Campaign and the Greco-Italian War.\n\nDuring the German invasion in 1941, a memorable event is said to have occurred: on April 27, as the German Army was entering Athens, the Germans ascended to the Acropolis of Athens and ordered the young Evzone who was guarding the flag post, Konstantinos Koukidis (q.v.), to haul the Greek flag down and replace it with the swastika flag. The young soldier did so, but refused to hand over the Greek flag to the Germans, and instead wrapped himself in it and fell off the Acropolis to his death.\n\nAfter the occupation of the country, in 1943, the collaborationist government raised a number of \"Security Battalions\" (Τάγματα Ασφαλείας), which were dressed in the Evzone uniform and participated in operations against the EAM-ELAS partisans. They were derisively known as \"Germanotsoliades\" (\"German Evzones\") or \"Tagmatasfalites\" (\"Security Battalionists\"), and were disbanded after liberation in 1944.\n\nAfter the war, the reconstituted Hellenic Army did not re-establish the Evzone regiments, their elite status and role being assumed by the newly established Mountain Raiding Companies. The traditions and distinctions of the Evzones are, however, maintained by a special ceremonial unit, which has served under several names: Palace Guard (), Flag Guard (), Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard (), Royal Guard () and after 1974, with the abolition of the monarchy, the Presidential Guard (). Several regular Army Infantry units have been given the numbers and names of the post-1913 Evzone Regiments, however, these names are only honorific.\n\nThe historical units were numbered and known as Τάγμα Ευζώνων (\"Evzone Battalion\") or Σύνταγμα Ευζώνων (\"Evzone Regiment\"). The first Evzone Regiment was formed in 1912, shortly before the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. The \"traditional\" and well-known Evzone regiments, which fought in World War I, the Asia Minor Campaign, and World War II, were formed after the Balkan Wars by the Royal Decree of 23 December 1913. Since the regiments were distinctive, elite units, they had dual numbers—the first, numbering them in the Evzones order of seniority, the second, in the overall infantry hierarchy. Thus the 5/42 Evzone Regiment was the 5th Evzone regiment, but also the 42nd infantry regiment.\n\n\nIn 1833, the uniform of the Evzones (as in all infantry companies of the line battalions) was in the unpopular Bavarian style of blue trousers, tailcoats and shako. As light infantry the Evzones were distinguished only by green braid and plumes. In 1837, a new uniform was created; based on the traditional fustanella style worn by the klephts, armatoli, and many of the best-known fighters of the Greek War of Independence. At first, it was only issued to the native light infantry battalions, but its popularity led to its adoption as the official uniform of the Evzones in 1868.\n\nIn the 1868 regulations, officers and warrant officers continued wearing the regular Army uniform, but the other ranks of the Evzone battalions were issued a special uniform with a white wool jacket (φέρμελη) with dark blue cord embroidery (γαϊτάνια), with the battalion number embroidered in crimson at the end of each sleeve. The jacket was also decorated with two rows of twelve yellow metal buttons on the chest, and eight on the sleeves. A fez (φέσιον) with a silk tassel, bearing the national cockade and the royal crown was worn; plus a knee-length fustanella of white cloth, closed by a belt of cotton in blue and white stripes. On the legs were worn tsarouchia, with white wool leggings and garters; the former decorated in dark blue embroidery. For bad weather, an \"iron-coloured\" knee-length cape was issued.\n\nDuring the remainder of the 19th century, the dress of the separate line battalions of Evzones appears to have differed slightly in detail between units. After a few minor changes over the years, it became the familiar uniform seen worn today by the Presidential Guard. In 1910 a new field service uniform was adopted, substituting a khaki \"farion\" cap and khaki \"doulama\" jacket for the respectively red and dark blue garments previously worn. The long white woollen hose and turned-up \"tsarouchia\" shoes were still retained, although sometimes replaced on campaign by the standard khaki trousers and leather boots of the line infantry. The khaki and off-white field uniform of 1910 was still being worn during the Greek-Italian War of 1940-41, although without the red collar piping and shoulder straps of the earlier uniform. The traditional black fez tassel, and large pompoms on the footwear, were usually removed before battle.\n\n\n"}

Ted Rall describes the comic as \"explor[ing] the limits of pessimism and fatal consequence in a universe that would be difficult to imagine on the printed page.\" The comic was officially \"on hiatus\" from September 2006 to December 10, 2012, with the comic \"I Name Thee Annihilator\" ending the hiatus but ultimately being the penultimate entry in the series.\n\nDale and David are the primary characters, although they do not appear in every episode, and there is a small cast of real-life supporting characters, including schoolfriend/mad scientist Paul, Dale's sister Sally, and David's mother, Debby Hellman (who dated the Devil in one strip).\n\nDale and David, who met at The Park School of Baltimore in ninth grade,\npublished the first strip on July 15, 2004, and since then have produced more than 40 strips. New episodes appeared with varying frequency, sometimes weekly, monthly, or occasionally after a two-month hiatus.\n\nCharacters, many introduced for just one strip, are often surreal and imaginative, as with a wise yeti or breakdancing giants. Fantastical characters, often exhibiting magical or anthropomorphic qualities, include intelligent robots, cute woodland animals, and dogs.\n\nThe plots are erratic. Most episodes seemingly begin in surreal realms and hardly leave; others take root in reality. Real-world Dale beats up all the monks in a Buddhist monastery, whereupon a group of Shaolin monks seek revenge; these events span two episodes. The first 35 episodes maintain almost no continuity between strips. The few recurring characters often change appearance (especially facial hair) from strip to strip.\n\nMarch 4, 2006 saw a change in direction for the comic; the first 35 strips, dating back to 2004, were retrospectively grouped as \"Series One,\" and all episodes since have been released as part of \"Series Two\". While the comics of the first series generally featured the non-continuous adventures of the authors, the second series consists of loosely connected storylines with each new strip generally having some connection to previous episodes – either by following characters through more than one strip, introducing characters with a connection to others already featured or by making tangential references (\"The Earthbound Clouds\" pictures both the mice of the previous strip, and Kitestring's girlfriend in the next strip, without either impacting on the storyline). Prior to the hiatus, David and Dale were not featured in a Series Two comic. This changed with \"I Name Thee Annihilator\" in which both characters were featured in a comic similar to the style of those in Series One. It remains to be seen whether or not the theme of interconnected storylines will continue in future comics in Series Two.\n\nThe strips are linked by recurrent themes and styles of visual play, although the specific art style varies considerably from strip to strip, and sometimes even from panel to panel. The styles range from the intricately detailed to cartoonishly simple, and apply subtle, medium-specific artistic devices, as in episodes 18 and 31. The strips usually have more than ten panels, although sometimes there is only one or no panels at all. The paneled structure frequently breaks down as panels overlap or bleed color, lines and characters into one another. Hellman draws the comic entirely on a computer, using Photoshop with a WACOM tablet.\n\n\"A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible\" was named one of the best webcomics of 2004 and 2005 by \"The Webcomics Examiner\", won the 2005 Web Cartoonist's Choice Award for Outstanding Layout, following the latter achievement up the following year by winning Outstanding Layout again, along with awards for Outstanding Use of Color and the overall award for Outstanding Artist.\n\nIn June 2006, Hellman And Beran were interviewed in the book \",\" edited by Ted Rall. \"Attitude 3\" also includes other webcomics such as \"Cat and Girl\", \"Fetus-X\", \"Diesel Sweeties\", and \"The Perry Bible Fellowship\".\n\n"}

In the latter campaign, he was slain by Byzantine forces. \n\nIkrima's father was Amr ibn Hisham ibn al-Mughira, a leader of the polytheistic Quraysh tribe's Banu Makhzum clan who was called \"Abu Jahl\" (father of ignorance) by the Muslims for his stringent opposition to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Ikrima's father was slain fighting the Muslims at the Battle of Badr in 624. At the Battle of Uhud, where the Quraysh defeated the Muslims, Ikrima commanded the tribe's left wing; his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded the right wing. The Makhzum's losses at Badr had diminished their influence and gave way to the Banu Abd Shams under Abu Sufyan to take the helm against Muhammad. However, the influence of Ikrima, by then the preeminent leader of the Makhzum, in Mecca had increased toward the end of the 620s. He opposed the negotiations with Muhammad at Hudaybiyya and broke the agreement when he and some Quraysh attacked the Banu Khuza'a. When Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630, Ikrima escaped as a fugitive for the Yemen where the Makhzum had commercial connections. \n\nMuhammad later pardoned Ikrima, apparently after being petitioned by Ikrima's wife and paternal first cousin Umm Hakim bint al-Harith, who had converted to Islam. According to the historian al-Waqidi, Muhammad appointed Ikrima as a tax collector of the Hawazin tribal confederation in 632. Ikrima was in the Tihama region between Yemen and Mecca when Muhammad died. According to Blankinship, after he embraced Islam, Ikrima devoted to his new religion's cause \"much of the energy that had characterized his earlier opposition\" to Islam. After Muhammad's death, the Islamic prophet's close associate Abu Bakr became caliph (leader of the Muslim community) and appointed Ikrima to lead a campaign against rebel Arab tribes in the Ridda wars (632–633), which saw him command expeditions around the entire Arabian Peninsula, with particular focus in Yemen. By 634, Abu Bakr reassigned Ikrima and his troops, who hailed from the Tihama, northern Yemen, Bahrayn and Oman, to reinforce Khalid's army in the Muslim conquest of Syria. Ikrima most likely killed fighting the Byzantines in the Battle of Ajnadayn in Palestine in 634, though it is also held that he may have been slain in the Battle of Yarmouk in 636.\n\nAccording to the historian al-Ya'qubi (d. 898), Ikrima was married to Qutayla bint Qays ibn Ma'dikarib, the sister of the chieftain of the Kindite Banu Mu'awiya clan, al-Ash'ath ibn Qays. She was sent from Yemen to marry Muhammad but arrived after the Islamic prophet died and afterward was wed to Ikrima. The Islamic tradition mostly agrees that Ikrima died childless, though the 8th-century historian Sayf ibn Umar mentions a son named Amr and Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), possibly deriving his information from Sayf, calls this same son Umar. The modern historian Michael Lecker holds that Ikrima's marriage to Qutayla proved problematic for later Muslim scholars as the remarriage of Muhammad's wives was forbidden. Lecker holds the Islamic tradition censored out the original report used by the traditional Muslim authors that Qutayla bore Ikrima \"a feeble-minded son\", which he considers to be the \"more trustworthy\" version. Ikrima was also married to Asma bint al-Nu'man ibn Abi al-Jawn, another Kindite wife of Muhammad whose marriage had never been consummated. He married her after a relatively short marriage to Ikrima's Makhzumite kinsman al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya. Ikrima's wife Umm Hakim married Caliph Umar () sometime after Ikrima's death.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152261", "title": "Petro Vlahos", "text": "Petro Vlahos\n\nPetro Vlahos (; August 20, 1916 – February 10, 2013), was an engineer and inventor, considered to be one of the pioneering scientific and technical innovators of the motion picture and television industries. Vlahos consistently devised solutions that made the modern blockbuster possible - he is remembered in particular for creating the Ultimatte process, which refined the colour process known as \"bluescreening\" or alternatively \"greenscreening\" to solve the transparency, edge-sharpening and \"blue spill\" problems of simple chroma keying, and combining this with motion control camera technology to create the modern special effects shot. This technology allows film editors in post-production to digitally remove an image of an actor working in front of a usually blue or green colored background and insert him into any computer-generated or other preexisting digital background. In recognition of his contributions he was awarded multiple Oscars, as well as an Emmy Award.\n\nVlahos was born in Raton, New Mexico, the son of Greek immigrants. He showed an early aptitude for electronics and ham radio and in 1941 he gained his Engineering degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He worked as a designer for Douglas Aircraft in World War II, and later as a radar engineer at Bell Laboratories. After the war, he moved to Hollywood and worked for MGM.\n\nThe technology used today as a way of combining actors with background footage still derives from the techniques he developed. Vlahos was not the first to use the blue-screen technology—it was invented by Larry Butler for the 1940 filming of \"The Thief of Bagdad\"—but he made the process much more realistic and scientific. He created a system called the sodium vapor matte first for the spectacular 1959 remake of the epic \"Ben Hur,\" and later the Disney musical \"Mary Poppins\" (1964) which would win him an academy award. He later refined the color-difference bluescreen process that made memorable visual effects possible in films and developed a way to minimize the unfortunate side effects of earlier methods. Vlahos' breakthrough was to create a complicated laboratory process which involved separating the blue, green and red parts of each frame before combining them back together in a certain order. He moved the process along and introduced the use of motion control cameras during bluescreen work. He called his cutting-edge invention the \"colour-difference travelling matte scheme\". \n\nAlong with his son, Paul Vlahos, he founded the Ultimatte Corporation in Chatsworth, California, in 1976. His company's first Ultimatte units were analog \"black boxes\" which later evolved into advanced, real-time digital hardware and computer software products.\n\nWhen sci-fi and fantasy films became dominant at the box office, Vlahos’ techniques became dominant in filmmaking, essential to movies such as the \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Refinements of his pioneering technique were used to make many of the blockbuster films of the 1990s, notably \"Titanic\" (1997), in which dangerous, expensive or difficult to film scenes were finally possible.\n\nIn all, Petro Vlahos held more than 35 patents for film-related gadgetry.\n\nA member of the Academy’s original Motion Picture Research Council, he was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences many times, starting with a Scientific and Technical Award in 1960 for a camera flicker indicating device.\n\nHe won his first Oscar in 1964 for the \"conception and perfection of techniques for color traveling matte composite cinematography.\"\n\nIn 1978, Petro won an Emmy Award for Ultimatte Compositing Technology.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him a Medal of Commendation in 1992. In 1993 he was the recipient of the Gordon E.

{"id": "2152262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152262", "title": "Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi", "text": "Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi\n\nThe Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi or Hoca Ahmed Yesevi Türbesi (, \"Qoja Ahmet Iassaýı kesenesi\") is a mausoleum in the city of Turkestan, in southern Kazakhstan. The structure was commissioned in 1389 by Timur, who ruled the area as part of the expansive Timurid Empire, to replace a smaller 12th-century mausoleum of the famous Turkic poet and Sufi mystic, Khoja Ahmed Yasawi (1093–1166). However, construction was halted with the death of Timur in 1405.\n\nDespite its incomplete state, the mausoleum has survived as one of the best-preserved of all Timurid constructions. Its creation marked the beginning of the Timurid architectural style. The experimental spatial arrangements, innovative architectural solutions for vault and dome constructions, and ornamentations using glazed tiles made the structure the prototype for this distinctive art, which spread across the empire and beyond.\n\nThe religious structure continues to draw pilgrims from across Central Asia and has come to epitomize the Kazakh national identity. It has been protected as a national monument, while UNESCO recognized it as the country's first site of patrimony, declaring it a World Heritage Site in 2003.\nThe Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yesevi is situated in the north-eastern part of the modern-day town of Turkestan (formerly known as Hazrat-e Turkestan), an ancient centre of caravan trade known earlier as Khazret and later as Yasi, in the southern part of Kazakhstan. The structure is within the vicinity of a historic citadel, which is now an archaeological site.\n\nRemains of medieval structures such as other mausoleums, mosques and bath houses characterize the archaeological area. To the north of the Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi, a reconstructed section of the citadel wall from the 1970s separates the historical area from the developments of the modern town.\n\nKhoja Ahmed Yasawi (Khawaja or Khwaja (Persian: خواجه pronounced khâje) corresponds to \"master\", whence Arabic: خواجة khawājah), also spelled as Khawajah Akhmet Yassawi or Hoca Ahmed Yesevi, was the 12th-century head of a regional school of Sufism, a mystic movement in Islam which began in the 9th century. He was born in Ispidjab (modern Sayram) in 1093, and spent most of his life in Yasi, dying there in 1166. He is widely revered in Central Asia and the Turkic-speaking world for popularizing Sufism, which sustained the diffusion of Islam in the area despite the contemporary onslaught of the Mongol invasion. The theological school he created turned Yasi into the most important medieval enlightening center of the area. He was also an outstanding poet, philosopher and statesman. Yasawi was interred in a small mausoleum, which became a pilgrimage site for Muslims.\n\nThe town of Yasi was largely spared during the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia in the 13th century. Overtime, the descendants of the Mongols settled in the area and converted to Islam. The town then came under the control of the Timurid Dynasty in the 1360s. Timur (Tamerlane), the founder of the dynasty, expanded the empire's realm to include Mesopotamia, Iran, and all of Transoxiana, with its capital located in Samarkand. To gain the support of local citizens, Timur adopted the policy of constructing monumental public and cult buildings. In Yasi, he put his attention to the construction of a larger mausoleum to house Yasawi's remains, with the intention of glorifying Islam, promoting its further dissemination, and improving the governance of the immediate areas.\n\nThe new mausoleum was begun in 1389. Timur imported builders from cities which he laid waste during his campaigns, including mosaic-workers from Shiraz and stonemasons and stucco-workers from Isfahan. The master builders were led by Khwaja Hosein Shirazi from Iran. It was reported that Timur himself participated in the design of the structure, where he introduced experimental spatial arrangements, types of vaults and domes. These innovations were later implemented in the religious edifices of other cities. However, the mausoleum was left unfinished, when Timur died in 1405.\n\nWhen the Timurid Empire disintegrated, control of the immediate territory passed on to the Kazakh Khanate, which made Yasi, then renamed Turkestan, its capital in the 16th century. The khans (Turkic for \"ruler\") sought to strengthen the political and religious importance of Turkestan to unify the nomadic tribes within the young state. Hence, as the khanate's political center, ceremonies for the elevation of the khans to the throne and missions from neighboring states were received in Turkestan. The Kazakh nobility also held their most important meetings to decide state-related matters in the capital.\n\nThe town, situated on the border of the nomadic and settled cultures, flourished as the khanate's largest trade and craft center. Fortifications were erected to safeguard this commercial role, including the 19th-century construction of defensive walls around the unfinished mausoleum, which became an important landmark and pilgrimage center of the town. In the succeeding centuries, Turkestan and its historic monuments became connected with the idea of the Kazakh state system. Political struggles and the shift in overland trade in favor of maritime routes soon led to the town's decline, before it finally passed on to the Russian Empire in 1864.\n\nThe town was eventually deserted; a new town center was developed west of the area, built around a new railway station. The territory came under Soviet rule by the 20th century. The new administration carried out preservation and restoration work on site, although they considered it more as an architectural rather than a spiritual structure. Hence, the mausoleum was closed to the devotees who came to pay homage to Yasawi. Nevertheless, the local khoja based at the mausoleum allowed pilgrims to secretly enter the structure at night. Beginning in 1922, several commissions took part in the technical investigation of the building. Regular maintenance has been in place beginning in 1938, while a series of restoration campaigns were started in 1945, with the last one being held from 1993 to 2000. Among the latest conservation steps implemented were the replacement of the structure's clay foundation with reinforced concrete, the consolidation of walls, the waterproofing of the roofs, and the layering of new tiles, based on historic designs and patterns, on the domes. The continuous conservation works have been in place when Kazakhstan gained its independence. The building is protected as a national monument and is included on the List of National Properties of Kazakhstan. The site is under the administration of the Azret-Sultan State Historical and Cultural Reserve Museum, in charge with the safeguarding, research, conservation, monitoring and maintenance of the mausoleum.\n\nThe unfinished state of the Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi, especially at the entrance portal and sections of the interior, allow for the better architectural scrutiny of how the monument was designed and constructed. The structure is rectangular in plan, measuring 45.8 × 62.7 m (150.3 × 205.7 ft), and is 38.7 m (127.0 ft) high. It is oriented from the south-east to the north-west.\n\nThe primary material used for the building is \"ganch\"—fired brick mixed with mortar, gypsum and clay—which was made in a plant located in Sauran. Layers of clay reaching a depth of 1.5 m (4.9 ft), to prevent the water penetration, were used for the original foundation. These were replaced with reinforced concrete in modern restoration works. The main entrance to the mausoleum is from the south-east, through which visitors are ushered into the 18.2 × 18.2-m (59.7 × 59.7-ft) Main Hall, known as \"Kazandyk\" (the \"copper room\"). The section is covered by the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia, also measuring 18.2 m (59.7 ft) in diameter. At the center of the \"Kazandyk\" is a bronze cauldron, used for religious purposes. The tomb of Yasawi is situated on the central axis at the end of the building in the northwest, with the sarcophagus located exactly at the center of the section, which has a double dome ribbed roof —the inner dome being 17.0 m (55.8 ft) high and the outer dome being 28.0 m (91.9 ft) high. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns. The interior is adorned with alabaster stalactites, known as \"muqarnas\". Additional rooms in the structure, totaling more than 35, include meeting rooms, a refectory, a library, and a mosque, which had light blue geometric and floral ornaments on its walls. The mausoleum's exterior walls are covered in glazed tiles constituting geometric patterns with Kufic and Suls epigraphic ornaments derived from the Qur'an. Initial plans also called for the addition of two minarets, but this was not realized when construction was halted in 1405.\n\nThe construction of the mausoleum provided important advances in building technology, displaying unsurpassed records of all kinds in terms of its vaulted constructions and artistic innovations. The achievements derived from the mausoleum's erection, together with the Timurids’ patronage of music, calligraphy, Persian miniature painting, literature, and various scientific pursuits, gave birth to a distinct Islamic artistic style, to be known as Timurid.\n\nThe spacious structure employed a radially symmetrical plan for spatial arrangement. The visual balance created by the precise construction became a characteristic aesthetic feature of Timurid buildings—one which would famously be adopted by the Mughal Architecture of India, especially in the gardens and structures of Humayun's Tomb and Taj Mahal, both commissioned by descendants of Timur.\n\nThe double dome technique executed in the mausoleum made possible the huge domes of the Timurid era. The dome is created by employing a squinch, or corner bracketing, that allows for the transition from a square, octagonal or 16-sided base to a dome top. Indeed, the mausoleum's main dome remains the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia.\n\nThe use of glazed tiles, mosaics, patterned brickwork, and Islamic calligraphy was also influential. Advances in pottery techniques allowed for the mass production of glazed tiles used for various decorative functions. Among the techniques devised for tile decoration are:\nThe employment of tiles and \"muqarnas\" bear strong influence from Iran, where many of Timur's architects were from. The covered surfaces create visual effects based on how the observer would view the building, and \"read\" the calligraphic messages. \n\nThe tile work was also used to obscure the structural joints of the building. The use of turquoise and azure-blue as the prominent color of choice for many structures were meant to contrast with the bright sunlight of the Central Asian desert.\n\nThe mausoleum's construction at a time when many other Central Asian settlements had been experiencing building sprees under Timur's political ideology allowed for the exchange of ideas and techniques across the empire. Master builders and laborers from the conquered cities congregated to build projects. The employment of Persian architects in leading the major construction activities resulted in the introduction of Persian elements in the Timurid style. This and the Timurids’ general patronage of the arts have made them the greatest patrons of Iranian culture.\n\nThe landmark architectural and artistic solutions realized in the erection of the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi were immediately utilized in other building endeavors, such as contemporary works in Samarkand, Herat, Meshed, Khargird, Tayabad, Baku and Tabriz. It is thought that the peak of Timurid Architecture could be found in the buildings of Samarkand. Timur filled his capital with both secular and religious monuments, as well as a plethora of gardens, which featured stone walls and floors with elaborate patterns and palaces outfitted with gold, silk and carpets. Among these are:\n\nThe mausoleum is thus seen as a prototype, marking the beginning of a new architectural style, which culminated in the monuments of Samarkand, but was also continuously developed as in the case of India's Mughal Architecture. Indeed, the Timurids’ outstanding achievement in architecture is encapsulated in an Arab proverb from one of Timur's buildings, \"If you want to know about us, observe our buildings.\" It is also for this reason that UNESCO has recognized the mausoleum as a World Heritage Site in 2003, following the same international recognition for the sites of Samarkand, Humayun's Tomb and Taj Mahal.\n\nThe larger mausoleum which Timurid ordered further enhanced the shrine's religious importance. During the Kazakh Khanate, prominent personalities chose to be buried within the immediate vicinity of the monument. Among these are Abulkhair, Rabi'i Sultan-Begim, Zholbarys-khan, Esim-khan, Ondan-sultan (the son of Shygai-khan), Ablai Khan, Kaz dauysty Kazbek-bi. The mausoleum's holy reputation also reached foreign lands. In the early 16th century, Ubaydullah Khan, the successor to Muhammad Shaybani Kahn of the neighboring Uzbek Khanate, stopped at the mausoleum before his battle against Babur, who would later become the founder of the Mughal Empire. He swore that if he were to emerge victorious, his rule would fully follow the sharia law.\nDespite the public closure of the monument during the Soviet era, the mausoleum has continued to draw pilgrims once the order was lifted. Up to contemporary times, the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi has remained an object of pilgrimage for Kazakh Muslims. Hence, the town of Turkestan became the second Mecca for the Muslims of Central Asia Indeed, the mausoleum's importance to the town is attested by Turkestan's former name, Hazrat-e Turkestan, which literally means \"Saint of Turkestan,\" a direct reference to Yesevi. \n\nAs the capital of the preceding Kazakh Khanate, which saw the emergence of the distinct Kazakh nationality, Turkestan remains the cultural heart of modern Kazakhstan. Being the burial site for the Sufi theologian and the khanate's Kazakh nobility, the mausoleum has further enhanced the town's prestige. The continuance of the Kazakh nation and Central Asian Islamic faith in modern times are testaments to the historical and cultural importance of Turkestan, with the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yesevi at its center. Perceived as one of the greatest mausoleums of the Islamic world, it has survived and remains a significant monument both to faith and architectural achievement in the region.\n\n\n"}

He was also the last Dean of Durham to govern the university.\n\nKitchin was the son of the Reverend Isaac Kitchin, Rector of St. Stephen's, Naughton, Suffolk. He was educated at King's College School and King's College, London, then at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1850 he took a Double First in Classics and Mathematics, promoted by seniority to MA (Oxon) in 1852. \n\nIn 1854, Kitchin was an examiner in Mathematics at Christ Church. He soon left Oxford to become Headmaster of Twyford Preparatory School in Hampshire, but returned to residence at Oxford as Censor in 1861. While at Christ Church, in late 1861 he was partly responsible for the ending of the Latin Prayer Service, conducted there since time immemorial, and for the continuation of which special provision had been made in the Act of Uniformity 1662. Kitchin served as Oxford's first Junior Censor of non-collegiate students from 1868 to 1883. He was also Select Preacher at Oxford for 1863–1864 and Whitehall Preacher for 1866–1867. He took a break from Oxford life to live at Brantwood, in the Lake District, from 1869 to 1871, a property later bought by his friend John Ruskin. While there he undertook assignments for the Clarendon Press, including working on the proofs of Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson's Icelandic-English Dictionary.\n\nHe was appointed as Chaplain to William Jacobson, Bishop of Chester, from 1871 to 1872, was tutor of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark (later Frederick VIII of Denmark), and was lecturer and tutor in History at Christ Church from 1870 to 1883. He was also Commissary to Charles Sandford, Bishop of Gibraltar, from 1874 to 1904, and was an Honorary Fellow of King's College, London, and an honorary Student (meaning Fellow) of Christ Church. In theology he was a moderate liberal.\nIn 1879, Kitchin was a member of a committee formed to create a women's college at Oxford \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\" This resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall, later renamed Somerville College.\n\nIn 1883, Kitchin was appointed as Dean of Winchester and in 1894 as Dean of Durham. At Oxford, his friends included John Ruskin and Lewis Carroll. \n\nWhile Dean of Winchester Kitchin was responsible for refurbishments within the Cathedral, most notably the restoration of the mediaeval reredos behind the High Altar, usually known as 'The Great Screen'. The restoration was initially entrusted to the architect J D Sedding. However, Sedding's design for the scheme did not meet with general satisfaction and was not implemented. Thereafter, Kitchin personally took over and master-minded the entire project, essentially as his own architect, commissioning the many new statues needed to populate the restored screen. When completed, this was acclaimed as one of the Church of England's major artistic ecclesiastical restorations of the 19th century.\n\nKitchin wrote the hymn 'Lift High the Cross' in 1887 for a Missionary Service in Winchester Cathedral. \n\nKitchin described several biblical manuscripts: Uncial 0132, minuscule 73, Minuscule 506, Minuscule 507, and Minuscule 639.\n\nIn 1910, when the University of Durham was given a new constitution, Kitchin was elected as its first Chancellor and remained in office until his death two years later.\n\nHe died on 13 October 1912. He is buried on the west (right hand side) of the entrance path to Durham Cathedral next to Bishop Alfred Tucker.\n\nOn 8 September 1863, at Westminster Abbey, Kitchin married Alice Maud Taylor, second daughter of Bridges Taylor, the British consul in Denmark. Their daughter Alexandra, known as 'Xie', born in 1864, became Lewis Carroll's favourite photographic subject. Their son George Herbert Kitchin (1870–1951), was a prolific architect, especially in Hampshire. Examples of his work include Compton End, Winchester, Lyegrove House, Sodbury, and Horsley Hall, Gresford. He was also a botanist and garden architect. They had three further children, two sons, Hugh Bridges and Brook Taylor, and a second daughter, Dorothy Maud Mary.\n\n"}

Barringer was hired to succeed George B. Sears as Superintendent of Schools. Dr. Barringer oversaw the construction of a second high school building at a cost of $300,000, which is the site of the current faculty parking lot. Construction started in 1878 and was completed in 1899. In 1907, the name of Newark High School was officially changed to Barringer, in honor of Dr. Barringer.\n\nThe Barringer High School Blue Bears compete in the Super Essex Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. With 1,115 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019-20 school year in Group IV for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 1,060 to 5,049 students in that grade range. Until the NJSIAA's 2009 realignment, the school had participated in Division B of the Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League, which was made up of high schools located in Bergen County, Essex County and Passaic County, and was separated into three divisions based on NJSIAA size classification. For football, the school was classified by the NJSIAA as North Jersey Group IV for 2018-20.\n\nIn 1918, during future major league baseball player Moe Berg’s senior season, the \"Newark Star-Eagle\" selected a nine-man \"dream team\" from the city's best prep and public high school baseball players, and Berg was named the team's third baseman.\n\nThe boys track team won the indoor track public school state championship in 1930, 1934 and 1939.\n\nThe boys' basketball team won the 1980 Group IV state championship, defeating Trenton Central High School in the tournament final.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This framework provides structure and stability, especially when a plastic material such as wax, newspaper or clay is being used as the medium. When sculpting the human figure, the armature is analogous to the major skeleton and has essentially the same purpose: to hold the body erect.\n\nAn armature is often made of heavy, dark aluminium wire which is stiff, but can be bent and twisted into shape without much difficulty. The wire is affixed to a base which is usually made of wood. The artist then begins fleshing out the sculpture by adding wax or clay over the wire. Depending on the material and technique, the armature may be left buried within the sculpture but, if the sculpture is to be hollowed out for firing, it must be removed. \n\nLarge representational sculptures meant for outdoor display are typically fashioned of bronze or other types of sheet metal, and they require armatures for internal support and stability. For example, a large armature designed by Gustave Eiffel holds up the Statue of Liberty. The armature can be seen from below by visitors to the base of the sculpture's interior. \n\nAn armature used in stop-motion animation is an articulated metal, wire or even wooden figure covered with material to build the character, but can be made to hold poses for extended periods of time.\n\nIn 3D computer animation, the analogous concept is the \"skeleton\" or \"rig\" used in skeletal animation.\n\n\n For this reason, much clay work for firing begins with a simple paper and/or wood armature. These materials can be removed relatively easily from finished piece while it is still fairly , without damaging it. Any paper left behind will burn out in the kiln.

The term is defined in IEEE P1363.2, in reference to one of the benefits of using a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol that is secure against off-line dictionary attacks. A ZKPP prevents any party from verifying guesses for the password without interacting with a party that knows it and, in the optimal case, provides exactly one guess in each interaction.\n\nTechnically speaking, a ZKPP is different from a zero-knowledge proof. This is because a ZKPP is defined more narrowly than the more general zero-knowledge proof. ZKPP is defined in IEEE 1363.2 as \"An interactive zero knowledge proof of knowledge of password-derived data shared between a prover and the corresponding verifier.\" Notice, that the definition is concerned further with password-derived data.\n\nA common use of a zero-knowledge password proof is in authentication systems where one party wants to prove its identity to a second party using a password but doesn't want the second party or anybody else to learn anything about the password.\n\nThe first methods to demonstrate a ZKPP were the encrypted key exchange methods (EKE) described by Steven M.

{"id": "2152318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152318", "title": "Armature (electrical)", "text": "Armature (electrical)\n\nIn electrical engineering, an armature is the component of an electric machine which carries alternating current. The armature windings conduct AC even on DC machines, due to the commutator action (which periodically reverses current direction) or due to electronic commutation, as in brushless DC motors. The armature can be on either the rotor (rotating part) or the stator (stationary part), depending on the type of electric machine.\n\nThe armature windings interact with the magnetic field (magnetic flux) in the air-gap; the magnetic field is generated either by permanent magnets, or electromagnets formed by a conducting coil.\n\nThe armature must carry current, so it is always a conductor or a conductive coil, oriented normal to both the field and to the direction of motion, torque (rotating machine), or force (linear machine). The armature's role is twofold. The first is to carry current across the field, thus creating shaft torque in a rotating machine or force in a linear machine. The second role is to generate an electromotive force (EMF).\n\nIn the armature, an electromotive force is created by the relative motion of the armature and the field. When the machine or motor is used as a motor, this EMF opposes the armature current, and the armature converts electrical power to mechanical power in the form of torque, and transfers it via the shaft. When the machine is used as a generator, the armature EMF drives the armature current, and the shaft's movement is converted to electrical power. In an induction generator, generated power is drawn from the stator.\n\nA growler is used to check the armature for shorts, opens and grounds.\n\nThe word \"armature\" was first used in its electrical sense, i.e. \"keeper of a magnet\", in mid 19th century.\n\nThe parts of an alternator or related equipment can be expressed in either mechanical terms or electrical terms. Although distinctly separate these two sets of terminology are frequently used interchangeably or in combinations that include one mechanical term and one electrical term. This may cause confusion when working with compound machines like brushless alternators, or in conversation among people who are accustomed to work with differently configured machinery.\n\nIn most generators, the field magnet is rotating, and is part of the rotor, while the armature is stationary, and is part of the stator. Both motors and generators can be built either with a stationary armature and a rotating field or a rotating armature and a stationary field. The pole piece of a permanent magnet or electromagnet and the moving, iron part of a solenoid, especially if the latter acts as a switch or relay, may also be referred to as armatures.\n\nIn a DC machine, two sources of magnetic fluxes are present; 'armature flux' and 'main field flux'. The effect of armature flux on the main field flux is called \"armature reaction\". The armature reaction changes the distribution of the magnetic field, which affects the operation of the machine. The effects of the armature flux can be offset by adding a compensating winding to the main poles, or in some machines adding intermediate magnetic poles, connected in the armature circuit.\n\nArmature reaction is essential in amplidyne rotating amplifiers.\n\nArmature reaction drop is the effect of a magnetic field on the distribution of the flux under main poles of a generator.\n\nSince an armature is wound with coils of wire, a magnetic field is set up in the armature whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the generator field and is called cross magnetization of the armature. The effect of the armature field is to distort the generator field and shift the neutral plane. The neutral plane is the position where the armature windings are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA). This effect is known as armature reaction and is proportional to the current flowing in the armature coils.\n\nThe geometrical neutral axis (GNA) is the axis that bisects the angle between the centre line of adjacent poles. The magnetic neutral axis (MNA) is the axis drawn perpendicular to the mean direction of the flux passing through the centre of the armature. No e.m.f. is produced in the armature conductors along this axis because then they cut no flux. When no current is there in the armature conductors, the MNA coincides with GNA.\n\nThe brushes of a generator must be set in the neutral plane; that is, they must contact segments of the commutator that are connected to armature coils having no induced emf. If the brushes were contacting commutator segments outside the neutral plane, they would short-circuit \"live\" coils and cause arcing and loss of power.\n\nWithout armature reaction, the magnetic neutral axis (MNA) would coincide with geometrical neutral axis (GNA). Armature reaction causes the neutral plane to shift in the direction of rotation, and if the brushes are in the neutral plane at no load, that is, when no armature current is flowing, they will not be in the neutral plane when armature current is flowing. For this reason it is desirable to incorporate a corrective system into the generator design.\n\nThese are two principal methods by which the effect of armature reaction is overcome. The first method is to shift the position of the brushes so that they are in the neutral plane when the generator is producing its normal load current. in the other method, special field poles, called interpoles, are installed in the generator to counteract the effect of armature reaction.\n\nThe brush-setting method is satisfactory in installations in which the generator operates under a fairly constant load. If the load varies to a marked degree, the neutral plane will shift proportionately, and the brushes will not be the correct position at all times. The brush-setting method is the most common means of correcting for armature reaction in small generators (those producing approximately 1000 W or less). Larger generators require the use of interpoles.\n\nCoils of the winding are distributed over the entire surface of the air gap, which may be the rotor or the stator of the machine. In a \"lap\" winding, there are as many current paths between the brush (or line) connections as there are poles in the field winding. In a \"wave\" winding, there are only two paths, and there are as many coils in series as half the number of poles. So, for a given rating of machine, a wave winding is more suitable for large currents and low voltages.\n\nWindings are held in slots in the rotor or armature covered by stator magnets. The exact distribution of the windings and selection of the number of slots per pole of the field greatly influences the design of the machine and its performance, affecting such factors as commutation in a DC machine or the waveform of an AC machine. \nArmature wiring is made from copper or aluminum. Copper armature wiring enhances electrical efficiencies due to its higher electrical conductivity. Aluminum armature wiring is lighter and less expensive than copper.\n\n\n"}

Their single-lens reflex (SLR) system-cameras competed with Pentax, Hasselblad, Mamiya and others in the medium-format camera market.\n\nBefore introduction of the first of what would become a dynasty of Zenza Bronica cameras in 1959, the Latinized Zenza Bronica name was already a popular Japanese luxury goods brand of the Shinkodo Works (in Japanese: ) since 1947, specialized in the production of intricate crafted and decorated personal accessories, such as metal cigarette lighters and cases, cosmetic compacts, and watches, of diverse styles and designs.\n\nThe company's founder Zenzaburō Yoshino (in Japanese: , b. 25 January 1911 — d. 23 November 1988), wherefrom the Latinized Zenza Bronica brand name is derived, was the third son born into a Japanese rice merchant family. At an early age Yoshino showed deep reverence for the technical innovation and mechanics of world-renowned cameras produced by the likes of Leica, Contax and Rollei. Both fascinated and yet increasingly frustrated by the limitations of the cameras produced at that time period, where each camera's merits and demerits were not solved by just one camera, Yoshino visioned creating a high-precision interchangeable single-lens reflex camera modular system of his own design.\n\nYoshino's ambition, however, would require substantial investment, which he gradually self-funded from his family business in transportation and his passion for cameras by the establishment of a small camera store in Tokyo's Kanda district. Yoshino's camera store and his immense familiarity with deluxe foreign cameras became a huge success with photography enthusiasts in Japan, buying and selling luxury Leica and Contax cameras, which also gained popularity with US Army soldiers stationed in Japan after World War II. This formed the funding basis for his founding in 1947 of the Shinkodo Works with a vision of camera production, which at first produced Bronica brand luxury art deco accessories such as cigarette lighters and cases including watches, and positioned Bronica as a luxury brand in Japanese department stores, with popularity thriving among US Army soldiers in Japan.\n\nThe Shinkodo Works was Yoshino's precursor production base and funding source for what would later serve his Bronica camera and photographic equipment manufacturing; later consolidated under the \"Zenza Bronica Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha\" (Zenza Bronica Industries, Inc) company. On 17 January 1952, the Shinkodo Works was directed by Yoshino to begin research and development of the Bronica prototype camera.\n\nThe prototype was a modular camera named the \"Yoshino Flex\". In June 1956 the Shinkodo Works created its first handmade example camera, and on reaching perfection in October 1958 with Yoshino's eighth prototype camera, the development costs had reached a sum of 200 million Yen, a huge sum at that time. The final prototype bore the Latinized nameplate \"ZENZA BRONICA\"—the Bronica Z (\"Zen-za\") rollfilm camera—and first appeared at the Philadelphia Camera Show in March 1959, where it received ecstatic industry press coverage and left a deep lasting impression of being the world's dream camera. The Bronica Z modular camera system, shortly later with slight modifications renamed the Zenza Bronica D (Deluxe) and successor Bronicas, using large-coverage film format, high-quality Nikkor lenses supplied by the then Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd., (Nikon Corporation) became instant successes in the deluxe camera market worldwide. The Bronica D was the Japanese answer and first serious challenger to the Swedish Hasselblad cameras, and in several technical ways outclassed the Swedish offerings. Such was the design success of Bronica, that in the United States it attracted influential figures from the photographic industry such as Burt Keppler who met with Yoshino. Bronica later introduced optics and lens units of its own manufacture incorporating Seiko shutters with its later camera designs and held a portfolio of international patents.\n\nBronica was eventually acquired by the lens manufacturer Tamron Co., Ltd., in 1998 with emphasis on Bronica's optical lens manufacturing. In May 2000, Tamron introduced under the Bronica brand the RF645 rangefinder camera. Tamron discontinued the brand's single-lens reflex camera models (ETRSi, SQ-Ai, SQ-B and GS-1) between June 2002 and December 2004, sales having suffered from the lack of consideration to a digital camera back and loss of market share to digital photography and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, particularly for the wedding and portrait photography business which had previously been a heavy user of medium-format photographic film but switched quickly to digital photography for its commercial workflow benefits. Bronica's last model, the RF645 rangefinder camera, was discontinued in September 2005, and marked the termination of the Bronica camera brand business.\n\nBronicas were workhorse photographic film cameras used by professional photographers for many years until the process of digital photography became widely adopted. Bronica cameras are, however, still widely used by photographers—both professional and advanced amateurs—whilst the commercial production of photographic 120 film remains available, in no small part due to superior image quality of 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7cm photographic film formats over smaller film (35mm) and digital image sensor formats.\n\nThe Japan Camera and Optical Instruments Inspection and Testing Institute (JCII) at its camera museum located in Ichibanchō district, central Tokyo, has a selection of Bronica camera models preserved among its museum display collections; as part of the museum's designation \"preserving cameras considered of historical significance\".\n\nBronica SLR system-cameras employed a modular design: The major components of the camera—lens, body, film-back and viewfinder were separate and interchangeable, providing options to match the specific photography or workflow needs of the photographer.\n\nFrom its start, Bronica introduced a number of 6x6 cm medium-format SLR cameras with focal plane shutter, which used Nikkor lenses from Nikon, until this line was discontinued with the introduction of the successor Bronica SQ-series. These models included:\n\nNotably, the Bronica EC was the first medium-format SLR camera with an electrically operated focal plane shutter (Japan Patent No.: 43/94431 24 December 1968; US Patent No. US3696727), while the EC-TL was the first medium-format camera with Aperture priority automatic exposure (AE).\n\nThe range of Nikkor lenses for these remarkable cameras reached from 30mm (fisheye) to 1200mm and comprised about 30 lenses. Lens optics supplied by Carl Zeiss in Jena, Tokyo Optical Co., Ltd., Norita optics, Komura-Komuranon (Sankyo Kohki), Schneider Kreuznach, as well as lens optics later manufactured by Bronica itself based on designs by Zeiss and Japanese lens manufacturers were available, as well as a wide range of accessories, including different film magazines, bellows, and viewfinders.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152338", "title": "KUBE (FM)", "text": "KUBE (FM)\n\nKUBE (93.3 MHz, \"KUBE 93.3\") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Seattle, Washington. The station airs a rhythmic contemporary radio format and is owned and operated by iHeartMedia. The studios and offices are on Elliott Avenue West in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood northwest of downtown. The transmitter is located on Cougar Mountain.\n\nThe station signed on the air on May 6, 1964, as KBLE-FM. It was owned by Eastside Broadcasting, as the sister station to KNBX-AM 1050. While KNBX aired country music, KBLE-FM aired a Christian radio format. It was powered at 6,600 watts, a fraction of its current output.\n\nWithin a few years, the formats were flipped. KBLE-FM began playing country music while the AM station changed its call letters to KBLE and served as a Christian radio station. KBLE-FM's power was increased to 20,000 watts and its transmitter was moved to Cougar Mountain in Issaquah.\n\nIn the 1970s, the stations were acquired by Ostrander-Wilson, which returned the religious format to KBLE-FM. It also increased its power to 100,000 watts, making it audible from Olympia to Mount Vernon and around Puget Sound.\n\nOn March 17, 1981, after First Media bought the station, KBLE-FM flipped to an automated Top 40/CHR format as \"The Northwest's New 93 FM.\" The station's first song was \"Use ta Be My Girl\" by The O'Jays, followed by \"Beast of Burden\" by The Rolling Stones.\n\nOn July 8, 1981, at 5:04 p.m., the station officially launched with a live and local staff of DJs. On April 2, 1982, the call letters were changed to KUBE and the station became known as \"KUBE 93 FM.\" Shortly after the switch to Top 40, the station shot up to the top 5 in the Seattle market ratings (occasionally reaching #1 in some books and target demographics). In 1989, Cook Inlet Broadcasters acquired the station.\n\nKUBE competed against Top 40 powerhouse KPLZ (owned by Golden West Broadcasting), creating an intense rivalry between the two stations through the rest of the 1980s. From KUBE's Top 40 launch until September 1995, mornings were hosted by Charlie Brown (formerly of KJR) and Ty Flint (formerly of KVI).\n\nIn November 1991, KUBE shifted to a Rhythmic contemporary direction as \"KUBE 93 Jams\", and maintained strong ratings during this period.\nIn March 1994, Cook Inlet sold KUBE to a partnership between New Century Management and the Ackerley Group called New Century Media. (KJR and soft adult contemporary station KLTX joined the group in July.) Also that month, likely due to the public outcry of a \"gangland-style\" drive by shooting of a Ballard High School student (which some blamed hip hop music and a growing gangster culture in Seattle as a motivator behind it), as well as their audience's changing music tastes, KUBE shifted to a hybrid Rhythmic/Modern Rock format as simply \"KUBE 93.\" The station began using the slogans \"Seattle's New Music Revolution\" and \"Channel X,\" a popular way to identify modern rock stations at the time. However, the station's ratings were not impressive with the format, and by November of that year, the station flipped back to a full-blown Rhythmic format. The station quickly regained its top 10 status, usually peaking at #1 in several books for the next several years.\n\nIn February 1998, the Ackerley Group bought the station outright from New Century.\n\nFor many years, KUBE marketed itself as \"Seattle's #1 Hit Music Station, KUBE 93.\" iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) purchased KUBE, along with sister stations KJR, KJR-FM, KFNK and outdoor advertiser AK Media, from Ackerley Communications in 2001. On April 1, 2009, Clear Channel acquired Top 40 rival KBKS from CBS Radio. At the time, KUBE was competing against Rhythmic AC station KQMV (Movin' 92.5), owned by Sandusky. KUBE changed its slogan to \"More Non-Stop Music,\" and then to \"Hits & Hip-Hop\".\n\nKUBE was the home of \"The T-Man Show\" morning show, which aired from September 1995 to September 2009, when \"The T-Man\" retired to become a professional poker player. The show featured Robert \"The T-Man\" Tepper, who was known for never showing his face to audiences, as well as co-hosts Pasty Dave (who was the show's producer), Hot Shot Scott, Stephen Kilbreath, Vinnie The Pooh and Tari. The show was also briefly syndicated through Premiere Radio Networks, and was heard on KKRZ in Portland, KYLD in San Francisco and several other cities.\n\nShellie Hart, longtime midday DJ and music director for the station, was let go in November 2011 due to budget cuts issued by Clear Channel. Hart had been with the station since 1991, except for a brief 3-year period between 1996 and 1999, when Hart programmed modern rock station KEDJ Phoenix. Hart is currently at KRWM.\n\nDespite many years of high ratings, around 2011, however, KUBE's ratings began declining, largely due to poor programming and marketing decisions. KUBE was also no exception to company-wide budget cuts at Clear Channel, with several long-time personalities replaced with voicetracked talent from outside of the market. New competition from KQMV and KHTP took away some of KUBE's listeners.\n\nKUBE also rotated through a few morning shows after \"The T-Man Show\" ended, such as Eddie Francis & Karen Wild, The JV Show (syndicated from sister KYLD), The Breakfast Club, and DJ SupaSam. None of these programming changes resulted in any ratings improvement for the station. In the December 2015 Nielsen ratings period for the Seattle market, KUBE was ranked #13 with a 2.3 share.\n\nAs part of a major format shuffle involving four of iHeart's Seattle radio stations, on January 19, 2016, at Noon, after playing \"Whatever You Like\" by T.I., KUBE's long-time Rhythmic CHR format and branding moved to lower-power sister station KKBW (104.9 FM), displacing that station's Active Rock format. At the same time, 93.3 adopted KBKS's Mainstream CHR format, added in some newer rhythmic titles to the playlist, and rebranded as \"Power 93.3.\" The first song on \"Power\" was \"Sorry\" by Justin Bieber. This returned the 93.3 frequency in Seattle to a Top 40/Mainstream format for the first time in nearly 24 years. The station also brought in a new live and local air staff which included Carla Marie & Anthony for mornings, Kat Fisher for middays, Kwame Dankwa on afternoon drive and Brady for evenings.\n\nThe station took on the KPWK call letters on January 26, 2016; the KUBE call letters moved to KKBW the same day. Ratings did not improve much, with the station usually ranked in the mid-2 to mid-3 share of the market. Meanwhile, KQMV saw a big ratings boost at the time, sometimes finishing in first place. In the April 2018 ratings, KPWK was ranked #18 with a 2.8 share, well behind KQMV, which had a 6.8 share.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, at 3 p.m., after playing \"Wait\" by Maroon 5, KPWK flipped back to Rhythmic CHR, returning to the \"KUBE\" branding, as \"KUBE 93.3.\" The first song on the revived KUBE was \"Nice for What\" by Drake. Concurrently with the move, KBKS also returned to its previous Mainstream Top 40 format. The KUBE call letters returned on May 11, 2018. Positioned as \"Seattle's #1 for Hip Hop,\" the playlist is focused on current hip hop hits as well as some gold/re-current hip hop titles from the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nKUBE broadcasts in the HD Radio format.\n\nWhen KUBE signed on HD operations in 2006, KUBE's HD2 sub-channel carried a hip hop format branded as \"KUBE 2.\" In 2009, it was replaced with a broad-based Rhythmic format known as \"WiLD\". The \"WiLD\" format was patterned after most Clear Channel owned Rhythmic Top 40 stations by playing Mainstream Rhythmic Pop/Dance tracks and very few Hip Hop/R&B tracks. This would later be replaced with a children's radio format branded as \"Kids Club Radio.\" From December 11, 2017 through May 3, 2018, KPWK-HD2 carried the rhythmic CHR format as \"KUBE 93 HD2,\" after the 104.9 frequency was divested. After KUBE was revived on the analog/HD1, KUBE-HD2 flipped to a classic hip hop format. On June 26, 2019, KUBE-HD2 changed to iHeart's \"Pride Radio\" network, which airs Top 40/Dance music targeting the LGBTQ community. This marks the second such format in Seattle, the other being Entercom's \"Channel Q\" format airing on KNDD-HD2/K277AE.\n\n"}

Such variations are often quieter than other lines because the early release of tension minimizes the possibility of surprise tactics or sharp, forcing lines, particularly where it results in a symmetrical pawn structure. \nWhite may choose an exchange variation as a relatively risk-free way to try to exploit White's first-move advantage. Players such as Mikhail Botvinnik and Yasser Seirawan used the Exchange Variation of the Slav Defense this way.\n\nWhite may also play an exchange variation in an effort to draw the game. This approach is not without risks. International Master John L. Watson has written that in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, \"Black can always make the struggle an unbalanced one if he chooses\". Moreover, playing so blatantly for a draw may place a psychological burden on White: \"White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and he knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative.\"\n\nNot all exchange variations are quiet; the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld Defense is regarded as one of White's sharpest and most aggressive options, since it allows White to build up a massive pawn center, which Black will try to undermine. The Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined often involves attacks by one or both sides on the enemy king.\n\nExchange variations involving the exchange of pawns often lead to symmetrical central pawn structures, as in the Slav Defense and the French Defense, among others. The resulting pawn structures may also be asymmetrical, as in the Caro-Kann Defense and Queen's Gambit Declined. In the Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation pieces (White's bishop and Black's knight) rather than pawns are traded. In the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld Defense, both a pair of pawns and a pair of knights are traded.\n\nThe diagram at right shows a position in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, after the moves:\n\nThe position is completely symmetrical and White's advantage is limited to his right to move. The Exchange French is usually regarded as a passive alternative selected by a White player eager for a draw, but Paul Morphy and more recently Garry Kasparov have used it as a winning try.\n\n"}

Many species of plankton are known to display this property of bioluminescence. The mechanisms of this process are not well understood; only that they do not use any of the currently known luciferins.\nIf disturbed, a few species are known to release bioluminescent particles from their parapodia, though possibly all species of \"Tomopteris\" do this. It is thought that this mode is to distract predators, analogous to chaff or flares dispensed from military aircraft during evasive maneuvers.\n\nGenerally they grow to only a few centimeters in overall length, or to in total length, though this is likely to reflect the size of those amenable to being caught in trawl nets.\n"}
{"id": "2152369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152369", "title": "Geoffrey Unsworth", "text": "Geoffrey Unsworth\n\nGeoffrey Gilyard Unsworth, OBE, BSC (26 May 1914 – 28 October 1978) was a British cinematographer who worked on nearly 90 feature films spanning over more than 40 years. He is best known for his work on films such as Stanley Kubrick's \"\", Bob Fosse's \"Cabaret\" and Richard Donner's \"Superman\".\n\nUnsworth began his career working at Gaumont British from 1932 to 1937. Having joined Technicolor in 1938, he acted as assistant director of photography on many notable productions, such as Powell and Pressburger's \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\" (1943) and \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (1946). After working on some of the Gainsborough melodramas, he worked at the Rank Organisation throughout the 1950s, notably on films such as \"A Town Like Alice\" and \"A Night to Remember\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Unsworth's work extended abroad, such as with the 1962 CinemaScope epic \"The 300 Spartans\"; the decade also saw him receive his first Academy Award nomination for his work on 1964's \"Becket\". In 1965, he was responsible for photographing the Royal National Theatre's production of William Shakespeare's \"Othello\".\n\nHis film work brought him an impressive array of awards, including five British Society of Cinematographers awards, three BAFTAS and two Academy Awards. Unsworth was especially in demand as cinematographer in two very different genres, period pieces and science fiction. Among the highlights of his career, he collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the visually innovative \"\" (on which he was assisted by John Alcott, who would become a regular collaborator of Kubrick's) and Bob Fosse's dark musical exploration of the end of Weimar Germany, \"Cabaret\". In Sidney Lumet's 1974 film adaptation of Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express\", his lighting and use of diffusion capture the danger and romance of the train while graceful integration of camera movement and optical effects contributes to the realism of the set while controlling the claustrophobia of the setting.\n\nUnsworth's work reached its widest audience with Richard Donner's \"Superman\" in 1978. He was responsible for integrating the work of a who's-who of cinematographers and visual effects designers (including Zoran Perisic, an animation stand crew member from \"2001\", who extended Kubrick's front projection technique for \"Superman\"), with the plausibility and sense of grandeur befitting a (mostly) reverent take on a superhero. The style he developed alongside director Donner was essentially that of a science-fiction period film; the glamorous, often highly diffused cinematography observed a panoply of images of Americana, suggesting an epic timeframe for the film's scenes, a mythical America somewhere between the 1930s of the original comics and the 1970s. The style of the sequences that did not involve extensive science-fiction elements had to match scenes displaying Superman's powers.\n\nUnsworth's other work in the 1970s included the Oliver Cromwell biopic \"Cromwell\" in 1970, the 1972 John Barry musical \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", John Boorman's 1974 fantasy film \"Zardoz\", \"The Return of the Pink Panther\" (the fourth film in Blake Edwards' \"Pink Panther\" series), Richard Attenborough's 1977 war epic \"A Bridge Too Far\". In 1981, he won a posthumous Oscar for Best Cinematography for his collaborative work with Ghislain Cloquet on Roman Polanski's \"Tess\".\n\nFor \"Superman\", Unsworth was not named in the Special Achievement in Visual Effects Academy Award the film received, but instead as director of photography, and without a separate credit for special effects work, he would not have been eligible. Donner expressed great disgust that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not recognise Unsworth with a nomination for Best Achievement in Cinematography in 1979.\n\nUnsworth died of a heart attack in France at the age of 64 while filming Roman Polanski's \"Tess\" in 1978.\n\nBoth \"Superman\" and \"The First Great Train Robbery\" were dedicated to Unsworth's memory. As alluded to in the \"Superman\" dedication, Unsworth was an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nHe was admired for his charming manner at work. For instance, Margot Kidder was flattered when he arranged lighting for her shots and insisted on concentration by saying \"Quiet, I'm lighting the Lady.\" His partner Maggie worked in the British film industry, often as a script/continuity supervisor.\n\n\n"}

The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1994 and in North America and PAL regions in 1995. It is the direct sequel to \"Mega Man X\", released one year prior. \"Mega Man X2\" takes place in the near future in which humans try to peacefully coexist with intelligent robots called \"Reploids\", with some of the Reploids going \"Maverick\" and threatening daily life. The plot follows the android protagonist X, a \"Maverick Hunter\" who has saved humanity from the evil Sigma six months earlier. A trio of Mavericks calling themselves the \"X-Hunters\" has arisen, intent on destroying X by luring him with bodyparts of his comrade Zero, who died in the conflict with Sigma.\n\n\"Mega Man X2\" features much of the same action-platforming elements as the first installment of the series, following the traditional gameplay of the original \"Mega Man\" series. The player is tasked with completing a series of stages by destroying enemies, gaining various power-ups, and winning the special weapon of each stage's boss. Like the first \"Mega Man X\", this game lets the player dash, scale walls, and obtain access to special abilities via optional pieces of armor. \"Mega Man X2\" is graphically similar to its predecessor as well, but Capcom included the Cx4 in-cartridge enhancement chip to allow for some 3D wireframe effects. The development team was instructed to utilize this technology as much as possible when working on the game.\n\nThe presentation and gameplay of \"Mega Man X2\" have earned the game a mostly positive critical reception. However, reviewers were dismayed by the lack of changes from the original \"Mega Man X\". The game has since gone onto being released on various other platforms. \n\n\"Mega Man X2\" is set in an ambiguous year during the 22nd century (\"21XX\") in which the world is populated both by humans and mechanical beings known as \"Reploids\" (replicant androids). The mass-produced Reploids are based on a complex, humanoid robot dubbed Mega Man X (or simply \"X\") who was discovered by the archaeologist Dr. Cain in laboratory ruins many months earlier. Created with human-level intelligence and free will, some Reploids have a tendency towards destructive, criminal activity and are subsequently dubbed \"Mavericks\" by the government. A military force called the \"Maverick Hunters\" is formed to halt or prevent such activity. The events of the first \"Mega Man X\" game entail the hunter X's fight to stop Sigma, a Maverick overlord bent on the destruction of humanity. X prevails in his mission, but at the cost of his partner Zero's life.\n\nSix months following the incident, X becomes the head of the Maverick Hunters. X tracks a \"manufactured Maverick\" bearing Sigma's emblem to a Reploid factory, where he launches a full assault. However, despite Sigma's apparent death and X's recent efforts, the Maverick rebellion continues. Three powerful Mavericks—Serges, Agile, and Violen—form a group called the \"X-Hunters\" and gain control of the North Pole. In the time between Sigma's demise and the trio's sudden uprising, Serges has collected the deceased Zero's bodyparts. After the factory mission, X is assigned to seek and exterminate eight Maverick leaders on a large continent directly south of the North Pole. The X-Hunters contact the Maverick Hunters shortly thereafter and taunt them with Zero's body. The X-Hunters drift among the eight Maverick locations and attempt to lure X out, each one promising the protagonist a piece of Zero if he can defeat them.\n\nThe story deviates slightly depending on whether or not the player collects all three of Zero's parts before heading to the X-Hunter fortification in the North Pole. If the player gathers all the parts, Dr. Cain states he will attempt to reassemble and reactivate Zero using his original control chip. If the player does not succeed, X is informed by Dr. Cain that the X-Hunters have attacked Maverick Hunter headquarters and stolen any collected parts and the control chip. Just as X annihilates the last of the X-Hunters, Sigma reveals himself to have been behind the plot. X leaves the exploding compound and tracks Sigma to the Central Computer, one of the eight locations he visited earlier. If the player fails to collect all of Zero's parts, X finds both Sigma and the newly rebuilt Zero waiting for him halfway through the stage. X must then beat Zero in combat. If the player does manage to collect all of the parts, a gray-armored clone of Zero accompanies Sigma instead; the real Zero then appears at X's side and destroys the clone. The outcome of either event has Sigma retreating and Zero creating a passageway in the floor to allow X pursuit. After X defeats Sigma, he reveals to X that his true form exists as a computer virus, and taunts to X that he will return. However, Sigma questions Zero's allegiance with humans, stating that Zero is \"the last of the Doctor's creations\". X evacuates the facility to rendezvous with Zero outside, and the two watch as the facility self-destructs.\n\n\"Mega Man X2\" is an action-platform game in the same fashion as the first \"Mega Man X\" and the original \"Mega Man\" series. The player takes on the role of the titular character X, who must traverse and clear a series of eight, side-scrolling stages in the order of the player's choosing. The protagonist's initial abilities include running, jumping, scaling walls, dashing forward to make longer jumps, and firing his chargeable \"X-Buster\" arm cannon. Unlike \"Mega Man X\", the dash is a permanent ability at the start of the game, instead of being an armor upgrade found in a capsule. The player must contend with countless robotic enemies and several platforming hazards such as bottomless pits, deadly spikes, and rising lava. Along the way, the player can pick up extra lives and items that restore health and weapon power. Each stage contains one main boss at the end; defeating the stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be quickly switched to and used in any remaining levels. Every boss is weak to another's weapon, so the player may strategize the order in which the stages are completed.\n\n\"Mega Man X2\" features a number of extra gameplay elements. At certain times, the player can pilot vehicles including an attack mech in Wheel Gator's stage and an attack hovercycle in Overdrive Ostrich's stage. Each of the eight stages contains an optional entrance for a battle with one of the three X-Hunters, should the player select that stage when one of them is present. Defeating an X-Hunter will earn the player a piece of Zero, which may affect the storyline late in the game. Like the first \"Mega Man X\", players can locate and acquire numerous hidden power-ups. \"Heart Tanks\" extend the player's maximum life bar, \"Sub-Tanks\" store life energy for later use, and armor upgrade capsules grant a set of new abilities. For example, the leg part will allow the player to perform a dash in mid-air, while the X-Buster part will allow for two charged blasts in succession. When specific conditions are met a special capsule is unlocked in one of the game's final stages, allowing X to perform a one-shot kill attack (the \"Shoryuken\") used by characters from Capcom's \"Street Fighter\" series.\n\n\"Mega Man X2\" was developed by a team at Capcom, which included artists Hayato Kaji and Keiji Inafune, as well as designers Sho Tsuge, and Yoshihisa Tsuda. A majority of the people who worked on \"Mega Man X2\" had either been heavily involved with the development of the first \"Mega Man X\" or were completely new to the franchise. Inafune was \"hands-off\" with the art design in \"Mega Man X2\". He instead began focusing more on planning, producing, and story writing for the newer series beginning with this title. According to Tsuda, it was Inafune's decision to bring Zero back to life in \"Mega Man X2\" simply because he thought it would be \"a shame\" to keep him dead. Inafune felt particularly attached to Zero, a character whom he had designed and originally intended to be the main protagonist of the \"X\" series. Even though Inafune had mostly relinquished his character design duties in \"Mega Man X2\", he refused to allow any drastic changes to the illustration of Zero.\n\nThe game's antagonists, the X-Hunters, were present as several illustrations within Inafune's sketchbook prior to the completion of the first \"Mega Man X\". Their aesthetic features were combined to create the basis for Sigma's design in \"Mega Man X\"; the three designs were then fleshed out as three separate characters for the sequel. The team had planned to include a fourth, female X-Hunter and were going to denote them as the \"Four Guardians\". However, both this character and Violen's second form were cut from the final version of the game due to a lack of resources. In creating the eight, ancillary Maverick bosses, the development team considered holding public, fan submissions as they had done with several games in the original \"Mega Man\" series. They ultimately decided against the idea as they wanted to further establish a contrast between the two series. Tsuge elaborated, \"With \"Mega Man\", we wanted the players to feel a certain familiarity with the characters, but it was our intention that the \"X\" series would have a world with a more hardcore feel to it. We didn't want the bosses in this world to be cute products of kids' imaginations, we needed them to be solid characters refined by professionals.\"\n\n\"Mega Man X2\" has an in-cartridge enhancement by Capcom called the Cx4 chip, a digital signal processor which allows for limited 3D graphical effects like rotation, enlarging, and shrinking of wireframe objects. The company held weekly meetings devoted to utilizing the chip to its maximum potential in \"Mega Man X2\". Tsuge commented that the Cx4 was their \"greatest adversary to date\" as they were instructed to use it in as many ways as possible. The musical score for \"Mega Man X2\" was chiefly composed by Yuki Iwai. Others, such as Ippo Yamada, were involved in some of the game's sound production. Tsuge wanted the Flame Stag stage theme cut from the game, but the song was kept due to its popularity among the development staff. Additionally, the game's ending theme was originally its final boss track. As the team felt it was more appropriate for the ending music, it was slightly altered and made as such. The \"Mega Man X2\" soundtrack, featuring the original SNES instrumentals, was included as part of the \"Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6\" compilation released by Suleputer in 2003.\n\nThe game was released in Japan on December 16, 1994 and in North America and PAL regions in 1995. \"Mega Man X2\" was included in the \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2) in North America in 2006. The game was also released on Japanese mobile phones in 2008 and 2009 and worldwide on the Virtual Console in 2011 and 2012 for the Wii and in 2013/2014 for the Wii U.\n\nIn 2006, \"Mega Man X2\" was included as part of the North American \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the GameCube and PS2. A version for i-mode and EZweb-compatible mobile phones was made available in Japan between 2008 and 2009. \"Mega Man X2\" was released on the Wii Virtual Console service in Japan on December 27, 2011, in PAL regions on May 31, 2012, and in North America on June 14, 2012. It was ported for the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch as part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection\" (\"Rockman X Anniversary Collection\" in Japan) which was released on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan.\n\nReception for \"Mega Man X2\" has been primarily positive by virtue of its graphics, sound, and a persistently enjoyable gameplay model which critics and fans of the \"Mega Man\" series had come to expect. Comparing the game to the first \"Mega Man X\", \"GamePro\"s Chris Nicolella called \"Mega Man X2\" \"improved in almost every way\". Nicolella summarized, \"The new C4 chip energizes the already great graphics, the extremely responsive controls are perfect and the levels contain more enemies and hidden locations than any \"MM\" cart yet.\" Dave Halverson of \"GameFan\" likewise enjoyed the level designs and judged the new armor abilities and the music to be better than the original \"Mega Man X\". GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer were appreciative of Capcom's attempt at expanding \"Mega Man X2\" over its predecessor in all aspects, especially the story, which they called \"involving ... with engaging characters\". \n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the SNES version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"This is one series in need of a serious overhaul. And despite it all, the little blue guy is just as unbearably fun as he always was.\"\n\nThe game has made it to several lists of best games for the Super Nintendo console. IGN named \"Mega Man X2\" as the 31st-best game in its list of the top 100 SNES games of all time. \"Following up the explosive debut of the \"Mega Man X\" series was no small task,\" the website abstracted, \"but \"Mega Man X2\" accomplished the job admirably.\"\n\n"}

It is usually mounted vertically, with the disc at the top and the cone beneath.\n\nOmnidirectional, vertically polarized and with gain similar to a dipole, it is exceptionally wideband, offering a frequency range ratio of up to approximately 10:1. The radiation pattern in the vertical plane is quite narrow, making its sensitivity highest in the direction of the horizon and rather less for signals coming from relatively close by.\n\nOn February 6, 1945, Armig G. Kandoian of New York City was awarded U.S. patent number 2,368,663 (assignor to Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation (later merged with ITT Corporation) for a \"broad band antenna\", from an application made on May 15, 1943.\n\nExcerpt from the Kandoian patent:\n\nIn keeping with progress made during the last few years in the development of ultra-high frequency radio technique, and applications thereof to aircraft communication, direction finding, and so forth, it has become necessary to develop special antennas and antenna systems suitable for installation on such aircraft. Flying conditions are such that these antennas must necessarily be small and rigid in their construction and also offer a minimum of wind resistance, in order that the flying efficiency of the aircraft will be unimpaired. In accordance with my invention I have provided a small rigid antenna suitable for mounting on the surface of the fuselage or other component of the airplane structure and in certain embodiments I have also provided a streamlined protecting shield or housing covering or so cooperating with the construction of the antenna system as to greatly reduce wind resistance. \n\nThe discone antenna has a useful frequency range of at least 10 to 1. When employed as a transmitting antenna, it is often less efficient than an antenna designed for a more limited frequency range. SWR (standing wave ratio) is typically 1.5:1 or less over several octaves of frequency. A discone antenna consists of three main parts: the disc, the cone, and the insulator.\n\n\nA discone may be made from solid metal sheet (often copper), which is practical for small indoor UHF antennas, such as for Wi-Fi.\n\nAt lower frequencies a sufficient number of metal wires or rods in a spoke configuration is often used to approximate a solid surface. This simplifies construction and reduces wind loading.\nThe spokes may be made of stiff wire, brazing rods or even coat hanger wire.\n\nThe optimal number of rods comprising the disc and cone is often quoted as being from 8 to 16.\n\nThe discone's wideband coverage makes it attractive in commercial, military, amateur radio and radio scanner applications.\n\nThe discone's inherently wideband nature permits it to broadcast undesirable spurious emissions from faulty or improperly filtered transmitters.\n\nA vertical whip may be affixed to the center of the disc in order to extend the low frequency response, but this may compromise efficiency at higher frequencies. In this configuration, at lower frequencies the discone may more closely resemble a ground plane antenna or a coaxial dipole.\n\n\n"}

FIDE awarded him the International Master title in 1975 and the International Grandmaster title in 1976. Balinas was a lawyer by profession, as well as a chess writer and journalist.\n\nBalinas was considered the strongest Asian player during the 1960s and early 1970s, before the emergence of compatriot Eugenio Torre. Balinas won international chess tournaments in Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, and Odessa, USSR during the period. At the 1966 17th Chess Olympiad in Havana, Cuba, Balinas scored 15½ points out of 20 games (.775) and was awarded the individual silver medal award, behind gold medalist, former world champion Mikhail Tal, who scored 11 points out of 13 games (.846).

He shared first place at the Meralco-sponsored 1968 Philippine Open championship with world championship candidate Yugoslav grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić.\n\nIn 1975, then-IM Balinas achieved a 5-5 score at the Manila Marlboro Classic International Chess Tournament, one-half point short of the grandmaster norm, tying with Gligoric for 6th-7th place. Balinas defeated world championship candidates Lev Polugaevsky of USSR and Bent Larsen of Denmark, as well as the Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek.\n\nBalinas achieved his greatest victory at the 1976 Odessa International Tournament, winning with a 10–4 score. Balinas was undefeated against all Soviet opponents, and a point ahead of Lev Alburt, and former Soviet champion Vladimir Savon.\n\nBobby Ang, a Philippine chess columnist of \"Indo Chess\" and \"Philippine Business World\", recounted in his Chess Piece column:\n\n\"Vladimir Savon, the Absolute Russian Chess champion pre-tournament favorite, had been upset in the second round by Tseitlin and it was Balinas who jumped into the lead scoring 5/6.

Since January 2003 it is a battalion-sized formation that forms the garrison of the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos.\n\nThe regiment was established, along with the other four Evzone regiments of the Hellenic Army, by Royal Decree on 23 December 1913. Its base was at Lamia, and it came under the command of 13th Infantry Division in Chalkis.\n\nThe first years of its history are relatively obscure, largely because the relevant archives were destroyed both in the aftermath of the National Schism of 1916 and during the Axis occupation of Greece in World War II. The regiment certainly participated in the mobilization of 10 September 1915, and remained in wartime strength until the demobilization, forced on Greece (then still neutral) by the Allied Powers, on 26 May 1916. As part of the Allied demands, most of the Greek army was evacuated to the Peloponnese; doubtlessly the 5/42 Regiment was part of this.\n\nFollowing Greece's entry into World War I on the side of the Allies in June 1917, the Greek army began to be re-formed. The 5/42 Regiment began its mobilization on 16 January 1918, and after reaching its full strength moved by ship to Thessaloniki, where it completed its training by the end of May 1918. As part of 13th Division, in June the regiment was moved to the Macedonian front along the Strymon River, occupying positions between the Achinos Lake and the village of Agia Eleni. During September, the regiment conducted a reconnaissance in force mission to ascertain enemy strength in its sector, in preparation for the great Allied offensive of that month. In October, as the rest of 13th Division was withdrawn to participate in the northward advance of I Army Corps, the regiment took over the entire front sector of the division. On 16 September, Bulgaria signed the Armistice of Salonica, obliging it to evacuate all Greek and Serbian territory it occupied. As a result, on 3 October the 5/42 Regiment was ordered to reoccupy the port city of Kavala. The Bulgarian garrison initially refused to comply with the armistice terms, but after the regiment took battle positions outside the city, the Bulgarians agreed to withdraw.\n\nDespite its participation in the front, the regiment was regarded as highly problematic: most of its recruits and officers, including its commander, Colonel Kontos, were loyal to King Constantine I, who had been ousted by the Allies in June 1917, allowing Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos to bring Greece into the war. Dissatisfaction was so rife that in August 1918 the regiment was the centre of a conspiracy, which included the other units of the 13th Division as well, to defect to the Bulgarians. The conspiracy was thwarted at the last moment due to happen-stance. The unit was furthermore plagued by indiscipline, with soldiers and even officers plundering the local peasants, particularly Turks.\n\nIt was at that point that command was assumed by Lt. Colonel Nikolaos Plastiras, who had until then commanded the 6th Regiment of the Archipelago Division, part of the staunchly Venizelist Army of National Defence. As such, his first contact with his men was marked by barely disguised hostility, with soldiers muttering that they would should him as soon as they got into combat. The regiment was slated to be part of the Greek expeditionary force in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and Plastiras tried to raise morale by pointing out that the expedition was in support of Greek territorial claims on Smyrna and Asia Minor. Plastiras soon managed to instil discipline, reform and re-equip the unit, which under his command distinguished itself over the following three years of campaigning.\nThe regiment remained at Kavala until February 1919. On 28 February, it embarked at Eleftheres for the Ukraine, on board the passenger liners \"Imperator Nikolai\" and \"Patris\". The regiment disembarked at Odessa on 4 March. Ten days later it was sent to reinforce the northeastern sector of the Allied front at Serbka. In the evening of 16 March it relieved the 3rd Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting against superior Bolshevik forces for ten days without interruption. Plastiras took over command of two other Greek battalions from the 3rd and 34th regiments, as well as local French cavalry, engineers, and artillery units, and formed a tactical detachment, which gave the regiment the name under which it became famous: \"Plastiras Detachment\" (Απόσπασμα Πλαστήρα). On 17 March the detachment repelled Bolshevik attacks and, launching a counterattack, pursued them beyond their original starting lines. Renewed offensives on the 18th were also repulsed, but the withdrawal of French units elsewhere along the front forced the 5/42 Regiment to likewise withdraw. The following five days (19–23 March) were spent in a continuous fighting retreat, until the Allied high command negotiated their safe withdrawal to Bessarabia. On 29 March, the 5/42 Regiment crossed the Dniester River to Romanian territory. Along with the other Allied forces, the 5/42 Regiment occupied defensive positions along the Dniester to prevent the Bolsheviks from crossing it until 17 May, when it was relieved by Romanian troops. As with the rest of 13th Division, it gradually withdrew through Romania over the next month, until embarking for Smyrna from Galați on 15 June.\n\nThe regiment's experience in Ukraine, albeit brief, resulted in an innovation that characterized it under Plastiras' command: due to their contact with the Russians, especially the Cossacks, the Evzones had acquired horses, and Plastiras formed a small mounted detachment of Evzones. Gradually, the unit was expanded over the next few years with captured horses. In Asia Minor, it provided valuable reconnaissance services, making contact and dismounting to fight while the rest of the regiment caught up; its infantrymen even held their own in clashes against the formidable Turkish cavalry.\n\nThe 5/42 Evzone Regiment arrived at Smyrna on 19 June. From there the regiment marched to the front, relieving the 5th Archipelago Regiment near Manisa on 28 June. The regiment had its first clash with the Turkish nationalists on 8 July, when it repelled attack by Turkish irregulars against the village of Papazli, killing 5 and taking 25 enemy prisoners. Another attack by an 800-strong force on 29 July was also repulsed, with 90 casualties among the attackers. The regiment retained and strengthened its positions around Manisa for the next three months. In November, however, the Supreme Allied Council allowed the Greek army to advance beyond the original limits of the Greek zone of occupation, and the 5/42 Regiment occupied new forward positions on 19–22 November. The regiment participated with one company in a local attack by the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment on 8 January 1920, but otherwise the period until the beginning of the Greek summer offensive in June 1920 was relatively tranquil.\n\nDuring the 1920 summer offensive, the regiment captured Akhisar (Axari), followed by Gelembe (12 June), Balıkesir (16 June), and Ömerköy (19 June), where it linked up with the Mixed Brigade of the Xanthi Division, that had landed at Bandırma on the same day. From 23 June to 23 August it occupied defensive positions in the Susurluk–Kepsut area. On 24 August it began moving south to Elvadar in the area of Alaşehir, and from there, on 10 October, to Uşak. On 15 October the regiment took over the salient at Gediz, and three days later advanced further to take over the front subsector of Dosecık. A Turkish attack on the Gediz sector was repelled, and the Greek forces were able to occupy strong defensive positions. As contact with the retreating Turkish forces was lost, on 3 November two companies of the 5/42 Regiment carried out a reconnaissance in force in a depth of 7–10 kilometres, engaging and destroying two enemy groups of 100 men each.\n\nFrom 6 November 1920 until March 1921, the regiment occupied defensive positions in the Selvioğlu—Kada area west of Uşak. During that time, in Greece, a decisive political change occurred, when Venizelos was defeated and the royalist opposition took power in the November 1920 elections. In its aftermath, most of the commanders in the Asia Minor front, who were mostly Venizelist, were replaced by royalist appointees. Although most of the men of the 5/42 Regiment were themselves royalist and anti-Venizelist, by this time their esprit de corps and identification with Plastiras was so strong, that the latter was retained in command of the regiment by the new government.\n\nThe regiment participated in the spring offensive of 1921, that ended with the Second Battle of İnönü. It began its advance on 10 March, at the head of the 13th Division's column, occupied the passes between Tokutepe and Tezler Karlık on the 11th, descended the northern slopes of Akar Dağ despite the heavy snow which in many places reached the height of a man (1.7 m), and occupied the line Güney Tezler on the 12th. On the 13th, the regiment reached the Cakirsaz–Yağcılar heights, where it came into contact with the main Turkish forces. On 6:00 on the next day, the regiment launched a frontal attack with its 1st and 2nd Battalions, while the 3rd Battalion launched a flanking manoeuvre to the enemy left. The threat of encirclement forced the Turks to withdraw, allowing the regiment to capture the Cakirsaz heights and enter the city of Afyonkarahisar on the same day. Over the next five days, the regiment advanced east some 15 kilometres, and captured the town of Çay on the 20th. However, despite the successes achieved in the southern sector of the front, assigned to I Army Corps, in the north the III Army Corps failed to achieve its objectives. As a result, the Army of Asia Minor broke off the offensive and ordered the I Army Corps to withdraw from its gains to the area of Dumlupınar. The 5/42 Regiment withdrew to Balmahmut, and thence to positions south of Dumlupınar on 26 March. On 28–29 March the regiment participated in the repulsion of the Turkish attack on the new Greek positions, by a manoeuvre towards Ali Veran, where it succeeded in dispersing significant Turkish infantry and cavalry forces.\n\nFrom 1 April it was stationed at Elma Dağ, and then at Derbent, where it assembled as part of the preparations for a summer offensive. The second Greek summer offensive began on 24 June 1920. On 24–25 June, the 5/42 Regiment advanced to its starting positions at Alaba. It began its attack on 29, and within the day advanced to new positions north and northeast of the town of Altıntaş. On 2–3 July the regiment's advance was halted due to strong Turkish resistance, but the advance of II Army Corps forced the Turks to withdraw, and the regiment continued its advance towards Seyitgazi, reaching the heights southeast of the town on 7 July. On 8 July it captured the Düztepe heights by storm, and repulsed strong Turkish counterattacks during the night. The regiment remained at Düztepe as a covering force until 31 July, occupying the right flank o 13th Division.\n\nWhen the Greek high command decided to continue operations towards Ankara, the 5/42 Regiment advanced east through the northern reaches of the salt desert around Lake Tuz; the march lasted from 1–10 August. With the start of the Battle of Sakarya, on the 12th the regiment attacked the flank of the Turkish 1st Group of Divisions, in the direction of Bakal Dağ. On the next day, it attacked the heights of Karatepe and captured the western portion of the Kaltakli plateau. On 14–15 August, the regiment captured the area south of the Karasuleymanlı village. On the night of 24 August, it repulsed a night attack by the Turkish forces, and another strong attack on the next day. On 28–29 the regiment was moved to the left flank of the Army of Asia Minor, and crossed the Sakarya River on the 30th, occupying new defensive positions north of Çandakoğlu Dere, covering the right flank of 13th Division.\n\nFollowing the Greek retreat from Sakarya, the regiment continued covering the right of 13th Division, but sent its 2nd Battalion to reinforce the 12th Infantry Division on 2 September. On 27 September, the regiment occupied defensive positions between the heights north of Hayren Baba to the ravine of Ayaz In. There it remained until March 1922, when it handed over the Ayaz In subsector to the 5th Infantry Division. One battalion established a fortified centre at Ruklu Dağ, while the remainder of the regiment was kept in the reserve. On 29 March, the Ruklu Dağ section was handed over to 3rd Infantry Regiment, and the regiment was wholly placed in reserve of the I Army Corps. On 13 June it was moved to Çakırsaz, with one battalion at Afyonkarahisar.\n\nOn 26 August 1922, the Turkish army launched a major and decisive offensive. The regiment was ordered forward to cover 4th Infantry Division's right flank, and plug the gap between it and the neighbouring 1st Infantry Division, at the Kalecik subsector. On the same evening, the regiment's 3rd company recaptured the strongpoint of Katsimpali, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions established advance guards at the Kalecik subsector; the 3rd Battalion arrived at the area at dawn of the 14th, after marching through the night. The regiment spent the entire day repulsing Turkish attacks supported by heavy artillery fire. The regiment launched counterattacks, but the 1st and 3rd Battalions suffered heavy losses, forcing them to withdraw, covered by 2nd Battalion. With great difficulty, and after suffering over 600 killed, the regiment managed to occupy new positions on the Beltepe heights; at 18:30, it received the order to withdraw. The withdrawal was carried out during the night: passing south of the Köprülü heights, held by the 23rd Infantry Regiment, the Evzones arrived at the train line some 3 km west of the Balmahmut rail station, where they stopped. On the next day, the regiment continued its retreat towards the Dumlupınar heights, and established new defensive positions at Hasan Dede Tepe in the evening. On the 16th, it repulsed an attack by a Turkish regimental-sized force. During the next day, the V and XIII cavalry demi-companies and the regiment's own mounted detachment arrived, having passed through the Turkish lines. Due to the advance of the Turks on both of its flanks, and in order to avoid being cut off, Plastiras again decided to withdraw, with the 3rd Battalion covering the rear. On the 18th, marching through mountainous and wooded terrain, the retreating Evzones were attacked by another regimental-sized Turkish force, but repelled it, and reached the foothills of Elma Dağ around midnight.\n\nThe 5/42 Regiment managed to re-establish contact with the other Greek forces, specifically the remnants of the 1st Division, at 11:00 on 19 August. Along with what remained of 1st Division's 2nd and 3rd Infantry Regiments, the 5/42 Regiment continued its retreat until reaching Takmak on the evening of 20 August. By the next day, the 5/42 Evzone Regiment remained as the only cohesive and battle-worthy formation in the entire II Army Corps area. On the initiative of Plastiras, the regiment did not follow the remaining forces of the Corps, but remained as a rear guard, originally placed in reserve to 7th Infantry Division northeast of Kiranköy. Later that same day, it was ordered to occupy the Beskaya Dağ heights to cover 7th Division's left flank. A Turkish column moving to occupy Ak Taş made contact with the regiment's new positions, and was torn apart by concentrated infantry and artillery fire. During the night, the withdrawal resumed, with the Evzones as 7th Division's rear guard. On the evening of the next day, it arrived at the village of Paklacık, and thence to the rail station of Alaşehir, where it embarked on trains, arriving at Salihli around midnight. At daybreak on the 23rd, it became clear that Salihli was surrounded by strong Turkish infantry and cavalry forces, but after a three-hour battle, together with elements of the Cavalry Division, the Evzones managed to force the Turkish forces to disperse and withdraw.\n\nThe regiment remained at Salihli until 05:00 of 24 August, when it rejoined 13th Division, marching towards Kasaba (modern Turgutlu), where it arrived on 02:00 of 25 August. Later on the same day the regiment was ordered to occupy positions on the southeastern slopes of Mount Nif, but on its way there it was recalled and ordered instead to make for Burnabaşi, where it arrived on 21:00. There it remained during the next day, setting off at 01:00 of 27 August for Kozağaç, where it arrived on 07:00. The regiment guarded the flanks of the Southern Group, allowing its main column to escape to safety; a small Turkish irregular force attacked but was repulsed. The regiment set off again on 14:00 for Akçekaya, where it arrived six hours later. From the morning of 28 August, the 5/42 Regiment covered the retreat of the remaining Greek forces through the Çeşme peninsula to the coast, marching through Gülbahçe, Güneli, and Lestren Dağ, where it arrived at noon on the 29th. It remained there until midnight on 31 August, when it moved towards Alaçatı, occupying positions west of Zeytineli in order to cover the embarkation of the other units. Finally, on 2 September, the regiment moved to Çeşme, where it embarked on ships for Chios. During the war, the regiment enjoyed a formidable reputation among the Turks: the regiment was known as \"Şeytan asker\" (\"Satan's army\"), and Plastiras as \"Karapiper\" (\"black pepper\").\n\nThe military units that escaped the disaster in Asia Minor launched the anti-royalist 11 September 1922 Revolution, headed by Plastiras, Colonel Stylianos Gonatas as representative of the army units in Lesbos and Commander Dimitrios Fokas as representative of the Navy.\n\nThe 5/42 Regiment embarked at Chios on the same day, and arrived at Lavrion on the evening of 15 September, along with other army units. Following the renewed resignation of King Constantine I, the revolutionary army units disembarked at Piraeus and Faliron. The new revolutionary government ordered the demobilization of I Army Corps, and the dismissal of the oldest reserve classes. As a result, the 5/42 Regiment demobilized and returned to its peacetime garrison at Lamia.\n\nThe 5/42 Regiment remained at its garrison in Lamia throughout the interwar period, which in Greece saw the establishment short-lived and troubled Second Hellenic Republic (1924–1935).\n\nIts history during this period is obscure, but it does not appear to have taken part in the frequent coups and counter-coups of the period, until the Venizelist coup attempt of 1 March 1935 against the conservative and pro-royalist government. As part of the coup, which was led by none other than Plastiras, IV Army Corps in eastern Macedonia mutinied. General Georgios Kondylis, the Minister for Military Affairs, mobilized forces against the rebels, including a thousand-strong detachment from the 5/42 Regiment under its deputy commander, Panagiotis Raftodimos. The detachment arrived by rail at the village of Kalokastro, near the Strymon River, on 3 March, and bivouacked in a ravine. It took part in the forced crossing of the river on 10 March, and arrived near Serres by afternoon. Following this attack, the rebel leadership gave up and fled to Bulgaria on 11 March, signalling the collapse of the coup. The Evzones then returned to Lamia by rail.\n\nOn 4 September 1935, as part of a reorganization of the Army, the regiment received the new designation 42nd Evzone Regiment (42ο Σύνταγμα Ευζώνων, 42 ΣΕ).\n\nOn 28 November 1935, the late Queen Sophia, the mother of the reigning King George II, was declared the regiment's honorary colonel-in-chief. Its men thereafter wore the royal cypher, a capital sigma topped by a crown (golden for staff officers, silver for junior officers, red for NCOs and other ranks), on their epaulettes.\n\nThe probability of an Italian attack increased over the summer of 1940 after a series of provocations culminating in the sinking of the cruiser \"Elli\" by an Italian submarine on 15 August. As a result, on 27 August – 2 September the regiment began secret mobilization through individual call-up papers, which from 29 August was complemented by a full, public mobilization. The regimental commander at this time was Colonel Ippokratis Papadimitropoulos. He remained in command until 4 December 1940, when he was replaced by Col. Georgios Papageorgiou. Col. Papageorgiou led the regiment until 6 March 1941. The identity of his replacement is unknown.\n\nOn 3 September, the regiment began moving towards the border with Albania (under Italian control since 1939). Battalion by battalion was moved by train to Kalambaka, and thence marched through Metsovo and Ioannina to Delvinaki. The move was completed on 8 September. The regiment came under the command of the local 8th Infantry Division, with the following disposition: 1st Battalion at Zitsa, 2nd Battalion plus an artillery section as a covering force in the Ktismata–Delvinaki area, and 3rd Battalion in the Sitaria–Parakalamos area.\n\nAlong with the neighbouring 15th Infantry Regiment, the 42nd Regiment faced the Italian armoured division \"Centauro\". The Italian invasion of Greece began on 28 October with an artillery bombardment followed by an infantry attack against the regiment's covering elements. As a result, the 2nd Battalion withdrew to the south of Delvinaki, and on the next day regrouped at Mazaraki. On the same day, the regiment established its three battalions in defensive positions along the line Chavos Height–Makrynoros–Sossinou Monastery–Repetista. From 30 October to 4 November, the regiment withstood enemy bombardment and repulsed minor Italian attacks, while strengthening its positions. On the night of 4/5 November, the regiment was ordered to retreat to a line between Agios Ilias height and Vrontismeni. 1st and 3rd Battalion, along with the 2nd Machine-Gun Battalion, were deployed on the line, while 2nd Battalion was kept in reserve. The new line was kept under bombardment for two consecutive days, but on the night of 10/11 November, the regiment carried out a reconnaissance in force towards the Siastis height that resulted in the capture of 90 prisoners.\n\nOn 13 November, as part of the general Greek counter-offensive, the 42nd Regiment advanced towards the direction of Kouklioi and Sossinou Monastery. On 14–17 November the regiment advanced up to the heights north of Kouklioi and Grimbiani, and recaptured the villages of Repetista, Sitaria, and Kryoneri. On the evening of the 17th, the regiment was reinforced with the 3rd Battalion/36th Infantry Regiment. On 18–20 November, the Evzones took the Profitis Ilias and Rouitsa heights by storm, capturing 350 prisoners, 45 mules and 4 machine guns, along with relevant materiel. On 20 November the regiment retook control of the Delvinaki pass and 2nd Battalion moved north into Pogoni. During the next five days the regiment advanced in a three-pronged attack to Ktismata, Zavrocho, and the heights above Teriachi. The regiment continued its advance with multiple offensive actions, and captured the heights east of the villages of Argyrochori, Chrysodouli, and Agios Nikolaos by 30 November. It failed, however, to capture Height 669. The height was finally captured on 5 December after successive attacks.\n\nFrom 6 December the regiment was withdrawn from the front line and moved north to the Ano Episkopi–Kato Episkopi area for rest, except for 1st Battalion, which was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, and the 2nd Battalion, which was assigned to I Army Corps. On 9 December the 3rd Battalion/36th Regiment rejoined its parent unit. On 29–31 December the regiment marched from Episkopi through Lazarat, Gjirokastër, and Çepunë to Kolonjë. There it went into quarters, and took over command of the 1st Battalion/40th Evzone Regiment as well. On 1–2 January 1941, the 3rd Battalion was moved to the front sector held by the 11th Infantry Regiment in the Mali Shpat heights south of Tepelenë. There it launched an attack on 3 January, but it failed with heavy casualties. On 4–5 January, 1st Battalion too was moved to the Mali Shpat sector, replacing elements of the 8th Infantry Regiment. The regiment took over the sector held by 11th Regimemt, which was moved to the rear. The regiment held its positions until 26 January. The heavy winter weather reduced activity on both sides apart from an attack launched on 16 January by 1st Battalion, which failed due to the strong Italian defences. On 27 January, the regiment was replaced at the front by the 85th Infantry Regiment and withdrawn to the rear in the Kolonjë–Golem area for rest and recuperation. In early February, 2nd Battalion was released from I Army Corps and rejoined the regiment.\n\nOn 12 March, the regiment, reinforced with 1st Battalion/40th Regiment, again took over the front sector of northern Mali Shpat, replacing the 85th Regiment. On 24 March, the regiment's 1st Battalion returned from its assignment to 3rd Division, allowing the 1st Battalion/40th Regiment to return to its parent unit. During this period, the Italian forces launched a number of attacks on the regiment's lines, but were repulsed. On 13–15 April, however, with heavy artillery support, the Italians managed to break through the 9th Company (3rd Battalion). The regiment launched a counterattack, but the Greek artillery was unable to offer support due to lack of shells, and the operation failed. The front was finally plugged by reinforcements from the 34th Infantry Regiment.\n\nFollowing the start of the German invasion of Greece on 6 April and the rapid progress of the German troops with the capture of Thessaloniki three days later, on 12 April the Greek high command in Athens gave the order of retreat to the Greek forces on the Albanian front. On 16 April, the regiment began its withdrawal on the orders of 8th Division, from Mali Shpat to Kolonjë, Kardhiq, and Çepunë, and established new positions on the heights north of the Gjirokastër barracks on the 16th. The regiment repelled new enemy attacks on 18 April, but on the same night was ordered to withdraw. The regiment retreated from Gjirokastër, to the area of Bularat and Vodhinë, establishing new positions north and west of Vodhinë. Elsewhere the German advance, the lack of motor transport, and the sheer physical exhaustion of the Greek forces meant that the ordered retreat descended into chaos; over the next days, commanders reported signs of disintegration among some Greek units. As a result, on 20 April Lt. General Georgios Tsolakoglou made contact with the German army (the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade) and signed a protocol of surrender of the Greek army in Epirus. The 42nd Regiment maintained its position, repelling an Italian attack on 20 April, but on the same evening, it received news of the armistice. Despite the armistice, the Italians attacked on the next day, but were repulsed.\n\nOn 22 April the regiment recommenced its southward retreat to Krioner. On the 23rd it crossed the pre-war border, moving through Kouklioi and Mazaraki to Zitsa. On 24 April it moved to the village of Grammeno and then the village of Dramesioi. The regiment remained there on 25–26 April, gathering its weapons and materiel and, following orders by 8th Division, storing it in the village school. The keys were deposited in the local Gendarmerie station. On 27 April, the regiment began moving south, and arrived in the area of Filippiada on the 30th. There those soldiers who desired to, were released to return home as best they could. The remainder of the regiment moved to Arta and Amfilochia. On 3 May, the regiment was allowed to disband; over the next three days its men returned to Lamia via Karpenisi and Lianokladi.\n\nDuring the subsequent Axis occupation of Greece, in April 1943 Colonel Dimitrios Psarros re-founded the 5/42 Evzone Regiment as the armed wing of the National and Social Liberation (EKKA) resistance group. The unit remained active until forcibly dissolved by the rival Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) in April 1944. Psarros was killed while in ELAS custody.\n\nIn April 1948, the 53rd Brigade (53η Ταξιαρχία) was formed at Larissa, with the 593rd, 601st, and 603rd Infantry Battalions, as part of II Army Corps. In summer 1948, it fought in the Battle of Grammos–Vitsi. From September 1948 it became an integral part of the 1st Infantry Division. As such it was assigned to I Army Corps in 1949 and participated in the decisive Operation Pyrsos, that expelled the communist forces from their strongholds on Grammos and Vitsi and ended the civil war in a government victory.\n\nOn 30 April 1951, the 53rd Brigade was renamed into 5/42 Infantry Regiment, based at Kolokouri near Katerini, under the command of the 1st Infantry Division. The regiment remained active until disbanded on 26 June 1954.\n\nThe unit was reactivated as a reserve formation on 1 January 1979 at Veroia in replacement of the 81st Infantry Regiment, and moved to Skydra in December. In November 2000 it received the honorific title \"Delvinaki\". Since January 2003 it forms the garrison of the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos. It is a battalion-sized formation under the 80th National Guard Higher Command.\n\n"}
{"id": "2152406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152406", "title": "Hong Kong Club", "text": "Hong Kong Club\n\nThe Hong Kong Club () is the first Gentlemen's club in Hong Kong. Opened on 26 May 1846, it is a private business and dining club in the heart of Central, Hong Kong. Its members were (and still are) among the most influential people in the city, including such personalities as senior government officials, senior local businessmen, the heads of the major trading firms, and many legal and accounting professionals. It was often referred to simply as \"\"The Club\"\". The club's first premises were situated on Queen's Road at the junction with D'Aguilar Street.\n\nThe 2014/15 Chairman was Michael Button who succeeded David Holdsworth in May 2014.\n\nThe Club was an exclusive Gentlemen's club set up by British merchants and civil servants, to \"create a greater community of feeling among these classes\". At the outset, an entrance fee of $30 was payable , and monthly subscription fees of $4 were charged quarterly in advance. Facilities included guest rooms charged at $1 per night, dining rooms and bars, and a billiards room\n\nThe Club has often been described as the seat of real power in the colony: \"Here the Governor and senior civil servants would sit in regular, informal sessions, usually over breakfast or lunch, with members of the commercial elite\". In 1877, the club witnessed an assault by a British sergeant who was enraged by the privileges of the official and merchant classes. The lone assailant wandered into the club brandishing a sword, swinging it at the lamps and chandeliers, and menacing members saying: \"You're one of them\".\n\nThe Club moved into new premises in Jackson Road in 1897, and the old premises became home for the short-lived 'New Club', a residential club whose members were almost entirely master mariners.\n\nGovernor Sir Cecil Clementi (1925–30) believed the club to be too exclusive, and suggested abolishing it, and replacing it with a club whose membership would be open to all races.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the club was said to be running at a deficit. In 1978, it recorded a deficit of HK$200,000 after including investment income of HK$883,000, and members accused the General Committee of poor management.\n\nIn May 1981, a group of members fighting to preserve the Victorian clubhouse built in 1897 called an Emergency General Meeting with a motion to wind up the club and distribute its assets. The motion was rejected by 451:147.\n\nRules of membership were strict: Membership was restricted to British merchants and civil servants, women and people of unsuitable background being banned.\n\nMembership remained exclusive to white British subjects until membership rules were eased in the late 1970s. Some parts of the club premises were off-limits to women. One former member is quoted as saying \"\"there was nothing in the rules to say that Chinese couldn't join. It had simply been understood that you didn't put a Chinese up for membership\". There were reportedly few Chinese members as recently as in the early 1980s. The Sex Discrimination Ordinance, which came into force in 1996, eventually forced its doors open to women.\n\nThe club reportedly had 1,218 members on its membership register in 1981. In 2007, the club has some 1,400 members, of which 70% are expatriates.\n\nCurrently there are about 1,550 members.\n\nThe Hong Kong Club building is currently in its third generation, in its second location. Prior to its 1980s redevelopment the previous Hong Kong Club Building was famous for being one of the last examples of Victorian architecture in Hong Kong. The first clubhouse was constructed on the corner of D'Aguilar St and Queen's Road. The cost of its construction, together with furniture, of £15,000 was financed through an issue of shares of £100 each.\n\nOn 16 February 1895, the Club was granted a 99-year lease on the current site, and a new clubhouse was completed there in 1897.\n"}
{"id": "2152410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152410", "title": "Baseball scorekeeping", "text": "Baseball scorekeeping\n\nBaseball scorekeeping is the practice of recording the details of a baseball game as it unfolds. Professional baseball leagues hire official scorers to keep an official record of each game (from which a box score can be generated), but many fans keep score as well for their own enjoyment. Scorekeeping is usually done on a printed scorecard and, while official scorers must adhere precisely to one of the few different scorekeeping notations, most fans exercise some amount of creativity and adopt their own symbols and styles.\n\nSportswriter Henry Chadwick is generally credited as the inventor of baseball scorekeeping. His basic scorecard and notation have evolved significantly since their advent in the 1870s but they remain the basis for most of what has followed.\n\nSome symbols and abbreviations are shared by nearly all scorekeeping systems. For example, the position of each player is indicated by a number:\n\nThe designated hitter (DH), if used, is marked using a zero (0).\n\nScorecards vary in appearance but almost all share some basic features, including areas for:\n\nUsually two scorecards (one for each team) are used to score a game.\n\nThere is no authoritative set of rules for scorekeeping. The traditional method has many variations in its symbols and syntax, but this is a typical example.\n\nIn the traditional method, each cell in the main area of the scoresheet represents the \"lifetime\" of an offensive player, from at-bat, to baserunner, to being put out, scoring a run, or being left on base.\n\nWhen an out is recorded, the combination of defensive players executing that out is recorded. For example:\n\n\nIf a batter reaches first base, either due to a walk, a hit, or an error, the basepath from home to first base is drawn, and the method described in the lower-righthand corner. For example:\n\nWhen a runner advances due to a following batter, it can be noted by the batting position or the uniform number of the batter that advanced the runner. This kind of information is not always included by amateur scorers, and there is a lot of variation in notation. For example:\n\n\nThe scorecard on the right describes the August 8, 2000 game between the Milwaukee Brewers and San Francisco Giants, played at Pacific Bell Park, in San Francisco. The scorecard describes the following events in the top of the 1st inning:\n\nOne hard and fast rule of baseball scorekeeping is that \"every\" out and \"every\" time a baserunner advances \"must\" be recorded. The scoring can get a little more complicated when a batter who has reached base, is then \"moved up\" (advances one or more bases) by his own actions or by the actions of a hitter behind him. This is demonstrated in the Giants' first inning:\n\n\nStranded baserunners might be notated as being \"LOB\" (Left On Base) for that inning, with a number from 1-3 likely at the bottom of the inning column. For example, if two runners are left on base after the 3rd out, the scorekeeper might note \"LOB:2\", then at the end of the game calculate a total number of LOB for the game.\n\nA more complicated example of scorekeeping is the record of the bottom of the 5th inning:\n\nProject Scoresheet was an organization run by volunteers in the 1980s for the purpose of collecting baseball game data and making it freely available to the public (the data collected by Major League Baseball was and still is not freely available). To collect and distribute the data, Project Scoresheet needed a method of keeping score that could be easily input to a computer. This limited the language to letters, numbers, and punctuation (no baseball diamonds or other symbols not found on a computer keyboard).\n\nIn addition to the new language introduced by Project Scoresheet, a few major changes were made to the traditional scorecard. First, innings of play are not recorded in a one-per-column fashion; instead all boxes are used sequentially and new innings are indicated with a heavy horizontal line. This saves considerable space on the card (since no boxes are left blank) and reduces the likelihood of a game requiring a second set of scorecards.\n\nThe second major change is the detailed offensive and defensive in/out system, which allows the scorekeeper to specify very specifically when players enter and leave the game. This is vital for attributing events to the proper players.\n\nLastly, each \"event box\" on a Project Scoresheet scorecard is broken down into three sections: before the play, during the play, and after the play. All events are put into one of these three slots. For example, a stolen base happens \"before the play\" because it occurs before the batter's at-bat is over. A hit is considered \"during the play\" because it ends the batter's plate appearance, and baserunner movement subsequent to the batter's activity is considered \"after the play\".\n\nThe language developed by Project Scoresheet can be used to record trajectories and locations of batted balls and every defensive player who touched the ball, in addition to the basic information recorded by the traditional method. Here are some examples:\n\nIn the \"before the play\" slot:\n\nIn \"during the play\" slot:\n\nIn the \"after the play\" slot:\n\nFor a complete description of the language and the scorecard please see David Cortesi's documentation.\n\nProject Scoresheet addressed a lack of precision in the traditional scorekeeping method, and introduced several new features to the scorecard. But while the Project Scoresheet language continues to be the baseball research community's standard for storing play-by-play game data in computers, the scorecards it yields are difficult to read due to the backtracking required to reconstruct a mid-inning play. Hence, despite its historical importance, the system has never gained favor with casual fans.\n\nIn 2002 Alex Reisner developed a new scorekeeping method that took the language of Project Scoresheet but redefined the way the event boxes on the scorecard worked, virtually eliminating the backtracking required by both Project Scoresheet and the traditional method. The system also makes it easy to reconstruct any mid-inning situation, a difficult task with the other two systems (for this reason it was originally promoted as \"Situational Scorekeeping\").\n\nA Reisner scorecard looks like a cross between a traditional and Project Scoresheet scorecard. It has a diamond (representing the field, as in the traditional system) and a single line for recording action during and after the play (like Project Scoresheet's second and third lines). The diamond in each event box is used to show which bases are occupied by which players at the start of an at-bat. Stolen bases, pickoffs, and other \"before the play\" events are also marked on the diamond, so that one can see the \"situation\" in which an at-bat took place by simply glancing at the scorecard.\n"}
{"id": "2152425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152425", "title": "Naval Station Argentia", "text": "Naval Station Argentia\n\nNaval Station Argentia is a former base of the United States Navy that operated from 1941 to 1994. It was established in the community of Argentia in what was then the Dominion of Newfoundland, which later became the tenth Canadian province, Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nEstablished under the British-US destroyers for bases agreement of 1940, the base was first occupied on 25 January 1941 following the expropriation of the flat headland formed by a small natural bay called Little Placentia Sound and the western end facing Placentia Bay by the Newfoundland government; over 400 families were displaced.\n\nCivilian construction crews from civilian contractors George A. Fuller Company and Merritt-Chapman and Scott Corporation, rushed to build the base as well as an adjoining air field. On 15 July 1941, the Naval Operating Base was commissioned. On 12 October 1942 the 17th Naval Construction Battalion began to arrive at the base and worked jointly with the civilians until 5 May 1943. At that time it became a completely military operation. Before that happened the 64th CB started to arrive in March followed by the 69th CB in June. On November 17, 1943, Construction Battalion Maintenance Units (CBMUs) 525 and 526 arrived to take over the station maintenance with the CB's having completed the base's construction.\n\nOn 7 August 1941 the heavy cruiser USS \"Augusta\" carrying U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt arrived in the anchorage at Little Placentia Bay off the base. Roosevelt inspected the base construction progress and did some fishing from \"Augusta\" over the next two days. \"Augusta\" was joined by the British warship HMS \"Prince of Wales\" carrying British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on 9 August 1941. While in the Argentia anchorage from 9–12 August, the chiefs of staff of Britain and the U.S. met to discuss war strategies and logistics once the U.S. joined in the war. The two leaders and their aides also negotiated the wording of a press release that they called a \"joint statement\". That press release was issued on 14 August 1941 in Washington, D.C. and was issued simultaneously in London, England. Several days later the \"Daily Herald\" would characterize the public statement as being the Atlantic Charter. However, there never was a signed, legal document called the \"Atlantic Charter\". Neither Roosevelt nor Churchill signed it. The conference concluded the evening of 12 August 1941 with the British and American warships and their escorts passing in review before departing the area for their home ports. The joint declaration was publicly announced on 14 August, presumably after \"Prince of Wales\" had returned to UK waters.\n\nOn 28 August 1941 Naval Air Station Argentia was commissioned. NAS Argentia was built on the plateau atop the triangular peninsula adjacent to Naval Station Argentia's anchorage and shore facilities. The air station was used to base convoy protection, coastal patrol and anti-submarine aircraft, both land-based aircraft and seaplanes. While NAS Argentia was nominally an independent facility from Naval Station Argentia, both facilities are largely viewed as one.\n\nBeginning that summer, was used to house Flag Headquarters at the base.\nFebruary 1942 saw the Argentia base at the centre of one of the worst accidental disasters in the US Navy's history when and grounded and were lost with heavy casualties southwest of the base. Over 100 victims were buried in Argentia's military cemetery.\n\nUnited States Army Coast Artillery Corps troops were first deployed to Argentia in early 1941, at first a single coast defence battery with two or four 155 mm guns and an anti-aircraft battery. In January 1942 construction began on two batteries of 6-inch guns, and in March 1942 the United States Army established Fort McAndrew at Argentia to provide security to the navy base through an anti-aircraft battery and additional coast defence guns. Later that spring the Royal Navy established a small maintenance base at Argentia to service its ships involved in convoy escort groups operating out of Halifax, Sydney, St. John's and in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nA US Navy-manned indicator loop station (Station 1X) was at Argentia; this detected submarines via their magnetic signature.\n\nIn the spring of 1943 a 7,000 ton floating drydock was installed at Argentia, along with a ship repair facility. In August 1943, Task Force 24 Flag Headquarters moved ashore to permanent facilities after having been housed aboard USS \"Prairie\".\n\nIn 1944, Argentia served as one of the two stopover bases for the refuelling, maintenance, and crew changes of the six United States Navy (USN) K-class blimps that made the first transatlantic crossings of non-rigid airships. Blimps K-123 and K-130 from USN Blimp Squadron 14 (also known as ZP-14, Blimpron 14, or \"The Africa Squadron\") left South Weymouth Naval Air Station in Massachusetts on 28 May 1944 and landed at Argentia about 16 hours later. The two K-ships then flew for approximately 22 hours to Lages Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, the second stopover base for the transatlantic flights. The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco). Blimps K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 then K-112 and K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June, respectively, in 1944. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and PB4Y-2) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945. In late April 1945, K-89 and K-114 left NAS Weeksville (now Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City) in North Carolina and flew a southern route to NAS Bermuda, the Azores, and Port Lyautey, where they arrived on 1 May 1945.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as USAAF Aerodrome - Argentia, Newfoundland at with a variation of 29 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as \"All hard surfaced\" and had three runways listed as follows:\n\nUnited States Army Coast Artillery Corps troops were first deployed to Argentia in January 1941, initially Battery A of the 57th Coast Artillery (Tractor Drawn) (TD) Regiment with two or possibly four mobile 155 mm guns, and Battery B of the 62nd Coast Artillery (Anti-aircraft) (AA) Regiment. A command known as the Harbor Defenses of Argentia and St. John's was established at this time to coordinate US coast defence activities in Newfoundland, under the Newfoundland Base Command. On 20 July 1941 the 155 mm gun battery was redesignated as Battery A, 53rd Coast Artillery (TD) Regiment, and on 1 August 1941 (some sources 1942) the AA battery was redesignated as Battery A, 421st CA (AA) Battalion (Separate). After the US entered the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, construction on two batteries (Batteries 281 and 282) of two 6-inch guns each began in January 1942 and was completed in October 1942. These guns were on shielded long-range carriages with reinforced concrete and earth bunkers housing magazines and fire control equipment. On 16 February 1942 the harbour defence units in Newfoundland were redesignated as components of the 24th Coast Artillery (Harbor Defense) (Composite) Regiment, the headquarters and two additional batteries of which arrived at Fort McAndrew from the US on 25 March 1942. In April 1942 the AA defences were strengthened with the arrival of the 422nd CA Battalion (AA).\n\nBy the end of 1942 the coast defence gun batteries in the Argentia area were as follows:\n\nIn March 1943 the 24th CA Regiment was reduced to a battalion. In December 1943-January 1944 elements of the unit returned to the US for inactivation. In October 1944 the unit was reorganized, but was not fully inactivated until 8 September 1945. The date the unit was transferred to the US for inactivation is unclear. Postwar, circa 1946 the coast defence batteries were inactivated. The 6-inch guns of Batteries 281 and 282 survive. Battery 282's guns are still in place, and in 1993 Battery 281's guns were moved to Fort Columbia in Washington state, US.\n\nFollowing the war's end in August 1945, the first dependents of naval personnel were permitted to move to Argentia to live in permanent quarters on base.\n\nIn 1946, Fort McAndrew was transferred to the U.S. Army Air Forces which became the United States Air Force in 1947. In 1948, Fort McAndrew was renamed McAndrew Air Force Base.\n\nIn 1949, Newfoundland joined the Canadian Confederation as the 10th province. During the Cold War, Argentia Naval Station became a key \"node\" in the Northwest Atlantic's SOSUS network, helping to detect Soviet nuclear submarines. The base was the target of several espionage attempts between the 1940s–1990s as a result.\n\nIn 1955 McAndrew AFB was decommissioned and the facility was turned over to the US Navy with USAF personnel moving to other locations in Newfoundland such as Ernest Harmon AFB, Goose AFB or various radar installations being built in conjunction with the Royal Canadian Air Force such as the Pinetree Line, Mid-Canada Line and Distant Early Warning Line. Associated with the DEW Line, radar picket ships such as USS \"Hissem\" used the base, and Lockheed WV-2 Warning Star aircraft used the airfield. These ships and aircraft were called Barrier Force Atlantic (BARLANT) and operated from 1955 through 1965.\n\nIn 1959 the Navy deployed a portable Transit tracking station at the station, which recorded the doppler data from the 24-minute flight of the Transit 1A satellite launched on 17 September 1959. An ionospheric refraction value was calculated using the doppler data recovered by the portable station, and a correction factor was then applied to the data to produce a doppler curve unaffected by ionospheric refraction. The Satellite 1-A trajectory thus determined was in close agreement with range track data. \n\nIn 1959 the United States Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Argentia was established as a Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) shore terminal. The next year NAVFAC Argentia was terminus for an atypical SOSUS shallow water system designated King Shallow Water composed of ten eight-element arrays, vice the usual forty element deep water arrays. The shallow water system was intended to monitor Soviet patrols into Hudson Bay. In 1963 the first 2x20 array was installed terminating at NAVFAC Argentia. The shallow water system was deactivated in 1968.\n\nIn 1972 NAVFAC became a joint operations station for the US Navy and the Canadian Forces but Naval Air Station Argentia was decommissioned and the land transferred in 1975 to the Government of Canada. It was subsequently transferred to the provincial government for development. On 30 September 1994 the US Navy left Argentia completely when NAVFAC Argentia was decommissioned (Canadian operations were transferred to Canadian Forces IUSS Centre in Halifax) and the last personnel moved out.\n\nUntil 1994, the runways of the former airfield were utilized by the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. The Air Cadets operated weekend glider familiarization through the Air Cadet Gliding Program. The Schweizer SGS 2-33 was launched using an auto-tow launch method, utilizing the entire length of the runway surfaces. Personnel were housed at the Naval Station Argentia facilities. After the US Naval Station was decommissioned, the glider program was operated without facilities support for a few years until the airfield was occupied for the Hydromet Test Facility owned by INCO. With the announcement that the INCO development would not be using the airfield, the Air Cadet Gliding Program once again started using the airfield for gliding operations in May 2008.\n\n\n"}

Fuel carbon “char” particles (heavier, less volatile coal constituents) require much higher temperatures and a continuing supply of oxygen. Cyclone furnaces are able to provide a thorough mixing of coal particles and air with sufficient turbulence to provide fresh air to surfaces of the coal particles.\n\nCyclone furnaces were originally designed to take advantage of four things\n\nA cyclone furnace consists of a horizontal cylindrical barrel attached through the side of a boiler furnace. The cyclone barrel is constructed with water cooled, tangential oriented, tube construction. Inside the cyclone barrel are short, densely spaced, pin studs welded to the outside of the tubes. The studs are coated with a refractory material, usually silica or aluminium based, that allows the cyclone to operate at a high enough temperature to keep the slag in a molten state and allow removal through the tap.\n\nCrushed coal and a small amount of primary air enter from the front of the cyclone into the burner. In the main cyclone burner, secondary air is introduced tangentially, causing a circulating gas flow pattern. The products, flue gas and un-combusted fuel, then leave the burner and pass over the boiler tubes. Tertiary air is then released further downstream to complete combustion of the remaining fuel, greatly reducing NOx formation. A layer of molten slag coats the burner and flows through traps at the bottom of the burners, reducing the amount of slag that would otherwise form on the boiler tubes.\n\nCyclone Furnaces can handle a wide range of fuels. Low volatile bituminous coals, lignite coal, mineral rich anthracitic coal, wood chips, petroleum coke, and old tires can and have all been used in cyclones.\n\nThe crushed coal is fed into the cyclone burner and fired with high rates of heat release. Before the hot gases enter in the boiler furnace the combustion of coal is completed. The crushed coal is fed into cyclone burners .The coal is Burned by centrifugal action which is imparted by the primary air which enters tangentially and secondary Air which also enters in the top tangentially at high speed and tertiary air is admitted in the centre.\nDue to Whirling action of coal and air, a large amount of heat is generated (1500-1600°c)and that covered the surface of cyclone and ashes are transformed into molten slag .The molten slag drained from the boiler furnace through a slag tap.\n"}

Snyder and Elizabeth Hire (Heiher). He went to public schools and then to Bethany and Schylo Academy and Yadkin College, all in North Carolina.\n\nSnyder arrived in California in 1880 at age 22, and he was married to May Ross of Washington, D.C., on February 14, 1888, in San Diego, California. They had one child, Ross Snyder, who was killed in World War I at the Battle of Chateau-Thierry in France. In 1923, Ross Snyder’s body was returned to Los Angeles, and lay in state for a day in Pershing Square before burial at Hollywood Cemetery.\n\nSnyder was a Mason and an Elk and a member of the Jonathan Club, the Los Angeles Country Club, the Lomita Gun Club, the Knights of Pythias and the Knights Templar. He was a Protestant and a Democrat. His nickname was Pinky, \"because of the color of his flaming red \"side-burns.\"\n\nHe died at the Jonathan Club on April 7, 1937, at the age of 78, and his body lay in state in the City Hall, with interment at Hollywood Cemetery.\n\nIn 1990, the city of Hermosa Beach, California, included Pinxton's \"extensively remodeled home\" at No. 2020 The Strand on a map guide to home of notable people in that city.\n\nSnyder established the M.P. Snyder Shoe Company in 1892, and in 1904 he organized the California Savings Bank, and he served as its president for 14 years. At various times he was president of the Home Telephone Company in San Diego, owner of the Meredith office building, organizer and president of California Guaranty Corporation and an officer or director in the Gardena Bank and Trust Company, the American Druggist Syndicate and the Lomita Land and Water Company. He owned property in the San Joaquin Valley, which at first was farmed and later subdivided. This was the \"old Dallas ranch, not far from the quaint little town of Hickman and the Dunkard settlement of Waterford.\" In 1905 he invested in a rubbish-disposal company.\n\nSnyder was a candidate for mayor on a \"reform\" ticket in 1896, he was a police commissioner in 1901–04, a member of the City Council in 1904–07, mayor of Los Angeles in 1897–99, and he was reelected in 1902 for another term and then again in 1919, serving until June 1921. He ran again that year but lost to George E. Cryer. He was a Los Angeles City public service commissioner beginning in 1913 and serving until 1917 or 1918. His last appointment was Governor James Rolph's naming him to the State Industrial Accident Commission, from 1931 to 1935.\n\nHe was active in the successful movement to open Los Angeles Harbor and to connect it by a shoestring strip between Los Angeles and San Pedro and Wilmington. During his mayoralty, the Third Street Tunnel was bored through Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, in 1901, and the water system became municipally owned. He appointed the city's first Water Commission, which made plans to bring water to the city from the Owens Valley. Of him, historians Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt said:\n\nA Democrat in a period of Republican ascendancy, he was elected the first time because he favored municipal ownership of the waterworks. . . . In 1904 he opposed a corrupt printing contract between the city and the Republican \"Los Angeles Times.\" . . .

{"id": "2152428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152428", "title": "California State Route 33", "text": "California State Route 33\n\nState Route 33 (SR 33) is a north–south state highway in the U.S. state of California. It runs north from U.S. Route 101 in Ventura through the Transverse Ranges and the western side of the San Joaquin Valley to Interstate 5 at a point east of Tracy. SR 33 replaced part of U.S. Route 399 in 1964 during the \"great renumbering\" of routes. In the unincorporated sections of Kern County it is known as the West Side Highway. In addition, the California Legislature designated the entire Kern County portion as the Petroleum Highway in 2004. The southernmost portion in Ventura is a freeway known as the Ojai Freeway, while it is known as the Maricopa Highway from Ojai to Maricopa.\n\nCalifornia State Route 33 begins in Ventura as a short freeway (\"Ojai Freeway\"). SR 33 then continues north as Maricopa Highway, an undivided surface road, through Ojai, following Matilija Canyon past the easternmost extremity of the Santa Ynez Mountains in Los Padres National Forest, and passing over the Transverse Ranges at Pine Mountain Summit. As SR 33 comes down into the Cuyama Valley, it comes up to a junction with SR 166 east of Cuyama. Route 33 continues with Route 166 as they enter Kern County for about to Maricopa where the routes separate. In Maricopa, Route 33 turns northwest, following the western side of the San Joaquin Valley. Between Taft and Avenal it roughly parallels Interstate 5; for the first of the portion following the axis of the Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Northwest of Avenal, it turns due west to enter Coalinga, then turns northeast and soon becomes concurrent with I-5 for . Thereafter, it departs due north near Cantua Creek, turns northwest at Mendota, through Firebaugh and meets State Route 152 in Dos Palos, in which it runs concurrently due west for approximately ten miles. It departs again west of Los Banos, turning north to Santa Nella (where it has an interchange with I-5), and roughly parallels I-5 and the San Joaquin River until its northern terminus at I-5 and Bird Road southeast of Tracy.\nWhen passing through the Avenal/Coalinga area travelers pass near a series of prisons and government facilities. They include: Avenal State Prison, Pleasant Valley State Prison, and the new Coalinga Mental Hospital.\nIn the portions of the route in Kern and Fresno Counties, SR 33 passes through one of the United States' largest petroleum extraction fields, with hundreds of nodding oil pumps along the highway. Some of the fields visible from the highway include the Midway-Sunset, South and North Belridge, Cymric, McKittrick, Lost Hills, and Coalinga oil fields.\nMost of SR 33's route passes through sparsely populated, relatively desolate portions of the San Joaquin Valley. Travelers along it should use caution, since emergency services are typically dozens of miles away. Carrying extra water and coolant is especially advised, since summertime temperatures in the area routinely surpass .\n\nSeveral segments of this route are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but only a small portion near SR 152 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Several segments are eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only the portion from 6.4 miles north of the SR 150 junction to the Ventura–Santa Barbara county line is a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. This scenic segment is also designated as part of the Jacinto Reyes Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway.\n\nBefore the US 399 designation was deleted in 1964, SR 33 followed SR 166 east from US 99 at Wheeler Ridge to Maricopa in lieu of the segment from Ventura to Maricopa, and followed the old US highway from Taft to Maricopa. Today, SR 166 remains on the segment between Wheeler Ridge and Maricopa.\n\nSR 33 used to extend north to Interstate 205 in Tracy, but this segment was relinquished after the segment of Interstate 5 from SR 33 to I-205 was completed.\n\n"}

In that case, Black has not won material, but has destroyed White's center. Instead of allowing d5, White hopes to cause trouble for Black by returning the piece while depriving him of the right to castle. However, Black can easily castle artificially, for example:\n\nWhite castles \"naturally\".\n\nBlack begins castling artificially.\n\nBlack has achieved a normal castled position (Rf8, Kg8), but in several moves. The absence of any pawns in the center indicates that king safety is of particular importance in this position. Black's development lags slightly, but he also possesses the bishop pair and a queenside pawn majority, so his position is at least equal.\n\nIn an even more common opening (a main line of the Benko Gambit, \"ECO\" A59), White uses the g2-square in an artificial castle maneuver to safeguard his king after an exchange of bishops on f1 precludes castling normally:\n\nThe following game between Jonathan Mestel and Sergey Makarichev played in Hastings 1979 features yet another way to artificially castle:\nA unique and even humorous artificial castling took place in the game Heidenfeld–Hecht, played in the Nice Chess Olympiad 1974:\n"}

Whitney and Flora (née Payne) Whitney. Her father was corporation counsel for New York City from 1875 to 1882, United States Secretary of the Navy from 1885 to 1889 (under President Grover Cleveland), and a force in street-railway affairs until his retirement in 1902. Pauline Whitney had her social debut in 1892.\n\nShe received a large fortune from her uncle, Colonel Oliver Hazard Payne (1839-1917), one of the founders and original directors of the Standard Oil Company. Shortly before her death she divided $4,000,000 between her two daughters.\n\nOn November 12, 1895, she was married to the British-born Almeric Hugh Paget (1861-1949). He was educated at Harrow, and was the sixth and youngest son of Cecilia (née Wyndham) Paget and Lord Alfred Paget, and a grandson of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, who commanded the British cavalry at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The marriage was solemnized at St. Thomas's Church, New York City, and among those attending it was President Grover Cleveland.\n\nWith Paget she had two daughters, but the marriage was not entirely happy.\n\n\nIn 1893, her husband joined Henry Melville Whitney in establishing the Dominion Coal Company Ltd. and, in 1901, the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Ltd. at Sydney, Nova Scotia. That same year, the Pagets moved to England, ostensibly because of Pauline's ill health. Paget was later elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Unionist party candidate for Cambridge, serving from 1910 to 1917.\n\nDuring the First World War, at the Summerdown convalescent camp in Eastbourne and at other facilities in England, she organized the Almeric Paget Massage Corps to provide physiotherapy to injured soldiers by trained masseuses. During this time, she became known as the \"Angel of Summerdown\". The corps started in late 1914 and continued to operate after her death.\n\nPauline Paget died after a three weeks' illness at Esher, Surrey, on November 22, 1916, at the age of forty-two. She was buried at Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire. After her death, her husband resigned from the House of Commons and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Queenborough. Lord Queensborough later remarried to another American heiress, Edith Starr Miller, with whom he had three additional daughters before their divorce.\n"}

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., KYSR is the flagship station of syndicated morning drive program \"The Woody Show\" and the home of radio personality Andrew Harms. The KYSR studios are located in Burbank, while the station transmitter resides on Star Mountain in Beverly Hills. In addition to a standard analog transmission, KYSR broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. KYSR also extends its signal by using a single full-power repeater: KSRY (103.1 FM) in Tehachapi.. The station's competitor is cross-town rival KROQ (106.7 FM) which is owned by Entercom\n\nThis station was built and signed on as KMGM, owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, on May 27, 1948. KMGM suspended operations in 1953, and the film studio sold KMGM's studio and transmitter to Art and Jean Crawford, who relaunched operations on June 30, 1954 as KCBH. The couple owned \"Crawford's of Beverly Hills Record & Hi-Fi Store\", and used their store's inventory as a record library for the station. \n\nIn October 1970, the station became \"K-Joy\" KJOI, and played beautiful music for nearly two decades. In 1976, KJOI was acquired by Command Communications.\n\nBy 1989, KJOI began playing fewer instrumental cover versions of popular songs and added more vocalists to the playlist, eschewing middle of the road songs in favor of soft adult contemporary. Instrumentals were dropped altogether in November 1989, when the station became known as \"Touch 98.7,\" positioned between Smooth Jazz-formatted KTWV and Soft AC-formatted KOST. On February 12, 1990, the call letters were changed to KXEZ, with the format altered to \"Easy Oldies.\" \n\nOn August 21, 1992, KXEZ became \"Star 98.7\", KYSR. In the beginning, KYSR aired an adult contemporary music format, which by 1993 evolved into hot adult contemporary; also in 1993, Viacom acquired the station for $40 million. MTV VJ Mark Goodman was heard on KYSR from 1996 to 1997; no official reason for his departure was given, but his father died shortly before his departure. Ryan Seacrest co-hosted KYSR's afternoon drive program with Lisa Foxx from 1995 to 2003; both hosts were among the top rated afternoon drive shows in Los Angeles for 7 years.\n\nBy mid-1995, KYSR adjusted its format by dropping most of the rhythmic and soft rock tunes, shifting to a pop-leaning modern rock direction, minus the harder approach embraced by the more mainstream alternative KROQ. This version of Hot AC was called \"modern adult contemporary\", and became one of the first stations in the U.S. with the format. Viacom sold the station to Chancellor Media in 1997. The company was renamed AMFM Inc., after Chancellor Media merged with Capstar in 1999. In 2000, AMFM Inc. merged with its current owner, Clear Channel Communications, now known as iHeartMedia. Coincidentally, around this time Viacom became the owners of KROQ-FM when that station's parent company, CBS, merged with Viacom.\n\n\"Jamie, Frosty & Frank\" were hired as hosts for KYSR's morning drive program in 1998; Frosty Stilwell and Frank Kramer were fired on September 15, 1999, and Jamie White was paired with Danny Bonaduce. Bonaduce departed on July 1, 2005; his vacancy was filled by board-op Jack Heine and producer Mike \"Stench\" Roberts.\n\nStarting in 2002, KYSR began to experience a drop in its ratings due to a combination of factors, including the decline of hit music product in the modern adult contemporary genre, compounded later on by KCBS-FM's switch to an adult hits format. In September 2005, KYSR adjusted its playlist to focus on 1980s and 1990s hot adult contemporary music, supervised by sister station KHHT program director Mike Marino. \n\nBy April 2006, KYSR moved back to a modern adult contemporary music format with the tag line of \"Today's Music Alternative.\" In addition, all on air personalities, including the morning show \"Jamie, Jack, and Stench\", were temporarily pulled off the station; fans of the morning show were upset by this move, which included a public protest outside the station. Shortly afterwards, a poll was offered on the KYSR website asking if the listeners wanted \"Jamie, Jack and Stench\" to return. Ninety-seven percent said yes, and a week later, they returned to the air. However, \"Jamie, Jack and Stench\" were replaced a year later by the morning team of Sean Valentine and Lisa Foxx in 2007.\n\nOn September 20, 2007, KYSR re-positioned itself as \"98-7,\" officially dropping the \"Star\" branding after 15 years. The station moved to a standard Alternative format, aimed more at young men, rather than Modern AC, aimed more at young women. While KYSR still reported to broadcasting trade publications as Modern AC, its musical lean favored Modern Rock/Alternative hits with an updated library of alternative titles from the 1980s, 90s and early 2000s, including Nirvana, Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Third Eye Blind and R.E.M.. In addition, KYSR played more new modern rock hits from bands such as The Killers, Foo Fighters, Incubus and Linkin Park. This repositioning came three days after sister station KBIG dropped many dance and disco hits, and rebranded as \"104.3 MYfm.\" Effective September 24, 2007, Sean Valentine moved over to the KBIG morning show, replacing Charlie Tuna, whose last show was September 17th.\n\nKYSR changed positioning from Modern AC to Alternative in 2008 to compete with KROQ; while the core artists largely remained the same and leaned more in a pop direction than most alternative rock stations, the station's imaging was changed, along with a new logo holding the numbers 98 and 7 in Gothic typeface with a metallic star between the numerals. Both R&R/Nielsen BDS and Mediabase concurrently added KYSR as an alternative/modern rock reporter. On August 9, 2013, the station rebranded as \"ALT 98.7,\" with no other change to the format.\n\n\"The Woody Show\" began airing in mornings on April 21, 2014, reuniting \"Woody\" Fife, Renae Ravey, Greg Gory and Jason \"Menace\" McMurry, who had all last worked together at KITS, an alternative rock station in San Francisco. The show proved so popular that the show began national syndication through Premiere Networks. \n\n\"Damn Julianne\" Miller was both a phone screener for \"The Woody Show\" and a weekend host on KYSR; she was one of several hundred employees fired by iHeart—along with evening host Jake Dill—on January 20, 2020. \n\nOn March 9, 2020, iHeart announced that KYSR will be affiliated with the National Football League beginning in August 2020. The station will air all Los Angeles Chargers games as part of the deal. KYSR will also run contests and sweepstakes, including game tickets and official merchandise. The partnership will expand to events organized by sister station KIIS FM beginning with its 2020 Jingle Ball.\n\nWeekday programming includes \"The Woody Show\" in mornings via Premiere Networks; Hudson middays and Harms afternoons. Weekend hosts feature Hudson, Tobi Lynn and Jason \"Menace\" McMurry.\n\nKYSR-HD2 formerly broadcast an adult alternative format called \"eRockster,\" a national online music and social networking portal, syndicated FM radio show and HD side channel radio station that offered listeners the opportunity to participate in building and programming the radio station; KYSR-HD2 currently simulcasts sports radio KLAC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152455", "title": "2005 ICC Trophy", "text": "2005 ICC Trophy\n\nThe 2005 ICC Trophy was a cricket tournament held in Ireland between 1 July and 13 July. It was an international one-day tournament played over 50 overs per side between 12 Associate Members of the International Cricket Council. It came with the prize of a place in the 2007 Cricket World Cup (and together with it a share of US$2.5 million for future development) for the five top-ranked teams, and with the prize of official One-Day International status from 1 January 2006 (until the 2009 ICC Trophy) for the five top-ranked teams along with Kenya, who had already been given official one-day status until the 2009 ICC Trophy and a spot in the 2007 World Cup.\n\nFor the first time five spots were on offer for the World Cup, previously three. On 7 July, the top 4 teams Scotland, Canada and for the first time Ireland and Bermuda qualified for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and, from 1 January 2006, gained official One-Day International status. On 11 July the Netherlands also achieved this by beating the United Arab Emirates to finish fifth. Scotland won the tournament, beating Ireland by 47 runs in the final.\n\nDutch batsman Bas Zuiderent was named as Player of the Tournament.\n\nThe 12 teams were divided into two groups of six teams. Each team played with each other in its group once. Five matches per team were played between 1 July and 7 July. The resulting group tables were then each divided into three bands of two teams each.\n\nCombining the two groups, the four teams in each band then played a mini knock-out tournament consisting of two semi-finals, a championship, and a consolation match, so that the first- and second-ranked teams from each of the original groups were playing for first through fourth place in the tournament overall; the third- and fourth-ranked teams for fifth through eighth; and the fifth- and sixth-ranked teams for ninth through twelfth. Thus at the end of the tournament all teams are given a definitive rank between 1 and 12. The final play-offs were played on 11 July with the final on 13 July.\n\nApart from the academic interest in this final classification, one match in particular had great significance: the winner of the second band's mini tournament would, by taking fifth place overall, become the fifth and final team to win temporary ODI status and an invitation to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\n\nThere were 12 teams that played in the tournament. The teams that played were:\n\nIreland (315 for 8) beat Bermuda (218 for 6) easily as Ed Joyce made 103 for the hosts in Stormont.\n\nDenmark beat Uganda by 28 runs as Thomas Munkholt Hansen took 6 for 30 to carry Denmark to a 28-run win over Uganda in Muckamore. Denmark made 196 with Johan Malcolm making 71. Despite 59 from Kenneth Kamyuka, the Africans could only manage 168 in reply.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (200) beat the United States (145), who remain in disarray after their recent political troubles.\n\nThe upset of the day was a 30 run win by Bermuda (217) over the United Arab Emirates (187).\n\nThe United States went down to a heavy 96 run defeat by Denmark, for whom wicket-keeper Frederik Klokker starred with 138 not out and a smart stumping.\n\nAn all-round performance by the Irish batsmen saw them through to 231 for 8 against Uganda. In reply, however, only Frank Nsubuga, with 59, put up any resistance as the hosts ended up winners by 127 runs.\n\nBermuda (249) steered towards the second spot in the group and the World Cup with a thumping 93-run win over Denmark, who lacked application in their batting as they were all out for 156.\n\nIreland were troubled by the United Arab Emirates in a match that could decide Ireland's qualification for the Cricket World Cup. The UAE batted first, making 230 in 48.3 overs before being bowled out, and a fiery opening spell from Ali Asad then reduced the Irish to 23 for 4. Ed Joyce and Trent Johnston rebuilt with a partnership of 122, and Joyce batted well with the tail to make 115 not out in Ireland's 231 for 8.\n\nUganda (237 for 4) recorded their first win, beating the USA by six wickets (236), Joel Olwenyi top-scoring with 76 after all-rounder Frank Nsubuga had taken 3 for 33\n\nAll of the Group A games were washed out or abandoned because of weather conditions. Under the playing conditions, the rest day was only to be used as a reserve day if all matches in both groups were washed out. Therefore, the games between Ireland and the United States, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates (after the UAE had reached 57 for 3 after 15 overs), and Uganda and Bermuda were all \"no results\". The wash-out eliminates the United States from World Cup and ODI status contention.\n\nBermuda, who were ranked as the third-best team from the Americas coming into the tournament easily overcame the United States. 132 from only 88 balls from JJ Tucker and 52 extras saw the Bermudians through to 311 for 8. The Americans started by keeping up with the run rate, but wickets fell and they finished all out for 198.\n\nIreland (222 all out) beat Denmark (149 all out) to take the remaining automatic qualifying spot for the World Cup and ODI status.\n\nThe UAE (201 all out) secured a 63 run victory over Uganda (138 all out) to make sure they would be in the 5th place semi-final along with the Danes.\n\nThe closest game of the first round was between Canada and Namibia. John Davison, who at the time held the record for the fastest century in the Cricket World Cup made 125, supported by Ian Billcliff's 90 as the North Americans put on 284. In reply, Namibia came close, making 282 to lose by 2 runs in Group B's first heavyweight clash, thanks to Canada's captain, Kevin Sandher's five wickets. Namibia put in a protest, however, claiming that the scoring in the 45th over was wrong. The technical committee turned down Namibia's protest, which prompted Namibia to put in an appeal. Namibia's appeal against the technical committee's ruling was turned down, meaning that Canada retain the 2 points they won on 1 July.\n\nThe Netherlands (71 for 1) were easy winners over Papua New Guinea (69 all out) by 9 wickets.\n\nOman (83) were easily beaten by Scotland (84 for 4) by 6 wickets with 31 overs to spare.\n\nThe biggest game of the round saw Scotland (190 for 3), courtesy of Fraser Watts (81*) and Gavin Hamilton (86*) end up winners by 7 wickets over Canada (189).\n\nNamibia (252) got off the board with a comfortable victory over Papua New Guinea (156).\n\nBas Zuiderent made 119 and Daan van Bunge 92 as Netherlands piled on the runs, whereas only one Omani scored in doubled figures as Oman (67) were completely thrashed by Netherlands (325 for 5) by 258 runs.\n\nCanada got into trouble against Oman – after having bowled them out for 184, wickets fell around John Davison – who made 74 – and Ian Billcliff, but eventually the Canadians snared a two-wicket win.\n\nThe Netherlands secured a win over Namibia, but the match was eventually much closer than it could have been. After Edgar Schiferli took four wickets for 50, helping with bowling Namibia out for 188, Bas Zuiderent and Tom de Grooth opened up a partnership of 135. Four quick wickets sent the Dutch struggling to 155 for 4, but Zuiderent and Ryan ten Doeschate saw them home.\n\nMeanwhile, Papua New Guinea were bowled out for 90 by Scotland, John Blain and Dougie Brown taking four wickets each, but Toka Gaudi gave the Scots a scare with his three wickets. However, the Scots managed a five-wicket win.\n\nScotland (236 for 7) maintained their 100% record with a 27 run win against Namibia (209 all out) in a game reduced to 33 overs in which Ryan Watson starred with 87.\n\nThe Netherlands (187 for 9) batted first against Canada in a game reduced to 35 overs a side. A further 19 minute break for bad light meant the Canadians target was reduced to 160 in 30 overs. Despite 5 for 30 from Billy Stelling, Canada reached their target with one ball and 2 wickets to spare in an innings anchored by Desmond Chumney with 64.\n\nRain reduced Papua New Guinea's match against Oman to a 24 over-a-side affair. The Papuans reached 134 for 7 in their overs, before skittling the Omanis for 41 all out.\n\nWith Canada (319 for 4) winning heavily against Papua New Guinea (159 all out), thanks to Billcliff's 102* and Davison's 62, the Canadians made sure they qualified for the World Cup and ODI status on run-rate.\n\nNamibia (173/4) easily overhauled Oman's score of 170 with almost nine overs to spare.\n\nScotland (221 all out) maintained their 100% record against the Netherlands (123 all out), which saw Scotland through to the semi-finals. The Netherlands, along with Namibia (173 for 4), who beat Oman (170 for 9) by 6 wickets, qualify for the 5th place semi-finals.\n\nThe final group tables are as follows:\n\nIreland defeated Canada in the first semi-final. Winning the toss and bowling, the Irish – weakened by Ed Joyce's return to Middlesex – struggled initially, John Davison hitting eight fours and a run single in his 15-ball 33. However, five Canadian batsmen were out with scores in the thirties, as Canada eventually crept to 238 for 9 – Andre Botha taking four for 47. Ireland's reply started cautiously, yet Sanjayan Thuraisingam and Kevin Sandher shared wickets, and after fifteen overs Ireland were only 60 for 3. With ten overs to go, and Trent Johnston having been caught by Sunil Dhaniram, Ireland needed 68 runs to win. However, Peter Gillespie and Northamptonshire player Andrew White hit out well, Gillespie scoring a career-best score in the ICC Trophy with 64 – and Ireland squeezed home with four balls and four wickets to spare.\n\nScotland didn't have as tough a time of it against Bermuda, but still had to ponder innumerable wides. In all, Scotland conceded 49 extras in 50 overs, of which 30 were wides – only Bermudian wicket-keeper Dean Minors out-scoring the extras. Bermuda reached a total of 219 for 9, having been 88 for 7, and a fiery opening burst from 42-year-old Dennis Archer had the Scots worried. However, Cedric English and Gavin Hamilton steadied the ship, and the Scots eventually won by six wickets, making 222 for 4 in 46.5 overs.\n\nDenmark were batted out of the game by Bas Zuiderent and Daan van Bunge who both made centuries as the Danish spin bowling was taken to all corners. Van Bunge made 137 and Zuiderent 107 as the Dutch amassed 314 for 6, also helped by Ryan ten Doeschate who made 32. Despite Thomas Hansen bowling a maiden and taking three for 41, it was not enough. In reply, the Danes were in with a shout as long as Frederik Klokker was at the crease, but when he was gone for 52, it was quickly over. The Danes crawled to 225 all out, not a bad score by their standards, but still defeated by 89 runs.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, pulled off a somewhat surprising victory over Namibia, who had qualified for the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Despite all-rounder Gerrie Snyman scoring 83 not out in Namibia's total of 240 for 7, and his early efforts to have UAE on 18 for 2, UAE responded with an experienced all-rounder of their own, Khurram Khan. The captain made 92 as UAE won by six wickets with three overs to spare.\n\nOman reached the ninth place play-off with a surprise win over Uganda. Oman were initially reduced to 97 for 7, but recovered, Mohammad Aslam scoring 39 as they finished all out for 181. In reply, Kenneth Kamyuka and Lawrence Sematimba paired up for 106 after a shaky start to 37 for 5, but when Sematimba departed for 48 the wheels fell off the Ugandan chase, and they ended all out on 175, losing by six runs.\n\nThe United States had relatively few problems in beating Papua New Guinea. First, Imran Awan took four for 46 (including six wides and four no-balls) to help bowl out the Papuans for 171. Then, Steve Massiah and Gowkaran Roopnarine helped themselves to unbeaten fifties, as USA won by eight wickets with 18 overs remaining in the game.\n\nCanada disposed of Bermuda relatively easily, Sanjayan Thuraisingam taking three for 16 in nearly ten overs as Bermuda rolled over for 195, and despite John Davison being out for 5, Canada controlled their way to the target, Zubin Surkari top-scoring with 47 as Canada won by five wickets.\n\nThe Dutch cricket team won this most important of the placement matches on 11 July, as the winner would qualify for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and also for ODI status and several grants from the ICC. Batting first, the Dutch were led to another big score after Bas Zuiderent made another century – this time unbeaten, for 116. Ryan ten Doeschate added 65 not out, while Tim de Leede also made 65, and the Dutch scored 287 for 4. In reply, the UAE always knew they were up against a massive total, and lost wickets exceedingly quickly – their highest partnership was 41, as they made 142 all out, losing by 143 runs.\n\nThe air had gone out of the Danish balloon, as they rolled over to Sarel Burger – one of Namibia's four players named Burger. Having elected to bat, Namibia made 230 for 9, while Danish spinner Bobby Chawla took three for 42. After an opening partnership of 49 between Baljit Singh and Frederik Klokker, Sarel Burger took five wickets for 23 runs, as the Danes crumbled to 127 all out.\n\nIn an unusually high-scoring match, the United States lost despite scoring 345 for 6 in their innings. Roopnarine continued on his semi-final form, making 98, while six sixes from Tony Reid sent his score to 61 not out off 29 balls. The USA looked on course to winning when Oman had been reduced to 211 for 7 – however, Farhan Khan wanted otherwise, smashing nine sixes on his way to 94 not out, and Oman took a three-wicket win.\n\nPapua New Guinea, who had qualified for this tournament through the extra chance in the World Cup Qualifying Series, got their first win in an extremely close-run match with Uganda. After young pace bowler Emmanuel Isaneez had taken four for 48 to reduce Papua New Guinea to 203 all out, Papuan Hitolo Areni responded with four quick wickets, as Uganda crumbled to 16 for 4 – and then 153 for 9. Kenneth Kamyuka then showed the Papuans how to stay on strike, as his batting partner Isaneez faced three deliveries in their partnership of 49. However, Kamyuka just could not hit the runs quickly enough, and Uganda ended on 202 for 9 – thus claiming the wooden spoon.\n\nThis match was played two days after the other five placement matches. Scotland batted Ireland out of the match, their returning county professionals taking full advantage. Ryan Watson top-scored for the Scots with 94, but Dougie Brown (59 off 44 balls) and Fraser Watts (55) also made big contributions, as the Irish bowling conceded their highest total in this tournament – 324 for 8.

Founded in 1920 as the Rochester, New York, chapter of the Poetry Society of America, the group ceased its affiliation with the Society in the 1980s in order to accept a wider variety of members. At that time, the organization adopted its current name.\nFrom June 2005 to May 2013, meeting/workshops were held monthly on the third (later fourth) Saturday at the Center at High Falls Gallery; the Gallery closed in June 2013, and subsequent meetings were held at various venues such as Panera Bread restaurants in the Rochester area.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, the organization held monthly readings at Writers & Books. In January 2006, the venue was changed to St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, NY, where it held a reading on the third Sunday of each month in the Ross Art Gallery of the Skalny Welcome Center. In August, 2015, the group moved to the Clover Center for Arts & Spirituality in Brighton, NY. In March 2017, they moved to the Legacy at Clover Blossom complex, also in Brighton, and to Legacy at Cranberry Landing in Irondequoit, NY in early 2018. \n\nA large portion of the Rochester Poetry Society and Rochester Poets correspondence, minutes and other documents from 1922 to 1973 are archived in the Rare Books and Special Collection Department of the Rush Rhees Library located at the University of Rochester.\n\nRochester Poets sends out regular email flyers of area literary events, publishes a monthly newsletter and \"The Pinnacle Hill Review\"*, an annual anthology of selected member work. The group maintains a website, a mailing list (informing subscribers of area literary events) which can be joined via the website, and a blog.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2011, Rochester Poets sponsored an annual Poets Against the War event for the Rochester area. From April 2007 until September 2009, they co-sponsored a monthly series of readings at the Anti-War Storefront of the Peace, Action & Education Committee of Rochester MetroJustice.\n\nIn 2006, they began sponsoring annual World Poetry Day and National Poetry Month celebrations at St. John Fisher College in March and April of each year; the World Poetry Day event was merged with the April National Poetry Month event in 2009. The Celebration is open to poets, musicians and singers of all ages and levels from throughout the region.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, the group sponsored an Emerging Poets event in December of each year at St. John Fisher College. The event was open to poets of all ages; the primary criterion for eligibility was that participants were not yet \"established\" with a published volume of poems or had a significant number of poems appear in literary journals. From 2007 to 2011, the group also hosted the weekly Free Speech Zone series each Tuesday at the Tango Cafe in Rochester; the series moved to Mondays in 2011 before it was suspended in December 2011 pending finding a new venue.\n\nThe group's anthology has had various titles over the years, among them \"The Oracle\", \"Touchstone\", \"The Gleam\", \"In Between Seasons\", \"Images\", \"Daylight Burning Lanterns\", \"Disguised As Shapes You Love\", and, most recently, \"The Pinnacle Hill Review\". Many of the volumes are held by the Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection.\n\nThe group was founded by Edith Willis Forbes, who was also active in the Women's Education and Industrial Union, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Door of Hope; its first president was Carl Lamson Carmer.

The majority of the project would be along the sidewalks bordering two sides of Rochester's Memorial Art Gallery. The relationship between the City and Art Walk deteriorated, and eventually, a new entity, The Art Walk Extension Project, was created. Two of the proposed developments for the Extension were a Poets Walk, to be constructed in 2012 as a redesigned front sidewalk of MAG on University, and a Fiction Writers Walk, still in development, on the east side of the Gallery along Goodman.\n\nMany of those nominated for inclusion in Poets Walk were poets (a number of them deceased) who were members of Rochester Poets or had been honored by or affiliated with the group in some way.

{"id": "2152463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152463", "title": "Robert Knolles", "text": "Robert Knolles\n\nSir Robert Knolles or Knollys ( – 15 August 1407) was an important English knight of the Hundred Years' War, who, operating with the tacit support of the Crown, succeeded in taking the only two major French cities, other than Calais and Poitiers, to fall to Edward III. His methods, however, earned him infamy as a freebooter and a ravager: the ruined gables of burned buildings came to be known as \"Knollys' mitres\".\n\nBorn in Cheshire, Knolles first appears as the captain of several castles throughout Brittany in the mid-14th century, including Fougeray, Gravelle and Chateaublanc. He was one of the English champions at the Combat of the Thirty in 1351, where he was captured. He then contributed himself and 800 men to the 1356 chevauchée of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster through Normandy, a diversionary campaign to draw King John II of France north and thus leave the Black Prince free to embark on the famous Poitiers campaign. With France in disarray after the Battle of Poitiers, King Charles II of Navarre assumed command of the rebellion in Paris, and Knolles joined up with the army of Charles's brother Philip as they temporarily held the capital against the Dauphin in 1358.\n\nKnolles' finest hours were to come that autumn when he led a Great Company of 2,000–3,000 Anglo-Gascons into the Loire Valley, establishing several forward garrisons at important towns like Châteauneuf-Val-de-Bargis. He then advanced into the Nivernais, which was unsuccessfully defended for Margaret III of Flanders by the Archpriest Arnaud de Cervole, the adventurer who had raised the first Great Company the previous year.\n\nIn 1359 Knolles reached Auxerre, which fell after a two-month siege on 10 March. After the city had surrendered, Knolles was knighted by two subordinates, previously he had formally only been ranked as a squire. The sack of Auxerre proceeded with little violence and destruction, Knolles and his soldiers were professionals who intended to maximize their profit. The city was carefully ransacked for valuables and the citizens assessed for ransom. At the end a huge ransom was extorted for not destroying the city, although this was only partly paid. The following month he returned to Chateauneuf to plot the invasion of the Rhône Valley with Hugh Calveley. Marching south, a forward base was established on the Allier River at Pont-du-Chateau, from where they launched the invasion of the Velay. Knolles then reunited with Calveley to besiege the important city of Le Puy, which fell in July 1359. As they continued to the Papal city of Avignon, their path was barred by the army of Thomas de la Marche, Deputy for Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, at which point both English commanders retreated and dissolved their companies.\n\nAt the climax of the Breton War of Succession he participated in John de Montfort's siege of Auray in July 1364, the prelude to John's decisive victory at the Battle of Auray in September. He joined the Black Prince at the Battle of Nájera (Navarrete) of 1367.\n\nIn 1370 he was given a large grant of lands and money to raise an army to invade northern France. He landed at Calais in August with 6,000 mounted men and carried out a raid deep into French territory, burning villages on the outskirts of Paris but failing to bring the French King Charles V out to battle. He then turned towards Gascony and began capturing and fortifying castles and churches in the region between the rivers Loir and Loire. However he had to cope with much criticism from his younger subordinate commanders such as Sir John Minsterworth who were spoiling for a fight. When it became known that French armies under the command of Bertrand du Guesclin were closing in on them, Knolles proposed to retreat into Brittany but most of the army refused. He therefore marched away with his own retinue, leaving the bulk of the army where they were, to be comprehensively defeated and slaughtered at the Battle of Pontvallain on 4 December.\n\nKnolles passed the winter in his castle at Derval on the Breton March and afterwards attempted to evacuate his men and those of Minsterworth, who had managed to join him with his surviving troop, from the port of Saint-Mathieu. However, for lack of ships most of the English soldiers had to be left behind on the shore, to be wiped out by the French under Olivier de Clisson. In 1372 Knolles was found by the King's Council to bear the major responsibility for this disaster. He was stripped of the lands that had been given him as his fee for raising the army and fined 10,000 marks.\n\nHe named Thomas Knollys as one of the executors of his estate in 1389. He died at his seat in Sculthorpe, Norfolk on 15 August 1407.\n\nHe also founded Trinity Hospital, Pontefract and helped to suppress the Peasants' Revolt.\n\nKnolles' coat of arms decorates the postern tower of Bodiam Castle, Sussex. It was a statement of loyalty to Knolles by its builder, Edward Dalyngrigge who served under Knolles in a Free Company during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nBibliography\n"}

If there exists an antiisomorphism between two structures, they are said to be \"antiisomorphic.\"\n\nIntuitively, to say that two mathematical structures are \"antiisomorphic\" is to say that they are basically opposites of one another.\n\nThe concept is particularly useful in an algebraic setting, as, for instance, when applied to rings.\n\nLet \"A\" be the binary relation (or directed graph) consisting of elements {1,2,3} and binary relation formula_1 defined as follows:\n\nLet \"B\" be the binary relation set consisting of elements {\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"} and binary relation formula_5 defined as follows:\n\nNote that the opposite of \"B\" (denoted \"B\") is the same set of elements with the opposite binary relation formula_9 (that is, reverse all the arcs of the directed graph):\n\nIf we replace \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" with 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we see that each rule in \"B\" is the same as some rule in \"A\".

It was created by the OpenGL ARB (OpenGL Architecture Review Board) to give developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use ARB assembly language or hardware-specific languages.\n\nWith advances in graphics cards, new features have been added to allow for increased flexibility in the rendering pipeline at the vertex and fragment level. Programmability at this level is achieved with the use of fragment and vertex shaders.\n\nOriginally, this functionality was achieved by writing shaders in ARB assembly language – a complex and unintuitive task. The OpenGL ARB created the OpenGL Shading Language to provide a more intuitive method for programming the graphics processing unit while maintaining the open standards advantage that has driven OpenGL throughout its history. \n\nOriginally introduced as an extension to OpenGL 1.4, GLSL was formally included into the OpenGL 2.0 core in 2004 by the OpenGL ARB. It was the first major revision to OpenGL since the creation of OpenGL 1.0 in 1992. \n\nSome benefits of using GLSL are:\n\nGLSL versions have evolved alongside specific versions of the OpenGL API. It is only with OpenGL versions 3.3 and above that the GLSL and OpenGL major and minor version numbers match. These versions for GLSL and OpenGL are related in the following table:\n\nOpenGL ES and WebGL use OpenGL ES Shading Language (abbreviated: GLSL ES or ESSL).\nThe two languages are related but not directly compatible. They can be interconverted through SPIR-Cross.\n\nGLSL contains same operators as the operators in C and C++, with the exception of pointers. Bitwise operators were added in version 1.30.\n\nSimilar to the C programming language, GLSL supports loops and branching, for instance: if-else, for, switch, etc. Recursion is forbidden and checked for during compilation.\n\nUser-defined functions are supported and built-in functions are provided. The graphics card manufacturer may optimize built-in functions at the hardware level. Many of these functions are similar to those in the math library of the C programming language while others are specific to graphics programming. Most of the built-in functions and operators, can operate both on scalars and vectors (up to 4 elements), for one or both operands. Common built-in functions that are provided and are commonly used for graphics purposes are: , , , , , , , , , , and vector and . Other functions like , , , etc, are provided but they can also all operate on vector quantities, i.e. . GLSL supports function overloading (for both built-in functions and operators, and user-defined functions), so there might be multiple function definitions with the same name, haveing different number of parameters or parameter types. Each of them can have own independent return type.\n\nGLSL defines a subset of the C preprocessor (CPP), combined with its own special directives for specifying versions and OpenGL extensions. The parts removed from CPP are those relating to file names such as and .\n\nThe extension (implemented for example in Nvidia drivers on Windows and Linux, and all Mesa 20.0.0 drivers on Linux, FreeBSD and Android) implements ability to use in source code, allowing easier sharing of code and definitions between many shaders without extra manual pre-processing. Similar extension and exist for using GLSL with Vulkan, and are supported in reference SPIR-V compiler ( aka glslangValidator).\n\nGLSL shaders are not stand-alone applications; they require an application that utilizes the OpenGL API, which is available on many different platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows). There are language bindings for C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Delphi, Java and many more.\n\nGLSL shaders themselves are simply a set of strings that are passed to the hardware vendor's driver for compilation from within an application using the OpenGL API's entry points. Shaders can be created from within an application, or read-in as text files, but must be sent to the driver in the form of a string.\n\nThe set of APIs used to compile, link, and pass parameters to GLSL programs are specified in three OpenGL extensions, and became part of core OpenGL as of OpenGL Version 2.0. The API was expanded with geometry shaders in OpenGL 3.2, tessellation shaders in OpenGL 4.0 and compute shaders in OpenGL 4.3. These OpenGL APIs are found in the extensions:\n\nGLSL shaders can also be used with Vulkan, and are a common way of using shaders in Vulkan. GLSL shaders are precompiled before use, or at runtime, into a binary bytecode format called SPIR-V, usually using offline compiler.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the union's 2004 convention, Stern declared that workers should reform the AFL-CIO or \"build something stronger.\" Over the next year, a discussion of the labor movement's future ensued with a degree of openness that was unusual for the often cloistered labor movement.\n\nIn 2005, the NUP formally dissolved and its five member unions, along with the Teamsters Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), created a new coalition, Change to Win, which introduced a program for reform of the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe coalition was founded on two basic principles:\n\nAmong the coalition's proposals to achieve these objectives was encouraging unions to organize on an industry-wide basis, consolidating smaller unions within a few large unions, providing financial incentives to AFL-CIO member unions that channel resources to organizing new members and spending more money on organizing as opposed to electoral politics.\n\nThe new union's members were largely service sector unions which represented large numbers of women, immigrants and people of color, as opposed to the manufacturing unions which formed the basis of labor's strength for many years.\n\nIn July 2005, Change to Win elected SEIU secretary-treasurer Anna Burger as chair and UNITE HERE Executive Vice-President Edgar Romney as Treasurer.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters disaffiliated from Change to Win.\n\nAfter a bitter and divisive internal battle, a third of the members of UNITE HERE left that union and joined SEIU. The remaining 265,000 members of UNITE HERE reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO on September 16, 2009.\n\nThe Laborers' International Union of North America said it would also leave Change to Win and rejoin the AFL-CIO on August 13, 2010. LIUNA officials did not immediately explain their reasons, but AFL-CIO officials said the reaffiliation would be formalized in October 2010.\n\nOn August 8, 2013, the United Food and Commercial Workers announced that they would be leaving Change to Win and re-affiliating with the AFL-CIO.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, national news media reported that the five of the seven CtW unions had met with seven of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO in talks which explored the possibility of the five CtW unions rejoining the larger labor federation. Impetus for the talks came as the Obama administration signalled to both labor federations that it preferred to deal with a united rather than fragmented labor movement. Also, several Change to Win unions also concluded that they were not getting any significant advantage from being in a separate labor federation, and that a fragmented labor union was doing more harm than good. David Bonior, a former U.S. Congressman who once led the AFL-CIO's American Rights at Work division and who was a member of Barack Obama's presidential transition team, facilitated the meeting, and said talks were scheduled to last several weeks. The five CtW unions present included the Laborers, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE HERE. AFL-CIO unions present included AFSCME, the AFT, the Electrical Workers, the UAW, and the United Steelworkers. Also in attendance was Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, which is independent and belongs to neither group.\n\nA number of major issues were discussed in the opening round of talks. One major point of discussion revolved around who would lead any reunited federation. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney was widely expected to retire at the trade union center's August 2009 convention, and Laborer's president Terence O'Sullivan and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka had been discussed as his successors. The nature of the AFL-CIO presidency was part of the leadership talks, with some unions suggesting that the presidency rotate among member unions while others hoped for a strong and vocal \"executive director\" position. The two sides agreed that any reunited labor federation should have a stronger voice in national politics as well as have a greater say in helping member unions engage in more new member organizing. The two sides also discussed whether to change the name of the AFL-CIO, or whether to adopt an entirely new organizational structure. Among other issues discussed were: How the AFL-CIO/new organization would encourage new member organizing and at what level (national or local), what a reunited labor movement's political priorities should be, what sort of relationship a reunited labor movement will have with the Democratic and Republican parties, the level of member union dues, and globalization issues. Although one news outlet reported that the 12 unions hoped to settle on a reunification agreement by April 15, 2009, no issues were resolved in the first round of talks.\n\nThe talks drew some limited criticism from members of the labor movement for not addressing issues of union democracy.\n\nChange to Win has focused its resources on organizing workers into unions. This focus has been written into its governing documents, which require at least 75% of CtW's resources and budget to be allocated to organizing programs.\n\nCtW and its affiliate unions have run several campaigns to organize workers in industries considered \"core\" to CtW unions. These campaigns are:\n\nChange to Win and its affiliate unions are running multiple campaigns at present, including:\n\n\nThe Emerald Cities Collaborative is a partner organization with the Change to Win Federation.\n\n"}

Rush, known as Rush in the PSP version, is an open world racing video game developed by Midway Studios - Newcastle and published by Midway Games, released in North America for PlayStation 2 and Xbox (not compatible with Xbox 360) on October 10, 2005, and on October 21 in Europe. It is also released for Microsoft Windows on November 4 in Europe, and for PlayStation Portable on October 30, 2006. It is the fourth and final installment in the \"Rush\" series.\n\nMany details were revealed at E3 in May 2005, the game was also planned to be available on Gizmondo, but it got cancelled due to the discontinuation of Gizmondo on February 6, 2006. The game features voice talent from Orlando Jones, Bill Bellamy, Andre 3000 and Twista. \n\nThe game features free-roaming with races mechanic similar to those in \"\". The GPS map can have a point assigned to a certain location and then the point shows up on the radar during gameplay. It is also features two missions and two game modes. Other features includes 50 vehicles, 30 different cruise missions (can be playable with another player on the PSP version, when connected with a Wi-Fi), upgrades for cars (available from multiple top-line manufacturers and West Coast Customs) and a hip-hop and rock soundtrack from various artists, such as Twista, Lil' Kim, Skinny Puppy, J-Kwon, and Rock 'n Roll Soldiers.\n\nThere are two modes in the game, the Battle mode (which was first introduced in the home version of Rush 2049) lets the players go head-to-head with each other in a power-up-propelled race, while the Stunt Arena mode (which was featured all other home Rush games) is only available in the PSP version of the game, where the player must launch their car off the ramp and fly through the air and performing different tricks. In order to keep up with points, the player must land their car safely on all four wheels.\n\nAside to two modes, there are two missions available, the Reacquire missions involves the player must recover their cars that has been repossessed from the game storyline and must bring them back to the garage without taking too much damage, whilst being outrun against enemy's cars. The Retribution missions involves property damage where the player is tasked to destroy various things that belongs to the enemy in various different ways, such as smashing through enemy's billboards, destroying a ferris wheel by simply crashing into it, or even taking the enemy's car and let it being smashed by a train.\n\nThe game features many licensed cars like Japanese cars such as the Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec-V, Subaru Impreza WRX STI, Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34), Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII, Nissan 350Z. Muscle cars, such as the Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Charger, Buick GNX, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Chevelle SS. Sports cars, such as the Lotus Elise, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 (C5), Dodge Viper SRT-10, Pontiac Solstice, Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. SUVs and Pickup Trucks, such as the Cadillac Escalade, Hummer H2, Infiniti FX45, Nissan Frontier, Nissan Titan, and Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. The fastest car is the Saleen S7, which is the only supercar to be available in the game. Up to 50 playable cars are featured in the game, 30 of them are licensed cars, while 20 of them were Midway concept cars.\n\nThe game revolves around Trikz Lane (Luis Da Silva), a renowned street racer in the L.A. underground scene, who has a lavish lifestyle and a well-known sizable reputation, owning a mansion in Beverly Hills and a large collection of cars. One night, he throws a party in his mansion, while being interviewed by the journalist from Rides magazine, accomplished along with his friend, Ty Malix (Orlando Jones), the duo explain the journalist about how they got started street racing and won their first ten grant of money using Trikz's car, which itself referred as the \"go-kart\", a Nissan 240SX (S14). Ty later stated that soon would be appreciated that the car will be featured on the next cover for Rides magazine. Soon, the crew from West Coast Customs, Ryan Friedlinghaus, Quinton \"Q\" Dodson, Michael \"Mad Mike\" Martin and Dana \"Big Dane\" Florence approaches and greets the duo, the crew then asked Trikz about the modifications for his car before they left him and Ty to continue the interview. As the crew leaves, Trikz and Ty were later being met by a local race promoter, Lidell Rey (Bill Bellamy), who is hosting on a major series of street races across L.A., known as the Lidell Rey Street Slam, and is not particularly fond of Trikz. Trikz later tells Lidell that by the end of summer, he would let him pay for his new vacation spot in Maui, Hawaii and has plans to steal Lidell's girlfriend, Lana. Lidell tries to tip the scales against him, telling Trikz that changes are coming, before he drops an amount of pennies from his hat into the floor and leaves. As the journalist asked Trikz for the preparation of the upcoming races, Trikz told them that he will be always prepared once he finished his vacation in Saint Barthélemy for two weeks.\n\nTwo weeks later, Trikz and Ty comes back home from their vacation, only found out that their mansion is now on the ruins, the whole place is deserted with nothing left inside, the cars that are stored in the garage were missing, all but only left is Trikz's 240SX being sat abandoned in the driveway. While left entirely curious about the empty mansion, Trikz later saw a tow truck reposessioning Ty's Hummer H2, the duo tries to catch up, but unable to do so. Suddenly, a car pulled over in front of the mansion front doors, the driver hands over a paper to Trikz before drives away, Trikz realizes that his mansion has been robbed by Lidell, Ty reveals that Lidell uses his connections in order to rob Trikz's mansion and steal all of the cars whilst Trikz was on vacation. The duo later plots a plan to get payback against Lidell by entering a various series of street racing while recovering the lost cars that have been stashed across Los Angeles.\n\nMany reviewers have been critical of the game. One common criticism is that the option to customize the cars was poorly realised; players cannot modify them themselves, instead, the car is automatically upgraded by the West Coast Customs crew. GamesRadar says: \"\"Roll your vehicle into the garage and they'll kit it out with what they feel like\"\".\n\n\"L.A. Rush\" has also been criticised for not including every area of Los Angeles; for example, the San Fernando Valley was excluded.\n\nNot all reaction was negative. The realistic handling in the game was welcomed by some as being comparable to the handling in \"Juiced\" and \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2152490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152490", "title": "Movie Battles", "text": "Movie Battles\n\nMovie Battles II or MBII is a team-based, last man standing multiplayer mod of the shooter game \"\". The primary purpose of the mod is to allow players to experience setpiece battle scenes straight from the nine main \"Star Wars\" films and the expanded universe, immersing themselves directly in parts of the three \"Star Wars\" trilogies. This means that most of the original aspects of the game have been changed and only a few of the original gameplay features remain. The game pits one team of Galactic Empire/ Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) / First Order forces against the Rebel Alliance / Galactic Republic / Resistance forces, either of which attempt to complete an objective, or to eliminate all members of the enemy team.\n\n\"Movie Battles II\" is a team based shooter game, in which the player joins the Dark Side of the Force (represented by the Galactic Empire, the Separatists, or the First Order), or the Lights Side (the Rebel Alliance, the Galactic Republic, or the Resistance). Both teams usually have objectives which can be completed to win the round. The player also gets a number of points which he can spend on upgrades for his character. Any players who are killed before the end of the round become spectators. They may follow certain players who are still alive or free-roam in the spectator cam, similar to other first-person shooters, such as \"Battlefield 2\".\n\nThe lightsaber combat in \"Movie Battles\" is changed from the original system substantially. Blocking and defensive moves are favored over the unmodded game's \"swing-spam\". There are meters for both force pool and block stamina which deplete as the player intercepts incoming blaster and lightsaber attacks. Similar to \"Counter-Strike\", \"Movie Battles\" uses an objective system, where one team defends and the other one attacks one or more objectives. Objective types are usually variants on common themes, such as \"slicing panels\", or NPC guarding. By using such a system, it is significantly different from most \"Star Wars\" games, where the goal is often simply to kill everyone on the other team.\n\n\"MBII\" includes five main game modes: Open, Semi-Authentic, Full Authentic, Legends, and Duel. Depending on the gametype, the characters and features such as weapons a player can choose can be limited or not. In Open mode, everything can be chosen, while in Semi Authentic and Full Authentic only the models that fit to the current map can be chosen, and in Legends there are the same predefined models on all maps; in Full Authentic and Legends the features are also predefined, the diffrence being that in Full Authentic the features are map-determinded, while in Legends they are the same on all maps. The Duel game mode is similar to Open, the diffrence being that players may only choose between Jedi or Sith character models, and that there are unlimited lives; the purpose of the Duel mode is to allow players to recreate lightsaber duels from the films or other \"Star Wars\" media.\n\n\"MBII\" features a costumizable character class systems, similarly to games like \"Battlefield 2\"; it is mainly utilized in the Open, Semi-Authentic, and Duels game modes, as the others have predefined classes. Aside from appearance, based on various characters from the \"Star Wars\" franchise, each class also has a costumizable set of abilities, which cost a specific number of points; there are a total of 80 points to be spent. The Rebel, Republic or Resistance side (map dependent) have access to a number of specific classes, including Clone troopers (armed with repeater blaster rifles), ARC troopers (who are either very agile and equipped with light weapons, or use heavy weapons, such as rocket launchers, depending on the player's choice), and Wookiees (who are strongest melee class in the game, but may also wield weapons such as bowcasters or frag grenades). The Imperial, Separatist or First Order side (map dependent) have access to a number of specific classes as well: Droidekas (who are the fastest class in the game when they roll, and are equipped with arm blasters and protective shields), Super battle droids (who move slowly, but have a high amount of health and may knock down opponets with a single melee attack), and Mandalorians (who can adapt to almost any situation they find themselves in, as they utilize a wide arsenal of weapons and other useful equipment, including jet packs, flamethrower, wrist rockets, pistols and sniper rifles). Both teams also have access to a number of similar classes, namely soldiers (whose main trait is that they can have multiple lives, at the expense of low health and a moderate arsenal), commanders (who, similarly to soldiers, may have multpile lives, but have a better arsenal and may have an ability that allows soldiers to spawn at their location), heroes / bounty hunters (a sniper class, who move fast and have access to several other weapons, including blasters and grenades, as well as unique abilities such as regenerativehealth for the heroes, or tracking and poisonous darts for the bounty hunters), and Jedi / Sith (who can wield lightsabers - normal, dual, or double-bladed - that deal high amounts of damage or deflect blaster fire, and have access to a number of Force abilities - jump, push, full, and sense, as well as either mind trick and speed for the Jedi, or grip and lighting for the Sith).\n\nThe \"Movie Battles mod\" was started by Richard Hart (online alias RenegadeOfPhunk) in 2003, with the goal of mixing the round- and objective based gameplay of \"Counter-Strike\" with the lightsaber and gun mechanics of Star Wars. The first versions of the mod were developed for \"\", the previous game in the \"Jedi Knight\" series. This version already had the key elements of \"Movie Battles\" in it, such as the modified lightsaber combat and the last man standing system. The mod was later remade for \"\" which is the version worked on and played today. An offspring to \"Movie Battles\", mod titled \"The New Era\" (TNE) was in development for the Source engine which would have allowed for improved graphics and a better physics engine, but the game was cancelled in 2013. It was thought of as a successor to \"Movie Battles\", but \"TNE\" was moving into a different, more Deathmatch like genre. Many of the development team for \"TNE\" were members of the \"Movie Battles\" development team. On April 2, 2011, a trailer revealing a sequel was released. \"Movie Battles 3\" was going to be a standalone, free game developed on the Unreal Engine, but due to a general disinterest among developers and the game's community, coupled with the lack of developers willing to stay on board the project to begin with, it was cancelled after a few years in development, and \"Movie Battles 2\" development was resumed. The latest update, 1.5.5, was released on October 27, 2019.\n\nIn 2005 the UK edition of \"PC Gamer\" printed an article covering the mod. In the same year Sky News mentioned \"Movie Battles\" alongside other user-made game modifications. It was also mentioned by Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Alec Meer in the sites 2015 list of best \"Star Wars\" video games. Of the mod, Meer said the mod was something players should \"probably [...] check out.\" Matthew Znadowicz of Eurogamer Poland called the game's action \"unique and fresh\", yet noted that battles often became \"stressful, intense, but extremely pleasant.\" As of June 2016, 400 users on the website \"Mod DB\" have rated the game with the average score of 9.4.\n"}

Stereotypically, pochos speak English and lack fluency in Spanish. Among some Mexican Americans, the term has been embraced to express pride in having both a Mexican and an American heritage asserting their place in the diverse American culture. \n\nThe word derives from the Spanish word \"pocho\", used to describe fruit that has become rotten or discolored.\n\nIn general, the word \"pocho\" can sometimes have these different meanings:\n\n\nPochos are usually identified by their use of poorly-spoken Spanish. Code switching and the use of loanwords is common as is the use of phrases popular in American culture translated to Spanish, sometimes literally. Code switching often involves inserting English preposition or objective nouns, such as, \"\"Voy a ir\" shopping \"ahora en el\" supermarket\" (I am going shopping now at the supermarket). \n\nModified loanwords are referred to as \"pochismos\". Examples include \"mopear\" for \"trapear\" (to mop), \"parquear\" for \"estacionar\" (to park), or \"chequear\" for \"mirar\" or \"verificar\" (to check, to inspect or to verify). A clear example of a popular American phrase that has been adopted by people familiar with both cultures would be Clint Eastwood's famous quote \"Make my day\", which has been increasingly used in Spanish as \"Hacer mi día.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152506", "title": "BlackRock", "text": "BlackRock\n\nBlackRock, Inc. is an American global investment management corporation based in New York City. Founded in 1988, initially as a risk management and fixed income institutional asset manager, BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with $7.4 trillion in assets under management as of end-Q4 2019. BlackRock operates globally with 70 offices in 30 countries and clients in 100 countries. Due to its power, and the sheer size and scope of its financial assets and activities, BlackRock has been called the world's largest shadow bank.\n\nBlackRock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson to provide institutional clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective. Fink, Kapito, Golub and Novick had worked together at First Boston, where Fink and his team were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States. During Fink's tenure, he had lost $100 million as head of First Boston. That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary practices. Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Pete Peterson of The Blackstone Group who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management. Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management. In exchange for a 50 percent stake in the bond business, initially Blackstone gave Fink and his team a $5 million credit line. Within months, the business had turned profitable, and by 1989 the group's assets had quadrupled to $2.7 billion. The percent of the stake owned by Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff.\n\nBy 1992, Blackstone had a stake equating to about 35% of the company, and Schwarzman and Fink were considering selling shares to the public. The firm adopted the name BlackRock in 1992, and by the end of that year, BlackRock was managing $17 billion in assets. At the end of 1994, BlackRock was managing $53 billion. In 1994, Blackstone Group's Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink had an internal dispute over methods of compensation and over equity. Fink wanted to share equity with new hires, to lure talent from banks, unlike Schwarzman, who did not want to further lower Blackstone's stake. They agreed to part ways, so the BlackRock partners (Sue Wagner) orchestrated a deal to sell part of the company. In June 1994, Blackstone sold a mortgage-securities unit with $23 billion in assets to PNC Bank Corp. for $240 million. The unit had traded mortgages and other fixed-income assets, and during the sales process the unit changed its name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock Financial Management. Schwarzman remained with Blackstone, while Fink went on to become chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc. In 1998, PNC’s equity, liquidity, and mutual fund activities were merged into BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock went public in 1999 at $14 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. By the end of 1999, BlackRock was managing $165 billion in assets. BlackRock grew both organically and by acquisition. In August 2004, BlackRock made its first major acquisition, buying State Street Research & Management's holding company SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for $325 million in cash and $50 million in stock. The acquisition raised BlackRock's assets under management from $314 billion to $325 billion. The deal included the mutual-fund business State Street Research & Management in 2005. BlackRock merged with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM) in 2006, halving PNC's ownership and giving Merrill Lynch a 49.5% stake in the company. In October 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Capital Management. \nThe U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help resolve the fallout of the financial meltdown of 2008. According to \"Vanity Fair\", the financial establishment in Washington and on Wall Street believed BlackRock was the best choice for the job. In 2009, BlackRock first became the No. 1 asset manager worldwide. In April 2009, BlackRock acquired R3 Capital Management, LLC and took control of the $1.5 billion fund. On 12 June 2009, Barclays sold its Global Investors unit (BGI), which included its exchange traded fund business, iShares, to BlackRock for US$13.5 billion. Through the deal, Barclays attained a near-20% stake in BlackRock.\n\nIn 2010, Ralph Schlosstein, the CEO of Evercore Partners and a BlackRock founder, called BlackRock \"the most influential financial institution in the world.\" On 1 April 2011, due to Sanofi's acquisition of Genzyme, BlackRock replaced it on the S&P 500 index.\n\nIn 2013, \"Fortune\" listed BlackRock on its annual list of the world's 50 Most Admired Companies. In 2014, \"The Economist\" said that BlackRock's $4 trillion under management made it the \"world's biggest asset manager\", and it was larger than the world's largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with $3 trillion. In May of the same year, BlackRock invested in Snapdeal.\n\nIn December 2014 a BlackRock managing director in London was banned by the British Financial Conduct Authority for failing the \"fit and proper\" test, because he paid £43,000 to avoid prosecution for dodging train fares. BlackRock said, \"Jonathan Burrows left BlackRock earlier this year. What he admitted to the FCA is totally contrary to our values and principles.\"\n\nAt the end of 2014, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute reported that 65% of Blackrock's assets under management were made up of institutional investors.\n\nBy June 30, 2015, BlackRock had US$4.721 trillion of assets under management. On August 26, 2015, BlackRock entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management provider with reported assets under management of $600 million. Under the deal, FutureAdvisor would operate as a business within BlackRock Solutions (BRS). BlackRock announced in November 2015 that they would wind down the BlackRock Global Ascent hedge fund after losses. The Global Ascent fund had been its only dedicated global macro fund, as BlackRock was \"better known for its mutual funds and exchange traded funds.\" At the time, BlackRock managed $51 billion in hedge funds, with $20 billion of that in funds of hedge funds.\n\nIn March 2017, the \"Financial Times\" announced that BlackRock, after a six-month review led by Mark Wiseman, had initiated a restructuring of its $8bn actively-managed fund business, resulting in the departure of seven portfolio managers and a $25m charge in Q2, replacing certain funds with quantitative investment strategies. In May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in both CRH plc and Bank of Ireland. By April 2017, iShares business accounted for $1.41tn, or 26 percent, of BlackRock's total assets under management, and 37 percent of BlackRock’s base fee income. In April 2017, BlackRock backed the inclusion of mainland Chinese shares in MSCI's global index for the first time.\n\nBetween October and December 2018, BlackRock's assets dropped by US$468bn and fell below $6tn. It was the largest decline between quarters since September 2011.\n\nAs of 2019, BlackRock holds 4.81% of Deutsche Bank, making it the single largest shareholder. This investment goes back to at least 2016.\n\nIn May 2019, BlackRock received criticism for the environmental impact of its holdings. It is counted among the top three shareholders in every oil \"supermajor\" except Total, and it is among the top 10 shareholders in 7 of the 10 biggest coal producers.\n\nIn his 2020 annual open letter, CEO Fink announced environmental sustainability as core goal for BlackRock's future investment decisions. BlackRock disclosed plans to sell US$500 million in coal investments.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, BlackRock reported earnings of US$4.970 billion, with an annual revenue of US$12.491 billion, an increase of 12.0% over the previous fiscal cycle. BlackRock's shares traded at over $414 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$61.7 billion in October 2018. As of 2018, BlackRock ranked 237 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.\nBlackRock's largest division is iShares, a family of over 800 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that comprises more than $1 trillion in assets under management. iShares is the largest provider of ETFs in the U.S. and in the world.\n\nIn 2000, BlackRock launched BlackRock Solutions, the analytics and risk management division of BlackRock, Inc. The division grew from the Aladdin System (which is the enterprise investment system), Green Package (which is the Risk Reporting Service) PAG (portfolio analytics) and AnSer (which is the interactive analytics). BlackRock Solutions (BRS) serves two roles within BlackRock. First, BlackRock Solutions is the in-house investment analytics and “process engineering” department for BlackRock which works with their portfolio management teams, risk and quantitative analysis, business operations and every other part of the firm that touches the investment process. Second, BlackRock Solutions (BRS) and the three primary divisions are services that offered to institutional clients. As of 2013, the platform had nearly 2,000 employees.\n\nBlackRock differentiates itself from other asset managers by claiming its risk management is not separate. Risk management is the foundation and cornerstone of the firm's entire platform. Aladdin keeps track of 30,000 investment portfolios, including BlackRock's own along with those of competitors, banks, pension funds, and insurers. According to \"The Economist\", as at December 2013, the platform monitors almost 7 percent of the world’s $225 trillion of financial assets.\n\nBlackRock Solutions was retained by the U. S. Treasury Department in May 2009 to manage the toxic mortgage assets (i.e. to analyze, unwind, and price) that were owned by Bear Stearns, AIG, Inc., Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, and other financial firms that were affected in the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn 2017, BlackRock expanded its presence in sustainable investing and environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) with new staff and products both in USA and Europe with the aim to lead the evolution of the financial sector in this regard.\n\nBlackRock started using its weight to draw attention to environmental and diversity issues by means of official letters to CEOs and shareholder votes together with activist investors or investor networks like the Carbon Disclosure Project, which in 2017 backed a successful shareholder resolution for ExxonMobil to act on climate change. In 2018, it asked Russell 1000 companies to improve gender diversity on their board of directors if they had less than 2 women on them.\n\nAfter discussions with firearms manufacturers and distributors, on April 5, 2018, BlackRock introduced two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that exclude stocks of gun makers and large gun retailers, Walmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kroger, Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands Corporation, and Vista Outdoor, and removing the stocks from their seven existing environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) funds, in order “to provide more choice for clients seeking to exclude firearms companies from their portfolios.”\n\nDespite BlackRock's attempts to model itself as a sustainable investor, one report shows that BlackRock is the world’s largest investor in coal plant developers, holding shares worth $11 billion among 56 coal plant developers. Another report shows that BlackRock owns more oil, gas, and thermal coal reserves than any other investor with total reserves amounting to 9.5 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions – or 30 percent of total energy-related emissions from 2017. Concerned about global warming, environmental groups including the Sierra Club, and Amazon Watch launched a campaign called BlackRock's Big Problem in September 2018. In this campaign, these groups assert that BlackRock is the \"biggest driver of climate destruction on the planet\", due in part to its refusal to divest from fossil fuel companies. On January 10th, 2020 a group of climate activists rushed inside the Paris offices of Black Rock France painting walls and floors with warnings and accusations on the responsibility of the company in the current climate and social crises.\n\nOn January 14, 2020, BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink declared that environmental sustainability would be a key goal for investment decisions. BlackRock announced that it would sell $500 million worth of coal-related assets, and create funds that would avoid fossil-fuel stocks, two moves that would drastically shift the company's investment policy. Environmentalist Bill McKibben called this a \"huge, if not final, win for activists.\"\n\nIn his 2018 annual letter to shareholders, BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink stated that other CEOs should be aware of their impact on society. Anti-war organizations were discontent with Fink’s statement, because BlackRock is the largest investor in weapon manufacturers through its iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF. \n\nIn May 2018, anti-war organizations held a demonstration outside the annual BlackRock shareholder’s meeting in Manhattan, New York.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his #1 country hits \"Dust on the Bottle\" and \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\", as well as the hit songs \"Party Crowd\", \"Out with a Bang\", \"Every Time I Get Around You\", \"The Road You Leave Behind\", and \"Loco\". He has released five solo studio albums: \"Out with a Bang\" (1994), \"Gettin' Out the Good Stuff\" (1996), \"We Can't All Be Angels\" (1997), \"Tryin' to Get There\" (2004), and \"No Zip Code\" (2018). His songs \"Just Once\" and \"We Can't All Be Angels\" appeared on the soundtracks of the films \"8 Seconds\" (1994) and \"Black Dog\" (1998), respectively.\n\nMurphy took a hiatus from recording in 2004, and has co-written several singles for other artists, including the hits \"Living in Fast Forward\" for Kenny Chesney, \"Anywhere With You\" for Jake Owen, \"Big Green Tractor\" for Jason Aldean, and \"Are You Gonna Kiss Me or Not\" for Thompson Square. On April 6, 2018, Murphy and Kenny Chesney released a studio album together, \"No Zip Code\", which features their hit song \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\".\n\nMurphy was born Herrin, Illinois. By 1983, he had moved to Nashville, Tennessee, seeking a successful career in country music. Two years later, he was spotted by record producer Tony Brown at a club in Nashville, although Brown did not sign Murphy to a record deal until nearly a decade later. In the meantime, however, Murphy did co-write album cuts for Reba McEntire and Doug Stone.\n\nMurphy's first recording for MCA Nashville was the song \"Just Once\", which was included on the soundtrack to the 1994 film \"8 Seconds\". In 1994, \"Just Once\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, reaching #36. The same year, Murphy began work on his debut album \"Out with a Bang\", released in early 1995. The album produced three hit singles overall, including \"Party Crowd\", which became the most-played country song of 1995, as well as \"Dust on the Bottle\", a #1 single. \"Out with a Bang\" became the best-selling album for a new male country act in 1995 and was certified gold by the RIAA.\n\n\"Gettin' Out the Good Stuff\" was the title of Murphy's second album, released in 1996. It produced back-to-back Top 5 singles in \"Every Time I Get Around You\" and \"The Road You Leave Behind\". \"Every Time I Get Around You\" hit #2 on the \"RPM\" Country Tracks in Canada and was named that publication's top song for 1996.\n\nMurphy's third and final album for MCA, titled \"We Can't All Be Angels\", was released in 1997. In a 1997 interview, Murphy revealed that he had intended for this album to be experimental in nature, saying that he \"wanted to create just a whole different tone, sonically. I just wanted a different sounding record.\" \"We Can't All Be Angels\" had two singles, \"All Lit up in Love\" and \"Just Don't Wait Around 'Til She's Leavin'\", peaking at #25 and #37 on the country chart.\n\nBy the 2000s, Murphy had shifted his focus to songwriting. One of his first cuts in the 2000s was the title track to Aaron Tippin's 2000 album \"People Like Us\"; this song was a Top 20 for Tippin in 2001. Trick Pony also entered the country Top 20 a year later with another one of Murphy's compositions — the title track to their 2002 album \"On a Mission\". Murphy also co-wrote album cuts for several other artists, including Brooks & Dunn, Montgomery Gentry, and Hank Williams, Jr.\n\nKoch Entertainment signed Murphy to his second recording contract in 2004. That year, he released his fourth studio album, \"Tryin' to Get There\". The album, whose title track was co-written by Waylon Jennings prior to his death in 2002, produced the Top Five hit \"Loco\", which reached #5 in 2004. The only other single from \"Tryin' to Get There\" was \"Inspiration\", a collaboration with singer and guitarist Lee Roy Parnell, which peaked at #48.\n\nFollowing the closure of the Koch Nashville record label, Murphy continued working as a songwriter, scoring his first outside Number One with Kenny Chesney's 2006 single \"Living in Fast Forward\". 2007 produced three more chart singles co-written by Murphy: Gary Allan's \"A Feelin' Like That\" (co-written by Ira Dean, then a member of Trick Pony), Van Zant's \"Goes Down Easy\", and Blake Shelton's \"The More I Drink\". 2008 saw the release of Keith Anderson's \"Somebody Needs a Hug\" and the Eli Young Band's \"Always the Love Songs\", two more songs co-written by Murphy, and Jason Aldean topped the country charts in September 2009 with \"Big Green Tractor\", which Murphy wrote with Jim Collins. Josh Thompson charted in 2010 with \"Way Out Here\", another Murphy co-write.\n\nOther Murphy co-writes include Thompson Square's \"Are You Gonna Kiss Me or Not\" and \"Everything I Shouldn't Be Thinking About\", Kenny Chesney's \"Live a Little\", \"Pirate Flag\", and \"Bar at the End of the World\", Aldean's \"The Only Way I Know\", Jake Owen's \"Anywhere with You\", Blackberry Smoke's \"Ain't Much Left of Me\", and The Road Hammers' \"Get On Down the Road\".\n\nIn 2017, Murphy signed to Reviver Records and announced that he would release a new album, \"No Zip Code\". The album is produced by Kenny Chesney and Buddy Cannon, Chesney's longtime producer.\n\nMurphy is married to Donna (Restivo) and they have three sons. They live on a secluded farm just outside Nashville.\n\nIn 2000, Murphy hosted a series of concerts in his hometown of Herrin, Illinois, raising $25,000 for the Jack Murphy fund, which David Lee started in honor of his father, Dr. Jack Murphy, a local civic leader and educator.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2152540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152540", "title": "Pete Gray", "text": "Pete Gray\n\nPeter J. Gray (born Peter James Wyshner; March 6, 1915 – June 30, 2002) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played for the St. Louis Browns of Major League Baseball in 1945, despite having lost his right arm in a childhood accident.\n\nPeter Gray (sometimes also given as Peter Grey) was born as Peter J. Wyshner in the mining town of Nanticoke, Pennsylvania on March 6, 1915. He was one of five children born to Lithuanian immigrants Antoinette and Peter Wyshner. Pete's father worked in the coal mines of northeastern Pennsylvania to support his family. His older brother was a boxer in the middleweight division and went under the name Whitey Gray (boxed 1921–1928). During his time as a boxer Whitey Gray won 6 matches by KO, lost 5 (3 of which were KO's), had 3 newspaper decision wins, and 2 newspaper decision draws. In total, Whitey had 16 bouts with a 37.5% KO rate and boxed a total of 45 rounds.\n\nPete was right-handed until he lost his right arm at age seven or eight, when he got into a wagon accident in 1923. The arm had to be amputated above the elbow. He never could remember exactly how it happened and several versions of the story have emerged throughout the years. One of the final versions had it that Peter was sitting on a truck with friends and fell off, and his arm got stuck in the spokes of the old fashioned wheels. After the accident the driver dropped him on his family's porch and ran off. Gray's enthusiasm for baseball led him to learn to bat and field one-handed, catching the ball in his glove and then quickly removing his glove and transferring the ball to his hand in one motion.\n\nSeven years after his accident he completed his formal education and began working as a water boy at the Truesdale Colliery at the age of 13. Life was not easy for him and he did not take being treated with sympathy or being treated differently than others. One story that was told about his frustration with being treated differently was while a young man playing in sandlot. He ran home and crashed into the catcher, which helped knock the baseball out of the catcher's glove. This resulted in Peter being safe at home plate. The catcher was very upset and told Peter that he would hit him, if only he had two arms. Peter didn't take this well and got into the face of the catcher and told him to go ahead and try.\n\nBy 19 years of age he was playing outfield for the Hanover Lits Baseball Club of the Wyoming Valley Anthracite League. Later he played semi-professional ball with Pine Grove in Pennsylvania and Scranton in Brooklyn, New York. He had tryouts with the St. Louis Browns and Philadelphia Athletics, but was never called up by either team. He continued to play semi-pro and minor league baseball.\n\nIn 1941, after the attack of Pearl Harbor, Gray attempted to join the Army, but was denied on the basis that he was an amputee. Gray was quoted about being denied entrance into the Army that, \"If I could teach myself how to play baseball with one arm, I sure as hell could handle a rifle.\"\n\nHis speed and placehitting ability made him a successful minor league outfielder. Gray attained a batting average of .333 and a stolen-base record of 63; as a result, he was named the 1944 Southern Association's Most Valuable Player.\n\nDuring his career, Gray played for teams including the Trois-Rivières Renards of the Canadian–American League, the Memphis Chicks of the Southern Association and the Brooklyn Bushwicks.\n\nWhen Gray joined semi-professional ball he changed his last name, as his older brother had done as a boxer. He did this to avoid ethnic prejudices from other players, coaches, fans, and front offices at the time. In 1942 he signed with the minor league team called the Three Rivers Club of the Canadian–American League. At his first game the crowd poured out to see him. His chance to shine came in the bottom of the ninth. There were already two outs and the bases were loaded. As he approached the plate the crowd went crazy. He hit a line drive to the right field, which drove in both the tying and winning runs. The fans were so happy and excited that they threw money onto the field, roughly $700 total. While with the team that season he hit .381, but also broke his collarbone and tore a ligament, which meant he was only able to play in 42 games. His success and ability to draw a crowd helped get the Memphis Chicks, another minor league team, to notice him and then signed him. While climbing the ladder of the minors, sportswriters nicknamed him the \"One-Armed Wonder.\" Gray had about 6 successful seasons in the minors before joining the majors for one season, and then returned to the minors for about another 4 seasons as a journeyman. In 1944, while still with the Chicks, he batted .333 and had a league leading 68 stolen bases. That same year he was awarded the Most Valuable Player of the Southern Association and that year the Philadelphia Sports Writers recognized Pete Gray as the \"Most Courageous Athlete.\" Gray quickly responded with, \"Boys, I can't fight, and so there is no courage about me. Courage belongs on the battlefield, not on the baseball diamond.\"\n\nTeams played for:\nMinor League stats:\nThe St. Louis Browns of the American League purchased his contract in 1945 from the Chicks for $20,000, and Gray signed for $4,000. Wearing uniform number 14, Gray played left and center field for the Browns. He appeared in 77 games, batting .218 with a .958 fielding percentage in center field. He played competently in the outfield, transferring the ball from glove to hand with remarkable speed.\n\nHe collected his first major league hit (a single) against the Detroit Tigers on April 17, 1945. On May 19, he fulfilled his lifelong dream and played a double header in Yankee Stadium, collecting five hits and two RBI as the Browns swept the Yankees. The first game ended 10-1 and the second ended 5-1. Gray also proved himself an accomplished bunter. In order to bunt, he planted the knob of the bat against his side, and then slid his hand about one-third of the way up the shaft of the bat.\n\nAs the season progressed, it became apparent that Gray could not hit breaking pitches. Once he started his swing, he could not change his timing because he had no second hand to check the swing. Opposing pitchers discovered that fact and threw curve balls. His last big league appearance was on September 30, 1945.\n\nGray said in 1945, \"I've been turned down by more big-league managers than any other man in history. I've spent more money trying to get into baseball than I've earned on the game.\"\n\nHis relationship with his teammates was not great, and many were disgruntled because they were in the race to repeat as American League champions and they felt Gray slowed down their success. They also felt, and knew, he was really only there for ticket sales and to boost fan attendance. The previous year they had won the pennant but only had about 508,644 fans attend Sportsman's Park all season. Infielder Don Gutteridge later said in 1994, \"Some of the guys thought Pete was being used to draw fans late in the season when the club was still in the pennant race and he wasn't hitting well.\" These complaints do not hold up under statistical scrutiny which show that the team had a win percentage of .600 when he was on the field, and only .425 when he sat on the bench. That season they finished third and the next season without Gray they fell to seventh. That year with Gray was the Browns' last winning season before moving to Baltimore in 1954. Gray later said of his teammates, \"If they insulted me, I didn't pay attention. I mostly kept to myself. That's why I got the reputation of being tough to get along with. But, I've mellowed.\"\n\nGray's on-field exploits set an inspirational example for disabled servicemen returning from World War II, as was portrayed in newsreels of the period. He visited army hospitals and rehabilitation centers, speaking with amputees and reassuring them that they too could lead a productive life.\n\nMajor League stats:\nWhile playing the field, Pete Gray wore a glove without padding. When the ball was hit in his direction he would place the glove directly in front of himself; roughly about shoulder height. When the ball hit the glove he would roll the ball across his chest from left to right. During this motion he learned to rest the glove under his right stump and the ball would roll into his left hand.\nWhen ground balls were hit his way he would let it bounce off his glove at knee height and drop the glove completely to grab the ball while it was still in the air. He was faster in these motions and techniques than some players who had the use of both hands. When backing up another outfielder during a play, he would drop the glove completely and was ready to take the ball with his bare hand.\n\nWhile at bat he used a full weight bat. His position and stance at the plate was just like any other player. He placed his hand about six inches up on the handle. In order to bunt, he planted the knob of the bat against his side, and then slid his hand about one-third of the way up the shaft of the bat. He was described by sports writers and players as a pure pull hitter.\n\nGray's major league career ended that same year when many of baseball's stars returned from the battlefront and assumed their previous positions on the diamond. From 1946 to 1949, he played on as a journeyman minor leaguer with the Toledo Mud Hens, Elmira Pioneers and Dallas Stars. Gray returned home to Nanticoke where, although a local hero/celebrity, he struggled with gambling and alcohol, and lived in near poverty.\nHe also played in barnstorming games with exhibition teams up until the early 1950s. Having only accomplished one year in the majors, he spent the rest of his life wondering if he was ever really good enough to have been there or if he was just an entertainment attraction for the owners to make money. This personal struggle was one of the possible reasons for his struggle with gambling and alcohol after he left baseball. Before his death, however, he regained a sense of integrity about his accomplishments with the success of both the TV movie and the biography about his life.\n\nThe 1986 television-movie \"A Winner Never Quits\", starring Keith Carradine and Mare Winningham; and the publication of Gray's biography, \"One-Armed Wonder: Pete Gray, Wartime Baseball, and the American Dream\" written by William C. Kashatus, published in 1995 by McFarland & Company, renewed public interest in Gray.\n\nGray shunned public attention for most of his life after baseball. He died on June 30, 2002 at the age of 87 and is buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania. On Sunday, August 24, 2003, Gray was recognized by the Historical and Museum Commission in Pennsylvania when they placed a roadside marker in his hometown. The location of the marker is Front St., Hanover section, Nanticoke, Luzerne County in the Poconos / Endless Mountains Region.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152541", "title": "Erris", "text": "Erris\n\nErris is a barony in northwestern County Mayo in Ireland consisting of over , much of which is mountainous blanket bog. It has extensive sea coasts along its west and north boundaries. The main towns are Belmullet and Bangor Erris. The name Erris derives from the Irish 'Iar Ros' meaning 'western promontory'. The full name is the Iorrais Domnann, after the Fir Bolg tribe, the Fir Domnann. To its north is the wild Atlantic Ocean and the bays of Broadhaven and Sruth Fada Conn and to its west is Blacksod Bay. Its main promontories are the Doohoma Peninsula, Mullet Peninsula, Erris Head, the Dún Chiortáin and Dún Chaocháin peninsulas and Benwee Head.\n\nThere are five Catholic parishes in Erris: Kilcommon, Kilmore, Kiltane, Belmullet and Ballycroy.\n\nParts of Erris are in a Gaeltacht area, with first-language speakers of Irish in the following areas of the barony: An Fál Mór, Tamhaiin na hUltaí, Glais, Eachléim, Tearmann, Tránn, An Mullach Rua, Cartúr, An Baile Úr, Cill Ghallagáin, Corrán Buí, Ceathrú na gCloch, Port a' Chluaidh, Ros Dumhach and Ceathrú Thaidhg. The area with the most Irish speakers is Ceathrú Thaidhg. There are between 3,500-5,000 native Irish speakers in Erris.\n\nMuch of inland Erris is covered with blanket bog. A triangle between Ballycroy, Bellacorick and Bangor Erris consists of little else over its surface. Blanket bog, unlike raised bog, grows slowly across the landscape like a blanket covering the ground, due to a continuous supply of water from rainfall, maintaining waterlogged conditions on the ground. The bog is acidic with a pH of between 3.5 and 4.2. This is Atlantic blanket bog and it provides a suitable habitat for many species of flora, particularly small species of mosses, bryophytes, carnivorous plants and delicate flowers such as the scarlet pimpernel. Species of fauna found on Atlantic blanket bog, include smaller varieties such as frogs and insects as well as many bird varieties, not common elsewhere.\n\nSeveral areas of the blanket bog are protected under European legislation such as Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas (Birds Directive) and Natural Heritage Areas. These include the Glenamoy Bog Complex, Ballycroy National Park and Bellacorick.\n\nErris has a large range of habitats including blanket bogs, estuaries, salt marshes, fresh water lakes, coasts, cliffs, machair, sand dunes, sandy beaches and rocky shores. It is an important area for bird watchers as the largely treeless landscape allows relatively easy access for birdwatching. Brent geese overwinter here feeding along the estuaries, and corncrake, chough, rock dove and twite are sometimes seen at Erris Head. Sightings of rarer birds, such as the grey phalarope, booted warbler and Wilson's petrel, have also been recorded.\n\nThe oldest rocks in Ireland, some 1.8 billion years old, are to be found on the west coasts of Erris. Pink or orange striped gneisses are found along the beaches of Elly Bay and Annagh Head where they have become separated from the same rocks on the east coast of Northern Canada over hundreds of millions of years by the separation of tectonic plates in the mid Atlantic Ocean.\n\"Erris Head\" (Irish: \"Ceann Iorrais\") is a promontory at the northernmost tip of the Mullet Peninsula. It is a landmark known well by mariners and is one of the sea areas cited by Met Éireann's weather forecasters. The coastline of Erris has some of \"the grandest sea cliffs in Ireland\" over the Atlantic Ocean from where the next stop is the east coast of America. Erris Head is not served by any road and can only be reached by crossing a number of fields from the hamlet of Glenlara where the road ends.\n\nAlong the coast there are several uninhabited islands. These include the Inishkea Islands, Inishglora, Duvillaun, the Stags of Broadhaven Bay and other smaller islands.\n\nErris, in common with most of inland Ireland, became covered in extensive native woodland a few thousand years after the last Ice Age retreated (approx 15,000 years ago) but its northern and western shores remained relatively lightly afforested. Across inland Erris, the remains of these forests can be seen across the blanket bog landscape in the form of fossilised greying tree stumps which are mainly the remains of ancient Scots pine trees. These become most obvious where there has been harvesting of turf (peat) for fuel. The odd petrified bog oak can be found too.\n\nDuring the Neolithic period, starting about 6,000 years ago, the first people living in Ireland whose ancestors had hunted and gathered along the coastlines of Erris from about 9,000 years ago, began to cut down the forestry to clear land for growing crops and grazing livestock. Because the underlying rock type was ancient and heavily weathered schists the soil was thin and easily eroded by inclement weather. After a couple of years the crops began to fail and the Neolithic people had to clear the native woodlands further and further inland to clear more land for their crops. With minor changes in climate and high rainfall levels the land became blanketed by the bog and remains that way to the current day. When present-day turf cutters harvest the bog for fuel, archaeological remains, mainly from the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, which have become buried under the bog often come to light. Some archaeological sites are marked on Ordnance Survey maps.\n\nThe period of Early Christianity saw several small churches set up but no major religious houses came to the area. During the Plantations of Ireland, there were two major landlords in the area - the Binghams and the Carters. Oliver Cromwell's policy (mid 17th century) of sending the native Irish who refused to bow down to him \"to hell or to Connaught\" saw a large influx of population into Erris where the disinherited native Irish tried to eke a living from very poor quality agricultural land under the tenancy of the landlords and their agents. During the Irish Famine of 1845 - '47 many died in Erris despite the close proximity of the sea, because they could not raise the cash to fund a passage to America.\n\nSome 19th- and early 20th-century antiquarians and surveyors visited the Erris area and wrote about their experiences and thoughts on the area at that time. These include works by Patrick Knight (\"Erris in the Irish Highlands\"), Caesar Otway (\"Sketches in Erris and Tyrawley\") and Thomas Johnson Westropp (\"The Promontory Forts and Early Remains of the Coast of Mayo\"). The Ulster Cycle legend of the Táin Bó Flidhais concerns the Barony of Erris in the time period of approx the 1st century AD.\n\nThe community of Erris gave support to the extensive search and rescue operation following the 2017 Irish Coast Guard Rescue 116 crash. For its efforts, the community and the Irish Coast Guard were awarded a People of the Year Award in 2018.\n\nFolklore is an important part of the culture of Erris.\n\nA number of well-known folklore tales have their origins in (or are associated with) the area. The Children of Lir, according to tradition, are buried on the island of Inisglora. The children were turned into swans by their jealous stepmother and doomed to spend the next 900 years on lakes and waters in Ireland. When they finally reclaimed their human form on Inisglora, they were so old that they died and were buried there.\n\n\"Táin Bó Flidhais\" is the tale of a cattle raid in which raiders came to Erris from the Royal site at Cruachán (Rathcroghan) at Tulsk, Co. Roscommon to Rathmorgan Fort (Iorras Domhnann) at the south end of Carrowmore Lake in the centre of the Barony. The remains of Rathmorgan fort on top of the mountain can be seen from the road below.\n\nBrian Rua U'Cearbhain from Inver is remembered in folklore as the prophet of Erris.\n\nThe small village of Glencastle has some large mounds in the narrow valley that are not naturally occurring. They can be seen on the right hand side, close to the roadside on the approach to Belmullet from the east. These have never been archaeologically investigated but folklore legends recall that this was the old gateway into the Mullet and a toll had to be paid for each traveller who passed through or the traveller may never be seen again. There were no roads through this area of Mayo until less than two hundred years ago. In recent years the Glencastle Valley has been drastically altered by extensive quarrying.\n\nErris is a popular location for many types of watersports ranging through fishing, sailing, surfing, swimming, wind surfing, kiteboarding and kite surfing.\n\nThere are a number of walking trails in Erris. These include cliff walks above the Atlantic at Broadhaven Bay along Benwee Head, Glinsk and the North Mayo coastline, as well as mountain walks across uninhabited natural wilderness, and long distance walks such as the Bangor Trail and the Western Way.\n\nIn 1993, the Tír Sáile Sculpture Trail project was carried out to commemorate 5,000 years of habitation in County Mayo. This trail extends through parts of Erris from the tip of the Mullet Peninsula, through Kilcommon, Belderrig and Ballycastle. The first sculptures along this trail were erected in 1993, with several more added subsequently. The creation of the sculpture trail took the form of the Meitheal, a traditional method of working where a group of workers come together to achieve a common objective.\n\nErris has considerable potential for ocean energy in terms of its location next to the Atlantic Ocean and constant winds from the sea. These resources have been earmarked for development. There are opportunities for the development of ocean wave power projects, tidal power, hydroelectric schemes, and, wind farms amongst other clean, alternative energy generation opportunities for which the area is eminently suitable.\n\nThe discovery of the Corrib gas field in the Atlantic Ocean some 85 km off Broadhaven Bay has led to the Corrib gas project and ensuing controversy. Raw, unodourised natural gas from fields under the Atlantic Ocean is planned to be piped at high pressure at Glengad and through the townlands of Kilcommon, to a refinery 10 km inland. Documentaries have been made on the subject \n. A documentary film, The Pipe by local film-maker, Richard O'Donnell, had its first showing at the Galway Film Festival on Thursday 8 July 2010, went on general release in cinemas nationwide from 3 December 2010.\n"}

However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s. It was used in the House of Commons as early as 1805, and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s. In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the order of precedence. Modern historians generally consider Sir Robert Walpole, who led the government of Great Britain for over twenty years from 1721, as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition. However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first and Margaret Thatcher the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence. The first to use the title in an official act was Benjamin Disraeli, who signed the Treaty of Berlin as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland) was William Pitt the Younger. The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was Bonar Law, although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when Stanley Baldwin was the serving prime minister.\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively; this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are sometimes listed as prime ministers. Bath was invited to form a ministry by when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the affairs of government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days, and Waldegrave after three. Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister, and they are therefore listed separately.\nPrior to the Georgian era, the Treasury of England was led by the Lord High Treasurer. By the late Tudor period, the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the Great Officers of State, and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (Lord High Treasurer, 1547–1549), served as Lord Protector to his prepubescent nephew ; William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Lord High Treasurer, 1572–1598), was the dominant minister to; Burghley's son Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, succeeded his father as chief minister to (1598–1603) and was eventually appointed by as Lord High Treasurer (1608–1612).\n\nBy the late Stuart period, the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a commission of Lords of the Treasury, led by the First Lord of the Treasury. The last Lords High Treasurer, Lord Godolphin (1702–1710) and Lord Oxford (1711–1714), ran the government of Queen Anne.\n\nAfter the succession of in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent. For the next three years, the government was headed by Lord Townshend, who was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Subsequently, Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland ran the government jointly, with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic. Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later; Townshend and Robert Walpole were then invited to form the next government. From that point, the holder of the of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister. It was not until the Edwardian era that the title was constitutionally recognised. The prime minister still holds the office of First Lord by constitutional convention, the only exceptions being Lord Chatham (1766–1768) and Lord Salisbury (1885–1886, 1887–1892, 1895–1902).\n\nAs of , there are five living former British prime ministers. The most recent to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990), on 8 April 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

It lies near the center of Lighthouse Reef, a small atoll from the mainland and Belize City. The hole is circular in shape, across and deep. It was formed during several episodes of quaternary glaciation when sea levels were much lower. Analysis of stalactites found in the Great Blue Hole shows that formation took place 153,000; 66,000; 60,000; and 15,000 years ago. As the ocean began to rise again, the cave was flooded. The Great Blue Hole is a part of the larger Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a World Heritage Site of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThis site was made famous by Jacques Cousteau, who declared it one of the top five scuba diving sites in the world. In 1971 he brought his ship, the \"Calypso\", to the hole to chart its depths. Investigations by this expedition confirmed the hole's origin as typical karst limestone formations, formed before rises in sea level in at least four stages, leaving ledges at depths of , , and . Stalactites were retrieved from submerged caves, confirming their previous formation above sea level. Some of these stalactites were also off-vertical by 5˚ in a consistent orientation, indicating that there had also been some past geological shift and tilting of the underlying plateau, followed by a long period in the current plane. The tilt indicates that this was a movement of the land, rather than a rise in sea level alone.\n\nInitial measured depth of Great Blue Hole was which is the most often cited depth up to this day. An expedition by the Cambrian Foundation in 1997 measured the hole's depth as at its deepest point. This difference in measurement can be explained by ongoing sedimentation or by imprecision in measurements. The expedition's goal was to collect core samples from the Blue Hole's floor and document the cave system. To accomplish these tasks, all of the divers had to be certified in cave diving and mixed gases.\n\nIn December 2018, two submarines descended into the Blue Hole, in an attempt to map its interior. Using sonar scanning, the team was nearly able to complete a 3-D map of the 1,000 foot wide hole.\n\nThis is a popular spot among recreational scuba divers who are lured by the opportunity to dive in sometimes crystal-clear water and meet several species of fish, including midnight parrotfish, Caribbean reef shark, and other juvenile fish species. Other species of sharks, such as the bull shark and hammerheads, have been reported there, but are not regularly sighted. Usually, day trips to the Great Blue Hole are full-day trips from the coastal tourist communities in Belize.\n\nOn-shore caves of similar formation, as large collapsed sinkholes, are well known in Belize and in the Yucatán Peninsula, where they are known as \"cenotes\". Unlike the mainland cenotes which often link to underwater cave systems, there is little evidence of horizontal development in the Blue Hole.\n\nIn 2012 Discovery Channel ranked the Great Blue Hole as number one on its list of \"The 10 Most Amazing Places on Earth\". In 2018, they featured a two-hour special titled \"Discovery Live: Into the Blue Hole\" featuring Fabien Cousteau and Richard Branson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2152561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152561", "title": "Peter Stumpp", "text": "Peter Stumpp\n\nPeter Stumpp (died 1589) (whose name is also spelled as Peter Stube, Peter Stubbe, Peter Stübbe or Peter Stumpf) was a German farmer, accused of werewolfery, witchcraft and cannibalism. He was known as 'the Werewolf of Bedburg'.\n\nThe most comprehensive source on the case is a pamphlet of 16 pages published in London in 1590, the translation of a German print of which no copies have survived. The English pamphlet, of which two copies exist (one in the British Museum and one in the Lambeth Library), was rediscovered by occultist Montague Summers in 1920. It describes Stumpp's life, alleged crimes and the trial, and includes many statements from neighbours and witnesses of the crimes. Summers reprints the entire pamphlet, including a woodcut, on pages 253 to 259 of his work \"The Werewolf\".\n\nAdditional information is provided by the diaries of Hermann von Weinsberg, a Cologne alderman, and by a number of illustrated broadsheets, which were printed in southern Germany and were probably based on the German version of the London pamphlet. The original documents seem to have been lost during the wars of the centuries that followed.\n\nContemporary reference was made to the pamphlet by Edward Fairfax in his firsthand account of the alleged witch persecution of his own daughters in 1621.\n\nPeter Stumpp's name is also spelled as \"Peter Stube\", \"Peter Stub\", \"Peter Stubbe\", \"Peter Stübbe\" or \"Peter Stumpf\", and other aliases include such names as Abal Griswold, Abil Griswold, and Ubel Griswold. The name \"Stump\" or \"Stumpf\" may have been given him as a reference to the fact that his left hand had been cut off leaving only a stump, in German \"Stumpf\". \nIt was alleged that as the \"werewolf\" had its left forepaw cut off, then the same injury proved the guilt of the man. Stumpp was born at the village of Epprath near the country-town of Bedburg in the Electorate of Cologne. His actual date of birth is not known, as the local church registers were destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). He was a wealthy farmer of his rural community. During the 1580s, he seems to have been a widower with two children; a girl called Beele (Sybil), who seems to have been older than fifteen years old, and a son of an unknown age.\n\nDuring 1589, Stumpp had one of the most lurid and famous werewolf trials of history. After being stretched on a rack, and before further torture commenced, he confessed to having practiced black magic since he was twelve years old. He claimed that the Devil had given him a magical belt or girdle, which enabled him to metamorphose into \"the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and large, which in the night sparkled like fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body, and mighty paws.\" Removing the belt, he said, made him transform back to his human form. No such belt was ever found after his arrest.\n\nFor twenty-five years, Stumpp had allegedly been an \"insatiable bloodsucker\" who gorged on the flesh of goats, lambs, and sheep, as well as men, women, and children. Being threatened with torture he confessed to killing and eating fourteen children, two pregnant women, whose fetuses he ripped from their wombs and \"ate their hearts panting hot and raw,\" which he later described as \"dainty morsels.\" One of the fourteen children was his own son, whose brain he was reported to have devoured.\n\nNot only was Stumpp accused of being a serial murderer and cannibal, but also of having an incestuous relationship with his daughter, who was sentenced to die with him, and that he had coupled with a distant relative, which was also considered to be incestuous according to the law. In addition to this he confessed to having had intercourse with a succubus sent to him by the Devil.\n\nThe execution of Stumpp, on October 31, 1589, and of his daughter and mistress, is one of the most brutal on record: he was put to a wheel, where \"flesh was torn from his body\", in ten places, with red-hot pincers, followed by his arms and legs. Then his limbs were broken with the blunt side of an axehead to prevent him from returning from the grave, before he was beheaded and his body burned on a pyre. His daughter and mistress had already been flayed, strangled and were burned along with Stumpp's body. As a warning against similar behavior, local authorities erected a pole with the torture wheel and the figure of a wolf on it, and at the very top they placed Peter Stumpp's severed head.\n\nThere are a number of details of the text of the London pamphlet that are inconsistent with the historical facts.\n\nThe years during which Stumpp was supposed to have committed most of his crimes (1582–1589) were marked by internal warfare in the Electorate of Cologne after the abortive introduction of Protestantism by the former Archbishop Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg. He had been assisted by Adolf, Count of Neuenahr, who was also the lord of Bedburg.\n\nStumpp was most certainly a convert to Protestantism. The war brought the invasion of armies of either side, the assaults by marauding soldiers and eventually an epidemic of the plague.\n\nWhen the Protestants were defeated during 1587, Bedburg Castle became the headquarters of Catholic mercenaries commanded by the new lord of Bedburg—Werner, Count of Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck, who was a staunch Catholic determined to re-establish the Roman faith.\n\nSo it is not inconceivable that the werewolf trial was but a barely concealed political trial, with the help of which the new lord of Bedburg planned to bully the Protestants of the territory back into Catholicism. If it had been just another execution of an alleged werewolf and a couple of witches, as occurred about this time in various parts of Germany, the attendance of members of the aristocracy—perhaps including the new Archbishop and Elector of Cologne—would be surprising. Furthermore, the trial remained a singular event.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the charges were without basis in fact. The execution of a mere Protestant convert would have been deeply unlikely to have drawn the aristocratic attention Stumpp's trial did, and while it was unlikely for the elite to attend to any given werewolf or witch trial, the sheer scale of Stumpp's alleged crimes would have made it more visible to the public at large and the nobility.\n\nEnglish black metal band The Infernal Sea recorded a song called \"Skinwalker\" about the werewolf of Bedburg on their 2017 e.p Agents of Satan. \nThe U.S. metal band Macabre recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled \"The Werewolf of Bedburg\"; it can be found on the \"Murder Metal\" album.\n\nThe German horror punk band The Other recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled \"Werewolf of Bedburg\"; it can be found on the \"Casket Case\" album.\n\nIn the Pine Deep Trilogy of novelist and folklorist Jonathan Maberry, Peter Stumpp is the supernatural villain Ubel Griswold. Since Griswold is actually one of Stumpp's historical aliases, Maberry decided to use the name of Ubel Griswold instead of openly telling people that the villain was the infamous werewolf Peter Stumpp until later on in the third book of the series, \"Bad Moon Rising\".\n\nIn the Jim Butcher book \"Fool Moon\" there are several characters that use enchanted wolf pelt belts to transform into a wolf form, similar to the belt Peter Stumpp claimed to have.\n\nA reference to Peter Stumpp is also made in William Peter Blatty's book, \"The Exorcist\". When Father Karras and Kinderman talk about Satanism they say \"Terrible, was this theory, Father, or fact?\" \"Well, there's William Stumpf, for example. Or Peter. I can't remember. Anyway, a German in the sixteenth century who thought he was a werewolf\".\n\nThe direct-to-video \"Big Top Scooby-Doo!\", uses a portion of Lukas Mayer's woodcut of the execution of Stumpp in 1589, though in the movie no mention of Stumpp is made. The portion used depicts a man cutting off a werewolf's left paw (supposedly Stumpp in werewolf form) and a child being attacked by a werewolf. The woodcut scene shown in the film restores the werewolf's left paw and removes the child in the second werewolf's jaws, making it appear as if the swordsman is fighting one of the werewolves while another flees.\n\nIn the \"Doctor Who\" audio drama \"Loups-Garoux\", Pieter Stubbe was in fact a werewolf. He managed to escape before he was executed and lived for another five centuries. He was defeated by the Fifth Doctor in Brazil in 2080. It is implied that he ate both the Grand Duchess Anastasia and Lord Lucan.\n\nJournalist and fiction writer J.E. Reich partially based her short story \"The Werewolves of Anspach,\" on the life of Peter Stumpp.\n\nThe story of Peter Stumpp was also told in episode 3 of the podcast \"Lore\", released on April 6, 2015. In 2017, the podcast episode was adapted into the fifth episode of the TV series adaptation of \"Lore\", where he was played by Adam Goldberg.\n\nThe case inspired Neil MacKay's novel, 'The Wolf Trial' (Glasgow: Freight Books, 2016. )\n\nPeter Stumpp is referenced in 'The Werewolf of Bamburg' by Oliver Potzsch. It briefly mentions his execution and crimes.\n\nPeter Stumpp is referenced as a werewolf in \"The Secret Life of Cooper Bennett\" by Golden Czermak ()\n\n"}

Fink\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink (born November 2, 1952) is an American billionaire businessman. He is the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, an American multinational investment management corporation. BlackRock is the largest money-management firm in the world with more than $6.5 trillion in assets under management. In April 2018, Fink's net worth was $1 billion.\n\nFink was born on November 2, 1952. He grew up in a Jewish family in Van Nuys, California, where his mother was an English professor and his father owned a shoe store. He earned a BA in Political Science from UCLA in 1974. Fink is also a member of Kappa Beta Phi. He then received an MBA in Real Estate at the UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management in 1976.\n\nFink started his career in 1976 at First Boston, a New York-based investment bank. Eventually taking charge of First Boston's bond department, Fink was instrumental in the creation and development of the mortgage-backed security market in the United States. At First Boston, Fink was a member of the Management Committee, a Managing Director, and co-head of the Taxable Fixed Income Division; he also started the Financial Futures and Options Department, and headed the Mortgage and Real Estate Products Group.\n\nFink added as much as $1 billion to First Boston's bottom line. He was successful at the bank until 1986, when his department lost $100 million due to his incorrect prediction about interest rates. The experience influenced his decision to start a company that would invest clients' money while also incorporating comprehensive risk management.\n\nIn 1988, under the corporate umbrella of The Blackstone Group, Fink co-founded BlackRock and became its Director and CEO. When BlackRock split from Blackstone in 1994, Fink retained his positions, which he continued to hold after BlackRock became more independent in 1998. His other positions at the company have included Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Executive and Leadership Committees, Chair of Corporate Council, and Co-Chair of the Global Client committee. BlackRock went public in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Fink helped to negotiate the resignation of the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso, who was widely criticized for his $190 million pay package. In 2006 Fink led the merger with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, which doubled BlackRock's asset management portfolio. That same year, BlackRock's $5.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village, a Manhattan housing complex, became the largest residential-real-estate deal in U.S. history. When the project ended in default, BlackRock clients lost their money, including the California Pension and Retirement System, which lost about $500 million. \n\nThe U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help clean up after the financial meltdown of 2008. Although BlackRock is widely believed to have been the best choice for the cleanup job, Fink's longstanding relationships with senior government officials have led to questions about potential conflict of interest regarding government contracts awarded without competitive bidding.\n\nIn December 2009, BlackRock purchased Barclays Global Investors, at which point the company became the largest money-management firm in the world. Despite his great influence, Fink is not widely known publicly, apart from his regular appearances on CNBC. BlackRock paid Fink $23.6 million in 2010.<ref name=\"The Wall Street Journal/Hay Group Survey of CEO Compensation\"></ref> By 2016, BlackRock had $5 trillion under management, with 12,000 employees in 27 countries.\n\nIn 2016, Fink received the ABANA Achievement Award in New York City. It recognizes an individual who exemplifies outstanding leadership in banking and finance and has a commitment to positive professional cooperation between the US and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nIn 2018, Fink was ranked #28 on the \"Forbes\" list of The World's Most Powerful People.\n\nFink serves on the board of trustees of New York University, where he holds various chairmanships including chair of the Financial Affairs Committee. He also co-chairs the NYU Langone Medical Center board of trustees and is a trustee of the Boys and Girl's Club of New York. Fink is also on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation. Fink founded the Lori and Laurence Fink Center for Finance & Investments at UCLA Anderson in 2009, and currently serves as chairman of the board.\n\nIn December 2016, Fink joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.\n\nIn his 2018 annual open letter to CEOs, he called for corporations to play an active role in improving the environment, working to better their communities, and increasing the diversity of their workforces. This has been taken as evidence of a move by Blackrock, one of the largest public investors, to proactively enforce these targets. In his 2019 open letter Fink said that companies and their CEOs must step into a leadership vacuum to tackle social and political issues when governments fail to address these issues.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, Fink in October 2018 cancelled plans to attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn his 2020 annual open letter, Fink announced environmental sustainability as core goal for BlackRock's future investment decisions. In this letter, he explained how climate will become a driver in economics, affecting all aspects of the economy. He also divested in a separate letter (to investors) that BlackRock will be cutting ties with previous investments involving thermal coal and other investments that have a large environmental risk.\n\nFink has been married to his wife, Lori, since the mid-1970s. The couple own homes in Manhattan; North Salem, New York; and Vail, Colorado. The couple have three children. Joshua, their eldest son, was CEO of Enso Capital, a now defunct hedge fund in which Fink had a stake. Fink is a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn his 2018 annual letter to shareholders, Fink stated that other companies should be aware of their impact on society, however, anti-war organizations are discontent with Fink's statement, because his company, BlackRock, is the largest investor in weapon manufacturers through its U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF. In September 2018, an activist with the U.S. non-profit organization Code Pink confronted Fink on stage at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit.\n\n"}

{"id": "2152595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152595", "title": "Jonkheer", "text": "Jonkheer\n\nJonkheer (female equivalent: jonkvrouw; French: Écuyer) is an honorific in the Low Countries denoting the lowest rank within the nobility. In the Netherlands, this in general concerns a prefix used by the untitled nobility. In Belgium, this is the lowest title within the nobility system, recognised by the Court of Cassation. It is the cognate and equivalent of the German noble honorific Junker, which was historically used throughout the German-speaking part of Europe, and to some extent also within Scandinavia.\n\n\"Jonkheer\" or \"jonkvrouw\" is literally translated as \"young lord\" or \"young lady\". In the Middle Ages, such a person was a young and unmarried child of a high-ranking knight or nobleman. Many noble families could not support all their sons to become a knight, because of the expensive equipment. So the eldest son of a knight was a young lord, while his brothers remained as esquires.\n\nHowever, in the Low Countries (and other parts of continental Europe), only the head of most noble families carries a title, inheritance being by male lineage. As a result, most of the nobility is untitled in the Netherlands. 'Jonkheer', or its female equivalent 'jonkvrouw', developed therefore quite early into a different but general meaning: an honorific to show that someone does belong to the nobility but does not possess a title. The abbreviation \"jhr.\" (for men) or \"jkvr.\" (for women) is placed in front of the name, preceding academic but not state titles.\n\nThe honorific could be compared more or less with \"Edler\" in Austria or \"Junker\" in Germany, though due to circumstances of German and especially Prussian history, \"Junker\" assumed connotations of militarism absent from the Dutch equivalent. Ranking this with the English nobility, it is roughly comparable with \"The Honourable\" when the untitled person is a son or daughter of a baron, viscount, or the younger son of an earl; or \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" when the person belongs to the old untitled but high-ranking (Dutch) nobility from before 1815 (e.g. \"Heer van X\" or Lord of X).\n\nThe spouse of a jonkheer is not named jonkvrouw but \"Mevrouw\", translated into English as \"Madam\" and abbreviated as \"Mrs.\" (with the use of her husband's name). However, if she is a jonkvrouw in her own right, she can be styled as such (together with her maiden name), unless she chooses to use her husband's name.\n\n\"Jonkheer\" is, in Belgium, the lowest title and an official Dutch mark of status (not a title), as stated above, and is used as such, most notably by members of the Dutch royal family with the style Jonkheer van Amsberg.\n\nOften however a title of nobility may be claimed by a family whose members are officially recognised only as \"jonkheeren\", the title not being acknowledged by the modern monarchy either because the family is registered as untitled nobility and may thus only use the honorific or predicate, or because the family has not requested official registration of the title, but possesses a grant of nobility which predates the founding of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815.\n\nIn Belgium, a number of families may bear the hereditary title of \"Jonkheer\". Famous were Jonkvrouw Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz (Queen Mathilde of Belgium) and Delphine, Jonkvrouw Boël.\n\nThe coronet of rank for the untitled nobility in the Netherlands and Belgium is the same as that for the rank of a hereditary knight, i.e. \"Ridder\": a plain circlet of gold with eight golden points, each topped with a pearl; five of them are seen in a representation. Furthermore, the golden circlet of the heraldic coronet is surrounded with a pearl collar.\n\nUnrecognised titleholders use the same coronet of rank as hereditary knights, described above. Unrecognised titles cannot officially use a coronet of rank and thus use the coronet that they have been historically awarded, if any at all.\n\n\"Jonkheer's\" best-known use among English-speaking people is as the root of the name of the city of Yonkers, New York. The word was likely a nickname, as opposed to an honorific, associated with Adriaen van der Donck; a young Dutch lawmaker, pioneering politician and landowner in New Netherland. While his business ventures largely proved less than successful, the city of Yonkers takes its name from his steadfast work in the formation of the state of Manhattan itself.\n\nThe word, in reference to Van der Donck, is variously spelled among modern scholars. In Thomas F. O'Donnell's introduction to a translation of van der Donck's \"A Description of the New Netherland\", it is suggested that van der Donck was known as \"The Joncker\". Russell Shorto's \"The Island at the Center of the World\" has \"jonker\", while Edward Hagaman Hall's book on Philipse Manor Hall uses \"youncker\". \"\"Jonker\"\" (old Dutch spelling joncker) is another form of the word \"\"jonkheer\"\".\n\nJonker Street (Jonkerstraat) in Malacca, Malaysia, which derives its name from Dutch, can be traced back to when the Dutch ruled Malacca from 1641 to 1798.\n\n"}

In the 2012–2013 school year, White Station announced 23 National Merit Semifinalists.\n\nWhite Station High School has also had the most National Merit Scholarship semifinalists of any school in the state of Tennessee in many previous years.\n\nWhite Station has 7 National Board Certified teachers.\n\nIn January 2014, White Station High School announced that they would be offering the AP Capstone program in the 2014-2015 school year.\n\nClass sizes averaged 20.7 students per teacher at the time of these achievements; however, class size averages have increased to 27 students per teacher.\n\nWhite Station offers several foreign language options for students, including Spanish, Latin, Japanese, and French.\n\nWhite Station also has a girls basketball team, soccer teams (M/F), track and field teams (M/F), a football team, a bowling team (M/F), lacrosse teams (M/F), a golf team (M/F), a volleyball team (F), rugby teams (M/F), cross-country teams (M/F), ultimate teams (M/F), a swim team (Co-ed), a wrestling team (M), a baseball team (M), a softball team (F), a cheerleading team (F), and a tennis team (M/F). The Lady Spartans tennis team has won the city championship for 3 consecutive years, 2009-2011, and finished as state runner-up in 2009, 2010, and 2011. That team was led by Kayla Jones, Kasey Spillman, Maya Smith, and Lauren and London Thomas. The boys' tennis team won the 2011 district championship and advanced one player to the state championships. White Station's Lady Spartans volleyball team won the Memphis city championships in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The boys and girls Cross Country teams have won the Memphis city championship for 5 consecutive years. The Bowling Team won the city championship in 2014 and advanced to state.\n\nIn 2009, the Spartans won the Division 6A State Title, the highest football division in the state. In 2013 the Spartan football team made it to 6A state semifinals, a game they lost 49-41 to Hendersonville High School.\n\nWhite Station has many active clubs in areas including foreign language, mathematics, science, business, government, music, art, film and community service. Its Knowledge Bowl team has won four Knowledge Bowl championships in the past years, winning the first Knowledge Bowl ever in 1987–1988, and in 2014 – beating Houston in the final round. Its Mock Trial team won the Tennessee State Championship in 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n\nWhite Station's Science Olympiad team consistently places well in the state, placing 2nd in 2014, 2015, and 2018 while going to Nationals in 2017 and 2019. Their Model United Nations team is a completely student-run, ranked team in the Mid-South region as they attend various conferences such as VUMUN, WUMUNS, MUNI, WAVEMUN, and MSMUN, winning Best Large Delegation consistently. Additionally, they annually host a conference at White Station High in September, garnering attendance from various schools across the Mid-South. The Quiz Bowl team in White Station is another one of the major clubs. It is largely student-led. This club travels to surrounding areas and competes against other schools. Two tournaments are hosted by the Quiz Bowl Team each school year. Other activities include an elected student council, jazz ensemble, DECA, and HOSA club.\n\nStudents staff the school newspaper (\"The Scroll\"), the yearbook (\"The Shield\"), and an art and literary magazine (\"The Scribbler\").\n\nIn the performing arts, White Station has four bands and two orchestras, as well as five choirs and two a cappella pop groups. The four bands are as follows: Jazz Ensemble, Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, and Concert Band. There is a marching band that starts in July and goes on until December, depending on if the football team makes it to the playoffs for it plays on football games. The WSHS came second in a 2014 band competition. The orchestras have gained superior ratings at concert festival and also hold many of the positions in the All-West Tennessee band, orchestra, and choir, as well as spots in the Memphis Youth Symphony and All-State ensembles. White Station's choir program has performed at events such as the Tennessee Holocaust Day of Remembrance and the TMEA conference. In 2014, the White Station Men's Chorus was selected to perform at Southern division ACDA in Jacksonville, Florida. Each year, the choir program sends a substantial percentage of students to All-West and All-State.\n\nWhite Station has a theatre program, including troupe 1581 of the International Thespian Society. Students present a major performance each fall and spring, and the senior-level play production class produces an annual one-act play festival as well.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 2,569 students at White Station: 31% are Caucasian, 44% are African American, 9.1% are Asian or Pacific Islander and 11% are Hispanic.\n\nIn addition to students from the surrounding neighborhood and who travel from all over the city for the school's college preparatory program, White Station serves the family housing units of the University of Memphis at the Park Avenue Campus.\n\nWhite Station can trace its origins to a school organized just prior to the Civil War that initially shared a building with a Masonic Lodge. By 1897, the school, then known as Albert Pike High School, occupied the entire building and, with an enrollment of eighty students, was one of the largest schools in Shelby County. After World War I, the school was renamed White Station to honor Mr. Eppie White, who had donated three acres of land for the construction of a school building. The school served first through eighth grades during this time.\n\nAfter the White Station area was annexed to Memphis, the school became part of the Memphis City Schools during the 1950-1951 academic year. At that time, the Memphis City Board of Education foresaw the need for a separate junior and senior high school in the area to accommodate the growing population. Rush W. Siler, a mathematics teacher at East High School, was appointed as principal in 1951, and White Station began to develop a junior high. In August 1954, a high school building was completed, and the school began to develop a senior high school program. As such, White Station Middle School and White Station Elementary School were formed.\n\nAt this point, White Station High School needed a distinctive identity as a full-fledged Memphis high school. The original White Station mascot was a bulldog and the school newspaper was \"The Bulldog Leash\", with school colors of blue and white. However, these colors were already in use by Memphis Catholic High School. The first senior class of 1956-1957 chose \"Spartans\" as their mascot and green and gray as school colors. In keeping with the ancient Greek theme, the White Station newspaper was dubbed \"The Scroll\" and the yearbook became \"The Shield\".\n\nThe first high school class of seventy-eight seniors graduated on May 30, 1957.\n\nThe school began development on a new building in 2009, which is expected to be completed sometime in 2011, at which time an older building will be torn down. The Freshman Academy was completed in the summer of 2011 and the old South Annex was torn down in response. A new parking lot was created. As of 2014, a grant was received to update the cafeteria and the picnic tables in the courtyard.\n\nIn November 2009, the school system in which White Station is included won a grant of $90 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The gift of more than $90 million from Gates is supposed to fund plans to improve teacher effectiveness, including raising the bar for tenure and paying $6,000 incentives for high-quality new teachers who stay at least four years. Due to political corruption and instability, however, very little of that grant has been seen by White Station or any other local schools.\n\n\n"}

As it became clear that the mob wanted a new emperor, Probus fled the city and Hypatius and Pompeius took shelter in the Imperial Palace, along with Justinian and the rest of the Byzantine Senate. They did not wish to rebel against Justinian, fearing they would have too little popular support.\n\nNevertheless, Justinian, fearing treachery, expelled the Senate from the Palace, thus ushering the two brothers into the mob's arms. Hypatius was dragged away from his house, despite the efforts of his wife to prevent this, and was proclaimed emperor by the rioting mob at the Hippodrome. Hypatius seems to have thereafter overcome his initial reluctance, and began to play up to the part of emperor.\n\nHowever, the riots were soon successfully (if bloodily) quelled by the Imperial Guard, and Hypatius was captured by Justinian's men. Justinian is reported to have wanted to spare Hypatius's life, but his wife Theodora prevailed upon him to see the punishment meted out, and the involuntary usurper was executed.\n\n\n"}

In this way, it is possible to develop fully two-dimensional or three-dimensional CFD or computational fluid dynamics codes that are able to capture fairly realistic geometries.\n\nThe development of codes like COSILAB is motivated by a worldwide attempt to keep the environment clean and to save—or at least make best use of—the continuously diminishing fossil fuel resources.\n\n"}
{"id": "2152620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152620", "title": "KFWB", "text": "KFWB\n\nKFWB (980 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Los Angeles, California. It airs a classic Regional Mexican music format. KFWB is owned by Lotus Communications. The station has a colorful history, being the radio voice of Warner Bros. Studios in the early days of broadcasting, and a long-time Group W/CBS all-news radio station from 1968 to 2009. It has kept the same call sign throughout its nearly 100-year history.\n\nKFWB is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format. KFWB broadcasts with 5,000 watts of power from a non-directional antenna shared with KLAC on North Indiana Avenue near Lincoln Park in Eastside Los Angeles. The studios and offices are on Barham Boulevard, near the Universal City complex.\n\nOn March 3, 1925, KFWB first signed on the air, initially on the frequency of 950 kHz. The station was started by Sam Warner, a co-founder of Warner Bros.. The station launched the careers of such stars as Ronald Reagan, Alan Ladd and Bing Crosby during the \"Golden Age of Radio.\" The station was the first to broadcast the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena.\n\nAlthough some think its call letters stand for Keep Filming Warner Brothers or K Four Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner), the call sign was sequentially issued by the Department of Commerce, predecessor to the FCC. The station got its call sign just after KFWA in Ogden, Utah, and KFWC in San Bernardino, both granted in February 1925. Nevertheless, Warner Bros. Animation regularly used KFWB as a running gag in its productions.\n\nOn February 8, 1937, KFWB opened a new facility on the south end of the Warner Bros. lot. It included six large studios, one of which was a 500-seat theater, and a \"multi-manual pipe organ, built especially for broadcasting.\"\n\n\"Bedtime for Sniffles\", a 1940 Merrie Melodies cartoon, produced by Warner Bros., and directed by Chuck Jones, has Sniffles the mouse trying to stay awake for Santa Claus, and a radio announcer signs off for the night identifying the station as KFWB. Another cartoon of the same year, \"The Timid Toreador\", co-directed by Bob Clampett, shows an announcer broadcasting on this station, although the action takes place in Mexico. The Merrie Melodies cartoon for \"I've Got A Torch Song\" released in conjunction with \"Gold Diggers of 1933\" has KFWB written on the microphones in the scenes of the torch singers.\n\nIn 1932, a KFWB personality, Al Jarvis, began playing recorded music, a rarity on radio at the time, where music was usually performed live. He called his show \"The World's Largest Make Believe Ballroom.\" In 1946, KFWB brought in two disc jockeys from New York City: Maurice Hart of WNEW, whose morning drive time show \"Start the Day Right\" was described as \"Words and Music Straight from the Hart,\" and Martin Block, who shortened Jarvis' title to \"The Make-Believe Ballroom.\" In those days, the DJs selected their own music, either from KFWB's extensive record library, or new songs brought to them by \"song pluggers.\" Old and new, vocal and instrumental were mixed together to the disc jockey's choice. \n\nIn 1950, KFWB was sold to its long-time general manager, Harry Maizlish. It soon moved its studios off the Warner Bros. lot to join Maizlish's FM station, KFMV (now KTWV), on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nIn 1958, the original \"Seven Swingin’ Gentlemen\" (a nickname for the DJ staff) turned KFWB into a rock & roll powerhouse in Los Angeles. Under new owners Crowell-Collier Broadcasting, program director Chuck Blore pioneered the Top 40 format on AM 980, calling it \"Channel 98 Color Radio\". KFWB became one of the most listened-to stations in the Southland and a leader in the Top 40 format around the country. The air staff during the glory days included Roger Christian (songwriter), Bill Ballance, B. Mitchel Reed, Bruce Hayes, Al Jarvis, Joe Yocam, Elliot Field, Ted Quillin and Gene Weed. Hourly updates were delivered by a staff of respected newscasters, including Cleve Herrmann, Charles Arlington, John Babcock, Beach Rogers, Mike Henry, Hal Goodwin, Al Wiman, Bill Angel, J. Paul Huddleston and Jackson King. \n\nIn the mid-1960s, KFWB was overtaken by rival KRLA. Then KRLA was put in second place by the launch of \"Boss Radio\" at KHJ, and this relegated KFWB to the position of the third-place Top 40 music station in the L.A. market.\n\nIn 1966, KFWB was purchased by Westinghouse Broadcasting. The previous year, Westinghouse had successfully launched an all-news radio format on WINS in New York City, after that station had been playing Top 40 music. On March 11, 1968, KFWB ended its Top 40 era, and was relaunched as an all-news radio station. The station promoted itself with the slogan, \"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\", as first used by WINS, although KFWB's format used a 30-minute news cycle. Like WINS and co-owned KYW Philadelphia, KFWB had a running Teletype sound effect in the background during regular newscasts.\n\nAlso in Spring 1968, another Los Angeles radio station jumped into the all-news format, KNX, owned by CBS Radio. For the next 27 years, the two stations would be competitors, airing television commercials and sponsoring billboards, in an effort to be LA's top radio news outlet.\n\nIn 1995, Westinghouse bought the CBS Corporation, merging the broadcast operations of the two companies, with KFWB coming under the ownership of CBS Radio. For the first several years after their parent companies merged, KFWB and KNX continued to operate separately, as friendly rivals.\n\nIn addition to being an all-news station, KFWB also had sports play-by-play contracts. It previously aired Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games and many National Football League games from Westwood One. The NFL broadcasts stopped after the 2007 Pro Bowl, later switching to AM 790 KABC. With that, the slogan \"all news, all the time\" returned. However, in 2008, the NFL broadcasts returned for a brief period.\n\nBeginning in 2008, KNX and KFWB were jointly branded as \"CBSNewsRadioLA.\" The CBSNewsRadioLA brand was used for simulcasting special programs and for marketing to advertisers. In addition, there were no longer separate field reporters for KNX and KFWB. CBSNewsRadioLA reporters filed stories for both stations.\n\nAlso in the 2009 season, KFWB began broadcasting some weekday baseball games of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, although the flagship station remained the Angels-owned KLAA. On August 13, 2009, CBS announced the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers had signed a multi-year broadcast rights pact, with KFWB carrying every Clippers contest.\n\nOver time, KFWB's ratings gradually dropped. A number of factors may have been involved. KFWB is powered at 5,000 watts, while KNX is powered at 50,000 watts. In its final months as an all-news station, KFWB added more news about the movie and television industries, since many people in the Los Angeles market are employed in those fields. But the ratings continued to fall.\n\nOn September 8, 2009, the station adopted a news-talk format, limiting the all-news blocks to AM and PM drive times. The station added nationally syndicated shows, including Dave Ramsey, Laura Ingraham, Michael Smerconish and Dr. Laura Schlessinger (who moved from longtime flagship KFI). In 2011, Dr. Laura's show was dropped when she moved from broadcast radio to Sirius XM Satellite Radio. Dave Ramsey shifted to 11am-2pm and the station added motivational speaker Les Brown to its afternoon lineup. Brown left the station in 2012. Ramsey's show was discontinued in 2014. By the summer of 2014, KFWB's weekday line-up included: LA's Morning News with Penny Griego and Phil Hulett; Money 101 with Bob McCormick; \"As We See It\" with Phil Hulett and friends; LA's Afternoon News with Maggie McKay and Michael Shappee; and The Amani & Eytan Show from NBC Sports Radio.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the station was authorized by the FCC to boost its power to 50,000 watts, using a directional antenna involving multiple towers. But the power increase was short-lived. A few years later, new owners returned to KFWB's original 5,000 watt output, so the station could broadcast from a single non-directional antenna and take up less acreage of valuable Los Angeles real estate.\n\nOn November 2, 2011, CBS Radio placed KFWB into a trust headed by Diane Sutter, under the name \"The KFWB Asset Trust.\" This was due to CBS Corp.'s ownership limitations after the network bought KCAL-TV in 2002.\n\nOn September 22, 2014, KFWB became a CBS Sports Radio Network affiliate, cancelling all news blocks and general interest talk programs. The station began calling itself \"The Beast 980.\"\n\nThe Beast 980 featured a live and local morning show, \"The Home Team\", hosted by Bill Plaschke and Jeanne Zelasko. The Beast 980’s weekday lineup also featured Jim Rome and Fred Roggin. Sports updates were provided during the day mostly by Sam Farber, Amy Bender and Ted Sobel, with Hall-of-Fame USC Trojans broadcaster Pete Arbogast providing sports updates and as a fill-in host from time to time. The Beast 980 was the flagship radio station of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the LA Galaxy soccer team of the MLS. The Beast 980 also carried NFL games, NCAA college football games and NCAA basketball games.\n\nOn January 5, 2016, it was reported that KFWB was in the process of being sold to an operator of foreign-language radio stations. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission stated that the station would be acquired by Principle Broadcasting, a company backed by Mercury Capital Partners, for $15 million. The final price in the contract filed with the FCC was $8 million. \n\nAs a result of the sale, the station's sports format was discontinued on March 1, 2016. After one day of continuous airings of a five-minute retrospective of KFWB, the station began carrying the full service South Asian Bollywood music format which also was airing on KKDZ in Seattle and KLOK in San Jose. KFWB called itself \"Desi 980\". On March 16, 2016, the Los Angeles Clippers entered into a multi-year deal making KLAC the team's new flagship station, removing the games from KFWB.\n\nOn October 4, 2016, Lotus Communications agreed to purchase KFWB from Universal Media Access for $11.2 million. The sale was finalized on March 7, 2017. Lotus owns 34 stations in California, Nevada and Arizona, including three in Southern California: Farsi-language KIRN in Simi Valley, ESPN Deportes affiliate KWKW in Los Angeles, and its simulcast partner, KTMZ in Pomona. On October 31, 2016, KFWB switched to a regional Mexican music format as \"La Mera Mera 980\" (\"The Best of the Best\"). In 2018, the station has been named the official radio station for calling MLS's Los Angeles FC matches.\n\nMusicians\nNews Anchors\nReporters\nTraffic anchors\nSports anchors\nOthers\n\nThe original KFWB studios and transmitter location were at the Warner Bros. Studios, which is now KTLA, at 5800 Sunset Boulevard. One of the two original towers still stands prominently out front. Due to RF interference getting into the movie studio's \"talkies\" sound equipment, the transmitter was moved in 1928 to the roof of the Warner Theater, now the Hollywood Pacific Theatre, at 6423 Hollywood Blvd. Eventually the studios were also moved to the Warner Theater. Those two towers are still standing. \n\nYears later, when KFWB was sold to KFWB Broadcasting Co. (Harry Maizlish), the studios moved to 6419 Hollywood Blvd. (now demolished), and the transmitter moved to a site near La Cienega and Rodeo Blvd., about three blocks south of the KECA/KABC studio/transmitter site. To make way for the construction of a FEDCO membership department store, in July 1958 the transmitter moved to its present location, diplexed with 570 KLAC in East LA. The studios moved in 1977 to 6230 Yucca St., also in Hollywood. \n\nIn June 2005, KFWB moved into new studios on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district, sharing facilities with Entercom's other L.A. stations, KNX, KTWV and KRTH. Today, the studios and offices are on Barham Boulevard, near the Universal City complex.\n\n"}

His mother had wanted a girl and was very displeased that she had another son instead. She would also constantly subject him to emotional and physical abuse. As a child, Brudos and his family would move into different homes in the Pacific Northwest, before settling in Salem, Oregon.\n\nBrudos had a fetish for women's shoes from the age of 5, after playing with stiletto heeled shoes at a local junkyard. He reportedly attempted to steal the shoes of his first grade teacher. Brudos also had a fetish for women's underwear and claimed that he would steal underwear from female neighbors as a child. He spent his teen years in and out of psychotherapy and psychiatric hospitals.\n\nIn his teenaged years, Brudos began to stalk local women, knocking them down or choking them unconscious, and fleeing with their shoes. At age 17, he abducted and beat a young woman, threatening to stab her if she did not follow his sexual demands. Shortly after being arrested, he was taken to a psychiatric ward of Oregon State Hospital for nine months. There it was found Brudos's sexual fantasies revolved around his hatred towards his mother and women in general. He underwent a psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite being institutionalized, Brudos graduated from high school with his class in 1957. Shortly after graduation, he became an electronics technician.\n\nIn 1961, Brudos married a 17-year-old girl with whom he would father two children, and settled in a Salem suburb. He asked his new bride to do housework naked except for a pair of high heels while he took pictures. It was at about this time that he began complaining of migraine headaches and \"blackouts,\" relieving his symptoms with night-prowling raids to steal shoes and lace undergarments. Brudos would experience a transgender period, where he used the female persona as a form of escape mechanism. Brudos kept the shoes, underwear, and (for a time) the bodies of his victims in a garage that he would not allow his wife to enter without first announcing her arrival on an intercom that he had set up.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1969, Brudos bludgeoned and strangled four young women and attempted to attack two others:\n\n\nBrudos would dress up in high heels and masturbate after committing a murder. In May 1969, a fisherman found the bodies of Salee and Sprinker in the Long Tom River. The police asked students at a nearby university campus about suspicious men and one led them to Brudos, who had phoned her several times to ask her for a date. Brudos gave police a false address, which increased their suspicions. At his garage, the police found copper wire that was determined to have been cut with the same tool that cut the cords used to tie the bodies. Brudos was arrested and he made a full confession.\n\nOn June 28, 1969, Brudos pled guilty to three first-degree murders (Sprinker, Whitney and Salee) and was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment in Oregon State Penitentiary. Though he confessed to Slawson's murder, Brudos was neither tried nor convicted for it because he did not make and keep photographs of the body, unlike in the other cases, but only of her foot. Whitney's body was found a month after Brudos' conviction, about a mile downstream from where he said he had thrown it.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Brudos had piles of women's shoe catalogues in his cell—he wrote to major companies asking for them—and claimed they were his substitute for pornography. He lodged countless appeals, including one in which he alleged that a photograph taken of him with one of his victim's corpses could not prove his guilt, because it was not the body of a person he was convicted of killing. In 1995, the parole board told Brudos that he would never be released.\n\nBrudos died in prison on March 28, 2006 from liver cancer. At the time of his death, he was the longest incarcerated inmate in the Oregon Department of Corrections (a total of 37 years, from 1969 to 2006).\n\n\n"}

My philosophy is to train my hardest, do my best and be happy with the outcome. I am not afraid of getting hurt and will fight anyone that they want to put in front of me at any time. I am not saying that to sound like a tough guy but the reality is that they (the K1 office) use their infinite wisdom to do their job in booking the fights and I need to do my job.\" When asked in the same article about how he got into wrestling and fighting in Japan, Howard explained: \"I was doing pro wrestling in Japan on television for several years with a promotion called Zero-One – The back story to this explains my introduction to K1: Zero One was an offshoot company of New Japan Pro Wrestling established by Shinya Hashimoto. Hashimoto was looking for a new Gaijin (foreign) wrestler to introduce, so I was brought over to wrestle him on a big pay per view called Shingeki. This was when Japanese Pro Wrestling was mimicking MMA so we wore MMA gloves and the matches had MMA rules. I guess the match was highly regarded because we made the covers of the wrestling magazines and even mainstream sports papers. After that I started to get a following in Japan and spent the next several years going back and forth between Japan and the USA for monthly tours. At the end of one of my annual contracts I received word from my manager and friend Rick Bassman that K1 was interested in signing me to a multi year/fight deal and everything just worked out from there. As I said before, I was a huge fan of K1 and had been following it heavily with all of the time I was spending in Japan.\"\n\nHe made his K1 MMA debut against France's Kristof Midoux on New Year's Eve at K-1 PREMIUM 2003 Dynamite!!. He then fought Mongolian Wrestling champion Dolgorsürengiin Serjbüdee (aka \"Blue Wolf\") at K-1 MMA ROMANEX in May 2004. This bout was particularly brutal with Howard being kneed in the head and face a total of 46 times. It was after this fight that K1 changed their MMA rules to make throwing knees to the head of a grounded opponent illegal. In his next K1 MMA fight, Howard fought against American kickboxer and K1 US Champion Carter Williams in Hawaii at Rumble on the Rock 6. This fight ended when Williams threw a fury of punches on the ground causing cuts that required Howard to receive a total of 36 stitches. In June 2005, Howard fought in Hiroshima, Japan on the K1 Grand Prixs show under kickboxing rules against 7' 2\", 400 lb. South Korean Choi Hong-man. This fight was featured in K1's Best Knockouts as Choi caught Howard with a knee to the Head causing a 6\" cut up his forehead and knocking him halfway across the ring. In August 2006, Tom Howard was recruited by the Antonio Inoki's Tokyo Sabres to fight in the International Fight League. His premier fight with the promotion came on September 6, 2006 against Krzysztof Soszynski. In February 2007, Howard competed in the Cage Rage Championships at Wembley Arena in London, England against Wolfslaire fighter Tom Blackledge. This fight ended quickly when Howard escaped from a takedown attempt and turned into a headkick by Blackledge causing a 5\" cut which ended the fight and required 8 staples to close. In December 2007, Howard fought Eric \"Butterbean\" Esch in the main event of the World Cage Championship in Jasper, Alabama.\n\n\n\nHoward has had various roles in film, television and other media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) https://web.archive.org/web/20110929005702/http://board.deathvalleydriver.com/lofiversion/index.php/t7341.html Tom Howard interview on Maxfighting\n\n2) https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233150/http://www.thefightpros.com/index.html Pro Wrestling and Fighting services to the Film & Television Industries\n\n"}

The station airs an Adult Top 40 radio format which the station describes as \"Today's Modern Hit Music\". KZZU-FM is owned by Morgan Murphy Media, with the license held by QueenB Radio.\n\nKZZU-FM has studios and offices with other Morgan Murphy stations on West Boone Avenue in Spokane. The transmitter is also in Spokane, off South Krell Ridge Lane, on Krell Hill, also known as \"Tower Mountain.\" Programming is also heard on translator station K223AN at 92.5 MHz in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.\n\nIn September 1955, the station signed on as KREM-FM, the first FM station in Spokane. KREM-FM was co-owned with AM 970 KREM (now KTTO). KREM had been founded by Cole E. Wylie in 1946 and operated as a 250-watt station in Spokane. In a 1977 interview with radio broadcaster historian Richard Dunning, KREM was described as the \"first non-network, independent, all music station\" in Spokane. KREM had also put a television station on the air in 1954, a year before KREM-FM signed on. KREM-TV carried ABC and DuMont Television Network programming at first, but today is a CBS Network affiliate.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, when few people owned FM radios, KREM-FM simulcast the AM station's programming. In 1958, KREM-AM-FM-TV were acquired by the Seattle-based King Broadcasting Company. Under King Broadcasting ownership, KREM-AM-FM became a Top 40 station, vying with KJRB for Spokane's young radio listeners. KREM-FM switched to a progressive rock format in the late 1960s, while the AM continued its Top 40 format. Around 1980, KREM-FM moved to a more structured album-oriented rock format, with a playlist of the top tracks from the best selling rock LPs.\n\nIn 1984, the radio stations were sold to Highsmith Broadcasting, while King Broadcasting kept KREM-TV. At the time, different stations could not share the same call sign if they had different owners, with the AM becoming KLHT (due to its \"light music\" soft adult contemporary format), while the FM station became KZZU-FM.\n\nThe station called itself \"KZZU The Zoo\" and \"93 Zoo FM\", spearheaded by Program Director Bill Stairs. The Top 40 format once heard on the AM station was switched to the FM station, complete with a \"morning zoo\". The \"93 Zoo FM Breakfast Boys' Morning Show\" (first hosted by Jim Arnold and Craig Johnson, then Arnold and Dave Sposito, then later with Sposito and Ken Hopkins) played the top hits and discussed pop culture. Popular KZZU DJs at the time included Jamie Patrick, Casey Christopher, Sean Rivers, Devin James, Steve Hawk, Paul Gray, Rachel Brooks, Doug Inman and Jeffrey Parker.\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, KZZU aired a mainstream top 40 format. As the 1990s went on, the format shifted toward a more rhythmic contemporary direction with a slight focus on Hip Hop artists from the inland Northwest. In the early 2000s, changing tastes towards rock music and increased competition caused KZZU to move more towards a rock-leaning Top 40 as hip hop music fell to the lower end of its playlist. In its last year as \"93 Zoo FM\", the station was noted in having an all-female DJ line up with the exception of Rick Dees and Hollywood Hamilton on Sundays. The rock leaning focus lead to some talk of a format adjustment.\n\nOn October 17, 2005, KZZU dropped the \"Zoo FM\" moniker in favor of \"92.9 ZZU\", and shifted to Adult Top 40 in order to more effectively compete with KCDA. The new format left Spokane without a mainstream top 40 outlet for five years. The new format initially leaned alternative as KZZU removed all the hip hop from its playlist. Core artists included The Killers, Audioslave, Switchfoot and Green Day. Co-owned \"Wired 96.9 KEZE\" became Spokane's station for hip hop, R&B and rhythmic pop and dance product. KZZU's new format reunited the Breakfast Boys with Molly Allen, although the station stopped using \"The Breakfast Boys\" moniker. Dave, Ken, Molly and producer Dan Roberts host the station's morning show, targeting an 18 to 49 year old demographic.\n\nIn 2008, after the change of sister station KEZE from Rhythmic Top 40 to Country, KZZU somewhat returned to its CHR roots by adding some rhythmic music during the evening hours while maintaining the Adult Top 40 format during the daytime. \n\nIn 2011, KEZE dropped AAA (who adopted the format from KXLY-FM the year prior as part of a format swap) and returned to Rhythmic Contemporary music as \"Hot 96.9.\" The format flip on 96.9 resulted in KZZU dropping most rhythmic music to avoid overlapping with KEZE, though it would retain some rhythmic tracks. For a time, Mediabase and Nielsen BDS described KZZU as a Hot AC outlet. KZZU was reclassified as Adult Top 40 it when Mapleton Communications-owned KZBD dropped alternative rock for CHR, becoming \"105.7 Now FM.\"\n\n\n"}

This means that strong security can be obtained using weak passwords.\n\nPassword-authenticated key agreement generally encompasses methods such as:\n\n\nIn the most stringent password-only security models, there is no requirement for the user of the method to remember any secret or public data other than the password.\n\nPassword authenticated key exchange (PAKE) is where two or more parties, based only on their knowledge of a password, establish a cryptographic key using an exchange of messages, such that an unauthorized party (one who controls the communication channel but does not possess the password) cannot participate in the method and is constrained as much as possible from brute force guessing the password. (The optimal case yields exactly one guess per run exchange.) Two forms of PAKE are Balanced and Augmented methods.\n\nBalanced PAKE allows parties that use the same password to negotiate and authenticate a shared key. Examples of these are:\n\nAugmented PAKE is a variation applicable to client/server scenarios, in which the server does not store password-equivalent data. This means that an attacker that stole the server data still cannot masquerade as the client unless they first perform a brute force search for the password. Examples include:\n\n\nPassword-authenticated key retrieval is a process in which a client obtains a static key in a password-based negotiation with a server that knows data associated with the password, such as the Ford and Kaliski methods. In the most stringent setting, one party uses only a password in conjunction with N (two or more) servers to retrieve a static key. This is completed in a way that protects the password (and key) even if N-1 of the servers are completely compromised.\n\nThe first successful password-authenticated key agreement methods were Encrypted Key Exchange methods described by Steven M. Bellovin and Michael Merritt in 1992. Although several of the first methods were flawed, the surviving and enhanced forms of EKE effectively amplify a shared password into a shared key, which can then be used for encryption and/or message authentication.\nThe first provably-secure PAKE protocols were given in work by M. Bellare, D. Pointcheval, and P. Rogaway (Eurocrypt 2000) and V. Boyko, P. MacKenzie, and S. Patel (Eurocrypt 2000). These protocols were proven secure in the so-called random oracle model (or even stronger variants), and the first protocols proven secure under standard assumptions were those of O. Goldreich and Y. Lindell (Crypto 2001) which serves as a plausibility proof but is not efficient, and J. Katz, R. Ostrovsky, and M. Yung (Eurocrypt 2001) which is practical.\n\nThe first password-authenticated key retrieval methods were described by Ford and Kaliski in 2000.\n\nA considerable number of alternative, secure PAKE protocols were given in work by M. Bellare, D. Pointcheval, and P. Rogaway,variations, and security proofs have been proposed in this growing class of password-authenticated key agreement methods. Current standards for these methods include IETF RFC 2945, RFC 5054, RFC 5931, RFC 5998, RFC 6124, RFC 6617, RFC 6628 and RFC 6631, IEEE Std 1363.2-2008, ITU-T X.1035 and ISO-IEC 11770-4:2006.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152683", "title": "James Edward Pough", "text": "James Edward Pough\n\nJames Edward \"Pop\" Pough (February 16, 1948 – June 18, 1990) was an American spree killer, who, on June 18, 1990, killed nine people and wounded four others in a GMAC (now Ally Financial) car loan office in Jacksonville, Florida, before committing suicide. The day before, he had killed an innocent woman and man on Jacksonville’s Northside, he wounded two teenagers, and robbed a convenience store.\n\nThe shooting at the GMAC office was the deadliest mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in Florida history, surpassing the murder of eight machine shop employees in Hialeah by Carl Robert Brown on August 20, 1982.\n\nPough, who was born on February 16, 1948, in Jacksonville, Florida and was the first of nine children, grew up in an area near Florida Community College at Jacksonville. As a child, Pough suffered from asthma and he had a close relationship to his mother, whom he helped out a lot after his father left the family in 1959. He attended a vocational school, but dropped out in his sophomore year. At the age of 18, he began working as a common laborer, which he stayed as until his death.\n\nDuring the last year of his life, he was doing construction maintenance at a brewery.\n\nAccording to former schoolmates, Pough had affiliations with gangs during his time at school. He was arrested twice in 1965 for vagrancy, and twice again in 1966, once for attempted robbery and a second time for assault after he attacked a construction worker who owed him a quarter. In 1968, Pough was arrested for dangerously displaying a knife and was fined $75, and in July 1969, he was fined $10 after being charged for gambling. In 1970, he was arrested, but not prosecuted, for motor vehicle theft and vagrancy-prowling by auto.\n\nOn May 8, 1971, Pough got into an argument with his best friend, David Lee Pender, who had called his girlfriend a \"bitch\". In the following scuffle, Pough grabbed a .38-caliber revolver from his girlfriend's purse and shot Pender three times; he eventually died in a hospital. According to relatives, he never managed to get over the fact that he had killed his friend.\n\nPough was initially charged with murder, though the charge was later reduced to manslaughter. In the end, he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to five years probation, but the judgment of his guilt was withheld by the court subject to the successful completion of probation.\n\nDue to Pough's violent behavior in the past, it was also ruled that he should never be allowed to own a gun, though this was never forwarded to police. As a result, Pough was not considered a felon and therefore was able to purchase several handguns, among them the Röhm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver he later used to commit suicide, which was registered with the police on June 4, 1979. In 1977, Pough appeared twice in court for charges of bad debt, and there was also an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a 1982 employment compensation fraud case.\n\nIn December 1988, Pough traded his old car for a 1988 Pontiac Grand Am, though he soon had difficulties to make his payments. As a result, the car was voluntarily repossessed by GMAC in January 1990. He received a bill for $6,394 of outstanding fees in March, and again on April 6, which was the last contact between him and the office. About two months prior to the shootings, Pough purchased a M1 carbine at a local pawnshop.\n\nPough, who was living in a rundown duplex in Jacksonville's Northwest Quadrant at the time, was known by his neighbors as a quiet and nice man who kept a regular and fixed schedule, but also as someone who would become angry fairly quickly and get engaged in enraged conversations, especially in matters concerning money and his car. Relatives described him as a recluse with no friends.\n\nAfter the death of his mother three years prior to the shootings, Pough was said to have emotionally changed for the worse, saying that he had nothing left to live for and arguing that he would \"take someone with him when he leaves this world\". Frequently, he had violent outbursts, which were directed against his wife, Theresa, and twice he threatened her by putting a gun to her head. In January 1990, they separated, as Mrs. Pough feared for her safety, and on March 2, she was granted an injunction that disallowed Pough to get in contact with her for a year. As a consequence, he withdrew even more and rarely socialized.\n\nPough started his killing spree in the night of June 17 at about 12:50 a.m. Armed with his M1 Carbine, which was wrapped in a blanket, he walked up to a group of men standing at a street corner in the northwest section of Jacksonville, not far from his home, and killed Louis Carl Bacon, with two shots in the chest before leaving. A couple of minutes later, he attacked Doretta Drake, who was chatting with two other women in a vacant parking lot just two blocks from the first crime scene. After hitting Drake with his car, throwing her on the sidewalk, Pough stepped out of his Buick and killed her with a single shot to the head, again from the M1, before driving away.\n\nA short time later, Pough also shot and wounded two youths, 17 and 18 years of age, after asking them for directions. Later, on the morning of June 18, Pough entered a convenience store, threatened the clerk with a pistol and, stating that he didn't have anything to lose, demanded all of the money in the register. After getting the money, he left.\n\nAfter robbing the convenience store, he visited his mother's grave one last time, and then called his supervisor to state that he wouldn't be coming to work because he had something else to do. At about 10:44 a.m., Pough parked his car at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation office located at 7870 Baymeadows Way in Jacksonville. He entered the building through the front door, armed with his M1 Carbine, a Röhm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver, several loaded magazines, and ammunition packed in his pockets. Then, without saying a word, he immediately began shooting with the M1 Carbine at two customers at the front counter, killing Julia Burgess and wounding David Hendrix with four shots. Walking through the open office, he then systematically moved from desk to desk and shot at the GMAC workers, deliberately aiming at those hiding under their desks.\n\nDrew Woods was the first to be shot at his desk, followed by Cynthia Perry and Barbara Holland nearby, as well as Phyllis Griggs, who was injured. When the GMAC employees realized what was going on, many of them escaped through a back door of the building, while Pough started shooting at those ducking for cover. GMAC employees Janice David, Sharon Hall, Jewell Belote, Lee Simonton, Denise Highfill, Ron Echevarria, and Nancy Dill were also shot. He then put the .38-caliber revolver to his head and committed suicide. In just about two minutes, Pough had fired at least 28 rounds from his carbine, hitting 11 of the 85 workers in the office, as well as the two customers. Six of his victims died at the scene, while another three died at hospital, the last being Jewell Belote, who succumbed to her wounds nine days after the shooting.\n\nWhen searching Pough's car, police recovered a loaded 9mm semi-automatic machine pistol, two magazines, and ammunition, as well as twelve pieces of nylon rope, each having a length of 24 inches, which led police to the assumption that Pough initially might have intended to take hostages. When police arrived at Pough's home, it had been ransacked, although they found a calendar with two dates circled in red: May 8, the day he killed his friend Pender, and June 18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This force consists of air, land, sea and special forces elements, and is highly integrated with its first and second line reserves, as well as supporting civilian agencies and paramilitary forces. \n\nThe mission of the National Guard is to take all necessary measures for the defense of the Republic of Cyprus for the purpose of dealing with a threatened invasion or any action directed against the independence or territorial integrity of the Republic or threatening to secure the life or property of citizens of the Republic.\n\nGreece currently maintains a garrison in the Republic of Cyprus under the designation Hellenic Force in Cyprus (ELDYK), but this is not officially part of the Cyprus military and primarily serves as a regimental-level influence for training and support of the National Guard. The northern part of the island remains occupied by the Turkish military since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.\n\nThe National Guard was established in 1964 as a force composed predominantly of ethnic Greeks, following the Cyprus crisis of 1963–1964 and the breakdown of social and political relations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on the island of Cyprus. As outlined by the tripartite Treaty of Alliance (1960) and defined by the early Constitution of 1960–1963, Cyprus was entitled to an army of 2,000 men, to be made up of 60% Greek and 40% Turkish personnel. The first elected President of the Republic of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios III, proposed thirteen constitutional amendments to the 1960 constitution, which would have adjusted distribution of manpower and voting power for all civil and military services. This adjustment was aimed at giving greater representation and influence to the Greek Cypriot majority, which at the time formed around 82% of the island's indigenous population.\n\nThe Cypriot National Guard has been involved in multiple combat operations, all within Cyprus territory.\n\n\nMilitary service in the Republic of Cyprus is mandatory for males (Efthymiou 2016). Today, the obligatory service period is 14 months. Currently, only Greek Cypriots serve in the military. Legally, the Greek Cypriot community comprises the ethnic Greek population as well as Cypriots belonging to three Christian minorities—the Armenians, Latin Rite Catholics and Maronites. Since 2008, service is mandatory for all members of the Greek Cypriot community and not only for ethnic Greek Cypriots. The current supreme commander is a Greek military commander, as have been all of his predecessors. All male visitors to the island of military age (16 and over) who have a father of Cypriot extraction are required to obtain an exit visa from a Defence Ministry office.The Cyprus National Guard has since 2016 aimed to move towards semi-professionalization (Efthymiou, S. 2016). In the scope of this change, the military serviced time was reduced from 24 months to 14 months, whilst about 3, 000 professional soldiers were hired. Even though long wished by the public, these changes have been said to be no more than a political expediency. The way in which the semi-professionalization has been conducted has been illustrated as unprofessional and undermining the ability of the force, by academic researchers.\nEurope's defence is present in Cyprus through PESCO. The government had argued for it to increase deterrence against any intervention on the island. Cyprus has made available the military base in Paphos and the naval base in Zygi, along with other facilities. These have been upgraded and equipped with electronic surveillance systems.\n\nThe force has in recent years, experienced exponential draft dodging (in Greek: φυγοστρατία). Much policy has been designed, yet the phenomenon has not been managed (Efthymiou, 2019).\nThe National Guard is an interdisciplinary force. It consists of the Army, Navy and Air Force as mentioned above. The General Staff of the National Guard is the supreme hierarchical step and includes the Chief, the Staff, the Arms / Body Divisions and Organizations and its Organizational Units. \n\nThe force heavily relies on the Reserves (Εφεδρεία), making up the biggest percentage of Human Resources in the case of full mobilisation of the National Guard. \n\nArmy- It consists of a number of Infantry Regiment Brigade Brigade Formations and Regular Regimental Groups:\nNavy- It consists of:\n\n\nAir Force- It consists of:\n\n\nThe Cypriot National Guard, in its existent form, was initially mobilised circa mid-1963 as a Greek Cypriot infantry force with some small elements dedicated to artillery, anti-armour and light armour forces. This force inherited some mixed equipment from its pre-civil war organisation, including 54 British-made 25-pounder gun-howitzers, 40 Marmon-Herrington Armoured Car (Mk. IVF), 4 Shorland light armoured cars, 2 Daimler Dingo light armoured cars, 5 C-17 light armoured trucks and a variety of machine guns, mortars and a few anti-tank weapons (namely M20 Super Bazookas and a small number of PIAT weapons). The Greek Cypriots also possessed some Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns, along with a variety of Bedford trucks and old US made jeeps.\n\nThe military confrontation at Kokkina in August 1964 between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot forces saw the Greek-Cypriot force mobilised for the first time to attempt to eliminate a fortified coastal enclave in the Tylliria region of the island, in an effort to stop Turkish vessels putting ashore there to offload food, weapons and ammunition for the Turkish Cypriot militia units active in that region. The attempted siege of Kokkina began on 6 August and ended on 9 August after two days of daylight air strikes by the Turkish Air Force around Kokkina and neighbouring Kato Pyrgos (a mountain village overlooking Kokkina which was being used for observation and artillery fire-direction positions). Having sustained manpower and material losses as a result of these air strikes, the Cypriot National Guard pulled back slightly and solidified a perimeter of containment around Kokkina, leaving the Turkish Cypriot village isolated from the rest of the island, and buffered only a narrow UN demilitarized zone.\n\nAware of the glaring deficiency of their military capabilities, the leadership of the Cypriot National Guard under General George Grivas (an ultra-nationalist commanding officer largely subordinate to the Greek Junta in Athens) was able to compel the civilian Government of Cyprus, under Archbishop Makarios to seek out foreign assistance for a massive armament campaign. Since Cyprus could not afford major weapons purchases under her own depleted national budget, Makarios was forced to dispatch an envoy on 1 October 1964 to the Soviet Union to request military assistance. This move resulted in rapid Soviet assistance, widely regarded by Western countries as a step towards a Cold War alliance between Cyprus and Russia.\n\nAs soon as 23–24 December 1964, a Russian Navy freighter arrived at Limassol Port carrying the first batch of arms intended to re-equip the National Guard. These supplies included 4 unidentified armoured vehicles, and 130 ZIL heavy trucks, along with sufficient number of crates to fill 36 Bedford trucks. After this initial delivery, arms transfers made by the Russian Navy to Cyprus accelerated, with freighters travelling via Alexandria in Egypt to Limassol under cover of night. These deliveries included a full package of Soviet-made radars and radio systems to complement the structural and strategic requirements of a reinforced National Guard. In addition, a consignment of 32 Soviet-made T-34/85 medium tanks (from Yugoslav surplus) were delivered along with 40 BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, as well as a batch of 30 M-1944 100mm light field howitzers, 40 modern 3M6 Shmel anti-tank missile firing units, a batch of ZPU-1 14.5mm anti-aircraft guns and a consignment of around 4500 Czech surplus AK-47s, as well as machine guns and mortars.\n\nAfter 1965, and until 1974, the civilian Government of Archbishop Makarios became increasingly alienated by the relationship between the National Guard leadership and the ruling military Government of Greece. Few funds were made available to secure other armaments of technical support, and the National Guard was forced to develop alternative means to armament and self-sustainment. A Technical Corps was established to produce and retrofit a series of improvised armoured vehicles from unneeded ATS-712 Soviet tractors, resulting in 10 locally produced \"TS\" armoured personnel carriers. A lack of spare parts meant that by the time of the 1974 military coup against Archbishop Makarios, the National Guard was experiencing severe technical difficulties with its T-34 tanks. The problem for the National Guard was further compounded by the refusal of Makarios' loyalist paramilitary force to hand over some 4500 Czech automatic rifles and a variety of other weapons which had been kept at a warehouse near Nicosia Airport, and which were handed over to the UN in January 1972.\n\nOn 15 July 1974, the Cypriot National Guard, under its own leadership and in conjunction with the EOKA-B ultra-nationalist organisation, overthrew the civilian Government of Archbishop Makarios in Nicosia and attempted to assassinate him by using tanks and infantry to storm the Presidential Palace. Makarios escaped, but the confrontation in Nicosia resulted in multiple casualties as the National Guard units engaged in a gunfight with Makarios' loyalist forces. Since Kyrenia in the north of the island was not expected to present much armed resistance to the coup, many forces which were stationed there to fend off a threatened Turkish invasion were sent to Nicosia on 15 and 16 July to enforce the coup in the Capital. Kyrenia was thus, poorly defended when the Turkish invasion began on 20 July.\n\nOn 20 July 1974, Turkey commenced an air and sea invasion of northern Cyprus, under the codename \"Attila-1\" which had the anticipated aim of seizing Kyrenia as a beachhead with amphibious forces, whilst simultaneously establishing a beachhead from Kyrenia to the northern suburbs of Nicosia (the site of two Turkish fortified enclaves that could be used as strongholds to seize northern Nicosia) using parachute forces. The attack was heavily supported by a daylight air campaign, allowing Cypriot A/A flak to be suppressed to the extent that Turkish transport planes could drop parachute forces north of Nicosia in broad daylight from 20 July to 23 July. In disarray, the Greek Cypriot military leadership enacted the \"Aphrodite-2\" defence plan to coordinate a containment and resistance to the invasion forces. This plan, however, proved to be ineffective in either containing or repelling the Turkish forces already ashore. At the same time, the Greek Cypriot EOKA-B forces, subordinate to their own de facto leadership, enacted their own interpretation of the existing Aphrodite defence plan (sometimes referred to historically as Aphrodite-3 or Hephaestus) and attacked multiple Turkish Cypriot enclaves simultaneously, causing heavy Turkish Cypriot non-combatant casualties and rounding up an estimated 20,000 Turkish Cypriot POWs who were interred at Limassol until later that year.\n\nImmediately following the 1974 conflict, the Cypriot National Guard experienced a major depletion of its military capability due to lack of equipment and ammunition, compounded by the wartime economic collapse of the country. A small armored unit of 11 surviving T-34/85 tanks continued to operate in service until circa 1985, albeit in poor mechanical condition with lack of spare parts. Small numbers of other armored vehicles (including re-engined Marmon Herrington Mk-IV F armored cars) and artillery guns from the pre-war period also continued in service until the economic revival of the Cyprus Republic in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Cyprus sought new suppliers of arms in order to circumvent US and European embargoes, combined with an apparent unwillingness by the Soviet Union to supply further aid. From Brazil, a large consignment of new light armored vehicles was ordered in 1982, 15 EE-3 Jararaca armored reconnaissance vehicles (delivered 1984–1985), and 126 EE-9 Cascavel armored fighting vehicles (delivered 1984–1988).\n\nFaced with an urgent need for infantry-portable air-defense equipment, the Cypriot Government was able to procure 20 firing units of Strela-2/ SA-7B Grail anti-aircraft missiles along with 324 live rounds from neighboring Syria in 1984.\n\nMajor arms orders were also placed with France, one of the few European powers still willing to support weapon deliveries to Cyprus. In 1984, Cyprus purchased from France a total of 27 VAB-VCI infantry fighting vehicles with 20mm cannon (delivered 1985–1988) along with 100 VAB-VTT armored personnel carriers (delivered 1985–1988).\n\nIn 1987, the first batch of new French tanks were purchased to replace the T-34s that had been removed from service - a total of 15 AMX-30B2 main battle tanks and 1 AMX-30D recovery vehicle, all delivered the following year. Also in 1987, Cyprus purchased from France a unit of 6 SA-342L Gazelle scout anti-tank helicopters and 18 VAB-VCAC guided-missile tank-destroyers, along with 1200 HOT-2 anti-tank missiles (interchangeable for both airborne and ground launcher platforms), all delivered in 1988. A further 2 VAB-VTT armored personnel carriers were ordered as options in 1987 (delivered in 1988) along with 250 MILAN-2 anti-tank missile rounds and an unknown number of firing units (possibly 45).\n\nIn 1989, the Cyprus Government ordered a batch of 35 AMX-30B2 main battle tanks and 1 AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle as part of a $115 million US dollar purchase from France. The deal included 12 GIAT Mk F-3 self-propelled 155mm howitzers and 12 AMX-VCI armored personnel carriers. All of the equipment ordered from France in this year was delivered from 1990–1991.\n\nIn 1990, Greece supplied Cyprus with 81 ELVO Leonidas-2 (4K-7FA) armored personnel carriers, which were fielded to provide the Greek ELDYK Army Regiment in Cyprus with a Mechanized Infantry vehicle force. These were followed in 1996–1998 by a batch of 52 French-made AMX-30B main battle tanks supplied from Hellenic Army surplus, along with a further 65 new Leonidas-2 armored personnel carriers delivered in 1996–1997.\n\nIn late 2018, the Cyprus Government purchased 24 Nora B-52 self-propelled 155mm heavy field howitzers from Serbia, along with 8 BOV M16 Milosh MRAPs / Light Armoured Vehicles and an unspecified number of options to purchase additional systems for both types. The acquisition of Nora B-52 was widely reported to be part of a phased refurbishment of the Artillery Command, transitioning to a greater number of self-propelled guns and launcher systems, integrated and better networked for a more sophisticated war fighting capability.\n\nIn early 2020, Cyprus signed contracts worth more than 240 million Euros to purchase French Mistral MANPADS, Exocet ASMs and a short-medium range SAM system.\n\nThe Cyprus Naval Command became active circa 1963, following the outbreak of civil conflict between extremists within the Greek and Turkish ethnic communities of the island. At the outset of operational status, the Cyprus Naval Command was manned by Greek Navy officers and junior officers, whilst the sailors were primarily Greek Cypriot conscripts of educated backgrounds. The first equipment made available to the Cyprus Naval Command was a set of three ex-German WW2-era R-boats (two of the R-151 class called P-01 Arion and P-02 Phaethon, and one of the R-218 class under the name Dedalos). All three vessels were in service by August 1964, having been purchased from a shipyard in Piraeus, Greece by a private sponsor named A. Leventis. The three vessels were in poor condition due to their age, and had to be refurbished in Greece before delivery to Cyprus.\n\nOn 6 August 1964, the Cypriot National Guard was mobilised to intervene in the ongoing inter-ethnic confrontation at Kokkina, a Turkish-Cypriot controlled fortified enclave on the south-western edge of Morphou Bay in the north-west of the island. By this stage, the Cypriot National Guard was effectively a Greek Cypriot security force, which by virtue of its commander, General George Grivas, was subordinate to Athens (in Greece) and not to Nicosia (in Cyprus).\n\nKokkina was regarded by Grivas as a major coastal beachhead for Turkey to land weapons in Cyprus, with the aim of arming the Turkish Cypriots. For this reason, he persuaded the military government in Athens to authorise an all-out assault on Kokkina, with the aim of eliminating the beachhead, and preventing more weapons being delivered to Turkish Cypriot militia groups.\n\nAs a necessity of mounting such an assault, Grivas required a naval presence off the coast of Kokkina, in order to bombard the enclave from the sea, and to prevent any other shipping from interfering. Consequently, the Phaethon and the Arion were utilised in the assault and commenced their assault with broadsides of 40mm and 20mm gunfire into the enclave on 6 August. This action was coordinated with battery fire from six land-based 25-pounder guns and around a dozen mortars used by ground forces to besiege the enclave from the south and south-west.\n\nThe siege continued until 8 August, when the Turkish Government opted to intervene with air strikes, as it became clear to all parties that Kokkina's defences were likely to collapse, regardless of a UN presence in the area. The Turkish Air Force dispatched a number of formations of F-100 Super Sabres to commence air strikes against the Cypriot ground and naval forces, in broad daylight and flying at low level.\n\nThe first formation of F-100 Super Sabres spotted the Phaethon near to a small fisheries harbour west of Kokkina. The Phaethon commenced evasive manoeuvres and put up 20mm cannon fire, but was struck in the engines by strafing rockets and exploded into flames, killing seven of her crew. One of the four survivors then piloted the ship with a single functioning engine to run aground next to the harbour, so that the crew could be recovered by local fishermen. The Phaethon was then gutted by flames, rendering it a wreck.\n\nMinutes after the attack on the Phaethon, a second formation of F-100s spotted the Cypriot gunboat Arion further up the coast towards Kokkina. The Arion was strafed with guns and rockets, causing superficial damage. As the Arion successfully made her escape using evasive manoeuvres, an F-100C Super Sabre, piloted by Cpt. Cengiz Topel of 112 Filo was shot down by a Cypriot 40mm anti-aircraft gun emplacement on the shoreline.\n\nThe loss of the Phaethon was a severe shock to the National Guard leadership, and was compounded by further casualties and material losses at Kato Pyrgos, a nearby Greek Cypriot village which was bombarded on 8 and 9 August in an effort to dislodge National Guardsmen using its hilltops for directing artillery fire with radios.\n\nA scramble for arms featured prominently throughout 1964, as the Cypriot National Guard compelled the civilian Government to solicit Soviet support. In early 1964, the Greek Cypriots acquired a large package of radars, communications and logistical support apparatus for SA-2F Guideline surface-air missiles, and only a NATO blockade of Limassol in 1965 prevented the live missile rounds and their TELs from being delivered. With no effective air-defence measure in place, the Greek Cypriots utilised the radars at one western and one eastern coastal mountain points in the Pentadaktylos Mountains stretching across the north of the island. These radars provided both air and surface tracking capability for aircraft and shipping.\n\nIn late 1964, it was reported that Greek Cypriot Naval crews had been sent to Egypt to train on Soviet Komar class fast attack craft. Western media sources assumed that Cyprus was being prepared to receive Komar class vessels, although Cyprus eventually chose cheaper naval vessels in the form of six P-4 Skinhead motor torpedo boats (MTBs).\n\nIn February 1965, the Cyprus Naval Command entered the six MTBs into service under the naval pennants 20 to 25, and the designations T-1, -2, -3, -4, -5 and -6. These vessels were extremely fast and could be used to attack Turkish warships and landing vessels in littoral waters using a pair of 533mm torpedoes. In addition, each vessel mounted a twin 25mm general-purpose A/A gun. These were all stationed at a purpose-built naval squadron base at Boghazi, named Base Chrysulis.\n\nIn 1970, the P-01 Arion was renamed \"Leventis\" in honour of a private sponsor who paid for the refurbishment of the vessel. The Leventis was given the new pennant \"15\". Her sister ship, P-03 Dedalos, was removed from the Navy list in 1971.\n\nAt some point in 1973, the T-5 motor torpedo boat (No.24) was removed from Navy lists and disarmed. She was stripped of useful materials, and left as a hulk at Naval Base Chrysulis. Around the same time, three Type-108 motor torpedo boats of unknown designation were delivered from Yugoslavia, but did not enter active service and were laid up at Boghazi.\n\nJust prior to the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in 1974, the Cyprus Government ordered two Esterel-32L fast patrol boats from France. These were embargoed as a result of the conflict, and would be delivered to Greece instead in 1975.\n\nOn 15 July 1974, EOKA-B and elements of the Cyprus National Guard loyal to the Greek military junta overthrew President Archbishop Makarios and replaced him with Nikos Sampson. Makarios escaped an initial attempt to capture him at the Archbishopric in Nicosia, and fled to Paphos. The naval patrol vessel Leventis (No.15) was quickly dispatched to Paphos to begin shelling a radio station there which was being operated by pro-Makarios elements.\nOn 20 July 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus in a surprise-attack, without issuing a declaration of war. A naval force of Turkish vessels was detected by coastal radar at Apostolos Andreas approaching the coast, and a second force of naval vessels was sighted off the coast of Kyrenia during the early hours. The Cyprus National Guard Naval Command quickly ordered its two motor torpedo boats, T-1 (under the command of Lieutenant Junior Grade Nicolaos Verikios) and T-3 (under the command of Lieutenant Elefterios Tsomakis), both based at Kyrenia, to attack the Turkish flotilla directly. Both vessels were promptly sunk by combined air and sea attack. The rest of the Cyprus Navy vessels were scuttled by their own crews at Naval base \"Chrysulis\" in Boghazi on 14 August 1974. After the conflict, two boats were re-floated by Turkish troops and transferred to Golcuk Naval Museum, Turkey (on display with incorrect pennant numbers 11 and 12).\n\nIn February 2017, the Cyprus Navy was given an offshore patrol vessel by the Sultanate of Oman. The Al Mabrukah training and patrol vessel displaced 930 tons and was 62 metres long, making it far larger than any vessel previously operated by the Cyprus Navy. The vessel was refitted and modernised for the donation process, and came equipped with a large helicopter pad and expanded accommodation facilities, making it suitable for use as a support ship under its new designation, A620 Alasia. However the low speed of the ship, combined with its age, highlighted mechanical difficulties with the ship's propulsion, and following its use in the TELES-2017 naval exercise in May 2017, the ship was laid up at Larnaca Port, requiring repair. \n\nIn 2018, the Cyprus Navy received a Sa’ar 62. The P-61 has the capability to bring state-of-the-art surveillance and labelling systems for marine, ground and aerial targets. It was purchased by the Republic of Cyprus through a transnational agreement with Israel and was built by the Israeli shipyards in Haifa. The new vessel has a displacement of 430 tons, an overall length of 62 meters, a maximum speed of 32 knots, and carries up to 30 crewmembers plus a Special Forces unit. Installed on the vessel are multiple sophisticated systems including 2 Rafael Typhoon Weapon Stations with a single 23mm gun each, advanced radar, two TOPLITE electro-optical payloads, SATCOM, navigation systems, command and control systems, and more. Among others, the vessel is armed with two 12.7mm heavy machine guns but also it is Fitted for But Not With (FFBNW) a Rafael MLS-NLOS system. In late 2018, an option was exercised to purchase a second vessel of the type.\n\nIn June 1987, the Cyprus National Guard Air Command purchased a batch of six Aerospatiale SA-342L Gazelle scout anti-tank helicopters with 1200 Euromissile HOT-2 wire-guided anti-tank missiles (the interchangeable live rounds to be shared with the Army for use on their VAB-VCAC tank destroyers). The six aircraft were delivered from January 1988 onward, and were issued the serial numbers 351, 352, 353, 354, 355 and 356, drawn from Aerospatiale 21XX and 22XX series construction numbers. Of these aircraft, five examples (excluding 351) have been noted in regular use with the Cyprus National Guard airborne forces, suggesting number 351 had been withdrawn for use as spare parts, or as a technical training air frame, prior to 2004. The Gazelles were delivered in a three-tone desert camouflage consisting of light sand, dark sand and drab-olive tones - this camouflage has been retained to the present day. All aircraft utilize a low-visibility Cyprus flag fin-flash and a low-visibility Hellenic Air Force styled roundel marking at the midsection of the tail boom. The designation SA-342L is inscribed above the fin flash, along with the three-digit serial number.\n\nIn 2001–2002, Cyprus discreetly acquired 12 new-build examples (serial numbers 811–822 inclusively) of the Mil Mi-35P Hind-F attack helicopter type from the Russian Federation, following a lengthy tender process which included reported competition from the Mil Mi-28 Havoc, and Denel Rooivalk. The helicopters were first made public at a surprise three-ship flypast of the funeral of Lt General Evangelos Florakis on 12 July 2002 (himself killed in the crash of Cypriot Air Command Bell-206L Long Ranger \"112\" on 10 July 2002 whilst observing a command and control exercise at night). The Mi-35s were initially supplied in an unusual matt-black (and presumably infra-red absorbent) camouflage suitable for night operations, but lacked the optional FLIR turret and identification friend-or-foe systems made available for the more advanced Russian Mi-24PN. Aside from their monotone camouflage, the aircraft carried a small, high-contrast Cyprus Republic tail fin flag, and a high visibility Hellenic Air Force styled blue-on-white roundel on the tail at the midpoint. Bright red danger markings were applied to the rotor tips and to the end of the tail boom.\n\nThe Cypriot Mi-35 helicopters were initially equipped for the deployment of fixed-mount 30mm heavy cannon, and a capacity for 80mm (3.1 inch) S-8 rockets in AP and HE-FRAG configurations, as well as for anti-tank missiles in the 9K114 and 9M120 versions.\n\nOn 10 September 2005, National Guard Pilatus PC-9M turboprop aircraft \"902\" crashed into a church bell tower while performing an unauthorized flight maneuver near Kollossi in Limassol Cyprus, having deviated 80 km from the planned flight path. The aircraft was destroyed, and its two pilots killed.\n\nOn 5 July 2006, a National Guard Mi-35P Hind attack helicopter (serial number 822) crashed near the Paphos-Limassol motorway shortly after departing from Andreas Papandreou Air Base in Paphos. The aircraft was written off and both crew members (a Russian instructor and Cypriot student) killed.\n\nThe SA-342L Gazelle anti-tank helicopter force remains in service to present day, although example 356 is no longer thought to be operational. The four remaining Gazelle anti-tank helicopters are thought to have undergone an overhaul, reportedly completed in August 2014 at Valence-Chabeuil airport by Aerotec Group. The four Gazelle helicopters were assigned to 450ME / 1st Platoon, which has been implemented at Andreas Papandreou Air Base (in Paphos district) following the closure of Lakatamia air base (in Nicosia district) in April 2013. Their prior host unit, 449MAE Helicopter Squadron, was disbanded with the closure of Lakatamia AB.\n\nOn 28 November 2017 the Cypriot Defence Ministry announced the planned acquisition of eight helicopters, four SA-342L Gazelle scout anti-tank helicopters, to be acquired from France with night and all-weather capability, and four attack helicopters to be selected by tender. The four existing Gazelle helicopters in the Air Force would be upgraded, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were also being sought as part of a combined Unmanned Air System package.\n\nThe Cyprus armed forces operate a pool of three Army Special Forces Groups (plus one auxiliary) known colloquially as LOK (Greek: ΛΟΚ - Λόχοι Ορεινών Καταδρομών, Lochoi Oreinōn Katadromōn). All LOK Groups are part of the Army Special Forces Command DKD (Greek: ΔΚΔ - Διοίκησης Καταδρομών - Diikisis Katadromon), and a soldier belonging to the Brigade is called a Raider (Greek: Kαταδρομέας, Kαταδρομείς - Katadromeas, Katadromeis). Cyprus Special Forces training is based closely on their Greek Counterparts. The formation is more commonly referred to as the Raider Forces (Greek: Δυνάμεις Kαταδρομών, \"Dynameis Katadromon\").\n\nRoles include Airborne Operations (TEO), Unconventional Warfare, Reconnaissance, Guerilla Warfare.\n\nAll members of the Brigade wear the unit insignia depicting a winged sword, representative of the \"deadly, silent and swift\" nature of special forces operations. A scroll runs across the sword and wings with the motto Who Dares Wins ( - \"O Tolmon Nika\"), a tribute to the Free Greek Special Forces that served with the 1st Special Air Service (1 SAS) Brigade during World War II. The unit flash is emblazoned with ΔΥΝΑΜΕΙΣ ΚΑΤΑΔΡΟΜΩΝ (Raider Forces). While on operation, low-visibility patches are worn.\n\nAll Raiders wear the green beret with the Greek national emblem on the left.\n\nThe Navy has a Special Forces Group known as OYK Omada Ypovrixion Katastrofon (). Similar to US Underwater Demolition Team, which \"OYK\" stands for in Greek. Roles include amongst others Amphibious Assault and combating events of terrorism occurring at the EEZ of Cyprus.\n\nLand component\n\n\n"}

The virgin North American beech (\"Fagus grandifolia\") and sugar maple (\"Acer saccharum\") forest has specimens tall and with girths greater than in diameter. The remaining area in the park consists of floodplain oak-hickory forest. Because of the size and age of the trees, and the rarity of the ecosystem, the area has been designated since 1967 as a National Natural Landmark. Many of the beeches, with their smooth, thin, silver-grey bark, are heavily scarred by hand-carved graffiti, some of it decades old; however, the practice seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years.\n\nThe park has few facilities and is administered by nearby Warren Dunes State Park. Most visitors come to walk the of hiking trails, which run from the northern boundary on Warren Woods Road to a parking area accessed from the southern boundary on Elm Valley Road. In the middle of the park the trail crosses the Galien River on a pedestrian bridge, where there is an interpretive station. The park contains the Warren Woods Ecological Field Station owned and operated by the University of Chicago. Birders cite the park as a particularly good place to spot pileated woodpeckers. Other visitors come to picnic. The park is the subject of ecological studies because, in combination with the ecosystems preserved in nearby Warren Dunes State Park, it completes a progression of ecological seres.\n\n"}

The coup is usually performed by an individual or a small group usually from within the corporation in order to seize power. \nA Boardroom coup draws upon the ideas of a coup d'état in the same way that a corrupt, dysfunctional or unpopular group is pushed out of power.\n\nIn 1940 the television company Paramount, in an attempt to strengthen their business, took control of fellow rivals DuMont after failed attempts to work with other established companies in their field, including CBS, RCA and AT&T. Preceding these failures Paramount decided to obtain stocks in another television company, DuMont. After their purchase Allen DuMont, the owner of DuMont television, began to see his powers within the company flagging as Paramount now owned a large proportion of his company. Paramount with its newfound power proceeded to appoint its own directors amongst DuMont's. The company established their coup by giving crucial financial positions to those they had hired, stopping DuMont from having any financial input into the company and effectively becoming their owners.\n\nAfter the death of his youngest daughter in a freak car accident late in 1974, aging Anheuser–Busch CEO Gussie Busch, who had already become unusually wary of spending company money on new projects, was so consumed with grief as to be impossible to work with. In May 1975, his oldest son August Busch III put into action a plan he had been working on with executives close to him for several years, and persuaded the board to replace his father with him. Busch was allowed to retain some of his company perks and continue running the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team, which the company owned, but only if he represented his departure from the company leadership as voluntary. Only after his death in 1989 was it made public that it had not been.\n\nIn 1985 Steve Jobs was stripped of his title as Apple’s chief visionary after a boardroom meeting in which Apple's representatives sided with then-CEO Sculley. Despite the success of a new advertising campaign release in 1984, there was significant backlog of unsold stock, which was worth millions in revenue. Demand for the products dropped significantly between 1984 and 1985, leading to rising tensions between the CEO and Jobs. In an attempt to raise confidence in the company and his own ability, he launched a new computer, the Turbo Mac. His new piece of technology featured a multitude of different features from previous Mac models including a faster operating system, customised internal parts exclusively for the Turbo and the ability to store data from within. The project however was unsuccessful due to problems in the physical technology of the system. After this failure and no sign of improvement in profits at the corporation, a boardroom meeting was set up to decide Apple's and, unknowingly to him, Jobs's future as well. No concrete solutions were made and a few months later, in 1985, Jobs and Sculley had a showdown. Sculley ousted his rival, diminished his former title and forced Jobs to leave the company.\n\nAfter Jobs's removal, Apple had been faltering in its market position once again and was being overtaken by the other technological powerhouses. Sculley, in an attempt to save the company, began a search for a buyer. A multitude of companies were offered the corporation, but none accepted. In 1996 Gil Amelio took over the helm at Apple, and with the bad publicity the corporation was receiving, Amelio struggled in reinstating any hope for the future. He was fighting a losing battle for Apple and was considered by many to be worsening its struggle for survival. In June 1997 a meeting was set up with senior board members of Apple. The executives intended to discuss, exactly as it was nearly 10 years earlier, the state of the company and of Amelio. However, this time a clear decision was reached and a couple of weeks later Woolard, a member of the Board of Directors, delivered the news to Amelio by telephone that he would no longer be the head of Apple. Jobs, who had been busy after his resignation with his new company NeXT Inc., was reinstated as interim CEO after Apple bought his business in 1996 and was formally restored to the board in July 1997, just days after Amelio was ousted.\n\nIn 1990 Robert Stempel was appointed to CEO of General Motors, a company that he had worked for since 1962. He had started in their Oldsmobile Division and gradually climbed the various ranks of the company until he was given the position. An economic recession hit the globe in the late 1980s and into the early 1990s which significantly impacted on GM and the automotive industry in general. The pressure to keep the company profitable came upon Stempel. He, alongside the board of directors, looked for ways to cut costs in every division. Particularly, they looked to restructure the make-up of the company so that it would bear the brunt of the recession less forcefully than his rivals. However, in 1992 the board took action against Stempel. With a vote the managing directors, as well as external directors, fired him. They believed that he was not only responsible for the level of GM's losses, but they also accused him of doing little to return the company to the success they expected.\n\nIn May 2013 an attempt was made to threaten the position of the club's chairman Malcolm Murray. The club had gone into liquidation a year before but after an agreement was reached and the club was re-purchased, their prospects began to improve and confidence amongst shareholders was raised. Despite a prosperous looking future, in May a group of these shareholders decided that they wanted Murray removed as well as other senior members of the board. Fans and investors alike were uncertain of the exact financial state of the club because little information had been released since their liquidation. Because of this, tensions rose between the board and shareholders, despite directors trying to assure investors that the club was financially secure. The shareholders, who owned 6.1% of the business then successfully managed to oust Murray of his position and employ Walter Smith - a previous manager of the club whom was appointed in his place.\n\nIn 2012 an attempt was made by Robin Chan to completely overhaul Blackberry in an attempt to save them. Chan was not an employee of Blackberry, instead a technological entrepreneur who set up his own business, the XPD Media Inc group. After Blackberry's share prices plummeted to $16 in 2012 Chan began to plan a takeover over the company with a team of specialists in finance and technology. His aim was to save the fledgling company from having to be sold out or going bankrupt. He created a slideshow, which he named Project BBX to present to the board. Within the slides there were details of Blackberry's current losses in a number of graphs and how he envisaged, with his team, to turn the company around. Some of the changes included completely overhauling Blackberry's operating system and ensuring the phone's security system was the best available to buy. In the end the board's opposition to major changes coupled with his lack of funding due to the size of his project meant Chan was never able to succeed in Project BBX and his boardroom coup failed.\n\n"}

He was born in Kirk Ports, North Berwick, East Lothian, Scotland.\n\nMcLeod's mother was from Bolton in East Lothian and his father Neil was from the Isle of Skye. His father was employed as the manager of a temperance book stall and also worked as a caddie. McLeod began his working life as a postman at the age of fourteen. At seventeen he joined the Bass Rock Golf Club in North Berwick, which was a club for artisans. It did not have its own course and the members played on a public links. McLeod soon had some success in local competitions, and in 1903 he left for the United States to try his luck as a golf professional there, a route followed by many other Scots around that time as the golf clubs which were springing up rapidly in the U.S. had no experienced local professionals on whom they could call. He quickly found employment at the Rockford Country Club in Illinois, and later worked at several other clubs.\n\nDespite not having been a leading player in Scotland, McLeod soon made a name for himself as a first rate tournament player in the U.S. He acquired the nickname \"the wasp\" from fellow American professionals. He entered his first U.S. Open within weeks of his arrival in America, and later that year he was fifth at the Western Open. He won the Riverside Open in 1905 and the Western PGA Championship in both 1905 and 1907. The principal achievement of his career was his victory in the 1908 U.S. Open at Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. He was level with Willie Smith after four rounds, but won the playoff by 77 shots to 83. McLeod was five feet four inches tall, and at the end of the tournament he was weighed at 7 stone 10 pounds (108 pounds, 49 kilograms), making him the smallest man ever to take the title. He competed in the U.S. Open twenty-two times and had eight top ten finishes.\n\nMcLeod won several more professional tournaments: the 1909 and 1920 North and South Open at Pinehurst, the 1912 Shawnee Open, the 1924 St. Petersburg Open and the 1927 Maryland Open. In 1919 he was runner up to Jim Barnes in the PGA Championship. He took part in both the 1921 challenge match between teams of U.S based and British based professionals at Gleneagles, Perth and Kinross, Scotland, and in the follow-up 1926 match which was the immediate precursor of the first Ryder Cup match in 1927. During this period McLeod wintered at Temple Terrace, Florida (1925–26) where he worked with James Thomson from North Berwick. It was in Florida that McLeod was involved in the first 'Professional Golf League' in 1925. As the number of golf courses increased, many of top professionals were signed up in the winter months to represent the Florida clubs in a team competition. Walter Hagen and Joe Kirkwood, Sr. were signed up to Pasadena Country Club, Jim Barnes and Fred McLeod played for Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club and Gene Sarazen and Leo Diegel represented Hollywood Country Club. Although exhibition matches were still popular, this team format increased the players' earnings as they received 60% of the $2 entrance fee paid by spectators at the gate. At Augusta National Golf Club, he played in the first four editions of the Masters Tournament from 1934–37, won the 1938 PGA Seniors' Championship held there, and acted as an honorary starter at the Masters from 1963 to 1976. He was a member of the group of senior professionals which established the senior division of the PGA of America in 1937.\n\nMcLeod died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 94.

Its boundaries are the Mississippi River to the north and east, Interstate 94 to the south, and Hiawatha Avenue and Interstate 35W to the west. It has a longstanding tradition of cultural diversity and settlement, with a robust arts tradition.\n\nCedar-Riverside is one of the most diverse areas in Minneapolis-St. Paul. It is home to a number of the 100 or so different languages that are spoken in the Twin Cities. A vibrant neighborhood, it boasts many restaurants, cafés, bars, and venues for performance art and music.\n\nThe Cedar-Riverside neighborhood is historically known for its immigrant population, beginning in the late 1940s post-World War II with immigrants from eastern Europe. With the arrival of many new Cambodian, Somali, and especially Latino immigrants, hospitals now also offer services in other languages to accommodate patients whose mother tongue is not English. Employers such as Amazon have worked with the community to provide jobs and reduce the unemployment rate from 20 percent (in year 2017). Amazon hired 1,500 workers from the Cedar-Riverside job center and initially provided busing for workers to commute to its Shakopee distribution center but cut this service in late 2017.\n\nThe neighborhood is part of the University community, and is dominated by the West Bank campus of the University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus, which includes the Law School, Carlson School of Management, Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, and West Bank Arts Quarter. The East and West Bank of the U of M are connected by the Washington Avenue Bridge. The acquisition of a number of residential blocks by the University for expansion of the West Bank campus was controversial in the 1960s.\n\nThe neighborhood is also home to Augsburg University, a private liberal arts college and St. Catherine University's Minneapolis campus.\n\nIt is served by the Blue and Green light rail lines. It is the only neighborhood in the Twin Cities with two light rail stops. Two popular mixed-use bike/pedstrian paths, Hiawatha LRT Trail and Samatar Crossing, also connect the neighborhood to the downtown area and to neighborhoods further south.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Cedar-Riverside had a sizable Scandinavian immigrant community, most of whose members labored in the Mississippi River's lumber and milling industries. It later evolved into a hub for intellectuals, hippies, radical activists, actors, musicians and artists during the 1960s and 70s. In keeping with its tradition of ethnic and cultural diversity, the neighborhood is today home to the largest immigrant community in the Twin Cities. Somalis are now the predominant minority group in the area, resulting in the neighborhood being nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu.\"\n\nAccording to U.S. Census data from the 2005 to 2010 periods, the neighborhood's race and ethnicity profile is as follows: 45.0% Black or African American, 37.1% White, 10.9% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3.4% Hispanic or Latino, 2.8% two or more races, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, and 0.2% other race.\n\nAbout 51.7% of residents are female and 48.3% are male. Most citizens are young (16.7% are younger than 18), with 18- to 24-year-olds and 25- to 34-year-olds, respectively, representing 41.0% and 15.4% of people in Cedar Riverside.\n\nThe neighborhood's overall population has risen at a moderate but steady rate, from 6,368 in 1990 to 7,545 in 2000 to 8,094 in 2010.\n\nThe median household income could not be tabulated for the 2005-2009 period due to large error margins. However, it was $18,543 in 1999.\n\nCrime statistics released by the Minneapolis Police Department for all of its neighborhoods indicate that between January and May 2012, Cedar Riverside had 134 instances of vice, mainly consisting of various forms of theft. Only one homicide was reported over this period. The neighborhood's statistics were comparable to the citywide average, and were a fraction of those of the neighborhood with the highest reported number of incidents, Downtown West.\n\nOverall, according to police, crime peaked in the period between 2002 and 2006, and has steadily declined in the following 5 years. By 2011, instances of serious crime had dropped a reported 40%.\n\nThe neighborhood has been a port of entry for immigrants since Swedes, Germans, and Bohemians began arriving in large numbers during the late 19th century. Cedar Avenue became a hub of the Minneapolis Scandinavian community in the late 1800s. Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish were spoken in many of the businesses, and in the early days, stars of Swedish American vaudeville entertained at Dania Hall, Mozart Hall and The Southern Theater.\n\nThere was Samuelsen’s confectionery and soda shop, Hagen's appliance store, Moberg’s Norwegian deli, and a host of other Scandinavian-owned businesses. On Cedar Avenue was Dania Hall, where the Danish community would meet. An eclectic mix of Gothic and classical styles, the building included a dining hall and kitchen in the basement, commercial space on the first floor, offices for the Society of Dania plus billiard and reading rooms on the second floor. A theater/assembly hall on the third and fourth floors featured Scandinavian vaudeville acts and weekend dances. On the corner of Cedar and Washington, just before the Washington Ave Bridge, was the Breezy Point Tavern owned by Oscar Carlsen, a Norwegian immigrant from the turn of the 20th century. Oscar had come to Minnesota to work in the lumber camps and saved a stake to buy this tavern.\n\nWhere men in the community once worked in small businesses, or as skilled tradesmen, and workers for the railroad, flour mills, and breweries, Cedar-Riverside declined as a core community in the 1920s due to the impact of Prohibition on the entertainment district. Into the 1940s, Cedar-Riverside remained heavily Scandinavian. Postwar immigrants from all over Eastern Europe then settled in the area. The junction of Washington Avenue, Cedar Avenue, and 19th Avenue was known as Seven Corners. The Cedar-Riverside area had been known as \"Snoose Boulevard\" (Snusgatan) because so many Scandinavians lived there.\n\nThe West Bank, with the locally infamous Seven Corners district, mouldered into a skid row scene in the 1950s. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the area became the center of the University-oriented counterculture and antiwar movement. It was home to local hippies, protesters, and other anti-establishment groups between the 1960s and early 1970s. During those days, the neighborhood was known as the \"Haight-Ashbury of the Midwest.\"\n\nThe West Bank was home to McCosh's secondhand book store, a center for Beat and Hippie left-leaning bookworms, and later Things, probably the first head shop in the Twin Cities, which sold counterculture curios, anti-war buttons and posters, incense and drug paraphernalia. Marijuana, hashish and LSD were readily available in the area after about 1967. A community of hippies — and numerous students and hangers-on who emulated the hippie lifestyle (at least on weekends) — lived in old rental houses in the area and congregated at coffeehouses, such as the Extemporé, The Scholar and the Broken Drum, and at bars, such as the Triangle Bar, the Viking, Caesar's, The Mixers and the Music Bar. (The latter burned down the night Robert Kennedy was assassinated, and eventually was replaced by a \"people's park\"). The Triangle often featured performers and recording artists Dave Ray, Tony Glover and John Koerner, who had associated to some degree with Bob Dylan during his brief Minneapolis sojourn.\n\nIn 1973, the Riverside Plaza apartment complex was opened. Designed by architect and Cedar-Riverside resident Ralph Rapson, the tall buildings with their signature colored panels are a Minneapolis landmark and were featured as the residence of Mary Richards in later seasons of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\". Many of the businesses that were established during that time — Martha's Antiques, the Whale Leather Shop, the Five Corners Saloon, Richter's Drug Store and Smith's Leather Shop — eventually went out of business, gradually giving way to newer stores and shops. The Depth of Field also closed in the last half of 2019.\n\nThe neighborhood's past still has an influence in the present. Some of the businesses in the area harken back to an earlier time, like the worker-controlled punk hangout, Hard Times Café and the now-closed North Country Food Co-Op. In fact, some of the businesses, specifically in the Seven Corners district, use the history to promote their own business, such as the \"Legend of the Seven Switchmen.\"\n\nFairview Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital figured prominently in the neighborhood, being only a few blocks away. Fairview and St. Mary's, which merged in 1986, later merged with the University of Minnesota Hospitals, forming a major medical complex straddling the Mississippi River. The organization is now known as University of Minnesota Medical Center.\n\nCedar-Riverside is home to a thriving arts culture. There are many playhouses and theatre groups in the area, including the Mixed Blood Theatre Company, Theatre in the Round, and The Southern Theater. There is also a percolating music scene, with musicians frequenting venues like The Cedar Cultural Center,The Cabooze, The Red Sea, Part Wolf MPLS, Acadia Cafe, and Palmer's Bar.\n\nAdditionally, the West Bank music scene is known as a catalyst for major musicians, such as Bonnie Raitt, Leo Kottke, Butch Thompson (Jazz Originals), Peter Ostroushko (Prairie Home Companion), Dave \"Snaker\" Ray (Koerner, Ray & Glover), Erik Anderson (The Wallets), Dakota Dave Hull, Sean Blackburn (Prairie Home Companion), Bill Hinkley (Minnesota Music Hall of Fame), Karen Mueller (Autoharp Hall of Fame), and, to a lesser extent, Bob Dylan.\n\nMany of these musicians also taught, performed and/or jammed at the West Bank School of Music. The Cedar Cultural Center, Extempore' Coffeehouse, Scholar Coffeehouse, New Riverside Cafe, Viking Bar, 400 Bar, 7 Corners, Whisky Junction, Cabooze and Cedarfest have likewise all been popular music venues in their time. Established in 1978, KFAI community radio has broadcast a mix of community talk radio and folk and avant-garde music from around the world from the Bailey building since 1991.\n\nThe arts flavor of the area is enhanced by the presence of Augsburg University and the University of Minnesota's West Bank Arts Quarter, which is home to the University’s arts programs.\n\nCedar Riverside also plays host to the annual Zombie Pub Crawl. In the 2005 the Minneapolis Zombie Pub Crawl began with about 100 participants. In 2011 Cedar Riverside hosted approximately 18,000 individuals for the seventh annual zombie pub crawl.\n\n\n\n\nPhotos\nThe New Riverside Cafe\nArticles\nBook and CD\nOnline book\n"}

It was located in the present day region of Banat, which was named after this province. The province was abolished in 1778 and incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn the official documents of the time and also in all of native languages of the region, the name of the province appears in two basic forms, first derived from the name of Temeswar (Timișoara), second derived from the name of Temes region: in German - , Romanian - , Serbian - , , Hungarian - and Latin - .\n\nBefore the Habsburg province was established, several other entities had existed in the Banat region, including: the Voivodeship of Glad (9th century), the Voivodeship of Ahtum (11th century), the Banate of Severin frontier province of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (from 1233 to the 16th century), the Ottoman province named Eyalet of Temeşvar (1552–1716), and the Banate of Lugos and Karansebes province within the Principality of Transylvania (16th–17th century), which was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire as a whole.\n\nAlthough after the Austro-Ottoman war (1683–1697) and before the treaty of Karlowitz (1699) most parts of Banat were temporarily controlled by the forces of Prince Eugene of Savoy; in consequence of the treaty, the Ottoman sovereignty was recognized over the region with the fort of Temeşvar. However, as a result of the Spanish Succession War and the Rákóczi's War for Independence, the Habsburgs were inclined to direct their attention elsewhere within their country, and there was no attempt on their part to gain any territories from the Ottomans until 1710.\n\nIn the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18, Prince Eugene of Savoy conquered the Banat region from the Ottoman Empire, which was recognized by the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718). The Habsburg Monarchy then established a new military administrative region there under the name of Banat of Temeswar. The capital of the province became Temeswar. The province remained under military administration until 1751 when civil administration was introduced in northern parts of the region by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.\n\nFrom 1718 to 1739, Banat of Temeswar included not only the Banat region, but also parts of present-day eastern Serbia along the southern bank of the Danube river. Following the Treaty of Belgrade (1739), areas along the southern bank of Danube returned under Ottoman control. In 1751, the southern parts of Banat were excluded from the province and the Banatian Military Frontier was established in that area.\n\nThe Banat of Temeswar was abolished in 1778, and in 1779, it was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, while its former territory was divided into three counties: Torontál, Temes and Krassó-Szörény. The southern part of the Banat region, which was part of the Banat of Temeswar until 1751, remained part of the Military Frontier (Banat Krajina) until 1873.\n\nThe province was bound to repopulate after the Habsburg conquest because it had a low population density on the grounds that the territory sustained a lot of adversity from the previous wars. The population density was among the lowest in Europe; some researchers suggest that it was around 1 person / square kilometres. According to the first census conducted by the Habsburg military authorities, the population of Banat numbered about 20,000 inhabitants, mostly Serbs. The former Muslim population of Banat had left the area immediately before and during the Habsburg conquest. The low population density resulted in the territory being repopulated by German families coming from Austrian and southern German lands, Romanians coming from Wallachia and Transylvania, by Slovaks from the north, and by Serb refugees coming from the Ottoman Empire, while some Serbs arrived in the area from other parts of the Habsburg Monarchy. Colonization of various ethnic groups in the area lasted until the early 19th century. The government organized regimental districts which mostly had Serb population with special privileges in exchange for defending the borders. The area also lost its Hungarian population in the 16th century, but Hungarians were not allowed to return until the 1740s, because the Habsburgs regarded them as \"politically unreliable\". Thus, Hungarians were almost totally absent from Banat in the first half of the 18th century. After the permission was given, Hungarian settlers arrived from different parts of the kingdom (mainly from Transdanubia, Csongrád county and the Jász and Kun districts).\n\nAccording to data from 1774, the population of the Banat of Temeswar was composed of: \n\nThe first official census took part during the rule of Joseph II, from the late 18th century. This shows Romanian majority in the east, Serbian in the west, and numerous German population in the whole area.\n\nGovernors of Banat of Temeswar did not have the title of \"ban\". They were military governors and chefs of provincial administration (in German: Militärpräsidenten der Landesadministration des Temescher Banats).\n\n\n"}

He was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed.\n\nIn a 13-season big league career, Jay posted a 99–91 win-loss record, with 999 strikeouts, and a 3.77 earned run average (ERA), in 1546.1 innings.\n\nIn July 2008, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to being the first Little League player to advance to the major leagues, Jay was one of the first \"bonus baby\" players in the major leagues.

On September 20, 1953, at the age of 17, making his first career start (having pitched only one game in relief previous), he pitched a seven-inning complete game shutout (the game was shortened due to rain), but generally was unremarkable in his two years with the team. Following the end of his two years, he was sent to the minors to gain experience on a staff that already was loaded with Hall of Famer Warren Spahn, Bob Buhl and Lew Burdette. Jay went 7–5 with an ERA of 2.14 in 18 games for the Braves in his best season (1958), becoming the first pitcher (fourth player overall) to win the NL Player of the Month award in July (going 5-2 in 7 starts, posting an ERA of 1.39, and earning 46 SO in 58.1 IP) but a broken finger kept him out of the World Series.\n\nThe Braves traded Jay to the Cincinnati Reds after the 1960 season for infielder Roy McMillan. Braves General Manager at the time, John McHale, reportedly made the deal based on the feeling that Carl Willey could do a better job for Milwaukee than Jay.\n\nJay took full advantage of the trade, as he became a key figure in the Reds' stunning revival in 1961. Jay won 21 games (the first Red to win 20 since Ewell Blackwell in 1947), tied for the league lead in wins and shutouts, and won his second NL Player of the Month award in May (winning all six starts including a 4 May one-hitter against the Phillies, a 2.72 ERA, and 38 SO in 51.2 IP) as the Reds surged to their first National League pennant since 1940. However, the Reds faced a powerful New York Yankees that won 109 games and featured Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, as the Reds lost in five game. However, the lone Reds' win occurred in Game 2, a 6-2 victory as Jay threw a complete-game four-hitter at Yankee Stadium. Jay's single-game career highlight.\n\nOn May 1, 1962, at the Polo Grounds, off New York Mets pitcher Sherman Jones, Jay hit a three-run HR (base runners were Wally Post and Leo Cárdenas), in the 6th inning, for his first MLB home run. At Crosley Field, on May 28, 1962, Jay hit his only other career home run, off Houston Colt .45s pitcher Bobby Tiefenauer, in the 5th inning, a two-run blast (Don Zimmer was on base).\n\nJay also won 21 games in 1962 as the Reds won 98 games to finish in third-place behind the Giants and Dodgers. Jay's heavy workload in 1961 and '62 took a toll the following year as he struggled to a 7–18 record. Jay posted a (11-11) in 1964 as the Reds finished a single game behind the eventual World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. He would finish his career by returning to the Braves for their initial season in Atlanta in 1966.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2152749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152749", "title": "Clean Development Mechanism", "text": "Clean Development Mechanism\n\nThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one of the Flexible Mechanisms defined in the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC, 2007) that provides for emissions reduction projects which generate Certified Emission Reduction units (CERs) which may be traded in emissions trading schemes. The market crashed in 2012 when the value of credits collapsed and thousands of projects were left with unclaimed credits. The struggle about what to do with the old credits sank the 2019 COP 25 in Madrid.\n\nThe CDM, defined in Article 12 of the Protocol, was intended to meet two objectives: \n\"Annex I\" parties are the countries listed in Annex I of the treaty, the industrialized countries. Non-Annex I parties are developing countries.\n\nThe CDM addresses the second objective by allowing the Annex I countries to meet part of their emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by buying Certified Emission Reduction units from CDM emission reduction projects in developing countries (\"Carbon Trust\", 2009, p. 14). Both the projects and the issue of CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these emission reductions are real and \"additional.\" The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nThe CDM allows industrialized countries to buy CERs and to invest in emission reductions where it is cheapest globally (Grubb, 2003, p. 159). Between 2001, which was the first year CDM projects could be registered and 7 September 2012, the CDM issued 1 billion Certified Emission Reduction units. As of 1 June 2013, 57% of all CERs had been issued for projects based on destroying either HFC-23 (38%) or NO (19%). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) was included in the CDM carbon offsetting scheme in December 2011.\n\nHowever, a number of weaknesses of the CDM have been identified (World Bank, 2010, p. 265-267). Several of these issues were addressed by the new Program of Activities (PoA), which moves to approving 'bundles' of projects instead of accrediting each project individually. In 2012, the report \"Climate Change, Carbon Markets and the CDM: A Call to Action\" said governments urgently needed to address the future of the CDM. It suggested the CDM was in danger of collapse because of the low price of carbon and the failure of governments to guarantee its existence into the future. Writing on the website of the Climate & Development Knowledge Network, Yolanda Kakabadse, a member of the investigating panel for the report and founder of Fundación Futuro Latinamericano, said a strong CDM is needed to support the political consensus essential for future climate progress. \"Therefore we must do everything in our hands to keep it working,\" she said.\n\nThe clean development mechanism is one of the \"flexibility mechanisms\" defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility mechanisms were designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction commitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007). The flexibility mechanisms were introduced into the Kyoto Protocol by the US government. Developing countries were highly skeptical and fiercely opposed to the flexibility mechanisms (\"Carbon Trust\", 2009, p. 6). However, the international negotiations over the follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that the mechanisms will continue.\n\nThe purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the \"non-Annex I\" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The CDM is one of the Protocol's \"project-based\" mechanisms, in that the CDM is designed to promote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction \"production\" (Toth \"et al\"., 2001, p. 660). These reductions are \"produced\" and then subtracted against a hypothetical \"baseline\" of emissions. The baseline emissions are the emissions that are predicted to occur in the absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are \"credited\" against this baseline, in the sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts.\n\nThe economic basis for including developing countries in efforts to reduce emissions is that emission cuts are thought to be less expensive in developing countries than developed countries (Goldemberg \"et al\"., 1996, p. 30; Grubb, 2003, p. 159). For example, in developing countries, environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in developed countries (Sathaye \"et al\"., 2001, p. 387-389). Thus, it is widely thought that there is greater potential for developing countries to reduce their emissions than developed countries.\n\nEmissions from developing countries are projected to increase substantially over this century (Goldemberg \"et al\"., 1996, p. 29). Infrastructure decisions made in developing countries could therefore have a very large influence on future efforts to limit total global emissions (Fisher \"et al\"., 2007). The CDM is designed to start developing countries off on a path towards less pollution, with industrialised (Annex B) countries paying for the reductions.\n\nThere were two main concerns about the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, pp. 14–15). One was over the additionality of emission reductions produced by the CDM (see the section on \"additionality\"). The other was whether it would allow rich, northern countries, and in particular, companies, to impose projects that were contrary to the development interests of host countries. To alleviate this concern, the CDM requires host countries to confirm that CDM projects contribute to their own sustainable development. International rules also prohibit credits for some kinds of activities, notably nuclear power and avoided deforestation.\n\nTo prevent industrialised countries from making unlimited use of CDM, the framework has a provision that use of CDM be ‘supplemental’ to domestic actions to reduce emissions. This wording has led to a wide range of interpretations - the Netherlands for example aims to achieve half of its required emission reductions (from a BAU baseline) by CDM. It treats Dutch companies' purchases of European Union Emission Trading Scheme allowances from companies in other countries as part of its domestic actions.\n\nThe CDM gained momentum in 2005 after the Kyoto Protocol took effect. Before the Protocol entered into force, investors considered this a key risk factor. The initial years of operation yielded fewer CDM credits than supporters had hoped for, as parties did not provide sufficient funding to the EB, which left it understaffed.\n\nThe Adaptation Fund was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Fund is to be financed with a share of proceeds from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities and receive funds from other sources.\n\nAn industrialised country that wishes to get credits from a CDM project must obtain the consent of the developing country hosting the project and their agreement that the project will contribute to sustainable development. Then, using methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (EB), the applicant industrialised country must make the case that the carbon project would not have happened anyway (establishing additionality), and must establish a baseline estimating the future emissions in absence of the registered project. The case is then validated by a third party agency, called a Designated Operational Entity (DOE), to ensure the project results in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. The EB then decides whether or not to register (approve) the project. If a project is registered and implemented, the EB issues credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs, commonly known as carbon credits, where each unit is equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of COe, e.g. CO or its equivalent), to project participants based on the monitored difference between the baseline and the actual emissions, verified by the DOE.\n\nTo avoid giving credits to projects that would have happened anyway (\"freeriders\"), specified rules ensure the additionality of the proposed project, that is, ensure the project reduces emissions more than would have occurred in the absence of the intervention created by the CDM. At present, the CDM Executive Board deems a project additional if its proponents can document that realistic alternative scenarios to the proposed project would be more economically attractive or that the project faces barriers that CDM helps it overcome. Current Guidance from the EB is available at the UNFCCC website.\n\nThe determination of additionality and the calculation of emission reductions depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. Accordingly, the CDM process requires an established baseline or comparative emission estimate. The construction of a project baseline often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners involved in the project could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits. Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem.\n\nAny proposed CDM project has to use an approved baseline and monitoring methodology to be validated, approved and registered. Baseline Methodology will set steps to determine the baseline within certain applicability conditions whilst monitoring methodology will set specific steps to determine monitoring parameters, quality assurance, equipment to be used, in order to obtain data to calculate the emission reductions. Those approved methodologies are all coded: \n\nAM - Approved Methodology\n\nACM - Approved Consolidated Methodolog\n\nAMS - Approved Methodology for Small Scale Projects\n\nARAM - Aforestation and Reforestation Approved Methodologies\n\nAll baseline methodologies approved by Executive Board are publicly available along with relevant guidance on the UNFCCC CDM website. If a DOE determines that a proposed project activity intends to use a new baseline methodology, it shall, prior to the submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology to the EB for review, i.e. consideration and approval, if appropriate.\n\nAccording to Burniaux \"et al\"., 2009, p. 37, crediting mechanisms like the CDM could play three important roles in climate change mitigation :\n\nAccording to Burniaux \"et al\". (2009, p. 37), the cost-saving potential of a well-functioning crediting mechanism appears to be very large. Compared to baseline costs (i.e., costs where emission reductions only take place in Annex I countries), if the cap on offset use was set at 20%, one estimate suggests mitigation costs could be halved. This cost saving, however, should be viewed as an upper bound: it assumes no transaction costs and no uncertainty on the delivery of emission savings. Annex I countries who stand to gain most from crediting include Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In this economic model, non-Annex I countries enjoy a slight income gain from exploiting low cost emission reductions.\nActual transaction cost in the CDM are rather high, which is problematic for smaller projects. This issue is addressed by the Program of Activities (PoA) modality.\n\nCarbon leakage\n\nIn theory, leakage may be reduced by crediting mechanisms (Burniaux \"et al.\", 2009, p. 38). In practice, the amount of leakage partly depends on the definition of the baseline against which credits are granted. The current CDM approach already incorporates some leakage. Thus, reductions in leakage due to the CDM may, in fact, be small or even non-existent.\n\nAdditionality, transaction costs and bottlenecks\n\nIn order to maintain the environmental effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol, emission savings from the CDM must be additional (World Bank, 2010, p. 265). Without additionality, the CDM amounts to an income transfer to non-Annex I countries (Burniaux \"et al\"., 2009, p. 40). Additionality is, however, difficult to prove, the subject of vigorous debate.\n\nBurniaux \"et al\". (2009) commented on the large transaction costs of establishing additionality. Assessing additionality has created delays (bottlenecks) in approving CDM projects. According to the World Bank (2010), there are significant constraints to the continued growth of the CDM to support mitigation in developing countries.\n\nIncentives\n\nThe CDM rewards emissions reductions, but does not penalize emission increases (Burniaux \"et al\"., 2009, p. 41). It therefore comes close to being an emissions reduction subsidy. This can create a perverse incentive for firms to raise their emissions in the short-term, with the aim of getting credits for reducing emissions in the long-term.\n\nAnother difficulty is that the CDM might reduce the incentive for non-Annex I countries to cap their emissions. This is because most developing countries benefit more from a well-functioning crediting mechanism than from a world emissions trading scheme (ETS), where their emissions are capped. This is true except in cases where the allocation of emissions rights (i.e., the amount of emissions that each country is allowed to emit) in the ETS is particularly favourable to developing countries.\n\nLocal resistance\n\nWhile the C in CDM stands for Clean, most projects might be better defined with the B from Big, from large hydropower to HFC or waste to energy and clean coal projects (which all together make the majority of credits generated through CDM). The argument in favor of the CDM is that it brings development to the South. However, in all continents the mainly Big Development it stands for is resisted by local people in those countries. A global coalition of researchers published a large report on African civil society resistance to CDM projects all over the continent. In New Delhi, India, a grassroots movement of wastepickers is resisting another CDM project on what the makers call 'the waste war' in Delhi. In Panama, a CDM project is blocking peace talks between the Panamanian government and the indigenous Ngöbe-Buglé people. Civil society groups and researchers in both North and South have complained for years that most CDM projects benefit big industries, while doing harm to excluded people. As local protests against CDM projects are arising on every continent, the notion that CDM 'brings development to the South' is contested.\n\nMarket deflation\n\nMost of the demand for CERs from the CDM comes from the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, which is the largest carbon market. In July 2012, the market price for CERs fell to new record low of €2.67 a tonne, a drop in price of about 70% in a year. Analysts attributed the low CER price to lower prices for European Union emissions allowances, oversupply of EU emissions allowances and the slowing European economy.\n\nIn September 2012, \"The Economist\" described the CDM as a \"complete disaster in the making\" and \"in need of a radical overhaul\". Carbon prices, including prices for CERs, had collapsed from $20 a tonne in August 2008 to below $5 in response to the Eurozone debt crisis reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. \"The Guardian\" reported that the CDM has \"essentially collapsed\", due to the prolonged downward trend in the price of CERs, which had been traded for as much as $20 (£12.50) a tonne before the global financial crisis to less than $3. With such low CER prices, potential projects were not commercially viable. In October 2012, CER prices fell to a new low of 1.36 euros a metric tonne on the London ICE Futures Europe exchange. In October 2012 Thomson Reuters Point Carbon calculated that the oversupply of units from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation would be 1,400 million units for the period up to 2020 and Point Carbon predicted that Certified Emission Reduction (CER) prices would to drop from €2 to 50 cents. On 12 December 2012 CER prices reached another record low of 31 cents. \"Bloomberg\" reported that Certified Emission Reduction prices had declined by 92 percent to 39 each cents in the 2012 year.\n\nWith costs of emission reduction typically much lower in developing countries than in industrialised countries, industrialised countries can comply with their emission reduction targets at much lower cost by receiving credits for emissions reduced in developing countries as long as administration costs are low.\n\nThe IPCC has projected GDP losses for OECD Europe with full use of CDM and Joint Implementation to between 0.13% and 0.81% of GDP versus 0.31% to 1.50% with only domestic action.\n\nWhile there would always be some cheap domestic emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per tonne CO equivalent. Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between €5 and €20 per tonne CO equivalent. The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the counterparty is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies.\n\nThe revenues of the CDM constitutes the largest source of mitigation finance to developing countries to date (World Bank, 2010, p. 261-262). Over the 2001 to 2012 period, CDM projects could raise $18 billion ($15 billion to $24 billion) in direct carbon revenues for developing countries. Actual revenues will depend on the price of carbon. It is estimated that some $95 billion in clean energy investment benefitted from the CDM over the 2002-08 period.\n\nThe CDM is the main source of income for the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund, which was established in 2007 to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (World Bank, 2010, p. 262-263). The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300 million and $600 million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price.\n\nSince 2000, the CDM has allowed crediting of project-based emission reductions in developing countries (Gupta \"et al\"., 2007). By 1 January 2005, projects submitted to the CDM amounted to less than 100 MtCOe of projected savings by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 18-19). The EU ETS started in January 2005, and the following month saw the Kyoto Protocol enter into force. The EU ETS allowed firms to comply with their commitments by buying offset credits, and thus created a perceived value to projects. The Kyoto Protocol set the CDM on a firm legal footing.\n\nBy the end of 2008, over 4,000 CDM projects had been submitted for validation, and of those, over 1,000 were registered by the CDM Executive Board, and were therefore entitled to be issued CERs (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 19). In 2010, the World Bank estimated that in 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs would be from China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%) (World Bank, 2010, p. 262). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean would make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).\n\nBy 14 September 2012, 4626 projects had been registered by the CDM Executive Board as CDM projects. These projects are expected to result in the issue of 648,232,798 certified emissions reductions. By 14 September 2012, the CDM Board had issued 1 billion CERs, 60% of which originated from projects in China. India, the Republic of Korea, and Brazil were issued with 15%, 9% and 7% of the total CERs.\n\nThe Himachal Pradesh Reforestation Project is claimed to be the world's largest CDM.\n\nThere are currently 29 transportation projects registered, the last was registered on February 25, 2013 and is hosted in China.\n\nSome CDM projects remove or destroy industrial gases, such as hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from the production of the refrigerant gas chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units.\n\nIn 2009, the Carbon Trust estimated that industrial gas projects such as those limiting HFC-23 emissions, would contribute about 20% of the CERs issued by the CDM in 2012. The Carbon Trust expressed the concern that projects for destroying HFC-23 were so profitable that coolant manufacturers could be building new factories to produce the coolant gas. (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 60). In September 2010, Sandbag estimated that in 2009 59% of the CERs used as offsets in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme originated from HFC-23 projects.\n\nAn example is the Plascon, Plasma arc plant that was installed by Quimobásicos S.A. de C.V in Monterrey, Mexico to eliminate of HCFC-23, a byproduct of the production of R-22 refrigerant gas.\n\nFrom 2005 to June 2012, 19 manufacturers of refrigerants (11 in China, 5 in India, and one each in Argentina, Mexico and South Korea), were issued with 46% of all the certified emissions reduction units from the CDM. David Hanrahan, the technical director of IDEAcarbon believes each plant would probably have earned an average of $20 million to $40 million a year from the CDM. The payments also incentivise the increased production of the ozone-depleting refrigerant HCFC-22, and discourage substitution of HCFC-22 with less harmful refrigerants.\n\nIn 2007 the CDM stopped accepting new refrigerant manufacturers into the CDM. In 2011, the CDM renewed contracts with the nineteen manufacturers on the condition that claims for HFC-23 destruction would be limited to 1 percent of their coolant production. However, in 2012, 18 percent of all CERs issued are expected to go to the 19 coolant plants, compared with 12 percent to 2,372 wind power plants and 0.2 percent to 312 solar projects.\n\nIn January 2011, the European Union Climate Change Committee banned the use of HFC-23 CERs in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme from 1 May 2013. The ban includes nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity, the under-mining of the Montreal Protocol, costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced developing countries getting too many CERs. From 23 December 2011, CERs from HFC-23 and N2O destruction projects were banned from use in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, unless they had been purchased under future delivery contracts entered into prior to 23 December 2011. The use of the future delivery contracts ends in June 2013.\n\nAs of 1 June 2013, the CDM had issued 505,125 CERs, or 38% of all CERs issued, to 23 HFC-23 destruction projects. A further 19% (or 255,666 CERs) had been issued to 108 NO destruction projects.\n\nWorld Bank (n.d., p. 12) described a number of barriers to the use of the CDM in least developed countries (LDCs). LDCs have experienced lower participation in the CDM to date. Four CDM decisions were highlighted as having a disproportionate negative impact on LDCs:\n\nOne of the difficulties of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 54-56). The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and NO. Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their additionality assessments. They compared establishing additionality to the balance of evidence in a legal system. Certainty in additionality is rare, and the higher the proof of additionality, the greater the risk of rejecting good projects to reduce emissions.\n\nA 2016 study by the Öko-Institut estimated that only 2% of the studied CDM projects had a high likelihood of ensuring that emission reductions are additional and are not over-estimated.\n\nAdditionality is much contested. There are many rival interpretations of additionality:\n\n\nA number of terms for different kinds of additionality have been discussed, leading to some confusion, particularly over the terms 'financial additionality' and 'investment additionality' which are sometimes used as synonyms. 'Investment additionality', however, was a concept discussed and ultimately rejected during negotiation of the Marrakech Accords. Investment additionality carried the idea that any project that surpasses a certain risk-adjusted profitability threshold would automatically be deemed non-additional. 'Financial additionality' is often defined as an economically non-viable project becoming viable as a direct result of CDM revenues.\n\nMany investors argue that the environmental additionality interpretation would make the CDM simpler. Environmental NGOs have argued that this interpretation would open the CDM to free-riders, permitting developed countries to emit more CO, while failing to produce emission reductions in the CDM host countries.\n\nGillenwater (2011) evaluated the various definitions of additionality used within the CDM community and provided a synthesis definition that rejects the notion of there being different types of additionality.\n\nSchneider (2007) produced a report on the CDM for the WWF. The findings of the report were based on a systematic evaluation of 93 randomly chosen registered CDM projects, as well as interviews and a literature survey (p. 5). According to Schneider (2007, p. 72), the additionality of a significant number of projects over the 2004-2007 period seemed to be either unlikely or questionable.\n\nIt is never possible to establish with certainty what would have happened without the CDM or in absence of a particular project, which is one common objection to the CDM. Nevertheless, official guidelines have been designed to facilitate uniform assessment, set by the CDM Executive Board for assessing additionality.\n\nAn argument against additionality is based on the fact that developing countries are not subject to emission caps in the Kyoto Protocol (Müller, 2009, pp. \"iv\", 9-10). On these basis, \"business-as-usual\" (BAU) emissions (i.e., emissions that would occur without any efforts to reduce them) in developing countries should be allowed. By setting a BAU baseline, this can be interpreted as being a target for developing countries. Thus, it is, in effect, a restriction on their right to emit without a cap. This can be used as an argument against having additionality, in the sense that non-additional (i.e., emission reductions that would have taken place under BAU) emission reductions should be credited.\n\nMüller (2009) argued that compromise was necessary between having additionality and not having it. In his view, additionality should sometimes be used, but other times, it shouldn't.\n\nAccording to World Bank (n.d., pp. 16–17), additionality is crucial in maintaining the environmental integrity of the carbon market. To maintain this integrity, it was suggested that projects meeting or exceeding ambitious policy objectives or technical standards could be deemed additional.\n\nPioneering research has suggested that an average of approximately 30% of the money spent on the open market buying CDM credits goes directly to project operating and capital expenditure costs.\nOther significant costs include the broker's premium (about 30%, understood to represent the risk of a project not delivering) and the project shareholders' dividend (another 30%). The researchers noted that the sample of projects studied was small, the range of figures was wide and that their methodology of estimating values slightly overstated the average broker's premium.\n\nOne of the main problems concerning CDM-projects is the risk of fraud. The most common practices are covering up the fact that the projects are financially viable by themselves and that the emission reductions acquired through the CDM-project aren’t additional. Exaggerating the carbon benefits is also a common practice, just as carbon leakage. Sometimes a company even produces more to receive more CERs.\n\nMost of the doubtful projects are Industrial gas projects. Even though only 1.7% of all CDM-projects can be qualified as such, extraordinarily they account for half to 69% of all CERs that have been issued, contributing to a collapse in the global market for all CERs. Since the cost of dismantling these gases is very low compared to the market price of the CERs, very large profits can be made by companies setting up these projects. In this way, the CDM has become a stimulus for carbon leakage, or even to simply produce more.\n\nHydro-projects are also quite problematic. Barbara Haye calculated that more than a third of all hydro-projects recognized as a CDM-project ‘were already completed at the time of registration and almost all were already under construction’, which means that CERs are issued for projects that aren’t additional, which again indirectly leads to higher emissions. Moreover, most of the proposed carbon benefits of these projects are exaggerated.\n\nWhy are these projects approved by the Clean_Development_Mechanism Executive Board (EB)?’, one might wonder. One of the main problems is that the EB is a highly politicized body. People taking a place in the board aren’t independent technocrats, but are elected as representatives of their respective countries. They face pressure from their own & other (powerful) countries, the World Bank (that subsidizes certain projects), and other lobbying organisations. This, combined with a lack of transparency regarding the decisions of the board leads to the members favouring political-economical over technical or scientific considerations. It seems clear that the CDM isn’t governed according to the rules of ‘good governance’. Solving this problem might require a genuine democratization in the election of the EB-members and thus a shift in thinking from government to governance. In practice this would mean that all the stakeholders should get a voice in who can have a seat in the EB.\n\nAnother important factor in the dysfunctionality of the EB is the lack of time, staff and financial resources it has to fully evaluate a project proposal. Moreover, the verification of a project is often outsourced to companies that also deliver services (such as accounting or consultancy) to enterprises setting up these same projects. In this way, the verifiers have serious incentives to deliver a positive report to the EB. This indicates that implementation is the place where the shoe pinches, as usually happens in environmental issues (mostly due to a lack of funds).\n\nThere have been indications in recent years that the EB is becoming more strict in its decisions, due to the huge criticism and the board getting more experience.\n\nThe first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol excluded forest conservation as well as avoided deforestation from the CDM for a variety of political, practical and ethical reasons. However, carbon emissions from deforestation represent 18-25% of all emissions, and will account for more carbon emissions in the next five years than all emissions from all aircraft since the Wright Brothers until at least 2025. This means that there have been growing calls for the inclusion of forests in CDM schemes for the second commitment period from a variety of sectors, under the leadership of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, and brought together under the Forests Now Declaration, which has been signed by over 300 NGOs, business leaders, and policy makers. There is so far no international agreement about whether projects avoiding deforestation or conserving forests should be initiated through separate policies and measures or stimulated through the carbon market. One major concern is the enormous monitoring effort needed in order to make sure projects are indeed leading to increased carbon storage. There is also local opposition. For example, May 2, 2008, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), Indigenous leaders from around the world protested against the Clean Energy Mechanisms, especially against Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.\n\n\"Combating global warming has broadly two components: decreasing the release of greenhouse gases and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emitters, such as coal-fired power plants, are known as \"sources\", and places where carbon and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can be sequestered, i.e. kept out of the atmosphere, are known as \"sinks\".\n\nThe world's forests, particularly rain forests, are important carbon sinks, both because of their uptake of CO through photosynthesis and because of the amount of carbon stored in their woody biomass and the soil. When rain forests are logged and burned, not only do we lose the forests' capacity to take up CO from the atmosphere, but also the carbon stored in that biomass and soil is released into the atmosphere through release of roots from the soil and the burning of the woody plant matter.\n\nAn emerging proposal, Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), would allow rain forest preservation to qualify for CDM project status. REDD has gained support through recent meetings of the COP, and will be examined at Copenhagen.\n\nIn July 2011, Reuters reported that a 4,000 MW coal thermal electricity generation plant in Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh had been registered with the CDM. CDM Watch and the Sierra Club criticised the plant's registration and its eligibility for certified emission reduction units as clearly not additional. A CDM spokesperson dismissed these claims. According to information provided to Reuters, there are total of five coal-fired electricity plants registered with the CDM, four in India with a capacity of 10,640 MW and one 2,000 MW plant in China. The five plants are eligible to receive 68.2 million CERs over a 10-year period with an estimated value of 661 million euros ($919 million) at a CER price of 9.70 euros.\n\nIn September 2012, the Executive Board of the Clean Development Mechanism adopted rules confirming that new coal thermal power generation plants could be registered as CDM projects and could use the simplified rules called 'Programmes of Activities'. The organisation CDM-Watch described the decision as inconsistent with the objective of the CDM as it subsidised the construction of new coal power plants. CDM-Watch described the CERs that would be issued as \"non-additional dirty carbon credits\".\n\nSome CERs are produced from CDM projects at refrigerant-producing factories in non-Annex I countries that generate the powerful greenhouse gas HFC 23 as a by-product. These projects dominated the CDM's early growth, and are expected to generate 20% of all credited emission reductions by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 60). Paying for facilities to destroy HFC-23 can cost only 0.2-0.5 €/tCO. Industrialized countries were, however, paying around 20 €/tCO for reductions that cost below 1 €/tCO. This provoked strong criticism.\n\nThe scale of profits generated by HFC-23 projects threatened distortions in competitiveness with plants in industrialized countries that had already cleaned up their emissions (p. 60). In an attempt to address concerns over HFC-23 projects, the CDM Executive Board made changes in how these projects are credited. According to the Carbon Trust (2009, p. 60), these changes effectively ensure that:\n\nCarbon Trust (2009, p. 60) argued that criticizing the CDM for finding low-cost reductions seemed perverse. They also argued that addressing the problem with targeted funding was easy with hindsight, and that before the CDM, these emission reduction opportunities were not taken.\n\nNGOs have criticized the inclusion of large hydropower projects, which they consider unsustainable, as CDM projects.{https://www.internationalrivers.org/km/taxonomy/term/1024} Lately, both the CDM EB and investors have become concerned about such projects for potential lack of additionality. One reason was that many of these projects had started well before applying for CDM status. In June 2008, third party validator TÜV SÜD Group rejected a hydropower project in China because the project proponents could not document that they had seriously considered CDM at the time the project was started. In July 2008, third party validators agreed that projects applying for CDM status more than one year after having taken their investment decision should not qualify for CDM status. Currently, the largest power plant to receive CDM registration is the Jirau Hydroelectric Plant in Brazil.\n\nHydropower projects larger than 20 MW must document that they follow World Commission on Dams guidelines or similar guidelines in order to qualify for the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. As of 21 July 2008, CERs from hydropower projects are not listed on European carbon exchanges, because different member states interpret these limitations differently.\n\nOrganisation seeking to measure the degree of compliance of individual projects with WCD principles can use the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol, recommended as the most practical currently available evaluation tool.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nIn the initial phase of the CDM, policy makers and NGOs were concerned about the lack of renewable energy CDM projects. As the new CDM projects are now predominantly renewables and energy efficiency projects, this is now less of an issue.\n\nSinks\n\nNGOs, as well as several governments, have consistently been sceptical towards the inclusion of sinks as CDM projects. The main reasons were fear of oversupply, that such projects cannot guarantee permanent storage of carbon, and that the methods of accounting for carbon storage in biomass are complex and still under development. Consequently, two separate carbon currencies (temporary CERs and long-term CERs) were created for such projects. Such credits cannot be imported to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. The lack of demand for such projects have resulted in very limited supply: Currently (21 July 2008), only one sinks project has been registered under CDM.\n\nWindfarms in Western Sahara\n\nIn 2012, it was announced, that a windfarm complex is going to be located near Laayoune, the capital city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Since this project is to be established under tight collaboration between the UN (which itself recognizes Western Sahara's status of a non-autonomous country) and the Moroccan government, it has been questioned by many parties supporting Western Sahara independence, including the Polisario.\n\nIn response to concerns of unsustainable projects or spurious credits, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other NGOs devised a ‘Gold Standard’ methodology to certify projects that uses much stricter criteria than required, such as allowing only renewable energy projects.\n\nFor example, a South African brick kiln was faced with a business decision; replace its depleted energy supply with coal from a new mine, or build a difficult but cleaner natural gas pipeline to another country. They chose to build the pipeline with SASOL. SASOL claimed the difference in GHG emissions as a CDM credit, comparing emissions from the pipeline to the contemplated coal mine.\nDuring its approval process, the validators noted that changing the supply from coal to gas met the CDM's 'additionality' criteria and was the least cost-effective option.\nHowever, there were unofficial reports that the fuel change was going to take place anyway, although this was later denied by the company's press office.\n\nSchneider (2007, p. 73) commented on the success of the CDM in reducing emissions from industrial plants and landfills. Schneider (2007) concluded by stating that if concerns over the CDM are properly addressed, it would continue to be an \"important instrument in the fight against climate change.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2152760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152760", "title": "Crimson Guard", "text": "Crimson Guard\n\nThe Crimson Guard is an elite organization within the fictional G.I. Joe universe. They are members of Cobra Command, the nemesis of the G.I. Joe team. They are often referred to by a phonetic spelling of their organization's initials, as “Siegies” (in the comics). Tomax and Xamot are the commanders of the Crimson Guard.\n\nThe first Crimson Guard figure was released in 1985. The figure wore a red dress uniform with silver decorations and a red helmet with black mask that covered his entire face. The accessories included a rifle with bayonet and red backpack. In 1989, the figure was repainted yellow and gray as part of the special Python Patrol sub group. In 1991, an armored version of the Crimson Guard, known as the Crimson Guard Immortals was introduced, wielding tube rocket launchers and a squad automatic weapon. In 1993, near the end of the original 3 inch G.I. Joe line, lightly armored Crimson Guard Commanders were released.\n\nAfter the relaunch of the \"G.I. Joe\" line in 2001, other incarnations of the Crimson Guard were produced. The first was part of Hasbro's Direct to Consumer line, which featured a slightly redesigned look. Another is a new subset, featuring repaints of the 2005 Crimson Guard Force figures, redone in black and gold, with melee weapons, and named the Crimson Shadow Guard.\n\nAnother notable toy incarnation of the Crimson Guard is the 2004 Operation Crimson Sabotage K.B. Toys Exclusive. The set consisted of three Crimson Guard figures, and included two vehicles; a crimson H.I.S.S. tank (High Speed Sentry), and a crimson A.S.P. (Assault Systems Pod) mobile flak emplacement. Hasbro also released the Crimson Guard for the 25th anniversary toyline. This figure included a G3w/ bayonet, a revolver, a built in holster, and a specially designed backpack.\n\nIn the Marvel and Devil's Due comic series, the Crimson Guard are the most elite soldiers of Cobra's Viper legions, under the direct command of Tomax and Xamot, but completely loyal to Cobra Commander, serving as his personal guard. Building the Crimson Guard network was believed to be the first thing Cobra Commander did after founding Cobra. Crimson Guardsman are not wasted on the battlefield like the more common Vipers and Cobra Troopers. Rather, \"Siegie\" agents operate undercover all over the country, in the political arenas and business world. All Crimson Guardsmen must hold a degree in either law or accounting, and be in top physical condition. They strive to present a facade of exemplary normalcy and civic responsibility, and are provided with fully supported cover identities, and even pre-fabricated \"families\". However, these agents are accumulating financial and political influence for Cobra through every means possible, supporting each other in creating schemes of blackmail, fraud and espionage.\n\nEach member is rigorously trained and inducted in a secret ceremony in the lowest levels of Cobra's headquarters. To be a Crimson Guard is to swear absolute loyalty to Cobra and Cobra Commander. Many members also become part of a \"series\", undergoing plastic surgery and behavior modification to look and act like one another within a series. This allows one series member to completely replace another should the need arise without arousing suspicion. The most commonly depicted is the \"Fred\" Series.\n\nA Fred is assigned early on to spy on Fort Wadsworth, the suspected home of the G.I. Joe. He tends to miss important intelligence by coincidence. This Fred is killed during an attempt by Destro to kill Snake Eyes in his mountain cabin. The Fred who replaces him turns out to be Wade Collins, a soldier who served with Stalker, Snake-Eye and Storm Shadow in Vietnam and believes that he was abandoned by the U.S. Army during the war and by his country afterwards, leading him to join Cobra in a fit of bitterness. Collins eventually decides to leave Cobra and, with help from G.I. Joe, relocates with his family. Collins' son, Kamakura, eventually joins G.I. Joe.\n\nFred VII is one of the noted Guard members. He is an owner of an auto repair shop and a developer of advanced cybernetic and bionic devices. This Fred would gain infamy when, from 1987 to the early 1990s, he would pretend to be Cobra Commander, donning the silver \"battle armor\" that the action figures introduced in the late 1980s. Fred VII's coup is destroyed when the real Cobra Commander made his return.\n\nAnother Guardsman, Appel, is featured in multiple G.I. Joe comic books. He is revealed when Joe forces attack his suburban home. He later comes up with part of the plan that creates Cobra Island. Appel's daughter, Candy, also influences the plot at the same time as she is the romantic interest of Ripcord. At one point, Appel even saves Ripcord from certain death on account of his daughter.\n\nLater, again on Cobra Island, Crimson Guardsmen (with Cobra Trooper backup) are deployed into three sniper teams. They planned to assassinate Serpentor when he arrived with personnel picked up from the town of Springfield. This plan is deduced and the sniper teams are foiled when Serpentor literally hangs onto Cobra Commander, then whips the crowd up into a frenzy of good cheer. They are ordered off their shots for fear of starting a riot.\n\nThe Guard end up on the battlefield during the first Cobra civil war.\n\nAction Force is a series of comics with the Joe characters based out of London. In issue #11, two Crimson Guards, one male and one female, attempt to destroy the Eiffel Tower but are stopped by a Joe team. In the next issue, ten more Guards are captured in a raid on a Cobra base/fast food restaurant. A Guardsman makes a cameo as the co-pilot for Copperhead.\n\nLater, a CG undercover is revealed as working as a school teacher. His uniform is uncovered due to an unlocked door and a curious student named Gary. The CG takes the entire class hostage and shoots dead another teacher. While Footloose does have the man under the sniper rifle crosshairs it is Gary who talks the man into surrendering.\n\nNot all \"Sieges\" remain loyal. An older member, Fletcher, is murdered before he can talk to the United Nations.\n\nA Crimson Guardsman named Agent X-99 is listed as a Cobra operative in the Threat List printed in \"G.I. Joe: America's Elite\" #25. Agent X-99 was first seen in the Sunbow Episode \"The Germ\"\n\nThe flashback series 'Declassified' showcased an early participant in the CG program.\n\nA Crimson Guardsman named Colonel Calvin is featured in an early storyline in \"America's Elite\". He was assigned to a research station in the Amazon, well before the Crimson Twins joined Cobra. Surrounded only by BATs, cut off from support for unknown reasons, he went mad. He decides to make Cobra Commander pay for abandoning him and rigs an ICBM to attack his current location. Somehow Calvin found out about Cobra Commander disguising himself as a member of the US President's cabinet. Duke tracks down Calvin and is held captive by him. Duke breaks free and kills Calvin, but not before finding out about Cobra Commander.\n\nAnother Guardsman is featured in later stories. This particular Guardsman rises through the ranks to the elite Shadow Guard. He is picked from them to become part of The Plague, an elite squad created from Cobra ranks to become an answer to G. I. Joe, and given the codename Infrared. Like the Shadow Guard, the Plague is answerable directly to Cobra Commander. All the Plague members receive biographies in issue 30 of \"America's Elite\". The Joes suspect this Guardsman of being a movie actor.\n\nThese soldiers, which are featured in the cartoon \"\", are the elite of Cobra. As with all soldiers in the first season they fight on land, sea, and air acting almost as officers as well as serving as Cobra Commander's bodyguards. On at least one occasion, Cobra Commander refers to his \"Red Guard\". In the first-season episodes after the \"Pyramid of Darkness\" mini-series, Crimson Guard members also act as deep-cover or sleeper agents, conducting operations in civilian guises that would require either too many operatives or too long an operation time for Zartan to be a feasible agent. In the second season, they seemed to serve more as bodyguards than anything else.\n\nThe Crimson Guard is led by the mirror twins characters Tomax and Xamot, who handle all of Cobra's business affairs. They are in direct command of the Crimson Guard; however, Tomax and Xamot are loyal to Cobra Commander, in turn, putting the Crimson Guard at Cobra Commander's disposal. During the second season, Tomax and Xamot became loyal to Serpentor, which in turn placed the Crimson Guard out of Cobra Commander's disposal and into Serpentor's disposal.\n\nDifferent voice actors have voiced members of the Crimson Guard: Michael Bell, Chris Latta, and Lee Weaver. The Crimson Guard X-99 from \"The Germ\" was voiced by Neil Ross.\n\nIn the \"Dragon Fire\" mini-series of the 1989 \"\" cartoon, their new leader was Destro and some were part of a group of Cobra soldiers who became Python Patrol Crimson Guards and under the newly restored Cobra Commander overthrew Serpentor. Additionally, an undercover Crimson Guardsman infiltrates G.I. Joe as a reporter and is offered a position on the team as war correspondent Scoop. He later learns Cobra lied to him and joins G.I. Joe for real. His Cobra handler, another CG, switches divisions and becomes an Alley Viper. In \"The Greatest Evil\" two-parter, a Crimson Guard Immortal's sister is hospitalized after overdosing on the drug Spark, created by the Headman. This Siegie teams meets Duke whose brother Falcon is also an addict. The two agree to join forces to stop the Headman. Despite his love for his sister, the Siegie gets caught up in Cobra's scheme to use the alliance to rob the Headman of his profits. His sister and Falcon team up to replace the money with worthless paper and then donate the real money to drug rehab programs.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"Brothers of Light,\" the Crimson Guard are homaged as the elite guards for Tomax and Xamot's cult. A brainwashed Duke, Scarlett, and Roadblock were shown as Crimson Guards until Tunnel Rat and Snake Eyes freed them from the mind-control.\n\n"}
{"id": "2152773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152773", "title": "Ukrainian literature", "text": "Ukrainian literature\n\nUkrainian literature is literature written in the Ukrainian language.\n\nUkrainian literature mostly developed under foreign domination over Ukrainian territories. At times Ukrainian language was partly outlawed in oral and print form from 17th to early 21st century. However, foreign rule by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Poland, the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Romania, the Austria-Hungary Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, enriched Ukrainian culture and language, and Ukrainian authors were able to produce a rich literary heritage.\n\nPrior to the establishment of Ukrainian literature in 1700s, many authors from Ukraine wrote in \"scholarly\" languages of middle-ages - Latin and Old-Church Slavonic. Among prominent authors from Ukraine who wrote in Latin and Old-Church Slavonic are Hryhorii Skovoroda, Yuriy Drohobych, Sebastian Klenovych, Stanislav Orikhovsky-Roxolan, Feofan Prokopovych, , and others.\n\nDuring this period of history there was a higher number of elementary schools per population in the Hetmanate than in either neighboring Muscovy or Poland. In the 1740s, of 1,099 settlements within seven regimental districts, as many as 866 had primary schools. The German visitor to the Hetmanate, writing in 1720, commented on how the son of Hetman Danylo Apostol, who had never left Ukraine, was fluent in the Latin, Italian, French, German, Polish and Russian languages\n\nLate 16th and early 17th century included the rise folk epics called \"dumy\". These songs celebrated the activities of the Cossacks and were oral retellings of major Ukrainian historical events in modern Ukrainian language (i.e., not in Old-Church Slavonic). This period produced Ostap Veresai, a renowned minstrel and kobzar from Poltava province, Ukraine.\n\nThe establishment of Ukrainian literature is believed to have been triggered by the publishing of a widely successful poem \"Eneida\" by Ivan Kotliarevsky in 1798, which is one of the first instances of a printed literary work written in modern Ukrainian language. Due to Kotliarevsky's role as the inaugurator of Ukrainian literature, among literary critics he is often referred to as \"the father of Ukrainian literature\". Modern Ukrainian prose was inaugurated by Hryhorii Kvitka-Osnovianenko’s novel Marusya (1834).\n\nAlthough short-lived, a group of young Galician poets and scholars, established in the 1830s and known as the \"Ruthenian Triad,\" played a decisive role in the Western Ukrainian cultural revival of the 19th century. Comprised by Markiian Shashkevych, Yakiv Holovatsky, and Ivan Vahylevych, the \"Ruthenian Triad\" united around itself other young people who began to research Ukrainian history and culture and actively promote the Ukrainian national cause at the Greek Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv. The members of the group maintained that the \"Ruthenians\" of Galicia, Bukovyna, and Transcarpathia were all part of one Ukrainian people who had their own language, culture, and history. The great importance of their literary collection, \"Rusalka Dnistrova\" (\"The Dniester Nymph\", 1836), was in that it was written in the spoken Ukrainian and not in the \"learned\" yazychiie; it thus initiated the use of vernacular Ukrainian language for literature in the Ukrainian lands in the Habsburg Empire. \n\nSince the group came into being during the period of Romanticism, it retained the predominant interests and features of that movement – an interest in folklore and history and a striving for Pan-Slavic unity. Its Slavophilism was noticeable in the use of Old Slavic pseudonyms: Ruslan by Shashkevych, Dalibor by Vahylevych, and Yaroslav by Holovatsky. The group founders as well as other young people united around them were engaged in collecting folk oral literature, studying the history of Ukraine, and writing their own verses and treatises. They emulated the Ukrainians under Russian rule, and were especially influenced by Ivan Kotliarevsky's \"Eneida\" (\"Aeneid\"). Because of their populist and national views, the group members suffered harassment by the conservative Ukrainian clergy and Austrian authorities.\n\nThe first Ukrainian literary and folkloric almanac published in Galicia. It was compiled by the Ruthenian Triad (Markiian Shashkevych, Yakiv Holovatsky, and Ivan Vahylevych) and printed in Buda, Hungary, in December 1836. The almanac consisted of folk songs recorded in various places in Galicia, with an introduction by Vahylevych; poetry and prose by the Triad's members and their translations of Serbian folk poetry; texts of lyrical and heroic poetry from a 15th-century manuscript, with an introduction by Shashkevych; Holovatsky's note on manuscripts in the library of Saint Basil's Monastery in Lviv; and a review of a book of Ukrainian wedding rituals. In the manifesto-like preface Shashkevych stressed the beauty of the Ukrainian vernacular and folk oral literature and provided a list of the most important contemporary publications of literature and folklore in Russian-ruled Ukraine.\n\nTaras Shevchenko and Panteleimon Kulish were the most prominent representatives of the Ukrainian Romantic movement—a movement which, to a large extent, crystallized modern Ukrainian national identity. The extroverted and passionate poet and artist Shevchenko became Ukraine's famous national bard. The introverted intellectual Kulish (Shevchenko's close friend and editor of many of his works) was condemned by most of his populist contemporaries for his controversial works and elitist ideas. However, during the Literary Discussion of 1925, Mykola Khvylovy defended Kulish as Ukraine's 'truly European intellectual.' Learn more about Ukrainian Romantics by visiting the following entries:\n\nTaras Shevchenko, born 9 March 1814 in Moryntsi, Zvenyhorod county, Kiev Governorate, died 10 March 1861 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Ukraine's national bard and famous artist. Born a serf, Shevchenko was orphaned when he was twelve and grew up in poverty and misery. He was taught to read by a village precentor and was often beaten for 'wasting time' on drawing. At the age of 14 he became a houseboy of his owner, P. Engelhardt, and served him in Vilnius (1828–31) and then Saint Petersburg. Engelhardt noticed Shevchenko's artistic talent, and in Saint Petersburg he apprenticed him to the painter V. Shiriaev for four years. Shevchenko spent his free time sketching the statues in the capital's imperial summer gardens. There he met the Ukrainian artist Ivan Soshenko, who introduced him to other compatriots, such as Yevhen Hrebinka and Vasyl Hryhorovych, and to the Russian painter A. Venetsianov. Through these men Shevchenko also met the famous painter and professor Karl Briullov, who donated his portrait of the Russian poet Vasilii Zhukovsky as the prize in a lottery whose proceeds were used to buy Shevchenko's freedom on 5 May 1838.\n\nPanteleimon Kulish, born 8 August 1819 in Voronizh, Chernihiv gubernia, d 14 February 1897 in Motronivka, Chernihiv gubernia. Prominent writer, historian, ethnographer, and translator. He was born into an impoverished Cossack-gentry family. After completing only five years at the Novhorod-Siverskyi gymnasium he enrolled at Kiev University in 1837 but was not allowed to finish his studies because he was not a noble. He obtained a teaching position in Lutske in 1840. There he wrote his first historical novel in Russian Mykhailo Charnyshenko, or Little Russia Eighty Years Ago (2 vols, 1843). Mykhailo Maksymovych promoted Kulish's literary efforts and published several of his early stories. His first longer work written in Ukrainian was the epic poem 'Ukrana' (1843). In 1843–5 Kulish taught in Kiev and studied Ukrainian history and ethnography. There he befriended Taras Shevchenko, Mykola Kostomarov, and Vasyl Bilozersky; their circle later became the nucleus of the secret Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood.\n\nSecret society established in December 1845 – January 1846 in Kiev at the initiative of Mykola Kostomarov. The aim of the society was to transform the social order according to the Christian principles of justice, freedom, equality, and brotherhood. It proposed a series of reforms: (1) abolition of serfdom and equality of rights for all estates, (2) equal opportunity for all Slavic nations to develop their national language and culture, (3) education for the broad masses of the people, and (4) unification of all Slavs in the spirit of the Slavophilism of the time in a federated state in which Ukraine would play a leading role. Kiev was to be the capital of the federation and the seat of the all-Slavic diet. Among others, the following individuals belonged to the brotherhood: Kostomarov, Vasyl Bilozersky, Oleksander Navrotsky, Mykola Hulak, Dmytro Pylchykov, O. Petrov, Panteleimon Kulish, Opanas Markovych, Yurii Andruzky, Ivan Posiada, M. Savych, and Taras Shevchenko.\n\nNikolay Kostomarov, b 16 May 1817 in Yurasivka, Ostrohozke county, Voronezh region, died 1885 in Saint Petersburg. Historian, publicist, and writer. He graduated from the Voronezh gymnasium and then in 1837 from Kharkiv University. From 1844 to 1845 Kostomarov taught history at the Rivne and at the First Kiev gymnasiums. In 1846 he was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Russian History at Kiev University. That year, along with Vasyl Bilozersky, Panteleimon Kulish, Mykola Hulak, Taras Shevchenko, and others, he formed the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood. In \"Knyhy bytiia ukraïns'koho narodu\" (\"Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian People\"), \"Ustav Slov'ians'koho tovarystva sv Kyryla i Metodiia: Holovni idei\" (\"The Statute of the Slavic Society of Saints Cyril and Methodius: Its Main Ideas\"), and two proclamations, Kostomarov formulated the society's program and basic ideas: Christian piety, democratic republicanism, a Ukrainian national renaissance, Ukrainian messianism, and Pan-Slavic federalism.\n\nIvan Nechuy-Levytsky (pseud of Ivan Levytsky), born 1838 in Stebliv, Kaniv county, Kiev Governorate, died 1918 in Kiev. Writer. Upon graduating from the Kiev Theological Academy (1865) he taught Russian language, history, and geography in the Poltava Theological Seminary (1865–66) and, later, in the gymnasiums in Kalisz, Siedlce, and Kishinev. He began writing in 1865, but because of Russian imperial censorship his works appeared only in Galician periodicals. His works about the lives of peasants and laborers established him as a master of Ukrainian classical prose and as the creator of the Ukrainian realist narrative. Nechui-Levytsky was the first to provide fictional characterizations of various classes of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, ranging from students and teachers to high-ranking members of the Russian civil service. Against a background of colonial repression and thoroughgoing Russification Nechui-Levytsky sought to depict the stirrings of national consciousness in the Ukrainian intelligentsia.\n\nPanas Myrny (pseud of Panas Rudchenko), born 1849 in Myrhorod, died 1920 in Poltava. Writer. He worked in various government offices and eventually achieved the rank of full government councilor (1914). The works of Taras Shevchenko had the greatest influence on the formation of Myrny's worldview, artistic preferences, and ideology. His early literary attempts included poems, dramas, and short stories. His best-known work is the novel \"Propashcha syla\" (\"The Ruined Strength\"), also titled \"Khiba revut' voly, iak iasla povni?\" (\"Do the Oxen Bellow, When Their Mangers Are Full?\", 1880). The work can be characterized as a socio-psychological novel-chronicle; it covers almost a hundred years in the history of a Ukrainian village, from serfdom to the postreform era. In it Myrny depicts social oppression, internal strife between different social groups, the tsarist legal system, the harsh life of a soldier during the time of Tsar Nicholas I, police violence, and spontaneous protests against lies and injustice.\n\nBorys Hrinchenko, born 1863 at Vilkhovyi Yar khutir in Kharkiv county, died 1910 in Ospedaletti, Italy. Prominent public figure, educator, writer, folklorist, and linguist. For 10 years he taught in elementary schools in Kharkiv gubernia and Katerynoslav gubernia. In 1894 he settled in Chernihiv, where he organized there the largest publishing house in Russian-ruled Ukraine, which published 50 popular-educational books despite severe censorship. In 1902 he moved to Kiev, where the Hromada of Kiev entrusted him with the task of compiling a dictionary of the Ukrainian language. Hrinchenko's literary work was directly linked with his journalistic work and was to a large extent subservient to it. In his realistic short stories and novelettes he depicted Ukrainian peasant life while raising urgent social questions, the attitude of the intelligentsia to the peasantry, the education and denationalization of the rural population, and the relation between nationalism and radicalism or socialism.\n\nMykhailo Starytsky, born 1840 in Klishchyntsi, Poltava gubernia, died 1904 in Kiev. Writer and theatrical and cultural activist. Orphaned in childhood, Starytsky was raised by his uncle, the father of Mykola Lysenko. He studied at the Poltava gymnasium (until 1856), Kharkiv University (1858–60), and Kiev University (1860–6). Starytsky was first published in 1865. An important part of his literary legacy is his poetry on social issues, which is characterized by populist and patriotic motifs, glorification of the Ukrainian past, and protests against tsarism. Starytsky made a considerable contribution to Ukrainian theater and dramaturgy. In 1883 he headed the first Ukrainian professional theater and in 1885 founded a new troupe with young actors. He wrote several original dramatic works as well as librettos for many of Mykola Lysenko's operas. During the last years of his life Starytsky wrote several historical novels on Ukrainian themes in Russian and Ukrainian.\n\nLike Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko is considered one of Ukraine's most important literary figures. A very prolific writer, poet, publicist, and important political leader, Franko exerted a tremendous influence not only on his native Western Ukraine, but on the Ukrainian culture and national consciousness as a whole. In the last decades of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century he played a key role in the shaping of the powerful Western Ukrainian populist movement and the formation of Ukrainian radicalism. Although he was an ardent proponent of the realist style in literature and art and was consistently critical of modernist trends, Franko himself did not remain immune to new literary currents and produced (in such collections as Withered Leaves, 1896) one of the first modernist poems in Western Ukraine. Learn more about Ivan Franko and his environment by visiting the following entries:\n\nIvan Franko, b 27 August 1856 in Nahuievychi (today Ivan Franko), Drohobych county, Galicia, d 28 May 1916 in Lviv. Writer, scholar, political and civic leader, publicist; like Taras Shevchenko, one of Ukraine's greatest creative geniuses. The son of a village blacksmith, Franko graduated from the Drohobych gymnasium in 1875 and began to study classical philology and Ukrainian language and literature at Lviv University. His first literary works were published in the students' magazine Druh, whose editorial board he joined in 1875. Franko's political and publishing activities and his correspondence with Mykhailo Drahomanov attracted the attention of the police, and in 1877 he was arrested along with Mykhailo Pavlyk, Ostap Terletsky, Andrew Goga, Andrew Mazur and others for spreading socialist propaganda. In 1878 he founded with Pavlyk, the magazine Hromads'kyi druh, which was confiscated by the authorities but resumed publication under the names Dzvin and Molot. In 1880 Franko was arrested again and charged with inciting peasants against the authorities. After serving a three-month term, he was released but was kept under police surveillance and was forced to discontinue his university studies...\n\nA cultural and then political movement initiated in the 1860s by the young Ukrainian intelligentsia in Galicia (known commonly as narodovtsi, or populists). It arose in counterpoint to the clerical conservatism of the older intelligentsia, who had become disillusioned with the possibility of independent Ukrainian national development after the failure of efforts to secure full national emancipation and had begun to orient itself increasingly (both culturally and politically) to Russia. The narodovtsi sought to help Ukrainians better themselves through their own resources. They identified themselves with Ukrainians in the Russian Empire and insisted on the use of vernacular Ukrainian language in literature and education. Their movement, deeply influenced by the writings of Taras Shevchenko, Markiian Shashkevych, Panteleimon Kulish, Mykola Kostomarov, Marko Vovchok, and others, built on the traditions of the Ukrainian national revival of the 1830s and 1840s as represented by the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood in Kiev, the Ruthenian Triad, and the Supreme Ruthenian Council in Lviv...\n\nIn its most general sense radicalism (from the Latin radix 'root') is the striving for fundamental change. Usually the term has a narrower meaning in politics. Although there can be right-wing or nationalist radicalism, the term is more often used in connection with movements on the left of the political spectrum. In the context of Ukrainian history radicalism refers to a brand of agrarian socialism that emerged in Galicia in the late 19th century and survived there until the Second World War. The ideological inspiration for radicalism came from the political thinker Mykhailo Drahomanov and was embodied in the Ukrainian Radical party (est 1890) in Galicia.\n\nMykhailo Pavlyk, b 17 September 1853 in Monastyrske (now part of Kosiv), Kolomyia circle, Galicia, d 26 January 1915 in Lviv. Galician socialist figure and publicist; full member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society from 1900. He and Ivan Franko became close friends as students at Lviv University. Both of them contributed to the Academic Circle's organ, Druh (1874–77), and both became Ukrainophile socialists under the influence of Mykhailo Drahomanov's letters to Druh and the Polish-language newspaper Praca. Through his writings Pavlyk remained the principal Galician propagator of Drahomanov's ideas, which brought about his persecution (he was tried in court nearly 30 times), imprisonment (in 1877, 1878, 1882, 1885–6, and 1889), and ostracism. With Franko he edited (1878) the socialist journal Hromads'kyi druh and miscellanies Dzvin and Molot, all of which outraged the conservative Galician public and were confiscated by the police...\n\nOsyp Makovei, b 23 August 1867 in Yavoriv, Galicia, d 21 August 1925 in Zalishchyky. Writer, journalist, and teacher. He attended Lviv University, from which he graduated in 1893. Varied work as an editorial assistant and a contributor to Dilo (1891), Narodna chasopys' (1892), and other newspapers prepared him for the position of editor of Bukovyna (1895–97). He was also one of the editors of Literaturno-naukovyi vistnyk (1897–99)...\n\nLiteraturno-naukovyi vistnyk (Literary Scientific Herald, or LNV). A monthly journal published in 1898–1906 in Lviv, in 1907–14 and 1917–19 in Kiev, and in 1922–32 again in Lviv. It was founded on the initiative of Mykhailo Hrushevsky as the organ of the Shevchenko Scientific Society (NTSh), incorporating the journals Zoria (published by the NTSh) and \"Zhytie i slovo\" (published by O. Franko). LNV became the foremost literary-scientific journal of the day. The editorial board consisted of Mykhailo Hrushevsky (editor in chief), Ivan Franko, Oleksander Borkovsky, and Osyp Makovei.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century the dominant realist style in Ukrainian literature started to give way to modernism. Some writers no longer aimed for a naturalistic 'copy' of reality, and instead elected an impressionist mode. Along with that change the novelette gave way to the short story. In drama the action passed inward, to explore the psychological conflicts, moods, and experiences of the characters. Poetry abandoned its realistic orientation in favor of the symbolic; emphasis on content gave way to a fascination with form. The work of Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky marks the transition from realism to modernism. Olha Kobylianska, a woman writer contemporary of Kotsiubynsky, was not so much an impressionist in her manner as a neoromantic. The neoromantic tendency in modernism prompted to a rekindling of interest in folklore and resulted in the appearance of a number of remarkable works of literature, including Lesia Ukrainka's play Lisova pisnia (A Forest Song, 1911). The master of the very short impressionistic story was Vasyl Stefanyk. The novelist and dramatist Volodymyr Vynnychenko was deeply interested in the psychological experiences and especially the morality of the intelligentsia... Learn more about the Ukrainian modernist writers of the late 19th century and early 20th century by visiting the following entries:\n\nLesia Ukrainka (pseud of Larysa Kosach-Kvitka), b 25 February 1871 in Zviahel, Volhynia gubernia, d 1 August 1913 in Surami, Georgia. Poet and playwright. Lesia Ukrainka achieved a broad education by self-tuition and knew all of the major Western European languages as well as Greek and Latin and the Slavic languages. She began writing poetry at a very early age. At the age of nine she wrote the poem 'Nadiia' (Hope), and her first published poems appeared in the journal Zoria in Lviv in 1884. Lesia Ukrainka began to write more prolifically from the mid-1880s. Her first collection of original poetry, Na krylakh pisen' (On Wings of Songs), appeared in 1893. However, she reached her literary heights in her poetic dramas. Particularly important among her works are the dramatic poems on the subject of prisoners in Babylon, which were meant to serve as symbols of the imprisonment of Ukrainians within the Russian Empire.\n\nMykhailo Kotsiubynsky, b 17 September 1864 in Vinnytsia, d 25 April 1913 in Kiev. One of the finest Ukrainian writers of the late 19th century and early 20th century. Expelled from the Kamianets-Podilskyi Theological Seminary in 1882 for his Populist involvement, he remained under police surveillance for the rest of his life. A self-taught intellectual, as a young man he was influenced by the works of Taras Shevchenko, Marko Vovchok, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Heinrich Heine, Émile Zola, Victor Hugo, and Guy de Maupassant. His earliest stories are examples of ethnographic realism and show the influence of Ivan Nechui-Levytsky and Populist ideas. In the late 1890s, however, his themes and subjects became more varied and his approach more sophisticated, and he evolved into one of the most talented Ukrainian modernist writers...\n\nVolodymyr Vynnychenko, b 27 July 1880 in the village Velykyi Kut, Yelysavethrad county, Kherson gubernia, d 6 March 1951 in Mougins, France. Writer, statesman, and politician. Vynnychenko began to study law at Kiev University in 1901 but, owing to his expulsion in 1902 for 'revolutionary' activities, he never completed his studies. He was a member of the executive committee of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Workers' party and editor of its journal Borot'ba. In 1917 he was chosen one of two vice-presidents of the Central Rada and then the first president of the General Secretariat of the Central Rada, the autonomous government of Ukraine. Upon disagreeing with the pro-Entente politics of the Directory of the UNR Vynnychenko left for Vienna and finally settled in France where he devoted himself almost exclusively to his literary career...\n\nVasyl Stefanyk, b 14 May 1871 in Rusiv, Sniatyn county, Galicia, d 7 December 1936 in Rusiv. Prose writer. In the course of his studies Stefanyk became acquainted with Les Martovych and Lev Bachynsky, both of whom had an influence on his life: Martovych turned him to writing, and Bachynsky steered him toward community-political involvement. His first attempts to publish some of his introspective poetic prose in newspapers were unsuccessful, but in 1897 the terse narratives of scenes observed by Stefanyk appeared in Pratsia (Chernivtsi); they were followed by several novellas in Literaturno-naukovyi vistnyk (1898) and finally by Stefanyk's first collection of novellas, Synia knyzhechka (The Blue Book, 1899). With its appearance came immediate literary acclaim...\n\nOlha Kobylianska, b 27 November 1863 in Gura Humorului, Bukovyna, d 21 March 1942 in Chernivtsi. A pioneering Ukrainian modernist writer. A self-educated and well-read woman, her first novellen were written in German, beginning in 1880. Her travels and acquaintance with Lesia Ukrainka, Nataliia Kobrynska, Osyp Makovei, Ivan Franko, Vasyl Stefanyk, and Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky changed her cultural and political outlook, and she became involved in the Ukrainian women's movement in Bukovyna and began writing in Ukrainian. Many of her works—including the novels Liudyna (A Person, 1891) and Tsarivna (The Princess, 1895)--have as their protagonists cultured, emancipated women oppressed in a philistine, provincial society. Her works are known for their impressionistic, lyrical descriptions of nature and subtle psychological portrayals...\n\nThe downfall of the Russian Empire after the First World War, the resulting abolition of imperial censorship, the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state (even if for a very short time), and the relative leniency of the Soviet regime in the 1920s all led to an astonishing renaissance of literary and cultural activity in Ukraine. Scores of new writers and poets appeared and formed dozens of literary groups that changed the face of Ukrainian literature. Perhaps the most charismatic cultural leader was Mykola Khvylovy, a prominent writer, publicist, and founder of the elitist literary organization Vaplite. Among Vaplite's members were a renowned playwright Mykola Kulish, a brilliant symbolist poet Pavlo Tychyna, an avant-garde poet and writer Maik Yohansen, and such writers and poets as Yurii Yanovsky, Arkadii Liubchenko, and Mykola Bazhan. However, the Ukrainian cultural renaissance of the 1920s was brutally quashed by Stalinist terror of the 1930s. As a symbolic act of defiance and concern for his nation in the face of the man-made famine and the growing campaign of political terror, Khvylovy committed suicide in May 1933. The majority of Vaplite members, including Kulish and Yohansen, were imprisoned and executed. Others, including Tychyna, were forced to capitulate to the Soviet regime and begin producing works in the socialist-realist style which glorified Joseph Stalin and the Party. Nonetheless, in a very brief time of relative creative freedom, these writers managed to create a remarkable and lasting literary legacy.\n\nMykola Khvylovy, (pen-name of Mykola Fitilyov) b 13 December 1893 in Trostianets, Kharkiv gubernia, d 13 May 1933 in Kharkiv. Prominent Ukrainian writer and publicist of the Ukrainian cultural renaissance of the 1920s. Born Mykola Fitilev, he graduated in 1916 from the Bohodukhiv Gymnasium. In Kharkiv in 1921, with Volodymyr Sosiura and Maik Yohansen, he signed a landmark literary manifesto Our Universal to the Ukrainian Workers and Ukrainian Proletarian Artists. After publishing two poetry collections, he switched to writing prose. Khvylovy experimented boldly in his prose, introducing into the narrative diaries, dialogues with the reader, speculations about the subsequent unfolding of the plot, philosophical musings about the nature of art, and other asides. In his brief period of creativity (less than five years) he masterfully depicted the revolution in Ukraine and the first hints of its degeneration, using a rich gallery of characters, most of them members of the intelligentsia.\n\nVAPLITE (Free Academy of Proletarian Literature). A writers' organization which existed in Kharkiv from 1925 to 1928. While accepting the official requirements of the Communist party, Vaplite adopted an independent position on questions of literary policy and supported Mykola Khvylovy in the Literary Discussion of 1925–8. Vaplite proposed to create a new Ukrainian literature based on the writers in its ranks who strived to perfect their work by assimilating the finest masterpieces of Western European culture. Joseph Stalin interpreted that goal as a betrayal of the aims of the Party and accused Khvylovy and Vaplite of working under the slogan \"Away from Moscow.\" The association rejected the policy of mass participation in masovism proletarian writers' organizations, which were supported by the Communist party.\n\nMykola Kulish, b 18 December 1892 in Chaplynka, Tavriia gubernia, d 3 November 1937 in Sandormokh, Karelia region, Russia. The most famous Ukrainian playwright of the 20th century. After his mother's early death, Kulish spent most of his childhood in orphanages and charity homes. He studied history and philology at Odessa University, but his university education was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. He participated in the Ukrainian Struggle for Independence (1917–20), organizing a guerrilla regiment to fight the Russian Volunteer Army in Southern Ukraine. Kulish had joined the proletarian writers' group Hart in 1924, and after moving to Kharkiv he met many of the group's other members. One of them, the famous writer and polemicist Mykola Khvylovy, had a great impact on Kulish's writing and views. Kulish was also profoundly influenced by Ukraine's leading theater director, Les Kurbas, who staged several of Kulish's plays at his Berezil theater.\n\nMaik Yohansen, () b 28 October 1895 in Kharkiv, d 27 October 1937 in Kiev. Poet, writer, translator, literary theorist, and linguist of German and Ukrainian parentage. Until 1917 he studied philology at Kharkiv University, graduating with a master's degree. Yohansen wrote in German and Russian until 1917, but only in Ukrainian after 1919. Originally a member of the Soviet Ukrainian proletarian writers' organization Hart, in 1925 Yohansen became a founding member of the literary group Vaplite. After the forced dissolution of Vaplite in 1928 by the Soviet authorities, he cofounded and actively contributed to the literary and art periodicals Literaturnyi iarmarok and Universal'nyi zhurnal. He was the only former Vaplite member to question publicly the formation of the more populist literary organization Prolitfront, which he refused to join. Instead he founded the apolitical Techno-Artistic Group A, which was officially banned in 1930.\n\nPavlo Tychyna, b 27 January 1891 in Pisky, Kozelets county, Chernihiv gubernia, d 16 September 1967 in Kiev. Poet; recipient of the highest Soviet awards and orders; deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR from 1938 and its chairman in 1953–9; director of the Institute of Literature of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in 1936–9 and 1941–3; and minister of education of the Ukrainian SSR in 1943–8. He graduated from the Chernihiv Theological Seminary in 1913. He enrolled at the Kiev Commercial Institute, and while a student, he worked on the editorial boards of the newspapers Rada and Svitlo. His first collection of poetry, Soniashni kliarnety (Clarinets of the Sun, 1918; repr 1990), is a programmatic work, in which he created a uniquely Ukrainian form of symbolism and established his own poetic style, known as kliarnetyzm (clarinetism).\n\nThe nucleus of the group of the Ukrainian Neoclassicists of the 1920s consisted of Mykola Zerov, Maksym Rylsky, Pavlo Fylypovych, Mykhailo Drai-Khmara, and Oswald Burghardt (Yurii Klen). They never established a formal organization or program, but they shared cultural and esthetic interests. Mykhailo Mohyliansky, Viktor Petrov, and others are also included in this loose grouping. The group's name is derived from their use of themes and images of antiquity and was given to them by their opponents in the Literary Discussion of 1925–8. The Neoclassicists were self-consciously concerned with the production of high art and disdained 'mass art,' didactic writing, and propagandistic work. Their opponents, in contrast, organized themselves around writers who were supported by the Communist party, and viewed literature in a primarily utilitarian fashion, that is, as a means of strengthening Soviet rule in Ukraine. In the 1930s Mykola Zerov, Pavlo Fylypovych, and Mykhailo Drai-Khmara were sent to Soviet concentration camps and perished there. Maksym Rylsky was forced to publish socialist-realist works, and Burghardt emigrated to the West, where he wrote under the pseudonym Yurii Klen. The tradition of the Neoclassicists was continued among emigre poets, most notably by M. Zerov's brother, Mykhailo Orest.\n\nA literary movement of the 1920s. The works of the Neoclassicists were anti-Romantic and antifolkloric. They sought universal themes and considered Ukrainian culture to be an organic part of Western European culture. The closest to what could be considered their program was set out by Mykola Zerov. 'We should,' he wrote, 'assimilate the highest culture of our times, not only in its latest manifestations, but also in its original forms.' From that commitment stemmed the demands the Neoclassicists made of a writer: (1) a comprehensive knowledge of the best works of Ukrainian literature; (2) a comprehensive knowledge of the achievements of world literature; and (3) poetic craftsmanship of the highest level. High art, in their view, could be conveyed only through clarity of thought and mastery of form. Their poetry, therefore, is characterized by balance, plasticity of image, and logical ordering of subject and composition. The main purpose of literature, as they perceived it, was esthetic.\n\nMykola Zerov, b 26 April 1890 in Zinkiv, Poltava gubernia, d 3 November 1937 in the Solovets Islands. Poet, translator, and literary historian. He studied philology at Kiev University. He was a professor of Ukrainian literature at the Kiev Architectural Institute (1918–20), the Kiev Co-operative Tekhnikum (1923–25), and the Kiev Institute of People's Education (1923–35). Zerov's literary activity, both as a poet and as a translator, was in complete harmony with his ideals and theoretical postulates. An avowed classicist and Parnassian, he became the leader of the Neoclassicists. He concentrated on the sonnet and Alexandrine verse and produced excellent examples of both forms. He translated numerous works of Latin poetry. He wrote literary criticism on contemporary Soviet Ukrainian literary works, articles on literary translation, and introductions to editions of Ukrainian classics. He was arrested in April 1935 and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the Solovets Islands. He was executed on 3 November 1937 in Sandarmokh, Karelia.\n\nMykhailo Drai-Khmara, b 10 October 1889 in Mali Kanivtsi, Poltava gubernia, d 19 January 1939, Kolyma region, Siberia. Poet, linguist, literary scholar, translator. Drai-Khmara studied at the Galagan College (1906–10), Kiev University (1910–15), and Petrograd University (1915–17). He became a specialist in Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Serbian literatures and the history of the Serbian and Belarusian languages. He was professor of Ukrainian studies at Kamianets-Podilskyi Ukrainian State University (1918–21) and at the Kiev Medical Institute (1923–29). He began writing poetry in 1910, and in the 1920s was a member of the Neoclassicists. His early poetry was lyrical, emotive, and essentially symbolist. His later poetry combined symbolist elements with an increasing attention to form, language, and imagery reminiscent of Kievan neoclassicism. He was first arrested in February 1933. Rearrested in September 1935, he was sentenced for 'counterrevolutionary terrorism' in March 1936 and perished in a Kolyma labor camp.\n\nPavlo Fylypovych, b 1 September 1891 in the village of Kaitanivka, Kiev Governorate, d 3 November 1937. Poet and literary scholar. Fylypovych studied at Galagan College and at Kiev University (1910–5), where he later was a professor (1917–35). His first poems were published in Russian journals beginning in 1910. After the Revolution of 1917 Fylypovych switched to writing poetry in Ukrainian. In the 1920s he became a member of the Neoclassicists and published two collections of poetry. Fylypovych was an associate member of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and secretary of its Historical-Literary Society. He made a major contribution to the comparative study of Ukrainian literature, particularly to the study of Taras Shevchenko and Ukrainian romanticism. Fylypovych was arrested in August 1935 during the Stalinist terror, presumably for his critical attitude to official Soviet cultural policies, and sentenced to 10 years in concentration camps. He was executed on 3 November 1937 in Sandarmokh, Karelia.\n\nMaksym Rylsky, b 19 March 1895 in Kiev, d 24 July 1964 in Kiev. Poet, translator, and community activist. He studied at Kiev University, initially in the medical faculty and later in the historical-philological faculty. Rylsky started to write early in life (he published his first poem in 1907), and by 1910 he had published his first youthful collection. His poetic talents reached full bloom with the publication of several poetry collections in the 1920s. Rylsky's lyric poetry grew out of the best achievements of Ukrainian poetry at his time, and out of his broad knowledge of world poetry, French writers in particular. He often used motifs and images from ancient mythology and adhered to classical forms, which practices linked him to the group of Neoclassicists. In many other respects, however, his philosophical and contemplative lyric poetry did not fit the narrow definition of Neoclassicism. Rylsky's apolitical poetry provoked fierce attacks from official critics. He was arrested in 1931, but then proclaimed his acceptance of the official Soviet view of reality.\n\nYurii Klen (pseud of Oswald Burghardt), b 4 October 1891 in Serbynivtsi, Podilia gubernia, d 30 October 1947 in Augsburg, Germany. Writer, poet, literary scholar, and translator. After graduating from Kiev University, he published in Russian a study on the latest analyses of poetic style (1915). Because he was the son of German colonists, he was exiled during the First World War to the Arkhangelsk region of northern Russia. Returning to Ukraine after the Revolution of 1917, he worked as a teacher in Baryshivka. There he renewed his friendship with the scholar and poet Mykola Zerov and began writing poetry in Ukrainian. Klen became one of the unofficial five-member group called the Neoclassicists. Although his poems began to appear in the periodical press beginning in 1924, his major contributions were his translations of German, French, and English poetry. In 1931 Klen managed to emigrate to Germany and taught Slavic literatures at the universities of Munster, Innsbruck, and Prague.\n\nImmediately after World War II, in the second half of the 1940s, Ukrainian literature outside of Soviet Ukraine experienced an unusually intensive period of development in the displaced persons' camps in western Germany and Austria. These camps, which had become home to over 200,000 Ukrainian war refugees, including a significant number of writers and literary scholars, represented a hub of fervent cultural activity, so much so that the period 1945–1949 is often referred to by scholars as the \"minor renaissance\" of Ukrainian literature. Thrown together from various regions of Ukraine, writers managed to replay on a small scale the activity of the 1920s. They convened congresses, organized literary associations, and published almanacs, journals, and books. A key role in the period's most important literary organization, MUR, was played by the linguist, scholar, and literary critic, George Yurii Shevelov and the novelist Ulas Samchuk. Other most notable members of MUR included the dramatist, prose writer, essayist, and publisher Ihor Kostetsky; the writer and scholar Viktor Petrov (V. Domontovych), the politically ambivalent Yurii Kosach, and the poet Vasyl Barka. This \"minor renaissance\" of Ukrainian literature came to an end in the early 1950s as the majority of the authors emigrated to North America and continued their literary work there.\n\nThe artistic Ukrainian movement (Mystetskyi ukrainskyi rukh) was an artistic-literary organization of Ukrainian emigres in Europe. It was founded on 25 September 1945 in Furth, Germany, on the initiative of a committee consisting of Ivan Bahriany, V. Domontovych (Viktor Petrov), Yurii Kosach, Ihor Kostetsky, Ivan Maistrenko, and Yu. Sherekh (George Yurii Shevelov). MUR organized three writers' congresses (1945, 1947, and 1948) as well as three conferences devoted to various aspects of literary activity. The head of the organization during its whole duration was Ulas Samchuk, and its membership numbered 61. The objectives of MUR were to gather Ukrainian writers scattered by the Second World War, to organize the publication of their works, and to become a center for creative dialogues among members representing various styles and literary aims. MUR managed to organize almost all of the noted emigre writers and provide them with a forum for discussion while it stimulated an interest in literature among the public at large.\n\nGeorge Yurii Shevelov (pseud: Yurii Sherekh), b 17 December 1908 in Kharkiv, d 12 April 2002 in New York. Slavic linguist, philologist, essayist, literary historian, and literary critic; full member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society since 1949 and of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1945. After studying under Leonid Bulakhovsky at Kharkiv University (candidate 1939) he lectured there in Slavic linguistics (1939–43). Having emigrated to Germany, he taught at the Ukrainian Free University in Munich (1946–49) and obtained a doctorate there (1949). He was also vice-president of the MUR literary association (1945–49). After settling in the United States he served as lecturer in Russian and Ukrainian at Harvard University (1952–54), associate professor (1954–58) and professor of Slavic philology at Columbia University (1958–77), and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences (1959–61, 1981–6). He was a founding member of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile.\n\nUlas Samchuk, b 20 February 1905 in Derman, Ostrih county, Volhynia gubernia, d 9 July 1987 in Toronto. Writer and journalist. Samchuk was educated at the University of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) and at the Ukrainian Free University in Prague (1931). His literary career began in 1926. He was editor of the Rivne newspaper Volyn' (1941–43), and he fled to Germany in 1944, where he headed the literary-artistic organization MUR (1945–48). He emigrated to Canada after 1948 and became a longtime head of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile. Samchuk's prose is deeply rooted in the 19th-century realist tradition. His novels are broad-canvas chronicles of the Ukrainian experience in the 20th century. Themes progress from the difficult national and cultural nascence in the trilogy Volyn' (Volhynia, 1932, 1935, 1937), the devastating Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932–33 in Mariia (1934), and the Second World War and forced Ukrainian labor in the trilogy Ost (East, 1948, 1957, 1982).\n\nIhor Kostetsky (Kostetzky, Eaghor G.; pen name of Ihor Merzliakov), b 14 May 1913 in Kiev, d 14 June 1983 in Schwaikheim, West Germany. Writer, playwright, translator, critic, and publisher. He grew up in Kiev and Vinnytsia. In the 1930s he studied stage directing and acting in Leningrad and Moscow. A postwar refugee in Germany, he was one of the founders of the writers' association MUR. In the 1950s and 1960s he edited an illustrated journal Ukraina i svit. He and his wife, the German poet Elizabeth Kottmeier, established the Na Hori publishing house in the mid-1950s and, over the period of twenty five years, published several dozen books, including some outstanding editions of the world literary classics in the Ukrainian translation. Kostetsky published prolifically during the late 1940s. His prose works combined traditional and modernist (expressionist, surrealist, dadaist) forms of expression. His experimental plays written in the 1940s anticipated many stylistic devices subsequently mastered by such dramatists as Samuel Beckett.\n\nViktor Petrov(pseud: V. Domontovych, V. Ber), b 22 October 1894 in Katerynoslav (now Dnipro), d 8 June 1969 in Kiev. Writer, literary scholar, archeologist, and ethnographer; member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. A graduate of Kiev University (1918), from 1920 he worked for the Ethnographic Commission of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. During the 1920s he also worked as a literary scholar and writer and was close to the Neoclassicists. In 1941 he was briefly director of the Institute of Ukrainian Folklore of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1944 he fled to the West. As a refugee in postwar Munich he was a professor at the Ukrainian Free University and a member of the editorial boards of the literary and art monthly Arka and the MUR collections. In 1949 he 'reappeared' in the USSR and worked at the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. From 1956 he was a senior associate of the Institute of Archeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in Kiev and the custodian of its scientific archive.\n\nYurii Kosach, b 5 December 1909 in Kiev, d 10 January 1990 in Passaic, New Jersey. Poet, writer, and dramatist; nephew of Lesia Ukrainka. Kosach studied at Warsaw University and in Paris. After the war he lived in displaced persons camps in Germany and was an active member of the writers' organization MUR. In 1949 he immigrated to the United States. While in New York he began publishing a pro-Soviet journal, Za synim obriiem, which was notable primarily for its strident anti-emigre attacks. A prolific author excelling in the genre of the historical novel, he is also the author of several collections of rather average poetry, often marked by his interest in history and mythology. His dramatic works include Obloha (The Siege, 1943)--a dramatic poem—and the tragedy Diistvo pro Iuriia Peremozhtsia (Play about Yurii the Conqueror, 1947). By far the largest and most interesting body of work is Kosach's prose, written prior to his emigration to the United States.\n\nVasyl Barka (pseudonym of Vasyl Ocheret) was born on 16 July 1908 in the village of Solonytsia near Lubni, Poltava Gubernia and died on 11 April 2003 in Liberty, New York State.\n\nHe was a poet, writer, literary critic and translator. An emigre from 1943, he lived in Germany, where he was active in the MUR literary association, before settling in the United States in 1949. Barka's orphic works require intuitive rather than logical comprehension. His poetry developed and grew in stature, from the early lyrical collections to the monumental 4,000-strophe epic novel in verse \"Svidok Dlia Sontsia Shestykrylykh\" (The Witness for the Sun of Seraphims, 1981), addressed to the theme of reconciliation between 'man and the Creator.' His first novel, Rai (Paradise, 1953), deals with the Soviet 'paradise.' His second novel, Zhovtyi kniaz' (The Yellow Prince, 1962, 1968), about the Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932–33 was translated into French (Paris 1981) and served as the basis for Oles Yanchuk's 1993 Ukrainian feature film Holod-33 (Famine-33).\n\nUkrainian writer Iryna Vilde (pseudonym of Daryna Dmytrivna Makohon) was born on 5 May 1907 in Czernowitz (Chernivtsi), Austro-Hungarian monarchy and died on 30 October 1982 in Lviv. Her father was Dmytro Makohon, a lecturer and writer on folk arts. She graduated from Lviv University in 1932. She was married to .\n\nFrom 1930 to 1939 she published short stories and novels about the life of Western Ukrainian intelligentsia, the petty bourgeoisie and students. In 1935 she, for the first time under the pseudonym \"Iryna Vilde\" published the novel \"The Butterflies in high heels\" (Ukrainian \"Meteliki na shpilkah\").\n\nAfter the reunification of Western Ukraine with Ukrainian SSR, she continued to describe the familiar themes of family in bourgeois society. She is the author of many short stories, novellas and novels. Her work contain a huge number of characters – protagonists from all public layers of the then Galicia – of the clergy, employees, workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, as well as information on the activities of various parties and public organizations, the Polish administration policy, the economy, education and the culture.\n\nSome of her work are: The collection of short stories \"Bizarre Heart\" (1936), the story \"Adult Children\" (1939), a collection of lyrical miniatures \"Okrushyny\" (1969), the trilogy \"Butterflies heels\" (2007), novels \"Adult Children\" (1952), \"Sisters Richynski\" (Book 1 – 1958 book 2 – 1964), the trilogy \"Butterflies on hairpins\" (2007). \"Sisters Richynski\" is considered to be her most creative achievement.\n\nSince the late 1980s, and particularly after the independence of Ukraine (1991) and disappearance of Soviet censorship the whole generation of writers emerged: Moysey Fishbein, Yuri Andrukhovych, Serhiy Zhadan, Oksana Zabuzhko, Oleksandr Irvanets, Izdryk, Maria Matios, Ihor Pavlyuk and many others. Many of them are considered to be \"postmodernists\".\n\nAt the same time the post-neoclassical literary trend has grown where the main figures are Igor Kaczurowskyj (d. 2013) and Maksym Strikha.\n\nUkrainian writers include (alphabetically): \n\n\nNach dem Revolution fordern ukrainische Kulturschaffende nun die Reform des Kulturbetriebs und das Ende der ineffizienten kommunistischen Strukturen.\n\n"}

The club have won four top flight league titles for the first time since 1968, City's first Premier League titles. On 21 May 2013, Major League Soccer of the United States announced that its second New York City Metropolitan Area club, to be called New York City FC, would begin play in the 2015 season and majority-owned by Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in association with brothers Hal and Hank Steinbrenner.\n\nMansour was born in the Abu Dhabi emirate on 20 November 1970, the fifth son of the Emir of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. His mother is Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi and he has five full-brothers: Crown Prince Mohammed, Hamdan, Hazza, Tahnoun, and Abdullah. They are known as Bani Fatima or sons of Fatima.\n\nMansour attended Santa Barbara Community College as an English student in 1989. He is a graduate of United Arab Emirates University where he received a bachelor's degree in international affairs in 1993.\n\nIn 1997, Mansour bin Zayed was appointed chairman of the presidential office, which his father Zayed II is the first and by-then president of UAE. After the death of his father, he was appointed by his eldest half brother, Khalifa II, as first minister of presidential affairs of the United Arab Emirates, which is the merger of the presidential office and presidential court. He also served in a number of positions in Abu Dhabi to support his brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nHe was appointed chairman of the ministerial council for services, which is considered a ministerial entity attached to the Cabinet, comprising a number of ministers heading the services departments. Since 2000 he chaired National Center for Documentation and Research. In 2004 reshuffle, he became minister for presidential affairs. In 2005, he became the deputy chairman of the Abu Dhabi education council (ADEC), chairman of the Emirates Foundation, Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority, and Abu Dhabi Fund for Development.

In 2007, he was appointed chairman of Khalifa bin Zayed Charity Foundation.\n\nMansour served as the chairman of First Gulf Bank until 2006, and as a member of the board of trustees of the Zayed charitable and humanitarian foundation. Mansour has established scholarship programs for U.A.E students to study abroad. He is also chairman of the Emirates horse racing authority (EHRA). On 11 May 2009, he was appointed deputy prime minister, retaining his cabinet post of minister of presidential affairs.\n\nMansour heads IPIC, which owns 71% of Aabar Investments and is used as an investment vehicle. After the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal was highlighted and Khadem al-Qubaisi, who was managing IPIC, was arrested in 2016, IPIC was folded into Aabar Investments. Qubaisi blamed Mansour and the UAE authorities for using him as a scapegoat in the affair. Mansour is the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department and Qubaisi is being held in prison without charge.\n\nIn 2005, he was appointed as a member of the Supreme Petroleum Council. In the same year he chaired the board of directors of IPIC and became the board member of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). In 2007, he was appointed chairman of the Emirates Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of UAE.\n\nMansour has a 32% stake in Virgin Galactic after investing $280m in the project through Aabar in July 2009. Aabar also has a 9.1% stake in Daimler after purchasing the stake for $2.7 billion in March 2009 and it was reported that Aabar wishes to increase its stake to 15% in August 2010. He owns the Abu Dhabi Media Investment Corporation (ADMIC) which partnered with British Sky Broadcasting to establish Sky News Arabia – a new Arabic-language news channel headquartered in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. ADMIC also owns the English-language newspaper \"The National\".\n\nMansour is an accomplished horse rider and has won a number of endurance racing tournaments held in the Middle East, and is chairman of the Emirates horse racing authority. He is a strong supporter of Arabian horse racing and the patron of the annual Zayed International Half Marathon competition in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHe is the chairman of the Al Jazira sports company and was a leading figure in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi’s successful bid to host in UAE the FIFA Club World Cup in 2009 and 2010. The company owns Al Jazira Club, which plays football, volleyball, handball and basketball. The football club won the President’s Cup in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.\n\nIn September 2008, Sheikh Mansour acquired Manchester City football club from former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. By September 23, 2008, the Abu Dhabi United Group, backed by Mansour, completed their takeover negotiations and the ownership was transferred to them. He also owns the City Football Group, which was founded in 2014 and consists of Manchester City FC, Melbourne City FC and New York City FC and others. City's ownership was deemed as United Arab Emirates’ attempt to “sportswash” its image and as an instrument of foreign policy by several human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nIn 2014, UEFA found that Mansour’s team breached the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. The club was fined £49 million, while £32 million were suspended. Moreover, City’s Champions League squad for 2014-15 was also reduced to only 21 players. In 2018, the club came under fresh allegations of breach. A German newspaper Der Spiegel wrote a four-chapter story highlighting that Mansour neglected FFP rules and bulked up ‘sponsorship’ deals with his own money. The Emirati provided £59.5 million of a £67.5 million for an agreement signed with Etihad Airways. The report also revealed a £15 million annual deal with an investment firm Aabar, through an internal email sent by executive Simon Pearce in April 2010. The club refused to comment and called it an attempt to damage their reputation was “organised and clear”. City stated that the emails and documents have been obtained illegally. A book called \"Can We Have Our Football Back? How the Premier League Is Ruining Football And What We Can Do About It”, by John Nicholson reportedly claims that Premier League has corrupted football by turning the sport into a money making business. The alleged 'sportswash' campaign run by Mansour's Manchester City is among the several scandals mentioned by John in his book, demanding scrutiny towards them. In May 2019, UEFA opened investigation into Manchester City on allegations that the club misled European soccer’s financial regulators. However, the club still reserved right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In November 2019, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled against Manchester City's attempt to block investigation into breach of financial fair play rules. As per the records published by Court of Arbitration, Manchester City in its appeal to block investigation for FFP claimed damages from UEFA. The club claimed that the alleged leaks by Der Spigel were \"unlawful\" in regards to possible inquiry. However, Yves Leterme dismissed the claims calling them \"groundless\" and \"unacceptable in tone\" In February 2020, Manchester City were banned from UEFA Champions League for two seasons after they were found guilty of violating the financial fair play rule.UEFA in its statement said: \"Manchester City Football Club committed serious breaches of the UEFA club licensing and financial fair play regulations.\" The adjudicatory chamber also informed that the club overstated its sponsorship revenue and used biased calculating methods for the financial accounts submitted between 2012 to 2016. The club responding to the verdict said that it would now approach Court of Arbitration for Sport and initiate proceedings as soon as possible.\n\nMansour married Sheikha Alia bint Mohammed bin Butti Al Hamed in the mid-1990s. Alia is the sister of Abdulla Bin Mohammed Bin Butti Al Hamed. They have one son, Zayed.\n\nIn 2005, Mansour married Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. She is the daughter of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ruler of Dubai. They have two daughters and three sons: Fatima (2006), Mohammed (2007), Hamdan (2011), Latifa (2014) and Rashid (2017)\n\nMansour is the owner of the yacht Topaz.\n\n"}

Its Tudor name was a 'farthingale'.\n\nIt originated as a modest-sized mechanism for holding long skirts away from one's legs, to stay cooler in hot climates and to keep from tripping on the skirt during various activities. Small hoops might be worn by farmers and while working in the garden. Hoops were then adopted as a fashion item, and the size and scale of the hoops grew in grandeur. Especially during the mid-nineteenth century, specifically during the transition from the 1850's to the 1860's. During this time of a newfound society of consumerism, the roles of men and women changed and so did their dress. As male dress became tailored, the female costume of the period made women practically immobilized due to the cumbersome amount of petticoats needed to create the \"full\" look of the era. Thus when the circular crinoline came out in 1856 it was a revelation not only of technology but of convenience for women. By the 1870's the cage of the crinoline became a cage only on the rear of the woman's undergarments. This is known today as a bustle. \n\nHoop skirts typically consist of a fabric petticoat sewn with channels designed to act as casings for stiffening materials, variously rope, osiers, whalebone, steel, or, from the mid-20th century, nylon.\n\nHoop skirts are called by various names in different periods:\n\nLightweight hoop skirts, usually with nylon hoops, are worn today under very full-skirted wedding gowns. They can sometimes be seen in the gothic fashion scene. Reproduction hoop skirts are an essential part of living history costuming, including American Civil War reenactment.\n\n"}

It is the first Black Sabbath album to feature vocalist Tony Martin. It spent six weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, peaking at 168. It was also the last full album of new material by Black Sabbath to be released by Warner Bros. Records (in North America), and the final album through their original label Vertigo Records until the release of \"13\" in 2013.\n\nThe album cover features two models in bronze paint re-enacting Auguste Rodin's 1889 sculpture \"The Eternal Idol\". Due to the paint's toxicity, the models were hospitalized after the shoot. A photograph of the original sculpture was intended as the cover art, but permission could not be secured.\n\nThe sleeve credits Dave Spitz as bass player, but all bass parts were by Bob Daisley. Eric Singer played the drums; the percussion credit for Bev Bevan relates to a few cymbal overdubs on \"Scarlet Pimpernel\".\n\nThe album was originally to be recorded with Spitz and vocalist Ray Gillen. The former was replaced by bassist/lyricist Bob Daisley during initial sessions on Montserrat with producer Jeff Glixman. Gillen had struggled with recording the vocal parts according to Bob, Dave, and Geoff and management wasn't paying him. Gillen quit shortly after their return to England. He later joined the band Badlands. Nightmare was initially written for the third Nightmare on Elm Street movie. \n\nTony Martin was hired and reconstructed the vocals under the guidance of Chris Tsangarides at Battery Studios shortly before production ended. Most tracks were written by Tony Iommi and Bob Daisley (the vinyl version states that all songs were written by Iommi) although some lyrics were modified by Geoff Nicholls. Martin said he \"only sang on, and had no part in writing\" \"The Eternal Idol\", but nonetheless \"thought [it] was one of the better albums of the band.\"\n\nDrummer Bevan and original Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler were hired for a 1987 tour in support of the album, which would have reunited three-quarters of the \"Born Again\" tour line-up (with Martin singing rather than Ian Gillan). However, Butler backed out on learning that Sabbath had booked dates in South Africa. Nicholls played bass for a few shows before Jo Burt was hired. Bevan was subsequently replaced by former Clash drummer Terry Chimes, who appears in the music video for \"The Shining\". (\"The bass player in the 'Shining' video,\" recalled Martin, was some guy that we dragged off the street. I can't remember his name but he looked the part. He said that he was a guitarist. I remember he was always talking about how he was a Red Indian, thus all the turquoise he wore! We never saw him again.\")\n\n\"I'd like to have seen some of the stuff off \"The Eternal Idol\" be a bit more credited,\" Iommi reflected to Sabbath fanzine \"Southern Cross\", \"because I think there's some good tracks on that album – 'Ancient Warrior'…\"\n\nA three-minute and fifteen second studio outtake titled \"Some Kind of Woman\", written by Tony Martin shortly after joining the band, appeared as a b-side of \"The Shining\" single. An early version of \"Black Moon\" – a song destined for \"Headless Cross\" – was released as a b-side of the \"Eternal Idol\" single.\n\nThe album was rereleased on 1 November 2010 in Europe as a two-disc expanded set.

It has transformed old practices in the language classroom and has given origin to self access language learning centers around the world such as the SALC at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan, the ASLLC at The Education University of Hong Kong, the SAC at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and ELSAC at the University of Auckland . As the result of such practices, language teaching is now sometimes seen as the same as language learning, and it has placed the learner in the centre of attention in language learning education in some places.\n\nThere is a comprehensive bibliography for learner autonomy.\n\nThe term \"learner autonomy\" was first coined in 1981 by Henri Holec, the \"father\" of learner autonomy. Many definitions have since been given to the term, depending on the writer, the context, and the level of debate educators have come to. It has been considered as a personal human trait, as a political measure, or as an educational move. This is because autonomy is seen either (or both) as a means or as an end in education.\n\nSome of the most well known definitions in present literature are:\n\nOne of the key aspects to consider in defining Learner Autonomy is whether we view it as a means to an end (learning a foreign language) or as an end in itself (making people autonomous learners). These two options do not exclude each other, both of them can be part of our views towards language learning or learning in general.\n\nLearner autonomy is very useful in learning a new language. It is much more beneficial to learn a language by being exposed to it in comparison to learning patterns of different tenses. In the view of cultural-historical psychology, the development of a students learning skills is never entirely separable from the content of their learning, seeing as learning a new language is quite different to learning any other subject. It is important that the students discover the language for themselves, with only a little guidance from their teacher so that they can fully understand it.\n\nIndependence, autonomy and the ability to control learning experiences has come to play an increasingly important role in language education.\n\nPrinciples of learner autonomy could be:(Frank Lacey)\n\nFor an introduction to learner autonomy, see Reinders (2010) \n\nThere have been numerous studies relating the cognitive factors associated with autonomous learning. The salient characteristics associated with autonomous learning (resourcefulness, initiative, and persistence) are crucial for high school-level students. Currently, the school structure in place in the US is composed of a ladder system of advancement as directed solely by academic achievement. As students proceed up the ladder, they are exposed to ever greater needs for learner autonomy. \nThis increase in learner autonomy does not have a linear incremental increase throughout the 13 grades (from K-12), but shows a dramatic increase in the transition from middle (or junior high) school to high school. Studies suggest that students taught methods for autonomous learning have a greater probability of succeeding in a high school setting. Further, students screened for their level of autonomous learning perform better than those advanced simply on scholarly achievement \n\nAn instrument for assessing learner autonomy may play a significant role in determining a student’s readiness for high school. Such an instrument now exists that is appropriate for the adolescent learner. This instrument is suitable for assessing suitability for greater learner autonomy; a quality that should be present in high school students.\n\nAccording to Philip C. Candy, there are over 100 competencies associated with autonomy in learning. Candy (1991) states that autonomous learners are; \n\n"}

The station is owned by the Spokane Television Group, a subsidiary of Morgan Murphy Media. KXLY-TV's studios are located on West Boone Avenue in Spokane, and its transmitter is located on Mount Spokane. The station's MeTV-affiliated second digital subchannel is also seen in the Yakima–Tri-Cities market on sister stations and fellow ABC affiliates KAPP (channel 35.2) and KVEW (channel 42.2).\n\nOn cable and satellite, KXLY is available in high definition (HD) on Comcast Xfinity channel 104 in the Spokane area, Charter Spectrum channel 1200 in the Coeur d'Alene area and the Palouse, and channel 4 (in both standard and HD) on Dish Network and DirecTV.\n\nThe station is also carried on cable systems in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, both of which are double the size of KXLY's American coverage area. One result of this is that stations in Calgary and Edmonton air American shows on Pacific Time, even though Calgary and Edmonton are both on Mountain Time. It is one of five local Spokane area television stations seen in Canada on the Shaw Direct satellite service. It can also been seen on local cable systems in eastern British Columbia.\n\nAlthough KHQ and KXLY were both granted authorization by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build television stations on July 11, 1952, KXLY was the second to sign on, going on the air with broadcast tests on January 16, 1953, with regular programming beginning on February 22. KXLY had initially hoped to have its television station on the air by Christmas of 1952, but adverse weather conditions on Mount Spokane delayed the launch. It was owned by northwestern broadcast pioneer Ed Craney along with Spokane's oldest radio station, KXLY (AM 920). Just a few months after signing on, Craney sold KXLY-AM-TV to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation.\n\nKXLY-TV was a primary CBS affiliate owing to its sister radio station's long affiliation with CBS Radio sharing ABC with KHQ-TV. Channel 4 also carried some programming from DuMont until as late as April 1955. ABC programming, along with partial DuMont shows that KXLY-TV did not carry, moved to KREM when it signed on in 1954.\n\nAt first, channel 4 enjoyed a good partnership with CBS. The network worked well with early KXLY executives Dick Jones, Bob Struble, and James Agostino to help the station become a dominant player in the Spokane television market in the 1950s and 1960s. Morgan Murphy bought the station in 1961.\n\nHowever, the station's relationship with CBS faltered in later years when it started airing several network shows out of pattern. On February 19, 1976, CBS sent KXLY-TV a \"notice of termination\", with CBS spokesman Barry Richardson stating that the network was ending its 23-year association with KXLY-TV \"because we made a business judgment that we could get wider exposure for our programs with another station\". This would become a rare first in which a major television network would strip a station of its affiliation without first announcing a new affiliate. On August 8, the affiliation switch went into full effect, with CBS programming moving to KREM (KREM wanted to wait until ABC finished airing the network's coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics to make the switch). KXLY then picked up KREM's old ABC affiliation, although it began the transition in February 1976 when it began airing the then-new \"Good Morning America\" while airing CBS shows throughout the day. Ironically at this time, ABC jumped to number one in the ratings for the next several years. This meant KXLY ended up broadcasting the highest-rated networks (first CBS, then ABC) throughout the 1970s. Its radio sister remained with CBS for another 22 years until September 1998, at which time it became an ABC Radio Network affiliate, like its TV cousin.\n\nKXLY-TV is the only station in the Spokane market to broadcast from Mount Spokane, to the northeast of the city. The site (located in a state park) was originally developed with the expectation that Spokane's other TV stations would want to follow suit. When this did not occur, KXLY built a translator (K09FZ on channel 9, later becoming K11VT Channel 11, then KUUP-LP) to serve non-antenna-rotator-equipped households from the mountain ridge south of Spokane used by the other stations. On May 24, 2006, it became KXMN-LP and from September 5, 2006, until the national DTV transition in February 2009, it broadcast MyNetworkTV programming. From the digital transition date forward, the South Hill transmitter rebroadcasts KXLY ABC 4—both in analog on VHF Channel 11 and as 4.1 (ABC HD) and 4.2 (MyNetworkTV/MeTV) over a VHF channel 9 HD digital translator. In June 2017, KXLY-TV added Channel 22, a 15,000 watt fill-in transmitter atop Krell Ridge on Spokane's South Hill. This new digital signal adds stronger service for Spokane's Downtown, Northside, South Hill and Spokane River Valley antenna household locations.\n\nProgramming from MeTV was added on September 3, 2012. KXLY-DT2 stopped carrying MyNetworkTV on October 1 and has since carried MeTV exclusively.\n\nOn March 11, 1999, KXLY-DT signed on the air as Eastern Washington's first digital television signal on VHF Channel 13. Much like the first black and white television broadcasters, this initial effort was launched utilizing a low power digital transmitter and antenna co-located at the Boone Avenue studio location in downtown Spokane. The station's first authentic telecasts began with its 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. newscasts March 26, 1999.\n\nLater behind the scenes that year, engineers assembled the new ABC High Definition satellite equipment to ready the station for ABC's foray into HD with \"Monday Night Football\". By September 27, 1999, KXLY-DT had permanently moved its digital transmissions to the top of Mount Spokane and increased its power to the FCC maximum of 23,300 watts. That evening marked the region's first broadcast of HD pictures with the airing of \"Monday Night Football\".\n\nOn April 20, 2006, the race to HD live local newscasts in the Spokane television market began when KXLY-TV became the first station in Eastern Washington to broadcast a local news segment in HD, an experiment the station continued to explore by showing one pre-taped news segment in HD each Tuesday night during its 6:00 p.m. broadcast until it switched to showing full HD newscasts on August 3, 2008.\n\nOn May 16, 2008, KHQ announced that it would leap ahead of KXLY in becoming the first station to produce HD newscasts beginning August 8, 2008. After months of KHQ marketing this milestone, on August 1, 2008, KXLY shocked KHQ when it made a surprise announcement that starting on August 3, 2008, a mere two days later, it would begin producing all news broadcasts in HD. The date was chosen to beat KHQ to the milestone of being the first station in Eastern Washington to broadcast HD local news.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKXLY-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on February 17, 2009, the original target date when full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 13. Through the use of Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP), digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 4.\n\nKXLY currently clears the entire ABC schedule, as well as local news, paid programming, and syndicated entertainment programming including \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", \"Rachael Ray\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", \"Inside Edition\", and \"Entertainment Tonight\", among others. MeTV programming, simulcast with KXLY-DT2, appears occasionally.\n\nKXLY broadcasts 23 hours of news a week, with a two-hour morning program, \"Good Morning Northwest\", from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., and its evening newscast at 5:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., 6:30 p.m and 11:00 p.m. Unlike most ABC affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone, KXLY does not produce midday news or broadcast Saturday nights at 11:00 pm, leaving the 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. newscasts as KXLY 4's only news offerings on Saturdays.\n\nOn December 22, 2008, KXLY began producing high-resolution weather segments for sister stations KAPP/Yakima and KVEW/Kennewick. Both stations discontinued their 6:00 p.m. newscast, the 11:00 p.m. newscast was reduced to five minutes and weekend newscasts are now produced at KXLY. This includes all weather and sports reports for weekdays and weekends. In addition to this move, 17 employees from KVEW and KAPP, were laid off.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, KXLY switched its logo and title from \"KXLY 4\" to \"4 News Now\". In the move, KXLY received a new studio, replacing the one that was used for 2 decades.\n\n\nKXLY is rebroadcast on the following translator stations:\nTranslators in Montana are located in the Mountain Time Zone.\n\n"}

Their first known occurrence in the fossil record is during the Devonian period, 417–354 million years ago.\n\nThe nymphs (younger stages) go through little or even no metamorphosis, hence they resemble the adult specimens. Their skin is thin, making them appear translucent.\n\nCurrently, no species are listed as being at conservation risk.\n\nThe term Apterygota refers to two separate clades of wingless insects: Archeognatha comprises jumping bristletails, while Zygentoma comprises silverfish and firebrats. The Zygentoma are in the clade Dicondylia with winged insects, a clade that includes all other insects. The group Apterygota is not a clade; it is paraphyletic.\n\nThe primary characteristic of the apterygotes is they are primitively wingless. While some other insects, such as fleas, also lack wings, they nonetheless descended from winged insects but have lost them during the course of evolution. By contrast, the apterygotes are a primitive group of insects that diverged from other ancient orders before wings evolved.\nApterygotes, however, have the demonstrated capacity for directed, aerial gliding descent from heights. It has been suggested by researchers that this evolved gliding mechanism in apterygotes might have provided an evolutionary basis from which winged insects would later evolve the capability for powered flight.\n\nApterygotes also have a number of other primitive features not shared with other insects. Males deposit sperm packages, or spermatophores, rather than fertilizing the female internally. When hatched, the young closely resemble adults and do not undergo any significant metamorphosis, and lack even an identifiable nymphal stage. They continue to molt throughout life, undergoing multiple instars after reaching sexual maturity, whereas all other insects undergo only a single instar when sexually mature.\n\nApterygotes possess small appendages, referred to as \"styli\", on some of their abdominal segments, but play no part in locomotion. They also have long, paired abdominal cerci and a single median, tail-like caudal filament, or telson.\n\nThe composition and classification of Apterygota changed over time. By the mid-20th century, the subclass included four orders (Collembola, Protura, Diplura, and Thysanura). With the advent of a more rigorous cladistic methodology, the subclass was proven paraphyletic. While the first three groups formed a monophyletic group, the Entognatha, distinguished by having mouthparts submerged in a pocket formed by the lateral and ventral parts of the head capsule, the Thysanura (Zygentoma plus Archaeognatha) appeared to be more closely related to winged insects. The most notable synapomorphy proving the monophyly of Thysanura+Pterygota is the absence of intrinsic antennal muscles, which connect the antennomeres in entognaths, myriapods, and crustaceans. For this reason, the whole group is often termed the Amyocerata, meaning \"lacking antennal muscles\".\n\nHowever, the Zygentoma are now considered more closely related to the Pterygota than to the Archaeognatha, thus rendering even the amyocerate apterygotes paraphyletic, and resulting in the dissolution of Thysanura into two separate monophyletic orders.\n\n"}

{"id": "2152853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152853", "title": "Umiak", "text": "Umiak\n\nThe umiak, umialak, umiaq, umiac, oomiac, oomiak, ongiuk, or anyak is a type of open skin boat, used by both Yupik and Inuit, and was originally found in all coastal areas from Siberia to Greenland. First arising in Thule times, it has traditionally been used in summer to move people and possessions to seasonal hunting grounds and for hunting whales and walrus. Although the umiak was usually propelled by oars (women) or paddles (men), sails—sometimes made from seal intestines—were also used, and in the 20th century, outboard motors. Because the umiak has no keel, the sails cannot be used for tacking.\n\nLike the kayak, the traditional umiak was made from a driftwood or whalebone frame pegged and lashed together, sometimes with antlers or ivory, over which walrus or bearded seal skins are stretched. Oil, usually from seals, would be used to coat and waterproof the seams. A large umiak, , would require that about seven skins be sewn together, stretched over the frame and allowed to dry. Modern versions are essentially identical, with the exception of the use of metal bolts and screws.\n\nThe open umiak is significantly larger than the enclosed kayak, which was built to carry one or two men while hunting. Normally , the umiak could be anywhere from and wide. Hans Egede, a Norwegian-Danish Lutheran missionary to Greenland in 1721, stated that he had seen umiaks long.\n\nAlthough an umiak could carry up to 15 passengers, its light weight and lack of a keel allows it to be carried over the drift or shore ice to the open water by a few people. A modern company which trains people to hand make umiaks says that a boat weighs about compared to for a modern vessel.\n\nAlthough the usage of the umiak and the kayak has died out in most areas of the Arctic it is still very much a part of life in the Yupik and Inupiat whaling villages of Alaska. The boat must be hauled on a sled pulled by snowmobile over very rough trails cut through the ice ridges to locations where there are open leads in the ice pack, where it is used to catch whales.\n\nThe skin cover on an umiak will last for two or three years, as does an aluminum boat used in the same way; however, replacing the skin on an umiak is much easier than repairing an aluminum boat. Additionally, the bowhead whale is sensitive to the metallic noise from aluminum boats, and tend to move away under the ice, to avoid them.\n\nIn Utqiaġvik, Alaska, the process for replacing the skin of an umiak begins when the ice moves away from the shores of the Arctic Ocean in July. At their first summer access to the ocean, whaling crews hunt for \"oogruk\", the bearded seal, for suitable skins. The skins are packed into seal oil and allowed to ferment while they are stored until March. At that time the skins are scraped free of hair, sewn together with a waterproof stitch, and then stretched over the wooden frame and tied into place using the sinew from caribou.\n\nWith a new skin on the frame, the umiak is placed out in the wind and cold, to dry. In May when the bowhead whales migrate eastward past Point Barrow, umiak skin boats are hauled on sleds pulled by snowmobiles out onto the ice.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes called a \"woman's boat\", modern Inuit dictionaries such as \"Kangiryuarmiut Uqauhingita Numiktittitdjutingit\" by Ronald Lowe, the \"Inuinnaqtun English Dictionary\", and \"Asuilaak Inuktitut Living Dictionary\" translate umiak as boat, traditional skin boat, or any type of boat.\n\nIn the Eastern Arctic, where the umiak was rarely used for hunting, it was used mainly as summer transport for women and children, while men travelled by kayak, and thus was known as a \"woman's boat\".\n\n\n\n"}

The fashion spread to France and from there to the rest of Europe after c. 1718–1719, when some Spanish dresses had been displayed in Paris. It is also suggested that the pannier originated in Germany or England, having been around since 1710 in England, and appearing in the French court in the last years of Louis XIV’s reign.\n\nThe earlier form of the pannier took the shape similar to a 19th-century crinoline. They were wide and domed in circumference. As they developed, they differed from earlier equivalents such as the farthingale of the late 16th century, by not extending equally in all directions, but being very wide at the sides, but not coming out so far to front and back. By the mid-century, the \"shoulders\" were rather abrupt, not gently curved.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, a woman took up three times as much space as a man and always presented an imposing spectacle. At their most extreme, panniers could extend the skirt several feet at each side.

In 1937 he joined the Reserve of the Netherlands' Luchtvaartafdeeling (Army Aviation Group) – a precursor of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, training on the Fokker S.IV, whilst continuing his medical studies at Utrecht University.\n\nWhen the Netherlands was attacked and invaded by the Third Reich in May 1940, van der Stok – now flying with the Netherlands' Air Force's renamed \"Luchtvaartbrigade\" (\"Army Aviation Brigade\"), scored his first victory when he shot down a \"Luftwaffe\" Messerschmitt Bf 109 whilst on patrol in a Fokker D.XXI over De Kooy airfield, and also took part in an air attack on the Netherlands' Waalhaven Airport, which had been seized by the Germans and was being used by the Luftwaffe for operations.\n\nAfter the Netherlands' defeat and occupation by the \"Wehrmacht\", he made three unsuccessful attempts to follow the Dutch Crown in its withdrawal across the North Sea to England. On the fourth attempt, he managed to reach Scotland in June 1941 as a stowaway aboard the Swiss merchant ship \"Saint Cerque\", which had sailed out of Rotterdam, along with Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and two others. He was awarded the Dutch Bronze Cross by Queen Wilhelmina for his actions.\n\nFollowing a refresher and conversion course with the Royal Air Force's No.57 Operational Training Unit, he was posted to its No.41 Squadron in December 1941 flying the Supermarine Spitfire, with which he went on to achieve six confirmed kills amongst \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft up to April 1942, therewith qualifying as a flying ace.\n\nOn 12 April 1942, during an operation code-named 'Circus 122' over occupied North France to attack the railway marshalling yard at Hazebrouck, van der Stok was shot down whilst flying Spitfire Vb \"BL595\". He parachuted down safely at Saint-Omer in the Pas-de-Calais, but was immediately captured by a Wehrmacht patrol.\n\nHe was subsequently incarcerated in the newly built Stalag Luft III where, with his medical training, he worked in the prison's medical facility. Whilst at Stalag Luft III he made three escape attempts. The first was inadvertently spoiled by another prisoner who drew attention to the escaping van der Stok while retrieving a stolen German cap from the roof of a hut. The second attempt was thwarted when the German guards noticed that a forged pass he was using to get past them was out of date. His third attempt, on the night of 24–25 March 1944, was as a part of the mass break-out later known as \"The Great Escape\", in which he was the eighteenth of 76 prisoners to leave the escape tunnel.\n\nIn his memoir he describes the moment he came out of the tunnel on 24 March, writing: \"Quickly, I climbed up to the surface and immediately found the rope . . . I felt no signal, so it was not safe yet. Then I felt three distinct tugs and slowly popped my head up. The nearest 'Goonbox' was at least 200 feet away; but, indeed, I was twenty feet from the edge of the woods.\"\nAfter the break-out, van der Stok travelled from Breslau train station to Dresden where he was stopped at several checkpoints, convincing the Germans that he was not one of the escapees. He then travelled to Utrecht through Oldenzaal and met up with a member of the Dutch underground, who briefed and equipped him for a bicycle trek to another safe house run by the Belgian Resistance. After arriving there, he was given the paperwork of a Belgian, and then travelled by train via Brussels and Paris to Toulouse, where the French Resistance put him with two American lieutenants, two other RAF pilots, a French officer and a Russian, and took the group across the Pyrenees to Lleida in Spain. The British consulate in Spain accepted the Allied escapees and, three months after the break-out of Stalag Luft III, van der Stok reached British Empire territory once again by arriving in Gibraltar on 8 July 1944. He was subsequently flown from Gibraltar to Whitchurch Airport in England on 11 July 1944.\n\nBack in England, van der Stok rejoined the RAF and was posted to No.41 Squadron flying the Spitfire MK.XII's, going on to fight in Operation Overlord - (10 days after D-Day) and the anti-V-1 fighter aircraft sweeps along the Low Countries coast. In his book \"War Pilot of Orange\", he claims to have downed seven V-1 'Doodlebugs'. The following year, he took command of the Dutch RAF No.322 Squadron, based then on a temporary airstrip at Schijndel in the Netherlands, where, coming into contact with his family for the first time since he had left the Netherlands in 1940, he learned that his two brothers had been killed in concentration camps and his father had been blinded by the Gestapo.\n\nHe was awarded the Order of Orange Nassau from the Netherlands, and was inducted as a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was offered a permanent commission and senior staff rank with the Royal Netherlands Air Force, but declined it and instead resumed and completed his prewar study, qualifying with a degree in medicine from the University of Utrecht in 1951.\n\nHe relocated to the United States with his wife Lucie and their three children, and began practice as an OB-GYN in Syracuse, New York, and as a general practitioner in Ruidoso, New Mexico. He subsequently joined NASA's space lab research team in Huntsville, Alabama. In 1980 he published a war memoir entitled: \"Oorlogsvlieger van Oranje\" (\"War Pilot of Orange\"). In 1987 Van der Stok moved to Honolulu, where he continued in medical practice. He also worked with the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, and took part in 162 rescues.\n\nVan der Stok married Lucia Maria Beata Walter, who died in Santa Barbara, California in 1990.\n\nVan der Stok died at Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA, on 8 February 1993.\n\nIn the 1963 film \"The Great Escape\", elements of his part in the affair were written into the role of \"Sedgwick\", played by the actor James Coburn.\n\nIn 2018, a brooch, awarded to him by the Caterpillar Club to acknowledge his use of an Irvin parachute to bail out of a stricken aircraft, sold for £3226 at auction, beating its estimate of £500-600.\n\nIn February 2019 a new edition of his memoir was published by Greenhill Books, London, with a preface by \"The Times\" journalist Simon Pearson and a foreword by Bram's son Robert Vanderstok.\n\nA C-130 Hercules of the Royal Netherlands Air Force is named after him.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2152894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152894", "title": "Kazan Kremlin", "text": "Kazan Kremlin\n\nThe Kazan Kremlin (; ) is the chief historic citadel of Russia, situated in the city of Kazan. It was built at the behest of Ivan the Terrible on the ruins of the former castle of Kazan khans. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\nThe Kazan Kremlin includes many old buildings, the oldest of which is the Annunciation Cathedral (1554—62), the only 16th-century Russian church to have six piers and five apses. Like many of Kazan's buildings of the period, it is constructed of local pale sandstone rather than of brick. The renowned Pskov architects Postnik Yakovlev and Ivan Shirjay (called Barma) were invited by the Tzar to rebuild the Kazan Kremlin in stone. The cathedral bell tower was erected in five tiers at the urging of Ivan the Terrible and was scored to resemble the Ivan the Great Belltower in Moscow, but was pulled down by the Soviets in 1930.\n\nThe most conspicuous landmark of the Kazan Kremlin is the leaning \"Söyembikä Tower\", which probably goes back to the reign of Peter the Great. A well-known legend connects the tower with the last queen of the Khanate of Kazan. Another recognizable architectural feature is the Spasskaya Tower, which anchors the southern end of the Kremlin and serves as the main entrance to the Kremlin. \n\nThe Spasskaya Tower is named after the Spassky Monastery, which used to be located nearby. Among the monastery's buildings were the Church of St. Nicholas (1560s, four piers) and the Cathedral of the Saviour's Transfiguration (1590s, six piers). They were destroyed by the Communists during Joseph Stalin's rule.\n\nAlso of interest are snow-white towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later renovated; the \"Qol-Şärif mosque\", recently rebuilt inside the citadel; and the \"Governor's House\" (1843—53), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan. The Palace is believed to be located on the site of a former Khan's palace. Tucked between Presidential Palace and Söyembikä Tower is the palace church built on the foundation of a medieval mosque.\n\nThe Northern wall of the Kremlin contains another gated tower, Secret Tower, so named because it used to house a secret water supply well. This tower allows pedestrian access to the Kremlin, but vehicle access is restricted to emergencies only.\n\nThe opening of one of the biggest mosques in Europe, the Qolşärif Mosque, was held in Kazan on June 24, 2005. Roughly 17,000 people gathered for the celebration. Delegations from forty countries attended the event. The facility was reconstructed on the site where presumably Kazan Khanate's principal mosque had been standing before 1552. Speaking at the ceremony, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaeymiev said \"the Qolşärif mosque is a new symbol of Kazan and Tatarstan... a bridge connecting... our past and future.\" \n\nThe decree on restoring the Qolşärif mosque (1995) also ordered the restoration of the Annunciation Cathedral in the Kazan Kremlin which had been taken away from Orthodox Christians after the Russian Revolution. On July 21, 2005, the feast day of the holy icon \"Theotokos of Kazan\", in the presence of the crowd of 10,000 pilgrims, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaeymiev placed at the newly restored Annunciation Cathedral the holiest copy of the long-lost icon, which had been returned to Russia in 2004 by Pope John Paul II shortly before his death.\n\nIn 2005 the first stage of the Kazan Metro also included a station named Kremlyovskaya (or Kreml in Tatar), whose exits are right next to the Kremlin.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2152897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152897", "title": "KQLZ (defunct)", "text": "KQLZ (defunct)\n\nKQLZ (100.3 FM, \"Pirate Radio\") was a radio station in Los Angeles, California, United States that broadcast from March 17, 1989, to April 2, 1993. The station was launched with much attention from both radio and music industry trade publications.\n\nKQLZ was owned by Westwood One, one of the largest producers and distributors of radio programming in the US. KQLZ was one of three radio stations the company purchased in 1989 in an attempt to expand its business to include radio station ownership. Westwood One paid $56 million in early 1989 for what was then KIQQ in Los Angeles, a soft adult contemporary station branded \"K-Lite\". In addition, the company hired noted New York City-based radio programmer and on-air personality Scott Shannon as the new station's program director and morning drive host. The station paid Shannon a then-industry-high yearly salary of $2.3 million. After briefly registering successful ratings during its first six months, KQLZ soon garnered ratings too low to bill advertising rates high enough to sustain operating costs. Shannon was fired on February 13, 1991, and the station tried various format adjustments to help raise advertising revenue. In 1993, Westwood One sold KQLZ at a loss for only $40 million, $16 million less than what the company paid four years earlier. For these reasons, KQLZ is often cited by many in the radio industry as one of the most high-profile failures in the history of commercial radio in the United States.\n\nContrary to its brand management based moniker, the original KQLZ at 100.3 FM was not an actual pirate radio station. The station was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees telecommunications and radio frequency communications in the United States.\n\nIn November 1988, Outlet Communications sold its Los Angeles station, KIQQ, to Westwood One for $56 million. The sale closed March 17, 1989 at midnight Pacific time, and KIQQ officially signed off at 5 a.m. after playing its final song, \"(At) The End (Of A Rainbow)\" by Earl Grant. KQLZ launched with the Guns N' Roses song \"Welcome to the Jungle\", adopting the title as its slogan. Pirate Radio broadcast with no commercial interruptions for its first few days, adding one or two advertisements per hour thereafter.\n\nPirate Radio started as a \"Rock 40\" station that played hard rock and heavy metal music mixed with upbeat pop music and some alternative rock in a manner similar to mainstream top 40 stations. At first, KQLZ featured an eclectic range of music and proudly proclaimed it played everything from Madonna to Metallica to Milli Vanilli. A typical hour of music on Pirate Radio in the spring of 1989 could include early crossover hip hop artist Tone Lōc, electronic music from Depeche Mode, a pop music ballad by Martika, a pop rock song by The Bangles, and satirical punk rock by the Dead Milkmen, all mixed with music from such rock acts as Iron Maiden, Billy Squier, and Winger.\n\nThe station was programmed by Scott Shannon, known within the radio business for his work at WHTZ (Z100) in New York City in the 1980s. Shannon left Z100 and moved to Los Angeles to compete against top-rated station KIIS-FM as well as top 40 crossover outlet KPWR (Power 106). He developed the \"Pirate Radio\" concept while launching WHTZ, drawing inspiration from British pirate radio station Radio Caroline. In addition to Shannon hosting KQLZ's morning drive program, other on-air personalities from the Rock 40 era included Shadow Steele in afternoon drive and Jimmy Page, formerly of KCAQ in Oxnard, in late nights.\n\nThe original Pirate Radio billboards featured a close-up head shot of Shannon's face. Some of these billboards were soon defaced with \"El Diablo\" in spray paint. Local news media reported that some members of the area's Chicano, Hispanic, and Latino communities viewed Shannon's picture as a caricature of the devil. Some media sources reported that the acts of vandalism were done intentionally by the radio station to generate free publicity. In 1990, the station adopted as its mascot the \"Party Pig\", a cartoon pig wearing a trucker hat. This figure replaced Shannon's likeness on billboards and appeared on other promotional items such as T-shirts and bumper stickers.\n\nOne popular feature during KQLZ’s first few months was \"Flush and Win\". The station invited listeners to call in and mention the Los Angeles-area radio station to which they listened before KQLZ signed on. After saying the competing station's moniker or call letters, the sound of a toilet flushing could be heard; this was meant to insinuate that the listener dumped one's former station and switched to Pirate Radio.\n\nBy late 1989, the station focused more on hard rock and heavy metal music (mostly metal in the more pop oriented glam metal genre), putting it in direct competition with metal station KNAC and album-oriented rock (AOR) outlet KLOS.\n\nAlong with its local 100.3 FM broadcast in Los Angeles, KQLZ could also be heard via satellite transmission (SatCom 1R, transponder 3, channels 5 and 6). This service was used primarily for the delivery of the syndicated program \"Pirate Radio U.S.A.\" (see below) to affiliates but it also gave the station wide exposure outside of the local market. Employees of several radio stations around the country listened to and airchecked KQLZ's satellite signal. In 1989, Westwood One had planned to launch a 24-hour satellite version of Pirate Radio; however, a company representative stated that the debut of such a network was unlikely.\n\nOn February 14, 1991, the station switched to a conventional AOR format, dropping pop and dance music. With this change, Shannon and most of the original on-air personalities were dismissed. The following month, Westwood One hired former KLOS program director Carey Curelop for the same position at KQLZ, thus solidifying the switch to AOR.\n\nKQLZ dropped the \"Pirate Radio\" name on December 28, 1992 and adjusted its format to a hybrid of album rock and modern rock. The station from this point forward was known as simply \"100.3 FM\" with the slogan \"Southern California's Cutting Edge\".\n\nOn March 29, 1993, Westwood One announced the sale of KQLZ to Viacom for $40 million; this marked the end of its brief stint in radio station ownership. Four days later, on April 2 at 3 p.m., 100.3 FM flipped to easy listening with new call letters KXEZ (EZ 100.3). Shannon, on the phone from WPLJ in New York, returned to the station's airwaves briefly to give KQLZ a proper send-off, closing out the old format saying, \"Goodbye, Pirate Radio\".\n\nSince then, 100.3 FM has changed formats and call letters several times. In 1996, the station became rhythmic adult contemporary outlet KIBB; in 1997, it flipped to rhythmic oldies KCMG, \"Mega 100\". In 2000, KCMG switched frequencies with urban contemporary KKBT; \"100.3 The Beat\" remained on-air until 2006. That year, the station became urban AC KRBV, \"V 100.3\". From April 8, 2008 until November 16, 2017, the station broadcast rock music as KSWD, \"100.3 The Sound\". Since the sign-off of KSWD, the station has broadcast the Christian adult contemporary music network K-Love with the call letters KKLQ.\n\nPirate Radio U.S.A. was a nationally syndicated program that was produced by KQLZ and distributed by Westwood One. The five-hour show aired on Saturday nights from November 1989 through October 1993, ceasing production several months after the Los Angeles station changed its format. Like the station on which it was based, the program showcased hard rock and heavy metal music. KQLZ afternoon drive DJ Shadow Steele was the original host of \"Pirate Radio U.S.A.\" Following the 1991 departure of Scott Shannon from the station, the show was hosted by Jeff Jensen and later by Jamie Osborne and music journalist Lonn Friend.\n\nOn April 1, 1994, as an April Fools' Day radio stunt, Los Angeles modern rock station KROQ-FM switched to KQLZ's \"Rock 40\" format, complete with original Pirate Radio bumpers, station legal IDs, airchecks, and playlists. Shadow Steele returned to the airwaves for the event, broadcasting live from the KROQ-FM studio.\n\nA tribute website, \"100.3 FM KQLZ Los Angeles, Pirate Radio\", was launched in April 1999 at KQLZ.com.\n\nIn 2001, a fan-produced, commercial-free Internet radio station launched at KQLZ.org. The stream emphasized hard rock and heavy metal as played on the original FM radio station between 1989 and 1991 and adopted much of the imaging. On December 31, 2015, citing rising royalty costs, the KQLZ.org streaming station went off the air.\n\nSince the demise of Pirate Radio, the KQLZ call letters have been used at two other radio stations. From 2008 to 2011, an oldies station in Boise, Idaho (now KPDA) took on the KQLZ call sign, chosen specifically to match its content: the satellite-delivered True Oldies Channel, a later Scott Shannon project. In 2012, KLTQ in Beulah, North Dakota picked up the KQLZ calls. Since 2013, the KQLZ call letters have resided at a station licensed to New England, North Dakota.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2152928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152928", "title": "Archaeognatha", "text": "Archaeognatha\n\nThe Archaeognatha are an order of apterygotes, known by various common names such as jumping bristletails. Among extant insect taxa they are some of the most evolutionarily primitive; they appeared in the Middle Devonian period at about the same time as the arachnids. Specimens that closely resemble extant species have been found as both body and trace fossils (the latter including body imprints and trackways) in strata from the remainder of the Paleozoic Era and more recent periods. For historical reasons an alternative name for the order is Microcoryphia.\n\nUntil the late 20th century the suborders Zygentoma and Archaeognatha comprised the order Thysanura; both orders possess three-pronged tails comprising two lateral cerci and a medial epiproct or \"appendix dorsalis\". Of the three organs, the appendix dorsalis is considerably longer than the two cerci; in this the Archaeognatha differ from the Zygentoma, in which the three organs are subequal in length. In the late 20th century, it was recognized that the order Thysanura was paraphyletic, thus the two suborders were each raised to the status of an independent monophyletic order, with Archaeognatha sister taxon to the Dicondylia, including the Zygentoma.\n\nThe order Archaeognatha is cosmopolitan; it includes roughly 500 species in two families. No species is currently evaluated as being at conservation risk.\n\nArchaeognatha are small insects with elongated bodies and backs that are arched, especially over the thorax. They have three long tail-like structures, of which the lateral two are cerci, while the medial filament, which is longest, is an epiproct. The antennae are flexible. The two large compound eyes meet at the top of the head, and there are three ocelli. The mouthparts are partly retractable, with simple chewing mandibles and long maxillary palps.\n\nArchaeognatha differ from Zygentoma in various ways, such as their relatively small head, their bodies being compressed laterally (from side to side) instead of flattened dorsiventrally, and in their being able to use their tails to spring up to into the air if disturbed. They also are unique among insects in possessing small, articulated \"styli\" on the hind (and sometimes middle) coxae and on sternites 2 to 9, which some authorities consider to be vestigial appendages. They have paired eversible membranous vesicles through which they absorb water.\nFurther unusual features are that the abdominal sternites are each composed of three sclerites, and they cement themselves to the substrate before molting. As in the Zygentoma, the body is covered with readily detached scales, that make the animals difficult to grip and also may protect the exoskeleton from abrasion. The thin exoskeleton offers little protection against dehydration. The animals accordingly must remain in moist air, such as in cool, damp situations under stones or bark.\n\nThe name Archaeognatha is derived from Greek, \"ἀρχαῖος, (archaios)\" meaning ancient and \"γνάθος (gnathos)\" meaning \"jaw\". This refers to the articulation of the mandibles, which have a single phylogenetically primitive condyle each, where all more derived insects have two.\n\nAn alternative name, Microcoryphia, comes from the Greek \"μικρός (mikros)\", meaning \"small\", and \"κορυφή (koryphē)\", which in context means \"head\".\n\nArchaeognatha occur in a wide range of habitats. While most species live in moist soil, others have adapted to chaparral, and even sandy deserts. They feed primarily on algae, but also lichens, mosses, or decaying organic detritus.\n\nDuring courtship, the males spin a thread from the abdomen, attach one end to the substrate, and string packages of sperm (spermatophores) along it. After a series of courtship dances, the female picks up the spermatophores and places them on her ovipositor. She then lays a batch of around 30 eggs in a suitable crevice. The young resemble the adults, and take up to two years to reach sexual maturity, depending on the species and conditions such as temperature and available food.\n\nUnlike most insects, the adults continue to moult after reaching adulthood, and typically mate once at each instar. Archaeognaths may have a total lifespan of up to four years, longer than most larger insects.\n\n"}

Written between 1967 and 1969, it is considered a classic of the genre, and has proven highly influential in shaping subsequent authors' works.\n\nA subsequent trilogy, \"The Chronicles of Castle Brass\" -- consisting of \"Count Brass\", \"The Champion of Garathorm\" and \"The Quest for Tanelorn\" -- expand on the original saga, both deepening its characters (which in the original stories were a bit two-dimensional) and further linking them to the Moorcockian Multiverse.\n\nDorian, in the final pages of the third book, happens to confront (along with other champions like Erekose) the malignant entity which used to reside in Elric's \"Stormbringer\" and which broke free at the tragic end of the albino prince's saga.\n\nThe omnibus has also been published under the title \"Hawkmoon\".\n\nGollancz have announced plans to release all the Hawkmoon stories in both print omnibus and individual ebook form, starting in 2013. The ebooks will be available via Gollancz's SF Gateway site.\n\nGranbretan is a far-future version of Great Britain, ruled by the immortal King-Emperor Huon, who dwells in a fluid-filled sphere in Londra, its capital. The inhabitants of Granbretan are renowned for their cruelty, and for their practice of wearing masks at all times. The Granbretanian aristocracy, and the soldiers they lead, belong to the equivalent of chivalric orders, characterised by a totemic animal. The orders have their own secret languages and their animal-masks make their members resemble bipedal beasts. The post-apocalyptic world depicted, the apocalypse being referred to as the 'Tragic Millenium', has coexisting elements of both 'Medieval' (spears, swords, horse-based transport) and more advanced technology ('flame lances' (laser weapons) and ornithopters (flying machines powered by flapping wings)).\n\nThe geopolitical situation depicted is in fact a curious reversal of that in the Second World War. The future Britain is a brutal empire, bent on the total conquest of Europe, its armies (pouring across a huge bridge spanning the Channel) overwhelming country after country and committing terrible atrocities wherever they come. Conversely, the protagonist Dorian Hawkmoon is a German (though having an English name), originally from Köln, who is exiled by Granbretan's brutal conquest of his homeland but who fights on and rallies the Europeans' resistance to the conquerors.\n\nThe \"terrifying ancient gods of Granbretan who were said to have ruled the land before the Tragic Millennium\" are based on The Beatles: Jhone, Jhorg, Phowl and Rhunga.\n\nYet other gods from the \"tragic millennium\" are based on 20th Century British Prime Ministers (Chirshil, the Howling God (Winston Churchill) and Aral Vilsn, the Roaring God (Harold Wilson), Supreme God) or writers: Bjrin Adass, the Singing God (Brian Aldiss); Jeajee Blad, the Groaning God (J. G. Ballard); Jh'Im Slas, the Weeping God (James Sallis).\n\n\"Aral Vilsn, the Roaring God\" is the \"father of Skvese (\"credit squeeze\") and Blansacredid (\"balance of credit\") the gods of Doom and Chaos\", named after economic terms of the period when the books were written.\n"}

A beautiful woman with black hair thwarts the Justice Inc. team repeatedly. A small strange man seems to be implicated in the scheme. Benson initially finds no chemical explanation for the flames and explosions. He investigates, his aides playing relatively small roles. Benson is betrayed by his paralyzed face and his white hair. The plot is complex: two gangs, each backed by a financier, fight for control of a secret process, discovered by the four scientists, that can turn water into an energy source. The black-haired woman seeks justice for the death of the reporter, her brother, and gets it as Benson causes the gangs destroy one another.

{"id": "2152963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2152963", "title": "Tír na nÓg", "text": "Tír na nÓg\n\nIn Irish mythology Tír na nÓg (; Land of the Young) or Tír na hÓige (Land of Youth) is one of the names for the Celtic Otherworld, or perhaps for a part of it. Tír na nÓg is best known from the tale of Oisín and Niamh.\n\nOther Old Irish names for the Otherworld include Tír Tairngire (Land of Promise/Promised Land), Tír fo Thuinn (Land under the Wave), Mag Mell (Plain of Delight/Delightful Plain), Ildathach (Multicoloured Place), and Emain Ablach (the Isle of Apple Trees). Similar myths in the northern Celtic cultures include these of Annwn, Fairyland, Avalon and Hy Brasil.\n\nTír na nÓg is depicted as an island paradise and supernatural realm of everlasting youth, beauty, health, abundance and joy. Its inhabitants are described as the Tuatha Dé Danann or the warriors of the Tuatha Dé, the gods of pre-Christian Ireland, who engage in poetry, music, entertainment, and the feast of Goibniu, which grants immortality to the participants. In the \"echtrae\" (adventure) and \"immram\" (voyage) tales, various Irish mythical heroes visit Tír na nÓg after a voyage or an invitation from one of its residents. They reach it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by journeying through a mist, by going under water, or by traveling across the sea for three days on an enchanted boat or Manannán's horse. The tales of mortals who visit the Otherworld are referred to as \"echtrai\" (adventures) and \"baili\" (visions, ecstasies). The path across the sea is called Mag Mell (Plain of Honey). It is the golden path made by the sun on the ocean and to travel, \"far over the green meadows of the waters where the horses of Lir have their pastures.\"\n\nThe god that rules this region is said to be the first ancestor of the human race and the god of the dead, and in the surviving tales is almost always named as Manannán mac Lir. In the tales, Manannán is usually described as a warrior and is sometimes accompanied by his golden-haired wife or daughter, who sometimes wears a golden helmet.\n\nTír na nÓg is described as a beautiful place (a forested wilderness or flowery meadow), but it is usually dangerous or hostile to human visitors (such as Ossian, Diarmuid, the Fianna, the King of Greece), who remain on the island for a period of time that is typically a multiple of three (three days or years). The women of Tír na nÓg are very beautiful and sometimes leave to visit mortal men or otherwise are forced to leave to fulfill Manannán's vows. \n\nThere is a salmon-inhabited well or fountain in Tír na nÓg that is found near an enormous tree or grove of nine hazels - or a lady's bower, \"where bloom was on every bough, and the air heavy with the sweetness of orchards.\" Typically an enormous tree lies at the center of the island, and birds singing beautiful music in its branches are stated in the echtrai to be the souls of the dead. A drinking horn suspended near the well or an enchanted cup is also present in some of the tales along with a silver branch containing golden apples (perhaps even somewhere an enchanted herb and a false war). There are cities and fortresses made of precious metals and feather thatch in Tír na nÓg, although their exact number is not clear. In some stories there is a multi-colored flowered plain full of bees in or underneath the forested wilderness of Tír na nÓg and a parting \"is sweet as honey\" and maybe forever.\n\nIn the tale, Oisín (a human hero) and Niamh (a woman of the Otherworld) fall in love. She brings him to Tír na nÓg on a magical horse that can travel over water. After spending what seems to be three years there, Oisín becomes homesick and wants to return to Ireland. Niamh reluctantly lets him return on the magical horse, but warns him never to touch the ground. When he returns, he finds that 300 years have passed in Ireland. Oisín falls from the horse. He instantly becomes elderly, as the years catch up with him, and he quickly dies of old age.\n\nThe story of Oisín and Niamh bears a striking similarity to many other tales, including the Japanese tale of Urashima Tarō. Another version concerns King Herla, a legendary king of the ancient Britons, who visited the Otherworld, only to return some two hundred years later after the lands had been settled by the Anglo-Saxons. The \"Seven Sleepers of Ephesus\", a group of Christian youths who hid inside a cave outside the city of Ephesus around 250, purportedly awoke approximately 180 years later during the reign of Theodosius II.\n\nThere is a king of Tír na nÓg who held the crown for many years. The tradition of the land is that every seven years champions come to run against the king in order to rule. They run up a hill to a throne and the first person to sit on the throne becomes king until a champion replaces him. The king begins to fear that someone else will replace him as king. He visits a Druid and asks about his fate as a monarch. The Druid tells him that he will always be king unless his son-in law runs against him. \nSince the king's daughter is not yet married he decides to use the Druid's magic to turn his daughter's head into the head of a pig. The Druid then tells the king's daughter that she will get her own head back if she marries a son of Finn MacCumhail. The king's daughter finds one of the sons, Oisin, and tells him what the Druid told her. They marry and she transforms back into herself. They then go back to Tír na nÓg and Oisin enters the challenge for the throne. He wins the throne and no one ever runs against him again.\n\nThe princess is given a pig's head and pigs are a common symbol in Irish mythology. For the culture they were a vital meat source and they were smaller and fiercer than the modern domesticated pig. Early in Celtic culture, the pig was used as a funeral animal and pigs were an important aspect of trade between the Celts and Romans. They also represent a connection to the warrior class and are said to be good luck to the person who catches them.\n\nA grey-haired warrior visits King Cormac mac Airt carrying a silver branch with three golden apples that creates a soothing music. The warrior, later revealed to be Manannán mac Lir, is described as wearing a purple fringed mantle, a golden ribbed shirt, and white bronze shoes or sandals. When Cormac asks from what land Manannán has come, he responds that he comes from a land where there is there is no age or decay, falsehood, sadness, gloom, hatred, envy, or haughtiness. Cormac asks to make an alliance, and when Manannán agrees, he demands the branch, which Manannán gives him in exchange for three favors. Those favors later turn out to be Cormac's daughter, his son, and his wife.\n\nAfter Cormac's wife is taken, he follows her abductor, and is magically transported to a land in a heavy mist. The land is described as a vast plain containing two fortresses. The first fortress consists of a bronze wall with a white silver house thatched in white bird's wings; there are horseman stationed there and a man is constantly burning an oak fire. The other fortress consists of four silver houses thatched in white bird's wings with a bronze wall surrounding it. He enters the fortress and finds a palace made with bronze beams and silver wattle. Also in the fortress there is a shining fountain with five streams running from it; the fountain is surrounded by the nine purple hazels of Buan (an Ulster goddess). The hazels drop their nuts into the fountains where five salmon eat them and send their husks down the five streams. The residents of the palace drink water from the fountain, and the sound of the cascading water is more melodious than any music known to man.\n\nWhen Cormac enters the palace, he meets a couple – the warrior who has stolen his wife and a beautiful yellow-haired woman wearing a golden helmet, whose feet are being warmed or washed without anyone else being present. This time the warrior is described as having a beautiful shape, a comely form, and a wondrous countenance. A cook enters the palace with a log, an axe, and a pig, and begins to prepare a meal in a cauldron. Manannán tells the cook to turn the pig, but the cook responds that the pig will not cook until four truths have been told. \n\nThe cook tells his tale first, recounting that he once stole cattle from a man, and when the man asked him to return them, he did so in exchange for the pig, the axe, and the wood he now carries; he has been cooking the same pig ever since. Then the warrior tells a tale of harvesting wheat, indicating that when the people of his land wished to plow, plant, and harvest the wheat, each step had been completed as soon as they desired it, and that they have been eating from that harvest ever since. The woman in the gold helmet then tells her story, saying that she has seven cows and seven sheep, and that the milk and wool they produce is enough for all the people in the Land of Promise. Then Cormac is asked to tell his truth, so he recounts his story with the silver branch up to the present. With the four truths told, the pig is ready and Cormac is served a portion.\n\nCormac says he cannot eat without fifty men in his presence, so the warrior sings a song that puts Cormac to sleep and when he re-awakens, he finds fifty warriors along with his daughter, son, and wife. Then the warrior places an enchanted cup of intricate and unusual workmanship and tells Cormac that when three falsehoods are spoken it will break into three pieces and then when three truths are told, it can mend itself whole. The warrior then tells Cormac that his true name is Manannán son of Ler, and that his whole purpose was to bring him to the Land of Promise, but that after Cormac's death, all that he has returned to Cormac (his son, daughter, wife, and cup) will be returned to the Land of Promise. \n\nManannán then explains what Cormac has witnessed. The horsemen at the first fortress are the “men of art” in Ireland who collect cattle and wealth that pass away into nothing. The man collecting and burning the oak wood is a young lord who pays for everything he consumes. The Fountain is the Fountain of Knowledge, and the five streams are the senses through which knowledge is obtained, and that no one has knowledge who does not drink from the fountain or its streams. Finally, as like the salmon, were the people Cormac saw at the Fountain of Knowledge.\n\nIn the story of the Gilla Decair and His Horse, the Fianna follow the \"Gilla\", a by-name of Manannán, across the sea to retrieve fifteen of their number who were taken to the Gilla's island on the back of his gigantic horse. Finn leads the Fianna to Ben-Edair, where the Tuatha Dé Danann made a solemn oath to the Gaels that if they were ever in a time of need to leave Ireland, ships would be provided. There, they encounter two heroic brothers, who offer to serve the Finn for a year and create a fleet of ships for transporting the Fianna across the sea. Finn and the remaining Fianna travel for three days until they spot an island with a sheer cliff and cylindrical rock perched atop it, where they pick up the Gilla's track. Dermot is then selected to scale the cliff (more slippery than an eel) because of his cowardly behavior and because he was raised on the Isle of Promise by Manannán and also taught by the Dagda's son Angus Og. Embarrassed by the scathing words of Fergus Truelips, Dermot grabs the two staves of Manannán and vaults onto the cliff.\n\nOnce on the island, Dermot encounters a vast sylvan tract of dense forest where he is surrounded by the melodious sound of streams, wind, birds, and bees. In the midst of the forest, he crosses a plain and spots an immense tree with interlacing branches. Beside the tree there is a stone well topped by a pointed drinking horn. The water is pure, so Dermot stoops to drink it, and no sooner does he do so then folderol enters his head and a loud rumbling noise approaches him. When Dermot looks up, he encounters a wizard, who castigates Dermot for roaming through his forest and drinking his pure water. The two men come to blows and fight until dusk, when the wizard dives into the well. Dermot kills and eats a deer that evening, and when he awakes the next morning, the Dermot finds the wizard waiting for him; he upbraids Dermot for eating his deer, then the same episode from the previous day occurs (fighting until dusk when the wizard disappears into the well). On the third day, Dermot grabs onto the wizard when he leaps into the well, and finds himself on the other side.\n\nDermot finds himself in a beautiful and flowery plane facing a regal city. He chases after the wizard through a multitude of people until he crosses through the city gate, and there, the gates are closed behind him, and he is attacked by the people of the city. He fights fiercely until his assailants flee further into the city and out into the forest, leaving Dermot broken in a pool of his own blood. A burly wizard then approaches Dermot and kicks him in the side. The burly wizard tells Dermot that he is in a dangerous place but will transport him to another location where he will sleep much better. The wizard takes Dermot on a long journey to another fortress, where Dermot is greeted by 150 men and their ladies as well as the lady of the fortress, who all greet him by name. At the wizard's fortress, Dermot is placed in an infirmary and completely healed with salves of herbs. Once healed, he engages with the company in feasting, drinking, and intelligent entertainment each night. After three nights, Dermot asks his host in what land he is, and who is in charge of it. The burly wizard tells Dermot he is in \"Tir fo thuinn\" and that the man with whom he battled is the Wizard of the Well who is the king of the land with whom he himself, the Wizard of Chivalry has a blood feud.\n\nGrowing tired of waiting for Dermot, Finn and the Fianna scale the cliff, and on the same plane encounter a horseman who kisses Finn three times and asks the men to follow him to his fortress. There, the Fianna encounter an army and a well-armed keep and are entertained with feasting for three nights. After three days Finn asks about the land and its ruler and is told that he is in the land of Sorcha, and that his host is the king of that land. A female messenger then comes to the King of Sorcha and tells him that his island is being invaded by the Greeks. The Fianna and the King of Sorcha then sally out to meet the Greeks and slaughter them in great carnage. \n\nThe King of Greece has a beautiful daughter who steals off to be with Finn. This upsets the Greek King more than the loss of his men, and declares that whoever can retrieve her will be given many precious things. A captain from his company explains that he has a magic branch that when waved releases beautiful music that will put people to sleep and promises to retrieve the King's daughter. He does so, and the Greeks return to Athens.\n\nThe company splits up and some go to Greece to retrieve the King's daughter, while others meet the King of the Island, the Wizard of the Well, whose name is revealed to be Abartach son of Allchad. When confronted by the Fianna, Abartach asks Finn what he is owed, to which Finn requests single combat. Abartach indicates it is not in his interest to fight Finn, and requests what his wronged Fianna would like. Conán declares he wants fourteen women and Abartach's own wife to ride his horse back to Ireland. Abartach assents to this. The Fianna return to Ireland and have a wedding feast.\n\n"}
