In most applications a coating of less than is applied.\n\nTiN has a Vickers hardness of 1800–2100, a modulus of elasticity of 251 GPa, a thermal expansion coefficient of 9.35 K, and a superconducting transition temperature of 5.6 K.\n\nTiN will oxidize at 800 °C in a normal atmosphere. It is chemically stable at 20 °C, according to laboratory tests, but can be slowly attacked by concentrated acid solutions with rising temperatures.\nDepending on the substrate material and surface finish, TiN will have a coefficient of friction ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 against another TiN surface (non-lubricated). The typical TiN formation has a crystal structure of NaCl-type with a roughly 1:1 stoichiometry; TiN compounds with \"x\" ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 are, however, thermodynamically stable. \n\nTiN becomes superconducting at cryogenic temperatures, with critical temperature up to 6.0 K for single crystals. Superconductivity in thin-film TiN has been studied extensively, with the superconducting properties strongly varying depending on sample preparation, up to complete suppression of superconductivity at a superconductor-insulator transition. A thin film of TiN was chilled to near absolute zero, converting it into the first known superinsulator, with resistance suddenly increasing by a factor of 100,000.\n\nA well-known use for TiN coating is for edge retention and corrosion resistance on machine tooling, such as drill bits and milling cutters, often improving their lifetime by a factor of three or more.\n\nBecause of TiN's metallic gold color, it is used to coat costume jewelry and automotive trim for decorative purposes. TiN is also widely used as a top-layer coating, usually with nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) plated substrates, on consumer plumbing fixtures and door hardware. As a coating it is used in aerospace and military applications and to protect the sliding surfaces of suspension forks of bicycles and motorcycles as well as the shock shafts of radio controlled cars. TiN is non-toxic, meets FDA guidelines and has seen use in medical devices such as scalpel blades and orthopedic bone saw blades where sharpness and edge retention are important. TiN coatings have also been used in implanted prostheses (especially hip replacement implants) and other medical implants.\n\nThough less visible, thin films of TiN are also used in microelectronics, where they serve as a conductive connection between the active device and the metal contacts used to operate the circuit, while acting as a diffusion barrier to block the diffusion of the metal into the silicon. In this context, TiN is classified as a \"barrier metal\" (electrical resistivity ~ 25 µΩ·cm), even though it is clearly a ceramic from the perspective of chemistry or mechanical behavior. Recent chip design in the 45 nm technology and beyond also makes use of TiN as a \"metal\" for improved transistor performance. In combination with gate dielectrics (e.g. HfSiO) that have a higher permittivity compared to standard SiO the gate length can be scaled down with low leakage, higher drive current and the same or better threshold voltage. Additionally, TiN thin films are currently under consideration for coating zirconium alloys for accident-tolerant nuclear fuels. \n\nOwing to their high biostability, TiN layers may also be used as electrodes in bioelectronic applications like in intelligent implants or in-vivo biosensors that have to withstand the severe corrosion caused by body fluids. TiN electrodes have already been applied in the subretinal prosthesis project as well as in biomedical microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS).\n\nThe most common methods of TiN thin film creation are physical vapor deposition (PVD, usually sputter deposition, cathodic arc deposition or electron beam heating) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In both methods, pure titanium is sublimed and reacted with nitrogen in a high-energy, vacuum environment. TiN film may also be produced on Ti workpieces by reactive growth (for example, annealing) in a nitrogen atmosphere. PVD is preferred for steel parts because the deposition temperatures exceeds the austenitizing temperature of steel. TiN layers are also sputtered on a variety of higher melting point materials such as stainless steels, titanium and titanium alloys. Its high Young's modulus (values between 450 and 590 GPa have been reported in the literature ) means that thick coatings tend to flake away, making them much less durable than thin ones. Titanium nitride coatings can also be deposited by thermal spraying whereas TiN powders are produced by nitridation of titanium with nitrogen or ammonia at 1200 °C.\n\nBulk ceramic objects can be fabricated by packing powdered metallic titanium into the desired shape, compressing it to the proper density, then igniting it in an atmosphere of pure nitrogen. The heat released by the chemical reaction between the metal and gas is sufficient to sinter the nitride reaction product into a hard, finished item. See powder metallurgy.\n\nThere are several commercially used variants of TiN that have been developed in the past decade, such as titanium carbon nitride (TiCN), titanium aluminium nitride (TiAlN or AlTiN), and titanium aluminum carbon nitride, which may be used individually or in alternating layers with TiN. These coatings offer similar or superior enhancements in corrosion resistance and hardness, and additional colors ranging from light gray to nearly black, to a dark iridescent bluish-purple depending on the exact process of application. These coatings are becoming common on sporting goods, particularly knives and handguns, where they are used for both cosmetic and functional reasons.\n\nTitanium nitride is also produced intentionally within some steels by judicious addition of titanium to the alloy. TiN forms at very high temperatures because of its very low enthalpy of formation, and even nucleates directly from the melt in secondary steelmaking. It forms discrete, micrometre-sized cubic particles at grain boundaries and triple points, and prevents grain growth by Ostwald ripening up to very high homologous temperatures. Titanium nitride has the lowest solubility product of any metal nitride or carbide in austenite, a useful attribute in microalloyed steel formulas.\n\nOsbornite is a very rare natural form of titanium nitride, found almost exclusively in meteorites.\n"}
{"id": "1835570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835570", "title": "Sight (device)", "text": "Sight (device)\n\nA sight is an aiming device used to assist in visually aligning ranged weapons, surveying instruments or optical illumination equipments with the intended target. Sights can be a simple set or system of markers that have to be aligned together with the target (such as iron sights on firearms), or optical devices that allow the user to see a sometimes optically enhanced (e.g. magnified) image of the target aligned in the same focus with an aiming point (e.g. telescopic sights, reflector sights and holographic sights). There are also sights that project an aiming point (or a \"hot spot\") onto the target itself, such as laser sights and infrared illuminators on some night vision devices.\n\nAt its simplest, a sight typically has two components, front and rear aiming pieces that have to be lined up. Sights such as this can be found on many types of devices including weapons, surveying and measuring instruments, and navigational tools.\n\nOn weapons, these sights are usually formed by rugged metal parts, giving them the name \"iron sights\", as distinct from optical or computing sights. On many types of weapons they are built-in and may be fixed, adjustable, or marked for elevation, windage, target speed, etc. They are also classified in forms of notch (open sight) or aperture (closed sight). These types of sights can require considerable experience and skill, as the user has to hold proper eye position and simultaneously focus on the rear sight, the front sight, and a target, all at different distances, and align all three \"planes of focus\".\n\nOptical sights use optics that give the user an image of an aligned aiming point or pattern (also called a reticle) superimposed at the same focus as the target.\n\nA telescopic sight is an optical telescope equipped with some form of graphic image pattern reticle mounted in an optically appropriate position in the optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are used on a wide range of devices including guns, surveying equipment, and even as sights on larger telescopes (called a finderscope).\n\nAnother type of optical sight is the reflector (or \"\"reflex\"\") sight, a generally non-magnifying optical device that allows the user to look through a glass element and see a reflection of an illuminated aiming point or some other image superimposed on the field of view. These sights have been around for over 100 years and have been used on all types of weapons and devices.\n\nReflector sights were first used as a weapon sight in German aircraft towards the end of World War I. Over the years they became more sophisticated, adding lead computing gyroscopes and electronics (the World War II Gyro gunsight) radar range finding and other flight information in the 1950s and 60s, eventually becoming the modern head-up display.\n\n\nThere are many types of sighting devices. They can be fixed, mechanical, optical, computational, or a mixture of all of these attributes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835579", "title": "Radha Soami", "text": "Radha Soami\n\nRadha Soami, or Radhasoami Satsang, is a religious organization founded by Shiv Dayal Singh in 1861 on Basant Panchami Day in Agra, India. It derives its name from the word \"Radha\" meaning soul and \"Soami\" which refers to \"True God or One God\" as swami of His souls as all souls are created by him.\n\nThe Radhasoamis, states Mark Juergensmeyer, are considered in Punjab as an offshoot of Sikhism, because the teachings of their founder were based, in part, on those of the founder of Sikhism – Guru Nanak and many recite verses from the \"Adi Granth\" during their worship. However, they are also different from the Sikhs because they reject the Sikh idea that there are no present day Gurus beyond their first ten, many reject parts or all of the Khalsa Sikh dress code and rituals such as \"Karah Parshad\". The Radhasoamis are a religious fellowship that accepts saints and living gurus from anywhere. \n\nAccording to Pierluigi Zoccatelli, there were an estimated 3 million Radhasoami followers worldwide in 2004, with many subsects based on the Guru. Of these, the Radha Soami Satsang Beas is the largest and it had 2 million followers. Radhasoami competing subsects have their own headquarters. There are over 30 different Radhasoami groups in the world. The largest group's contemporaneous headquarters are in Beas, with parallel branches found in India and outside India. Other subsects and movements influenced by Radhasoami include Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, Science of Spirituality and others. Some of these groups have tried to distance themselves from the other. Succession upon the death of previous guru has been a source of controversies and schism in the Radhasoami movement since the beginning.\n\nAccording to Mark Juergensmeyer, the term Radhasoami literally refers to Radha as The Soul and \"Soami\" (\"swami\", lord). According to Saligram, quotes Juergensmeyer, these terms are symbolic and mean \"master of energy\", derived from the Vaishnava understanding of \"Radha as the power of energy of God\" (Shakti). It is a referent to the consciousness in a person and the cosmic energy source, states Juergensmeyer.\n\nThe writings of Swami Dayal use the term \"Sat Nam\", rather than Radhasoami. The gurus and the tradition that followed him used the term Radhasoami during the initiation rites, meditation practices and as mutual greeting. This has led to the fellowship being commonly called Radha Soami. In some subtraditions of Radhasoami, states Lucy DuPertuis, the guru's charisma is considered as the \"formless absolute\", being in his presence is equivalent to experiencing the incarnation of the Satguru, the guru is identified as the Radhasoami.\n\nRadhasoami movement was founded by Shiv Dayal Singh in Agra. His parents were followers of Guru Nanak of Sikhism and a local spiritual guru Tulsi Saheb. After completing his education, Singh gained employment as a Persian language translator, left that role and spent increasing amount of his time to religious pursuits. His discourses attracted followers and thus the Radhasoami movement was founded when Swami ji gave initiation to Baba jaimal Singh ji who practised Surat shabad yoga on the bank of river Beas and the Dera Beas was Created.\n\nTo the Radhsoamis, six elements form the framework of their faith:\n\nThe Radha Soami Satsang believes that living gurus are necessary for a guided spiritual life. They do not install the Guru Granth Sahib or any other scriptures in their sanctum, as they consider it ritualistic. Instead, the guru sits in the sanctum with the \"satsang\" (group of Sikh faithfuls) and they listen to preachings from the Adi Granth and sing hymns together. They believe in social equality, forbid caste distinctions and have attracted Dalits to their tradition. They are active outside India, and attracted converts to their movement.\n\nThe Radhasoami are strict vegetarians. They are active in charitable work such as providing free medical services and help to the needy. They do not believe in orthodox Sikh ritual practices such as covering one's head inside the temple or removing shoes, nor do they serve \"karah prasad\" (offering) at the end of prayers. Their basic practices include \"Surat Shabd Yoga\" (sound assisted meditation), initiation of disciple into the path by a living guru, obedience to the guru, a moral life that is defined by abstinence from meat, drugs, alcohol and sex outside marriage. They also believe that \"jivanmukti\" or inner liberation is possible during one's lifetime with guidance of the living guru.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1835584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835584", "title": "Ochnaceae", "text": "Ochnaceae\n\nOchnaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Malpighiales. In the APG III system of classification of flowering plants, Ochnaceae is defined broadly, to include about 550 species, and encompasses what some taxonomists have treated as the separate families Medusagynaceae and Quiinaceae. In a phylogenetic study that was published in 2014, Ochnaceae was recognized in the broad sense, but two works published after APG III have accepted the small families Medusagynaceae and Quiinaceae. These have not been accepted by APG IV (2016).\n\nIn this article, \"Ochnaceae\" will refer to the larger circumscription of the family, which is otherwise known as Ochnaceae sensu lato or as the ochnoids. In this sense the family includes 32 genera with about 550 species.\n\nOchnaceae, defined broadly or narrowly, is pantropical in distribution, with a few species cultivated outside of this range. Ochnaceae is most diverse in the neotropics, with a second center of diversity in tropical Africa. It consists mostly of shrubs and small trees, and, in \"Sauvagesia\", a few herbaceous species. Many are treelets, with a single, erect trunk, but low in height. The Ochnaceae are notable for their unusual leaves. These are usually shiny, with closely spaced, parallel veins, toothed margins, and conspicuous stipules. Most of the species are buzz pollinated. In eight of the genera in tribe Sauvagesieae, the flower changes form after opening, by continued growth of tissue within the flower.\n\nA few species of \"Ochna\" are cultivated as ornamentals. \"Ochna thomasiana\" is probably the most commonly planted, but it is often misidentified in the horticultural literature.\n\nThe leaves of \"Cespedesia\" are sometimes to in length and are used for roofing. An herbal tea is made from the pantropical weed \"Sauvagesia erecta\".\n\nIn its evolution, Ochnaceae has been unusual, in \"reverting\" to character states that are regarded as ancestral or primitive. For example, an actinomorphic floral symmetry has appeared twice in the subfamily Ochnoideae. Also, two clades of Ochnaceae, one in Ochnoideae and another in Quiinoideae have a derived condition very close to apocarpy. The complete separation of the carpels (apocarpy) is thought to be the ancestral state for angiosperms.\n\nFossils attributed to Ochnaceae are known from the early Eocene of Mississippi. The age of the family is very roughly estimated at 100 million years.\n\nA great many genus names have been published in Ochnaceae. In a taxonomic revision of Ochnaceae, as three families, in 2014, only 32 of these genera were accepted; one in Medusagynaceae, four in Quiinaceae, and 27 in Ochnaceae s.s.. In that same year, a 33rd genus, \"Neckia\", was reestablished in order to preserve the monophyly of another genus, \"Sauvagesia\".\n\nThe largest genera in Ochnaceae are: \"Ouratea\" (200 species), \"Ochna\" (85), \"Campylospermum\" (65), \"Sauvagesia\" (39), and \"Quiina\" (34). None of the larger genera has been the subject of a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences of selected genes. In one study of the subfamily Quiinoideae, based on the trn L-F intergenic spacer, only nine species were sampled from this subfamily.\n\nThe following list of 33 genera consists of \"Neckia\", which was resurrected in 2014, plus the 32 genera that were described in the most recent revision of Ochnaceae. The classification is from Schneider et alii (2014).\n\nThe following description is excerpted from the descriptions of Medusagynaceae, Quiinaceae, and Ochnaceae s.s. in \"The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants\", with some information from other sources, as indicated.\n\nMostly shrubs and small trees, plus a few trees of moderate size, and in \"Sauvagesia\", a few herbs.\n\nLeaves simple, except pinnately compound in \"Krukoviella\", and in Quiinoideae, often pinnately lobed or compound on juvenile plants. Pinnate leaves are typical of \"Rhytidanthera\". The leaves are often coriaceous and conspicuously serrate. Stipules present, except \"Medusagyne\".\n\nVenation often scalariform (ladder-like) in appearance, with parallel and closely spaced secondary and tertiary veins. Petioles absent or short, sometimes resembling a pulvinus.\n\nUnisexual flowers are common in \"Medusagyne\" and in Quiinoideae (except \"Froesia\"), but restricted to a clade of three genera in Ochnoideae. Unisexual flowers are found in \"Schuurmansia\", \"Schuurmansiella\", and \"Euthemis\". The flowers are always unisexual in \"Schuurmansiella\".\n\nIn polygamous species, flowers have been assessed as bisexual on the basis of morphology only. Pollen produced by apparently hermaphroditic flowers has, in a few cases, been found to be inaperturate, rendering the flower functionally female.\n\nSepals 3 to 5, often unequal, sometimes accrescent.\n\nPetals 4 or 5, or rarely 3, 6, 7, or 8, often contort, free or fuzed at base only, sometimes reflexed over the sepals.\n\nFertile stamens 5 to 10 or numerous, rarely one. Filaments sometimes persistent, sometimes narrowed near the anthers.\n\nAnthers basifixed or slightly dorsifixed, usually dehiscing by one or two apical or subapical pores, sometimes latrorsely by longitudinal slits. In \"Medusagyne\" and Quiinoideae, an enlarged septum separates the thecae.\n\nStaminodes often present, free or connate, sometimes petaloid, sometimes enveloping the fertile stamens.\n\nNectar not produced. Flowers usually buzz-pollinated.\n\nOvary superior, longitudinally ribbed in \"Medusagyne\" and Quiinoideae; unribbed in Ochnoideae. Carpels completely fused or nearly separate; 2-15, or up to 25 in \"Medusagyne\". Style apical or gynobasic.\n\nFruit sometimes winged; rarely a nut or drupe, often berry-like; usually a septicidal capsule, or else the ovary separating to form blackish drupelets on a usually reddish, accrescent receptacle.\n\nSeeds albuminous or exalbuminous, winged or not. The seed coat often includes a layer of cristarque cells. These are sclereids, each containing calcium oxalate crystals in the form of a druse.\n\nUntil near the end of the 20th century, Ochnaceae was regarded as a rather odd family, difficult to place with a high degree of certainty. Even into the 21st century, some authors treated the genus \"Strasburgeria\" as the closest relative of Ochnaceae, and some even placed it within the family. In the APG III system, \"Strasburgeria\" is grouped with \"Ixerba\" to form the family Strasburgeriaceae in the rosid order Crossosomatales.\n\nMore rarely, the genus \"Diegodendron\" was thought to be close to \"Strasburgeria\" and Ochnaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have strongly supported the inclusion of \"Diegodendron\" in the rosid order Malvales, and it is sometimes treated as a monospecific family therein. Otherwise, it has been placed in Bixaceae, tho there is reason to suspect that it might be closer to Sphaerosepalaceae.\n\nAll of the genera mentioned above, as well as Ochnaceae, were long regarded as anamalous taxa of uncertain affinity. All had been placed, at one time or another, with Ochnaceae, near Theaceae, a family now included in the basal asterid order Ericales.\n\nIn 2012, an analysis of chloroplast DNA resolved Ochnaceae as sister to a group of five families known as the clusioids. This result had only weak bootstrap support. The clusioids were once regarded as a group of four families, but Clusiaceae was divided in 2009 and the name Calophyllaceae was resurrected for one of the resulting segregates.\n\nThere are only a few morphological characters that unite the clusioids with Ochnaceae. The petal aestivation is often contort in the clusioids, and usually so in Ochnaceae. In both groups, the flowers usually bear numerous stamens, and in the ovary, the placentation is mostly axile. In the ovules, the nucellus is often thin, and the outer integument is usually thicker than the inner.\n\nOchnaceae is divided into three subfamilies: Medusagynoideae, Quiinoideae, and Ochnoideae.\n\nA molecular phylogenetic study resolved Medusagynoideae and Quiinoideae as sister subfamilies, but this result had only weak statistical support. In both subfamilies, the flowers are polystemonous. Except for the genus \"Froesia\", many or all of the flowers are unisexual. The anthers contain a massive septum between the thecae that persists after anther dehiscence. The styles radiate outward from the ovary. At anthesis, the ovary is sculpted with longitudinal ribs.\n\nMedusagynoideae consists of a single species, \"Medusagyne oppositifolia\". It is endemic to the island of Mahé in the Seychelles.\n\nQuiinoideae comprises about 48 species in four genera: \"Froesia\", \"Quiina\", \"Touroulia\", and \"Lacunaria\". It is restricted to tropical America. \"Froesia\" is distinct from the other three genera. Its flowers are always bisexual, and the fruit consists of three structures that resemble follicles, except that they are not quite entirely separate from each other.\n\nThe subfamily Ochnoideae was revised in 2014 as Ochnaceae sensu stricto. In that treatment, 27 genera were described. An additional genus, \"Neckia\", was resurrected in that same year, based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study. Amaral and Bittrich (2014) divided Ochnoideae into three tribes: Luxemburgieae, Sauvagesieae, and Ochneae. The genus \"Testulea\" was included in the tribe Sauvagesieae. No subtribes were recognized.\n\nIn 2014, a second reclassification of Ochnoideae was published, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences. In that paper, Schneider et alii divided Ochnoideae into four tribes: Testuleeae, Luxemburgieae, Sauvagesieae, and Ochneae. Their circumscription of the tribes was the same as that of Amaral and Bittrich (2014), except that \"Testulea\" was removed from Sauvagesieae into its own tribe, Testuleeae. Inclusion of \"Testulea\" in Sauvagesieae renders that tribe paraphyletic over Luxemburgieae.\n\n\"Testulea\" consists of a single species, \"Testulea gabonensis\", that is endemic to Gabon. It is unique in Ochnoideae in that its leaves have a brochidodromous pattern of venation and its flowers are tetramerous. In addition, only one of the stamens is fertile. The others are modified into staminodes and united into a column for up to ⁄ of their length.\n\nThe tribe Luxemburgieae consists of two genera: \"Philacra\" and \"Luxemburgia\". \"Philacra\" is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil. \"Luxemburgia\" is from Brazil.\n\nThe tribe Sauvagesieae is pantropical in distribution, and consists of 16 genera, most of them small. The largest, by far, is \"Sauvagesia\", with 38 species, 35 of which are restricted to the neotropics. \"Sauvagesia\" is heterogeneous, and might be paraphyletic, even with \"Neckia\" removed from it. Relationships in the tribe Sauvagesieae are not well understood, and for this reason, it has not been divided into subtribes.\n\nThe tribe Ochneae is found in most of the tropics, but is most abundant in Africa and tropical America. It is distinguished from the rest of Ochnoideae by the absorption of the endosperm before the seed reaches maturity. Its nine genera belong to three subtribes: Lophirinae, Elvasiinae, and Ochninae.\n\nThe subtribe Lophirinae consists of a single genus, \"Lophira\". It has two species, both confined to tropical Africa. It produces an unusual fruit, in which two of the sepals become greatly enlarged and form wings that facilitate seed distribution by wind.\n\nThe subtribe Elvasiinae consists of two genera, \"Perissocarpa\" and \"Elvasia\", both confined to the American tropics. \"Perissocarpa\" has never been sampled for a molecular phylogenetic study.\n\nThe subtribe Ochninae consists of six genera: \"Campylospermum, Ouratea, Idertia, Brackenridgea, Rhabdophyllum,\" and \"Ochna\". The largest of these, \"Ouratea\", is confined to the New World and contains all of the New World species in Ochninae. All of the genera in Ochneae appear to be monophyletic, as defined by Amaral and Bittrich (2014), but in one molecular phylogenetic study, \"Ouratea\" and \"Ochna\" received only weak bootstrap support in the maximum likelihood analysis. \"Idertia\" and \"Brackenridgea\" are probably sister genera, but no other relationships have been resolved among the genera of Ochninae.\n\nThe phylogenetic tree below is adapted from the one that was published in 2014. Weakly supported nodes are collapsed to form polytomies. Maximum likelihood bootstrap support is > 75%, except where indicated. \"Perissocarpa\" and \"Indosinia\" have not been sampled for DNA. Their placement on the phylogenetic tree is based on anatomy and morphology only.\n\nThe evolution of Ochnaceae has been unusual in that it has included two complete reversions to an actinomorphic floral symmetry and two nearly complete reversions to apocarpy, a condition in which the carpels are entirely separate. Actinomorphy and apocarpy are believed to be \"primitive\" character states in angiosperms. Secondary apocarpy is especially rare and has arisen most notably in Rosaceae, Apocynaceae, Sapindales, and Malvales.\n\nThe flowers are actinomorphic in \"Medusagyne\" and Quiinoideae, but in Ochnoideae, zygomorphy is the ancestral condition. In \"Testulea\", \"Philacra\", and \"Luxemburgia\", the flowers develop zygomorphically in the bud. But in the four basal clades of Sauvagesieae, comprising the genera \"Blastemanthus, Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella, Cespedesia, Fleurydora, Poecilandra,\" and \"Wallacea,\" the flowers develop actinomorphically in the bud, then become zygomorphic after opening by growth of certain parts of the flower. Such late zygomorphy is very rare in flowering plants. In the remaining, fifth clade of Sauvagesieae, comprising the genera \"Neckia, Schuurmansia, Schuurmansiella, Euthemis, Tyleria, Adenarake, Indosinia,\" and \"Sauvagesia\", the flowers remain actinomorphic after anthesis. In the tribe Ochneae, all of the species have actinomorphic flowers.\n\nIn the subtribe Ochninae, and in the genus \"Froesia\", the components of the ovary (carpels) are very shortly united at the base. Otherwise, the ovary in Ochnaceae is syncarpous, consisting of carpels that are completely fuzed.\n\nIn \"Medusagyne\" and Quiinoideae, many of the flowers are unisexual, except in \"Froesia\", where they are strictly hermaphrodite. In Ochnoideae, unisexual flowers are limited to a clade consisting of \"Schuurmansia\", \"Schuurmansiella\", and \"Euthemis\".\n\nIn \"Medusagyne\" and Quiinoideae, as in most angiosperms, the anthers open by longitudinal slits. In Ochnoideeae, the anther dehiscence is ancestrally poricidal, with several reversions to longitudinal slits. \"Testulea\", \"Philacra\", and \"Luxemburgia\" have anthers that open by apical pores. So do the three most basal clades of Sauvagesieae, namely \"Blastemanthus\", \"Fleurydora\", and a clade of four genera that have five carpels and many ovules per carpel (\"Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella\", and \"Cespedesia\"). \"Poecilandra\" has poricidal anther dehiscence, but in its sister genus, \"Wallacea\", the anthers open by longitudinal slits.\n\nIn the rest of Sauvagesieae, anther dehiscence is various. In \"Schuurmansia\", \"Schuurmansiella\", and \"Adenarake\", the anther dehiscence is apically longicidal. This means that the longitudinal slit is short, and does not extend far from the apical end of the anther. In some species of \"Sauvagesia\", the anthers split lengthwise, but the entire androecium is wrapped in petaloid staminodes, so that the pollen can escape from only the apex of the anther. This is known as a poricidal system because it functions as if the anthers were truly poricidal.\n\nIn the tribe Ochneae, anther dehiscence by longitudinal slits is restricted to \"Brackenridgea\" and a few species of \"Ochna\".\n\n\"Testulea\" is peculiar in having only one fertile stamen. Its anther opens by an apical pore. The other stamens are modified into sterile staminodes that are fuzed into a column for up to ⁄ of their length.\n\nIn the genera \"Froesia\" and \"Quiina\", and in the tribe Ochneae, the endosperm is completely absorbed early in seed development. It is not clear whether the presence or absence of endosperm is the ancestral state in Ochnaceae. For a long time, the subfamily Ochnoideae was divided into two groups based on this character alone. In such a classification, the group containing endosperm would be paraphyletic over Ochneae because it would contain \"Testulea\", \"Philacra\", and \"Luxemburgia\".\n\nThe number of ovules per carpel varies widely in Ochnaceae. \"Medusagyne\" and Quiinoideae have two ovules per carpel. In \"Testulea\" and in a clade of four genera in Sauvagesieae (\"Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella\", and \"Cespedesia\"), the number of ovules is 100 to 200 per carpel. For the remainder of Sauvagesieae, except \"Euthemis\", and for \"Philacra\" and \"Luxemburgia\", the number of ovules per carpel ranges from four to 50. \"Euthemis\" has two ovules per carpel.\n\nIn Ochneae, \"Lophira\" has 4 to 50 ovules per carpel. In the subtribes Elvasiinae and Ochninae, the number of ovules per carpel is one.\n\nThe family Ochnaceae was erected by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1811. At that time, he described \"Elvasia\", a new genus in the family, and he included three others: \"Ochna\", \"Walkera\", and \"Gomphia\". \"Walkera\" was described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1789, but is no longer recognized. Its type species was described as \"Gomphia serrata\" by Andrias Kanis in 1968, but it is now placed in the genus \"Campylospermum\". \"Gomphia\" has long been a source of confusion and it was not recognized in the most recent revision of Ochnaceae.\n\n\"Godoya\" and \"Sauvagesia\" were known in 1811, when de Candolle erected the family Ochnaceae, but he placed them in other families. In his \"Prodromus\", he placed \"Godoya\" in the family that would later be known as Clusiaceae. He regarded \"Lauradia\" (\"Lavradia\") as separate from \"Sauvagesia\", and placed both of them in Violaceae. He added the genus \"Castela\" to Ochnaceae, but it is now part of Simaroubaceae. De Candolle believed that Simaroubaceae was closely related to Ochnaceae, but it is now placed in the order Sapindales. A few authors placed \"Godoya\", \"Sauvagesia\", and others in the family Sauvagesiaceae, until the beginning of the 21st century. Other authors, such as Adolf Engler, included them in Ochnaceae.\n\nIn 1874, Engler divided Ochnaceae into two groups, based on the absence or presence of endosperm in the mature seed. The group without endosperm corresponds to de Candolle's concept of Ochnaceae, and to the modern tribe Ochneae. The group with endosperm is now known to be paraphyletic and consists of the tribes Testuleeae, Luxemburgieae, and Sauvagesieae. In 1876, in a flora of Brazil, Engler described many new species in Ochnaceae, especially in its largest genus, \"Ouratea\". He described 85 species in \"Ouratea\", 17 of which he named as new species at that time. He also transferred 63 species to \"Ouratea\" from other genera.\n\nThe genera \"Quiina\" and \"Touroulia\" had been known since 1775, when they were described by Jean Baptiste Aublet, and they were variously classified by 19th century taxonomists. Jacques Denys Choisy erected the family Quiinaceae (as Quiinacées) for them in 1849, but he did not meet the requirements for valid publication of a botanical name. The name Quiinaceae was validated by Engler in Flora Brasiliensis in 1888.\n\nThe genus \"Medusagyne\" had been described by John Gilbert Baker in 1877, in a flora of Mauritius and the Seychelles, but it was not until 1924 that it was segregated into its own monogeneric family.\n\nIn 1893, Ernest Friedrich Gilg covered Ochnaceae, and Adolf Engler covered Quiinaceae for the first edition of Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien. Engler wrote a description of \"Medusagyne\" in a supplement to the first edition of \"DNP\" in 1897. He placed \"Medusagyne\" under the heading \"Zweifelhafte, möglicherweise zu den Guttiferae gehörige Gattung\" (Doubtful, possibly a genus belonging to Guttiferae). Guttiferae is an obsolete name for Clusiaceae.\n\nIn 1902, Philippe van Tieghem recognized six families in what is now the subfamily Ochnoideae. These were Luxemburgiaceae, Sauvagesiaceae, Wallaceaceae, Euthemidaceae, Lophiraceae, and Ochnaceae. Three of these, (Wallaceaceae, Euthemidaceae, and Lophiraceae) were monogeneric and were erected by van Tieghem at that time. His Luxemburgiaceae included the basal clades of what is now the tribe Sauvagesieae. Van Tieghem named a great many genera in 1902, circumscribing them very narrowly. In what is now the subtribe Ochninae, he delineated 53 genera. The most recent revision of that group divides it into six genera.\n\nIn 1925, for the second edition of \"DNP\", Engler and Gilg expanded on their treatment of Quiinaceae and Ochnaceae, respectively, compared to what they had written in 1893. Medusagynaceae was covered in the same volume of \"DNP\" by Adolf Engler and Hans Melchior.\n\nFor the second edition of \"DNP\", Engler recognized two genera, \"Quiina\" and \"Touroulia\", in Quiinaceae. \"Lacunaria\" and \"Froesia\" were discovered later and named in 1925 and 1948, respectively.\n\nIn that same volume, Gilg divided his Ochnaceae (equivalent to modern Ochnoideae) into 21 genera, including \"Indovethia, Leitgebia, Vausagesia,\" and \"Lauradia\" (as \"Lavradia\"), which are now regarded as synonyms of \"Sauvagesia\". Eight of the modern genera, (\"Philacra, Krukoviella, Fleurydora, Tyleria, Adenarake, Indosinia, Perissocarpa,\" and \"Idertia\") consist of plants that had not been uncovered by botanical exploration at that time. Gilg placed \"Rhytidanthera\" in synonymy under \"Godoya\", but \"Rhytidanthera\" is accepted today. He included \"Campylospermum\" and \"Rhabdophyllum\" in \"Gomphia\" and placed \"Gomphia\" in synonymy under \"Ouratea\". In his revision of Ochnaceae, Gilg provided a summary of van Tieghem's classification, as well as his own. Three of van Tieghem's genera, (\"Campylospermum\", \"Rhabdophyllum\", and \"Rhytidanthera\") are still recognized today.\n\nIn 1968, Andrias Kanis published a paper that greatly influenced subsequent work in Ochnaceae, right up to the 2014 revision. Claude H.L. Sastre named many new species in Ochnaceae, in several papers from 1970 to 2003.\n\nIn 1991, a cladistic analysis was published for Ochnaceae. In that same year, \"Neckia\", a 28th genus for Ochnoideae, was resurrected in a molecular phylogenetic study based on four chloroplast DNA loci, and nuclear ribosomal ITS. Seventy-nine species of Ochnaceae were sampled and a new classification was presented. Also, \"Testulea\" was removed from the tribe Sauvagesieae, and placed in the monotypic tribe Testuleeae.\n\n"}

The band consists of Rick Miller, Dave Hartman, and Mary Huff.\n\nStylistically, SCOTS gravitate towards the rockabilly, surf rock, country and R&B genres, with a punk edge and outrageous humor thrown in:Guitarist/singer Rick Miller, drummer Dave Hartman and bassist/singer/heartbreaker Mary Huff, play a greasy mix of surf, rockabilly, R&B and country-fried garage with a side of psych, all the while driving fans into ecstatic, sweat-drenched paroxysms of joy. It’s a musical gumbo Miller calls, “Americana from the wrong side of the tracks.“ The band has been prolific and ubiquitous for over thirty years, touring everywhere from the North Carolina prison system to Mount Fuji, Japan, and delivering what \"Rolling Stone\" calls “a hell raising rock and roll party.“\n\nSCOTS's music is generally very upbeat, as they usually write and perform songs about dancing, sex, and fried chicken, which are main themes in songs such as \"Cheap Motels,\" \"Soul City,\" and \"Eight Piece Box.\" They are also known for their live shows, which often include throwing fried chicken and banana pudding into the audience, and audience members invited to dance onstage. As a general rule, they are not hostile toward non-commercial taping of their shows.\n\nThe band appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" in 1995, performing \"Camel Walk\" from their album \"Dirt Track Date\", where Jay Leno jokingly said Drew Carey performed on drums. They also appeared numerous times on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". The song \"Soul City\" was heard in the 1996 film \"Happy Gilmore\", as well as the 2005 \"Dukes Of Hazzard\" movie. The song \"White Trash\" is featured in the soundtrack for the 1996 film \"Beavis and Butt-head Do America\". The song \"Camel Walk\" is used in the 1996 movie \"Flirting with Disaster\", the 1997 movie \"Perdita Durango\", and the 2009 movie \"Schwerkraft.\" It also was used on the first season of the TV show \"Psych\" in the episode \"Weekend Warriors.\" \"My Baby's Got the Strangest Ways\" appears on the soundtrack to the 1997 slasher film \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". The band can also be seen performing the song on a beach party in the movie.

Rick Miller appeared on episode 174 of the Americana Music Show and described their 2013 release, \"Dig This!\" as being inspired by having to dig ditches around his Kudzu Ranch recording studio to fix its septic tank. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic featured a style parody of Southern Culture on the Skids entitled \"Lame Claim to Fame\" on his 14th studio album, \"Mandatory Fun\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Southern Culture on the Skids among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1835594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835594", "title": "Aquagirl", "text": "Aquagirl\n\nAquagirl is the name of several fictional characters featured as superheroines in the comic books and other media produced by DC Comics.\n\nLisa Morel is introduced in \"Adventure Comics\" #266 (November 1959) as one of several violet-eyed Atlantean children born unable to adapt to the watery world. They had been sent to the surface in waterproof lifeboats so they might survive among land-dwellers, and Lisa had been adopted by the scientist Dr. Hugo Morel and his wife. With Aquaman in danger, Lisa's water-breathing and telepathic powers awaken; she makes herself a costume identical to Aquaman's, takes on the name \"Aquagirl\" and fights alongside him. However, her new-found powers are short-lived, and she loses them permanently. This is the first and last appearance of the character.\n\nSelena is a young Poseidonis teenager who temporarily teams up with Aquaman under the name \"Aqua-Girl\" in \"World's Finest Comics\" #133 (May 1963) to make her former boyfriend jealous. She succeeds, making Aqualad jealous of her temporary status as Aquaman's sidekick as well. This is the first and last appearance of the character.\n\nTula is introduced in \"Aquaman\" vol. 1 #33 (May–June 1967). After losing her parents soon after her birth, she had been found and adopted by one of the royal families of Atlantis. Given the title Princess of Poseidonis, Tula is schooled in Atlantean traditions, and never leaves the royal palace until she meets Aqualad (Garth) at age 15 in this issue.\n\nTula sometimes helps Aqualad with missions during his time with the original Teen Titans, using the name Aquagirl. When Aquaman leaves his throne to search for his then-missing wife Mera, Narkran takes over Atlantis as a dictator. His reign falls only when Tula leads a rebellion against him. Tula and Garth resume their romance when he returns to Atlantis and they later appear in the 1980s revival series \"New Teen Titans\" to aid the Titans in bringing down the H.I.V.E..\n\nDuring the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" limited series (1985–1986), Aquagirl is killed by the villain Chemo when she drowns in water that he has poisoned.\n\nYears later, in the \"Tempest\" miniseries, a woman claiming to be Tula enters Garth's life. In truth, it is a doppelgänger created by the villainous Slizzath as part of an elaborate plan to siphon Garth's mystical energies for his own dark purposes. Garth sees through the ruse, is able to defeat Slizzath and finally gain a sense of closure about Tula's death. It is also at this time that Garth adopted a new identity as \"Tempest\".\n\nMost recently, Tula reappears in \"Teen Titans\" (vol. 3) #30-31. Aquagirl is brought back to life by Brother Blood—along with Hawk and Dove, Phantasm, and Kole—to fight against the Titans. After being freed by Beast Boy and Raven, Kid Eternity is able to lay the deceased Titans back to rest.\n\nTula has a statue in the \"Hall of Fallen Titans\" at Titans Tower, alongside the original Hawk and Dove, Kole and others. A year later, Tula is channeled by Kid Eternity when the Titans face Blood again. She angrily beats the villain, claiming to be enraged about being resurrected as his puppet. She later is then returned to the afterlife after her time limit in Eternity's body is reached.\n\nIn the \"Blackest Night\" miniseries, Tula, Aquaman and Dolphin appear as a group of reanimated Black Lanterns who attack Tempest and Mera. Tula and Dolphin argue over Tempest, at the same time mocking him for not saving them. Sensing Garth's hope that she could fight what had been done to her, Tula tore out his heart, killing him and bringing about his reanimation as a Black Lantern. Tula later appears to battle the Titans. However, her body is soon destroyed by a burst of white light emanating from Dawn Granger.\n\nIn September 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Tula is first seen as a shadowing female Atlantean reporting to the current King of Atlantis, Orm, a.k.a. the Ocean Master, about the attacks made to the boy born with purple eyes, who is believed by some to bring the end of Atlantis. The Ocean Master ordered Garth to be returned to his mother unharmed. She later battles Cyborg during Atlantis' invasion of the United States, and later, when Aquaman becomes the king of Atlantis, she is seen reporting to him and according to the conversation she had with him, it is revealed that she and Orm share the same father, meaning that Orm is her half-brother.\n\nLorena Marquez is another fictional character to use the codename Aquagirl. She is a comic book superhero published by DC Comics. Lorena debuted in \"Aquaman\" vol. 6 #16 (May 2004), and was created by Will Pfeifer and Patrick Gleason.\n\nLorena Marquez is on a date at the San Diego Zoo when an earthquake shakes San Diego and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands—including Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health as she discovers that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean. The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, as well as Anton Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe. Lorena and Aquaman have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as \"Sub Diego.\" When Ocean Master switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl, adopting an aquatic costume. After Aquaman exposes Ocean Master's scheme, Lorena keeps her Aquagirl costume and identity, and the two carry on protecting Sub Diego. When a string of homicides begin to emerge in Sub Diego, Lorena was one of the first to discover that it was former police officer Chandra Abbot who was guilty. The two fight and Chandra admits she did not understand why Aquaman would allow Lorena to help him but she at that moment she understood, she is a good detective.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" Volume 3 #34 (May 2006), Lorena is shown at Titans Tower arguing with Holly Granger during a flashback. Lorena is also a member of the Teen Titans during the events of \"52\". She assists Steel in launching an attack on LexCorp when Natasha Irons is captured by Lex Luthor. She later resurfaces as supporting character of the new Aquaman, Arthur Joseph Curry, in \"Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis\". Apparently, as one of the last Sub Diegoans able to breathe water, she is left in the seas, mourning Koryak's death in the rubble of Poseidonis. She then joins Curry, Cal Durham, Tempest, and the new Topo in their voyage to Sub Diego. Aquagirl appears up in \"Terror Titans\" #1 and is kidnapped (along with a group of other teen superheroes) by the Terror Titans. While her teammate Molecule is slain by the new Persuader, Lorena is taken alive, to be mindwiped and forced to fight in the Dark Side Club at the behest of the Apokoliptan Gods on Earth. She is defeated twice, once by Rose Wilson after being stabbed, and again by a brainwashed Terra, who crushes Lorena with a pair of boulders. Aquagirl and the others are eventually freed by Miss Martian, and Lorena joins the survivors in a trek to Titans Tower in order to recover.\n\nWhile resting in the tower, Lorena meets and befriends Static, telling him that she enjoyed her past experience as a member of the Teen Titans. After realizing that she has nowhere to go and no family, Lorena accepts Wonder Girl's offer to rejoin the team, taking up permanent residence in Titans Tower.\n\nRemaining close friends with Static, Lorena also begins flirting in Spanish with her teammate Blue Beetle, despite him already dating teen superheroine and Titan reserve member, Traci 13. She also quickly gains an enemy in Bombshell, finding her to be rude. Despite her apparent concern for both Static and Blue Beetle, Aquagirl begins flirting with Superboy after she witnesses a fight between him and Wonder Girl.\n\nDuring a mission to rescue Raven from an extradimensional being called Wyld, Aquagirl and Bombshell are swallowed by massive sea monster mutated from Wyld's energy. After Static destroys Wyld, Aquagirl and Bombshell are left missing at sea with their fates uncertain. In the following issue, it is mentioned that both Bombshell and Aquagirl had been rescued by their teammates, but were sidelined from the Titans due to Wonder Girl no longer wishing to endanger \"inexperienced\" teen heroes by allowing them membership.\n\nIn the \"Brightest Day\" crossover, Lorena is approached by Mera who had come searching for help against her sister and her Death Squad. She and Mera subsequently reappear when Siren and her army attack Miami, Florida as the opening salvo of an invasion. During the battle, Lorena rescues the new Aqualad by kicking Black Manta in the face just as he is about to stab the youth to death. After Mera and Aqualad successfully trap the invaders inside the Bermuda Triangle, Lorena tells Aqualad not to \"get any ideas\" as the two teens watch Aquaman and Mera passionately kiss.\n\nShe is one of the former Titans that came to aid them in the battle between Superboy-Prime.\n\nIn the 1996 limited series \"Kingdom Come\", Aquagirl is Tula II, the estranged teenage daughter of Garth (formerly Aqualad, now Aquaman). She is named Tula after her father's late girlfriend and is part of a team consisting of the other original Titans' children who end up taking Batman's side in the story's key conflict. In her appearances, Tula seemingly demonstrates a partial shapeshifting ability, changing parts of her body to resemble those of sea creatures. She is last seen battling Donna Troy during the climatic battle at the superhuman Gulag and is possibly killed by the nuclear explosion that ends the conflict.\n\nThis Tula's mother is possibly Deep Blue, described in annotations for the series as \"Mizuko Perkins\", daughter of Tsunami and Neptune Perkins. In standard DC Comics continuity, Deep Blue is Aquaman's half-sister Debbie, the daughter of Tsunami and Atlan, raised by Tsunami and Neptune Perkins.\n\nIn the \"Titans Tomorrow\" timeline, Lorena is Aquawoman, a member of the Titans. It is revealed that she has developed telepathic powers which she had used to kill (or paralyze) former Titan member Garth.\n\nIn \"Batman Beyond\", Aquagirl is Mareena, a member of the future Justice League and the daughter of Aquaman. The character was created specifically for the \"Batman Beyond\" episodes \"The Call: Part 1\" (November 11, 2000) and \"The Call: Part 2\" (November 18, 2000), in which Batman meets the \"Justice League Unlimited\", a future version of the Justice League. Aquagirl was voiced by Jodi Benson. When Batman is going over her file on the computer, it is shown that she is the daughter of Aquaman, with powers including control over water. She later reappears in the \"Justice League Unlimited\" series (which showcases the present-day lineup of the \"JLU\") in \"Epilogue\". She has very distinctive platinum blonde hair; it is always wet and slicked evenly back. Her costume varies; she is usually portrayed wearing a one-piece swimsuit of various colors with bare arms and legs and fingerless gloves.\n\nTula (though she is never referred to as Aquagirl in season one) first appears in \"Young Justice\" in the episode \"Downtime\", voiced by Cree Summer. She is portrayed as the childhood friend of Kaldur'ahm who ultimately entered into a relationship with his friend Garth after Kaldur left Atlantis to become Aquaman's sidekick. Unlike the comics, the Tula in \"Young Justice\" possesses mystical abilities that can help her create, control and manipulate water into any shape she wishes, abilities that many Atlanteans, including Kaldur, have. When Kaldur returns to Poseidonis for a dinner with the royal family, he invites Tula as his guest, unaware that she has already left him for his best friend. She eventually tells him about this, and the two reconcile during an attack on the city led by Black Manta, with Kaldur departing on friendly terms when he eventually returns to the surface world. Tula and Garth make a cameo appearance in the episode \"Failsafe\", working alongside Red Arrow, Rocket and Zatanna in a training simulation. In the episode \"Alienated\" (set five years later, in Season Two: Invasion), it is mentioned that Tula's death (during the events of the video game \"Young Justice: Legacy\") is one of the reasons Aqualad has apparently turned on his former team (while actually going undercover to investigate the Light's partner). This is the first instance of Tula being referenced as Aquagirl in the series. In the episode \"Satisfaction\", her statue is among the other yellow statues of fallen heroes located in the grotto of Mount Justice. In the episode \"The Fix\", Tula appears as a psychic projection when Miss Martian and Artemis Crock psionically enter Aqualad's subconscious mind.\n\nIn season two of \"Entourage\", Mandy Moore portrays Aquagirl in the Aquaman movie that exists in the \"Entourage\" fictional universe. The storyline has Moore, playing herself as the ex-girlfriend of character Vince, about to be dropped from the project due to the turmoil of their personal relationship. Mandy is not removed from the movie however, and Vince and Mandy re-kindle their former romance. Following this, Mandy breaks Vince's heart again, stating that she still loves her former fiancé, Chris. Vince decides to continue working on the movie with Mandy still attached. It then becomes the highest-grossing movie opening of all time.\n\nTula makes a cameo appearance in \"\" as a member of Aquaman's army in the altered timeline. She is killed in the final battle with the Amazons.\n\nTula, as Aquagirl, appears in \"\", with Cree Summer reprising the role. She serves as the coordinator of the Team, providing information on The Light's attempts to steal the pieces of an ancient statue, and keeping the pieces safe. Near the end of the game, Klarion disguised as Tempest tricks her into giving him the pieces of the statue, and kidnaps her, intending to use her magic to revive Tiamat in Bialya. The Team arrives to free Tula and defeat Klarion and Blockbuster, but is too late to stop Tiamat's revival. When Tiamat proves too powerful to kill, a weakened Tula offers to use her remaining magic to defeat and imprison Tiamat again, sacrificing herself just like Marduk did in ancient times. Tula succeeds, but is killed by falling debris. Tempest grieves her death, and Aqualad quits the Team, leading up to the events in the second season of the show.\n"}

It is among the smallest of county seats nationwide, with a population as of the 2010 census of 97. Murphy is part of the Boise City–Nampa, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. Murphy is also located within the census-designated place bearing its name. Murphy is home to the Owyhee County Historical Museum and Library.\n\nMurphy developed around a railhead of the Boise, Nampa and Owyhee Railroad, built in 1899 by Colonel William H. Dewey. Dewey had planned to extend the railroad to Silver City, but when mining operations in the Owyhee Mountains became unproductive, the line was not continued past Murphy. The railroad operated until 1947.\n\nBy a narrow margin, Owyhee County voters selected Murphy as county seat in 1934, succeeding Silver City (which was located in the Owyhee Mountains and had been in decline; it is now defunct). Although the county seat was moved to Murphy after the vote, and a new Owyhee County Courthouse was constructed in 1936, the Idaho State Legislature did not ratify the change of county seat until 1999. The error in the Idaho Code, discovered by county prosecutor G. Edward Yarbrough, was finally corrected by Senate Bill 1009.\n\nThe community likely was named after Cornelius \"Con\" Murphy, a crew boss with the Boise, Nampa and Owyhee Railroad and foreman during construction of the Guffey Bridge in 1897.

It was the first television show to feature the Smothers Brothers as regulars, following a series of night club and guest appearances. It lasted one season, consisting of 32 episodes.\n\nIt was also the network's last situation comedy filmed in black-and-white; shortly after its final telecast, all CBS prime-time series were transmitted in color. In 1986, two decades after cancellation, reruns were seen on Nick at Nite.\n\nDick Smothers played himself as a rising young executive at Pandora Publications, working for publisher Leonard J. Costello (Roland Winters). Brother Tom had been lost at sea two years earlier and now shows up as an apprentice angel assigned to do good deeds on Earth to earn his wings and become a full-fledged angel. Of course, Tom's efforts to help people never seem to work as planned and Dick had to help him clean up the mess. Tom received his orders from Ralph, his unseen and unheard boss. The series also featured Harriet MacGibbon as Mrs. Costello, and on occasion, Ann Elder as Dick's co-worker and girl friend Janet (Eileen O'Neill) also appeared in several episodes as another of Dick's girl friends, Wanda. As was typical of the Smothers Brothers in \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", Dick was typically the straight man to Tom's humorous antics.\n\nThe series was produced by Four Star Television in association with the brothers' Knave Productions (named for Tom's catchphrase \"Curb Your Tongue, Knave!\", and the title of their 1963 record album).\n\nThis series may have inspired the Brothers' more successful later series \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" in that Tom Smothers had been critical of the series as not being compatible with the brothers' strengths (in fact, he fought with Four Star executives over more creative control of the series, earning an ulcer and irritating his marital relationship to the point of divorce at the end of the season).\n\nFor instance, neither brother played their instruments on the show (with one exception, at the beginning of \"'Twas The Week Before Christmas\" episode), and it was not until halfway through the season that they sang the theme song.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835606", "title": "Pseudopregnancy", "text": "Pseudopregnancy\n\nIn mammalian species, pseudopregnancy is a physical state whereby all the signs and symptoms of pregnancy are exhibited, with the exception of the presence of a foetus, creating a false pregnancy. The corpus luteum (the remains of an ovulated ovarian follicle) is responsible for the development of maternal behavior and lactation, which are mediated by the continued production of progesterone by the corpus luteum through some or all of pregnancy. In most species, the corpus luteum is degraded in the absence of a pregnancy. However, in some species, the corpus luteum may persist in the absence of pregnancy and cause \"pseudopregnancy\", in which the female will exhibit clinical signs of pregnancy.\n\nPseudopregnancy occurs when a female cat ovulates but is not fertilised due to breeding with an infertile male, spontaneous ovulation or due to the owner stimulating ovulation. The corpus luteum is present after ovulation and persists for around 37 days. The length of pseudopregnancy varies greatly with the mean duration being 41 days. After pseudopregnancy, the female cat returns to proestrus and can become pregnant again. The pseudopregnancy lasts around half the length of a normal pregnancy in cats. This is advantageous to cats as they can conceive earlier making them more efficient in reproduction.\n\nCats become pseudopregnant following an estrus in which the queen is bred by an infertile male. Queens are induced ovulators, meaning that they will only ovulate and produce a corpus luteum if they are bred. The corpus luteum persists as if the queen were pregnant because the queen's body cannot distinguish between the pregnant and non-pregnant state (aside from the initial mechanical trigger of coitus). Pseudopregnant queens rarely show any mammary enlargement or behavioral signs and therefore rarely require treatment. Pseudopregnancy in cats is uncommon as the queen must be bred by an \"infertile\" male to become pseudopregnant, compounded by the fact that cats are seasonal breeders.\n\nThe progesterone and estradiol profiles in pseudopregnancy are very different when compared to normal pregnancy. During pseudopregnancy, estradiol increases straight after mating and then decreases to normal levels. The amount of progesterone does not increase until 2–3 days post copulation, then the level rises until day 21 post copulation where after it gradually declines to normal levels.\n\nPseudopregnancy is a normal physiologic process that occurs in female dogs. It is seen 45–60 days after a normal estrous (heat) period. After ovulation, progesterone levels rise. Pseudopregnancy happens when the progesterone levels begin to fall as decreasing progesterone leads to an increase of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is responsible for the behaviours seen during pseudopregnancy. Dogs may exhibit mothering of toys, nesting or aggression. Mammary development and milk production are common. Pseudopregnancy can also be acutely induced by spaying (removing of ovaries) a dog near the end of estrus. Spaying removes the source of progesterone and induces a rise in prolactin.\n\nPermanent prevention of pseudopregnancy is accomplished with spaying.\n\nDogs become pseudopregnant following an estrus phase in which the female dog is not bred, or in which she is bred by an infertile male. Most species require signals from an embryo (such as IFN-τ in ruminants) to alert the female's body of a pregnancy. This maternal recognition of pregnancy will cause persistence of the corpus luteum and the development of characteristics and behaviors necessary to care for offspring. Limited research suggests that progesterone secretion is similar in pregnant and non-pregnant female dogs, so veterinary researchers hypothesize that they may not require molecular factors from the embryo for maternal recognition of pregnancy, and instead the corpus luteum persists regardless of pregnancy. Since the corpus luteum is not degraded, it will cause the development of maternal characteristics in the absence of pregnancy. Pseudopregnant dogs will develop their mammary glands, lactate, and build nests to varying degrees depending on breed. Although female dogs usually only cycle once or twice per year, pseudopregnancy is common.\n\nPseudopregnancy or \"not-in-pig\" is a condition that occurs when females exhibit physiological and behavioral signs associated with pregnancy, but there are no fetuses present. Pseudopregnancy can occur when all of the embryos are resorbed after the maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 10–15 postmating) and before fetal calcification (days 35–40 of gestation). The sow remains in anoestrus for prolonged periods, often as long as 115 days. These animals may exhibit varying degrees of udder development, but fail to deliver any pigs. The timely identification and removal of non-pregnant females from the breeding herd is important because it reduces both non-productive sow days and production costs.\n\nTechniques used for pregnancy diagnosis in swine include ultrasonography, amplitude depth machines, and Doppler machines.\n\nMycotoxins have been shown to be detrimental to sows and gilts by causing the female to retain a \"corpora lutea\" inhibiting cyclicity and causing a pseudopregnancy; as well as a constant exhibition of estrus, and infertility. Pregnant females produce litters that result in a higher number of stillborns, mummified fetuses, and abortions. Before breeding, ingesting mycotoxins mimics the action of estradiol-17β. Specifically, zearalenone binds to estrogenic receptors that would normally bind to estrogen, causing the female to exhibit constant estrus.\n\nThe initiation of pseudopregnancy is basically similar to the pregnancy regarding the activation of progestational state. The neuroendocrine pathway of pseudopregnancy in rats is mainly initiated by the nocturnal surge of prolactin. The hormone prolactin produced regulates the activation and early maintenance of corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is known as a site of progesterone production in order for the uterus undergoes a decidual process. There are two types of induced pseudopregnancy; coitally induced pseudopregnancy and non-coitally induced pseudopregnancy.\n\nThe coitally induced pseudopregnancy is stimulated by the action of copulation. The copulation stimulation causes the nocturnal prolactin elevation which then activates the corpus luteum. The multiple intromission coital pattern initiates the neuroendocrine reflex which results in the sufficient progesterone secretion in pseudopregnancy. However, induction of pseudopregnancy requires adrenergic system to be activated and simultaneously inhibits the cholinergic system.\n\nThe non-coitally induced pseudopregnancy requires the presence of the initial stimulus until the levels of progesterone are sufficiently elevated to produce positive feedback on secretion of prolactin. The initial stimulus can be in a form of some socio-environmental factors, such as concaveation with foster pups in virgin rats or cohabitation in all-female groups in mice.\n\nMice become pseudopregnant following an estrus in which the female is bred by an infertile male, resulting in sterile mating. Like dogs, mice are spontaneous ovulators. However, they will not become pseudopregnant following an estrus in which the female does not mate because the corpus luteum will degrade rapidly in the absence of coitus. When the female is mated by an infertile male, the corpus luteum persists without an embryo, leading to pseudopregnancy. The female will develop mammary glands, lactate, and build nests in the pseudopregnant state. Pseudopregnancy in mice is somewhat common in laboratory mice because it is often induced for the purpose of implanting embryos into a surrogate dam, but is uncommon in wild mice because most wild males are fertile and will genuinely impregnate the female.\n"}
{"id": "1835610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835610", "title": "Cyperus esculentus", "text": "Cyperus esculentus\n\nCyperus esculentus (also called chufa, tigernut, atadwe, yellow nutsedge, and earth almond) is a crop of the sedge family widespread across much of the world. It is found in most of the Eastern Hemisphere, including Southern Europe, Africa and Madagascar, as well as the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. \"C. esculentus\" is cultivated for its edible tubers, called earth almonds or tiger nuts, as a snack food and for the preparation of \"horchata de chufa\", a sweet, milk-like beverage.\n\n\"Cyperus esculentus\" can be found wild, as a weed, or as a crop. It is an invasive species outside its native range, and is readily transported accidentally to become invasive. In many countries, \"C. esculentus\" is considered a weed. It is often found in wet soils such as rice paddies and peanut farms as well as well-irrigated lawns and golf courses during warm weather.\n\nIt has been suggested that the extinct hominin \"Paranthropus boisei\", the \"Nutcracker Man\", subsisted on tiger nuts.\n\nZohary and Hopf estimate that \"C. esculentus\" \"ranks among the oldest cultivated plants in Ancient Egypt\", although noting that \"chufa was no doubt an important food element in ancient Egypt during dynastic times, its cultivation in ancient times seems to have remained (totally or almost totally) an Egyptian specialty\". Its dry tubers have been found in tombs from predynastic times about 6000 years ago. In those times, \"C. esculentus\" tubers were consumed either boiled in beer, roasted, or as sweets made of ground tubers with honey. The tubers were also used medicinally, taken orally, as an ointment, or as an enema, and used in fumigants to sweeten the smell of homes or clothing. The plant was introduced to Spain by the Arabs, first in the Valencia region.\n\n\"Cyperus esculentus\" is an annual or perennial plant, growing to tall, with solitary stems growing from a tuber. The plant is reproduced by seeds, creeping rhizomes, and tubers. Due to its clonal nature, \"C. esculentus\" can take advantage of soil disturbances caused by anthropogenic or natural forces. The stems are triangular in section and bear slender leaves 3–10 mm (1/8 to 1/2 inches) wide. The spikelets of the plant are distinctive, with a cluster of flat, oval seeds surrounded by four hanging, leaf-like bracts positioned 90 degrees from each other. They are 5 to 30 mm (about 3/8 to 1 1/8 inches) long and linear to narrowly elliptic with pointed tips and 8 to 35 florets. The color varies from straw-colored to gold-brown. They can produce up to 2420 seeds per plant. The plant foliage is very tough and fibrous and is often mistaken for a grass. The roots are an extensive and complex system of fine, fibrous roots and scaly rhizomes with small, hard, spherical tubers and basal bulbs attached. \n\nThe tubers are 0.3 – 1.9 cm (1/8 to 3/4 inches) in diameter and the colors vary between yellow, brown, and black. One plant can produce several hundred to several thousand tubers during a single growing season. With cool temperatures, the foliage, roots, rhizomes, and basal bulbs die, but the tubers survive and resprout the following spring when soil temperatures remain above . They can resprout up to several years later. When the tubers germinate, many rhizomes are initiated and end in a basal bulb near the soil surface. These basal bulbs initiate the stems and leaves above ground, and fibrous roots underground. \"C. esculentus\" is wind pollinated and requires cross pollination as it is self–incompatible.\n\n\"C. esculentus\" is a highly invasive species in Oceania, Mexico, some regions of the United States, and the Caribbean, mainly by seed dispersion. It is readily transported internationally, and is adaptable to re-establish in varied climate and soil environments. In Japan, it is an exotic clonal weed favorable to establish in wet habitats.\n\n\"Cyperus esculentus\" cultivation requires a mild climate. Low temperature, shade, and light intensity can inhibit flowering. Tuber initiation is inhibited by high levels of nitrogen, long photoperiods, and high levels of gibberellic acid. Flower initiation occurs under photoperiods of 12 to 14 hours per day.\n\nTubers can develop in soil depths around 30 cm (1-foot), but most occur in the top or upper part. They tolerate many adverse soil conditions including periods of drought and flooding and survive soil temperatures around . They grow best on sandy, moist soils at a pH between 5.0 – 7.5. The densest populations of \"C. esculentus\" are often found in low-lying wetlands. They do not tolerate salinity.\n\n\"C. esculentus\" is cultivated in the United States, Guatemala, Mexico, Chile, Brasil, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, India, Yemen, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Sudan, South Sudan, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, Cameroon, and Mali, where they are used primarily as animal feed or as a side dish, but in Hispanic countries they are used mainly to make horchata, a sweet, milk-like beverage.\n\nPlanting is normally done on flat soils where ridges to favour the coming irrigations have previously been done. The separation between ridges is approximately and seeds are planted manually. Distances between seeds may vary from and seeding depth is around . A typical seeding rate for chufa is about 120 kg of tubers/ha (107 lbs/acre).\n\nThey are planted between April and May and must be irrigated every week until they are harvested in November and December. Tubers develop about 6 – 8 weeks after seedling emergence and grow quickly during July and August. The maturing is around 90 – 110 days. The average yield can approach between 10 and 19 t/ha.\n\nHarvest usually occurs in November or December and the leaves are scorched during the harvest. With a combine harvester, the tiger nut is pulled out of the ground. Immediately after harvesting, the tiger nuts are washed with water in order to remove sand and small stones. The drying occurs usually in the sun and can take up to three months. The temperatures and humidity levels have to be monitored very carefully during this period. The tiger nuts have to be turned every day to ensure uniform drying. The drying process ensures a longer shelf life. This prevents rot or other bacterial infections, securing quality and high nutrition levels.\nDisadvantages in the drying process are shrinkage, skin wrinkles and hard nut texture.\n\nTiger nut loses a considerable amount of water during drying and storage. The starch content of the tiger nut tubers decreases and the reducing sugar (invert sugar) content increases during storage. Tiger nut can be stored dry and rehydrated by soaking without losing the crisp texture. Soaking is often done overnight. Dried tiger nuts have a hard texture and soaking is indispensable to render them edible with ease and to ensure acceptable sensory quality.\n\nAccording to the \"Consejo Regulador de Chufa de Valencia\" (Regulating Council for Valencia's Tiger Nuts), the nutritional composition/100 ml of the Spanish beverage horchata de chufas is as follows: energy content around 66 kcal, proteins around 0.5 g, carbohydrates over 10 g with starch at least 1.9 g, fats at least 2 g.\n\nDried tiger nut has a smooth, tender, sweet, and nutty taste. It can be consumed raw, roasted, dried, baked or as tiger nut milk or oil.\n\nIn Spain, the drink now known as horchata de chufa (also sometimes called horchata de chufas or, in West African countries such as Nigeria and Mali, kunnu aya) is the original form of horchata. It is made from soaked, ground and sweetened tiger nuts. According to researchers at the University of Ilorin, kunnu made from tiger nuts is an inexpensive source of protein.[citation needed]\nIt remains popular in Spain, where a regulating council exists to ensure the quality and traceability of the product in relation to the designation of origin. There it is served ice-cold as a natural refreshment in the summer, often served with fartons. Horchata de chufa is also used instead of dairy milk by the lactose-intolerant.[citation needed]\nThe majority of the Spanish tiger nut crop is utilised in the production of horchata de chufa. Alboraya is the most important production centre.\n\nThe tubers are edible, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavour, compared to the more bitter-tasting tuber of the related \"Cyperus rotundus\" (purple nutsedge). They are quite hard and are generally soaked in water before they can be eaten, making them much softer and giving them a better texture. They are a popular snack in West Africa.\n\nThey have various uses, such as horchata, a nonalcoholic beverage of milky appearance derived from the tubers of the tiger nut plant mixed with sugar and water, and commonly consumed in Spain.\n\nIn Northern Nigeria, it is called \"aya\" and it is usually eaten fresh. It is sometimes dried and later rehydrated and eaten. Also a snack is made by toasting the nuts and sugar coating it is popular among the Hausa children of Northern Nigeria. Also, a drink known as \"kunun aya\" is made by processing the nuts with dates and later sieved and served chilled.\n\nFlour of roasted tiger nut is sometimes added to biscuits and other bakery products as well as in making oil, soap, and starch extracts. It is also used for the production of nougat, jam, beer, and as a flavoring agent in ice cream and in the preparation of kunnu (a local beverage in Nigeria). Kunnu is a nonalcoholic beverage prepared mainly from cereals (such as millet or sorghum) by heating and mixing with spices (dandelion, alligator pepper, ginger, licorice) and sugar. To make up for the poor nutritional value of kunnu prepared from cereals, tiger nut was found to be a good substitute for cereal grains. Tiger nut oil can be used naturally with salads or for deep frying. It is considered to be a high quality oil. Tiger nut “milk” has been tried as an alternative source of milk in fermented products, such as yogurt production, and other fermented products common in some African countries and can thus be useful replacing milk in the diet of people intolerant to lactose to a certain extent.\n\nDespite its name, tiger nutsedge is a tuber. However, its chemical composition shares characteristics with tubers and with nuts. This tuber is rich in energy content (starch, fat, sugar, and protein), and dietary minerals (mainly phosphorus and potassium). The oil of the tuber was found to contain 18% saturated (palmitic acid and stearic acid) and 82% unsaturated (oleic acid and linoleic acid) fatty acids.\n\nSince the tubers of \"C. esculentus\" contain 20-36% oil, it has been suggested as potential oil crop for the production of biodiesel. One study found that chufa produced 1.5 metric tonnes of oil per hectare (174 gallons/acre) based on a tuber yield of 5.67 t/ha and an oil content of 26.4%. A similar 6-year study found tuber yields ranging from 4.02 to 6.75 t/ha, with an average oil content of 26.5% and an average oil yield of 1.47 t/ha.\n\nThe boiled nuts are used in the UK as a bait for carp. The nuts have to be prepared in a prescribed manner to prevent harm to the fish. The nuts are soaked in water for 24 hours, and then boiled for 20 minutes or longer until fully expanded. Some anglers then leave the boiled nuts to ferment for 24–48 hours, which can enhance their effectiveness. If the nuts are not properly prepared, they can be toxic to carp. This was originally thought to have been the cause of death of Benson, a large, well-known female carp weighing found floating dead in a fishing lake, with a bag of unprepared tiger nuts lying nearby, empty, on the bank. An examination of the fish by a taxidermist concluded tiger nut poisoning was not the cause of death, but rather the fish had died naturally.\n\n\"C. esculentus\" is extremely difficult to remove completely once established. This is due to the plant having a stratified and layered root system, with tubers and roots being interconnected to a depth of 36 cm or more. The tubers are connected by fragile roots that are prone to snapping when pulled, making the root system difficult to remove intact. Intermediate rhizomes can potentially reach a length of 60 cm. The plant can quickly regenerate if a single tuber is left in place. By competing for light, water and nutrients it can reduce the vigour of neighbouring plants. It can develop into a dense colony. Patch boundaries can increase by more than one meter per year. Tubers and seed disperse with agricultural activities, soil movement or by water and wind. They are often known as a contaminant in crop seeds. When plants are small they are hard to distinguish from other weeds such as \"Dactylis glomerata\" and \"Elytrigia repens\". Thus it is hard to discover in an early stage and therefore hard to counteract. Once it is detected, mechanical removal, hand removal, grazing, damping, and herbicides can be used to inhibit \"C. esculentus\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1835614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835614", "title": "Campbell's dwarf hamster", "text": "Campbell's dwarf hamster\n\nCampbell's dwarf hamster (\"Phodopus campbelli\") is a species of hamster in the genus \"Phodopus\". It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas in honor of Charles William Campbell, who collected the first specimen in Mongolia on July 1, 1902. It is distinguished from the closely related Djungarian hamster as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on its crown. Campbell's dwarf hamster typically has a narrow dorsal stripe compared to the Djungarian hamster and grey fur on the stomach. This hamster may be raised in captivity and kept as a small pet.\n\nIn the wild, the breeding season for Campbell's dwarf hamster varies by location. For example, the breeding season begins towards the middle of April in Tuva and towards the end of April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed breeding season and they can breed frequently throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of \"Phodopus\" and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.\n\nThis hamster is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is native to China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russian Federation.\n\nThe binomial name of Campbell's dwarf hamster is \"Phodopus campbelli\". This species is the type species of \"Cricetiscus\" (named by Thomas in 1917, and now considered a synonym of \"Phodopus\"), and is named after C. W. Campbell, who first collected it on July 1, 1902, in Inner Mongolia. Type locality was the village Shaborte in Mongolia. This locality has puzzled later writers and was believed to be a general Mongolian word for a dry lake, and therefore with no specific coordinates. However, in the reprint of C. W. Campbell's book \"Travels in Mongolia\" it is clear that Shaborte is an actual village on the route followed through Mongolia. Thomas described the type specimen in 1905 as \"Cricetulus campbelli\".\n\nSynonyms for this species are \"Phodopus crepidatus\" and \"Phodopus tuvinicus\". Common names have been applied to Campbell's dwarf hamster, including the striped hairy-footed hamster, the Djungarian hamster, the Siberian hamster, and Campbell's hamster. Campbell's dwarf hamster is commonly confused with the Djungarian hamster (\"Phodopus sungorus\") due to some of the common names, such as the \"Siberian hamster\" also being used to describe the Djungarian hamster.\n\nAmerican biologist Ned Hollister described a subspecies in 1912:\n\n\nThe size of Campbell's dwarf hamster varies depending on its location. For example, eight wild specimens examined from Mongolia showed an average head and body length of , an average hind foot length of long, with a tail length of . In captivity, they are proportionally larger, as commercial pet food and fruits provide more nutrition than food found commonly in the wild. The lips and cheeks have white fur and the rest of the fur around the face can be either grey or brown. A dark and narrow dorsal stripe runs along the center of the back from the nape of the neck to about above the tail. The surface of the hands and feet are white to ensure the animal stays warm in colder climates in countries such as Mongolia.\nIn both the wild and captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters scent-mark around their territories using Harderian glands, skin glands located behind the ears. They use urine and feces for communication.\n\nCampbell's dwarf hamster is distinguished from the similar-looking Djungarian hamster by its smaller ears and no dark patch on the crown of its head, in certain colorations. The dorsal stripe of Campbell's dwarf hamster is narrower, shorter, and darker than that of the Djungarian hamster, and the fur on the stomach of Campbell's dwarf hamster is grey, but it is white on the Djungarian hamster. Campbell's dwarf hamster does not turn white in the winter and has a grey tint to its fur. It has a smaller interorbital breadth, but has a larger auditory bulla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is much less tolerant to lower temperatures than the Djungarian hamster. A laboratory experiment showed Campbell's dwarf hamster can resist temperatures as low as , where the Djungarian hamster can withstand temperatures as low as . Campbell's dwarf hamster reacts to lower temperatures by constantly exercising and tries to find a sheltered location, unlike the Djungarian hamster, which curls up and relies on its autonomic thermoregulation.\n\nCampbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, which are an extension of the mouth, extending from the mouth all the way to the rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.\n\nCampbell's dwarf hamster is prone to genetic abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.\n\nHamsters kept in captivity live for around 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.\n\nAs omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat a variety of different foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.\n\nIn addition to a commercially prepared seed mix, a balanced diet for a Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry leaves, are also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity.\n\nA hamster in captivity can occasionally eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled egg whites and small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must, therefore, gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into the skin of the mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.\n\nCertain food items commonly consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters and should be avoided completely in captivity. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.\n\nIn the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary across the population range. A total of 51 different species of plants were identified to be consumed by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being \"Stipa capillata\" and species of \"Allium\". However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by the population, the most common being \"Potentilla\". Campbell's dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs.\n\nIn Tuva, the breeding season of Campbell's dwarf hamster begins in April, and in Mongolia, it begins in at the end of April or the beginning of May. However, in all distribution ranges, it ends in late September or early October. \nIn captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters breed throughout the year, with no fixed breeding season, but a large number are born in the summer months. In the wild, three to four litters are produced each year, with an average of eight offspring per litter. In captivity, females can have between one and 18 litters per year, with one to nine offspring per litter.\nIn captivity, the gestation period for Campbell's dwarf hamster is between 18 and 20 days, and the shortest gestation period recorded for a captive female was 13 days. The male hamster is likely to assist the female during birth. The male may pull the offspring from the birth canal, clean them, or collect food for the mother and offspring.\n\nWhen the offspring are born, they are hairless and have a body mass of approximately . Incisors and claws are already formed, but the digits, eyes, and pinnae are closed and cannot be used. The rate at which the young develop differs depending on the distribution range. However, the differences are usually no longer than a day. In Tuva, the pinnae open on the first day of birth and are completely open after three days of development. However, in Mongolia, the same process occurs between two and four days of development. Fur first grows on the crown, back, and abdomen. The young usually have a full coat of fur after seven days of development. Offspring born in captivity have a shorter development time than those born in the wild. Specifically, the growth and development of the head and body, tail, hind feet, and pinnae can be up to a day sooner than those found in the wild. After 28 days of development in captivity, the young are already around half the mass of their parents.\n\nIn captivity, females become sexually mature at two months of age. The ovarian follicle forms about 16 days prior to the birth of the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.\n\nIn captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters are able to interbreed and produce live offspring or hybrids. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic information can be very similar, genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems.\n\nThe two species of \"Phodopus\" hamsters (\"P. sungorus\" and \"P. campbelli\") have the same number of chromosomes, and the chromosomes are similar in terms of size and morphology. However, several chromosomes show structural differences in the location and size of C-heterochromatin blocks. In nature, the two species do not meet, but will mate and produce offspring in captivity. However, both reciprocal crosses produce sterile hybrid males and females with decreased fertility. There is a clear effect in which types the parents are. The cross \"P. sungorus\" male x \"P. campbelli\" female will have embryos that grow normally, like both parent species. But the cross between \"P. campbelli\" male x \"P. sungorus\" female result in overgrowth, leading to embryonic death.\n\nCampbell's dwarf hamsters inhabit burrows in the steppes and semideserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva, and the Hebei province in northeastern China. A burrow can contain four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels. The tunnels leading to the nesting area can be as deep as below the ground, but are usually deep. The burrows are lined with either dry grass or sheep's wool. They may sometimes share burrows with Daurian pikas, but only in the steppes and semideserts of northern Manchuria. In parts of Mongolia, the hamsters may also share burrows with species of \"Meriones\" to save them from digging their own. In Tuva, Campbell's dwarf hamsters have been found living with other hamsters, such as the Chinese striped hamster, the Roborovski hamster, and the long-tailed dwarf hamster. The diets of the three types of hamsters are different to avoid fighting over the same type of food, which is why they live together.\n\nCampbell's dwarf hamsters may also live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, they may be found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have thermoregulation like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.\n\nThis hamster is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population and distribution size is large, and no major or widespread threats to the species are known. However, due to the increasing number of livestock in the areas of distribution, such as the steppes of central Asia, some burrows are at a small risk of being destroyed. In arid areas of distribution, the reduction in the number of water sources is also a minor concern. These hamsters are conserved in protected areas.\n\n"}

A remake of \"My Favorite Wife\" (1940), a screwball comedy starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, it was Monroe's last work, but from the beginning its production was disrupted by her personal troubles, and after her death on August 5, 1962, the film was abandoned. Most of its completed footage remained unseen for many years.\n\n20th Century Fox overhauled the entire production idea the following year with mostly new cast and crew and produced their \"My Favorite Wife\" remake, now entitled \"Move Over, Darling\" (1963) and starring Doris Day, James Garner, and Polly Bergen.\n\nDespite the similar title, this film has no connection with \"Something's Gotta Give,\" a 2003 film starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.\n\nEllen Arden (Monroe), a photographer and mother of two small children, has been declared legally dead, having been lost at sea in the Pacific. Her husband Nick (Dean Martin) has remarried; he and his new wife, Bianca (Cyd Charisse), are on their honeymoon when Ellen, rescued from an island where she has been stranded for five years, returns home. The family dog remembers her, but the children do not. However, they take a liking to her, and invite her to stay. Ellen assumes a foreign accent and pretends to be a woman named Ingrid Tic. Nick, flustered by the revelation that he's now married to two women, makes great effort to keep the truth from his new wife all the while trying to quash her amorous advances. Upon learning that Ellen was marooned on the island with a man, Stephen Burkett (Tom Tryon) — whom she knew as \"Adam\" to her \"Eve\" — he becomes jealous and suspicious of her fidelity. To calm his fears, Ellen enlists a meek shoe salesman (Wally Cox) to impersonate her island companion.\n\nThe film's script was written by Arnold Schulman, Nunnally Johnson and Walter Bernstein, and was an update of the 1940 film's story by Leo McCarey and Samuel and Bella Spewack, which itself was a comedic update of \"Enoch Arden\", a tragic 1864 poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. This was to be the sixth film version based on the Tennyson poem.\n\nSeveral weeks before principal photography began, the cast and crew gathered for wardrobe tests on a set that was a fully lit recreation of George Cukor's Beverly Hills home. Production designer Gene Allen had sent a crew of men to Cukor's home at 9166 Cordell Drive to photograph the house and pool areas of the estate. According to Allen, Cukor was photographed in the set's courtyard with the intent of using the photo as his 1962 Christmas card.\n\nMarilyn Monroe had been absent from the screen for over a year. She had recently undergone gallbladder surgery, and had lost more than , reaching the lowest weight of her adult life. In six hours of testing, Monroe wore some of her own clothes and some of those commissioned by Fox for the film. Her costumes included a long blonde wig meant for the beginning of the film, a two-piece black wool suit (also worn in \"Let's Make Love\"), a black and white spaghetti strap silk dress, and a lime green two-piece bathing suit with a bottom designed to cover her navel.\n\nBefore shooting had begun, Monroe had let producer Henry Weinstein know that she had been asked by the White House to perform for President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in honor of his birthday on May 29, 1962. The producer granted her permission to attend the gala, believing there would be no problems on the set.\n\nOn the first day of production, April 23, 1962, Monroe telephoned Weinstein to tell him that she had a severe sinus infection and would not be on the set that morning. Apparently she had caught the infection after a trip to New York City during which she had visited her acting coach, Lee Strasberg of The Actors Studio, to go over her role. The studio sent staff Dr. Lee Siegel to examine the star at her home. His diagnosis would have postponed the movie for a month, but George Cukor refused to wait. Instead he reorganized the shooting schedule to film scenes around his leading lady. At 7:30 am, Cyd Charisse was telephoned and summoned to the Fox lot. Later that morning the first scene filmed involved Martin's character and Charisse, in an encounter with children building a tree house.\n\nOver the next month filming continued mostly without Monroe, who showed up only occasionally due to fever, headaches, chronic sinusitis and bronchitis. The production fell 10 days behind schedule. As Kennedy's birthday approached, no one on the production thought Monroe would keep her commitment to the White House although she had gotten clearance on April 9 to appear at the event. (\"Also see article\" \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\") Studio documents released after Monroe's death confirm her appearance at the political fundraising event that had been approved by Fox executives.\n\nBy this time, the production was over budget, and the script was still not completely finalized, despite writer Walter Bernstein's efforts. The script was rewritten nightly, with Monroe growing increasingly frustrated at having to memorize new scenes every day. When not before the camera, she spent much of her time on the set in her dressing room with Paula Strasberg, Lee's wife.\n\nUpon her return from New York, Monroe decided to give the film a publicity boost by doing something no major Hollywood actress had done before; in the scene in which Ellen is swimming in the pool at night, she calls playfully up to Nick's bedroom window and invites him to join her. Nick tells her to get out of the pool, then realizes she is nude. A body stocking was made for her, but Monroe took it off and swam around in only a flesh-colored bikini bottom. The set was closed to all but necessary crew, but Monroe had asked photographers, including William Woodfield, to come in. After filming was completed, Monroe was photographed in the bikini bottom, and without it.\n\nHad \"Something's Got to Give\" been completed and released as planned, Monroe would have been the first mainstream star shown topless in a Hollywood motion picture release of the sound era. Instead, that distinction goes to actress Jayne Mansfield in \"Promises! Promises!\" (1963).\n\nOn Friday, June 1, 1962, Monroe's 36th birthday, she, Martin and Wally Cox shot a scene in the courtyard set. Monroe's stand-in, Evelyn Moriarty, bought a seven-dollar sheet cake at the Los Angeles Farmers Market. A studio illustrator drew a cartoon of a nude Monroe holding a towel, which read \"Happy Birthday (Suit)\". It was to be used as a birthday card, and signed by the cast and crew. The cast attempted to celebrate when Monroe arrived, but Cukor insisted that they wait until 6:00 p.m. (the end of the working day) because he wanted to get a \"full day's work out of her.\"\n\nIt would be Monroe's last day on the set. She left the party with Cox, and had borrowed the fur-trimmed grey suit she had worn while filming that day because she was to attend a muscular dystrophy fundraiser at Dodger Stadium that evening with her former husband Joe DiMaggio and co-star Dean Martin's young son, Dean Paul Martin.\n\nOn Monday, June 4, 1962, Monroe phoned Henry Weinstein to inform him that she would not be on set that day once again. She had a flare-up of the sinusitis, and her temperature had reached 100 °F (37.8 °C). At a studio meeting, Cukor strongly endorsed her dismissal, and she was fired from the project on June 8, 1962. \"Life\" featured Marilyn, wrapped in a blue terrycloth robe, on its June 22, 1962 cover with the headline, \"The skinny dip you'll never see.\"\n\nThe decision to fire Monroe was influenced by the progress of Fox's epic film \"Cleopatra\", also in production that summer and far over its budget. Executives had planned a Christmas holiday release for \"Something's Got to Give\", as a source of revenue to offset \"Cleopatra\"'s increasing cost.\n\nMonroe quickly gave interviews and photo essays for \"Life\", \"Cosmopolitan\", and \"Vogue\" magazines. The \"Life\" interview with Richard Meryman, published on August 3, 1962 — just two days before her death — included her reflections on the positive and negative aspects of fame. \"Fame is fickle,\" she said. \"I now live in my work and in a few relationships with the few people I can really count on. Fame will go by, and so long, I've had you, fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle. So, at least it's something I experienced, but that's not where I live.\"\n\nAfter Monroe's dismissal, her role was offered to actresses Kim Novak and Shirley MacLaine, but both declined. It was soon reported that she was to be replaced with Lee Remick, who was fitted into Monroe's costumes and photographed with Cukor.\n\nDean Martin had final approval of his leading lady, and refused to continue without Monroe. Aside from being friends with Martin, Monroe had personally selected the cast (including Martin and Cox) over Fox's desire she do the film with James Garner and Don Knotts, the two stars who ended up in the Doris Day version. Fox relented and re-hired her, even agreeing to pay her \"more\" than her previous salary of $100,000, with the stipulation that she make this and one more film at $500,000 per film, plus a bonus if completed on time. The second film was slated to be \"What a Way to Go!\", which was eventually filmed with Shirley MacLaine. Monroe accepted the offer on the condition Cukor be replaced with Jean Negulesco, who had directed her in \"How to Marry a Millionaire\". Filming was set to resume in October, but no more work was done after Monroe's death on August 5.\n\nIn April 1963, Fox released the 83-minute documentary \"Marilyn\", which included brief clips from the screen tests and unfinished film showing Monroe. This was the only footage from the film seen by the public until the hour-long 1990 documentary \"Marilyn: Something's Got to Give\", which used extensive excerpts from the footage.\n\nFox later produced another version of the script by Arnold Schulman, who walked off the film when he saw what Fox was planning for Monroe. The Nunnally Johnson and Walter Bernstein scripts were rewritten by Hal Kanter and Jack Sher, more closely resembling the original 1940 film. Fox asked Kanter to fashion a film around all the existing film footage, and then release it without ever having to bring Monroe back, with a technique previously used for Jean Harlow in \"Saratoga\" that made use of a double for certain scenes. This request came despite Fox's insistence that only mere minutes existed of Monroe on film, despite there being crates full of scenes shot repeatedly with no perceptible difference. All this maneuvering was dropped after Monroe and Fox came to new terms on her adjusted contract. The newer version utilized some of the sets from the abandoned version, as well as costumes (with variations) and hairstyles designed for Monroe. Retitled \"Move Over, Darling\" and starring Doris Day, James Garner and Polly Bergen, the film was released by 20th Century Fox in December 1963.\n\nNine hours of unedited footage and separate sound tracks from the unfinished film remained in the vaults at 20th Century Fox until 1989, when the material was discovered by producers of Fox Entertainment News (FEN) and assembled into the one-hour documentary \"Marilyn: Something's Got to Give\". Commissioned by Fox chairman Barry Diller, the film first aired on Fox stations in 1990, written, produced and presented by Henry Schipper. The film sequences edited by FEN's post-production team were later repurposed by Prometheus Entertainment for the documentary \"Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days\", which aired on AMC on June 1, 2001, the 75th anniversary of Monroe's birth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1835627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835627", "title": "Antonio de Nebrija", "text": "Antonio de Nebrija\n\nAntonio de Nebrija (14445 July 1522) was the most influential Spanish humanist of his era. He wrote poetry, commented on literary works, and encouraged the study of classical languages and literature but his most important contributions were in the fields of grammar and lexicography. Nebrija was the author of the first Spanish grammar (1492) and the first dictionary of the Spanish language (1495). His grammar is also credited as the first published grammar of any Romance language. His chief works were published and republished many times during and after his life and his scholarship had a great influence for more than a century, both in Spain and in the expanding Spanish Empire.\n\nNebrija was baptized Antonio Martínez de Cala. In typical Renaissance humanist fashion, he Latinized his name as Aelius Antonius Nebrissensis (or Elio Antonio de Nebrija in Spanish) by taking \"Aelius\" from the Roman inscriptions of his native Lebrija, known in Roman times as Nebrissa Veneria. He was also known as Antonio de Lebrija, Antonius Nebrissensis, and Antonio de Lebrixa.\n\nNebrija was born into a \"hidalgo\" family in Nebrixa, a town now called Lebrija in the province of Seville. His parents were Juan Martínez de Cala and Catalina de Xarana. He was the second of five children. There is some uncertainty about his date of birth. Nebrija wrote that he was born the year before the Battle of Olmedo in 1445, putting his birthday in 1444 but elsewhere he makes other references that would contradict this date. Traditionally, 1444 has been accepted as his year of birth.\n\nAt age fourteen Nebrija enrolled at the University of Salamanca, where he studied mathematics, philosophy, law and theology. These latter topics earned him a scholarship from the bishopric of Seville to study theology at the Royal College of Spain in Bologna. Little is known about his studies in Italy except that he was inspired by the works of the Italian humanists, especially Lorenzo Valla. After ten years in Italy Nebrija returned to Spain armed with the new concepts of Renaissance humanism.\n\nOnce back in Spain, Nebrija served Alonso de Fonseca y Ulloa, archbishop of Seville, for three years. When Fonseca died in 1473, Nebrija returned to the University of Salamanca as a lecturer. In 1476 he was appointed First Chair of Grammar and in 1481 he published his first work, the \"Introductiones latinae\" (\"Introduction to Latin\"), a textbook on Latin grammar and literature. The first printing of 1,000 copies quickly sold out and was reprinted dozens of times in his lifetime.\n\nHe married Isabel Montesino de Solís in 1487 and eventually fathered seven children. When Juan de Zúñiga, the master of the Order of Alcántara, offered him patronage, Nebrija quit the university in Salamanca and moved to Badajoz, where he lived for the next twelve years.\n\nAfter the success of his Latin textbook, Nebrija's literary scholarship turned to focus on Castilian rather than classical languages. In 1492 he published \"Gramática de la lengua castellana\" (\"Grammar of the Castilian Language\"), which he dedicated to Queen Isabella I of Castile. His book was one of the first to codify a European vernacular language, and it ultimately had considerable political and scholarly influence. Nebrija recognized that language played a crucial role in governance of the state. In his dedication he wrote to Isabella that language was \"the instrument of empire\" and suggested that his grammar would prove useful as the Catholic Monarchs conquered peoples who spoke languages other than Castilian.\n\nIn 1492 Nebrija also published the \"Diccionario latino-español\" (\"Spanish-Latin Dictionary\"). It was not the first Latin-Spanish dictionary (Alfonso de Palencia published one in 1490) but it would become hugely influential, in part because a few years later he reversed the order and published his \"Vocabulario español-latino\" (\"Spanish-Latin Vocabulary\") in 1495. For the next century, the Spanish-Latin vocabulary continued to evolve with new words and translations. It also served as the basis for other authors developing non-Latin translating dictionaries including Spanish-Arabic (1505), Spanish-Nahuatl (1547) and Spanish-Tagalog (1613).\n\nAfter publishing his dictionaries Nebrija turned his attention to biblical scholarship. He wanted to improve the text and interpretation of the Bible by using the same critical analysis that Italian humanists had applied to classical literature. Around 1504 he fell under the suspicion of Diego de Deza, the Grand Inquisitor of Spain, who confiscated and destroyed his work. In 1507 Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros succeeded Deza as inquisitor general. Cisneros allowed Nebrija to resume his biblical studies and he eventually published a series of works that used the techniques of humanist scholarship to address problems of biblical translation and interpretation. Nebrija served briefly on the editorial committee assembled by Jiménez to prepare the Complutensian Polyglot Bible. He clashed with the more conservative editors, who resisted his humanist approach to translating the Bible. Jiménez supported the conservative viewpoint and Nebrija's input was largely ignored when the finished work was published in 1517.\n\nNebrija wrote or translated a large number of other works on a variety of subjects, including theology, law, archaeology, pedagogy, and commentaries on Sedulius and Persius.\n\nNebrija died on 5 July 1522 in Acala de Henares, Spain. His possible grandson Antonio de Lebrija was conquistador in Colombia and treasurer of the Spanish conquest of the Muisca expedition.\n\n\nEnglish\n\nSpanish\n\n\n"}

He worked 1906-1912 with Ernst Torulf in Stockholm and Gothenburg 1906-1912, and on his own from 1912 in Stockholm. He was appointed architect in the Office of the Chief Intendant in 1906 and professor of architecture in the Royal Swedish College of Art in 1916. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1917. In 1921 he was appointed Director General of the State Office of Construction (\"Byggnadsstyrelsen\").\n\nThe architect firm Tengbom & Torulf won second prize in the 1905 competition for the Stockholm City Hall building (after Ragnar Östberg), and in 1906 again second prize for the \"Engelbrektskyrkan\" (Engelbrekt Church) in Stockholm (built according to the design of Lars Israel Wahlman). They were more successful in the competition for the City Court building (\"rådhus\") in Borås in 1909, where they won first prize and were allowed to execute their design. Another public building designed by Tengbom in collaboration with Torulf was the new church in Arvika, completed in 1911. The two also received the commission to build a hunting lodge for Eric von Rosen in what is today Jaktstuguskogen Nature Reserve. The Trelleborg Water Tower was built after drawings by Tengbom and completed in 1912.\n\nAfter Tengbom left the collaboration with Torulf, he made the design for the main office of the Stockholms Enskilda Bank at the Kungsträdgården Park in Stockholm (1912–1915). Another Stockholm office for the bank, at Götgatan on Södermalm, was built according to Tengbom's design in 1916. Another bank office was the one designed for the Borås Enskilda Bank (1916). Other Tengbom buildings from the time period were that of the building for the daily newspaper \"Svenska Dagbladet\" at the street Karduansmakargatan in Stockholm, and the \"Högalidskyrkan\" (Högalid Church) in Stockholm (after winning first prize in a competition).\n\nIn the 1920s he made the design for the building of the Stockholm School of Economics (1925) and the Stockholm Concert Hall (1923–1926) at Hötorget Square. The home of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and known as the place where the Nobel Prize ceremony takes place, the Hall, a light-blue building with a portico with tall, slender polygonal columns with corinthian capitals. The concert hall is probably Tengbom's best-known building and, together with Gunnar Asplund's Stockholm Public Library, the most widely recognized example of the neo-classical architecture of the Swedish 1920s, in English referred to as \"Swedish Grace\".\n\nIn the last years of the 1920s, he designed the main office of Ivar Kreuger's corporation Svenska Tändsticksbolaget at Trädgårdsgatan in Stockholm. His later production includes the building for the Swedish Institute at Rome 1938-1940. He was awarded one of the inaugural Prince Eugen Medals in 1945 for architecture.\n\nHis son Anders Tengbom (1911–2009) was also, in his own right, a very famous architect. One of his greatest creations was Bonnierhuset, one of the tallest buildings in Stockholm. His daughter, Ann-Mari Tengbom, married Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835644", "title": "Findern", "text": "Findern\n\nFindern is a village and civil parish in the District of South Derbyshire, approximately 5–6 miles south of Derby (Grid reference: ). The population of the civil parish was 1,669 at the 2011 Census. The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book, when it was held by Burton Abbey as an outlier of Mickleover. A priory once stood near the church, where the monks were supplied with fresh food from the fishponds on Common Piece Lane. After the dissolution of the abbey the Fynderne family, as the principal land-owners, took ownership of the village and the remaining Chapel of Ease. The Fyndernes lived in a fortified manor house on Castle Hill, though none of the house remains.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Sir Geoffrey de Fynderne left the village to join the Crusades, and brought back the Findern Flower, which in the UK only grows in the village, and only in particular areas. The flower has become an emblem of the village and is represented in many guises, including the emblem of Findern Primary School on Heath Lane.\n\nAll Saints' parish church was rebuilt and consecrated in 1863, on the site of a Saxon chapel of ease, destroyed by fire. Built of sandstone, it stands adjacent to the village green. The church contains a monument to Isabella de Fynderne dated 1444, and also possesses the oldest parish communion plate in the UK. Findern also has a small Methodist chapel, built in 1835, close to the site of the old priory. The village previously also had an early 18th century Unitarian chapel, built just over five miles from Derby. At that time the law decreed that no Dissenting meeting house should be built less than that distance from the town. It was demolished in 1939.\n\nPrior to the development of transport, the village was self-supporting and it was here, in 1740, that Jedediah Strutt came as an apprentice wheelwright. He had an obsessive interest in machinery, but when his uncle died and left him a small holding, he took it over and returned to Findern to marry Elizabeth Woollatt who lived at the old hall, where he had previously lodged. Later he went on to set up the mills and their communities at Belper and Milford, which now form an integral part of the Derwent Valley World Heritage Site.\n\nThe village historically had a strong weaving industry, with the majority of the cottages around the Green housing the looms. In 1846 there were as many as 22 velvet and silk looms in the village, but weaving had been known to have taken place in Findern as early as the 17th century Ivy Cottage, one of the oldest surviving properties in the village.\n\nIn 1694 an early school was started here by Rev. Benjamin Robinson, the local presbyterian minister (for which he was summoned to explain why to the bishop). Modern Secondary education is now provided for many at John Port School in the nearby village of Etwall.\n\nAlthough all industry has left the village the Green remains the still the centre of the village, with the post office, village store and a handful of other services. Before the Parish Council took action in the 1950s to restore it the Green was in poor shape, divided into four small grassed areas, divided by tarmac paths and frequently used by vehicles. There were no records as to owned the land until ownership was traced to the Crown, and the land purchased for £50 by the Parish Council for the village.\n\nThere is a Neolithic cursus 1 ½ miles south of the village.\n\nFindern previously had two pubs, the 'Wheel Inn' located on Main Street just off Longlands Lane and a second, formerly the 'Greyhound' on the bankside of the Trent and Mersey Canal. In addition to this a house located on the far-side of the canal was historically the oldest pub in the village.\n\nThe village is nowadays bounded on two sides by major A roads; the A38 and the A50. The former, to the north east, follows the course of the Roman road Icknield Street, while the latter passes to the south of the village centre and runs parallel to the canal. In contrast to the ancient route of the A38 the A50 road was laid only in 1997, with many villagers unhappy about the loss of fields and pleasant walks as a result.

They include more than 160 Golden Age and Silver Age comic properties currently owned by DC Comics, regardless of whether DC Comics was the original publisher. The series first published \"Superman Archives Vol. 1\" in 1989. Most of the restoration work to make the pages suitable for quality printing has been done by Rick Keene, who has restored more than 2,500 pages.\n\n The \"DC Archive Editions\" (DCAE) series spans DC's Golden Age—which is actually the output of three inter-related companies in the late 1930s and the early '40s: Max Gaines' All-American Publications (Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Wonder Woman; All Star Comics starring the Justice Society of America, et al.); and Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications, which became Harry Donenfeld's Detective Comics (Batman, Superman, et al.)—as well as Silver and Bronze Age comic book series such as \"Legion of Super-Heroes\", \"Challengers of the Unknown\", \"Doom Patrol\", \"Metal Men\", \"Aquaman\", \"Justice League of America\", et al.\n\nThe series' format was designed by Alex Jay with Richard Bruning providing the art direction. Its various volumes also include series/titles not originally published by DC, though bought up in the intervening years, such as: Golden Age characters Plastic Man and Blackhawk, originally published by Quality Comics; the \"Shazam\" Marvel Family of characters Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel, originally published by Fawcett; and the Charlton Silver Age line of superheroes (Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, The Question, et al.) in the DCAE Action Heroes volumes.\n\nThe \"DC Archives\" preserve DC's history and provide readers with stories that normally would not be available. When the series first started, the cover price was U.S. $39.95; however, in the early 1990s the standard cover price became U.S. $49.99, although some books in the line containing more content have cost much more (with a higher page count and higher cover price). Since 2009, new volumes have been released with a cover price of U.S. $59.99.\n\nIn the early to mid-2000s, newer printings of previously published \"DC Archives\" volumes were released at the special introductory cover price of U.S. $19.95. In 2001, excess stock of \"Batman Archives Vol. 1\" (originally released back in 1990) first printing edition was sold for this reduced price, with a new price sticker placed on the book's shrink wrap. Sales proved successful, as the remaining inventory sold out. DC used this promotional price again with a second printing of \"Batman Archives Vol. 1\" in 2003 (only pre-ordered copies of this second printing for the direct market were at this lower price, while the remaining stock for the bookstore market was at the regular U.S. 49.99 price), \"Superman Archives Vol. 1\" (fifth printing) in 2004, and \"Batman: The Dark Knight Archives Vol. 1\" (third printing) in 2005.\n\nIt was widely believed that the \"DC Archive Editions\" would cease publication in 2008. However, in an issue of the publication \"Comic Shop News\" (issue #1080, February 27, 2008), an update was provided: \"In spite of earlier reports of their demise, DC Archives will continue in 2008 and 2009, although in reduced numbers, focusing on continuing already-established Archives' series. The numbers have since decreased from fourteen volumes released in 2007, to seven released in 2008, five in 2009, four in 2010, and three in 2011, before rebounding in 2012 with ten volumes. In 2013, the volume length was increased to 400 pages, but only three volumes were released. The most recent volume, \"Superman: The Man of Tomorrow Archives\" Vol. 3 was released in 2014. A \"Captain Comet Archive\" Vol. 1 and \"Batman: World's Finest\" Vol. 3 were both solicited by DC for release in 2013, but both were canceled prior to release and have yet to be rescheduled. \n\nPost-2014, with no new \"DC Archive Editions\" released, DC has instead published the hardcover \"DC Omnibus\" line, with various titles/characters from the Golden Age, the Silver Age, and the Bronze Age eras, and each \"Age\" era Omnibus volume is also published as two or three (depending on page count) trade paperbacks, replacing the \"DC Archive Editions\" line. \n\n\"Will Eisner's The Spirit Archives\", \"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents Archives\", \"Mad Archives\", and \"Elfquest Archives\" are not technically part of the formal \"DC Archive Editions\" series (DCAEs are typified by a cover format consisting of a black pinstriped background onto which a colored v-shaped area is overlaid from the top, reaching almost to the bottom for all books) as DC does not own those properties/characters, and is licensing them from the copyright holders. In the case of \"Mad\", the property is owned by DC's parent company, but not DC itself. The licensing for the \"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\" works is held by IDW as of 2012. However, these non-\"DC Archive Editions\" series published by DC are included in the list here, as the physical format (paper stock, size dimension, etc.) is similar enough that the average fan would consider them part of the overall \"DC Archive Editions\" series.\n\nThe first volume of the \"Plastic Man Archives\" won the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album in 2001.\n\n\nhttp://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/4367-dc-trade-book-collections-go-deluxe.html\n\n"}

{"id": "1835661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835661", "title": "Teichmüller space", "text": "Teichmüller space\n\nIn mathematics, the Teichmüller space formula_1 of a (real) topological (or differential) surface formula_2, is a space that parametrizes complex structures on formula_2 up to the action of homeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity homeomorphism. Each point in formula_1 may be regarded as an isomorphism class of \"marked\" Riemann surfaces, where a \"marking\" is an isotopy class of homeomorphisms from formula_2 to itself.\n\nIt can also be viewed as a moduli space for marked hyperbolic structure on the surface, and this endows it with a natural topology for which it is homeomorphic to a ball of dimension formula_6 for a surface of genus formula_7. In this way Teichmüller space can be viewed as the universal covering orbifold of the Riemann moduli space.\n\nThe Teichmüller space has a canonical complex manifold structure and a wealth of natural metrics. The study of geometric features of these various structures is a very rich subject of research.\n\nTeichmüller spaces are named after Oswald Teichmüller.\n\nModuli spaces for Riemann surfaces and related Fuchsian groups have been studied since the work of Bernhard Riemann, who knew that formula_6 parameters were needed to describe the variations of complex structures on a surface of genus formula_9. The early study of Teichmüller space, in the late nineteenth–early twentieth century, was geometric and founded on the interpretation of Riemann surfaces as hyperbolic surfaces. Among the main contributors were Felix Klein, Henri Poincaré, Paul Koebe, Jakob Nielsen, Robert Fricke and Werner Fenchel.\n\nThe main contribution of Teichmüller to the study of moduli was the introduction of quasiconformal mappings to the subject. They allow us to give much more depth to the study of moduli spaces by endowing them with additional features that were not present in the previous, more elementary works. After World War II the subject was developed further in this analytic vein, in particular by Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers. The theory continues to be active, with numerous studies of the complex structure of Teichmüller space (introduced by Bers).\n\nThe geometric vein in the study of Teichmüller space was revived following the work of William Thurston in the late seventies, who introduced a geometric compactification which he used in his study of the mapping class group of a surface. Other more combinatorial objects associated to this group (in particular the curve complex) have also been related to Teichmüller space, and this is a very active subject of research in geometric group theory.\n\nLet formula_2 be an orientable smooth surface (a differentiable manifold of dimension 2). Informally the Teichmüller space formula_1 of formula_2 is the space of Riemann surface structures on formula_2 up to isotopy.\n\nFormally it can be defined as follows. Two complex structures formula_14 on formula_2 are said to be equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism formula_16 such that:\n\n\n\nThen formula_1 is the space of equivalence classes of complex structures on formula_2 for this relation.\n\nAnother equivalent definition is as follows: formula_1 is the space of pairs formula_25 where formula_17 is a Riemann surface and formula_27 a diffeomorphism, and two pairs formula_28 are regarded as equivalent if formula_29 is isotopic to a holomorphic diffeomorphism. Such a pair is called a \"marked Riemann surface\"; the \"marking\" being the diffeomeorphism; another definition of markings is by systems of curves.\n\nThere are two simple examples that are immediately computed from the Uniformisation theorem: there is a unique complex structure on the sphere formula_30 (see Riemann sphere) and there are two on formula_31 (the complex plane and the unit disk) and in each case the group of positive diffeomorphisms is contractible. Thus the Teichmüller space of formula_30 is a single point and that of formula_31 contains exactly two points.\n\nA slightly more involved example is the open annulus, for which the Teichmüller space is the interval formula_34 (the complex structure associated to formula_35 is the Riemann surface formula_36).\n\nThe next example is the torus formula_37 In this case any complex structure can be realised by a Riemann surface of the form formula_38 (a complex elliptic curve) for a complex number formula_39 where \n\nis the complex upper half-plane. Then we have a bijection:\n\nand thus the Teichmüller space of formula_42 is formula_43\n\nIf we identify formula_44 with the Euclidean plane then each point in Teichmüller space can also be viewed as a marked flat structure on formula_45 Thus the Teichmüller space is in bijection with the set of pairs formula_46 where formula_47 is a flat surface and formula_48 is a diffeomorphism up to isotopy on formula_49.\n\nThese are the surfaces for which Teichmüller space is most often studied, which include closed surfaces. A surface is of finite type if it is diffeomorphic to a compact surface minus a finite set. If formula_2 is a closed surface of genus formula_51 then the surface obtained by removing formula_52 points from formula_2 is usually denoted formula_54 and its Teichmüller space by formula_55\n\nEvery finite type orientable surface other than the ones above admits complete Riemannian metrics of constant curvature formula_56. For a given surface of finite type there is a bijection between such metrics and complex structures as follows from the uniformisation theorem. Thus if formula_57 the Teichmüller space formula_58 can be realised as the set of marked hyperbolic surfaces of genus formula_51 with formula_52 cusps, that is the set of pairs formula_61 where formula_47 is an hyperbolic surface and formula_63 is a diffeomorphism, modulo the equivalence relation where formula_61 and formula_65 are identified is formula_66 is isotopic to an isometry.\n\nIn all cases computed above there is an obvious topology on Teichmüller space. In the general case there are many natural ways to topologise formula_1, perhaps the simplest is via hyperbolic metrics and length functions.\n\nIf formula_68 is a closed curve on formula_2 and formula_70 a marked hyperbolic surface then one formula_71 is homotopic to a unique closed geodesic formula_72 on formula_47 (up to parametrisation). The value at formula_74 of the \"length function\" associated to (the homotopy class of) formula_68 is then:\n\nLet formula_77 be the set of simple closed curves on formula_2. Then the map \n\nis an embedding. The space formula_80 has the product topology and formula_1 is endowed with the induced topology. With this topology formula_82 is homeomorphic to formula_83\n\nIn fact one can obtain an embedding with formula_84 curves, and even formula_85. In both case one can use the embedding to give a geometric proof of the homeomorphism above.\n\nThere is a unique complete hyperbolic metric on the three-holed sphere and so the Teichmüller space formula_86 is a point (this also follows from the dimension formula of the previous paragraph).\n\nThe Teichmüller spaces formula_87 and formula_88 are naturally realised as the upper half-plane, as can be seen using Fenchel–Nielsen coordinates.\n\nInstead of complex structures of hyperbolic metrics one can define Teichmüller space using conformal structures. Indeed, conformal structures are the same as complex structures in two (real) dimensions. Moreover, the Uniformisation Theorem also implies that in each conformal class of Riemannian metrics on a surface there is a unique metric of constant curvature.\n\nYet another interpretation of Teichmüller space is as a representation space for surface groups. If formula_2 is hyperbolic, of finite type and formula_90 is the fundamental group of formula_2 then Teichmüller space is in natural bijection with: \nThe map sends a marked hyperbolic structure formula_61 to the composition formula_99 where formula_100 is the monodromy of the hyperbolic structure and formula_101 is the isomorphism induced by formula_49.\n\nNote that this realises formula_1 as a closed subset of formula_104 which endows it with a topology. This can be used to see the homeomorphism formula_105 directly.\n\nThis interpretation of Teichmüller space is generalised by higher Teichmüller theory, where the group formula_93 is replaced by an arbitrary semisimple Lie group.\n\nAll definitions above can be made in the topological category instead of the category of differentiable manifolds, and this does not change the objects.\n\nSurfaces which are not of finite type also admit hyperbolic structures, which can be parametrised by infinite-dimensional spaces (homeomorphic to formula_107). Another example of infinite-dimensional space related to Teichmüller theory is the Teichmüller space of a lamination by surfaces.\n\nThere is a map from Teichmüller space to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces diffeomorphic to formula_2, defined by formula_109. It is a covering map, and since formula_1 is simply connected it is the orbifold universal cover for the moduli space.\n\nThe mapping class group of formula_2 is the coset group formula_112 of the diffeomorphism group of formula_2 by the normal subgroup of those that are isotopic to the identity (the same definition can be made with homeomorphisms instead of diffeomorphisms and this does not change the resulting group). The group of diffeomorphisms acts naturally on Teichmüller space by \nIf formula_115 is a mapping class and formula_116 two diffeomorphisms representing it then they are isotopic. Thus the classes of formula_117 and formula_118 are the same in Teichmüller space, and the action above factorises through the mapping class group.\n\nThe action of the mapping class group formula_112 on the Teichmüller space is properly discontinuous, and the quotient is the moduli space.\n\nThe Nielsen realisation problem asks whether any finite group of the mapping class group has a global fixed point (a point fixed by all group elements) in Teichmüller space. In more classical terms the question is: can every finite subgroup of formula_112 be realised as a group of isometries of some complete hyperbolic metric on formula_2 (or equivalently as a group of holomorphic diffeomorphisms of some complex structure). This was solved by Steven Kerckhoff.\n\nThe Fenchel–Nielsen coordinates (so named after Werner Fenchel and Jakob Nielsen) on the Teichmüller space formula_1 are associated to a pants decomposition of the surface formula_2. This is a decomposition of formula_2 into pairs of pants, and to each curve in the decomposition is associated its length in the hyperbolic metric corresponding to the point in Teichmüller space, and another real parameter called the twist which is more involved to define.\n\nIn case of a closed surface of genus formula_51 there are formula_126 curves in a pants decomposition and we get formula_6 parameters, which is the dimension of formula_128. The Fenchel–Nielsen coordinates in fact define a homeomorphism formula_129.\n\nIn the case of a surface with punctures some pairs of pants are \"degenerate\" (they have a cusp) and give only two length and twist parameters. Again in this case the Fenchel–Nielsen coordinates define a homeomorphism formula_130.\n\nIf formula_131 the surface formula_132 admits ideal triangulations (whose vertices are exactly the punctures). By the formula for the Euler characteristic such a triangulation has formula_133 triangles. An hyperbolic structure formula_47 on formula_2 determines an (unique up to isotopy) diffeomorphism formula_136 sending every triangle to an hyperbolic ideal triangle, thus a point in formula_1. The parameters for such a structure are the translation lengths for each pair of sides of the triangles glued in the triangulation. There are formula_138 such parameters which can each take any value in formula_139, and the completeness of the structure corresponds to a linear equation and thus we get the right dimension formula_140. These coordinates are called \"shear coordinates\".\n\nFor closed surfaces, a pair of pants can be decomposed as the union of two ideal triangles (it can be seen as an incomplete hyperbolic metric on the three-holed sphere). Thus we also get formula_126 shear coordinates on formula_128.\n\nA simple \"earthquake path\" in Teichmüller space is a path determined by varying a single shear or length Fenchel–Nielsen coordinate (for a fixed ideal triangulation of a surface). The name comes from seeing the ideal triangles or the pants as tectonic plates and the shear as plate motion.\n\nMore generally one can do earthquakes along geodesic laminations. A theorem of Thurston then states that two points in Teichmüller space are joined by a unique earthquake path.\n\nA quasiconformal mapping between two Riemann surfaces is a homeomorphism which deforms the conformal structure in a bounded manner over the surface. More precisely it is differentiable almost everywhere and there is a constant formula_143, called the \"dilatation\", such that \n\nwhere formula_145 are the derivatives in a conformal coordinate formula_146 and its conjugate formula_147.\n\nThere are quasi-conformal mappings in every isotopy class and so an alternative definition for The Teichmüller space is as follows. Fix a Riemann surface formula_17 diffeomorphic to formula_2, and Teichmüller space is in natural bijection with the marked surfaces formula_150 where formula_151 is a quasiconformal mapping, up to the same equivalence relation as above.\n\nWith the definition above, if formula_152 there is a natural map from Teichmüller space to the space of formula_95-equivariant solutions to the Beltrami differential equation. These give rise, via the Schwarzian derivative, to quadratic differentials on formula_17. The space of those is a complex space of complex dimension formula_126, and the image of Teichmüller space is an open set. This map is called the Bers embedding.\n\nA quadratic differential on formula_17 can be represented by a translation surface conformal to formula_17.\n\nTeichmüller's theorem states that between two marked Riemann surfaces formula_25 and formula_159 there is always a unique quasiconformal mapping formula_160 in the isotopy class of formula_161 which has minimal dilatation. This map is called a Teichmüller mapping.\n\nIn the geometric picture this means that for every two diffeomorphic Riemann surfaces formula_14 and diffeomorphism formula_163 there exists two polygons representing formula_14 and an affine map sending one to the other, which has smallest dilatation among all quasiconformal maps formula_160.\n\nIf formula_166 and the Teichmüller mapping between them has dilatation formula_167 then the Teichmüller distance between them is by definition formula_168. This indeed defines a distance on formula_1 which induces its topology, and for which it is complete. This is the metric most commonly used for the study of the metric geometry of Teichmüller space. In particular it is of interest to geometric group theorists.\n\nThere is a function similarly defined, using the Lipschitz constants of maps between hyperbolic surfaces instead of the quasiconformal dilatations, on formula_170, which is not symmetric.\n\nQuadratic differentials on a Riemann surface formula_17 are identified with the tangent space at formula_172 to Teichmüller space. The Weil–Petersson metric is the Riemannian metric defined by the formula_173 inner product on quadratic differentials.\n\nThere are several inequivalent compactifications of Teichmüller spaces that have been studied. Several of the earlier compactifications depend on the choice of a point in Teichmüller space so are not invariant under the modular group, which can be inconvenient. William Thurston later found a compactification without this disadvantage, which has become the most widely used compactification.\n\nBy looking at the hyperbolic lengths of simple closed curves for each point in Teichmüller space and taking the closure in the (infinite-dimensional) projective space, introduced a compactification whose points at infinity correspond to projective measured laminations. The compactified space is homeomorphic to a closed ball. This Thurston compactification is acted on continuously by the modular group. In particular any element of the modular group has a fixed point in Thurston's compactification, which Thurston used in his classification of elements of the modular group.\n\nThe Bers compactification is given by taking the closure of the image of the Bers embedding of Teichmüller space, studied by . The Bers embedding depends on the choice of a point in Teichmüller space so is not invariant under the modular group, and in fact the modular group does not act continuously on the Bers compactification.\n\nThe \"points at infinity\" in the Teichmüller compactification consist of geodesic rays (for the Teichmüller metric) starting at a fixed basepoint. This compactification depends on the choice of basepoint so is not acted on by the modular group, and in fact Kerckhoff showed that the action of the modular group on Teichmüller space does not extend to a continuous action on this compactification.\n\n considered a compactification similar to the Thurston compactification, but using extremal length rather than hyperbolic length. The modular group acts continuously on this compactification, but they showed that their compactification has strictly more points at infinity.\n\nThere has been an extensive study of the geometric properties of Teichmüller space endowed with the Teichmüller metric. Known large-scale properties include:\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Teichmüller space exhibits several properties characteristic of hyperbolic spaces, such as:\n\n\n\nSome of these features can be explained by the study of maps from Teichmüller space to the curve complex, which is known to be hyperbolic.\n\nThe Bers embedding gives formula_1 a complex structure as an open subset of formula_181\n\nSince Teichmüller space is a complex manifold it carries a Carathéodory metric. Teichmüller space is Kobayashi hyperbolic and its Kobayashi metric coincides with the Teichmüller metric. This latter result is used in Royden's proof that the mapping class group is the full group of isometries for the Teichmüller metric.\n\nThe Bers embedding realises Teichmüller space as a domain of holomorphy and hence it also carries a Bergman metric.\n\nThe Weil–Petersson metric is Kähler but it is not complete.\n\nCheng and Yau showed that there is a unique complete Kähler–Einstein metric on Teichmüller space. It has constant negative scalar curvature.\n\nTeichmüller space also carries a complete Kähler metric of bounded sectional curvature introduced by that is Kähler-hyperbolic.\n\nWith the exception of the incomplete Weil–Petersson metric, all metrics on Teichmüller space introduced here are quasi-isometric to each other.\n\n\n\n"}

Built with red brick and stone dressings in Tudor gothic style, with side and rear extensions in late 19th and early 20th centuries. The landscaped grounds are also Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nThe original Bagshot Lodge was built between 1631–33 as one of a series of small lodges designed for King Charles I by Inigo Jones. It was remodelled between 1766 and 1772 according to designs of James Paine for George Keppel, the 3rd Earl of Albemarle, and altered in 1798 by Sir John Soane for the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV), who lived there until 1816.\n\nBagshot Park was subsequently used by Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester, nephew of King George III. The Duke added pieces of property between the estate and Sunningdale; his widow, Princess Mary, daughter of King George III, continued to live there after his death until she moved out in 1847. The original house was demolished in 1877–78.\n\nA new building with 120 rooms was completed in 1879.

A coachman and seven grooms lived in the stables. Two other domestic staff lived in one of the lodges, three agricultural workers lived in another, and one gardener is recorded as living on the estate. From 1880 this was the principal residence of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, a son of Queen Victoria. The Duke, who was Governor General of Canada from 1911 until 1916, died at Bagshot Park in 1942. The property had been in grace and favour occupation.\n\nFollowing the Duke's death, Bagshot Park was requisitioned by the Army for the Auxiliary Territorial Service (later to become the WRAC) to use as their Staff College. This closed at the end of the war.\n\nIn 1946 King George VI offered the house to the Royal Army Chaplains' Department to be used as a Church House and Chaplains' Depot. The Army Chaplains were in residence from 1947 but relocated to Andover, Hampshire, in April 1996, shortly before the Earl and Countess of Wessex took over the tenancy. The Army Chaplains famously placed a notice by the pond reading \"\"Please do not walk on the water\"\". The original sign was removed when the chaplains left, but a new one, made by J. M. J. Holland Chairmakers and given to the Earl of Wessex, has replaced it.\n\nAlthough the house was criticised as ugly by the architectural historian Professor Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, it was said to be the most adventurous royal house to be created since the death of Albert, the Prince Consort of Queen Victoria, in 1861. It is also a remarkable monument in the history of Indian taste in Britain: an Indian billiard room wing, which inspired the more famous Durbar Room at Osborne House, was prefabricated in India and installed in the 1880s. This was a result of the Duke of Connaught's Indian tour, when the Duke met John Lockwood Kipling and asked him to design and oversee the installation of a billiard room in Indian taste. The Indian craftsmen who assembled and installed the room at Bagshot were housed in a tent in the grounds. The work took two years and was a wedding gift from Indian princes to the Duke and Duchess of Connaught.\n\nIn March 1998, the Mansion House at Bagshot Park, including a block of stables and Sunningdale Lodge, was leased by the Crown Estate to Prince Edward for 50 years. The Mansion House was renovated as a residence for the prince. The renovation was partly funded by the Crown Estate and partly funded by Prince Edward. The renovation was originally estimated to cost £2.18m, with £1.6m from the Crown Estate and the remainder being paid by the prince. The National Audit Office (NAO) report on the transaction states that the final cost of renovations was £2.98m; the Crown Estate paid £1.6m and the estimated excess of £1.38m was paid by Prince Edward. \nThe prince rented it from the Crown Estate initially for £5,000 a year then after renovation rising to £90,000 a year subject to 15-year rent reviews linked to RPI. According to the NAO report, the property leased by the prince does not include commercial farmland or woodland. The lease agreement permits subletting of the stable block.\n\nPrince Edward has since extended the lease to 150 years for £5m.\n\n\n"}

It is a primitive Greek Revival house built in the 1840s by Robert Sheegog. Faulkner purchased the house when it was in disrepair in the 1930s and did many of the renovations himself. Other renovations were done in the 1950s. The house sits on 4 landscaped and twenty nine acres of largely wooded property known as Bailey's Woods. One of its more famous features is the outline of Faulkner's Pulitzer Prize–winning novel \"A Fable\", penciled in graphite and red on the plaster wall of his study. Though the \"rowan oak\" is a mythical tree, the grounds and surrounding woods of Rowan Oak contain hundreds of species of native Mississippi plants, most of which date back to antebellum times. The alley of cedars that lines the driveway was common in the 19th century. The studs of the house are 4\"x4\" square cypress, which were hand-hewn. Faulkner drew much inspiration for his treatment of multi-layered Time from Rowan Oak, where past and future seemed to inhabit the present.\n\nIn 1972, his daughter, Jill Faulkner Summers, sold the house to the University of Mississippi. The University maintains the home in order to promote Faulkner's literary heritage. Tours are available. The home has been visited by such writers as John Updike, Czesław Miłosz, Charles Simic, Richard Ford, James Lee Burke, Bei Dao, Charles Wright, Charles Frazier, Alice Walker, the Coen brothers, Bobbie Ann Mason, Salman Rushdie, and others. Writer Mark Richard once repaired a faulty doorknob on the French door to Faulkner's study.\n\nRowan Oak was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968.\nAfter its most recent renovations, some of which were funded by part-time Oxford resident and Ole Miss law school alumnus, John Grisham, Rowan Oak was rededicated on May 1, 2005.\n\nThe current curator of Rowan Oak is William Griffith. Past curators include the novelists Howard Bahr and Cynthia Shearer. The original curator was Bev Smith, an Ole Miss alum, who was responsible for finding a great deal of Faulkner's original manuscripts hidden within the home.\n\n"}

Skippy is best known for the role of the pet dog \"Asta\" in the 1934 detective comedy \"The Thin Man\", starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. Due to the popularity of the role, Skippy is sometimes credited as Asta in public and in other films.\n\nSkippy was trained by his owners Henry East and Gale Henry East, and also by Frank Weatherwax, and assistant trainers Rudd Weatherwax, and Frank Inn.\n\nIn 1936, Skippy and several other movie dogs were profiled in the book \"Dog Stars of Hollywood\" by Gertrude Orr. At the time Skippy was said to be four and a half years old, giving him a birth year of 1931–32. He was said to be one of the most intelligent of animal stars then working in pictures. In addition to verbal commands, he also worked to hand cues, essential for a dog performing in sound films. His training began when he was three months old, and he made his first professional film appearances at the age of one year, in 1932–33, as a bit player providing \"atmosphere.\" In Orr's book Skippy was shown in a series of publicity shots with Wendy Barrie in \"It's a Small World\", Mae Clarke in \"The Daring Young Man\" and Mary Carlisle in an unidentified film. He became a star overnight in \"The Thin Man\" (1934).\n\nSkippy also made a hit as \"Mr. Smith\" in the 1937 film \"The Awful Truth\", in which his character was the subject of a custody dispute between characters portrayed by Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. (In a gaffe, Cary Grant wrestles and plays with \"Mr. Smith\" but can be heard distinctly calling him \"Skippy\".)\n\nIn \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), Skippy played \"George,\" the bone-hiding pup belonging to Katharine Hepburn's aunt. In \"Topper Takes a Trip\" (1938), he was \"Mr. Atlas\". \n\n\"The American Magazine\" detailed Skippy's professional life in an August 1938 profile of the East kennels, titled \"A Dog's Life in Hollywood\":\n\nMovie actresses stroke Skippy lovingly. They coo at him and murmur endearing terms in his ears. He takes it all in his stride, because, what with contracts, options, and exacting work before the movie cameras, he hasn't much time for the attentions of Hollywood's most beautiful stars. But if he's paid for it and given the proper cue he will snuggle in the arms of the loveliest of stars, gaze into her limpid eyes, and, if necessary—howl.\n\nSkippy, a smart little wire-haired terrier, is one of the leading stars in pictures. He leads a glamorous life—a dog's life de luxe. He is rated as one of the smartest dogs in the world, and when contracts are signed for his appearance in a picture he gets $200 a week for putting his paw-print on the dotted line. His trainer gets a mere $60.\n\nHis owner is Mrs. Gale Henry East, once a prominent movie comedienne...When Skippy has to drink water in a scene, the first time he does it he really drinks. If there are retakes and he's had all the water he can drink, he'll go through the scene just as enthusiastically as though his throat were parched, but he'll fake it. If you watch closely you'll see he's just going through the motions of lapping and isn't really picking up water at all. And, because he has a sense of humor, he loves it when you laugh and tell him you've caught him faking but that it's all right with you.\n\n\"Treat a dog kindly and he'll do anything in the world for you.\"\n\nAt a time when most canine actors in Hollywood films earned $3.50 a day, Skippy's weekly salary was $250.00.\n\nAs a character in the movie \"The Thin Man\", Asta was the playful pet dog of Nick and Nora Charles, tugging them around town on his walks, hiding from danger, and sniffing out corpses. (\"Asta, you're not a terrier, you're a police dog,\" Nick tells him.) The character later appeared in the sequels \"After the Thin Man\", \"Another Thin Man\", \"Shadow of the Thin Man\", \"The Thin Man Goes Home\", \"Song of the Thin Man\", as well as the 1950s television show \"The Thin Man\".\n\nLoy wrote that the actors were not allowed to interact with Skippy between takes; the Easts felt it would break his concentration. Skippy once bit Loy during filming.\n\nThe original character of Asta in Dashiell Hammett's book of \"The Thin Man\" was not a male Wire-Haired Fox Terrier, but a female Schnauzer. Due to the enormous popularity of the Asta character as played by Skippy, interest in pet terriers skyrocketed. Asta's enduring fame is such that the name is a frequent answer in \"The New York Times\" crossword puzzles (crosswordese), in response to clues such as \"Thin Man dog\" or \"Dog star.\" \n\nSkippy played Asta in the first three \"Thin Man\" films. Other terriers, trained by the Weatherwax family and by Frank Inn, took on the role in subsequent films of the series, and in the television show.\n"}

In 2019, its four reactors produced more than 50% of Hungary's electricity production.\n\nVVER is the Soviet designation for a pressurized water reactor. The number following VVER, in this case 440, represents the power output of the original design. The VVER-440 Model V213 was a product of the first uniform safety requirements drawn up by the Soviet designers. This model includes added emergency core cooling and auxiliary feedwater systems as well as upgraded accident localization systems.\n\nEach reactor contains 42 tons of lightly enriched uranium dioxide fuel. Fuel takes on average three years to be used (or \"burned\") in the reactors; after this the fuel rods are stored for five years in an adjacent cooling pond before being removed from the site for permanent disposal.\n\nThe power plant is nearly 100% owned by state-owned power wholesaler Magyar Villamos Művek. A few shares are held by local municipalities, while a voting preference or \"golden\" share is held by the Hungarian government.\n\nOne brand-new Reactor pressure vessel was bought from Poland after the Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant project was abandoned in 1990.\n\nIn 2000, the Paks Nuclear Power Plant commissioned a feasibility study which concluded that the plant may remain in operation for another 20 years beyond the original 30-year design lifetime. The study was updated in 2005 with similar conclusions.\nIn November 2005, Hungary's Parliament passed a resolution with overwhelming bipartisan majority to support the lifetime extension.\nThe feasibility study concluded that the non-replaceable parts are in sufficient condition to remain in operation for another 20 years while a minority of replaceable parts needed replacement or refurbishment.\n\nThe power generator made repeated surveys of public opinion on the lifetime extension and concluded that support for the decision hovered near 70%.\n\nFollowing the Fukushima I nuclear accidents in March 2011, Hungary's government said it would conduct a stress test on the Paks Nuclear Power Plant to assess safety, but it would not abandon plans for lifetime extension and it would also go ahead with plans for its expansion.\n\nUnit 1 was granted a license-extension to 2032 in 2012, unit 2 to 2034 in 2014, and unit 3 to 2036 in 2016. Unit 4 got its license extended till 2037 in 2017.\n\nThe nine Ganz power generators will be serviced by Alstom one per year between 2013 and 2021.\n\nThanks to optimizations, modernization and fuel upgrades it was possible to safely increase the output power of the Unit 4 reactor to 500 MWe in 2006, followed by Unit 1 in 2007. With upgrades to the remaining two units the plant's power generation reached 2000 MWe in 2009.\n\nOn 30 March 2009 the National Assembly of Hungary gave its principal consent by votes 330 for, 6 against and 10 abstentions to the preparation works of the possible new units. On 26 February 2010 the owner state company MVM Group decided the expansion with about 2000 billion Hungarian Forints price.\n\nOn 18 June 2012 the Hungarian government ranked Paks expansion as a \"high priority project of the national economy\", in this context established a committee (Nuclear Power Governmental Committee) for prepare the factual steps. The Nuclear Power Governmental Committee is headed by Viktor Orbán (Prime Minister) and has two members; Mihály Varga (Minister of National Economy) and Zsuzsanna Németh (National Developmental Minister). As of 2016, Hungary is said to import 30% of its electricity.\n\nAccording to the agreement signed by Zsuzsanna Németh (National Developmental Minister of Hungary) and Sergey Kiriyenko (Rosatom chairman) on 14 January 2014 Paks Nuclear Power Plant will be expanded by the Russian state company Rosatom. Eighty percent of the project's cost will be financed with a 10 billion Euro credit line from Russia. Subject to European Commission approval, construction of two VVER-1200 reactors is planned to start in 2019. On 6 March 2017, the European Commission announced its approval. János Süli, former CEO of the nuclear power station, was appointed Minister without Portfolio in the Third Orbán Government in May 2017, responsible for the planning, construction and commissioning of the two new blocks at Paks Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nOn 20 June 2019 the Paks II. Zrt. (Paks II. Ltd.) reported on their website that the preparation of the construction site has started including more than 80 service buildings.\n\nAn INES level 3 event (\"serious incident\") occurred on 10 April 2003 at the Unit 2 reactor. The incident occurred in the fuel rod cleaning system located under of water in a cleaning tank next to the spent fuel cooling pond, located adjacent to the reactor in the reactor hall. The reactor had been shut down for its annual refueling and maintenance period on 28 March and its fuel elements removed.\n\nThe cleaning system had been installed to remove dirt and corrosion from fuel elements and control rods during shutdown, as there had previously been problems with magnetite corrosion products from the steam generators being deposited on the fuel elements which affected the flow of coolant. The sixth set of thirty partially spent elements were in the tank having been cleaned, the cleaning having finished at 16:00. At 21:50, radiation alarms mounted on the cleaning system detected a sudden increase in the amount of krypton-85. The suspicion was that one of the fuel rod assemblies was leaking. At 22:30, the reactor hall was evacuated because of elevated radiation levels both there and in the ventilation stack.\n\nAt 02:15 the following morning, the hydraulic lock of the cleaning vessel lid was released, and immediately the dose rate increased significantly (6-12 millisieverts/hour) around the spent fuel pond and the pool containing the cleaning machine, and the water level dropped for a short time, by about . Water samples from the pond showed contamination due to damaged fuel rods. The lid on the cleaning machine was winched up at 04:20, but one of the three lifting cables attached to it broke; and it was not finally removed until 16 April.\n\nThe incident was initially given an INES rating of 2 (\"incident\"). However a video examination of the damaged fuel elements following the successful removal of the lid caused the rating to be raised to 3 (\"serious incident\"). This revealed that cladding on the majority of the 30 fuel elements had been broken, with radioactive spent uranium fuel pellets spilling from the elements into the bottom of the cleaning tank. Apart from the release of radioactive material, a concern was that the accumulation of a compact mass of fuel pellets could lead to a criticality accident, as the pellets were in a tank of neutron moderating water. Water containing neutron absorbing boric acid was added into the tank to raise its concentration to 16 g/kg to prevent this. Ammonia and hydrazine were also added to the water to help with the removal of radioactive iodine-131.\n\nAn investigation by the Hungarian Atomic Energy Agency concluded that the cause of the incident was inadequate cooling of the fuel elements, which were heated due to the radioactive decay of short-lived fission products. These were kept cool by water circulated by a submerged water pump. However the cooling was inadequate, leading to the damage to some elements through a build-up of steam around them, depriving them of most of their cooling. The investigation proposed that the severe damage probably occurred when the lid was released, causing thermal shock to cladding because of the sudden entry of cool water into the system, and explosive steam production.\n\nOne of the interesting results of the investigation was that the Hungarian Atomic Agency had placed too much trust in the technology and knowledge of the French Framatome Company (now Areva). The agency did not investigate documentation provided by the company deeply enough, missing a fatal design flaw in the Framatome-designed, produced, and operated cleaning equipment.\n\nThe discharge of radioactive gases through the stack continued for several days after the incident, although the Hungarian Atomic Energy Agency determined that the radiation levels adjacent to the plant were only about 10% above normal. However, the reactor remained out of service for over a year, finally resuming commercial electricity production in September 2004.\n\nThe damaged fuel was completely removed by the end of 2006 and in 2014 transported to Russia for final disposal.\n\nOn April 9, 2005, Unit 1 was shut down for planned maintenance. The defect that occurred during the cooling of the block was classified as INES grade 1 (abnormality), although the power plant originally requested a zero rating.\n\nA Self Powered Neutron Detector (SPND) was dropped when the wire rope holding it broke during an outage on 4 May 2009. The event was rated as INES 2. All staff were safely evacuated, and no member was exposed to more than the permitted daily radiation dose.\n\nOn September 6, 2012, a scheduled work was done on a gate, but the required written instructions were not completed in time. This is an administrative mismatch was classified as 1 in the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).\n\nMalfunctions (operational events) below the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) are published quarterly by the MVM Paks Nuclear Power Plant. According to IAEA, these mean no risk, yet a part of these resulted in partial or complete block shutdowns.\n\nOn the morning of 14 July 2016 reactor 1 was automatically shut down due to an equipment malfunction, which did not pose any safety threat. The reactor was brought back to full capacity the afternoon of the following day with the malfunction to be reviewed by the national regulator. The shut down came one week after a separate malfunction of a generator forced the plant to reduce its power output.\n\n\n"}

Russell, also known as Fort Francis E. Warren, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base and Fort David A. Russell, was a post and base of operations for the United States Army, and later the Air Force, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The fort had been established in 1867 to protect workers for the Union Pacific Railroad. It was named in honor of David Allen Russell, a Civil War general killed at the Battle of Opequon. In 1930, the fort's name was changed to Fort Francis E. Warren. In 1949, it became Francis E. Warren Air Force Base.\n\nOver the years, the base served as home for numerous influential American military leaders such as Carl Spaatz, Black Jack Pershing, Billy Mitchell, Walter Reed, and Mark Clark. A portion of the base was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1975, for distinctively preserving many of the stages of its evolution from a frontier cavalry base to an Air Force base.\n\nUnits of the 30th Infantry under Colonel John D. Stevenson began building the fort and nearby quartermaster depot (Cheyenne Depot) in August 1867. In September the first cavalry arrived, Company H of 2nd Cavalry In 1884, it became a permanent base. It was the home to three Black regiments: the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th Infantry (the famous Buffalo Soldiers) for much of the late 19th century.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Fort D. A. Russell was one of the largest cavalry bases in the United States and several more expansions in the early 20th century further increased its size.\n\nIn 1919, the airfield became active and soon served as the home field for over 100 military aircraft. The last cavalry units on the post were deactivated in 1927. In 1930, the base was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. Warren was a Medal of Honor recipient who served as Governor of Wyoming.\n\nDuring World War II, Fort Francis E. Warren served as a training facility for the US Army Quartermaster Corps. A prisoner of war camp was also constructed on the site.\n\nIn 1949, the base was redesignated the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base and became part of the Strategic Air Command in 1958. The base became the headquarters for the 90th Strategic Missile Wing in 1963. The wing controlled over 200 ICBMs during the Cold War. The base was the only missile wing to have Peacekeeper missiles which were deactivated in October 2005.\n\nOn October 1, 1993, the Twentieth Air Force, which controls all of America's ICBM wings, relocated its headquarters to Warren.\n\nThe fort was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 15, 1975, while still Francis E. Warren Air Force Base.\n\nThe majority of the structures in the historic district have been maintained. At least 88 housing units have been abated for lead and asbestos materials. Three buildings were renovated in accordance with standards of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. The Air Force was tasked to restore the two deck porches on many buildings in the district.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835742", "title": "Prince-Bishopric of Liège", "text": "Prince-Bishopric of Liège\n\nThe Prince-Bishopric of Liège or Principality of Liège was a state of the Holy Roman Empire in the Low Countries, situated for the most part in present Belgium, which was ruled by the Bishop of Liège. As a prince, the Bishop held an Imperial Estate and had seat and voice at the Imperial Diet. The Prince-Bishopric of Liège should not be confused with the Bishop's diocese of Liège, which was larger.\n\nThe bishops of Liège acquired their status as a Prince-bishop between 980 and 985 when Bishop Notger, who had been the bishop of Liege since 972, received secular control of the County of Huy from Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe Prince-Bishopric belonged from 1500 on to the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle. Its territory included most of the present Belgian provinces of Liège and Limburg, and some exclaves in other parts of Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIt briefly became a republic (the Republic of Liège) from 1789 to 1791, before reverting to a Prince-Bishopric in 1791. The role of the Bishop as prince permanently ended when the state was annexed by France in 1795. In 1815 the territories it had held became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and in 1830 they were within the part of that kingdom which split off to become Belgium.\n\nThe principality ruled by the bishops of Liège was never part of the Seventeen Provinces or the Spanish and Austrian Southern Netherlands, but from the 16th century onwards its politics were strongly influenced by the dukes of Burgundy and later the Habsburgs.\n\nIn 1559 its 1,636 parishes were grouped into eight archdeaconries, and twenty-eight councils, ' (deaneries). The most important cities (') of the bishopric were: Liège, Beringen, Bilzen, Borgloon, Bree, Châtelet, Ciney, Couvin, Dinant, Fosses-la-Ville, Hamont, Hasselt, Herk-de-Stad, Huy, Maaseik, Peer, Sint-Truiden, Stokkem, Thuin, Tongeren, Verviers, Visé and Waremme.\n\nThe city of Maastricht fell under the joint jurisdiction of the Prince-Bishop of Liège and the Duke of Brabant (later the States-General of the United Provinces). The second city of the prince-bishopric thus kept its ' throughout the '.\n\nThe large diocese of the medieval bishops was, until 1559, much larger than the princedom which was in their possession. However, the princely domain was gradually enlarged by donations and by acquisitions. In the 10th century, the bishops received secular power over the county of Huy, which lay within of the diocese. Bishop Notger (972–1008) thus became a sovereign prince. This status was retained by his successors until the French Revolution, and throughout that period of nearly eight centuries the Prince-Bishopric of Liège succeeded in maintaining a level of autonomy, though theoretically it was part of the Holy Roman Empire. This virtual independence was owed largely to the ability of its bishops, who on several occasions played an important part in international politics, being strategically positioned between France and Germany, .\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the prince-bishopric was further expanded with the lordship of Bouillon in 1096 (ceded to France in 1678), the acquisition of the county of Loon () in 1366 and the county of Horne in 1568.\n\nNotger, the founder of the principality, also rebuilt the cathedral of St Lambert, as well as the episcopal palace. He was also involved in other building activities in the city, which flourished under his rule (churches of St Paul, St. John the Evangelist, Sainte-Croix and St Denis). This bishop also strengthened the parochial organization of the city. He was one of the first church leaders to spread the observance of All Souls' Day, which he authorized for his diocese. Under Notger's administration, following up on the work of Heraclius, educational institutions in Liège flourished. With these two bishops (and Wazo) \"The schools of Liège were, in fact, at that time one of the brightest literary foci of the period\". In the 11th century the city was indeed known as the \"Athens of the North\". \"Liège for more than a century occupied among the nations a position in regard to science which it has never recovered\". Subsequent bishops, Balderic of Looz (1008–18), Wolbodo (1018–21), Durandus (1021–25), Reginard (1025–38), Nitard (1038–42), the learned Wazo, and Theoduin (1048–75), valiantly sustained the heritage of Notger. The schools formed many brilliant scholars, and gave the Catholic Church popes Stephen IX and Nicholas II. The diocese also supplied the University of Paris with a number of important doctors — William of Saint-Thierry, Gerard of Liège and Godfrey of Fontaines. Alger of Liège (1055–1131) was an important intellectual of the period. He was first appointed deacon of church of St Bartholomew and finally retired at the monastery of Cluny.\n\nIn the reign of Henry of Verdun (1075–91) a tribunal was instituted (\") to prevent war and enforce the Peace of God. Otbert (1091–1119) increased the territory of the principality by purchasing the Lordship of Bouillon. He remained faithful to emperor Henry IV, who died as his guest. Henry of Namur (1119–21) was venerated as a martyr. During the administration of Alexander of Juliers (1128–34) the pope, the emperor and St Bernard of Clairvaux visited Liège. The episcopate of Raoul of Zachringen was marked by the preaching of the reformer Lambert le Bègue, who is credited with founding the Béguines.\n\nAlbert of Louvain was elected Bishop of Liège in 1191, but Emperor Henry VI, on the pretext that the election was doubtful, gave the see to Lothair of Hochstadt. Albero's election was confirmed by the pope but in 1192, shortly after he took office, he was assassinated by three German knights at Reims. It is probable that the emperor was privy to this murder but Albero was canonized. In 1195, Albert de Cuyck (1195–1200) formally recognized the political franchise of the people of Liège. During the 12th century, the cathedral chapter, along with the bishop, assumed a more important role in the history of the principality.\n\nThe struggles between the upper and lower classes, in which the prince-bishops frequently intervened, developed through the 13th and 14th centuries, and culminate in the 15th century in the pillage and destruction of the episcopal city. In the reign of Robert of Thourotte (1240–46), Saint Juliana — a nun of Cornillon Abbey — was led by certain visions to the project of having a feast established in honour of the Blessed Sacrament. After much hesitation, the bishop approved of her idea but death prevented the institution of the feast. The completion of the work was left to a former prior of the Dominicans in Liège, Hugh of Saint-Cher, who returned to the city as papal legate. In 1252 Hugh made the feast of the Blessed Sacrament an obligation throughout his diocese. John of Troyes, who, after having been archdeacon at Liège, was elected pope as Urban IV, encouraged the observance of the feast of Corpus Christi in the whole Church. Another archdeacon of Liège became pope under the name Gregory X and deposed the unworthy Henry of Gueldres (1247–74). The Peace of Fexhe, signed in 1316 during the reign of Adolph II de la Marck (1313–44), regulated the relations between the prince-bishop and his subjects. Nevertheless, internal discord continued and the episcopate of Arnold of Horne (1378–89) was marked by the triumph of the popular party. In 1366, the county of Loon was annexed to the bishopric.\n\nUpon the death of Louis of Male, count of Flanders, in 1384, the Low Countries began their unification within the Burgundian Netherlands. Though the Principality was still nominally independent, the Dukes of Burgundy have had an increasing influence on its government. Louis of Bourbon (1456–82) was placed on the throne of Liège by the political machinations of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. The population resisted Burgundian rule leading to the Liège Wars, the destruction of Dinant in 1466, and of Liège in 1468 by Charles the Bold, marking the ending of democratic ascendancy in the Principality.\n\nCharles V completed the union of the Seventeen Provinces in the 1540s, and unofficially also controlled the principality. He nominated Erard de la Marck (1505–38) who brought a period of restoration. Erard was an enlightened protector of the arts. It was he who commenced the struggle against the Protestant reformers, which his successors carried forth, especially Gerard of Groesbeeck (1564–80). With the object of assisting in this struggle, Paul IV, by Bull (\", 12 May 1559), created new bishoprics in the Low Countries. The new bishoprics were created largely at the expense of the diocese of Liège; many of its parishes were given to the dioceses of Roermond, 's-Hertogenbosch, and Namur, or were added to the existing dioceses of Mechelen and Antwerp. The number of deaneries in the diocese of Liège was reduced to 13.\n\nLiège formed the last link in the chain of Habsburg allies that made up the so-called Spanish Road, a military corridor between Spanish-controlled Lombardy and the Spanish Netherlands. Completely encircled by Spanish territory, Liège was protected by treaties of neutrality which permitted the passage of Spanish troops through the prince-bishop's territory provided that they spent no more than two nights in one place. The importance of the prince-bishopric to Habsburg military logistics in the Eighty Years War prompted Spanish intervention foiling a Dutch invasion in 1595.\n\nMost of the bishops in the 17th century were foreigners, many of them holding several bishoprics at once. Their frequent absences gave free scope for those feuds of the Chiroux and the Grignoux to which Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (archbishop of Cologne, 1650–88) put a stop by the Edict of 1681. In the middle of the 18th century the ideas of the French encyclopedists began to be received at Liège; Bishop de Velbrück (1772–84), encouraged their propagation and thus prepared the way for the . Partially connected with the French Revolution, a protest against the absolutist rule of prince bishop Cesar Constantijn Frans van Hoensbroeck developed into the 1789 Revolution in Liège. At the beginning of 1791, the revolution was crushed by troops on the orders of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was dissolved in 1795, when it was annexed by France. Its territory was divided over the départements Meuse-Inférieure, Ourthe, and Sambre-et-Meuse.\n\n\n\n"}

The company, formerly ICO Global Communications, is based in Kirkland, Washington.\n\nIn June, 2011, Pendrell acquired the Ovidian Group, a leading worldwide intellectual property strategic advisory services firm. In October, 2011, Pendrell acquired ContentGuard, a leading developer of digital rights management technologies with more than 260 patents. More than 50 percent of the world's handset manufacturers have licensing agreements in place with ContentGuard.\n\nFounded in January 1995, ICO Global Communications, planned to build a mobile-satellite service (MSS) constellation in medium Earth orbit (in two 45°-inclined orthogonal planes), and had contracted Boeing Satellite Development Center (then Hughes) for 12 spacecraft in July of that year — ten operational spacecraft and two in-orbit spares. ICO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1999, but emerged as New ICO in May 2000, following investments by Craig McCaw and others. ICO has pursued plans to build and launch a geosynchronous satellite to cover North America, supplemented by an ancillary terrestrial component. ICO G1 launched on April 14, 2008, and ICO's application for an ancillary terrestrial component was approved by the Federal Communications Commission in January 2009.\n\nIn June 2011 ICO Global Communications was renamed to Pendrell Corporation ().\n\nThe first spacecraft, a Hughes HS 601 designated ICO F-1, was lost due to a Sea Launch anomaly on March 12, 2000. In September 2000, ICO contracted Hughes for three additional spacecraft, and Hughes agreed to modify the 11 remaining spacecraft from the original contract to support an ICO re-design of the system. Hughes Space Systems subsequently became a subsidiary of the Boeing Corporation. On June 19, 2001, the second spacecraft, ICO F2, was successfully launched by an Atlas II AS from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The remaining spacecraft are in storage in various stages of near completion, and litigation between ICO and Boeing involving the ICO MEO satellites went to trial in June, 2008. In October, 2008, a jury awarded ICO $371 million in damages and $236 million in punitive damages in verdicts which found Boeing guilty of fraud, tortious interference and breach of contract. The Los Angeles County Superior Court finalized the verdict in March, 2009 in an amount totaling $603 million.\n\nThe ICO G1 satellite was built by Space Systems/Loral, based on the Loral 1300 platform. A contract to launch the satellite was signed with Lockheed Martin, who announced plans to launch the satellite on an Atlas V launch vehicle, flying in the 421 configuration. Launch, from Space Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station occurred at 20:12:00 GMT on April 4, 2008. The satellite separated from the carrier rocket 30 minutes and 49 seconds later, completing a successful launch. It is currently in a nominal geosynchronous orbit.

Dratch's character would usually appear at social gatherings and interrupt the conversation to voice negative opinions and pronouncements. She is especially concerned about the rate of feline AIDS, a subject that she would bring up on more than one occasion, saying it was the number one killer of domestic cats.\n\nThe first appearance of Debbie Downer was on May 1, 2004, with guest host Lindsay Lohan. Debbie and five family members—played by Lohan, Jimmy Fallon, Dratch, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, and Horatio Sanz—are eating breakfast at a restaurant in Walt Disney World. While the family makes small talk, Debbie makes negative comments on current events followed by a knowing look at the camera and a cartoonish \"wah-wah\" sound made by a muted trombone.\n\nIn this sketch, everyone on camera cracked up because of both the \"wah-wah\" sound effect and Dratch flubbing a line early on and correcting herself. The sketch was listed at number 99 as part of TV Land's \"Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History.\"\n\nDebbie Downer appeared in a sketch in the 2004–05 season opener with Ben Affleck as the guest host. The cast members who appeared in this sketch were more composed and did not laugh out loud at Debbie's pronouncements. This trend continued throughout the rest of the season.\n\nIn future airings of the Affleck episode, the live Debbie Downer sketch was replaced by the dress rehearsal version, along with an opening title card explaining that the dress rehearsal \"worked better.\" In the dress rehearsal, the cast all cracks up just as they did in the Lindsay Lohan episode.\n\nThe character appeared two more times that season: once at Thanksgiving dinner (with Luke Wilson as host) and another at the Oscars with Hilary Swank (playing herself). The latter sketch revealed that Debbie babysat Swank when Swank was a child. Will Forte appeared in the sketch as Swank's then-husband, Chad Lowe.\n\nIn 2005, the season premiere of \"Saturday Night Live\" featured a Debbie Downer sketch at the end of the episode. Host Steve Carell's character, Bob Bummer, is just as negative, and he and Debbie fall in love.\n\nThe December 17, 2005, episode, hosted by Jack Black, included a Christmas-themed sketch showing Debbie in her childhood during a visit from Santa Claus. This episode contradicts her debut sketch, as here she refers to her last name being \"Downer.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2006, Debbie returned for her final appearance before Dratch departed the show, this time at a bachelorette party at a strip club in Las Vegas for her sister, played once again by host Lohan, despite not being invited in the first place. As with the very first sketch, there is one point when the orchestra mistakenly began playing the \"wah-wah\" sound effect at the wrong time.\n\nDuring the May 8, 2010, episode hosted by Betty White, there was a Debbie Downer sketch filmed during dress rehearsal, but it was cut from the live show due to time constraints. The episode is now posted on NBC.com's \"Saturday Night Live\" page, featuring video clips of old and new sketches from the show's 35-years-and-counting tenure. A group of suburban women (all played by the guest actresses listed in addition to then-current cast member Kristen Wiig) are having a lingerie party and, as usual, Debbie Downer ruins everyone's fun. One housewife (played by Amy Poehler) yells at Debbie and asks her why she's so miserable all the time. Downer thinks back to her childhood where during her birthday, her depressed grandmother (played by White) warns her not to enjoy her birthday cake because gluten allergies run in her family.\n\nDuring the SNL 40th anniversary special, Dratch appears briefly at the beginning as Downer, telling the audience that starting a show with a musical performance decreases viewership.\n\nDebbie appears in the March 7, 2020 episode hosted by Daniel Craig, where she is a guest at a wedding, bringing her melancholy with her. She complained about the coronavirus and, once again, feline AIDS.\n\nEvery sketch opened with a prologue, then the theme song (and corresponding video) plays, followed by the body of the sketch. The sketch would ultimately close with the last line of the song played again (and one more negative fact from Debbie). The song ends with an extreme close-up of Debbie's pained expression.\n\nTheme song lyrics:\n\"You're enjoying your day, \neverything's going your way,\nthen along comes Debbie Downer.\nAlways there to tell you 'bout a new disease,\na car accident, \nor killer bees.\nYou'll beg her to spare you,\n'Debbie, please!'\nbut you can't stop Debbie Downer!\"\n\nThe Christmas sketch began with a special theme song. It featured an animated Debbie, looking much like \"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas\", and a tune similar to \"You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\". Steve Carell's Bob Bummer also had his own theme song.\n\n\n"}

Following this fight Grigsby tested positive for illegal drugs and the title was declared vacant. Following this fight the title was won by Masibulele Makepula but was stripped again. He won the vacant title on April 14, 2001, in a fight against Andy Tabanas. Dieppa defended the title successfully five times before losing it to Hugo Cázares on April 30, 2005.\n\nNelson Dieppa was born and raised in Vieques, Puerto Rico. He began his boxing career at a young age. As an amateur Dieppa represented Puerto Rico in international competitions, competing in the Light Flyweight division\n(– 48 kilograms). In 1991 he represented the island in two major international events. The first one was the World Amateur Boxing Championships, organized in Sydney, Australia from November 15 to 23. In this event he won bronze, finishing in the third global position along Daniel Petrov of Bulgaria. His second international participation of the year was in the Pan American Games that took place on Havana, Cuba. Here he again took bronze, sharing the third position with Fernando Retayud of Colombia. A year later he went on to represent Puerto Rico at the 1992 Olympic Games, held in Barcelona, Spain. These would mark his final participation in an amateur event. Dieppa only participated in one fight in the first round of the Olympic boxing tournament, where he fought against Daniel Petrov. Dieppa lost the fight by points, with a final score of 7-10.\n\nDieppa debuted as a professional on February 13, 1993, when he fought Carlos Figueroa in an event organized at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. He won the fight by knockout in the first round. His first professional fight in Vieques took place on March 7, 1993, when he knocked out David Almodouvar in the second round. It took Dieppa almost eight months to return to a boxing ring in an official fight. This was his first major lay-off from boxing. He returned, on January 29, 1994, and participated in a boxing card that took place in San Juan, where he defeated Jose Hernandez by unanimous decision. Dieppa's first fight outside of Puerto Rico took place on April 13, 1995, when he fought Hipolito Saucedo, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The contest was scheduled for six rounds and the judges declared it a draw. Following this fight he participated in four fights organized in Ponce and San Juan, winning two by knockout.\n\nOn June 1, 1996, Dieppa won his first regional professional championship when he defeated Pablo Tiznado in a card that took place in Miami, Florida. In this fight he won the Fecarbox Flyweight championship, a regional title sanctioned by the World Boxing Council. During this timeframe Dieppa was trained by Félix Trinidad Sr. and was under contract with Don King. Dieppa won three, non-title bouts in a row, including a unanimous decision in eight rounds against Kenny Berrios on June 7, 1997. His next fight was against Carlos Murillo and was held on February 13, 1998, at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The judges awarded Murillo a split decision victory, marking Dieppa's first professional defeat. On October 3, 1998, he returned to activity in a fight against Orlando Malone. Dieppa won the fight by unanimous decision. He participated in three fights between 1999 and early 2000, winning all of them by knockout.\n\nOn July 3, 2000, Dieppa had his first world title opportunity. Dieppa fought world champion Will Grigsby for the WBO's world Jr. Flyweight title. Dieppa was declared the winner by unanimous decision at first, but Grigsby tested positive for cocaine after the fight. The WBO declared the fight a no contest and Dieppa was stripped of the championship. Masibulele Makepula of South Africa won the vacant championship but the WBO stripped it and declared it vacant.\n\nAfter winning a preparatory fight, Dieppa would fight against Andy Tabanas for the vacant WBO championship. The fight was organized at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. Dieppa won the fight by knockout in the eleventh round. His first title defense took place on September 29, 2001, where he retained his title with a twelve-round unanimous decision over Fahran Sakkreehrin. The end of the fight with Sakkreehin marked the beginning of Dieppa's managerial problems. During this timeframe Félix Trinidad Sr. retired, leaving Dieppa without a trainer. As a consequence Dieppa spent several months inactive. His next fight took place on August 24, 2002, against John Molina. Defending his WBO Jr. Flyweight title for the second time, Dieppa suffered an injury product of accidental headbutt in the second round, which led to the fight being declared a technical draw.\n\nFor the next year and a half, Dieppa had a series of problems, including some injuries and ongoing managerial disputes. The World Boxing Organization considered stripping him of the championship, but decided that Dieppa was unable to defend the title due to matters outside of his control. On March 20, 2004, Dieppa participated in his third title defense, against Colombia's Kermin Guardia in a fight held at the Mario Morales coliseum, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Dieppa won by knockout after one minute and fifty-one seconds of the round had passed. Guardia announced his retirement immediately after the fight. Dieppa's next defense took place on July 30, 2004, in a card organized in Louisville, Kentucky, where he fought against Ulises Solís. Dieppa retained the title by a majority decision, with one of the judges scoring the fight 114-114 while the other two gave scorecards of 120-108 in favor of Dieppa.\n\nOn January 29, 2005, Dieppa fought against Alex Sánchez in a fight that took place at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum, in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Prior to the fight a number of promotional events were organized. Sanchez had an early advantage in the fight, relying on his boxing skills. In the eleventh round Dieppa won by knockout after connecting a solid combination. This fight was named the fight of the year in Puerto Rico by the local boxing commission.\n\nOn April 30, 2005, Dieppa lost the light flyweight championship against Hugo Cázares. The fight was stopped in the tenth round with Cazares receiving a technical decision victory.\n\nOn December 17, 2005, Dieppa returned to action versus Juan Alfonso Keb Baas in an event organized in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Dieppa won by unanimous decision and won the vacant WBC Continental Americas Jr. Flyweight title. On May 26, 2006, Dieppa fough against Eric Ramírez of Mexico. In this fight he focused on using his boxing skills to counter Ramírez's aggressive style. Dieppa received identical scores of 97-92 from the judges. On March 23, 2007, Dieppa lost by divided decision against Daniel Reyes. Following this fight, Dieppa defeated former champion Alex Sanchez, and lost by unanimous decision to Iván Calderón for the WBO's championship.\n\n"}

Blunt (April 24, 1908, in Andover, Massachusetts – January 7, 2004, in Durham, North Carolina) was an American high school and collegiate track and basketball coach. \n\nBlunt's mother moved to Massachusetts from Virginia to work as a domestic. His family lived in Massachusetts' Merrimack Valley during a time when the Black population was tiny, but he recalled the large annual church picnic outing that families from neighboring Lynn, Lowell, and Haverhill would attend each summer in Salem, Massachusetts. He attended the old Punchard High School. As a young man and collegian, Russell earned money by waiting tables in the dining hall at the famed Andover Prep school (Phillips Academy). He also played semipro baseball for the St. Clair Oil Company team, the Andover Giants, and a team called Tyer Rubber, usually as a catcher. With a baseball team called the Fairviews out of Seabrook, N.H., Blunt earned $5 and $7 a game as a catcher. Some of his teammates in those days had surnames later heavily associated with Massachusetts baseball, such as \"Gagne\" and \"Bedrosian\".\n\nIn 1927, Blunt left his home town in Massachusetts to attend St. Paul's Normal and Industrial in Lawrenceville, Virginia. When the train reached the Mason–Dixon line, he had to switch cars because of segregation. Blunt graduated from St. Augustine's College in 1936, where he began his coaching career. Blunt coached every year until his retirement, except in 1944, when he earned his master's degree from Boston University. In addition to becoming an assistant football coach at St. Paul's in 1946, Blunt also worked as a basketball official. \n\nHe started coaching at Hillside High in Durham, North Carolina in 1955. His teams won 10 state outdoor track championships, seven indoor track championships and had one stretch where they didn't lose a dual meet for thirteen years. \n\nHe also coached high school basketball at Hillside- his best known players were future college All-Americans and NBA players John Lucas, and Rodney Rogers. In the 1990s, USA Today published an article that stated Coach Blunt was the oldest h.s. basketball coach in America.\n\nDr. Blunt was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame in 1995 and the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.

{"id": "1835791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835791", "title": "Forza Motorsport", "text": "Forza Motorsport\n\nForza Motorsport is a 2005 simulation racing video game developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox gaming system. The word \"Forza\" is Italian for strength. The game is the first installment in the \"Forza\" series, a series that has continued on Microsoft's subsequent consoles, the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. It features over 200 cars and multiple real world and fictional race courses. It also featured online multiplayer via Xbox Live. \"Forza Motorsport\" received universal acclaim according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, and received a Gold sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The NPD Group reported that in its release month the game sold over 100,000 copies in North America.\n\n\"Forza Motorsport\" is a simulation racing video game. Players compete in events around the globe using real licensed cars on a variety of real world and fictional courses. It features an arcade mode, meant more for quickplay of races, and a career mode, which is focused on long-term play. Career mode spans several racing disciplines, spanning from racing of common commuter cars to those in racing series such as Super GT and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters as well as other sports car racing series. To help players acclimate to the simulation style of racing, assists such as an ideal racing line, anti-lock brakes and traction control can be used. There are 231 cars in \"Forza Motorsport\" ranging from a Honda Civic to supercars such as the Enzo Ferrari and Le Mans race prototypes such as the Audi R8. There are nine classes of cars, spanning standard production vehicles to sports and high performance cars to purpose-built race cars. Each car can be upgraded and tuned with a large number of extras and parts.\n\nVehicles can be customized by the player, both visually and performance-wise. In addition to adding body parts such as hood scoops and body kits, players can add multiple layers of decals to the vehicles. Upgrades are separated into three categories: engine/power, appearance/aerodynamics and chassis/drivetrain. There is a wide range of tuning available including tire pressure, which changes during races due to temperature, downforce, gear ratios and limited slip differential. Vehicles can be realistically damaged, from both a cosmetic and a performance standpoint. This changes the way the game is played, as collisions with barriers and other cars will alter the car's handling, top speed and acceleration. More noticeably, spoilers can be knocked off cars, bumpers dangle from their supports, paint can be scraped off and windows can be smashed completely.\n\nThe game contains a mix of licensed, street, point to point and original circuits. Real world tracks Road Atlanta, Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Tsukuba, Road America, and Nürburgring Nordschleife were licensed and included. Furthermore, the game's Blue Mountains Raceway circuit is heavily comparable in track layout, characteristics and backgrounds with the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst. In addition to these, \"Forza Motorsport\" also contains a wide variety of autocross, oval, and dragstrip courses. Each of these could be played online through the original Xbox Live service or through System Link, which allows multiple Xbox consoles to be interconnected through a local area network. Network multiplayer is no longer available via Xbox Live, which was discontinued by Microsoft on April 15, 2010. The game is backwards compatible, and can be played on the Xbox 360, though as it uses the original Xbox Live service there is no online play.\n\n\"Forza Motorsport\" was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004. Development of the game took over two and a half years. The release was delayed at three times, with GameSpot reporting the first delay from a December 2004 release to February 2005. It would later be delayed until April 2005. It was delayed one last time, and the game was released May 3, 2005 in North America and May 13, 2005 in Europe. To promote \"Forza\" and other Xbox Live titles Microsoft teamed up with EB Games to provide 25 kiosks with games that could be played online through the service. \"Forza\" was the first of these titles to be displayed and playable on the kiosks. It was shown at multiple events during its development. Following E3 2004, it was shown at GameRiot, a traveling game event. It further was featured at the 2004 Tokyo Game Show.\n\nIt was developed to allow for multiple Xbox consoles to be linked directly and/or to be played online via Xbox Live. A customization system was developed where players can create custom layers over sections of the car, similar to layers in professional image programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Objects can be change in shape, scale and color, which allowed for players to create custom designs and liveries. Each car is divided into six sections, and each section can handle up to 100 layers. A custom soundtrack was composed by DJ Junkie XL, which features 56 original music tracks.\n\nThe game began with a team of only 20 people and was, according to Turn 10 studio head Dan Greenawalt, originally an excellent simulator, but not as fun as a game. He stated that the team then worked \"to make the physics more accessible, more handle-able. So we started on the game.\" Greenawalt further noted that he wanted it to be a \"car collecting game.\" To aid with that Turn 10 hired a designer formerly of Nintendo's \"Pokémon\" team and said that the team \"played a lot of Animal Crossing and Diablo II.\" It was developed to display in high definition at 480p, and supports Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The team developed drivitar technology, which is an artificial intelligence avatar for the player which learns from the players habits. The player can assign the drivitar to compete in races which they do not wish to, such as endurance races.\n\nLike the majority of major racing simulators, \"Forza Motorsport\" is designed to calculate a car's performance in real time using physical data (for example, the weight of a car's engine, its drag coefficient, etc.), consequently causing the cars to mimic the handling characteristics of their real-life counterparts. In 2005, Popular Science magazine tested this effect by inviting professional race car driver Gunnar Jeannette and a car enthusiast without major professional motorsports experience to drive identical cars on an identical track in both \"Forza Motorsport\" and the real world. Aside from several cars which were either in challenging physical condition or lacking identical setups, Jeannette's track times matched closely from his performance on the real track and in virtual reality. The amateur's real world times in all of the cars were roughly identical despite a 16-second spread between fastest and slowest in Forza, which he attributed to his fear of the consequences of driving too hard causing him to drive more slowly in the faster cars.\n\n\"Forza Motorsport\" received a Gold sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The NPD Group reported that in its release month the game sold over 100,000 copies in North America.\n\n\"Forza Motorsport\" received universal acclaim according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was also featured in the June 2004 issue of \"Popular Science\". Reviewers praised the game's advantages over \"Gran Turismo 4\". Che Chou of \"1UP.com\" commented that \"Forza\" was the \"most realistic console racer ever made\". GameSpot's Brian Ekberg noted how well the game balanced accessibility and pleasing genre fans. Kristan Reed of \"Eurogamer\" liked the game's online integration. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one nine for a total of 31 out of 40.\n\n\"Maxim\" gave the game all five stars, saying, \"Microsoft Game Studios' answer to Sony's automotive masterpiece is simple–add online play and program cars that take realistic damage.\" \"The Times\" also gave it all five stars, saying that \"the really ingenious element is the Drivatar AI, in which the computer learns your driving technique.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \"Car handling is demanding, but beginners can instantly have fun, thanks to helpful driving assists and generous early prizes.\" However, Jim Schaefer of \"Detroit Free Press\" gave it three stars out of four, saying, \"man, is this game difficult, even on the easy setting. I prefer games with unreal speed, power boosts and shortcuts. I just couldn't seem to get a grip on Forza until I played around with different cars, perusing the six classes, from standard production cars like your basic Honda Civic to race cars like the Audi R8.\"\n\n"}

The show is based on the 1957 movie of the same name, which in turn was based on the 1955 novelette of the same name by Ernest Lehman. The show tells the story of a powerful newspaper columnist named J. J. Hunsecker (based on famed New York columnist Walter Winchell) who uses his connections to ruin his sister's relationship with a man he deems inappropriate.\n\nIt was a critical and commercial failure.\n\nA workshop was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in August 1998. According to a Livent spokesman \"the show had a cast of 18, made up mainly of Canadians. The performers' names were not revealed.\" The workshop was directed by Nicholas Hytner. The workshop was followed by a reading in November 1998 in New York City, with Jonathan Pryce as J.J. Hunsecker, Brian d'Arcy James as Sidney, Anastasia Barzee, Patrick Wilson, Stacey Logan and an ensemble of 12.\n\nIt had a pre-Broadway tryout in Chicago, Illinois, in January 2002. Critics' reactions were not favorable. Chicago Tribune critic Chris Jones found that it had an \"identity crisis\" and warned that \"...[b]etween now and the Broadway opening, director Nicholas Hytner and the other multitalented parties involved had better all get on the same conceptual page, or what’s left of the gossip column fraternity will have a lot to chew on.\"\n\nSubsequently changes were made to the show, including a new ending.\n\nModifications to the plot and differences from the film reportedly reflect author Ernest Lehman's original intent. Lehman was the author of the original novelette and a producer on the musical adaptation.\n\nThe musical opened on March 14, 2002 at the Martin Beck Theatre on Broadway. Again directed by Hytner, it closed on June 15, 2002, after 109 performances and 18 previews. The show starred John Lithgow as J.J. Hunsecker, and Brian d'Arcy James as Sidney Falcone.\n\nThe creative team included choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, sets and costumes by Bob Crowley, and lighting by Natasha Katz. \"Sweet Smell\" garnered 7 Tony Award nominations including Best Musical. John Lithgow received the show's only Tony Award, winning Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical.\n\n\nGood Evening Mr. and Mrs. America. It's New York, 1952. Welcome to Broadway, the glamour capital of the universe. JJ Hunsecker (John Lithgow) rules it all with his daily gossip column in the New York Globe, syndicated to sixty million readers across America. JJ has the goods on everyone, from the President to the latest starlet. And everyone feeds JJ scandal, from J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Joe McCarthy down to a battalion of hungry press agents who attach their news to a client that JJ might plug. You’re no one if you’re not in JJ. You can become no one if JJ turns on you (\"The Column\").\n\nMeet Sidney Falcone (Brian D'Arcy James), a struggling press agent whose sole client is a nowhere jazz dive, the Club Voodoo. Tony, the owner, gives Sidney an ultimatum. No item in JJ, no job. Tonight, the only customer at the Voodoo is Susan (Kelli O'Hara), a classy beauty, who's there to see Dallas (John E. Noseworthy, Jr) the hot young piano player. It's his last night before going off to play a gig in Chicago. He wants Susan to go with him. She can’t. There's someone who wouldn’t like it.\n\nLooking for a client - any client - Sidney offers his services to Dallas (\"I Can Get You In JJ\") Dallas laughs off Sidney's pitch. He will make it on his own. Sidney then turns to Susan and promises that, if she hires him, he’ll make her a star with one mention in JJ. She doesn’t bite. Sidney's taken with her but when he sees Dallas sing to Susan, he realizes he hasn’t a chance (\"I Cannot Hear the City\").\n\nSuddenly JJ shows up at the Voodoo, knowing nothing of Dallas. He's followed Susan, furious that she walked out on him earlier at dinner at the Stork Club. Why is she in a dive like this? As Dallas moves to JJ to tell him why, Susan distracts JJ by introducing Sidney as the reason. She claims Sidney is her partner in acting class. Sidney is stunned. (He’d assumed Susan was JJ's girlfriend but finds out she's JJ's sister). Sidney goes along with the ruse. As JJ questions Sidney on his nightly crawl of every hotspot in Manhattan (\"Welcome to the Night\").\n\nJJ buys Sidney a new suit, and gets Sidney's waitress girlfriend, Rita (Stacey Logan), a job at a fancy nightspot called the Cafe Elysian. JJ introduces Sidney to the powerful and sinister Police Detective Kello. JJ gets Sidney clients, and urges his new friend to “keep the ‘O’ and change his name to Falco.” Life’s great! (\"Laughing All The Way To The Bank\"). Sidney can’t believe his new friendship. The life he's dreamed of is here. (\"At The Fountain\").\n\nWeeks later, before dawn, at St. Patrick's Cathedral, in the presence of the Almighty, it's payback time. JJ makes Sidney (the former altar-boy) swear he will follow Susan and report on all that he sees.\n\nSusan and Dallas are in bed (\"Don't Know Where You Leave Off\") Susan's agonized. She can’t tell JJ about their romance. JJ would never accept her loving a nobody like Dallas. Dallas gives her an ultimatum. He's back from his latest gig in Philadelphia in three weeks. Tell JJ by then. Dallas says goodbye to Susan at Penn Station with an epic kiss, seen by Sidney. When Susan sees him, Sidney admits he's following her on JJ's behalf. He advises her to drop this nobody Dallas. Susan reminds Sidney how much she helped a nobody like him. In return, she asks Sidney to take on Dallas as a secret client and make him a somebody (\"What If\").\n\nSusan takes Sidney home to JJ's penthouse. JJ regales Sidney with stories about Susie's childhood, their life together and how much everyone loves his little sister (\"For Susan\"). Sidney, seeing how oppressive JJ's love is to Susan, feeds JJ an item about a great young piano player named Dallas Cochran who needs a break. JJ will print it. Susan is silently grateful. When Sidney leaves, JJ asks Susan to dance like they used to when she was a little girl. When she rejects him, JJ suspects Susan of seeing someone and counts on Sidney to tell him who that someone is.\n\nThanks to JJ's rave, Dallas is in New York headlining at the hip Cafe Elysian (\"One Track Mind\"). JJ proudly introduces Susan to his discovery, Dallas. Then he sees Susan's loving reaction. Sidney tries to hustle JJ out of the club. Tony from the Voodoo has stopped by to see Dallas’ success, Tony unwittingly drops the bombshell that Susan and Dallas have been an item for a while. JJ is incensed at having been duped by Sidney. Nobody lies to JJ. Sidney is trapped.\n\nAs Act II opens, Sidney vows to JJ he’ll clear up this Susan/Dallas thing. Clear it up? JJ insists that he \"Break It Up\". Or else. And Susan must never know JJ's behind it.\n\nSidney tries every ploy he can think of to end the romance. Nothing works. Sidney's downfall is swift. He's blackballed from the column and loses all his clients. JJ, while pretending to be happy for Susan and Dallas, gives Sidney a deadline to demolish their relationship. By morning.\n\nIn desperation to get back into JJ's favor, Sidney tries to plant a vicious smear about Dallas in the column of a rival gossip monger, Otis Elwell. However, the repulsive Otis will only print the item for a price. Sidney realizes he has “the price” at home, where Sidney's girlfriend Rita is eagerly waiting for him (\"Rita's Tune\"). Sidney shows up with Elwell. His purpose is clear. Rita's revolted that Sidney would use her like this. Sidney needs Otis's column. He's desperate. He bullies and manipulates Rita into going along with his scheme. After Otis phones in Sidney's smear, Sidney leaves them together.\n\nThe public descends on the morning edition. They revel in how the item will ruin Dallas (\"Dirt\").\n\nJJ is hosting a charity telethon. Susan comes backstage to show JJ the lie of a smear in a rival paper, and begs JJ for help. Sidney assures Susan that JJ will. Bring Dallas in. JJ is enraged. Sidney advises JJ to do what Susan wants, get Dallas his job back, then leave Dallas alone with him for five minutes. He will wind Dallas so tight that Dallas will snap, and the relationship with Susan will be over. JJ admires his protege. “You’re a cookie full of arsenic” JJ calls the Elysian and gets Dallas reinstated, then goes on with his telethon. Sidney then reveals to Dallas how he got his career-making gig (\"I Could Get You In JJ\" (reprise)). JJ returns in time to hear Dallas’ angry disbelief at Susan's deception. Dallas insults JJ and his column. Susan tells Dallas to leave. Sidney is triumphant. JJ tells Susan he's taking her to England for the coronation, immediately after the telethon. She agrees to go, then runs after Dallas. She tries to explain that he’ll never escape JJ's power. He won’t be safe (\"I Can Hear the City\" (reprise)).\n\nJJ can’t forget Dallas’ insults. Not satisfied that Susan and Dallas have parted, JJ wants Sidney to “take Dallas apart”. Sidney doesn’t do stuff like that. Then JJ suggests Sidney call Lt. Kello to do it. Never. What if JJ gave Sidney his column, what then? JJ gives him Kello's number. While JJ performs his old vaudeville routine on the telethon (\"Don't Look Now\"), Sidney calls Kello and sets up Dallas to be brutally and lethally beaten.\n\nSidney informs JJ the deed is done. JJ announces to America that, while he's away in England, Sidney will write the column. Sidney's at the pinnacle (\"At The Fountain\" (reprise)).\n\nSusan interrupts his victory. She tells him Dallas has been found. Sidney won’t let her miss that boat. JJ waits impatiently at the dock. Susan refuses to get on board. She produces Rita as a witness who saw Sidney plant drugs on Dallas and signal Kello for the attack. JJ feigns shock that Sidney would do such a thing. Otis Elwell appears. Susan has called him with a story. Sidney and JJ are terrified. The story is that she and Dallas are going to marry and leave New York. Yes, Dallas is alive. Otis goes, grateful for the scoop. Susan tells JJ that he’ll never see her again.

It asserts that judges should hesitate to strike down laws unless they are obviously unconstitutional, though what counts as obviously unconstitutional is itself a matter of some debate. Judicial restraint is sometimes regarded as the opposite of judicial activism. In deciding questions of constitutional law, judicially restrained jurists go to great lengths to defer to the legislature. Judicially restrained judges respect stare decisis, the principle of upholding established precedent handed down by past judges.\n\nLiberal restraint was shown in Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt in which the 1973 decision of Roe v Wade was upheld in favour of a woman's right to abortion. Cases on abortion have been heard since then, and while some have placed limitations on it, or allowed individual states to decide on those limitations, the unwillingness of the Court to overturn this decision remains. \n\nConservative restraint was shown in Glossip v Gross in which support was built in favour of the continued use of lethal injection. The case suggested that prisoners could only challenge the method of execution by providing an alternative method of execution. The Court argued that it was the responsibility of the prisoner to demonstrate that the execution method caused severe pain, not the responsibility of the state.\nFormer Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., considered to be one of the first major advocates of the philosophy, would describe the importance of judicial restraint in many of his books. One noted academic described Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, a Democrat appointed by Franklin Roosevelt, as the \"model of judicial restraint\".\n\nWhen the conservative Rehnquist Court overturned some of the precedents of the more liberal Warren Court, \"Time\" magazine said he was not following the theory of judicial restraint. However, Rehnquist was also acknowledged as a more conservative advocate of the philosophy.\n\nJudicial minimalists argue that judges should put great emphasis on adherence to \"stare decisis\" and precedent. Minimalists argue that judges should make only minor, incremental changes to constitutional law to maintain that stability. They ask judges to do this by creating small, case-specific rulings rather than broad, sweeping rulings.\n\nThe political question doctrine encourages courts to decline to rule in certain categories of politically controversial cases. Under this theory, a court acknowledges that the Constitution might have been violated but declines to act. It is often described as a type of judicial restraint, although it can be considered a form of judicial activism against plaintiffs whose rights have been violated and find their cases dismissed.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835849", "title": "Caterina Sforza", "text": "Caterina Sforza\n\nCaterina Sforza (1463 – 28 May 1509) was an Italian noblewoman, the Countess of Forlì and Lady of Imola, firstly with her husband Girolamo Riario, and after his death as a regent of her son Ottaviano.\n\nCaterina was the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan and Lucrezia, the wife of the courtier Gian Piero Landriani, a close friend of the Duke. She was raised in the refined Milanese court. The descendant of a dynasty of noted condottieri, from an early age, Caterina distinguished herself through her bold and impetuous actions taken to safeguard her possessions from possible usurpers and to defend her dominions from attack, when they were involved in political intrigues.\n\nIn her private life Caterina was devoted to various activities, including experiments in alchemy and a love of hunting and dancing. She had many children, but only the youngest, Captain Giovanni delle Bande Nere, inherited his mother's forceful, militant personality. Caterina's resistance to Cesare Borgia meant she had to face his fury and imprisonment. Once she gained her freedom in Rome, she led a quiet life in Florence. In the final years of her life, she confided to a monk: \"Se io potessi scrivere tutto, farei stupire il mondo\" (\"If I could write everything that happened, I would shock the world\").\n\nCaterina Sforza was born in Milan in early 1463, the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza by his mistress, Lucrezia Landriani. It's believed that she spent the first years of her life with her mother's relatives. The bond between mother and daughter was never interrupted: in fact, Lucrezia followed Caterina's growth and was always close to her in the crucial moments of her life, even in the final years that she spent in Florence.\n\nUpon the succession of Galeazzo Maria Sforza as Duke of Milan in 1466, following the death of his father Francesco, Galeazzo arranged for his four children by Lucrezia Landriani to come to court: Carlo (born in 1461; later Count of Magenta), Caterina, Alessandro (born in 1465; later Lord of Francavilla) and Chiara (born in 1467; by her first marriage, she became Countess dal Verme di Sanguinetto and Lady of Vigevano; by her second marriage, she became Lady of Novi). The children were entrusted to their paternal grandmother, Bianca Maria Visconti. In 1466 Galeazzo had married Dorotea Gonzaga, but after her death he remarried to Bona of Savoy on 9 May 1468, who eventually adopted them all.\n\nAt the Sforza court, frequented by writers and artists, Caterina and her siblings received a humanistic education. At that time, in the Italian courts, daughters of noble families received the same education as their brothers. In addition to Latin and the reading of the classics, as prescribed by her teachers, Caterina learned, especially from her paternal grandmother, to take pride in her warlike ancestors, to show boldness in the use of arms and astuteness in the skill of government. From her adoptive mother, she received her share of the maternal warmth and affection that Bona of Savoy poured over all of the children of her husband; this continued – after Caterina had left the Milanese court – in the form of correspondence between the two women.\n\nThe duke's family resided in Milan and in Pavia, and often stayed at Galliate or at Cusago, where Galeazzo Maria devoted himself to hunting. At one or the other of the two places Caterina also probably acquired her lifelong passion for hunting.\n\nIn 1473 Caterina became betrothed to Girolamo Riario, the son of Paolo Riario and Bianca della Rovere, sister of Pope Sixtus IV (in office: 1471–1484). Caterina replaced her cousin, the 11-year-old Costanza Fogliani, as Girolamo's bride because, according to some historians, Costanza's mother Gabriella Gonzaga (illegitimate daughter of Marquis Ludovico III of Mantua) refused to allow the consummation of the marriage until Costanza reached the legal age—then 14—while Caterina, although only ten years old at that time, agreed with the demands of the groom; other sources instead reported that the marriage of Caterina and Girolamo was celebrated on 17 January 1473, but consummated four years later (1477) when Caterina reached the age of fourteen, without giving further details about the broken betrothal with Costanza.\n\nPope Sixtus IV gave Girolamo the Lordship of Imola, already a Sforza city, but at the time a fief of the Riario family. After a triumphal entrance into Imola in 1477, Caterina went to Rome with her husband, where he lived for many years in the service of his uncle, the Pope. The following year, in March 1478, Caterina gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Bianca after both Girolamo's mother, Bianca della Rovere, and Caterina's paternal grandmother, Bianca Maria Visconti. Caterina subsequently gave birth to five more children in the next nine years.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century, Rome was no longer a medieval city, but not yet the important centre of artistic endeavors it would become a few decades later as one of the most important cities of the Renaissance. Upon her arrival in May 1477, Caterina found a city full of cultural fervour, with a desire for renovation.\n\nThe atmosphere was a mix of intrigue and power, which was pursued without scruples, with material interests far exceeding the spiritual. Caterina was banned by her husband from meddling in politics, but she quickly integrated—owing to her extroverted and sociable character—into aristocratic Roman society.\n\nAs evidenced by correspondence from that period, Caterina immediately became admired as one of the most beautiful and elegant among noble Roman women. She was welcomed everywhere, treated with great respect and lavishly praised by all of society including the Pope, and she soon transformed from a simple adolescent into a refined and powerful intermediary between the Roman court and other Italian courts, especially Milan.\n\nGirolamo was given a leading position in the expansion policy of Pope Sixtus IV after the premature death of the Pope's favoured nephew, Cardinal Pietro Riario. His power grew daily, and he soon displayed increasing ruthlessness towards his enemies. In 1480, the Pope, with the objective of attaining a strong domain in the land of Romagna, assigned Girolamo the lordship of Forlì, which had remained vacant after it was sequestered from the Ordelaffi family. The new lord tried to earn the favour of the populace by erecting magnificent public buildings and churches, and by abolishing taxes.\n\nThe lives of Caterina and Girolamo changed abruptly with the death of Sixtus IV on 12 August 1484.\n\nWhen Pope Sixtus IV died, rebellions and disorder immediately spread through Rome, including looting of his supporters' residences. Girolamo's residence, the Orsini palace in Campo de' Fiori, was stripped of its content and almost destroyed.\n\nIn this time of anarchy, Caterina, who was in her seventh month of pregnancy, crossed the Tiber on horseback to occupy the \"rocca\" (fortress) of Castel Sant'Angelo on behalf of her husband. From this position and with the obedience of the soldiers, Caterina could monitor the Vatican and dictate the conditions for the new conclave.\n\nMeanwhile, the disorder in the city increased. A militia accompanied the arrival of the cardinals. The latter did not want to attend the funeral of Sixtus IV and refused to enter into conclave, for fear of coming under the fire of Caterina's artillery. The situation was difficult because only the election of a new Pope would put an end to the violence in Rome. Unsuccessful attempts to persuade her to leave the fortress failed, as she was determined to give it only to the new Pope, saying that Pope Sixtus had bestowed its control to her family.\n\nGirolamo and his army occupied a strategic position at that point, yet could not implement an effective solution. The Sacred College asked Girolamo to leave Rome, offering in return the confirmation of his lordship over Imola and Forlì, the military post of captain-general of the Church, and 8,000 ducats in compensation for the damages to his property. Girolamo accepted. When Caterina was informed of the decisions taken by her husband, she increased the quota of her soldiers and made preparations for resistance in order to force the cardinals to parley with her. The cardinals again approached Girolamo, who took up a position against his wife. On 25 October 1484, Caterina surrendered the fortress to the Sacred College and left Rome with her family. The Sacred College were then able to meet in conclave to elect the new Pope.\n\nIn Forlì, law and order had been maintained by Caterina's uncle Ludovico il Moro Sforza, Duke of Milan. On their arrival, the Riarios learned of the election of Giovanni Battista Cybo, an old opponent, as Pope Innocent VIII. He confirmed Girolamo in his lordships of Imola and Forlì and his appointment as captain-general. That appointment, however, was only nominal; Girolamo had no real control over the papal army and Innocent VIII refused to pay Girolamo for leaving Rome.\n\nDespite the loss of income, Girolamo did not reinstate taxes on the people of Forlì.\n\nThis situation lasted until the end of 1485, when the city government completely ran out of money. Girolamo, pressed by a member of the Council of Elders, Nicolò Pansecco, was forced to levy taxes. The taxes were deemed excessive by the population and led to Girolamo's increased unpopularity among all citizens of Forlì.\n\nThe tax increase, which affected mainly the artisan class and landowners, added to the discontent that had previously been limited to the families who had suffered under Girolamo's persecution of those whom he suspected of treachery. His enemies began to conspire against him with a view to making Franceschetto Cybo, the illegitimate son of Pope Innocent, lord of Imola and Forlì in his stead.\n\nAfter more than a half dozen failed attempts, Girolamo was killed on 14 April 1488 by a conspiracy led by the Orsis, a noble family of Forlì. The lord's palace was sacked, while Caterina and her children were made prisoners.\n\nThe fortress of Ravaldino, a central part of the defensive system of the city, refused to surrender to the Orsis. Caterina offered to attempt to persuade the castellan, Tommaso Feo, to submit. The Orsis believed Caterina because she left her children as hostages, but once inside she let loose a barrage of vulgar threats and promises of vengeance against her former captors. According to one rumour, when they threatened to kill her children, Caterina, standing in the walls of the fortress exposed her genitals and said: \"\" ('Do it, if you want to: hang them even in front of me ... here I have what's needed to make others!'). This story, however, is most likely an untrue embellishment. The historical record tells that Caterina, in fact, said she was pregnant. Although her statement that she was pregnant is, by most historians, considered to have been a ruse, it rendered worthless any power the conspirators had in holding her children, Girolamo's legitimate heirs.\n\nShocked by this response, the Orsis did not dare touch the Riario children. With the assistance of her uncle Ludovico il Moro (very interested in securing some influence in the Romagna, to counter the influence of Venice), Caterina defeated her enemies and regained possession of her dominions.\n\nOn 30 April 1488, Caterina became regent for her eldest son Ottaviano, formally recognised by all the members of the Comune and the head of the magistrates as the new Lord of Forlì that day, but too young to exercise power directly.\n\nCaterina's first act as Regent of Forlì was to avenge the death of her husband, according to the custom of the time. She ordered that all those involved in the Orsi conspiracy were to be imprisoned, along with the Pope's governor, Monsignor Savelli, all the pontifical generals, and the castellan of the fortress of Forlimpopoli, and also all women of the Orsis and other families who had assisted in the conspiracy. Soldiers sought out all who had taken part in the conspiracy. Houses owned by those imprisoned were razed while their valuables were distributed to the poor.\n\nOn 30 July news came that Pope Innocent VIII had given Ottaviano Riario the official investiture of his state \"until his line ended\". In the meantime, Forlì was visited by Cardinal Raffaele Riario, officially to protect the orphan children of his late cousin Girolamo but actually, to oversee the government of Caterina.\n\nThe young Countess personally dealt with all issues concerning the government of her city-state, both public and private. To consolidate her power, she exchanged gifts with the lords of neighbouring states and involved herself in marriage negotiations for her children. She decreased taxes by reducing some and eliminating others, and sharply controlled her realm's spending. Caterina dealt directly with the training of her militia in the use of weapons and horses. It was her intention that her cities and towns be orderly and peaceful, and she expected her subjects to appreciate these efforts.\n\nThe states of Forlì and Imola were smaller than the great Italian states but, due to their geographical position, had a considerable strategic importance on the political affairs. In those years there were significant events that changed the geopolitical situation of Italy. Lorenzo il Magnifico, whose shrewd policy had curbed claims and rivalries of the various Italian states, died on 8 April 1492. Pope Innocent VIII also died on 25 July of that year, and was replaced by Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who took the name of Pope Alexander VI. His election seemed to strengthen Caterina's rule. While she and her husband had lived in Rome, the Cardinal had often been a guest at their home, and he was godfather to Ottaviano.\n\nThese events directly threatened the stability and peace in Italy. With the death of Lorenzo there came about friction between the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples, leading up to the crisis of September 1494, when, incited by Ludovico il Moro, King Charles VIII of France entered into Italy to claim Naples as the Anjou heir. At first Pope Alexander VI also gave his support to Charles' claim, leading to four years of war.\n\nDuring the conflict between Naples and Milan, Caterina, who knew that she was placed in a strategic position of passage for anyone who wanted to go to the south, tried to remain neutral. She knew Forlì was exposed to invasion, located in a strategic position on the way to Rome. On one side, her uncle Ludovico had allied with Charles VIII; on the other side, Pope Alexander VI now opposed France's ambitions in Italy, and her brother-in-law, Cardinal Riario, argued in favour of the incumbent King Ferdinand II. Caterina chose to join Naples and the Pope, and prepared the defence of Imola and Forlì against the French.\n\nBetrayed by her Neapolitan allies, who at the first French attack did not help her, Caterina changed sides and submitted to Charles VIII, giving his army \"via libera\" (\"free passage\") to Naples; however, he preferred to avoid the Romagna and cross the Apennines, following the road of the Cisa pass. Naples was conquered by the French army in only 13 days. This frightened the Italian principalities, and they formed the League of Venice against Charles VIII. The League defeated the French King at the Fornovo and he was forced to retreat to France.\n\nThis time, Caterina managed to remain neutral. By not participating in the expulsion of the French, she maintained the support of both her uncle Ludovico in Milan (now legitimate Duke of Milan) and also that of the Pope.\n\nTwo months after the death of Girolamo, a rumour was spread that Caterina was close to marrying Antonio Maria Ordelaffi, who had started to court her. This marriage would end the claims of the Ordelaffi family on the city of Forlì. Antonio Maria, feeling confident, wrote to the Duke of Ferrara that the Countess promised to marry him. When Caterina saw how things stood, she imprisoned those who had spread the false news. These promises were addressed by the Senate in Venice, which summoned Antonio Maria to Friuli, where he remained confined for ten years.\n\nIn point of fact, Caterina had fallen in love with Giacomo Feo, the brother of Tommaso Feo, the castellan who had remained faithful to her after the assassination of her husband. Caterina married him in 1488, but secretly, to avoid losing custody of her children and the regency of her dominions.\n\nAll the contemporary chronicles reported that Caterina was madly in love with the young Giacomo. It was feared that she could strip her son Ottaviano of his future lordship, in order to give it to her lover and secret husband.\n\nGiacomo was appointed castellan of the fortress of Ravaldino in place of his brother, and was awarded with an order of chivalry from Ludovico il Moro. In April 1489, Caterina gave birth to Giacomo's son, Bernardino, later called \"Carlo\" in honour of King Charles VIII, who had made Giacomo a baron of France. Also, she had replaced the castellans of the fortresses of her dominions with her closest relatives: the fortress of Imola was given to Gian Piero Landriani, her stepfather, and the fortress of Forlimpopoli to Piero Landriani, her half-brother, while Tommaso Feo was married to Bianca Landriani, Caterina's half-sister.\n\nAt Tossignano, a conspiracy was formed to seize the fortress in the name of Ottaviano, and murder both Giacomo and Caterina. The Countess discovered the plot and imprisoned or executed those who were involved. Immediately after this conspiracy was foiled, another plot was organised by Antonio Maria Ordelaffi, who had never become resigned to the loss of Forlí, but this also failed.\n\nGiacomo's power increased, and with his cruelty and insolence he incurred the hatred of all, including Caterina's children. On one occasion, in full view of the public, he slapped Ottaviano (the rightful Lord of Forlì), but nobody had the courage to defend the boy. After this incident, adherents of Ottaviano decided to liberate the city from the domination of Giacomo Feo.\n\nGian Antonio Ghetti and some of Caterina's own children formed a conspiracy. On the evening of 27 August 1495, Caterina, Giacomo Feo and their entourage were returning from a hunt. Caterina, her daughter Bianca Riario and some of her ladies-in-waiting rode in a carriage, followed on horseback by Giacomo, Ottaviano and his brother Cesare and many \"staffieri\" and soldiers. Agents of the conspiracy attacked and mortally wounded Giacomo. The same day, Ghetti went to Caterina, thinking that she had secretly given the order to kill Giacomo. Caterina was unaware of the plot, and her revenge was terrible. When her first husband was murdered, she avenged his death according to the justice of the time; now she reacted with vindictive fury. Caterina was not satisfied with mere executions: their deaths had to be among the most cruel and painful. She not only prosecuted the wives and mistresses of the conspirators, but she also sought out the children, even those in early infancy, and all were summarily tortured and executed.\n\nCaterina's fury blinded her to the politics that had inspired the plot. It had involved almost all the supporters of Ottaviano Riario, who were convinced that Caterina had given her tacit consent to the killing of the man who was considered the \"usurper\" of the state's rightful ruler. They had wanted to uphold the power of the Riario family. As a result of the massacre which followed the assassination of Giacomo Feo, Caterina lost, forever, the good will of her people.\n\nIn 1496, the ambassador of the Republic of Florence, Giovanni de' Medici il Popolano, paid a visit to Caterina. The second son of Pierfrancesco il Vecchio, he belonged to a collateral branch of the Medici family. Along with his older brother Lorenzo, he had been sent into exile because of his open hostility toward their cousin Piero, who succeeded his father Lorenzo il Magnifico in the government of Florence. In 1494, when Charles VIII invaded Italy, Piero was forced to sign a treaty which allowed the French army to move freely into the Kingdom of Naples. The people of Florence were liberated, deposed Piero and proclaimed a Republic. Giovanni and his brother were able to return to their homeland. They renounced the Medici surname and took the name of \"Popolano\". The Florentine government appointed Giovanni as ambassador to Forlì.\n\nShortly after coming to Forlì, Giovanni and his entourage were housed in the apartments adjacent to Caterina's in the fortress of Ravaldino. The rumours of a possible marriage between Giovanni and Caterina and that Ottaviano Riario accepted the post of Condottiero from Florence threatened by the Venetians, alarmed all the lords of the League and the Duke of Milan.\n\nCaterina could not hide her wedding plans and her own feelings from her uncle Ludovico; she truly fell in love with the handsome, charming, and intelligent Giovanni. The situation differed from the previous one as this time Caterina had the approval of her children and she also obtained the consent of her uncle. The marriage of two people from such powerful families, however, was likely to arouse opposition, so they were wed in secret in September 1497.\n\nIn April 1498, Caterina bore Giovanni a son, the last of her children. The child was baptised as Ludovico after his mother's uncle, the Duke of Milan, but later he became known by the name Giovanni delle Bande Nere.\n\nMeanwhile, affairs between Florence and Venice were getting worse and Caterina, who occupied the main route between the two cities, prepared her defences. She sent a contingent of knights to the aid of Florence, led by Giovanni and her eldest son, Ottaviano Riario, accompanied by men she had trained herself.\n\nGiovanni became seriously ill and was compelled to leave the battlefield and return to Forlì. There, despite treatment, his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to Santa Maria in Bagno, where he hoped for a miraculous recovery. On 14 September 1498, Giovanni died in the presence of Caterina, who had been summoned urgently to attend him. Giovanni's death left Caterina alone to face the Borgias.\n\nAfter having returned to Forlì in order to make preparations for the defence of her states, Caterina was occupied by military concerns, especially logistics. Training the militia was executed by the Countess in person. To find additional money and troops, she wrote to her uncle Ludovico, the Republic of Florence and the neighbouring states who were her allies. Only the Dukes of Milan and Mantua sent a small contingent of soldiers to aid her.\n\nAfter an initial attack by the Venetians, which inflicted severe destruction, Caterina's army managed to outmanoeuvre them. Afterwards, the war continued with minor skirmishes until the Venetians were able to circumvent Forlì to reach Florence by another route.\n\nBecause of this staunch defence, Caterina Sforza gained the nickname of \"\" ('The Tiger').\n\nIn the meantime, Louis XII had succeeded to the French throne. Louis claimed the rights both to the Duchy of Milan as a grandson of Valentina Visconti, and to the Kingdom of Naples as heir to the House of Anjou. Before starting his campaign in Italy, Louis XII secured an alliance with Savoy, the Republic of Venice and Pope Alexander VI. In the summer of 1499, he came to Italy with a formidable army; without having to fight a single battle, he occupied Piedmont, as well as Genoa and Cremona. On 6 October, he settled in Milan, which had been abandoned the previous month by Duke Ludovico, who fled to the Tyrol under the protection of his nephew-by-marriage Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nAlexander VI allied himself with Louis XII in return for the King's support in establishing Alexander's son Cesare Borgia, the Duke of Valentinois, as ruler in Romagna. Alexander issued a Papal Bull on 9 March 1499 to invalidate the investiture of the feudal lords, including Caterina.\n\nWhen the French army left Milan with Cesare to begin the conquest of Romagna, Ludovico il Moro regained the Duchy with the help of the Austrians.\n\nCaterina sought relief from Florence against the approaching French army, but Florence was threatened by the Pope, so she was left alone to defend herself. She immediately began to recruit and train many soldiers and began to store weapons, ammunition and food. She reinforced the defences, especially that of Ravaldino where she resided and which was already considered impenetrable. She also sent her children to Florence.\n\nOn 24 November, Cesare Borgia arrived in Imola. The city gates were opened by the inhabitants, and he was able to take possession, after having conquered the fortress where the castellan Dionigi Naldi of Brisighella had resisted for several days. After seeing what had happened there, Caterina asked the people of Forlì if they also wanted to capitulate to Borgia, or if they wanted to be defended and endure the resulting siege. Because the people hesitated in answering, Caterina absolved the citizens of Forlì of their oath of fealty, and sealed herself in Ravaldino.\n\nOn 19 December, the Duke of Valentinois also took possession of Forlì and began the siege of the fortress. Caterina repeatedly refused all offers of peace, from Cesare and from Cardinal Riario. In response, Cesare offered 10,000 ducats for her, dead or alive. Caterina tried to capture Cesare when he came near the fortress to talk to her, but the attempt failed.\n\nFor several days the artillery of both factions engaged in a mutual bombardment: Caterina's cannon inflicted heavy losses on the French army, but the French artillery damaged the defences of the main fortress. What was destroyed during the day was rebuilt during the night.\n\nCaterina's solitary resistance was admired throughout all Italy; Niccolò Machiavelli reports that many songs and epigrams were composed in her honour. All were lost except that of Marsilio Compagnon.\n\nAs time passed without decisive results, Cesare changed his tactics. His troops bombarded the walls of the fortress continuously, even at night. After six days, they opened two breaches in the walls. On 12 January 1500, his forces stormed the fortress. The bloody battle was quick and decisive, and Caterina continued to resist, fighting with weapons in hand until she was taken prisoner. Among the gentlemen who were caught together with her, was also her secretary, Marcantonio Baldraccani. Immediately she surrendered herself to Antoine Bissey (the \"bailli\" of Dijon) as a prisoner of the French, as she knew there was a law that prevented French forces from holding women as prisoners of war.\n\nAccording to Machiavelli, the defense operations were misdirected by Giovanni da Casale: \"The poorly built fortress and the scant prudence of the defender, therefore, brought disgrace to the magnanimous enterprise of the Countess ...\".\n\nCesare obtained custody of Caterina from the French general, Yves d'Allègre, promising that he would treat her not as a prisoner but as a guest. Caterina and her entourage were therefore forced to go with the army that was preparing to conquer Pesaro. The conquest had to be postponed because on 5 February Ludovico il Moro returned to Milan, forcing French troops to turn back.\n\nCesare departed alone with the Papal army for Rome, where he took Caterina. In Rome, she was held in the Belvedere Palace. Towards the end of March, Caterina tried to escape but she was discovered and immediately imprisoned at Castel Sant'Angelo.\n\nTo justify Caterina's imprisonment, Pope Alexander VI accused her of trying to kill him in November 1499 with letters impregnated with poison, as a response to the Papal bull which had deprived the countess of her fiefdoms.\n\nEven today it is not known if the accusation was founded or not. Machiavelli believed that Caterina had tried to poison the Pope, while other historians, such as Jacob Burckhardt and Ferdinand Gregorovius, are not certain. An inconclusive and unfinished trial took place, and Caterina remained imprisoned until 30 June 1501, when she was released by Yves d'Allègre, who had come to Rome with the army of Louis XII for the conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. Alexander VI alleged that Caterina signed documents renouncing all of her fiefs, because in the meantime his son Cesare, with the acquisition of Pesaro, Rimini and Faenza, was appointed Duke of Romagna.\n\nAfter a brief stay in the residence of Cardinal Riario, Caterina embarked from Livorno to Florence, where her children were waiting for her.\n\nIn Florence, Caterina lived in the villas which had belonged to her third husband Giovanni de' Medici, often staying at the Villa Medici di Castello. Soon, she complained of being mistreated and living in a straitened financial situation.\n\nFor many years she conducted a legal battle against her brother-in-law Lorenzo de' Medici for the custody of her son Giovanni, who was entrusted to him during her detention. In 1504, her son was finally returned to her, because the judge recognized that her confinement as a prisoner of war was not comparable to the detention of a criminal.\n\nWith the death of Pope Alexander VI on 18 August 1503, Cesare Borgia lost all his power. This reopened the possibility of restoring to power all the old feudal lords of the Romagna who had been deposed. Caterina lost no time in sending letters to adherents, and pleaded her case to Pope Julius II in her own name and that of her son Ottaviano Riario. The new Pope was favourable to restoring the lordships of Imola and Forlì to the Riarios, but the populace of both cities declared that a majority of the people opposed the return of the Countess, so that the domain passed instead to Antonio Maria Ordelaffi on 22 October 1503.\n\nAfter having lost her last chance to return to her former power, Caterina spent the last years of her life dedicated to her children, in particular to her youngest son Giovanni (her favourite and the most like her in personality and character). She also conducted a series of experiments in alchemy, the results of which were recorded in a manuscript titled \"Gli Experimenti de la Ex.ma S.r Caterina da Furlj Matre de lo inllux.mo S.r Giouanni de Medici\", or \"Gli Experimenti\". The book, dating back to 1500, contains a total of 454 recipes, roughly 66 of which are cosmetic related, 358 medicinal, and 38 alchemical. Her experimental activities situate her at the origins of a Medici interest that stretched well into the seventeenth century.\n\nIn April 1509 Caterina was stricken by a severe case of pneumonia. She appeared to have recovered, but had a relapse of the disease, after which she made her will and arranged her burial. At the age of forty-six years, \"The Tiger of Forlì\", who had \"frightened all of Romagna\", died on 28 May 1509. Her body was placed in a small tomb in the chapel of Le Murate in Florence, a convent of nuns whom Caterina had befriended during her time in that city, and where she had kept a cell as a spiritual retreat. During the 1830s the nuns were forced to leave the property, and in 1845 it was redesigned as a prison. Sometime during this renovation, Caterina's body was lost.\n\nFrom her first marriage with Girolamo Riario, Caterina had six children:\n\nFrom her second marriage with Giacomo Feo, Caterina had one son:\n\nFrom her third marriage to Giovanni de' Medici, Caterina had one son:\n\nIn June 1537, 28 years after Caterina's death, her grandson Cosimo de' Medici, the only son of her own son Giovanni, became the Duke of Florence and in 1569, the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Through him, Caterina was the direct ancestress of the later Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the Dukes of Modena and Reggio, and the Kings of Spain and France.\n\nIn her book \"The Warrior Queens: Boadicea's Chariot\", British historian Antonia Fraser presents Caterina Sforza as a contrasting figure to her contemporary Isabella I of Castile. Fraser points out that whilst the murders ordered by Caterina were no worse than the massacres ordered by Isabella, historians have been much harsher in their judgment of the former. Fraser accounts for this by pointing out that Isabella's actions were sanctioned by the Church, as they were carried out in the name of Catholicism, whilst Caterina's were motivated by the personal, secular desire to preserve her property and rights.\n\n\nCaterina is one of the few women discussed by Machiavelli at length. The incident of her having shown her genitalia in regaining the fortress of Ravaldino was recounted at some length by him in his \"Discourses on Livy\", and his \"Florentine Histories\", while being only briefly mentioned in his \"Prince\". Elizabeth Lev wrote on the matter in her biography of Caterina Sforza, The Tigress of Forli. Lev took the position that Machiavelli's account on the matter, being quite vulgar, may in fact have been more a reflection of his own dislike of Caterina. Indeed, Machiavelli had met the countess as a young diplomat and had not fared well. Various historical records tells us instead that Caterina claimed that even if they killed their children, she had everything was needed to make another one and to prove that, she lifted up her skirts and showed her genitalia, thereby neutralising the conspirators' power in holding her children hostage.\n\n\nThe Identification of Caterina Sforza in Renaissance Paintings through Symbolism.\n"}

It is currently maintained by Chet Ramey as part of the GNU Project.\n\nIt allows users to move the text cursor, search the command history, control a kill ring (a more flexible version of a copy/paste clipboard) and use tab completion on a text terminal. As a cross-platform library, readline allows applications on various systems to exhibit identical line-editing behavior.\n\nReadline supports both Emacs and vi editing modes, which determine how keyboard input is interpreted as editor commands. See Editor war#Differences between vi and Emacs.\n\nEmacs editing mode key bindings are taken from the text editor Emacs. \n\nOn some systems, must be used instead of , because the shortcut conflicts with another shortcut. For example, pressing in Xfce's terminal emulator window does not move the cursor forward one word, but activates \"File\" in the menu of the terminal window, unless that is disabled in the emulator's settings.\n\n\nGNU Readline is notable for being a free software library which is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Free software libraries are far more often licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), for example, the GNU C Library, GNU gettext and FLTK. A developer of an application who chooses to link to an LGPL licensed library can use any license for the application. But linking to a \"GPL\" licensed library such as Readline requires the \"entire\" combined resulting application to be licensed under the GPL when distributed, to comply with section 5 of the GPL.\n\nThis licensing was chosen by the FSF on the hopes that it would encourage software to switch to the GPL. An important example of an application changing its licensing to comply with the copyleft conditions of GNU Readline is CLISP, an implementation of Common Lisp. Originally released in 1987, it changed to the GPL license in 1992, after an email exchange between one of CLISP's original authors, Bruno Haible, and Richard Stallman, in which Stallman argued that the linking of readline in CLISP meant that Haible was required to re-license CLISP under the GPL if he wished to distribute the implementation of CLISP which used readline.\n\nAnother response has been to not use this in some projects, making text input use the primitive Unix terminal driver for editing.\n\nAlternative libraries have been created with other licenses so they can be used by software projects which want to implement command line editing functionality, but be released with a non-GPL license.\n\n\nThe following code is in C and must be linked against the readline library by passing a -lreadline flag to the compiler:\n\nint main()\n\n"}

Later, \"All Pakistan Newspapers Society\" was established in 1953 and was headed by Hameed Nizami, Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman, Mian Iftikharuddin, \"Fakhre Matri\", Hamid Mahmood, Yusuf Haroon, Mahmood A. Haroon, A.G. Mirza, Kazi Mohammad Akber, Munawwar Hidayet Ullah, K. M. Hamid Ullah, Anwarul Islam of the newspaper Pakistan Observer, Dacca, Syed Hameed Hussain Naqvi and Tanvir Tahir.\n\nThe older organization, \"Pakistan Newspapers Society\" was established primarily due to the efforts of Hameed Nizami, Altaf Husain, and Hamid Mahmood. It functioned for a number of years but could not receive much support or recognition either from the publishers or the advertising agencies. Other smaller publishers' organizations also functioned, at the same time, in East Pakistan and Karachi.\n\nIn the year 1953, \"All Pakistan Newspapers Society\" was formed by merging the smaller existing groups of publishers. The headquarters were established in Karachi, from where it still continues to operate in 2018.\n\nThe APNS handles problems between its member publications and the provincial or federal governments relating to advertisements, clearance of dues, taxes and duties and newsprint. It sets rules of conduct for member publications and advertising agencies. This gives the Society a mechanism of streamlining advertisements and a clearance system protecting the collective interests of its member publications, advertising agencies, and advertisers.\n\nThe Society also works to develop the science and art of journalism and newspaper industry. In 1981, the APNS instituted advertising awards in various categories. Subsequently, the Journalist Awards were launched in 1982. The awards ceremonies have been held regularly since 1981.\n\nThe APNS grew to include publications from small towns and newspapers in regional languages. Between 1971 and 2003, the number of member publications in the Society rose from 41 to 262. Along with organizations of editors and journalists, the Society worked against the \"Press and Publications Ordinance\" passed by Ayub Khan in 1960 until it was finally repealed in 1988. In 1999, the APNS prepared a set of press laws including the Draft for the formation of Press Council in Pakistan, Registration of Printing Presses, Newspapers Ordinance and a draft for a Freedom of Information Act. After thorough discussions among the All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) people, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) and the Ministry of Information, Government of Pakistan, the drafts on the Press Council and the Registration of Presses and Newspapers were finalized and enacted in 2002.\n\nAfter 2002, the member publications are trying to adopt modern techniques, facilities, and trained manpower in all fields.\n\nIn 2018, All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) asked the Supreme Court of Pakistan to consider Pakistani print media's problems. This action was prompted by the recently expressed fear in the country and reports circulating in the news media that government advertisements in the print media might be stopped or limited. APNS pointed out that the print media in Pakistan, especially the small newspapers, significantly depend on the revenue that comes from these government advertisements.\n\nThe Advertising Awards were initiated in 1981, with Journalist Awards following in 1982. Advertising Awards are given on a 1st position, 2nd position, 3rd position basis and include:\n\nThe Journalist Awards have only one winner in each category. The categories include:\n\nAt an annual meeting of its General Council, All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) unanimously elected its President and its Secretary General for 2018-19.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal from 1975 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. He was the first Italian-Canadian to serve as a cabinet minister in Ontario.\n\nKerrio's grandfather, also named Vincent, emigrated from Italy to Canada at the start of the twentieth century. Kerrio was born in Niagara Falls and educated at Niagara Falls Collegiate Vocational Institute (NFCVI). Kerrio began working in the family business, then Kerrio Welding Works, in the 1930s. The company became Kerrio and Germano Construction and later Kerrio Construction, and the younger Kerrio its president. He was also the president of the Niagara Falls Curling Club. Kerrio and his wife Rose had two sons, Vincent Anthony and Michael. Vincent Anthony succeeded his father in the family business and became a member of Niagara Falls City Council.\n\nHe was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative John Clement by 172 votes in the Niagara Falls riding. He was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1977 and 1981.\n\nThe Ontario Liberal Party, which had been out of office since 1943, formed a minority government after the 1985 provincial election. Kerrio, easily returned in Niagara Falls, was appointed Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Energy on June 26, 1985. He was retained in the former portfolio after the 1987 provincial election. In 1988, Kerrio prohibited mineral exploration and mining activities in Ontario provincial parks. He banned large-scale water exports from Ontario in 1989. He also oversaw the reintroduction of the wild turkey to Ontario.\n\nIn 1988, Kerrio approved the expansion of the Red Squirrel logging road, directly through Anishnabe territory in Temagami, Ontario, Canada. This prompted a series of roadblocks by the Teme-Augama Anishnabai and by environmentalists in 1988-1989. Kerrio was a prominent supporter of the \"Beck 3\" plan to build a third hydroelectric generating station on the Niagara River.\n\nKerrio left cabinet on August 2, 1989, and did not run for re-election in 1990.\n\nKerrio remained a leading figure in Niagara Falls's Italian community. In addition to Kerrio Construction, his family came to run Car-Mar Manufacturing and Niagara Hospitality Inns. He died on October 30, 2009 at Greater Niagara General Hospital where he had been hospitalized with leukemia for six months.\n"}

She was the daughter of John Gunn and Margaret Leask. Little is known of her early life until the summer of 1806, when, under the pseudonym John Fubbister, she entered into a contract with the HBC as a labourer for three years at £8 per year. Although her motivations for doing so are uncertain, tradition holds that she may have been following a lover who had cast her aside. Her brother George was also employed by the HBC, and it is also possible that she was enticed to join by his stories of adventure. Modern commentators point out that the modest HBC salary was nevertheless more than Gunn could have earned as a woman in Orkney at that time. Official HBC policy forbade employment of European women, although First Nation women were employed as cooks and domestic servants in company outposts.\n\nIn the Autumn of 1807 Gunn was assigned to a brigade tasked with provisioning more distant outposts, and travelled with them to Martin Falls and then on to the HBC outpost on the Red River at Pembina in modern North Dakota, a distance of more than . Once again, Gunn worked unsuspected alongside the men. The pretence was maintained until the morning of 29 December 1807, when to general astonishment, Gunn gave birth to a baby boy at the home of Alexander Henry the younger, the chief of the North West Company's Pembina post. According to Henry's journal: \n\nThe father of the baby was reportedly John Scarth, an HBC employee who had been in frequent contact with Gunn. After being found out, Gunn became known as Mary Fubbister, and in early 1808 was ordered to return to Albany, and upon her arrival was no longer allowed to work with the men, but rather offered work as a washerwoman. Against her wishes, Gunn and her child were returned to Scotland on the \"Prince of Wales\" on 20 September 1809. There, she lived in poverty, working as a stocking and mitten maker until her death.\n\nIsobel Gunn's life has subsequently become the basis for a work of historical fiction by author Audrey Thomas, a documentary poem entitled \"The Ballad of Isabel Gunn\" by Stephen Scobie, and the subject of a documentary film entitled \"The Orkney Lad: The Story of Isabel Gunn\", directed by filmmaker Anne Wheeler. Canadian folk singer Eileen McGann also paid tribute with her ballad 'Isabella Gunn'.\n\n\n\n"}

Aside from producing content for release on YouTube, it was also a former humor website owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC) until January 2020 when IAC withdrew funding and the website shut down. Since then, CollegeHumor has continued to release content on YouTube and on its streaming service, Dropout. The site featured daily original humor videos and articles created by its in-house writing and production team, in addition to user-submitted videos, pictures, articles and links. It was created by Josh Abramson and Ricky Van Veen in 1999. CollegeHumor is operated by Electus Digital, which operates Dorkly.com and Watchloud.com in addition to CollegeHumor.\n\nCHMedia is also a partner of the website BustedTees, an online clothing website.\n\nMany of its staff also operated the sister website \"Dorkly\", centering on fandoms and video game parodies in the vein of CollegeHumor before the site ceased publication of new articles in January 2019. Like CollegeHumor, despite the website shutting down, Dorkly continues to release content on YouTube, funded by Lowbrow.\nThe site was created in December 1999 by Josh Abramson and Ricky Van Veen, with help from web developer Jake Lodwick. Abramson and Van Veen were high school friends from Baltimore, Maryland. The site traffic reached approximately 30,000 monthly American users.\n\nAbramson said in an interview that they wanted to start \"an advertisement-based business because at the time the advertising market was pretty hot and we'd seen other people develop Web sites that were popular making a lot of money.\" Their aim was to create a humor site that would appeal to the advertiser-friendly college-aged demographic.\n\nCollegeHumor, along with its parent company, Connected Ventures, was acquired by Barry Diller's IAC in August 2006.\n\nCollegeHumor has become known for its original comedy content. The site has been nominated for the Webby Award in the humor category, and many of their individual videos have been nominated for and/or won Webby Awards.

However Sam Reich later clarified that the company would keep a skeleton crew of mostly technical staff in employment in order to continue releasing pre-recorded CollegeHumor content on its streaming platform Dropout for at least the next 6 months. The only creative left on the payroll was Brennan Lee Mulligan, DM of the Dimension 20 show.\n\nCollegeHumor produces original comedy videos under the CH Originals (formerly known as CHTV) banner.

The cast of players includes Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, and Siobhan Thompson, who collectively became the “main cast” of Dimension 20. Their group of characters, known as “The Bad Kids,” attend the Aguefort Adventuring Academy, a fictional high school designed to teach people how to become adventurers.\n\nThe strong fan response for this first season resulted in Fantasy High being renewed for a fully live season, known as Fantasy High Live:Sophomore Year. Episodes of Fantasy High Live: Sophomore Year were streamed live on Twitch, as opposed to pre-recorded, edited, and uploaded to YouTube. The season concluded with a two part finale titled “Spring Break! I Believe in You!” Part one of the finale was live-streamed on April 1, 2020, and lasted approximately 3 hours. The second part of the finale was live-streamed on April 3, 2020 and lasted approximately 5 hours.

Throughout the course of the season, the characters try to hide the death of their Sauron-esque leader from the rest of his evil armies.\n\nThe third season, titled “The Unsleeping City”, is a modern day campaign set in a magical version of New York. This season featured the main cast as a group of people trying to protect New York residents from knowing about the underlying magic in their city.\n\nThe fourth season, titled “Tiny Heist”, focused on a set of 'tiny people' (i.e., bugs, living toys, etc.) and their attempts to pull off a successful heist. Tiny Heist is Dimension 20’s second “side quest” season, and introduced the cast of The Adventure Zone as guest players along side CollegeHumor’s Jessica Ross and Lily Du.\n\nA fifth season, titled “Crown of Candy”, began on April 8, 2020.

No further details are given about Ongendus, other than that he was \"more savage than any beast and harder than stone\" — the ideal of man in the Viking Age. Against Willibrord's account, however, one should also consider that he was apparently well received, could travel in peace through Ongendus' realm and was allowed to return with his potential disciples, so the savagery of Ongendus may well be overstated. It may just have been the obligatory classification of any heathen ruler.\n\n\n"}

He was most notably a member of FC Barcelona and the Philadelphia 76ers. At 2.12 m (6 ft 11 in) in height, he played at the center position.\n\nRentzias played his first basketball for the amateur team Danaos, a local team of Trikala. He began his professional career at the age of 17 with PAOK Thessaloniki of the Greek League in the 1993–94 season. With PAOK, he won the Korać Cup championship in the 1993–94 season, and the Greek Cup title in the 1994–95 season.\n\nOriginally selected with the 23rd overall pick by the Denver Nuggets in the 1996 NBA draft, while under contract with PAOK, Rentzias opted not to play in the NBA at that time.\n\nHe later transferred to the Spanish club Barcelona Bàsquet for the 1997–98 season. In his last year with Barcelona (2001–02), Rentzias averaged 9.2 points per game and 3.5 rebounds per game, in 17.3 minutes per contest, in 51 games played, in both the Spanish League (ACB) and the EuroLeague. He shot 61.6 percent from the field, 36.3 percent from three-point range, and 71.4 percent from the foul line. With Barcelona, Rentzias won his second Korać Cup championship in the 1998–99 season, and he also won 2 Spanish League championships in the 1998–99 and 2000–01 seasons.\n\nIn his only season in the NBA, during the 2002–03 campaign with the 76ers, he played in only 35 games, averaging 1.5 points per game. He was the second Greek-born basketball player at the time to ever suit up for an NBA team.\n\nHe subsequently played for Ülkerspor (Turkish League), Montepaschi Siena (Italian League), and Forum Valladolid (Spanish League).\n\nRentzias had plans to come back to PAOK to finish his career. Unfortunately, in August 2006, he announced his retirement from basketball at the age of 30, because of injury problems.\n\nRentzias was a part of the junior Greek national basketball teams. With Greece's junior national teams he won the silver medal at the 1991 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship and the gold medal at the 1993 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship. Rentzias was named the MVP of the 1995 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, helping Greece to win the tournament's gold medal. In the process, Greece beat (by a score of 98–78) a U.S. team that featured future NBA players like Vince Carter, Trajan Langdon, Stephon Marbury, and Samaki Walker. During that period, Rentzias was considered to be one of the most talented young European basketball players.\n\nRentzias was also a member of the senior men's Greek national basketball team, from 1992 to 2003, and he competed at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games. That was the just the second ever appearance by Greece's senior men's basketball team in a Summer Olympic Games, and their first since the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympic Games. He averaged 5.0 points and 4.1 rebounds, in 12 minutes per game, over seven contests in the 1996 Olympic Games tournament.\n\nHe also played at the EuroBasket 1995, the EuroBasket 1997, the EuroBasket 2001, the EuroBasket 2003, the 1994 FIBA World Championship, and the 1998 FIBA World Championship, with the Greek national squad.\n\nIn June 26, 1996 Efthimios Rentzias was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the 1st round (23rd pick) of the 1996 NBA Draft.\nIn September 29, 1997 was traded by the Denver Nuggets with a 2000 2nd round draft pick (Hanno Möttölä was later selected) to the Atlanta Hawks for Priest Lauderdale.\n\nIn June 26, 2002: Traded by the Atlanta Hawks to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2004 2nd round draft pick (Royal Ivey was later selected) and a 2006 2nd round draft pick (Daniel Gibson was later selected).\n\nIn August 8, 2003: Waived by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Russell is the name of an American military installation near Marfa, Texas, that was active from 1911 to 1946. Its namesake is David Allen Russell, a Civil War general killed at the Battle of Opequon, September 19, 1864.\n\nIt was established in 1911 as Camp Albert, a base for cavalry and air reconnaissance units sent to protect West Texas from Mexican bandits after the Pancho Villa raid.\n\nThe base was expanded and renamed Camp Marfa during World War I. In the interwar years, the base became the headquarters for the Marfa Command, which replaced the Big Bend District. In 1924, a patrol called the Mounted Watchmen was established to deter persons from crossing the Rio Grande into the United States.\n\nIn 1930, the base was renamed Fort D. A. Russell. The name had been used on a previous military base in Wyoming; the name became available when that post was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren.\n\nThe base was briefly abandoned during the Great Depression. On January 2, 1933, the Army closed the post, and reactivated it in 1935 as the home base of the 77th Field Artillery.\n\nDuring World War II, the post was expanded and used as an air base, a base for a WAC unit, a training facility for chemical mortar battalions, and a base for troops guarding the U.S.-Mexican border. The Marfa Army Airfield was constructed nearby and was used as pilot training facility.\n\nGerman prisoners of war were also housed in a POW camp on the base.\n\nIn 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, the fort was closed during America's demobilization. On October 23, 1946, the base was transferred to the Corps of Engineers. The Texas National Guard assumed control of the base shortly afterward. In 1949, most of the base's land was divided up and sold to local citizens.\n\nIn the late 1970s, under the auspices of the Dia Art Foundation, the artist Donald Judd acquired the former fort and began converting the buildings to house permanent large-scale art installations. Originally conceived to include works by Judd, John Chamberlain, and Dan Flavin, the museum was later expanded to include works by Carl Andre, Ingolfur Arnarrson, Ilya Kabakov, Roni Horn, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, David Rabinowitch, and John Wesley. Judd's museum opened to the public in 1986 as the Chinati Foundation.\nLocated at Fort David A. Russell's central complex is Building 98, a project of the International Woman's Foundation and the home of the iconic World War II German POW murals. The Murals were completed in 1945 by Hans Jürgen Press and Robert Humpel, both German prisoners of war held at the base. The building served as the Bachelor Officer Quarters and as an entertainment center for West Point officers during World War I and the Mexican Revolution. The International Woman's Foundation was responsible for placing Fort D. A. Russell on the National Register of Historic Places, The Foundation has operated an artist-in-residency program and base museum since 2002. In 2002, Mona Blocker Garcia took on the task of creating the foundation for mature women artists and healthful aging, thus preserving the important history of Fort D. A. Russell to its exact state when the fort closed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1835886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835886", "title": "Coventry R.F.C.", "text": "Coventry R.F.C.\n\nCoventry Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based in Coventry, England. The club enjoyed great success during the 1960s and 70s, with many players representing their countries. Coventry's home ground is the Butts Park Arena, which opened in 2004. Between 1921 and 2004, the club played at Coundon Road. The club have recently been promoted into the RFU Championship (the second tier of the English rugby union system) following their promotion from the 2017–18 National League 1.\n\nIn 1874 a group, including members of Stoke Cricket Club, took part in what could be described as the first organised game of rugby football played in Coventry. Played against Allesley Park College in Allesley, it took the form of one half conducted according to rugby rules and the other according to association rules.\n\nThe first headquarters were established at Old Bull Fields and in the formative years Coventry remained pretty well unbeaten. When the ground became enclosed, it became known as the Butts with the first match played there against Stourbridge in 1880. By the late 1890s, involvement began in the Midland Counties Cup which was won a total of five times. The first club captain was Harry Ratliff, who later emigrated to the United States. By now players were winning representative honours, William Judkins becoming the club's first British Lion in 1899 during the tour to Australia – overall, ten Coventry players have over the years worn the famous red jersey.\n\nBen Tuke & H G Wells were the club's first internationals, both representing Ireland in 1894.\n\nW L Oldham became the first of the club's great forwards of the 20th century to represent England. Early in the century the Butts was lost when the professional Northern Union game took brief hold in the city.\n\nBy the end of the First World War, the Butts had been taken over by a local firm and a temporary home was found at the Coventry & North Warwickshire Cricket Ground at Binley Road before Coundon Road was purchased in 1921 and developed as the club's headquarters which was to last for over 80 years.\nWhat was considered to be the first golden era of Coventry rugby came in the mid-1920s when losses were infrequent. That brilliance continued and carried over with Coventry producing six England internationals as well as playing a full part in the early Warwickshire successes in the County Championship. Regular representative matches by now were being staged at Coundon Road, at the same time playing successes for the club were continuing built upon local talent including many schools internationals.\n\nThe years of the Second World War brought more disruption, but from a playing point of view despite the inevitable difficulties, it became one of the most remarkable periods in the club's history. Many players remained locally for essential war work because of the importance of the city as a key engineering centre, and consequently a record 72 games were won in succession, with a number of players becoming Victory Internationals.\nAll that ensured that when hostilities finished the club was immediately into its stride again as success continued. The early 1950s saw something of a dip in fortune, but it was not to last too long as the club continued to produce many international players, not only for England but also Scotland and Wales. In 1958 the Midlands won their first-ever match against a touring side, some two-thirds of the team which defeated Australia coming from the Coventry club. This was also the time when again Coventry players totally dominated the County side, which saw Warwickshire win the title seven times in eight seasons.\n\nThe early 1960s saw the club's players continue to win international honours, indeed by the early 1970s at one time thirteen players from the club were representing England. The RFU Club Knock Competition, later to be known as the John Player Cup, was won in consecutive seasons 1972–73 and 1973–74, the second of which coincided with the centenary celebrations. Merit tables were then beginning to come on the scene, the early years seeing the club at the top end of both the England & Wales versions. The 1980s, however, saw a dip in playing fortune and when league rugby was first introduced in 1987 the club spent just one season in what is now known as the Premiership.\n\nThe next ten years or so became something of a struggle before the 1996–97 season which would be Coventry's most successful of the modern era, coming within touching distance of the Premiership. Along the way they beat a Newcastle Falcons side featuring fifteen internationals by 19 – 18 at Coundon Road. They would eventually finish third to the well-funded Newcastle and champions Richmond but lost a promotion play-off to London Irish despite taking a narrow first leg advantage to Sunbury. Remarkably considering their second-tier status, both Danny Grewcock and Rob Hardwick were capped by England in this era. It was however to be at severe cost for in a little over twelve months serious financial difficulties hit the club before a rescue package was put together in time for the 1999–2000 season.\n\nBy now, however, Coundon Road was in need of considerable investment and after some eighty-four years the decision was made to move away and back full circle to the club's beginnings. The Butts Park Arena saw its first game in September 2004, but again financial difficulties were to bite and it took the considerable efforts of members, supporters, former players and local companies to rescue the situation during the summer of 2008. Even then, during the 2009–10 season it took the combined efforts of the Advisory Board to keep the club afloat before the first Board Of Directors was formed. Relegation predictably followed from the Championship, with the club regrouping in National League 1 for the 2010–11 season with the club going part-time again. Steady progress has followed under the guidance of the Board, the desired aim being to climb back up the leagues but not at any cost financially.\n\nThe traditional local rivals are Moseley, with whom Cov enjoyed a regular and popular Boxing Day fixture. It was long considered one of English rugby's premier derbies. After decades in the top echelons of the game, both sides competed in the inaugural season of top- tier league rugby when it was instituted in 1987, but have since spent time bouncing between the first, second and third tiers (primarily the latter two). Recently a pre- season friendly has been arranged when the teams are not in the same division. Cardiff and London Welsh were regular visitors to Coundon Road, promoting strong rivalries, with David Duckham scoring the most impressive try of his career against London Welsh in a match in 1973.\n\nPrior to League Rugby, clubs were ranked in Merit Tables, the most prominent for English clubs being the Sunday Telegraph Merit Tables. Coventry were crowned 'winners' 3 times between 1964 and 1987 (70, 73 and 83), making them the joint 2nd most successful English team of the period, alongside Bristol and Leicester Tigers and behind London Welsh.\n\nIn 1987 the RFU implemented a National League system. Below is a list summarising Coventry's final league positions:\n\n\n\nThe Coventry squad for the 2019–20 season is:\n\nThe Coventry Academy squad is:\n\nIn conjunction with Henley College, Coventry, the club jointly runs the \"Coventry Rugby Development Centre\". It \"...provides an educational and player pathway for talented rugby players to progress to the Coventry Rugby Club 1st team and development team squads\".\n\n\nIn 1998, Keith Fairbrother, a former player for the club, became chairman. Fairbrother took over the club after it had gone into receivership that year (a role he would hold for eight years). In April 2004, Coventry played its final game at Coundon Road, its home for eighty-three years.\n\nOn 23 August 2006, Andrew Green became the new owner and chairman of the club when he bought the controlling company (Butts Park Ventures (Coventry) Ltd) from Keith Fairbrother. Green was a former player and chief executive of Reading.\n\nApoua Stewart, the Samoan international full back, was suspended for two years on 1 November 2006 after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine. In doing so, he became the first Coventry player to fail a drug test. Stewart gave a positive sample after the game against Earth Titans at the Butts Park Arena on 9 September 2006. He admitted the offence when he appeared before a Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel at the Filton Holiday Inn Hotel in Bristol.\n\nOn 15 November 2006, the coach Mike Umaga, older brother of Tana Umaga, was also suspended following unspecified allegations. He resigned a fortnight later on 27 November 2006. Murray Henderson was appointed.\n\nThe following season, after a series of poor results, Coventry announced that Henderson would be moved within the club from 17 December 2007. Phil Maynard took over coaching responsibilities.\n\nOn 1 December 2009, it was reported that club owner Andrew Green had put the club into voluntary liquidation. It was later reported that this attempt had failed and that the club would instead go into administration. On 8 January 2010 it was announced that the club had come out of administration with the formation of a new company Coventry Rugby Ltd with investment from businessman Jon Bowles.\n\nThe 2010–11 season saw the return of Phil Maynard, and although the club were relegated to National League 1, the management saw him as the man to start the new era at Coventry Rugby Club. A whole new squad was formed, alongside new coaching staff for the 2010–2011 with the aim of avoiding consecutive relegation's.\n\nAlthough it was announced that the 2011–12 budget would be lower than that of the previous season, the starting squad for 2011–12 appeared to contain more players vying for first XV team football. Mid- Season, Peter Rossborough stepped aside for Jon Sharpe to become Club Chairman\n\nThe 2012–13 season ended with Coventry in 9th place in National League 1. Following this, for the start of the 2013–14 season, ex Welsh International 2nd row Scott Morgan become Head Coach, while retaining a playing role.\n\nThe following season, on 29 March 2014, Cliffie Hodgson broke the club's all time point scoring record, beating Steve Gough's record which had stood since the 1998–99 season. A 4th-placed finish was Coventry's most competitive season since being relegated into National League One. Inconsistent away form prevented them from truly challenging for promotion.\n\nDuring the 2014–2015 season, on 24 January 2015, Coventry beat their previous wartime record for consecutive victories with a 32 – 22 home win over Cinderford. The winning run of sixteen games ended with a 28 – 28 draw away at Richmond on 31 January 2015. The unbeaten run continued for another fortnight eventually reaching 18 games. It put the team in a position to challenge the league's only full-time professional side Ealing, who they'd beaten on the run, for the top spot before results tailed off. Coventry finished 3rd.\n\nFollowing the improvement of the previous campaign and an ambitious recruitment policy over the summer, there was optimism for a serious promotion push in 2015–2016. A crushing 50-point pre-season victory against famous old foes Cardiff and bonus point wins in the opening two league fixtures reinforced ambitions. However, a series of disappointing and unexpected results, poor form and injuries saw Cov drop into the bottom half of the table where they remained. In early 2016 it was announced Rowland Winter would become the club's full- time Director of Rugby for the 2016–17 season. In February 2016 Cliffie Hodgson became the first Coventry player to exceed 1,000 points in league rugby.\n\nNew Director of Rugby Rowland Winter made wholesale changes to the club's culture, playing and backroom staff prior to the 2016–2017 season. A starting XV of entirely new players turned out in the opening league fixture, a 54 – 14 win versus Loughborough. Narrow defeats and poor away form hampered progress before steady improvement in the second half of the season, the highlight of an 8-game winning streak to finish the season being a 26- 23 home derby win over Moseley in front 2,712 supporters. Coventry finished Winter's first season in 4th place.\n\nAhead of his second campaign Winter retained the core of the squad adding quality and experience including the All Black centre Sam Tuitupou from Sale Sharks, Phil Nilsen from Leeds, England International Luke Narraway from London Irish, Tonga's Latu Makaafi from Doncaster, Jack Preece, Scotland's Alex Grove, Dave Brazier and George Oram (all from local rivals Moseley) and Nile Dacres from fellow promotion chasers Plymouth Albion. In September it was announced club legend (record league points scorer and player to record most league wins as captain) Cliffie Hodgson was being released to join Broadstreet as a Player Coach. On 21 October, Coventry beat Loughborough to record 8 consecutive wins at the start of the new season. In doing so, they equalled the 16-game run of the 2014–15 season. A week later the run was extended to 17 with a win against Cambridge that saw Cov come within 2 minutes of keeping a 3rd consecutive clean sheet. A win away at Moseley on 23 December completed a perfect first half of the season, 15 victories in 15 matches.\n\nOn 17 March 2018, Coventry beat Caldy 55–12 to clinch the league title and win promotion to The Championship, all with 5 games still left to play.\n\nMarquee pre- season friendly victories over local rivals, old and new, preceded Cov's return to The Championship. Traditional rivals, Moseley were beaten 62- 14 whilst a Wasps XV were despatched 55- 14.\n\nA winning return to the second tier was achieved a week later with a 20- 15 victory over Jersey Reds at The Butts Park Arena, a monumental effort considering 2 yellow cards saw Coventry reduced to 13 at one stage.\n\nThat opening day win was followed up by another win next time out at home against Bedford Blues, and then giving eventual title-winners London Irish a massive scare in front of a fervent Butts Park Arena crowd. The home form was key to Coventry establishing themselves back in the Championship at the first time of asking, and while there were agonising late defeats to Nottingham and Bedford - a thriller that saw the teams share over 100 points between them - the season finished on a high with away wins against Doncaster and Jersey and an eight-place finish.\n\nSam Tuitupou and Phil Nilsen both retired at the end of the season, but the squad has been bolstered with the addition of a number of experienced players, namely Joe Buckle (hooker, Yorkshire Carnegie), Ryan Burrows (back row, Newcastle), Gareth Denman (prop, Gloucester), Andy Forsyth (centre, Yorkshire Carnegie), Rory Jennings (fly half, London Scottish), Senitiki Nayolo (back row, Edinburgh) and Stan South (second row, Harlequins), with former England centre Anthony Allen joining from Leicester Tigers as defence coach.\n\nCoventry was one of the premier rugby clubs in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s and many of its players were capped during that time for England. Some notable ex-Coventry players are:\n\nThe following players have played for their country while playing for Coventry.

{"id": "1835887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835887", "title": "Hecate Enthroned", "text": "Hecate Enthroned\n\nHecate Enthroned is a Welsh Symphonic black metal band formed and based in Wrexham. They formed in 1993 as a blackened death metal act under the name Amethyst, changing their name to Daemonum later on. In 1995 the band changed its name to their current one and embraced a symphonic black metal style that was constantly compared to early Cradle of Filth, although since 1999 their work has strayed from their earlier symphonic black metal style and has incorporated more elements of melodic death metal.\n\nThe band's name alludes to the Ancient Greek goddess of magic and necromancy, Hecate.\n\nThe band that would become Hecate Enthroned formed in 1993 in Wrexham, Wales. They were a blackened death metal band by the name of Daemonum (previously known as Amethyst), whose members were Jon Kennedy, Nigel Dennen, Ian Maiden, Mark Watson-Jones, Steve, Gary and Marc. They released in 1993 a demo tape, \"Dreams to Mourn\". In 1994, after being invited by Dani Filth to play bass on his band, Cradle of Filth, Jon left Daemonum and joined Cradle of Filth, briefly replacing Robin Eaglestone. However, in 1995, Kennedy left Cradle of Filth and returned to Daemonum, changing the band's name to Hecate Enthroned and developing a more melodic black metal style and replacing Ian on vocals. Gary was replaced soon after by Andy O'Hara (drums), joining from death metal band Nightmare Visions. Marc and Nigel Dennen remained both as guitarists, with Mark Watson-Jones continuing bass duties.\n\nWith this line-up and in the same year, they recorded their first demo tape, \"An Ode for a Haunted Wood\".\n\nHecate Enthroned toured the UK with Japan's Sigh and Ireland's Primordial in 1995, with long-time bassist Dylan Hughes replacing Mark Watson-Jones on live duties; Hecate Enthroned opened at London Astoria with Ved Buens Ende, Impaled Nazarene and Opeth, gaining firm interest of Blackend Records.\n\nThe \"An Ode for a Haunted Wood\" tape got the attention of British record label Blackend Records, that included Hecate on its roster and re-mastered the tape under the title \"Upon Promeathean Shores (Unscriptured Waters)\", turning it into an EP, also in 1995. Stylistically, this found the band in a more \"true\" black metal sound, with squashed production, growled vocals, raging tempos, blast beats and symphonic arrangements. Prior to its formal release, Steve (Keyboards), Mark Watson-Jones/Dylan (Bass) and Andy O'Hara left the band due to differences with Jon, and were replaced by Craig (Drums), Paul Massey (Bass) and Michael(Keyboards), performing throughout 1996, including the infamous pigs head gig at The Devils Church in London.\n\nIn 1997 Craig was replaced by long-time drummer Robert \"Rob\" Kendrick. In the same year, Hecate released its first full-length album: \"The Slaughter of Innocence, a Requiem for the Mighty\", produced by Andy Sneap, which saw the band enter a faster, more brutal direction, with more emphasis on the symphonic interludes. Although it was very well-received, the band was also very criticised for being considered a \"Cradle of Filth rip-off\", a view that Cradle frontman Dani Filth also shared. As he stated on a 1997 interview:\n\nIn the end of 1997, Paul Massey and Marc left the band, Paul was replaced by Dylan Hughes (who returned to the band after leaving it in 1995) and Marc was replaced by long-time guitarist Andy Milnes; Next year, they released their second full-length, \"Dark Requiems... and Unsilent Massacre\", this time lowering the speed and using the keyboards as the primary instrument and creating more horror-styled atmospheres, though still retaining the brutal heaviness of the first two albums.\n\nA couple of months after the release of \"Dark Requiems...\", due to problems and creative divergences between him and the rest of the band, vocalist Jon Kennedy was fired. Keyboardist Michael also left the band; he was then replaced by Darren \"Daz\" Bishop, and Kennedy was replaced by Dean \"The Serpent\" Seddon. In the following year they recorded their first album with Seddon, \"Kings of Chaos\"; its style changed drastically from that of the previous three releases, heading towards a more death metal-oriented direction, while still retaining the keyboards and dark black metal melodies of the older albums.\n\nIn 2001, Hecate released a small EP of original songs plus a cover of \"Buried Alive\" by Venom, entitled \"Miasma\". In the same year, Dean Seddon guest-starred on Akercocke's album \"The Goat of Mendes\", providing additional vocals for the track \"The Serpent\".\n\nIn 2004, Dean temporarily left the band, and was briefly replaced by Dagon. Keyboardist Daz also left and was replaced by Pete White. However, Dean would return for the recording of their fourth studio album, \"Redimus\". This continues along the sound originally heard on \"Kings of Chaos\", with death metal-style guitars, tempos and growls mixed with symphonic black metal keyboards, melodies and grim screaming. There are also elements of progressive tendencies, as evidenced in the title track and \"Morbeea\", an acoustic track heavily influenced by Spanish flamenco music. Jason Mendonça of Akercocke guest-stars in this album. \"Redimus\" was also the last album by Hecate Enthroned to be released by Blackend; they signed onto a new label, Crank Music Group, in September 2013.\n\n2006 saw Hecate Enthroned embark on a UK headline tour playing in London, Southampton, Nottingham, Bradford and Wolverhampton. 2007 saw them perform in Norway at Inferno Festival alongside Immortal, as well as several shows in Spain, Bulgaria, Romania and Germany. The band was scheduled to do a gig in Bogotá in December 2012, in what would be their first show in South America, but it was cancelled due to inner problems between the band. The show in Bogotá was then rescheduled for 11 July 2015, only to be cancelled again.\n\nOn 10 December 2012, the band announced via their official Facebook page that they fired both vocalist Dean Seddon and drummer Rob Kendrick. Rob was then replaced by Gareth Hardy, and on 14 April 2013 Elliot Beaver was announced as Seddon's replacement.\n\nIn a 21 January 2013 interview with webzine RoarRock, the band announced that a new studio album, tentatively titled \"Virulent Rapture\", was in the works. It was released by Crank Music Group on 25 November 2013. Sarah Jezebel Deva of Angtoria and Cradle of Filth fame guest-stars on \"Virulent Rapture\" providing soprano vocals for a track. A tour around Europe in order to promote the album came afterwards.\n\nIn February 2013, guitarist Nigel Dennen and bassist Dylan Hughes were interviewed for the Hungarian documentary \"Attention! Black Metal!\".\n\nThey announced on their official Facebook on 7 July 2015 that Elliot had parted ways with the band. He was eventually replaced by Joe Stamps in late July.\n\nSince 2014, the band had been preparing for a new album, which was finally released January 25, 2019 by M-Theory Audio and titled \"Embrace of the Godless Aeon\". Thus marks Stamps' first work with the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1835890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835890", "title": "Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation", "text": "Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation\n\nThe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation is a United States reservation in northwestern Nevada, approximately northeast of Reno, in Washoe, Storey, and Lyon counties.\n\nIt is governed by the federally recognized Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, which represents two Northern Paiute bands, the larger Kuyuidökadö (Cui Yui Ticutta) (\"Cui-ui-Fish-Eaters\") and the smaller Tasiget tuviwarai (\"Those who live amidst the mountains\"). The reservation lies almost entirely in Washoe County (99.88%), with small amounts of land in the other two counties (at the southern end, near the city of Fernley).\n\nIn 1993, the population of the reservation was 1,603 individuals. At that time there were 2,253 enrolled members of the tribe. The 2000 census reported a population of 1,734 on the reservation.\n\nTogether with the Walker River Paiute tribe (two Northern Paiute bands: \"Aga'idökadö (Agai Ticutta)\": \"Cutthroat trout Eaters\", and \"Pakwidökadö (Pugwi Ticutta)\": \"Chub carp Eaters\"), in 2016 the Pyramid Lake band successfully sued in federal court in a civil rights case to force the state to provide polling places on the reservation. Otherwise members had to travel many miles to reach a polling place. Early voting at Pyramid Lake reservation started October 22, and during the first two days, the number of voters was double that in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nIn October 2016, under the Nevada Native Nations Land Act, the Pyramid Lake Tribe was one of six federally recognized tribes in Nevada to have additional lands put into trust for their reservations. The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe is to receive approximately of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land. Gaming is prohibited on the new lands.\n\nThe reservation has in land area, and includes all of Pyramid Lake, and all of the Truckee River from the Big Bend north. The reservation is centered on Pyramid Lake, which comprises 25% of the reservation's area. The reservation also includes a sliver of Winnemucca Lake, most of the Lake Range, portions of the Virginia Mountains and Pah Rah Range, and the southern end of the Smoke Creek Desert.\n\nThree communities have developed on the reservation. Wadsworth, the largest, is located near the Big Bend of the Truckee at the southern end of the reservation, just north of the non-reservation town of Fernley. The seat of tribal government is located at Nixon, at the southern end of Pyramid Lake. Sutcliffe is located on the western shore of the lake. A few outlying ranches are located along the Truckee River between Wadsworth and Nixon.\n\nThe reservation land was first set aside for the Northern Paiute by request of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1859. The reservation was not surveyed until 1865. The status of the reservation was very uncertain until President Ulysses S. Grant affirmed its existence by executive order on March 23, 1874. At that time the creation of reservations by the executive branch was novel; most previous reservations were created by treaty or congressional legislation. Subsequent court decisions have affirmed the validity of reservations created by the executive branch, and have set the establishment date for the Pyramid Lake Reservation at 1859, not 1874. This earlier date is important both with regards to the priority date of tribal water rights, and the status of non-tribal claims to land within the reservation.\n\nThe tribe has fought a long series of legal battles on both these issues. The Northern Paiute were awarded a settlement in their lands claim case in 1968.\n\nIn October 2016 the Nevada Native Nations Land Act (PL No: 114-232) authorized the federal government to put certain public lands of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service in the state into trust for six of the nine federally recognized tribes in the state. These transfers will expand their reservations and make their bases more sustainable. The government is putting acres of BLM land into trust for the Pyramid Lake Reservation. Gaming is prohibited on these new lands.\n\nAs of 1970, one source claimed that residents of the reservation included descendants of Chief Winnemucca, an early 19th-century Paiute leader.\n\nThe Lahontan cutthroat trout fishery at Pyramid Lake attracts many anglers from the Reno area and beyond. Sale of fishing licenses and boating permits is a large source of revenue for the tribe. Prior to the construction of Derby Dam and the diversion of water from the Truckee River for irrigation, the lake supported a commercial fishery. This was an even larger revenue source for the tribe.\n\nHistorically water levels have been declining in Pyramid Lake; in addition, water quality has been adversely affected by upstream discharges including point and non–point sources. A number of studies have been conducted on Pyramid Lake including application of the DSSAM hydrological river model to examine nitrogen, reactive phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and other water quality parameters.\n\nNative Americans in Nevada have become more politically active in presidential and other elections, as they have in other states. They have been seeking more equitable access to polling places and treatment by county and state officials.\n\nLed by chairman Vinton Hawley, the Pyramid Lake Paiute joined with the Walker River Paiute in a successful civil rights suit under the Voting Rights Act in federal court against the state government to gain polling places on their homelands in 2016. They have been disadvantaged in the past by having to travel excessive distances to vote in elections, which had reduced participation. They argued that the state had set up satellite offices in wealthy, mostly white neighborhoods. The Justice Department sided with the plaintiffs. When the counties said the change would cost too much and the state said that it could not intervene, the Justice Department \"said in a new filing Monday they appear to be confusing voting rights with 'voting convenience.'\" The court decided in favor of the two Paiute tribes and ordered officials to set up satellite offices. Early voting at Pyramid Lake reservation started October 22, and during the first two days, the number of voters was double the total in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nHawley is chairman of the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada, representing many other tribes that also have difficulty with access to polling places. On behalf of the Council, he has \"urged Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske to direct counties to open [homeland] polling places for nine more tribes, including some where ballot boxes are 200-plus miles away, round trip.\" He also urged the Secretary of State for Nevada to improve conditions at local county polling places for urban Indians, who testified in the suit to being made uncomfortable at most offices.\n\n\n"}

It is produced and distributed by the British-based multinational alcoholic beverage maker Diageo. Since 2007, USA marketing and promotion for CÎROC has been handled by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in an \"equal-share venture\" with profits from the brand being split between promotional partner Diddy and manufacturing partner Diageo.\n\nThe name \"CÎ-ROC\" is a portmanteau of the French word \"cime\", meaning peak or summit-top, and \"roche\", meaning rock, a reference to the high-altitude vineyards of the Gaillac region where the Mauzac grapes are grown (the ”Î” in the CÎROC logo is an i-circumflex letter used in the French language.)\n\nAccording to Diageo, Cîroc is distinguished from other vodkas as it is derived from grapes, rather than using grain, potatoes or corn and cognac. Since it is distilled at 96% and not aged, it fulfills the qualities of a vodka. The production method used for the vodka are \"snap frost\" grapes; Mauzac Blanc from the Gaillac region of France, and Ugni Blanc from the Cognac region. The juice extracted from these grapes is fermented.\n\nAll vodkas are distilled; the manufacturers of Cîroc emphasize its being distilled five times. The first four distillations of the Ugni Blanc take place in stainless steel column stills; the Mauzac Blanc grapes are distilled in copper continuous stills. These are distilled to 96.5% and 93.5%, then blended together; 95% is Ugni Blanc and 5% is Mauzac Blanc. The final distillation is performed in a traditional Armagnac style copper pot still.\n\nCîroc was founded in France by Jean-Sebastien Robicquet, whose family hails from the wine-growing region of Bordeaux. Robicquet, whose family has been in the wine business for 400 years dating back to the 17th century, had studied winemaking in university before moving into spirits instead. Having worked for French cognac-maker Hennessy for ten years, he was approached by the British-based Diageo – which owns a 34% stake in Hennessy – to produce a vodka made from grapes as opposed to grain or potato common among most vodka. Jean-Sebastien Robicquet is recognized as a \"Commander of Bordeaux\" by the Great Council of Bordeaux for his accomplishments in the field of wine/liquor.\n\nInitially launched for the North American market in 2003, NFL football player Earl Little was one of the first American brand ambassadors to promote the beverage. It was introduced to nightclubs and venues throughout the United States, marketed especially in regions such as Atlanta and Miami.\n\nIn 2007, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs agreed to become a brand ambassador for the product struggling to sell 40,000 cases a year. In December 2007, the commercial for Cîroc had Sean Combs calling the drink the \"Official Vodka of New Year's.\" Describing his ambassadorship of the brand, Combs sometimes jokingly refers to himself as \"Cîroc Obama.\" Combs has improved sales; \nThe beverage's parent company Diageo has reported 2.1 million cases sold as of December 2012. Brand Development agency Haines McGregor are responsible for Global research, positioning and identity development for Cîroc. The work included the development of brand guidelines and growth driver tool-kits for all markets.\n\nThe brand introduced two flavored varieties to the market in 2010, Red Berry and Coconut. In 2011, the company added a Peach flavor. In May 2013, CÎROC and Diddy announced that a new flavor would be released called CÎROC Amaretto. \n\nOn 14 December 2011 the company began airing a \"Luck Be a Lady\" advertising campaign for Ultra Premium Vodka, directed by Anthony Mandler. The ads feature a group of elegantly dressed friends (Diddy and Frank Vincent, Eva Pigford, Michael K. Williams, Aaron Paul, Dania Ramirez, Chrissy Teigen, and Jesse Williams) enjoying a festive night on the town.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, Sean Combs announced via his Instagram page that pineapple will be the new flavor of Cîroc. The latest flavor was announced in 2015 in Sean Diddy Combs's Instagram: green apple.\nOn 10 August 2017, Sean Combs announced via his YouTube page that a new flavor of French Vanilla would be produced in partnership with hip-hop artist French Montana.\n"}

He attended the National Military College as a young man, and in 1914 joined the Constitutionalist Army, rising to the rank of . Following the end of the military phase of the Mexican Revolution in 1920, he continued in the military, rising to the rank of brigadier general in 1929 and in 1940 a division general. He saw combat in the Cristero War, the religious conflict that broke out in the late 1920s when President Plutarco Elías Calles began strictly enforcing the anti-clerical laws of the 1917 Mexican Constitution. According to historian Enrique Krauze, Maximino participated in the 1929 mass murder of student supporters of José Vasconcelos, following the 1929 election for president. \n\nHe became the caudillo (strong man) of his home state of Puebla, serving as governor starting in 1937. The strong man of the state of San Luis Potosí, , said of him \"The governor of the state, Major General Maximino Ávila Camacho, was in command in Puebla, I mean in command and not just governing, because he commanded the military, the finance ministry, the telegraphs, the mails, the administration of the railroads, and the diocese [of the Catholic Church in Puebla].\" He amassed a significant personal fortune in land, cattle, and horses as well as making alliances with enormously wealthy foreign businessmen, such as the Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren and U.S. businessman .\n\nRuthless, temperamental and arrogant, Maximino was the opposite of his younger brother, the affable Manuel Ávila Camacho, whose good manners, even temper and diplomatic skills were famous. The President had trouble protecting his brother from himself, Maximino got into fights, seduced women and dispensed public funds at will. His arrogance reached its limits when he proclaimed that he would be the next President because, since his brother had been President he had the right to be his successor, eventually leading to a rift between the two.\n\nIn 1945 the dominant party, founded by Plutarco Elías Calles, renamed the PRI in 1946, would name its presidential candidate, the assured winner of the 1946 elections. Maximino was determined to become the candidate or, at least, have a great influence on the decision. He swore that if the party nominated politician Miguel Alemán Valdés, the son of a Mexican revolutionary but not one himself, Maximino would kill him. Maximino died of a heart attack on February 17, 1945, before the party’s convention. Poor health ran in the family, with his brother Manuel suffering heart attacks while campaigning for the presidency and while in office. However, \"there were some who wondered whether something more than seasoning had been added to [Maximino's] food\" the day he died.

It has deep roots in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, as it was created by a local doctor in the 1890s by mixing Jamaica ginger and sugar with local mineral waters and dispensed as a tonic for dyspepsia.\n\nAs the story goes, in 1781, Patriot James Spears was attempting to run from the British during the Revolutionary War, when his shoe became stuck in the mud of the natural spring; he left it and kept running. Upon his return, he recovered his shoe and noticed the amount of water in the depression his shoe left. He tasted the water and noticed its strong mineral content. Word of the natural spring spread quickly and before long, the area became popular among the wealthy plantation owners and by the late 1800s a small town was established. \n\nIn the late 1890s, Dr. C. R. May began prescribing the mineral springs' water to his patients complaining of stomach troubles. Because his patients frequently complained about the strong iron-like taste of the water, the doctor decided to make the water more palatable by adding Jamaican ginger and sugar. The new concoction's popularity took off and Dr. May partnered with A. J. Matheson to open the Blenheim Bottling Company in 1903. Conveniently located next to the mineral springs, the Blenheim Bottling Company plant was constructed in 1920. Producing as little as 18 to 20 cases a day, the company remained a small, humble operation for 90 years.\n\nIn 1993, Blenheim was bought by the Alan Schafer, who also owned the world-famous South of the Border roadside attraction. Since the original plant was older, Schafer decided that rather than refurbish the building, he would move the bottling operations to a new plant located next to South of the Border.\n\nDespite a marketing push that began in the late 1990s, Blenheim ginger ale is not widely distributed outside the Carolinas; however in more recent years, the company ships to 44 states and three international distributors. The spicy ale has, however, developed a cult following among food and wine aficionados. In February 1998, \"New York Times\" journalist Bill Grimes described the taste this way: \"The first swallow brings on a four-sneeze fit. The second one clears out the sinuses and leaves the tongue and throat throbbing with prickly heat.\"\n\nLuckily for its loyal followers, Blenheim's recipe has not changed in over 110 years and has three varieties to choose from: #3 \"Hot\" (pink cap), #5 \"Not As Hot\" (gold cap) and #9 \"Diet\" (white cap).\n\n\n\n"}

It is possible that he was the composer of one the most famous tunes from medieval England, \"Sumer is icumen in\".\n\nWycombe is variously identified as W de Wyc, Willelmus de Winchecumbe, Willelmo de Winchecumbe or William of Winchcomb. He appeared to have been a secular scribe and precentor employed for about four years at the priory of Leominster in Herefordshire during the 1270s. He is also thought to have been a sub-deacon of the cathedral priory as listed in the Worcester Annals or possibly a monk at St Andrew's in Worcester.\n\nWycombe left a number of documents with his signature, including a collectarium, a precentor's workbook, two rotuli (scrolls) containing music, a summary and treatise on music, a history to which Winchecumbe added music, and also other books. His name also appears in a Reading manuscript including the rota \"Sumer is icumen in\", and on one of seven sets of four-part compositions in the Wintonia collection. Two of these compositions are partially preserved and parts of others are to be found in the Worcester Fragments. Of these compositions, only \"Alleluia, Dies sanctificatus\" is completely restorable. The works have a four-part polyphonic structure. One more fragment is found copied in the Montpellier Codex.\n\nWycombe's main period of activity was probably the 1270s and 1280s. He is best known as the composer of polyphonic alleluias. Over 40 settings have been identified in several sources, a group of compositions almost equal in size to that of Léonin, the earlier composer of the continental Notre Dame school; however only one of the 40 can be restored completely: the others exist only in fragments. Some of his work appears in the Worcester Fragments, a collection of 59 manuscript leaves which represents about a third of the total surviving polyphony from England in the 13th century.\n\nEach of Wycombe's alleluias is in four sections. The second and fourth contain the solo respond and verse sections, while the first and third consist of free polyphony. Stylistically they are similar to the Reading Rota itself (\"Sumer is icumen in\"), emphasizing tonic and supertonic, and showing the English preference for the harmonic interval of the third.\n\n"}

Accommodation ranges from bungalows and medium-priced resorts in East Railay to a collection of luxury resorts focused on West Railay, though one, Rajavadee, spans both waterfronts and also has a beachfront restaurant at Ao Phra Nang. The four main areas of Railay consist of Phra Nang, West Railay, East Railay, and Ton Sai. Ton Sai caters to climbers and the backpacker set and is more rustic in character than the glitz of West Railay and the shops and restaurants of the East Railay boardwalk.\n\nRailay beach was not severely affected by the tsunami of 26 December 2004.\n\nEast Railay Beach is the docking point for boats arriving from Krabi. The East Beach is primarily covered in dense mangroves and is unsuitable for swimming. At the northern end of the waterfront there is a commercial area along a boardwalk/promenade with many restaurants and bars and various services including a muay Thai school, and lower-priced resorts than in West Railay. Above, on the trail that leads to Ton Sai, is the Diamond Cave, which features a walkway into its depths. At the southern end of the boardwalk there is access to a public trail that meanders under overhanging limestone cliffs and provides access to Phra Nang Beach.\n\nWest Railay Beach, connected to the east side by paths through the large resorts or by trails through thin jungle cover, is the primary destination for beach-goers in Railay. The beach is flanked by high limestone cliffs on either side. Long-tail boats are available to hire for transport to Ao Nang, 15 minutes north of Railay. In addition, ferries departing Railay for Ko Phi Phi and points west including Phuket depart from the West beach. The focal point of West Railay Beach is a short promenade (walking street) lined with restaurants and shops.\n\n\nskjera bagera?"}

Lat. IX).\n\nEumenius was born in Gallia Lugdunensis at Augustodunum (modern-day Autun), the \"civitas\" capital of the Celtic Aedui. He was of Greek descent; his grandfather, who had migrated from Athens to Rome, finally settled at Augustodunum as a teacher of rhetoric. Eumenius probably took his father's place, for it was from Augustodunum that he went to be \"magister memoriae\" (private secretary) to the emperor Constantius Chlorus, whom he accompanied on several of his campaigns.\n\nIn 296 CE, Chlorus determined to restore the famous schools (\"scholae Maenianae\") of Augustodunum. During the periodic crises of 3rd-century Gaul, instruction had ceased, possibly for lack of funding or students, and the buildings had been greatly damaged during a siege of the city in 269 CE. The emperor appointed Eumenius to the management of the schools, allowing him to keep the rank of a senior imperial officer and doubling his salary. Eumenius gave up a considerable portion of his emoluments to the improvement of the schools.\n\nEumenius was a pagan and had not converted to Christianity, unlike Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris and other 4th- and 5th-century writers from Gaul.\n\nHis speech, usually called \"Pro restaurandis\" (or \"instaurandis\") \"scholis\" (\"For the restoration of the schools\"), was probably delivered in 297 CE or 298 CE in the forum at Augustodunum or Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon) before the governor of the province. The purpose was to ask the governor if Eumenius might dedicate his salary (or a large part of it) to rebuild the schools at Autun. He praises the emperors (Constantius Chlorus and his colleagues of the tetrarchy) and sets forth the steps necessary to restore the schools to their former state of efficiency, stressing that he intends to assist the good work out of his own pocket. He cites the imperial letter of Constantius granting him his position and salary at length, and it is from the address of this letter that the name of the oration's author is preserved.\n\nFormerly, other anonymous panegyrics of the \"Panegyrici Latini\" were attributed to Eumenius as well. The most extreme position was that of Otto Seeck, who held that all of them were by him. This view has been largely abandoned today, and Eumenius is regarded as the author of only \"Pro instaurandis scholis\".\n\n\n"}

Aged 22, he was appointed professor at Catanzaro , and married Raffaela Luigia Faucitano (1835). While still a young man he had been affected by the wave of liberalism then spreading all over Italy, and soon after his marriage he began to conspire mildly against the Bourbon government.\n\nBetrayed by a priest, he was arrested in 1839 and imprisoned at Naples; although liberated three years later he lost his professorship and had to maintain himself by private lessons. Nevertheless, he continued to conspire, and in 1847 he published anonymously the \"Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies\", a scathing indictment of the Bourbon government.\n\nOn the advice of friends he went to Malta on a British warship, but although, when King Ferdinand II granted a constitution (February 16, 1848), he returned to Naples and was given an appointment at the ministry of education, he soon resigned on account of the prevailing chaos, and retired to a farm at Posillipo.\n\nWhen reaction set in, once more Settembrini was arrested as a suspect (June 1849) and imprisoned. After trial, he and two other \"politicals\" were condemned to death, and nineteen others to varying terms of imprisonment (February 1851). The death sentences were, however, commuted to imprisonment for life, and Settembrini was sent to the dungeons of Santo Stefano. There he remained for eight years. His friends, including Antonio Panizzi, then in England, made various unsuccessful attempts to liberate him, and at last he was deported with sixty-five other political prisoners.\n\nThe exiles received an enthusiastic welcome in London, but Settembrini after a short stay in England joined his family at Florence in 1860.\n\nOn the formation of the Italian kingdom he was appointed professor of Italian literature at the university of Naples, and devoted the rest of his life to literary pursuits. In 1875, he was nominated senator.\n\nHis chief work is his \"Lezioni di letteratura italiana\", of which the dominant note is the conviction that Italian literature \"is as the very soul of the nation, seeking, in opposition to medieval mysticism, reality, freedom, independence of reason, truth and beauty\" (P. Villari).\n\nSettembrini's homosexuality was first mentioned in 1977, the year of the publication of The Neoplatonics, a homoerotic fantasy written while in prison soon after completing his translation of Lucian (1858 - 1859). Left among his papers at his death, the manuscript was afterwards read by Benedetto Croce, who advised against publication.\n"}

In 1159 he joined the obedience of Victor IV and organized synods in England and France in favor of the antipope. Pope Alexander III interdicted him. In 1164, Victor IV died. A small number of cardinals, who had been obedient to Victor IV, met again in Lucca to elect a successor. Guido was elected as the successor, took the name Paschal III and was consecrated by Henry II of Leez, Bishop of Liège. The new pope was established at Viterbo and successfully prevented Alexander from reaching Rome. However, he was soon driven from Rome, leading to the return of Alexander III in 1165.\n\nIn order to gain more support from Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Paschal canonized Charlemagne in a magnificent celebration at Aachen in 1165. Paschal soon lost the support of Burgundy, but the emperor crushed opposition in Germany, and gained the cooperation of Henry II of England.\n\nConcerned over rumours that Alexander III was about to enter into an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I, in October 1166 Frederick embarked on his fourth Italian campaign, hoping as well to secure the claim of Paschal III and the imperial coronation of his wife, Beatrice. In 1167 Frederick began besieging Ancona, which had acknowledged the authority of Manuel I. Meanwhile, his forces achieved a great victory over the Romans at the Battle of Monte Porzio. Heartened by this victory, Frederick lifted the siege of Ancona and hurried to Rome. Supported by Frederick's imperial army, Paschal was enthroned at St Peter's on 22 July 1167, and Alexander III became a fugitive. On the following 30 July, Frederick received a second coronation from Paschal III. Two days later, Paschal crowned Beatrice empress. Unfortunately, Frederick's campaign was halted by the sudden outbreak of an epidemic (malaria or the plague), which threatened to destroy the Imperial army and drove the emperor back to Germany, Without the support of the Emperor, Paschal was able to hold so much as the quarter on the right bank of the Tiber, where he died of cancer on the 20 September 1168. He was succeeded by Antipope Callixtus III.\n\nThe Catholic Church has never recognized Charlemagne's canonization, since Paschal was an antipope. In 1179, the Third Council of the Lateran annulled all of his ordinances, including the canonisation. Charlemagne remained in good regard still, however, among Catholics, and Prosper Guéranger even composed a prayer to Charlemagne. He is a Blessed of the Church.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1836020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836020", "title": "Laser ablation", "text": "Laser ablation\n\nLaser ablation or photoablation is the process of removing material from a solid (or occasionally liquid) surface by irradiating it with a laser beam. At low laser flux, the material is heated by the absorbed laser energy and evaporates or sublimates. At high laser flux, the material is typically converted to a plasma. Usually, laser ablation refers to removing material with a pulsed laser, but it is possible to ablate material with a continuous wave laser beam if the laser intensity is high enough. Excimer lasers of deep ultra-violet light are mainly used in photoablation; the wavelength of laser used in photoablation is approximately 200 nm.\n\nThe depth over which the laser energy is absorbed, and thus the amount of material removed by a single laser pulse, depends on the material's optical properties and the laser wavelength and pulse length. The total mass ablated from the target per laser pulse is usually referred to as ablation rate. Such features of laser radiation as laser beam scanning velocity and the covering of scanning lines can significantly influence the ablation process.\n\nLaser pulses can vary over a very wide range of duration (milliseconds to femtoseconds) and fluxes, and can be precisely controlled. This makes laser ablation very valuable for both research and industrial applications.\n\nThe simplest application of laser ablation is to remove material from a solid surface in a controlled fashion. Laser machining and particularly laser drilling are examples; pulsed lasers can drill extremely small, deep holes through very hard materials. Very short laser pulses remove material so quickly that the surrounding material absorbs very little heat, so laser drilling can be done on delicate or heat-sensitive materials, including tooth enamel (laser dentistry). Several workers have employed laser ablation and gas condensation to produce nano particles of metal, metal oxides and metal carbides.\n\nAlso, laser energy can be selectively absorbed by coatings, particularly on metal, so CO or pulsed lasers can be used to clean surfaces, remove paint or coating, or prepare surfaces for painting without damaging the underlying surface. High power lasers clean a large spot with a single pulse. Lower power lasers use many small pulses which may be scanned across an area. In industrial application, laser ablation is known as laser cleaning.\n\nOne of the advantages is that no solvents are used, therefore it is environmentally friendly and operators are not exposed to chemicals (assuming nothing harmful is vaporized). It is relatively easy to automate. The running costs are lower than dry media or dry-ice blasting, although the capital investment costs are much higher. The process is gentler than abrasive techniques, e.g. carbon fibres within a composite material are not damaged. Heating of the target is minimal.\n\nAnother class of applications uses laser ablation to process the material removed into new forms either not possible or difficult to produce by other means. A recent example is the production of carbon nanotubes.\n\nLaser cleaning is also used for efficient rust removal from iron objects; oil or grease removal from various surfaces; restoration of paintings, sculptures, frescoes. Laser ablation is one of preferred techniques for rubber mold cleaning due to minimal surface damage to the mold.\n\nIn March 1995 Guo et al. were the first to report the use of a laser to ablate a block of pure graphite, and later graphite mixed with catalytic metal. The catalytic metal can consist of elements such as cobalt, niobium, platinum, nickel, copper, or a binary combination thereof. The composite block is formed by making a paste of graphite powder, carbon cement, and the metal. The paste is next placed in a cylindrical mold and baked for several hours. After solidification, the graphite block is placed inside an oven with a laser pointed at it, and argon gas is pumped along the direction of the laser point. The oven temperature is approximately 1200 °C. As the laser ablates the target, carbon nanotubes form and are carried by the gas flow onto a cool copper collector. Like carbon nanotubes formed using the electric-arc discharge technique, carbon nanotube fibers are deposited in a haphazard and tangled fashion. Single-walled nanotubes are formed from the block of graphite and metal catalyst particles, whereas multi-walled nanotubes form from the pure graphite starting material.\n\nA variation of this type of application is to use laser ablation to create coatings by ablating the coating material from a source and letting it deposit on the surface to be coated; this is a special type of physical vapor deposition called pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and can create coatings from materials that cannot readily be evaporated any other way. This process is used to manufacture some types of high temperature superconductor and laser crystals.\n\nRemote laser spectroscopy uses laser ablation to create a plasma from the surface material; the composition of the surface can be determined by analyzing the wavelengths of light emitted by the plasma.\n\nLaser ablation is also used to create pattern, removing selectively coating from dichroic filter. This products are used in stage lighting for high dimensional projections, or for calibration of machine vision's instruments.\n\nFinally, laser ablation can be used to transfer momentum to a surface, since the ablated material applies a pulse of high pressure to the surface underneath it as it expands. The effect is similar to hitting the surface with a hammer. This process is used in industry to work-harden metal surfaces, and is one damage mechanism for a laser weapon. It is also the basis of pulsed laser propulsion for spacecraft.\n\nThe laser ablation of skin utilizes laser energy so CO2 or Nd:YAG pulsed lasers can be used to clean surfaces, remove pigmentation or improve but not cure the appearance of scar tissue, and resurface outer layers of skin without damaging the underlying surface. \n\nProcesses are currently being developed to use laser ablation in the removal of thermal barrier coating on high-pressure gas turbine components. Due to the low heat input, TBC removal can be completed with minimal damage to the underlying metallic coatings and parent material.\n\nLaser ablation is used as a sampling method for elemental and isotopic analysis, and replaces traditional laborious procedures generally required for digesting solid samples in acid solutions. Laser ablation sampling is detected by monitoring the photons emitted at the sample surface - a technology referred to as LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) and LAMIS (Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry), or by transporting the ablated mass particles to a secondary excitation source, like the inductively coupled plasma. Both mass spectroscopy (MS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) can be coupled with the ICP. The benefits of laser ablation sampling for chemical analysis include no sample preparation, no waste, minimal sample requirements, no vacuum requirements, rapid sample-analysis turn-around time, spatial (depth and lateral) resolution, and chemical mapping. Laser ablation chemical analysis is viable for practically all industries, such as mining, geochemistry, energy, environmental, industrial processing, food safety, forensic and biological. Commercial instruments are available for all markets to measure every element and isotope within a sample. Some instruments combine both optical and mass detection to extend the analysis coverage, and dynamic range in sensitivity. \n\nLaser ablation is used in science to destroy nerves and other tissues to study their function. For example, a species of pond snail, \"Helisoma trivolvis\", can have their sensory neurons laser ablated off when the snail is still an embryo to prevent use of those nerves.\n\nAnother example is the trochophore larva of \"Platynereis dumerilii\", where the larval eye was ablated and the larvae was not phototactic, anymore. However phototaxis in the nectochaete larva of \"Platynereis dumerilii\" is not mediated by the larval eyes, because the larva is still phototactic, even if the larval eyes are ablated. But if the adult eyes are ablated, then the nectochaete is not phototactic anymore and thus phototaxis in the nectochaete larva is mediated by the adult eyes.\n\nLaser ablation can also be used to destroy individual cells during embryogenesis of an organism, like \"Platynereis dumerilii\", to study the effect of missing cells during development.\n\nThere are several laser types used in medicine for ablation, including argon, carbon dioxide (CO), dye, , excimer, , and others. Laser ablation is used in a variety of medical specialties including ophthalmology, general surgery, neurosurgery, ENT, dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and veterinary. Laser scalpels are used for ablation in both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries. Some of the most common procedures where laser ablation is used include LASIK, skin resurfacing, cavity preparation, biopsies, and tumor and lesion removal. In soft-tissue surgeries, the CO laser beam ablates and cauterizes simultaneously, making it the most practical and most common soft-tissue laser.\n\nLaser ablation can be used on benign and malignant lesions in various organs, which is called laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy. The main applications currently involve the reduction of benign thyroid nodules and destruction of primary and secondary malignant liver lesions.\n\nLaser ablation is also used to treat chronic venous insufficiency.\n\n\n"}

It retained all five seats in the 1954 elections, and increased their majority to seven of the eight seats in 1957 and nine of the ten seats in 1961.\n\nIn 1964 the party lost an election for the first time, with the United Workers Party, born out of a schism from within the Labour Party led by John Compton and eventual merger of the breakaway faction with the People's Progressive Party, winning six of the ten seats, with the Labour Party reduced to two. It gained a seat in the 1969 elections, and increased their representation to seven seats in 1974, although the UWP remained in power as the total number of seats rose to 17.\n\nThe Labour Party returned to power after winning the Saint Lucian general election, 1979 (12/17), led by Allan Louisy, replaced as Prime Minister during the term by Winston Cenac, himself replaced by Michael Pilgrim. The 1979 elections were the first elections held following independence from the United Kingdom, declared on 22 February 1979.\n\nIt lost the 1982 elections to Compton's UWP when they were reduced to just two seats, challenged on their left by a breakaway faction, George Odlum's Progressive Labour Party taking 1 seat. It remained in opposition following the two elections of April 1987, increasing its presence to 8 seats in both contests, and in 1992 (6/17).\n\nLed by Dr. Kenny Anthony, former cabinet minister in the 1979-1982 government, it won the 1997 elections, taking 16 of the 17 seats. It remained in power after the 2001 elections (14/17).\n\nIt lost the 2006 elections to the UWP, who had called back John Compton as leader a year before - he had retired in 1996. Kenny Anthony remained leader of the party throughout its time as loyal opposition. The Labour Party won the Saint Lucian general election, 2011 (28 November 2011), winning in 11 out of a 17-seats contest and defeating UWP leader Stephenson King who had succeeded John Compton as Prime Minister (D. 2007, in office).\n\nThe Labour Party lost the 2016 elections to the UWP by 11 seats to 6, and Kenny Anthony resigned as party leader. Former Deputy PM Philip J. Pierre was confirmed as party leader on 18 June 2016.\n\n"}

It was released on April 26, 2005, by Richcraft Records, Sony Urban Music, and Columbia Records. Following the release of her debut album, \"All I Have\" (2002), and her first acting role (in the 2004 film \"First Daughter\"), Amerie began work on her second studio album. As with \"All I Have\", the album was co-written and produced by mentor Rich Harrison, with contributions from additional productions. Unlike her debut, Amerie co-wrote every track but one, and assumed more creative control over the visual imagery accompanying the album, such as music videos and artwork.\n\n\"Touch\" is an R&B album with a diverse musical style, marking a transition from Amerie's neo-soul debut. Its songs feature pulses, funky percussion, pumping energy, go-go beats with an organic core built around horns and electric pianos. Upon release, \"Touch\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Amerie's vocals and Harrison's production. The album received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Award nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards including Best Contemporary R&B Album.\n\nCommercially, the album debuted at number five on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 124,000 copies and was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold over 500,000 copies in the United States. The album also fared well elsewhere peaking within the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart. The album spawned three singles, including the lead single \"1 Thing\" which became Amerie's most commercially successful song to date, peaking at number eight on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was followed by the release of the less successful singles \"Touch\" and \"Talkin' About\".\n\nFollowing Amerie's meeting with producer Rich Harrison and signing to a record deal with Harrison's Richcraft Entertainment, in partnership with Columbia Records, she released her debut album. Amerie's debut album, \"All I Have\", was released in July 2002 to generally positive reviews. It debuted at number nine on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 89,000 copies in its first week of release; the album has since been certified hold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and had sold 657,000 copies as of June 2008, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In 2004, Amerie earned her first acting role, portraying the role of Mia Thompson, a college student who rooms with the president's daughter, in the film \"First Daughter\", alongside actress Katie Holmes. Shortly after her acting debut, Amerie began work on her second studio album.\n\nAmerie began work on the album in early 2004. As with \"All I Have\", the album was co-written and produced by mentor Harrison, who contributed seven (new) tracks to the record; additional productions came from Lil Jon, Bryce Wilson, Red Spyda, and Dre & Vidal. Unlike on her first album, Amerie co-wrote every track but one, \"Come with Me\", which Harrison wrote. She also assumed more creative control over the visual imagery accompanying the album, such as videos and artwork—\"I feel like when you do a record, you have a vision in your mind and you want to carry it across—and it doesn't end with the studio\", she has said.\n\nIn 2004, when working on her second album, Amerie enlisted the services of Harrison, who had helped produce and write her first album. In May 2004, Harrison heard \"Oh, Calcutta!\" for the first time and began working on the beat accompanying the ten-second back-and-forth breakdown between Meters drummer Ziggy Modeliste and guitarist Leo Nocentelli. Harrison said he loved the work of the Meters, especially Modeliste, commenting, \"Ziggy, he's crazy.\" He processed the way the breakdown could be \"flipped\", added a bongo drum, a cowbell, and a ride cymbal, and sent it to Amerie. According to Harrison, they wrote and finished the song in two to three hours.\n\nAmerie's manager, Len Nicholson, felt the song was \"the single\" to release. When executives at Amerie's label, Columbia/Sony Urban Music, heard \"1 Thing\", they felt that the song's choruses needed to be \"bigger\". They recommended that more music be added to the percussion-focused beat, but Harrison and Amerie replied that adding more to the beat would overpower the song. Harrison and Amerie returned to the studio several times to rework the track. Each time they submitted a new version to the label, Columbia told them that the song sounded unfinished, but was unable to specify what should be changed. The label continued to refuse to release \"1 Thing\"; in Amerie's words, \"People just weren't getting it\".\n\n\"Touch\" is an R&B album, which musically differs from Amerie's neo-soul debut. \"Touch\" is built over \"pulses with funky percussion, pumping sexy energy\" and incorporates elements of go-go beats. Janet Tzou from \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the album's musical style as being \"revitalizing R&B\" that differs from other contemporary R&B artists. The album's production is characterised as having an \"organic core\" and \"loose-limbed swagger\", which relies heavily on sampled horn screams and weeping electric pianos with all the songs having a \"glossy, processed sheen.\"\n\nThe album's title track was produced by Lil Jon and is a dance and crunk&B track that experiments with Latin influences.\n\nSix months after recording \"1 Thing\", Amerie and Harrison leaked it to American radio stations in an attempt to get it released officially. The response from DJs and listeners was positive, and it consequently received airplay across the country. Columbia Records attempted to suppress the song because it was an unofficial release, and because Amerie's labelmate Jennifer Lopez had expressed interest in recording the song for her own album, \"Rebirth\". Radio stations refused to retract the song from their playlists, and Columbia eventually began promoting \"1 Thing\" as a single, making it a last-minute addition to the soundtrack to the film \"Hitch\". The song became Amerie's best-performing single to date. In the United States, it peaked at number eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The RIAA awarded a gold certification for digital sales in October 2005, and another gold certification for ringtone sales in June 2006. Internationally, the single peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and attained top-10 and top-20 positions across continental Europe.\n\nThe album's title track \"Touch\" was released as the album's second single and peaked at number 95 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States, while reaching number 19 on the UK chart. \"Talkin' About\" was released as the album's third and final single. According to Amerie, it is one of her \"really personal\" songs and one of her favorite tracks on the album. Released as a promotional single, \"Talkin' About\" peaked at number two on \"Billboard\"s Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. A remix was made featuring rapper Jadakiss. It was the third single from the album and Amerie told MTV News in August 2005 that she would be co-directing the music video with Chris Robinson, with whom she collaborated on the videos for the two previous singles. The video, however, was not filmed.\n\n\"Touch\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 12 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that \"Touch\" is an improvement over \"All I Have\" because of better written songs and consistent production, which is accessible to listeners of different ages. Tom Breihan of \"Pitchfork\" felt that Harrison makes the most out of Amerie's \"thin, reedy\" voice, which he found more sophisticated than singers such as Nivea or Ashanti. Ben Sisario of \"Blender\" magazine wrote that \"Amerie's heat is irresistible, in large part because it's subtle.\" \"Vibe\" magazine's Angie Romero complimented her emotional singing, but was most impressed by her songs with Harrison: \"Their exquisite blend of the delicate and the demonstrative proves that, whether it's hard or soft, love is love.\" Bill Werde of \"Rolling Stone\" observed some ordinary R&B songs on what is otherwise a more mature album by Amerie.\n\nIn a less enthusiastic review, \"Stylus Magazine\"s Al Shipley was disappointed that Harrison did not produce the rest of \"Touch\", which he felt would have made it more consistent. Both \"Uncut\" magazine and Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" said that none of the album's other songs are as impressive as \"1 Thing\"; Sanneh called it one of the year's best singles. Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" singled out \"1 Thing\" and the title track as \"choice cuts\", which indicates good songs on an otherwise bad album. He referred to \"1 Thing\" as \"a machine-gun one-shot on an album with its safety engaged\" in his accompanying essay for the Pazz & Jop critics poll, in which the song had been voted the third best single of 2005.\n\n\"Touch\" debuted at number five on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 124,000 copies in its first week of release. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in August 2005, and by June 2009, it had sold 406,000 copies in the United States. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 32 before peaking at number 28; it spent a total of six weeks on the chart. Elsewhere, \"Touch\" reached number 57 in Australia, number 59 in France, number 70 the Netherlands, number 83 in Switzerland, number 91 in Germany and number 93 in Belgium.\n\nNotes\n\nSample credits\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Touch\".\n\n\n"}

This usage also spread to other Eastern bloc countries under Soviet Warsaw pact domination, such as East Germany, where the Berlin Wall was known as the \"Anti-Fascist Protection Wall\". The term \"anti-fascist\" became ubiquitous in the Eastern bloc, where it became synonymous with the communist party line and denoted the struggle against dissenters and against the broader Western world.\n\nThe Bolshevik movement and later the Soviet Union made frequent use of the \"fascist\" epithet coming from its conflict with the early German and Italian fascist movements. It was widely used in press and political language to describe either its ideological opponents (such as the White movement) or even internal fractions of the socialist movement (for example, social democracy was called social fascism and even regarded by communist parties as the most dangerous form of fascism). In Germany, the Communist Party of Germany which had been largely controlled by the Soviet leadership since 1928 used the epithet \"fascism\" to describe both the social democrats and the Nazi movement; in Soviet usage the German Nazis were described as \"fascists\" until 1939, when the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed, after which Nazi–Soviet relations started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda. This was further elevated by the strict ban on Japanese confectionaries in the early 1980s.\nAfter the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, \"fascist\" was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism–Leninism, fascism was the \"final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie\", which \"in fascism sought refuge\" from \"inherent contradictions of capitalism\". As a result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was \"fascist\", with the Third Reich being just the \"most reactionary\" one. For example, the international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as \"fascist libel\" and the Warsaw Uprising as \"illegal and organised by fascists\". Communist Służba Bezpieczeństwa described Trotskyism, Titoism and imperialism as \"variants of fascism\".\n\nThis use continued into the Cold War era and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Soviet-backed German Democratic Republic's official name for the Berlin Wall was the \"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\" (). During the Barricades in January 1991, which followed the May 1990 declared restoration of independence of Republic of Latvia from the Soviet Union, the Communist Party declared that \"fascism was reborn in Latvia.\"\n\nIn January 2014, during the Euromaidan demonstrations, the \"Slavic Anti-fascist Front\" was created in Crimea by Russian MP Aleksey Zhuravlyov and Crimean Russian Unity party leader (and future Head of the Republic of Crimea) Sergey Aksyonov to oppose \"fascist uprising\" in Ukraine. After the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution, through the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the outbreak of the war in Donbass, Russian nationalists and media used the term. They frequently described the Ukrainian government after Euromaidan as \"fascist\" or \"Nazi\", at the same time accusing them of \"Jewish influence\" or spreading \"gay propaganda\".\n\nIn 1944, the acclaimed English writer George Orwell had this to say about the term's overuse as an epithet:\n\nIn the 1980s, the term was used by leftist critics to describe the Reagan administration. The term was later used in the 2000s to describe the administration of George W. Bush by its critics and in the late 2010s to describe the candidacy and administration of Donald Trump. In her 1970 book \"Beyond Mere Obedience\", radical activist and theologian Dorothee Sölle coined the term \"Christofascist\" to describe fundamentalist Christians.\n\nIn 2004, Samantha Power (lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University) reflected Orwell's words from 60 years prior when she stated: \"Fascism – unlike communism, socialism, capitalism, or conservatism – is a smear word more often used to brand one's foes than it is a descriptor used to shed light on them\".\n\nIn 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found contrary to the Article 10 (freedom of expression) of ECHR fining a journalist for calling a right-wing journalist \"local neo-fascist\", regarding the statement as a value-judgment acceptable in the circumstances.\n\nIn response to multiple authors claiming that the then-presidential candidate Donald Trump was a \"fascist\", a 2016 article for Vox cited five historians who study fascism—including Roger Griffin, author of \"The Nature of Fascism\"—who stated that Trump either does not hold and even is opposed to several political viewpoints that are integral to fascism, including viewing violence as an inherent good and an inherent rejection of or opposition to a democratic system.\n\nSeveral Marxist theories back up particular uses of fascism beyond its usual remit. For instance, Nicos Poulantzas's theory of state monopoly capitalism could be associated with the idea of a military-industrial complex to suggest that 1960s America had a fascist social structure, though this kind of Maoist or Guevarist analysis often underpinned the rhetorical depiction of Cold War authoritarians as fascists.\n\nSome Marxist groups, such as the Indian section of the Fourth International and the Hekmatist groups in Iran and Iraq, have provided analytical accounts as to why the term \"fascist\" should be applied to groups such as the Hindutva movement, the 1979 Islamic Iranian regime or the Islamist sections of the Iraqi insurgency. Other scholars contend that the traditional meaning of the term \"fascism\" does not apply to Hindutva groups and may hinder an analysis of their activities.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for the instrumental \"A Fifth of Beethoven\", a disco adaptation of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony which topped the charts in 1976 and was featured on the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack in 1977. Further classical–disco fusions followed, such as \"Flight '76\", \"Rhapsody in Blue\", \"Toccata and Funk in 'D' Minor\", \"Bolero\", and \"Mostly Mozart\", but were not as successful.\n\nIn a career spanning nearly five decades, Murphy has written music for numerous films and TV shows, including \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", \"The Savage Bees\", \"Stingray\", \"Wiseguy\", \"The Commish\", \"Profit\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Looney Tunes\", and \"How Murray Saved Christmas\". He has had a long-running partnership with Seth MacFarlane, composing music for his films and TV shows such as \"Family Guy\", \"The Cleveland Show\", \"American Dad!\", \"Ted\", and \"Ted 2\".\n\nMurphy was born on December 19, 1952, in New York City, and grew up in Manhattan. At age four, he attended music lessons hosted by Rosa Rio, studying an array of instruments, including the organ and piano. Rio frequently opted for him to star in television advertisements for the Hammond organ.\n\nAgainst the wishes of his father, who was a real estate agent and wished to pass down his business to his son, Murphy enrolled in the Manhattan School of Music in 1970; recalling his experiences with his father, Murphy stated \"He wanted me to be a doctor or lawyer—or something you can depend on.\" There, Murphy studied jazz and classical piano; referring to his studies, he stated \"There never was a time when I wasn't studying music.\" In 1972, he married Laurie Robertson, who worked in the plastics industry.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Murphy was the leader of a band called WAM, which played R&B and soul covers. They gigged in the New York tri-state area, often at the New Rochelle club Pearly's.\n\nIn college, Murphy's interests included rock music, particularly that which was adapted from classical music, such as \"Joy\" by Apollo 100 and \"A Lover's Concerto\" by The Toys. Later, in 1976, he was writing a disco song for a commercial, when a producer gave him the idea of \"updating classical music,\" which \"nobody had done lately.\" He then recorded a demo tape of four songs—three were ordinary pop songs, while the fourth was a disco rendition of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony titled \"A Fifth of Beethoven—and mailed it to various record labels in New York City. Response was generally unimpressive, but \"Fifth\" caught the interest of Private Stock Records owner Larry Uttal.\n\nMurphy signed on to Private Stock and recorded the album \"A Fifth of Beethoven\". The first single and title track, \"A Fifth of Beethoven\", was released on May 29, 1976. It was a hit, starting out at number 80 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and eventually reaching number 1 within 19 weeks, where it stayed for one week. The single sold two million copies, while the album sold about 750,000 copies. The second single, a rendition of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" titled \"Flight '76\", was less successful, reaching only number 44 on the Hot 100.\n\nThe record was credited to \"Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band\" upon encouragement from Private Stock, who believed it would become a hit if credited to a group rather than an individual. However, two days following the record's release, Private Stock discovered the existence of another Big Apple Band (which promptly changed its name to Chic); the record was later re-released and credited to \"The Walter Murphy Band\", then just \"Walter Murphy\".\n\nFollowing the success of \"A Fifth of Beethoven\", Murphy toured with his band and made guest appearances on shows such as \"Don Kirshner's Rock Concert\", \"The Midnight Special\", \"Dinah!\", and \"American Bandstand\". In addition, as a result of the single's success, Murphy and his wife were able to move out of their two-room apartment in Yonkers and into a rented ranch house in the same Westchester neighborhood. On the success of the single, he said: \"It's really sad that the kids today can only relate to Beethoven via a rock version of his music.\" He hoped \"that maybe if they've heard this much of his symphony, they'll go out and buy the original.\"\n\nIn 1977, \"A Fifth of Beethoven\" was licensed to RSO Records for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film \"Saturday Night Fever\", giving it a new lease on life. Also that year, Murphy recorded the album \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which contained a similar mix of classical-disco fusion and self-penned pop songs. Two singles were released: a disco treatment of George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", and the self-penned instrumental \"Uptown Serenade.\" The former narrowly missed the top 100, but received significant play on easy-listening stations, according to \"Billboard\".\n\nIn 1978, Murphy recorded the album \"Phantom of the Opera\", a concept album telling the story of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", featuring Gene Pistilli as Erik/The Phantom, B.G. Gibson as Raoul, and Renée Geyer as Christine. The album spawned three singles: \"Dance Your Face Off\"/\"Gentle Explosion\" (a double A-side), \"Toccata and Funk in 'D' Minor\", and \"The Music Will Not End\". The latter was a Top 40 hit, but the former failed to make the club or radio charts.\n\nMurphy signed on to RCA in 1979, and released the album \"Walter Murphy's Discosymphony\". The album spawned the singles \"Bolero\" and \"Mostly Mozart\"; the latter failed to chart, indicating that Murphy had taken the \"classical disco\" concept as far as it could go.\n\nAlso in 1979, Murphy joined with brothers Eddie and Frank Dillard, forming the band Uncle Louie. They signed on to TK Records and released one album, \"Uncle Louie's Here\", which explored a more aggressive, funk-based angle than Murphy's solo albums. The album spawned three singles: \"Full-Tilt Boogie\", which reached number 19 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart, \"I Like Funky Music\", and \"Sky High\".\n\nIn 1982, Murphy signed on to MCA Records and recorded \"Themes from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and More\". The album contained disco and pop-tinged arrangements of themes to popular movies of the time, such as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", \"Indiana Jones\", and \"Poltergeist\". The album spawned one single, a medley of \"Themes from ET (The Extra-Terrestrial)\", which climbed to number 47 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nDuring an appointment with Bobby Rosengarden, bandleader of the \"Dick Cavett Show\" orchestra, Murphy convinced the group to play some of his arrangements when he found Rosengarden to be absent. Looking back on the situation, he stated \"I still can't believe I did it. I'm not a very forward person.\" Since the band \"wasn't very busy,\" they performed his arrangements live and enjoyed them, convincing Murphy to write more.\n\nIn April 1972, a fellow student from the Manhattan School of Music introduced Murphy to Doc Severinsen, musical director of \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". Murphy presented his arrangements to Severinsen, who liked them enough to have \"The Tonight Show Band\" play them live. However, \"The Tonight Show\" moved production to Burbank, California a month later, and a final year of college prevented Murphy from joining them.\n\nIn 1974, Murphy joined Thomas J. Valentino's company Valentino, Inc., composing much of their library music for film and television over the years.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1980, Murphy worked as a Manhattan Avenue jingle writer, writing for such clients as Lady Arrow shirts, Revlon, Woolworth's, Viasa Airlines, and Korvette's, as well as arrangements for the popular television series \"Big Blue Marble\".\n\nIn 1985, Murphy collaborated with Rick James, Issac Hayes, and Mike Post on scoring music for \"The A-Team\" episode \"The Heart of Rock 'N Roll\".\n\nSince 1999, Murphy has served as one of the two main composers for the animated series \"Family Guy\", the other being Ron Jones until the 12th season in 2014. He has described his scores for \"Family Guy\" as \"a combination of [big-band swing and action-orchestral].\" The song \"You've Got a Lot to See\", composed for the episode \"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\", won the award for Outstanding Music and Lyrics at the 2002 Emmy Awards. In 2005, Murphy scored music for the offshoot album \"\".\n\nSince 2005, Murphy is one of the composers for MacFarlane's \"American Dad!\", the other two being Joel McNeely and Ron Jones, as well as composing the series' theme song \"Good Morning USA\".\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Murphy composed music for MacFarlane's short-lived series \"The Cleveland Show\", including the main title theme.\n\nIn 2012, Murphy scored MacFarlane's film \"Ted\", and received an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination for co-writing \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\" with MacFarlane.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A conscript of the Devshirme system, he became a Pasha. Ballaban Badera was said to be the first climbing the walls of Constantinople. He held a position of sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid in 1464 and 1465.\n\nBallaban Badera was born in Mat, Albania as a Catholic with the name Michael, the son of Milosh and Helena. Conscripted through the Devshirme system he rose to the rank of Pasha in the Ottoman Army under Sultan Mehmed II.\n\nBallaban fought Skanderbeg in April 1465 close to Ohrid. The Albanians were victorious, but many officers were captured, including Moisi Arianit Golemi of Dibra. They were sent to Constantinople, where they were executed in Istanbul for treason.\n\nMilosh had served in the army of the Wallachian Prince Mircea I, fighting against the Ottoman Turks. Michael, son of Milosh and Helena, was kidnaped during the Ottoman Turkish raids. Ballaban Badera's mother, Helena, was killed during the Turkish raids Milosh, father of Ballaban Badera, and brother Constantine escaped and survived the raids. Michael was raised as a Janissary and named Ballaban Badera, or Ballaban Pasha; he was a product of the Devshirme system, just as the entire troop of Janissaries was, and one of the best generals of the Ottoman Army under Sultan Mehmed II. George Kastriota (Skanderbeg), with whom Ballaban Badera would cross paths of history, was raised as a Janissary as well, under the same Devshirme system Ballaban Badera was developed.\n\nBallaban fought George Kastriota (Skanderbeg) in April 1465 close to Ohrid. The Albanians were victorious, but at a terrible cost: Ballaban Pasha showed his military prowess and thirteen highest ranking generals of George Kastriota were captured; among them was Moisi Arianit Golemi of Dibra, George Kastriota's, (Skanderbeg's), second in command. Moisi Arianit Golemi was the organizer of Skanderbeg's desertion from the Ottoman Court and subsequent return to Albania. Moisi Golemi was also the main political organizer and the heart and soul, if you will, of the Albanian Cause. Moisi Arianit Golemi, two of George Kastriota's nephews, and the other captured generals were sent to Constantinople, modern day Istanbul. George Kastriota offered great many captured Ottoman Pashas and great many Ottoman Prisoners, and enormous amounts of treasure in exchange for Moisi Golemi and the other generals, but Mehmet II refused: Moisi Golemi and the other captured Albanian Generals were all an invaluable prize to the Ottomans. Ballaban Badera had dealt a terrible blow to the Albanian resistance by capturing Moisi Golemi and high ranking George Kastriota's generals, and the effect of that terrible blow was to be felt with time, after the death of George Kastriota.\n\nAs usual, Mehmet II made attempts to win alliances of the captured Albanian Generals against George Kastriota, but such attempts failed. Moisi Arianit Golemi was not presented with such an offer: He had previously approached the Sultan, had betrayed Skanderbeg, and had led an Ottoman Army against George Kastriota. In doing so, Moisi Golemi had hoped to save his people, and his country of Albania, from the utter devastation and the disastrous burden of the war against the Ottomans. Moisi Golemi calculated that it was better to accept Ottoman rule for a period in which the country could regain life and survive, so he decided to submit to the Ottomans and betray his Prince: George Kastriota. Under Ottoman command, Moisi Golemi, who was a very astute strategist, and who was man of great wisdom and visionary, saw, experienced, and perfectly understood the futility of his submission to the Ottomans for the benefit of his people and his country. He deserted the Ottomans and returned to George Kastriota. Eventually, George Kastriota pardoned Moisi Golemi. But there was no clemency expected from Mehmet II, who was an astute strategist himself and understood what Moisi Golemi strived for. Mehmet II would seek searing vengeance for Moisi Golemi's apostasy. The stage is set and Moisi Arianit Golemi suffered an ignominious death, and so did all the other twelve captured Albanian Generals: They were all skinned alive publicly in Istanbul.\n\nBallaban received further help from the Sultan and was sent leading Ottoman Armies against Skanderbeg once more, alongside an Albanian Pasha called Jakub Bej Arnauti, this time near Upper Dibra, in the Valley of Vaikal, but Ballaban, Jacub Bej Arnauti, and Ottoman Armies were again defeated. Jacub Bej Arnauti perished in that battle.\n\nDuring all these historical endeavors, Constantine, son of Milosch and Helena, brother of the boy Michael who had become Ballaban Badera, was a soldier under the command of George Kastriota fighting against the Ottoman Armies led by his brother. Milosch, father of the kidnapped boy Michael, was also a soldier under George Kastriota's command. Even though a Serbian, Milosch identified with the Albanian Cause having been left no choice by the policies of the Serbian Despot, Đurađ Branković, who would become either Moslem or Christian depending on policies of the moment. Milosch became sworn brothers (\"vllam\" in Albanian and \"probratim\" in Serbian), a widespread practice among Albanians and Serbs at the time, with the forester of Muzak Stresi, the Lord of Shkodër Milosch and the forester of De Stresses would foster Morsinia (named after Elizabeth Morsiney bride of King Sigismund of Hungary), the Albanian Heiress of De Stresses, daughter of Musache de Stresses and Mara Cernoviche who were murdered by Amesas Kastriota, the infamous nephew of George Kastriota (Skanderbeg).\n\nAmesas Kastriota had appropriated the vast estates of the De Stresses and had birth claims over the estates of the Kastriotas; Ballaban Badera saw the opportunity and organized the coronation of Amesas Kastiota as king of Albania, under vassalage of the Ottomans. George Kastriota (Skanderbeg) learned of the plans and gives the order that it must be stopped at any cost and all of Albania must take up arms. The Battle of Albulena ensued and Amesas Kastriota was captured.\n\nBallban Badera later came as a commanding general of the army under Mehmet II during the Second Siege of Krujë (1466), where he kept the city besieged for just under a year. In that battle, Ballaban Badera was killed by an arquebus shot to the neck by Gjergj Aleksi, a defender of the city and a hunter in his civilian life. After Ballaban's death, the Ottoman Army stationed in Albania lost its unity and was soon defeated.\n\n\n"}

He revived the practices of mezzotint and pure aquatint, while expanding the expressive power of line in drypoint etching and engraving. Short also wrote about printmaking to educate a wider public and was President of the Royal Society of Painter Etcher & Engavers (now styled the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers) from 1910 to 1938.\n\nFrancis (Frank) Job Short was born on 19 June 1857, in Wollaston, a suburb of Stourbridge, Worcestershire. He was first educated to be a civil engineer.\n\nShort was engaged on various works in the Midlands until 1881, when he came to London as assistant to Baldwin Latham in connection with the Parliamentary Inquiry into the pollution of the river Thames. In 1883 he was elected an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Having studied at the Stourbridge School of Art in his early years he joined the South Kensington School of Art (the first name of the current Royal College of Art) in 1883. Short also studied at the life class under Professor Fred Brown at the Westminster School of Art, and for a short time at the Schools of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours.\n\nHis real life-work now became that of an original and translator engraver. He was a keen student of the works of JMW Turner; and his etchings and mezzotints from Turner's \"Liber Studiorum\" (1885 seq.), examples of painstaking devotion and skill, were among his earliest successes, combining sympathetic study of the originals with a full knowledge of the resources of engraving and unwearied patience. Short received praise, constant advice and encouragement from John Ruskin, and the co-operation of students of Turner such as William George Rawlinson and the Revd. Stopford Augustus Brooke. After completing the series from the existing plates of Turner's \"Liber\" Short turned to the subjects which Turner and his assistants had left incomplete. Several remarkable plates resulted from this study, bearing the simple lettering \"F. Short, Sculp., after J. M. W. Turner, R.A.,\" which told little of the work expended on their production even before the copper was touched. He was consulted by Whistler for his expertise in printmaking and became friends.\n\nShort also reproduced in fine mezzotints several pictures of George Frederick Watts, \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" \"Diana and Endymion,\" \"Love and Death,\" \"Hope,\" and the portrait of Lord Tennyson, all remarkable as faithful and imaginative renderings. His own fine quality as a watercolour painter made him also a sympathetic engraver of the landscapes of David Cox and Peter de Wint.\n\nA blue plaque marks Short's former home from 1898 to 1927 at 56 Brook Green, Brook Green, Hammersmith, London.\n\nCoastal landscapes, river estuaries, meadows and foreshores in Devon, Norfolk, Sussex, Cornwall and the north of England captivated him for his entire working life. Short's subtle and reticent drawing of the receding lines of the low banks and shallows of river estuaries and flat shores is seen to perfection in many of his original etchings, mezzotints, and aquatints, notably \"Low Tide and the Evening Star\" and \"The Solway at Mid-day.\" Other notable plates are:\n\nAs head of the Engraving School at the Royal College of Art, South Kensington from 1892-1920 and the inaugural Professor of Engraving from 1920 to 1924, Short had enormous influence on younger painter-etchers and engravers, including Percival Gaskell RE, Margaret Kemp-Welch RE, Martin Hardin RE, Job Nixon RE, Robert Austin RA, PPRE, Mary Annie Sloane, ARE, Malcolm Osborne RA, PPRE, Henry Rushbury RA, RE, Dorothy Woollard RE, Frederick Griggs RA, RE, Stanley Anderson RA, RE, Constance Mary Pott, and Eli Marsden Wilson ARE amongst many others. [3] It is well recorded that Short was an outstanding and inspirational teacher.\n\nShort was elected a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1885, and took a prominent part in conducting its affairs, becoming assessor (vice-president) in 1902. In 1910 he succeeded Sir Francis Seymour Haden as its second president for 28 years, steering the society through the First World War and the etching boom of the 1920s and its crash from 1929.\n\nShort received, amongst other distinctions, the gold medal for engraving at the Paris International Exhibition, 1889, and another gold medal for mezzotint (Rappel) 1900. In 1906 Short was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, when membership as Associate Engraver was revived; and in 1911 he was elected a full Royal Academician, and also received a knighthood. His work as a watercolourist was recognised in 1917 when he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. Short was Treasurer of the Royal Academy from 1919 to 1932.\n\nShort wrote several influential books on original printmaking: \"On the Making of Etchings\" was first published in 1888 and republished in 1911, 1912, 1951 and is still in print today. \"British Mezzotints\" from 1924 is a standard reference on original mezzotints.\n\n\"The Etched and Engraved Work of Frank Short\", by Edward F Strange (1908), describes 285 plates by the artist.

Concerning the Norse claim, Roberta Frank reviewed the historical evidence for the ritual in her \"Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle\", where she writes: \"By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the various saga motifs—eagle sketch, rib division, lung surgery, and 'saline stimulant'—were combined in inventive sequences designed for maximum horror.\" She concludes that the authors of the sagas misunderstood alliterative kennings that alluded to leaving one's foes face down on the battlefield, their backs torn as carrion by scavenging birds. If this is to be believed, then it is easy to surmise that the mention of his death via the blood eagle, is in fact a description of his death on the battlefield, which would make both accounts of his death true.\n\nÆlla became king after Osberht (Osbryht) was deposed. The beginning of his reign is traditionally dated to 862 or 863 but evidence about Northumbrian royal chronology is unreliable prior to 867. His reign may have begun as late as 866. Almost nothing is known of Ælla's reign; Symeon of Durham states that Ælla had seized lands at Billingham, Ileclif, Wigeclif, and Crece, which belonged to the church. While Ælla is described in most sources as a tyrant and an illegitimate king, one source states that he was Osberht's brother.\n\nThe Great Heathen Army, composed mostly of Danish, Norwegian and Frisian Vikings, landed in Northumbria in mid-866 and had captured York by 21 November.\n\nSubsequent events are described by historians such as Symeon of Durham, Asser and Æthelweard in accounts that vary only in detail. According to the \"Historia Regum Anglorum\", following the invasion of the Danes, the previous \"dissension\" between Osberht and Ælla \"was allayed by divine counsel\" and other Northumbrian nobles. Osberht and Ælla \"having united their forces and formed an army, came to the city of York\" on 21 March 867. A majority of the \"shipmen\" (Vikings) gave the impression of fleeing from the approaching Northumbrians. \"The Christians, perceiving their flight and terror\", attacked, but found that the Vikings \"were the stronger party\". Surrounded, the Northumbrians \"fought upon each side with much ferocity\" until both Osberht and Ælla were killed. The surviving Northumbrians \"made peace with the Danes\".\n\nAfter this, the Vikings appointed a puppet king of Northumbria, named Ecgberht. According to an Anglo-Norman genealogy, Ælla had a daughter named Æthelthryth and through her was the grandfather of Eadwulf of Bamburgh, \"King of the Northern English\" who died in 913.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" does not name the Viking leaders, but it does state that \"Hingwar and Hubba\" (probably Ivar and Ubba) later killed King Edmund of East Anglia. Ubba was also named as a leader of the army in Northumbria by Abbo of Fleury and by the \"Historia de Sancto Cuthberto\". Symeon of Durham lists the leaders of the Viking army as \"Halfdene [Halfdann], Inguar [Ingvar], Hubba, Beicsecg, Guthrun, Oscytell [Ketill], Amund, Sidroc and another duke of the same name, Osbern, Frana and Harold.\"\n\nAccording to \"Ragnarssona þáttr\", the army that seized York in 866 was led by Hvitserk, Björn Ironside, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, Ivar the Boneless and Ubba, sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, who avenged his death by subjecting Ælla to the blood eagle. However, Anglo-Saxon sources claim that Ælla and Osberht died in battle at York, with the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" stating that \"both the kings were slain on the spot\".\n\nIvar the Boneless, who plays a major role in both Norse and Anglo-Saxon accounts, is sometimes associated with the Viking leader Ímar (), a King of Dublin mentioned in the Irish annals. This is unlikely, however, as Ímar's father is usually said to be Gofraid of Lochlann and his brothers are usually named as Amlaíb Conung and Auisle. As Dorothy Whitelock notes, the names \"Ívarr\" and \"Ímar\" were \"not uncommon\" in Norse societies.\n\nHector Boece relates that two Northumbrian princes, Osbrecht and Ella, took the castle at Stirling.\n\nAella, King of Northumbria, has a major supporting role in Geoffrey Chaucer’s \"The Man of Law's Tale\".\n\nÆlla was played by Frank Thring in the film \"The Vikings\" (1958) as the main antagonist.\n\nA character broadly based on Ælla is played by Ivan Kaye in the History Channel's drama series \"Vikings\" (2013). The show gives no indication that this Ælla had usurped his throne, and he is shown to have reigned in Northumbria for more than 15 years. The show portrays Ælla as being executed by blood eagle following a battle which is said to stand \"near York\".\nThe show also gave Ælla a daughter, Judith, who takes the historical role of Osburh, as the mother of Alfred the Great. The character's name seems taken from Judith of Flanders, Alfred's stepmother, but doesn't share much more.\n\nIn \"The Last Kingdom\", a historical novel by Bernard Cornwell, Ælla appears very briefly as a minor character at the beginning of the book. He, along with Osberht and Uhtred, a fictional Ealdorman of Bernicia, lead a Northumbrian army to repel invading Danes at York. The battle ends disastrously for the Northumbrians when the Norse army feigns a retreat, and Ælla dies on the field.\n\n\n"}

The theorem was proven independently in 1907 by Frigyes Riesz and Ernst Sigismund Fischer.\n\nFor many authors, the Riesz–Fischer theorem refers to the fact that the \"L\" spaces from Lebesgue integration theory are complete.\n\nThe most common form of the theorem states that a measurable function on [–, ] is square integrable if and only if the corresponding Fourier series converges in the space \"L\". This means that if the \"N\"th partial sum of the Fourier series corresponding to a square-integrable function \"f\" is given by\n\nwhere \"F\", the \"n\"th Fourier coefficient, is given by\n\nthen\n\nwhere formula_4 is the \"L\"-norm.\n\nConversely, if formula_5 is a two-sided sequence of complex numbers (that is, its indices range from negative infinity to positive infinity) such that\n\nthen there exists a function \"f\" such that \"f\" is square-integrable and the values formula_7 are the Fourier coefficients of \"f\".\n\nThis form of the Riesz–Fischer theorem is a stronger form of Bessel's inequality, and can be used to prove Parseval's identity for Fourier series.\n\nOther results are often called the Riesz–Fischer theorem . Among them is the theorem that, if \"A\" is an orthonormal set in a Hilbert space \"H\", and \"x\" ∈ \"H\", then\nfor all but countably many \"y\" ∈ \"A\", and\nFurthermore, if \"A\" is an orthonormal basis for \"H\" and \"x\" an arbitrary vector, the series\nconverges \"commutatively\" (or \"unconditionally\") to \"x\". This is equivalent to saying that for every \"ε\" > 0, there exists a finite set \"B\" in \"A\" such that\nfor every finite set \"B\" containing \"B\". Moreover, the following conditions on the set \"A\" are equivalent:\n\nAnother result, which also sometimes bears the name of Riesz and Fischer, is the theorem that \"L\" (or more generally \"L\", 0 < \"p\" ≤ ∞) is complete.\n\nThe Riesz–Fischer theorem also applies in a more general setting. Let \"R\" be an inner product space consisting of functions (for example, measurable functions on the line, analytic functions in the unit disc; in old literature, sometimes called Euclidean Space), and let formula_13 be an orthonormal system in \"R\" (e.g. Fourier basis, Hermite or Laguerre polynomials, etc. – see orthogonal polynomials), not necessarily complete (in an inner product space, an orthonormal set is complete if no nonzero vector is orthogonal to every vector in the set). The theorem asserts that if the normed space \"R\" is complete (thus \"R\" is a Hilbert space), then any sequence formula_14 that has finite \"ℓ\" norm defines a function \"f\" in the space \"R\".\n\nThe function \"f\" is defined by\nformula_15, limit in \"R\"-norm.\n\nCombined with the Bessel's inequality, we know the converse as well: if \"f\" is a function in \"R\", then the Fourier coefficients formula_16 have finite \"ℓ\" norm.\n\nIn his Note, states the following result (translated here to modern language at one point: the notation \"L\"([\"a\", \"b\"]) was not used in 1907).\n\nToday, this result of Riesz is a special case of basic facts about series of orthogonal vectors in Hilbert spaces.\n\nRiesz's Note appeared in March. In May, states explicitly in a theorem (almost with modern words) that a Cauchy sequence in \"L\"([\"a\", \"b\"]) converges in \"L\"-norm to some function \"f\"  in \"L\"([\"a\", \"b\"]). In this Note, Cauchy sequences are called \"\"sequences converging in the mean\"\" and \"L\"([\"a\", \"b\"]) is denoted by Ω. Also, convergence to a limit in \"L\"–norm is called \"\"convergence in the mean towards a function\"\". Here is the statement, translated from French:\nFischer goes on proving the preceding result of Riesz, as a consequence of the orthogonality of the system, and of the completeness of \"L\".\n\nFischer's proof of completeness is somewhat indirect. It uses the fact that the indefinite integrals of the functions \"g\" in the given Cauchy sequence, namely \nconverge uniformly on [\"a\", \"b\"] to some function \"G\", continuous with bounded variation.\nThe existence of the limit \"g\" ∈ \"L\" for the Cauchy sequence is obtained by applying to \"G\" differentiation theorems from Lebesgue's theory. \nRiesz uses a similar reasoning in his Note, but makes no explicit mention to the completeness of \"L\", although his result may be interpreted this way. He says that integrating term by term a trigonometric series with given square summable coefficients, he gets a series converging uniformly to a continuous function \"F\"  with bounded variation. The derivative \"f\"  of \"F\", defined almost everywhere, is square summable and has for \"Fourier coefficients\" the given coefficients.\n\nFor some authors, notably Royden, the Riesz-Fischer Theorem is the result that \"L\" is complete: that every Cauchy sequence of functions in \"L\" converges to a function in \"L\", under the metric induced by the \"p\"-norm. The proof below is based on the convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral; the result can also be obtained for formula_20 by showing that every Cauchy sequence has a rapidly converging Cauchy sub-sequence, that every Cauchy sequence with a convergent sub-sequence converges, and that every rapidly Cauchy sequence in \"L\" converges in \"L\".\n\nWhen 1 ≤ \"p\" ≤ ∞, the Minkowski inequality implies that the space \"L\" is a normed space. In order to prove that \"L\" is complete, i.e. that \"L\" is a Banach space, it is enough (see e.g. Banach space#Definition) to prove that every series ∑ \"u\" of functions in \"L\"(\"μ\") such that\n\nconverges in the \"L\"-norm to some function \"f\" ∈ \"L\"(\"μ\"). For \"p\" < ∞, the Minkowski inequality and the monotone convergence theorem imply that\n\nis defined \"μ\"–almost everywhere and \"f\" ∈ \"L\"(\"μ\"). The dominated convergence theorem is then used to prove that the partial sums of the series converge to \"f\" in the \"L\"-norm,\n\nThe case 0 < \"p\" < 1 requires some modifications, because the \"p\"-norm is no longer subadditive. One starts with the stronger assumption that\n\nand uses repeatedly that\n\nThe case \"p\" = ∞ reduces to a simple question about uniform convergence outside a \"μ\"-negligible set.\n\n"}

The island covers an area of circa . It is part of the South Funen Archipelago and has 6,111 inhabitants. The Danish national road 9 crosses the island.\n\nUntil the municipality reform of 1970, the island retained its own municipality (sognekommune). Since 1970, it has been part of Svendborg Municipality.\n\nBefore the 1960s, when the island became connected to Funen via the Svendborgsund Bridge and to Langeland via the Langeland Bridge, it was served by ferries from Svendborg to Vindeby and from Vemmenæs to Rudkøbing respectively.\n\nUntil 2011 the public schools on the island consisted of two separate entities, \"Lundby Skole\" and \"Sundhøjskolen\", but in 2011 they were merged into a single structure called \"Tåsingeskolen\" with close to 800 pupils, by far the largest school in the entire municipality.\n\nThe inhabitants of the island refer to themselves as \"Tøsinger\". The local dialect called \"tåsingsk\" is still in use on the island, though not as common as in the past.\n\nThe meaning of the island's name (Tåsinge) has been a matter of debate throughout the past couple of hundred years. The Knýtlinga saga mentions as a place name \"þórslundr\" ('Thor's Grove') in its description of Denmark (chap. 32) and though it might refer to the island of Tåsinge, it could also well be referring to another place near Odense\nThe first time Tåsinge clearly appears in the sources is in the Danish Census Book from around 1231, where it is called Thosland, and this designation seems to have been in proper use for a very long time, until the Age of Enlightenment, when antiquarians of the day because of the rudimentary state of etymology reinterpreted the name as 'Thorseng' or 'Thorsing', believing the name to mean 'Thors seng' or 'Thors eng' (lit. Thors bed/Thors meadow). This particular change in the island's name was seen in use for more than a century until gradually it changed into the now used form.\n\nEtymologists presently consider the prefix to be a root of old norse 'Thōs', meaning 'melting', 'thawing' and alike, possibly referring to the narrow strait of Svendborgsund which separates the island from Funen. The suffix '-land' is likely referring to the island itself (ref. the village name of Landet, central on the island), often used in Danish place names to characterize 'larger islands' (e.g. neighbouring Langeland).\n\nTåsinge is historically divided into three parishes, corresponding to the three main villages on the island, Bregninge, at the northern part of the island, Landet at the central and Bjerreby at the southern part. The largest settlements besides these are Vindeby, Troense, Lundby and Strammelse.\n\nThe north and northeasternmost part of the island, comprising Vindeby and Troense, has seen a large increase in demographics since the construction of the Svendborgsund Bridge and has virtually become a suburb of Svendborg, while the rest of the island in large parts has retained its rural and historical boundaries. In the north commuters who work in the Svendborg area and retired senior citizens live, while the rest of the island is mostly occupied by farming and agriculture.\n\nSydfyns Flyveplads (Tåsinge International Airport) , the only major aerodrome in the vincity, is situated on the western part of the island, providing trips for both business and recreational purposes.\n\nTåsinge has been a tourist destination for more than 100 years, the main attractions being the islands idyllic and surprisingly diverse nature as well as the many preserved historic buildings, often several hundreds of years old.\n\nThe island itself also had its fair share of historical events. For several decades in the 14th century, the island (along with the whole of Funen and large parts of modern Denmark in general) was pawned to Holstein nobles, but was reunited with Denmark under the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag. During the Dano-Swedish War (1658–60) the island was overrun by Swedish troops, plundering the villages and leaving a devastated population, and still later, during the Dano-Swedish War of 1808–09 the island was frequently used for both camp and as a transport hub for the French-Spanish reinforcements.\n\nFrom the 17th century on, during the Age of absolutism, the first baron on Valdemars Castle (who had won the rights to the castle following the Battle of Køge Bay) and his inheritors soon amassed as much land on the island as possible, effectively making the ever-sitting baron the de facto owner and feudal lord of almost the entire island, with the farmers remaining as tenants and copyholders, from the first part of the 18th century and right until the conversion of entailed estates into fee simple (\"Lensafløsningen\") 1919. Tåsinge also had its own \"birkeret\", presided by the baron as supreme judicial court as well (also until 1919). The population (3,600 in 1823) was all peasantry or sailors.\n\nA popular local anecdote, to put this in perspective, tells of the smith of Troense, who owned a small patch of land next to his house, and proudly announced that \"\"Me and the Baron owns the entire island!\"\"\n\nThe male line of the barons Juel were however not necessarily only harsh lords, but introduced several new occupations and innovations to the island through the years, such as the (later) important apple farming, attempts at industrial cloth production (a \"klædefabrik\", 1752–58) and public schools (1795) among other things.\n\nToday, Valdemars Slot and surrounding area are among the most well known tourist spots on the island.\n\nThe nearby village of Troense, situated slightly opposite Svendborg, picturesque with a view to Svendborgsund and neighboring Valdemars Slot, is particularly famed for its well-dimensioned and idyllic half timbered houses, build by wealthy sea captains and sailors through the golden period in the Age of Sails, when large sailing ships were being constructed on local shipyards and manned for faraway destinations.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the Troense area was extremely popular among tourists (and still is), becoming easier to reach with modern transportation such as train and ferry, and with cheap accommodations and activities such as sea bathing, excursions, relaxation, social gatherings, etc. In the summer season, the visitors would typically book one of several private pensions, a large part of the village effectively becoming a resort town in the early decades of the 20th century. Among the more well known visitors were the composer Rued Langgaard and the writer Henri Nathansen.\n\nTroense is also known as the last place where Elvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre stayed in July 1889, before going on a \"picnic with Death\" in the nearby Nørreskov forest. This tragic, infamous incident has become an integral part of the island's lore. Today it is a tourist magnet as the couple is resting side by side in the churchyard at nearby Landet Kirke. The precise location of their murder-suicide in the forest of Nørreskov is marked by a granite boulder.\n\nAbout a kilometer west of Valdemars Castle, next to the road leading there, stands the so-called Ambrosius Oak, which is a 400-year-old giant oak with a circumference of around 7.5 meters. The name refers to the Danish rococo poet Ambrosius Stub (whose surname literally means '(tree) stub'), which was serving for more than a decade (1739–52) as a secretary and handyman to the baron of Valdemars Castle, and who is said to have often been sitting under the tree relaxing or writing.\n\nThe highest point on the island is \"Bregninge Bakke\" (Bregninge Hill), ca. 70 m.a.s.l. (about 229.5 ft.). Bregninge Kirke is situated on top of the hill, and from its tower, in clear weather, it is possible to see large parts of the South Funen Archipelago. It is said that one can observe 28 islands, 65 churches and 20 manors from here. There is public access to the church in the daytime and (for a modest and optional fee) to the observation deck in the tower. The surrounding of the hill is designated as a protected habitat. In the porch of the church lies a romanesque headstone placed over a deacon inscribed with runes. Situated next to the church is Tåsinge Museum (Museum of Tåsinge), which serves as a local folk museum for the historic life of mainly the sailors of old time Tåsinge, but also houses in a separate building a large collection of music instruments, note sheets etc., pertaining to traditional folk music.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars a semaphore line tower, a branch of \"Storebæltstelegrafen\", was placed further to the north on the hill.\n\nFrom around 1850 until the first part of the 20th century, the prospects for many young people were to become tenants or copyholders on the island like their parents, without many possibilities of ascending in life. Accordingly, many emigrated to the United States. Søren Lolk, an enlightened farmer, educator, photographer and vitalist from Tåsinge visited some of the emigrated \"tøsinger\" in the United States over four months in 1903 and photographed and collected evidence from them, before returning.\n\nThe local archive of Landet keeps both Lolks collections and other evidence of the connections, and regularly receives requests from far and away relatives to once Tåsinge born residents.\n\nElvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre, whose tragic love affair has been portrayed in several works of art, were depicted in Bo Widerberg's 1967 film \"Elvira Madigan\". However, none of the scenes in the film were shot on location on Tåsinge, but rather in Klampenborg and Scania.\n\n\n"}

The genus has a wide distribution, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America, and missing only from Australia. Some botanists split the genus into two genera on the basis of the catkin and fruit structure, restricting \"Myrica\" to a few species, and treating the others in \"Morella\".\n\nCommon names include bayberry, bay-rum tree, candleberry, sweet gale, and wax-myrtle. The generic name was derived from the Greek word μυρικη (\"myrike\"), meaning \"fragrance\".\n\nThe species vary from 1 m shrubs up to 20 m trees; some are deciduous, but the majority of species are evergreen. The roots have nitrogen-fixing bacteria which enable the plants to grow on soils that are very poor in nitrogen content. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, 2–12 cm long, oblanceolate with a tapered base and broader tip, and a crinkled or finely toothed margin. The flowers are catkins, with male and female catkins usually on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is a small drupe, usually with a wax coating.\n\nThe type species, \"Myrica gale\", is holarctic in distribution, growing in acidic peat bogs throughout the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere; it is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 m tall. The remaining species all have relatively small ranges, and are mostly warm-temperate.\n\n\"Myrica faya\" (\"Morella faya\"), native to the volcanic islands of Madeira and the Canary Islands, has become an invasive species on the Hawaiian volcanoes where it was introduced in the 19th century; its ability to fix nitrogen makes it very well adapted to growing on low-nitrogen volcanic soils.\n\nThe wax coating on the fruit is indigestible for most birds, but a few species have adapted to be able to eat it, notably the yellow-rumped warbler and tree swallow in North America. As the wax is very energy-rich, this enables the yellow-rumped warbler to winter further north in cooler climates than any other American warbler if bayberries are present. The seeds are then dispersed in the birds' droppings. \"Myrica\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, emperor moth, and winter moth as well as the bucculatricid leaf-miners \"Bucculatrix cidarella\", \"B. myricae\" (feeds exclusively on \"M. gale\") and \"B. paroptila\" and the \"Coleophora\" case-bearers \"C. comptoniella\", \"C. pruniella\", and \"C. viminetella\".\n\nThe wax coating on the fruit of several species, known as bayberry wax, has been used traditionally to make candles. It was used for that purpose by the Robinson family in the novel \"The Swiss Family Robinson\". The foliage of \"Myrica gale\" is a traditional insect repellent, used by campers to keep biting insects out of tents. Several species are also grown as ornamental plants in gardens. The fruit of \"Myrica rubra\" is an economically important crop in China, sold fresh, dried, canned, for juice, and for alcoholic beverages. Myrica is used to spice beer and snaps in Denmark.\n\n\n"}

Eric Daniels was found as a second guitarist and Chuck Colli joined on vocals and bass guitar; this line up released the \"Enter the Domain\" demo. In March 1989, Colli was replaced by Theo Loomans and the band recorded the \"Crush the Cenotaph\" demo. Brookhuis then left the band and the remaining three recorded \"Embrace the Death\", an album which was never released because of label problems.\n\nAfter leaving Pestilence in the early 1990s, Martin van Drunen joined Asphyx and the band signed to Century Media Records. After the release of their first album, \"The Rack\", they went on a European tour with Entombed, followed by a tour with Bolt Thrower and Benediction in 1992. Shortly after the recording of the second album, \"Last One on Earth\", van Drunen left the band, to be replaced by Ron van der Pol. Eventually Bagchus left the band as well and was replaced by Sander van Hoof.\n\nIn 1994, the band released its third, self-titled album, but broke up shortly afterward. In 1995, Loomans and Bagchus reformed Asphyx and recorded \"God Cries\". Around the same time, the \"Embrace the Death\" album, recorded in 1990, was released. Nevertheless, the band split up again after the release. In 1998, Loomans died when a train hit his car. The circumstances suggest it was an act of suicide. Some time later, Soulburn was founded by Bagchus and Daniels and, together with Pentacle singer and bass guitarist Wannes Gubbels, they recorded \"Feeding on Angels\". In 1999, they renamed the project Asphyx and recorded the \"On the Wings of Inferno\" album with the same line up. However, Asphyx disbanded again in 2000.\n\nIn January 2007, the band re-united with van Drunen, Gubbels, Paul Baayens and Bagchus.

Internationally, she is best known for her 1987 single \"Boys (Summertime Love)\", which topped the charts in France and Switzerland, and peaked at No. 3 in the UK. The song was accompanied by a provocative music video, which established Sabrina's image as a sex symbol. Her other popular recordings include \"All of Me (Boy Oh Boy)\", \"My Chico\", \"Like a Yo-Yo\", \"Gringo\", \"Siamo donne\" and \"Call Me\".\n\nAfter winning a beauty contest in her native region, Liguria, Sabrina started modelling, and in 1984 made her television debut on the Italian prime time show \"Premiatissima\" on Canale 5. In 1986, her debut single \"Sexy Girl\", sung in English, was released. Produced by Claudio Cecchetto, it became a Top 20 hit in her native Italy and a modest international success. In late 1987, she released her first studio album, \"Sabrina\", which was entirely sung in English. In addition to \"Sexy Girl\", the album included her international breakthrough hit \"Boys (Summertime Love)\" (number-one in both in France and Switzerland, and Top 5 in over 10 more countries), and \"Hot Girl\", a Top 20 hit in some European countries. \"Boys\" gained popularity for its famous video, which included sexually suggestive scenes. The song has sold more than 1.5 million copies to date worldwide and remains Sabrina's trademark hit.\n\nIn 1988, Sabrina received the \"Best European Singer\" award during the Festivalbar event, and enjoyed another European-wide summer hit with the single \"All of Me (Boy Oh Boy)\", produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. Later in that year, her second studio album, \"Super Sabrina\", was released, and she maintained her image as a European sex symbol thanks to the raunchy videos that accompanied hits such as \"My Chico\" (her highest-charting single in Italy) and \"Like a Yo-Yo\", produced by Giorgio Moroder. The latter became the musical theme of \"Odiens\", a very popular Italian prime time TV-show, in which Sabrina also appeared. Thanks to the success of her music and modelling, Sabrina performed in many European countries, among others at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1988 and at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow, Russia, in 1989, where over three days 50,000 people gathered to see her perform. In 1989, she starred in the Italian comedy film \"Fratelli d'Italia\", directed by Neri Parenti, alongside such actors as Christian De Sica, Jerry Calà, and Massimo Boldi. She also released a new single, \"Gringo\", to a moderate success, and her first remix album called \"Super Remix\".\n\nIn 1990, Sabrina was the hostess of the weekly prime time TV-show \"Ricomincio da 2\" with Raffaella Carrà on Rai Due, and released a new single called \"Yeah Yeah\", which only was a modest hit. 1991 marked a turning point in Sabrina's career, when she recorded a duet with Italian singer Jo Squillo, \"Siamo donne\", her first release in Italian language. They performed the song together at the 1991's Sanremo Music Festival to much acclaim. Sabrina's third studio album, \"Over the Pop\", was released the same year, and for the first time she was allowed to co-write and produce some of the songs. Sabrina's desire for independence and distancing from her glamour career led to a conflict with her management. As a result, the promotion of the album suffered, and both the album and the follow-up single \"Shadows of the Night\" were commercial failures. A brand new single, \"Cover Model\", was released in France and Italy, but was unsuccessful in the charts, and Sabrina parted ways with her label and management.\n\nSabrina released several non-album singles between 1994 and 1995, including the moderately successful \"Angel Boy\" and a new version of \"Boys\". In 1996, she established her own recording studio in Treviso with her then-husband Enrico Monti, and released her first Italian language album, \"Maschio dove sei\" which showcased her more mature pop rock sound. The album and its two singles, \"Fatta e rifatta\" and the title-track, were surprisingly acclaimed by the critics, but turned out commercial failures due to a lack of promotion and distribution. The album would be re-released the following year as \"Numeri\", featuring the new title song. Sabrina debuted as a theatrical actress in the comedy \"I cavalieri della Tavola Rotonda\", playing the role of Morgan le Fay, and then hosted the game show \"Il mercante in fiera\".\n\nIn 1998, Sabrina was cast in a comedy called \"Uomini sull'orlo di una crisi di nervi\" which was also very successful, and subsequently hosted the TV-show \"Cocco di mamma\" on Rai Uno. In this show she would sing some Italian and international summer hits of the past, what led her to launching a comeback in music. In 1999, Sabrina released a new album, \"A Flower's Broken\". Although the music video accompanying the song \"I Love You\" sparked some interest, both the album and the single were unsuccessful, largely due to the dissolution of her label RTI Music. Sabrina appeared on the British TV-show \"Eurotrash\" where she performed \"I Love You\".\n\n2001 saw Sabrina's comeback to theatre with the musical \"Emozioni\", where she starred alongside Vladimir Luxuria. The play received very good reviews from critics and toured Italy for almost three years. In 2002, Sabrina hosted another TV-show on Italia 1 called \"Matricole & Meteore\", in which she uncovered the current situations of former superstars, such as Shannen Doherty, Al Corley, Gary Coleman, and Charlene Tilton. In 2005, she starred in the independent film \"Colori\" which premiered at Salerno's Independent Cinema Festival, where she won the Critics' Choice Award for \"Best Actress\". In November of that year, Sabrina performed at the nostalgia concert \"Diskoteka 80-kh\" in Russia. The following year, she premiered a new song called \"I Feel Love (Good Sensation)\" on her website.\n\nIn 2007, Sabrina toured France and published a cover version of the disco classic \"Born to Be Alive\" on her Myspace page. In 2008, she toured France again, with the nostalgia tour RFM Party 80, organized by the French radio network RFM. She also performed at another 80s revival concert in Poland, which was part of Sopot Festival, together with Kim Wilde, Samantha Fox, Sandra, Thomas Anders (ex-Modern Talking), Limahl, and Shakin' Stevens. In October 2008, Sabrina released a double album, called \"Erase/Rewind Official Remix\", which included new versions of her old hits as well as several new tracks and cover versions.\n\nIn 2010, Sabrina and English singer Samantha Fox released a cover version of Blondie's hit \"Call Me\" as a duet. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Italian Dance Singles Sales Chart. During the summer of 2010 she hosted the prime time TV-show \"Mitici 80\" on Italia 1. In 2012, Sabrina starred as herself in the French movie \"Stars 80\", directed by Frédéric Forestier and produced by Thomas Langmann, and was on another RFM tour in France. In 2013, Sabrina featured on Neon Neon's song \"Shopping (I Like To)\", from the duo's second studio album \"Praxis Makes Perfect\". During the same year, she continued touring in France with the RFM Party and started recording new material. During March and April 2014, Sabrina performed with and mentored a dance group called LECCEzione on Rai 1 prime time TV-show \"La Pista\". In June, she released a Rick Nowels-produced single called \"Colour Me\", written and co-produced by Sabrina herself.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1836257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836257", "title": "Erick Morillo", "text": "Erick Morillo\n\nErick Morillo (born 26 March 1971) is a Colombian-American DJ, music producer and record label owner. Having produced under a number of pseudonyms, including Ministers de la Funk, The Dronez, RAW, Smooth Touch, RBM, Deep Soul, Club Ultimate and Li'l Mo Ying Yang, Morillo is best known for his international work in house music, in particular for the label Strictly Rhythm, and the 1993 hit \"I Like to Move It\", which he produced under the pseudonym Reel 2 Real, and which was featured in commercials, movies and ringtones. His label Subliminal Records has produced the #1 Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play hit \"Fun\" by Da Mob, and won the \"Muzik\" magazine \"Remixer of the Year\" award in 1999. Subliminal also brought attention to artists like Eddie Thoneick, Carl Kennedy and DJ DLG. He is a three-time winner of DJ Awards \"Best House DJ\" in 1998, 2001 and 2003 and a three-time winner of \"Best International DJ\" in 2002, 2006 and 2009 receiving a total of 15 nominations in all from 1998-2010.\n\nErick Morillo was born in 1971 in New York. He spent most of his pre-teen years in Cartagena, Colombia, where he lived with his family, and grew accustomed to salsa and merengue music. He moved back to the United States at age 11, living with his mother, Elisa, and sister, Sheila, in an apartment at 1406 Bergenline Avenue in Union City, New Jersey. Influenced by other genres such as reggae, and hip hop, it was also at age 11 that he began DJing weddings for friends and family. He attended grammar school at Saint Joseph and Michael's School, a private Catholic school, graduating in 1985. He graduated from Emerson High School in Union City in 1989.\n\nMorillo took a studio engineering course let at the New York City's Center for the Media Arts, and began DJing at local clubs, in places like the Love Sexy music lounge on Hudson Street in Hoboken. While working at a club in nearby Weehawken, Morillo met Latin reggae star El General, with whom Morillo became friends. The two collaborated in 1991 on the single, \"Muevelo\", a mixture of reggae, house music, and a sample of T99's techno single \"Anasthasia\" that became a surprise hit, and went platinum.\n\nAs his remixes became familiar in Latin clubs, Morillo branched out through his friendship with New York house veteran \"Little\" Louie Vega, whom he met through then-unknown singer Marc Anthony, with whom Vega had worked on the seminal 1992 house anthem, \"Ride on the Rhythm\". According to Morillo, Vega advised him to \"focus on vocals\". Morillo's next big song came in 1993, when New York's premier house label at the time, Strictly Rhythm, released his \"The New Anthem\"/\"Funky Buddha\" 12. The song did well in the charts and in clubs, garnering attention for Morillo. Later that year, Strictly Rhythm released the Real 2 Real's second single. \"I Like to Move It\". The song, which has been described by \"Mixer\" as \"part Euro-cheese, part pop A&R man's wet dream\", became a staple international dance hit for both Reel 2 Real and Strictly Rhythm. It made Morillo a millionaire and thrust him into a globe-trotting life that included weekly trips to Europe to tape MTV Europe in between stateside promotions. In response to the song's success, Morillo recorded the full-length album \"Move It!\", which was released in 1994, and spawned several singles that did particularly well in England. This was followed with a 1996 album from which another several singles were released, most notably \"Mueve la Cadera\" (\"Move Your Body\").\n\nDespite being believed to have made over $2 million from Reel 2 Real, Morillo feared that his financial success may have hurt both his creative drive and his street credibility. Wanting to create respectable house music, he produced \"Jazz It Up\", launching it under the label of the Erick Morillo Project, in order to ensure street credibility. The song did well, and boosted his confidence. He and Louie Vega collaborated as Lil' Mo' Ying Yang and released the 1995 single \"Reach\". Morillo intended a third album for Reel to Real, but his relationship with the Mad Stuntman soured, which derailed the project. Searching for a way to reinvent himself, Morillo attended The Forum, a self-help seminar in New York City, where he gained insight into finding happiness through things other than wealth and his frantic work schedule. The seminar also enabled him to escape his creative rut by helping him analyze his past and set future goals, one of which was to become a successful global DJ. He abandoned the Reel 2 Real alias in 1996, and concentrated on DJing, becoming a favorite in Ibiza, Europe and Australia.\n\nFinishing his relationship with Strictly Rhythm, Morillo took the advice of Strictly Rhythm owner Mark Finkelstein, whom Morillo calls \"a fair person and a business mentor\", and decided to distance himself from R2R's pop past by launching the Double Platinum management company in 1997 with fellow DJs and producers José Nunez, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Carlos Sosa (aka DJ Sneak), and Junior Sanchez, and his own imprint, Subliminal Records, which is based in Weehawken. Morillo describes Subliminal's sound as \"ghetto music\", which is branded with European-designed record sleeves, \"but with class\". Its first single was 1998's \"Fun\", which featured Chicago diva Dajae's, and drew positive response via test pressings and buzz across the Atlantic. However, Dajae refused to sign the contract with Subliminal, and vocalist Jocelyn Brown was brought in to re-record the vocals. Brown's collaboration with Subliminal is known as \"Da Mob\", and their version of \"Fun\" became a #1 Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play hit. Soon after, however, DJ Sneak left the group for Toronto to start his own management company, and Junior Sanchez united with Roger S. to start one of their own. The remaining trio of Morillo, Romero and Nunez formed the finalized core of Subliminal, and are also known as the remix team The Dronez. With Subliminal, Morillo managed to find the balance between \"underground\" respectability and financial success. The trio won \"Muzik\" magazine's Remixer of the Year award in 1999. Subliminal also brought attention to artists like Eddie Thoneick, Carl Kennedy and DJ DLG.\n\nIn late 1999, Morillo completed a U.S. tour and his club night, dubbed Subliminal Night, is credited with single-handedly resuscitating New York City's ailing club scene, a feat he accomplished by signing up Danny Tenaglia, Darren Emerson, Bob Sinclar, Derrick Carter, Tiger Tim Stevens, Mark Farina and Tony Humphries in guest spots. Morillo has also hosted various other club nights across the globe, such as his mid-week Subliminal Sessions parties at Champs in New York. When they were evicted from that venue, the Sessions relaunched at Centro-Fly. Commenting on his socializing with promoters, Morillo says:\n\nI party with the promoters I play for. A lot of DJs don't like to do that; they play the party, go back to the hotel and then get ready to go home. Not me. I don't deny it! For me a DJ is someone who brings a vibe. If you don't party, then how do you bring that vibe?\n\nMorillo has hosted various other club nights across the globe, such as the annual Crobar party in Miami (ULTRA), and his legendary Subliminal Sessions parties at Pacha in Ibiza, which was named \"Best International Club\" of 2002 and \"Best Ibiza Party\" of 2001 by \"Muzik\" magazine. Ibiza is also where Morillo was crowned \"Best International DJ\" in 2002 and \"Best House DJ\" in 1999 and 2001 at the Pacha Ibiza awards. He has been known to play up to 30 jobs a month in locations including Greece, Malta, Amsterdam, London, Madrid, Belfast, and Russia. According to Morillo, his most memorable job was on Ibiza's White Isle after the September 11 attacks: \"I was playing the closing party of the Space Terrace straight after September 11th. I ended the night with Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\". People were crying and waving American flags, everybody was singing. It's my most emotional memory as a DJ.\"\n\nIn addition to his MTV UK appearances, Morillo hosted MTV Ibiza for two years, presented the UK's Dancestar Awards, and starred in a seven-part Channel 4 series documenting his world travels as a party DJ.\n\nIn 2004, he released his first album under his real name, \"My World\", which features collaborations with such artists as Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who collaborated with Morillo on three tracks, including the dancefloor hit \"Dance I Said\". The label has also spawned other labels, such as Sondos, Subliminal Soul, Bambossa and SUBUSA. The label was distributed by Strictly Rhythm until that label ceased operations in 2002. Today, Subliminal is independently distributed, although Strictly Rhythm reopened its doors in 2007.\n\nMorillo drew attention in June 2013 when he failed to appear at a June 6 show in Long Island, and then on June 12 when he had to be escorted off stage 45 minutes into a set, due to \"erratic behavior.\" According to reports, Morillo appeared to be dazed when he began his set, and his condition worsened after he began it. At one point, he vanished from view, leaving a single loop playing over and over. Morillo later stated on his Twitter page, \"The time has come to take a break and refocus my attention on my health and well-being.\"\n\nOn October 12, 2012, Morillo's former home town of Union City, New Jersey honored him in a ceremony in which the portion of Bergenline Avenue between 14th and 15th Street, where Morillo lived as a youth, was dedicated \"Erick Morillo Way\". Union City Mayor Brian P. Stack praised Morillo, who donated 100 Nook tablets to a local school, by commenting, \"It's important to recognize those in the community who contribute to our hometown,\" Union City Mayor Brian Stack said. \"We can all be proud to call Erick a part of our community.\"\n\nThe DJ Awards organizes the annual electronic music DJ awards event it is the only international ceremony for DJs and also the oldest, the awards are held once a year at Pacha club in Ibiza Spain it is one of the most important accolades an artist can win or be honoured by.\n\nMorillo has won the \"Best International DJ Award\" 3 times and the \"Best House DJ Award\" 3 times and received a total of 15 nominations.\n\nAt the annual Winter Music Conference, Morillo won the \"Best American DJ award (2005) he has been nominated 10 times overall.\n\nMuzik was a UK dance music magazine published by IPC Media from June 1995 to August 2003.\n\n\n"}

Josephus states the traditional belief that this individual was the ancestor of the Greeks.\nAlso serving as the Hebrew name for Greece or Greeks in general, יָוָן \"Yavan\" or \"Yāwān\" has long been considered cognate with the name of the eastern Greeks, the Ionians (Greek Ἴωνες \"Iōnes\", Homeric Greek Ἰάονες \"Iáones\"; Mycenaean Greek *Ιαϝονες \"Iawones\"). The Greek race has been known by cognate names throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Near East and beyond: see Sanskrit \"Yona\" & Sanskrit ( \"yavana\") or proto Aryan languages Sanskrit probably originated. In Greek mythology, the eponymous forefather of the Ionians is similarly called Ion, a son of Apollo. The opinion that Javan is synonymous with Greek Ion and thus fathered the Ionians is common to numerous writers of the early modern period including Sir Walter Raleigh, Samuel Bochart, John Mill and Jonathan Edwards, and is still frequently encountered today.\n\nJavan is also found in apocalyptic literature in the Book of Daniel, 8:21-22 and 11:2, in reference to the King of Greece (יון)—most commonly interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.\n\nWhile Javan is generally associated with the ancient Greeks and Greece (cf. Gen. 10:2, Dan. 8:21, Zech. 9:13, etc.), his sons (as listed in Genesis 10) have usually been associated with locations in the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea and Anatolia: Elishah (modern Cyprus), Tarshish (Tarsus in Cilicia, but after 1646 often identified with Tartessus in Spain), Kittim (modern Cyprus), and Dodanim (alt. 1 Chron. 1:7 'Rodanim,' the island of Rhodes, west of modern Turkey between Cyprus and the mainland of Greece).\n\n"}

In 1944 he formed his own design bureau to engineer liquid-propellant engines. After abandoning the heavy, complex and undercooled German engine designs, Russia's principal engine designer Valentin Glushko turned to Isaev's innovations: thin-walled copper combustion chambers backed by steel support, anti-oscillation baffle to prevent chugging, and the flat injector plate with mixing-swirling injectors. The latter was an enormous simplification of the \"plumbing nightmare\" of the V-2 engine, because it avoided the need for separate fuel lines to each sprayer. Staged combustion (Замкнутая схема) was first proposed by Alexey Isaev in 1949.\n\nAlthough his inventions influenced the design of Glushko's large engines, Isaev was better known for building efficient small rockets. He designed engines for the Soviet anti-missile and anti-aircraft rockets, and in 1951, his engine powered the R-11 Zemlya short-range missile, later named the Scud.

When a function executes, it may add some of its state data to the top of the stack; when the function exits it is responsible for removing that data from the stack. At a minimum, a thread's stack is used to store the location of function calls in order to allow return statements to return to the correct location, but programmers may further choose to explicitly use the stack. If a region of memory lies on the thread's stack, that memory is said to have been allocated on the stack, i.e. stack-based memory allocation.\n\nBecause the data is added and removed in a last-in-first-out manner, stack-based memory allocation is very simple and typically faster than heap-based memory allocation (also known as dynamic memory allocation). Another feature is that memory on the stack is automatically, and very efficiently, reclaimed when the function exits, which can be convenient for the programmer if the data is no longer required. (The same applies to longjmp if it moved to a point before the call to happened.) If however, the data needs to be kept in some form, then it must be copied from the stack before the function exits. Therefore, stack based allocation is suitable for temporary data or data which is no longer required after the creating function exits.\n\nA thread's assigned stack size can be as small as only a few bytes on some small CPUs. Allocating more memory on the stack than is available can result in a crash due to stack overflow. This is also why functions that use are usually prevented from being inlined: should such a function be inlined into a loop, the caller would suffer from an unanticipated growth in stack usage, making an overflow much more likely.\n\nStack-based allocation may also cause minor performance problems: it leads to variable-size stack frames, so that both stack and frame pointers need to be managed (with fixed-size stack frames, one of these is redundant). This is usually much less costly than calling and anyways.\n\nMany Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows implement a function called for dynamically allocating stack memory in a way similar to the heap-based codice_1. A compiler typically translates it to inlined instructions manipulating the stack pointer, similar to how variable-length arrays are handled. Although there is no need to explicitly free the memory, there is a risk of undefined behavior due to stack overflow. The function was present on Unix systems as early as 32/V (1978), but is not part of Standard C or any POSIX standard.\n\nA safer version of called , which reports errors, exists on Microsoft Windows. It requires the use of . gnulib provides an equivalent interface, albeit instead of throwing an SEH exception on overflow, it delegates to when an overlarge size is detected. A similar feature can be emulated using manual accounting and size-checking, such as in the uses of in glibc.\n\nSome processor families, such as the x86, have special instructions for manipulating the stack of the currently executing thread. Other processor families, including PowerPC and MIPS, do not have explicit stack support, but instead rely on convention and delegate stack management to the operating system's application binary interface (ABI).\n\n"}

From 1799 until his premature death in 1814 he kept an extensive diary which is the most complete record ever printed of the daily life of a fur trader in the north. His journals were an account of \"personal doings\", but cannot be considered a diary of inward thoughts. These journals cover everything that happened to him in a most matter-of-fact manner and have yielded much material for historians and other researchers of that time period in North American history.\n\nIn 1792, with his well-known uncle of the same name, Henry became a partner in the North West Company and he was later a wintering partner of the XY Company and the Pacific Fur Company. His diaries record his travels from Lake Superior to the Pacific Ocean. In Canada, he travelled through Ontario, Manitoba, Assiniboia, Keewatin, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. In the United States of America his travels took him through areas that comprise the modern states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. He encountered many different tribes of Indians, and in the north saw much of the Chippewas, the three tribes of the Blackfeet, the Crees, Assiniboines, Sioux, Sarcees, and others. In the south, he reached the Mandans, the Minitari, the Rees, and even the Cheyennes, south of the Missouri River. On the west coast he saw many tribes of the Columbia River, such as the Wanapum. In 1800, during the building of Pembina Post, Red River district, the Indians were extremely inquisitive about Henry's doings with pen and paper. On 27 August 1800, Henry wrote \"I told them that I kept an exact account of the Indians behaviour [also] every word they said was put down...every Indian would be rewarded according to his behaviour.\" In 1808, he travelled with David Thompson from Lake Winnipeg to Fort Vermilion, Alberta.\n\nFrom Fort George, Henry and Donald McTavish (first cousin of Simon McTavish) were being taken back along the Columbia River by five sailors of the Royal Navy to the warship \"HMS Isaac Todd\" when their boat capsized and they drowned.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1836284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836284", "title": "Village guard system", "text": "Village guard system\n\nVillage guards (), officially known as \"Türkiye Güvenlik Köy Korucuları\" (\"Security Village Guards of Turkey\") are paramilitaries recruited mostly from ethnic Kurds but also from ethnic Circassians, Turks, Uzbeks and Kyrgyz as well. Originally they were set up and funded by the Turkish state in the mid-1980s under the direction of Turgut Özal. Their stated purpose was to act as a local militia in towns and villages, protecting against attacks and reprisals from the insurgents of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The rationale behind set up of the system was that it would be helpful to the Turkish Army to have an additional force of people who knew the region and the language in order to assist in military operations against the PKK. The force consists of approximately 90,000 village guards in total.\n\nThe Village Guards were levied according to an amendment to the \"Law of Temporary Village Guards\" of 1924, which was introduced due to the lack of security officers after the war of independence. The amendment was approved by the Turkish parliament in March 1985, after the first major confrontations between the PKK and the Turkish State. There are separate classifications of paid and voluntary village guards, with both being allowed the bear weapons. In 1985 there were 3,679 weapons given to 7,933 village guards. From 1985 to 1990, recruitment of village guards was mainly accomplished by negotiating with tribal chieftain, with the tribes being awarded greater autonomy rights in exchange for their services. \n\nThe village guards are frequently targeted by PKK militants as they are seen as \"traitors\". During the ongoing conflict since 2015, 62 village guards have been killed. The village guards received an attractive salary. At times they received a monthly pay of around $230 US Dollars while at the same time the annual salary was $400. The Village Guards gained wealth through smuggling over the Turkish-Iraqi border for which they had immunity. It was even stated by Van Bruinessen that some village guards were recruited among known smugglers. The amount of village guards surged from 18,000 to 63,000 between 1990 and 1994. \n\nIn 2012 the Turkish Government indicated that it was planning to phase out the village guard system. But when the conflicts start again in 2014, The village guards again assume the local guiding and local protection operations. This time, the state not only accepts volunteers. Now, in order to deal with the unemployment in the region, the government hires young people who just finished military service as commando, to become a village guard. Except for women volunteers, it became difficult to be a village guard since 2014, too many applications were made in the last years. The Gendarmerie General Command brought new conditions to become a village guard after announcing 25,000 people will be employed as village guards in 2019.\n\n\nThe only condition for women is to be a primary school graduate.\n\nSelected ones got 3 weeks of the military education and 2 weeks of military preparations before the guns is delivered. It is compulsory to repeat the training every 18 months.\n\nAfter training continuation to everyday life. The only thing to do is guide the soldiers in operations and keep the night watch in the village.\n\nThe village guards are frequently targeted by PKK militants as they are seen as \"traitors\". During the ongoing conflict since 2015, 62 village guards have been killed. Accepting to become a village guard is a largely voluntary process, although there are exceptions (see below).\n\nAutonomy came also with an immunity for crimes even for rapes or killings. The right to bear army often lead to solving disputes between a village guard and a \"terrorist\" in the killing of the latter. At times also minor conflicts during the soccer game of children or in business relations were solved this way. \n\nWhilst by no means officially endorsed by the Turkish Government, some village guards are reported to have been involved in \"disappearances\", extrajudicial executions and torture,They have been implicated in attacks on Kurdish internally displaced persons returning to their villages after forced evacuation.\n\nDuring the conflict Turkish government used village guard system to distinguish “loyal” and “disloyal” citizens and backed the system with material benefits and coercion.\n\nA report by the Turkish Parliament in 1995 confirmed that village guards have been involved in not just these but a wide range of illegal activities, including killing, extortion, and drug smuggling. Human Rights Watch has stated that for years they have received reports of \"violations by village guards—murders, rapes, robberies, house destruction, and illegal property occupation, among others\". They add however that not all of these reports have been confirmed first hand.\n\nPeople who refused to join the village guards have had their homes burned, or have been forced to leave and their homes and property seized. They have endured sexual assault and humiliation by the Turkish security forces. There have been some attempts by the Turkish authorities to compensate people who have lost property in this way. A member of the Turkish Parliament, Ünal Erkan and former governor of some areas of south-eastern Turkey states that, \"village guards often operated outside the control of the gendarmerie, and that many villagers faced pressure to enter the system\".\n\nThe Turkish Interior Ministry estimated that 296 murders were committed by village guards between 1985 and 1996. In a subsequent report in 2006, the Ministry indicated that some 5,000 village guards were involved in criminal activities. The journalist Gottfried Stein relates former lieutenant in the Turkish Army Yener Soylu as describing the process of persuading some villagers to join the village guards: \"We posed the people with a choice, either they acted as village guards, or they would be resettled in other provinces. In the evening, we staged what appeared to be a skirmish with the guerrillas, we shot at windows and also directed heavy weapons against the village. As the people depended on their harvest and animals, we destroyed their fields and slaughtered the animals. If this did not help, we surrounded the village and sent in the counter-guerrillas.\"The Village Guards have been implicated in attacks on Kurdish internally displaced persons returning to their villages after forced evacuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Located about south of the Austrian capital Vienna, it is chiefly known for the Laxenburg castles, which, beside Schönbrunn, served as the most important summer retreat of the Habsburg monarchs.\n\nLaxenburg became a Habsburg possession in 1333. Duke Albert III (1349–1395) had a hunting lodge erected here (today called \"Altes Schloss\") and vested the settlement with market rights. The castle again decayed afterwards, until in the 17th century it was restored at the behest of Emperor Leopold I. Rebuilt in a Baroque style by the master builder Lodovico Burnacini, it became the centre of extended gardens and pleasure grounds. \n\nFrom 1710 onwards the Baroque \"Blauer Hof\" (Blue Court), also named \"Neues Schloss\" (New Castle), was built according to plans designed by Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt as the residence of the Habsburg vice-chancellor Friedrich Karl von Schönborn. Later Empress Maria Theresa acquired the palace and from 1756 onwards had it lavishly rebuilt by her court architect Nicolò Pacassi with a Rococo interior. Laxenburg became the favourite residence of Maria Theresa and her descendants.\n\nThe parish church of Laxenburg was erected vis-à-vis between 1693 and 1703 by Carlo Antonio Carlone. Emperor Leopold I himself laid the founding stone. Consecrated in 1699, construction works continued between 1703 and 1724 supervised by the architect Matthias Steinl. It was the first building north of the Alps containing swung facade components (characteristics of the High Baroque architecture).\n\nAfter 1780, the castle parks were re-arranged as an English landscape garden. It contains several artificial ponds, and, on an island, Franzensburg Castle, named after emperor Francis I of Austria.\n\nThe current political municipality was established after the 1848 revolutions. In 1854, Emperor Francis Joseph and his consort Elisabeth spent their honeymoon in Laxenburg. Two of their children, Gisela and Crown Prince Rudolf, were born here. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1919, the city of Vienna took over the war-damaged castle. Since then, the city of Vienna became the property owner of the park area.\n\nAfter the Austrian \"Anschluss\" to Nazi Germany in 1938, the municipality of Laxenburg temporarily was incorporated into the city of Greater Vienna. After World War II, castles and parl were seized by Soviet occupation forces. Upon the 1955 Austrian State Treaty, the place became independent again and returned to the state of Lower Austria.\n\nPlans to held the 1967 World's fair in Laxenburg failed. Since 1973, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), a non-governmental research organization with about 200 employees, has been located in the castle. The International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA) is also headquartered in Laxenburg, since it was established in 2010 at the historic Palais Kaunitz-Wittgenstein. The International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) both have their respective secretariat in the city.

In addition to reducing the drying effect of wind, row cover can provide a limited amount of warming by the same effect that cold frames, greenhouses, and polytunnels produce, creating a microclimate for the plants.\n\nCommercially available row cover is usually a lightweight synthetic, such as clear plastic (polyethylene) or spunbonded polyester. It is placed directly above rows of crops on a supporting framework—often, on wire hoops to form a low tunnel—and usually left in place for several weeks until crops are well-established.\n\nFloating row cover is extremely lightweight row cover fabric that can be placed directly over plants, without need for a supporting framework, instead being simply anchored to the ground against wind.\n\nAnother form of lightweight row cover is made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and is a knitted fabric.

It also protects from light frosts, strong winds and hail. It is used on low tunnels.

{"id": "1836322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836322", "title": "Sex magic", "text": "Sex magic\n\nSex magic (sometimes spelled sex magick) is any type of sexual activity used in magical, ritualistic or otherwise religious and spiritual pursuits. One practice of sex magic is using sexual arousal or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise posited by sex magicians is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to transcend one's normally perceived reality.\n\nThe earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph, under the heading of \"The Mysteries of Eulis\":\n\nIf a man has an intelligent and loving wife, with whom he is in complete accord, he can work out the problems [of how to achieve magical results] by her aid. They are a radical soul-sexive series of energies...The rite is a prayer in all cases, and the most powerful [that] earthly beings can employ...it is best for both man and wife to act together for the attainment of the mysterious objects sought.\n\nSuccess in any case requires the adjuvancy of a superior woman. THIS IS THE LAW! A harlot or low woman is useless for all such lofty and holy purposes, and just so is a bad, impure, passion-driven apology for a man. The woman shall not be one who accepts rewards for compliance; nor a virgin; or under eighteen years of age; or another's wife; yet must be one who hath known man and who has been and still is capable of intense mental, volitional and affectional energy, combined with perfect sexive and orgasmal ability; for it requires a double crisis to succeed...\n\nThe entire mystery can be given in very few words, and they are: An upper room; absolute personal, mental, and moral cleanliness both of the man and wife. An observance of the law just cited during the entire term of the experiment -- 49 days. Formulate the desire and keep it in mind during the whole period and especially when making the nuptive prayer, during which no word may be spoken, but the thing desired be strongly thought...\n\nRandolph himself was greatly influenced by the work of English Rosicrucian and scholar of phallicism, Hargrave Jennings.\n\nIn the latter part of the 19th century, sexual reformer Ida Craddock published several works dealing with sacred sexuality, most notably \"Heavenly Bridegrooms\" and \"Psychic Wedlock\". Aleister Crowley reviewed \"Heavenly Bridegrooms\" in the pages of his journal \"The Equinox\", stating that it was:\n\n...one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous.\n\n...This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it.\nSexual techniques from Craddock's \"Psychic Wedlock\" were later reproduced in \"Sex Magick\" by O.T.O. initiate Louis T. Culling, a disciple of C.F. Russell.\n\nCarl Kellner, the founder of Ordo Templi Orientis, (O.T.O.), claimed to have learned the techniques of sex magic from three adepts in this art. Beginning in 1904, references to these secrets, Kellner, and the O.T.O. began appearing in \"an obscure German masonic periodical called Oriflamme.\" In 1912, the editors of \"Oriflamme\" announced:\n\n Aleister Crowley became involved with Theodor Reuss and Ordo Templi Orientis following the publication of \"The Book of Lies\" between 1912 and 1913. According to Crowley's account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX° (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him \"Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains.\"\n\nWhile the O.T.O. included, from its inception, the teaching of sex magick in the highest degrees of the Order, when Crowley became head of the Order, he expanded on these teachings and associated them with different degrees as follows:\n\nProfessor Hugh Urban, Professor of Comparative Religion at The Ohio State University, noted Crowley's emphasis on sex as \"the supreme magical power\". According to Crowley:\n\nCrowley wrote extensively on the topic of sex magick. Some of these works were published and made available to the general public, others were secret and could only be obtained by initiates of \"Ordo Templi Orientis\".\n\nAccording to Samael Aun Weor, Arnold Krumm-Heller taught sexual magic without ejaculation.\n\nMaria de Naglowska (1883–1936) was a Russian occultist, mystic, author and journalist who wrote and taught about sexual magical ritual practices while also being linked with the Parisian surrealist movement. She established and led an occult society known as the Confrérie de la Flèche d'or (Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow) in Paris from 1932 to 1935. In 1931, she compiled, translated and published in French a collection of published and unpublished writings by American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph on the subject of sexual magic and magic mirrors. Her translation and publication of Randolph's previously little known ideas and teachings was the source of Randolph's subsequent influence in European magic. She augmented the text with what she claimed were some of his oral teachings. The following year, she published a semi-autobiographical novella, \"Le Rite sacré de l'amour magique\" (The Sacred Ritual of Magical Love.)\n\nLater that year, she also published \"La Lumière du sexe\" (The Light of Sex), a mystic treatise and guide to sexual ritual that was required reading for those seeking to be initiated into the Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow. Her later book on advanced sexual magic practices, \"Le Mystère de la pendaison\" (The Hanging Mystery) details her advanced teachings on the Third Term of the Trinity and the spiritually transformative power of sex, and the practice of erotic ritual hanging and other sensory deprivation practices. Beyond occult subjects, Naglowska also influenced the surrealist art movement.

{"id": "1836327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836327", "title": "Internal Revenue Code", "text": "Internal Revenue Code\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code (IRC), formally the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, is the domestic portion of federal statutory tax law in the United States, published in various volumes of the United States Statutes at Large, and separately as Title 26 of the United States Code (USC). It is organized topically, into subtitles and sections, covering income tax in the United States, payroll taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, and excise taxes; as well as procedure and administration. Its implementing agency is the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nPrior to 1874, U.S. statutes (whether in tax law or other subjects) were not codified. That is, the acts of Congress were not separately organized and published in separate volumes based on the subject matter (such as taxation, bankruptcy, etc.). Codifications of statutes, including tax statutes, undertaken in 1873 resulted in the Revised Statutes of the United States, approved June 22, 1874, effective for the laws in force as of December 1, 1873. Title 35 of the Revised Statutes was the Internal revenue title. Another codification was undertaken in 1878.\n\nIn 1919, a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives began a project to recodify U.S. statutes, which eventually resulted in a new United States Code in 1926 (including tax statutes).\n\nThe tax statutes were re-codified by an Act of Congress on February 10, 1939 as the \"Internal Revenue Code\" (later known as the \"Internal Revenue Code of 1939\"). The 1939 Code was published as volume 53, Part I, of the United States Statutes at Large and as title 26 of the United States Code. Subsequent permanent tax laws enacted by the United States Congress updated and amended the 1939 Code.\n\nOn August 16, 1954, in connection with a general overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service, the IRC was greatly reorganized by the 83rd United States Congress and expanded (by Chapter 736, ). Ward M. Hussey was the principal drafter of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The code was published in volume 68A of the United States Statutes at Large. To prevent confusion with the 1939 Code, the new version was thereafter referred to as the \"Internal Revenue Code of 1954\" and the prior version as the \"Internal Revenue Code of 1939\". The lettering and numbering of subtitles, sections, etc., was completely changed. For example, section 22 of the 1939 Code (defining gross income) was roughly analogous to section 61 of the 1954 Code. The 1954 Code replaced the 1939 Code as title 26 of the United States Code.\n\nThe 1954 Code temporarily extended the Revenue Act of 1951's 5 percentage point increase in corporate tax rates through March 31, 1955, increased depreciation deductions by providing additional depreciation schedules, and created a 4 percent dividend tax credit for individuals.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was enacted in the form of a separate code by act of August 16, 1954, ch. 736, . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the name of the 1954 Code to the \"Internal Revenue Code of 1986\". In addition to being published in various volumes of the United States Statutes at Large, the Internal Revenue Code is separately published as Title 26 of the United States Code. The text of the Internal Revenue Code as published in title 26 of the U.S. Code is virtually identical to the Internal Revenue Code as published in the various volumes of the United States Statutes at Large. Of the 50 enacted titles, the Internal Revenue Code is the only volume that has been published in the form of a separate code.\n\nWith respect to the federal income tax on individuals, the 1954 Code imposed a progressive tax with 24 income brackets applying to tax rates ranging from 20% to 91%. For example, the following is a schedule showing the federal marginal income tax rate imposed on each level of taxable income of a single (unmarried) individual under the 1954 Code:\n\nReferences to the Internal Revenue Code in the United States Code and other statutes of Congress subsequent to 1954 generally mean Title 26 of the Code as amended. The basic structure of the Title 26 remained the same until the enactment of the comprehensive revision contained in Tax Reform Act of 1986, although of course individual provisions of the law were changed on a regular basis.\n\nSection 2 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provides (in part):\n\nThus, the 1954 Code was renamed the \"Internal Revenue Code of 1986\" by section 2 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The 1986 Act contained substantial amendments, but no formal re-codification. That is, the 1986 Code retained most of the same lettering and numbering of subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, etc. The 1986 Code, as amended from time to time (and still published as title 26 of the United States Code), retains the basic structure of the 1954 Code.\n\n\nSection 1 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes the federal income tax on the taxable income of U.S. citizens and residents, and of estates and trusts. The corporate income tax is imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 11.\n\nThe organization of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted in hundreds of Public Laws passed by the U.S. Congress since 1954, is identical to the organization of the Internal Revenue Code separately published as Title 26 of the U.S. Code.\n\nFor example, section 162(e)(2)(B)(ii) () would be as follows:\n\nTitle 26: Internal Revenue Code\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code is topically organized and generally referred to by section number (sections 1 through 9834). Some topics are short (e.g., tax rates) and some quite long (e.g., pension & benefit plans).\n\nKey IRC Topics By Section:\n\n\n\"(This is not intended to be a complete list of sections.)\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1836332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836332", "title": "Sylvia Rivera Law Project", "text": "Sylvia Rivera Law Project\n\nThe Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) is a legal aid organization based in New York City at the Miss Major-Jay Toole Building for Social Justice that serves low-income or people of color who are transgender, intersex and/or gender non-conforming. The organization was formed in August 2002 by attorney and transgender civil rights activist, Dean Spade. The project was named for Sylvia Rivera, a transgender activist and veteran of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, who died the same year that SRLP was formed.\n\nIn February 2002, Spade was followed into the bathroom by a police officer. In an essay about trans public bathroom use and bathroom bills, Spade describes his experience: \"As I was looking to see what stalls were open, he approached and asked for my ID. I explained that I was in the right bathroom, that I am transgender and I understood the confusion, but I was just going to use the bathroom and leave.\" The officer questioned his gender and arrested him. The court assigned attorney asked personal, invasive questions during the first meeting, which made Spade fear what the trial would hold: \"[Spade's attorney] came to the cell, read the police statement on my court documents, and asked why I was in the 'men's' room. I explained that I am transgender and I customarily use 'men's' rooms, and that I go by a male name and pronoun. He wrinkled up his face and said with a very dismissive and disapproving attitude, 'That is your business. I don't care.' He then asked me what my genitalia are.\" The charges against him were thrown out, but he was left with mixed feelings. He was upset by the transphobia that caused this to happen, but felt optimistic about what the media coverage may bring. Months later, he formed the Sylvia Rivera Law Project to help others who were in discriminatory situations like he was in.\n\nThe project has released this mission statement: \n\nThe goals of the organization are to provide access to legal services for low-income transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming people, provide public education and policy reform to end state-sanctioned discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression. The organization also aims to build a collective organization that develops the leadership of low-income transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming people of color while participating in the larger movement for racial, social, and economic justice. As Dean Spade himself puts it, \"Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) is committed to providing people with some basic services. We see providing survival services as central to our goal of building racial and economic justice-centered trans resistance.\" \n\nA large part of the group's work revolves around prison reform, as detention makes up the final step of the criminal justice system. SRLP has a variety of projects in the works, including advocating against solitary confinement, profiting off incarceration, and new jails being built in New York, as well as promoting safe healthcare for LGBT+ incarcerated folks.\n\nSRLP's organizers, lawyers and grassroots activists work on a variety of issues, including prison abolition, reform of gender-segregated facilities, and identity documents, as well as name changes, health care advocacy, ID replacement, criminal history, prisoner rights, access to gender affirming garments and hormones in prison, immigration relief such as asylum or U/T Visas, naturalization, and other legal and social services. \n\nMuch of the SRLP's work centers around legislative reform, especially surrounding prisons and what sends people there. Founder Dean Spade is particularly interested in the intersection of race and sexuality/gender expression, and crime related to these issues. As he puts it, hate crime laws \"focus on punishment and have not bee shown to actually prevent bias-motivated violence... Hate criminology laws strengthen and legitimize the criminal punishment system, a system that targets the very people that these laws are supposedly passed to protect. The criminal punishment system has the same biases (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia) that advocates of these laws want to eliminate.\"\n\n\n20-year-old transgender woman Alyssa Rodriguez was incarcerated at the Red Hook Residential Center under the Office of Children and Family Services in Dutchess County, New York. Under their care, Rodriguez was denied her hormonal treatment, and disciplined for her effeminate gender expression. SRLP, in association with Lambda Legal, won Rodriguez a substantial sum of cash, in return for the emotional distress imposed on her.\n\nSRLP members acknowledge that the system is the problem with regards to discrimination towards gender. Oppressed individuals must fight for their equality by sticking together, working towards this common goal of justice. This can only be done by themselves as the system has proved to be an unreliable source in maintaining equal rights for all individuals, regardless of race or gender. With this in mind, members work with all oppressed communities in obtaining the shared goal of equality. Members believe that this work will further equality for our community as a whole versus for simply one oppressed group. SRLP maintains an equalized work environment that does not place members in a system of hierarchy.\n\nGabriel Arkles, Pooja Gehi, and Elana Redfield, three lawyers employed by the SRLP, came together and wrote an article entitled \"The Role of Lawyers in Trans Liberation: Building a Transformative Movement for Social Change,\" in which they lay out ways that lawyers can impact the lives of trans folks, especially through legislation. A major theme of this article is that affording LGBTQ+ folks the same rights as heterosexual, cisgender folks is almost as harmful as our current system, since the problems lie within capitalism itself, nor just the difference in rights under capitalism: \"A legal strategy that merely extends existing rights and values to include gays, lesbians, bisexual people, and transgender people without looking at the racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and corruption that maintain capitalism will only protect the structures of empire that oppress poor people and people of color.\" \n\n\n"}

It is the only extant (living) species in the genus \"Comptonia\", although a number of extinct species are placed in the genus. \"Comptonia peregrina\" is native to eastern North America, from southern Quebec, east to Nova Scotia, south to the extreme north of Georgia, and west to Minnesota. The common name is sweetfern or sweet-fern (although it is not a fern), or in Quebec, .\n\n\"Comptonia peregrina\" is a deciduous shrub, growing to tall. The leaves of the plant are linear to lanceolate, long and broad, with a lobed margin; they give off a sweet odor, especially when crushed. Plants are monoecious with separate unisexual flowers. The staminate flowers grow in clusters at the ends of branches, and are up to long. The pistillate flowers are only , but elongate when the fruits form, reaching .\n\nThe species was first described, as \"Liquidambar peregrina\", by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in the second volume of \"Species Plantarum\". Further on in the same volume, he described \"Myrica aspleniifolia\" as a different species (with the epithet spelt \"asplenifolia\"). In 1763, he changed his mind concerning \"Myrica aspleniifolia\", and it became \"Liquidambar aspleniifolia\", and so in the same genus as \"Liquidambar peregrina\". In 1789, Charles Louis L'Héritier placed Linnaeus's original \"Myrica aspleniifolia\" in his new genus \"Comptonia\". In 1894, John M. Coulter transferred Linnaeus's \"Liquidambar peregrina\" to \"Comptonia\", and treated Linnaeus's \"Myrica aspleniifolia\" as a synonym. \"Comptonia peregrina\" is now the only extant (living) species in the genus.\n\n\"Comptonia peregrina\" is native to eastern North America, from Ontario and Quebec in the north, east to Nova Scotia, to Georgia in the south, and west to Minnesota. It tends to grow on dry sandy sites, and is associated with pine stands.\n\n\"Comptonia peregrina\" is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including \"Bucculatrix paroptila\", grey pug, setaceous Hebrew character, Io moth, and several \"Coleophora\" case-bearers: \"C. comptoniella\", \"C. peregrinaevorella\" (which feeds exclusively on \"Comptonia\"), \"C. persimplexella\", \"C. pruniella\" and \"C. serratella\". It is also a non-legume nitrogen fixer.\n\nThe plant produces a bristly burr that contains 1 to 4 edible nutlets.\n\nThe aromatic leaves (fresh or dried) are also used to make a tea. The Canadian author Catharine Parr Traill includes it in her book \"The Female Emigrant's Guide\" in a list of substitutes for China tea. \"When boiled,\" she notes, \"it has a slightly resinous taste, with a bitter flavour, that is not very unpleasant.\" Mistaking it, like others, for a fern, she says that it is in high repute \"among the Yankee and old Canadian housewifes (sic).\" The plant has also been used as a seasoning.\n\n"}

First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows a boy named Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father at the end of his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.\n\nGeisel conceived the core of the book aboard a ship in 1936, returning from a European vacation with his wife. The rhythm of the ship's engines captivated him and inspired the book's signature lines:\n\nAt least 20 publishers rejected the book before Geisel ran into an old college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book \"McElligot's Pool\".\n\nA boy named Marco, who is walking home from school, thinks of his father's advice: \"Marco, keep your eyelids up/ And see what you can see.\" However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines progressively more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He imagines the horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band.\n\nMarco's realization that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street leads him to imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and aldermen; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and a man with a ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, \"Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street.\"\n\nGeisel was 33 and had ten years of experience in cartooning, illustrating and advertising when he began work on \"Mulberry Street\". He had an established and prosperous career in advertising, including a contract with Standard Oil for Flit bug spray. Geisel's popular campaign featured the line \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" He had also made some forays into book publishing: for Viking Press in 1931 he illustrated \"Boners\" and \"More Boners\", collections of quotations from children's school papers. The book's positive sales encouraged Geisel to create his own children's book, which his advertising contract did not forbid. In 1932, Geisel wrote and illustrated an alphabet book featuring a collection of odd animals, but was unable to interest publishers in it.\nAccording to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel conceived the core of \"Mulberry Street\" in the summer of 1936 aboard the MS \"Kungsholm\", a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the \"Kungsholm\" endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with \"a stupid horse and wagon\". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, \"And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street.\" For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.\n\nThe Morgans based this account on interviews with Geisel, who had given similar accounts of the book's creation to journalists throughout his career, often omitting or altering various details. In one version, he had already been working on the book for six months before the European trip, and the trip home provided the final breakthrough. In another, he claimed he had the book about half finished when they landed in the US.\n\nGeisel, in his perfectionism, struggled with writing \"Mulberry Street\". According to the Morgans, \"Although he lived for wit, his flights of fancy were subject to strict review.\" He spent at least six months on the book, questioning every word and writing numerous drafts. He wrote the poem out in pencil on yellow paper and asked his wife to discuss every page with him.\n\nGeisel submitted his finished manuscript, originally titled \"A Story No One Can Beat\", to dozens of publishers during the winter of 1936–37. Publishers posited a variety of criticisms of the book, including that fantasy was not salable, that children's books written in verse were out of style, and that the book lacked a clear moral message. According to the Morgans, Geisel angrily exclaimed to his wife, \"What's wrong with kids having fun reading without being preached at?\" She cited the book's cartoon-like drawings and its story, which might be seen to encourage daydreaming and lying to one's parents, as possible reasons for its rejection.\n\nAccording to Geisel, he was walking down Madison Avenue in New York City after learning of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript when he got home, when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old Dartmouth College classmate. McClintock had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's President James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, but stipulated that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, \"If I had been walking down the other side of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today.\" In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.\n\nIn \"an act of faith\", Vanguard Press printed 15,000 copies of the book for its first printing. To promote the book, Henle bought a full-page advertisement in \"Publishers Weekly\", which reproduced the book's two-page spread of a reindeer pulling a cart and featured the line, \"Book publishers, hitch on! This is the start of a parade that will take you places!\" Approximately two years later, Vanguard printed 6,000 more copies. By 1943, it had printed 31,600 copies, and Geisel's royalties were no more than $3,500. Although Geisel later moved to Random House, Vanguard continued to publish \"Mulberry Street\" and his second book, \"The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins\", until 1988, when Random House bought Vanguard.\n\nThe book has received only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel agreed to a slight rewording, renaming the character who appears near the end of the story a \"Chinese man\" instead of a \"Chinaman\". He also agreed to remove the character's pigtail and the yellow coloring from the character's skin. However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines \"Say—\"any\"one could think of \"that\",/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat—/ Say, even Jane could think of \"that\".\"\n\nHearing of its release, neighbors of Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book would be an exposé of the people there. Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in \"The New Yorker\", which Geisel could still quote near the end of his life: \"They say it's for children, but better get a copy for yourself and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well.\" \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect.\"\n\nAnne Carroll Moore, then in charge of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an enthusiastic review in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book \"so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight\", and \"as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy.\" Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, \"What an amusing picture book ... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness ... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!\" Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, \"I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written from the point of view of my mind, not the mind of a child.\"\n\nWhile \"Mulberry Street\"s sales grew significantly as the Dr. Seuss brand became more famous, it is not one of Geisel's best-selling books. In 2012, on the occasion of the book's 75th anniversary, Michael Winerip argued that later Dr. Seuss books were more entertaining and inventive than \"Mulberry Street\" but that it is nevertheless important as a harbinger of the many books that followed. A. O. Scott, in a 2000 article in \"The New York Times\", contradicted this view, calling the book \"a hymn to the generative power of fantasy, a celebration of the sheer inventive pleasure of spinning an ordinary event into 'a story that no one can beat'.\"\n\nSome writers have focused on \"Mulberry Street\"s connections to elements of Geisel's life, particularly his childhood in Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel probably named the street in his story after a real-life Mulberry Street in Springfield. However, Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museum, contends that Geisel might have chosen the street mainly because of the sound and rhythm of its name. Lewis Nichols, writing in 1962 on the occasion of the book's 25th anniversary, largely confirmed this view, writing that in the book's creation \"there was no particular Mulberry Street in view, although there was one of the name in Springfield, Mass., where Mr. Geisel was born, and the subconscious may have taken him back.\" Other writers have pointed out that the motorcycles the policemen use to escort the parade in \"Mulberry Street\" resemble Indian motorcycles, which were manufactured in Springfield during Geisel's childhood. Cori Urban claimed that the mayor in the story resembles Fordis C. Parker, who was mayor of Springfield from 1925 to 1929.\n\nCharles Cohen notes that, while the book mentions the intersection of Bliss and Mulberry Streets, their real-life counterparts in Springfield do not cross. Cohen connects the horse and wagon in \"Mulberry Street\" to Geisel's Springfield childhood and points to precursors of it in Geisel's earlier work. He traces the blue elephant in the book to the blue elephants that appear in Geisel's comic strip \"Hejji\". Philip Nel acknowledges \"Mulberry Street\" as the start of Geisel's particular, distinctive verse style and theorizes that he may have learned \"the narrative power of meter and rhyme\" from books he read as a child, including \"The Hole Book\" by Peter Newell.\n\nJonathan Cott noted that \"Mulberry Street\" is similar to \"Der Erlkönig\", a German poem by Goethe, \"for both of them are about a father and a son and about the exigencies and power of the imagination.\" When Cott told Geisel about this, Geisel responded by quoting the first two lines of the poem, in German. He also noted that he was raised in a German-speaking home, minored in German in college, and had memorized the poem while in high school.\n\nMary Galbraith makes a connection between \"Mulberry Street\" and Geisel's fears about the spread of Nazism. Geisel conceived of the story while returning from a European vacation that coincided with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and Galbraith contends that in the book the \"mayor's small mustache and raised arm evoke Hitler, while the brass band and international cast of characters evoke the parade of nations at the beginning of the games\". She argues that the horse and wagon at the beginning of the story evokes the peaceful German Americans of Springfield, and by extension the non-threatening actions of Germany. As Marco's story evolves, the horse and wagon transform into a parade, which Galbraith equates with \"a military monolith ... marching down main street as an airplane drops confetti.\"\n\nSome analyses have examined the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father at the end of the story suggests to the book's young readers that \"it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults\", a message that appears again in \"The Cat in the Hat\". To Matthew Pierlot, \"The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth\", a Socrates-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more exciting than it is. To Patrick Shannon, \"Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world\". In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of Maurice Sendak and William Steig; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.\n\nPastoral theologian Herbert Anderson has written that the child's perspective of reality in \"Mulberry Street\" can be challenging and seem subversive to an adult. He argues that Marco's internal story of what happened on his walk was not dishonest or rebellious, but a natural \"openness to constructing a world\". The child's untruthful response that he had not seen anything interesting on Mulberry Street is not out of disrespect to the parent, but is Marco's attempt to reconcile his perspective with the authoritative, adult one of his father.\n\nNel notes that Geisel makes heavy use of anapestic tetrameter in \"Mulberry Street\" and many of his later books, citing the rhythm and draw of the books' language as a main reason for their appeal. Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in \"Mulberry Street\" and Geisel's other books, writing, \"Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can \"SHOUT!\" the lines; they can dance to the lines.\" Fensch marks \"Mulberry Street\" as the start of what he calls \"\"escalating sequences\" or \"escalating action\"\", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, \"The rhythm gallops—the pictures move from left to right, toward the next page and the action builds.\"\n\nGeisel's drawings formed a part of the narrative, bordering on the blending of text and image found in the much-denigrated comics medium. The artwork in children's literature before Geisel's appearance was much more restrained than Geisel's, and relegated to a lower status than the text it illustrated. By linking text and image, the book helps children follow the story even if they cannot read every word of the text. By encouraging children to explore the page, the drawings allow them to use their imaginations to fill in gaps in the text. The details shown in the pictures but not explained in the text creates a tension between them that leads the reader to think and imagine further. In the case of \"Mulberry Street\", Philip Nel writes, readers might be moved to ask questions such as \"Why is the elephant blue?\" or \"Where did the airplane come from?\"\n\nIn bold colors Geisel illustrated the surreal scenery and strange human and animal characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in \"Mulberry Street\", arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books to have a greater energy and looseness than in \"Mulberry Street\" or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as \"Horton Hatches the Egg\" (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's \"If I Ran the Zoo\" (1950).\n\nComposer Deems Taylor adapted \"Mulberry Street\" into an orchestral work, \"Marco Takes a Walk\". The work opens with a theme that represents the horse and wagon, which is followed by six variations that represent the various changes in Marco's story. The work's premiere, conducted by Howard Barlow, occurred at Carnegie Hall on November 14, 1942. \n\nAs \"Mulberry Street\" is Geisel's first children's book, Donald Pease calls it \"the scene of origin for all of Dr. Seuss's children's books\". After several books in prose, Geisel returned to verse for 1940's \"Horton Hatches the Egg\", using the same \"galloping, rollicking, anapestic tetrameter rhyme scheme\" he had used for \"Mulberry Street\". In a later series of children's stories for \"Redbook\" magazine, Geisel reported \"the latest news from Mulberry Street\". In \"Marco Comes Late\", Marco attempts to explain why he is two hours late to school.\n\nGeisel returned to fictionalized versions of his home town in three later books, which, together with \"Mulberry Street\", form what Donald Pease calls the Springfield Cycle. \"McElligot's Pool\" (1947), \"If I Ran the Zoo\" (1950), and \"If I Ran the Circus\" (1956) take place in different fictionalized versions of Springfield. Each also features a young protagonist who, when prompted by an adult, responds with \"a series of increasingly fantastic scenarios.\" \"McElligot's Pool\" also marks Marco's return as a main character in a Dr. Seuss book.\n\nWhen Geisel returned to Springfield in 1986 as part of a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street. Another group of children held up a banner that read, \"And to think that we saw him on Mulberry Street\". John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song \"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" was partly inspired by the book.\n\nIn 1961 the book was given the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1836387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836387", "title": "Levant Island", "text": "Levant Island\n\nÎle du Levant (), sometimes referred to as Le Levant, is a French island in the Mediterranean off the coast of the Riviera, near Toulon. It is one of the four that constitute the Îles d'Hyères. Part of the island is occupied by the naturist resort of Heliopolis the rest is under military control. \n\nIn the early Bronze Age the deposits at Petit Avis attest to the intermittent passage of man. Then in the Iron Age, in Liserot Cove, in the 7th century BC the occupation remains transient. It becomes permanent there only from the sixth to the fifth century BC. Then, after a long period of abandonment, it was inhabited again in the 1st century BC, Greek and Ligurian dishes were found on the island.\n\nThe island was part of the Greek colony of Massalia (modern Marseille).\n\nMonks lived on the island beginning in the 15th century; the ruins of their monastery still exist on the island. From 1861 until 1878, the island was a penitentiary for young offenders and orphans, of whom 89 died here. A plaque (located on the military part of the island) commemorates them.\n\nIn 1931, Gaston and André Durville, both doctors, established Héliopolis, Europe's first naturist village, on the island. As the doctors Durville said in 1931 \n\nThe island is , and located in the Gulf of Lion. About 90% of the island is reserved for a military missile test centre (the Centre d'Essais de Lancement de Missiles) which has launched numerous research and testing rockets since its establishment in 1948. The remaining 10% is open to civilians.\n\nThe village was built on hillsides and is dominated by Fort Napoleon. The village has a post office, a village hall, a chapel and a police station as well as a grocery, a bakery, and two galleries. The port area houses the office of the Capitaine du Port, a clothing store and small general store. In between there is a bazaar (Le Bazar d'Héliopolis) offering food, hardware, a tabac and cafe bar. There are a number of hotels and bed-and-breakfasts, and eight restaurants (Le Gecko, La Fourmi, La Palmeraie, La Gambaro, Héliotel, Le Minimum, La Pomme d'Adam, La Bohème), all catering for naturists.\n\nThe Bain de Diane and the Plage des Grottes (a nude beach) are reserved for naturists; nudity is formally obligatory there. Being nude is allowed (and expected) everywhere on the public area of the island, except in the immediate vicinity of the harbour. In the harbour, it is formally necessary to wear what the French jokingly call , often a pareo or a string. In conformance with the relaxed atmosphere of the island, this rule is not really enforced, but generally well observed. Inside restaurants outside the village centre, some clothing, although often flimsy, is often worn but toplessness (for women and men) is quite accepted there and \"le minimum\" considered sufficient attire; on the outside terraces, nudity is common, especially at lunchtime. At least two restaurants, La Fourmi and Heliotel, actively encourage customers to be nude, even at dinner.\nThe island sees a number of scuba divers; these generally do not partake in the nudist lifestyle.\n\nThe non-military part of the island is private property. The owners form the \"Association Syndicale Libre des Propriétaires à l'Île du Levant\".\n\nOutside Héliopolis naturist village, the other main tourist attraction is the Domaine des Arbousiers, a voluntary natural reserve of , established on 3 December 1993.\n\nThe island can be reached by boat from Hyères and from Le Lavandou. As no cars are allowed on the island (except for some four utility cars), these ferries do not take cars.\n\nA 1956 film by Werner Kunz was called \"Isle of Levant\" and featured so-called \"nudist camp\" footage.\n\nThe island is used as a setting in the Robert A. Heinlein novel \"Glory Road\" and in the Mario Reading novel \"The Music Makers\".\n\nThe island was mentioned in \"Are You Being Served?\" episode \"Hoorah for the Holidays\" as a presumed destination for Captain Peacock's annual vacation. Miss Brahms calls it \"a nudist colony\" but Captain Peacock insists it's a \"nature camp\".\n\nThe island, and a nod to its nudist history, was also featured in the French film \"Nos Futurs\" (Our Futures).\n\nIt was also the setting for a short story, \"The Reluctant Nudist\", featuring Leslie Charteris' character The Saint. \"The Reluctant Nudist\" appeared in the collection published as \"The Saint Around the World\"\n\nThe island was featured in an article titled \"'The Incompleat Guide to the Île du Levant\" that was written by Henry N. Manney III and illustrated by Russel Brockbank. The article appeared in the March 1964 issue of Road & Track magazine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1836389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836389", "title": "Die Hard Arcade", "text": "Die Hard Arcade\n\nDie Hard Arcade, known in Japan as is a beat 'em up video game released by Sega. It was the first beat 'em up to use texture-mapped polygonal graphics, and uses an extremely sophisticated move set by beat 'em up standards, often being likened to a fighting game in this respect. The game was published in cooperation with Fox Interactive and was a licensed product based on the \"Die Hard\" movie franchise. Because Sega did not hold the Japanese video game rights for \"Die Hard\", in Japan the game was stripped of the \"Die Hard\" license and published as an original property.\n\nSimilarly to hit action films of the time, \"Die Hard Arcade\" is dominated by over-the-top, largely gore-free violence which is played for comedic effect. Released in 1996 for arcades, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and the PlayStation 2 (Japan only) in the Sega Ages line in 2006. A sequel, \"Dynamite Cop\", was released for arcades and Dreamcast in 1998 without the \"Die Hard\" license.\n\n\"Die Hard Arcade\" is a beat 'em up for one or two players, who play as either John McClane or Kris Thompsen (Bruno Delinger and Cindy Holiday in the Japanese version). Players fight their way through waves of enemies, using their fists, feet, and a variety of weapons that can be collected from enemies or the environment, from household items such as brooms and pepper shakers to high-damage missile launchers and anti-tank guns. Most weapons are automatically lost at the end of each action scene, but hand guns can be retained so long as they have ammunition remaining. The typical level structure is a number of minions the player must defeat in many rooms, followed by a boss. Quick Time Events are interspersed between many of the scenes. Failing a Quick Time Event results in either a loss of health, as is usual for QTEs, or an additional action scene which the players otherwise would not have to complete. Cut scenes are interspersed into the action.\n\nThe Saturn version also includes a port of Sega's 1979 arcade game \"Deep Scan\", which can be used to gain extra credits. Unlike most arcade ports, no additional credits are provided for \"Deep Scan\"; losing a single life results in a game over.\n\nIn the English version, John McClane and Kris Thompsen (Bruno Delinger and Cindy Holiday) try to save the President's daughter, Caroline Powell from terrorists. There are a number of bosses on the game, including a biker called Hog, a Mexican wrestler named Jocko, the twin team of Mr. Oishi (a sumo wrestler) and Mr. Tubbs (an army general) and pairs of laser-shooting Spiderbots. The final boss, of which all the others are henchmen, is known as Wolf \"White Fang\" Hongo. At the end of the game, if both players are still alive, the two players will fight each other on the rooftop of the skyscraper to gain the sole appreciation of the President's daughter (similar to the ending of \"Double Dragon\").\n\n\"Die Hard Arcade\" originated as a means for Sega to use existing resources: Sega had produced an excess inventory of ST-V arcade boards, and had acquired the \"Die Hard\" license but as yet had no \"Die Hard\" games in development. The game was created by AM1 and the US-based Sega Technical Institute (STI), with all work on the game taking place at STI's facilities. AM1 provided the engineering, design, and art, while STI provided art, design and animation. \"Die Hard Arcade\" was the final game developed by STI before the studio was dissolved. Previews reveal that up until shortly before the game's arcade release, the gameplay was strictly two dimensional, with characters only able to move along a single plane. The game was developed simultaneously for the ST-V Titan arcade system and Sega Saturn, but the home version was released later.\n\nThe Japanese version of \"Die Hard Arcade\", \"Dynamite Deka\", was followed by a sequel titled \"Dynamite Deka 2\" for the arcade and Dreamcast. The sequel was released internationally as \"Dynamite Cop\". In 2007, a remake of the second game was released in arcades (on NAOMI) under the name \"Dynamite Deka EX\" in Japan and \"Asian Dynamite\" in Europe and the USA. Bruno, from the original Japanese version, later appeared as a solo unit in the 2012 crossover role-playing game, \"Project X Zone\", recolored to match his \"Dynamite Cop\" appearance in the Western releases. Because the character is based on John McClane, Bruno's likeness is modeled after Bruce Willis.\n\nReviewing the arcade version, a \"Next Generation\" critic said \"Die Hard Arcade\" \"breathes life into a dead-end genre\", as the fighting moves are effective and far more abundant than in previous beat 'em ups, even discounting the acquirable weapons. He also found the graphics \"lively\", but criticized that it is often difficult to line up attacks with opponents, and the action is sometimes glitchy or sluggish. It was Sega's most successful US-produced arcade game up to that time.\n\nReviews for the Saturn port applauded its flawless conversion of the arcade version, variety of moves and combos, and selection of satisfying-to-use weapons, while criticizing the low longevity stemming from its short length, low difficulty, and limited replay value. Most critics asserted that even mildly-skilled players would beat the game within an hour, even without using the extra credits that can be earned by playing \"Deep Scan\". Glenn Rubenstein of \"GameSpot\" disputed this, saying that most players would need credits from \"Deep Scan\" to have a reasonable chance of beating the game. Paul Glancey of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" was particularly enthusiastic about the weapons, commenting that \"there's not much to beat the thrill of smacking a terrorist right in his low brow with an antique grandfather clock.\" However, he stated that the game overall was \"a fun fighting game that's especially suited for novice players, but it's too short lived for more experienced beat 'em up fans.\" Sushi-X of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" was also less than impressed, concluding, \"Take away the humor, decent graphics and simple control, and you've got a bust.\" His three co-reviewers were more positive, with Crispin Boyer in particular calling the game \"the slickest rip-off of \"Final Fight\" I've ever seen.\" \"GamePro\"s The Rookie made little of \"Die Hard Arcade\"s low longevity, deeming the game a welcome offering to enthusiasts of back-to-basics beat 'em up gameplay. A \"Next Generation\" critic noted the longevity as a major issue but likewise gave a firmly positive assessment: \"\"Die Hard Arcade\" is designed for pure and simple action, and it delivers.\" Rubenstein similarly described it as \"simple, violent, and easy. Basically, it's a blast.\"\n\nGamesRadar ranked it number 25 on the list of the best Sega Saturn games, claiming that the \"wide array of firearms and melee weapons helped amp up the arcade-style action.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1836398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836398", "title": "Ecgbert of York", "text": "Ecgbert of York\n\nEcgbert (died November 766) was an 8th-century cleric who established the archdiocese of York in 735. In 737, Ecgbert's brother became king of Northumbria and the two siblings worked together on ecclesiastical issues. Ecgbert was a correspondent of Bede and Boniface and the author of a legal code for his clergy. Other works have been ascribed to him, although the attribution is doubted by modern scholars.\n\nEcgbert was the son of Eata, who was descended from the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this statement may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and not that he was formally taught by him.\n\nEcgbert was named to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the appointment to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government. An example of the brothers' co-operation is the fact that some of Eadberht's coins feature Ecbert's image on the opposite face.\n\nEcgbert's problems with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control as a way of making the family lands book-land and free from secular service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, the family would retain the use of the land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.\n\nThe school Ecgbert founded at York is held by the modern historian Peter Hunter Blair to have equalled or surpassed the famous monasteries at Wearmouth and Jarrow. The school educated not just the cathedral clergy but also the offspring of nobles. Blair also calls the library that was established at York \"a library whose contents were unequalled in the western Europe of its day\". Among the students at the school was Alcuin, who was placed by his family with Ecgbert. Both Liudger, later the first Bishop of Munster, and Aluberht, another bishop in Germany, also studied at the school in York.\n\nBede wrote Ecgbert a letter dealing with monastic issues as well as the problems of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the \"Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum\". Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's \"Pastoral Care\", and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.\n\nBoniface wrote to Ecgbert, asking for support against Æthelbald of Mercia. Boniface also asked the archbishop for some of Bede's books, and in return sent wine to be drunk \"in a merry day with the brethern.\" On another occasion, Boniface sent the archbishop a cloak and towel.\n\nEcgbert wrote the \"Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis\", which was a legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper procedures for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England after the death of Nothhelm in 739, it is possible that the \"Dialogus\" was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The \"Dialogus\" details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the \"Dialogus\" as not especially exalting monks above the laity.\n\nOther works were attributed to Egbert in the Middle Ages, but they are not regarded by modern scholars as authentic. These include a collection of church canons, as well as a penitential and a pontifical. The penitential, known as the \"Paenitentiale Ecgberhti\", was ascribed to Ecgbert by the 8th or 9th centuries, but its surviving versions have little or no content that can be reliably traced to Ecgbert. The pontifical, known as the \"Pontificale Egberti\", is thought to owe its attribution to Ecgbert's authorship to the fact that the penitential ascribed to Ecgbert was included within its contents. Lastly, the collection of church laws known previously as the \"Excerptiones Ecgberhti\" but today as the \"Collectio canonum Wigorniensis\", has been shown to be the work of a later archbishop of York, Wulfstan, and was not connected with Ecgbert until after the Anglo-Saxon period. Besides these Latin works, an Old English text, known variously as the \"Scriftboc\", \"Confessionale Pseudo-Egberti\" or \"Confessionale Egberti\", was once stated to be a translation from Latin by Ecgbert, but is now known to date from the late 9th or 10th century.\n\nEcgbert died on 19 November 766, and was buried in his cathedral at York. Ecgbert had a reputation after his death as an expert on canon law and church legislation, both in his native England and on the mainland of Europe. Alcuin also claimed that he was known as a teacher of singing. The historian D. P. Kirby described him as a \"great\" archbishop. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting stated that Ecgbert \"must be regarded as one of the great architects of the English church in the eighth century\".\n"}

While Lucerne Valley's \"town limit\" signs are within 2 miles of each other, the County Service Area Limits are much larger: in the west to Joshua Road (unpaved road east of Milpas Rd. on Hwy. 18), to the north at the height of Ord Mountain on Highway 247, to the south at the entrance to Cushenbury Canyon on Highway 18, and at Old Woman Springs Ranch as the eastern boundary. On June 11, 2013, Lucerne Valley and Johnson Valley were merged under the same Municipal Advisory Council, which serves as an advisory reporting agency to the County of San Bernardino District Supervisor concerning the region. On August 14, 2013, Johnson Valley was sworn into the same Municipal Advisory Council as Lucerne Valley. CSA 29's borders, however, remain unchanged from the move.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 105.6 square miles (273.5 km²), all of it land.\n\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Lucerne Valley has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Lucerne Valley had a population of 5,811. The population density was 55.0 people per square mile (21.2/km²). The racial makeup of Lucerne Valley was 4,507 (77.6%) White (66.8% Non-Hispanic White), 170 (2.9%) African American, 106 (1.8%) Native American, 90 (1.5%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 676 (11.6%) from other races, and 262 (4.5%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,447 persons (24.9%).\n\nThe Census reported that 5,780 people (99.5% of the population) lived in households, 31 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.\n\nThere were 2,176 households, out of which 685 (31.5%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 954 (43.8%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 280 (12.9%) had a female householder with no husband present, 157 (7.2%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 146 (6.7%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 14 (0.6%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 632 households (29.0%) were made up of individuals and 255 (11.7%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66. There were 1,391 families (63.9% of all households); the average family size was 3.28.\n\nThe population was spread out with 1,424 people (24.5%) under the age of 18, 452 people (7.8%) aged 18 to 24, 1,214 people (20.9%) aged 25 to 44, 1,780 people (30.6%) aged 45 to 64, and 941 people (16.2%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42.7 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.4 males.\n\nThere were 2,949 housing units at an average density of 27.9 per square mile (10.8/km²), of which 1,454 (66.8%) were owner-occupied, and 722 (33.2%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 4.3%; the rental vacancy rate was 9.0%. 3,800 people (65.4% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 1,980 people (34.1%) lived in rental housing units.\n\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Lucerne Valley had a median household income of $30,142, with 18.4% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\n\nThe majority of Lucerne Valley's zoning consists of Rural Residential, Resource Conservation and Residential zones.\n\nIndustrial zoning is predominantly in the southern border of the community on the north-facing slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\nThe commercial zoning corridor is primarily on State Route 18, with outlying businesses within a mile of the eastern half of the Old Woman Springs/Barstow Road junction. Commercial development is focused on mixed-use development, with storefronts facing the highway and a private residence on the same property behind the business on the same lot. Traditional retail construction has been restrained in the latter half of the 20th Century to keep the rural character of the town intact, but in September 2015 a Dollar General store opened as the first franchise grocery retail to enter town limits.\n\nAll residential zones are classified as Rural, Single or Medium density. Most housing developments are tract-based and were completed prior to the 1990s. No further tract-based construction projects have occurred in 20 years, with most new construction done individually on privately owned lots. An attempt to construct a golf course and install utilities for residential/commercial zones called \"Rancho Lucerne\" began grading north of the High School site before embezzlement charges filed against the financier caused the project to shut down in 2001, leaving the site abandoned and desert habitat destroyed.\n\nand water well drilling and export proposals. The majority of projects are to transfer local resources for statewide use. Projects include solar power plants (all state power plants are required to 'sell' generated energy to CalISO as a common carrier arrangement) as well as water for both direct use by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) and wells used for cooling solar plants. In 2012, LADWP cancelled an attempt to install a 2 mile wide water and power corridor in the southern half of the town.\n\nLucerne Valley Unified School District operates three school campuses run by Lucerne Valley Unified School District. Lucerne Valley Elementary School, built in 1952, is a 1/4 mile north of Old Woman Springs and Barstow Road and serves grades K-5. Lucerne Valley Middle School was built in 1986 on State Route 18, and formerly served grades 6-8. Lucerne Valley Middle School later merged with Lucerne Valley High School. Lucerne Valley High School was built in 1992 on Rabbit Springs Road east of State Route 247 and serve grades 6-12. Lucerne Valley High School offers athletics, FFA, and other activities for students. The high school's first graduating class was in 1995. The School District Office, Community Day School, and Mountain View High School have moved into the former Lucerne Valley Middle School site.\n\nThe Lucerne Valley Unified School District has had difficulty in recent years with financial issues, and lower than average test scores compared to San Bernardino County schools. The School District reported a student population of less than 800 pupils as of September 2015.\n\nSan Bernardino County requires cities and towns to be incorporated. Since Lucerne Valley is an unincorporated community in the county, services and local government responsibilities within Lucerne Valley are operated by the County itself.\n\nSan Bernardino County operates a Sheriff Substation and a full-time staffed fire station within town limits. The same Fire Station serves as the CSA 29 Field Office, which operates a Parks and Recreation Department to maintain the town parks, county facilities including two community centers and the county library, an ATSC TV Translator tower, and a public cemetery. Cal Fire also has a fire station east of the Town between Lucerne Valley and Johnson Valley. California Highway Patrol provides traffic enforcement and investigation.\n\nCSA 29 has started Digital TV service on August 2012 to replace existing analog channels on or around September 2013 by FCC Mandate. The licenses are to repeat Los Angeles Metro Area TV signals and utilize subchannels to deliver various broadcast stations.\n\nThe dry lakes and mountainous terrain surrounding the town have been used in Television, Film and Photography, including movies such as \"Stagecoach\" (1939) and \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (1977). On September 24–25, 2016, \"The Grand Tour\" on Amazon Prime shot an episode at Rabbit Dry Lake outside Lucerne Valley town limits.\n\n\n\nParks in the Lucerne Valley include:\n\n\n"}

The station is on the Chiltern Main Line between and stations. It is served by Chiltern Railways.\n\nThe original terminus station was built in 1854 after an original design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\n\nThe station had one platform and a train shed that covered two broad gauge tracks. On one side of the train shed was a single road engine shed and on the platform side were a booking office and waiting rooms (on the Birdcage Walk side). The walls of the train shed, an engine shed and offices were constructed from brick and knapped flint with slate roofs. This building remained as a station in use until 1864 when it became a goods shed. Between the 1880s and 1940 various additions were made to the fabric of the old station. The building received grade two listing in 1999 due to being one of only six remaining GWR train sheds. Following listing most of the later additions were removed, restoring the building to its original footprint, the only addition being the flat roof second floor extension added in 1940.\n\nThe dimensions and general design of the train shed, engine shed and office accommodation were repeated at with only the building materials different; Wycombe was built with brick and knapped flint wall while Thame was constructed from timber.\n\nA second through station was opened on the current location in 1864 with a second platform and, later, a footbridge. For two years prior to this date, after the extension to Thame had been made, all through trains had to reverse in and out of the old station which was not located on the new through lines. The design of the office accommodation on the newer station was a copy of the office accommodation on the old, with a canopy covering the platform rather than the train shed. The building was extended as least once at its west end.\n\nWith the building of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway in 1906 the station was again rebuilt to the design that is in use today, with four lines between two staggered platforms and a subway.\n\nThe station was originally the terminus of the Wycombe Railway line from , which was later extended to and , and then in 1867 was taken over by the Great Western Railway.\n\nIn 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway line was opened through High Wycombe, linking London with the two companies' lines to the north. Much of the current Chiltern Main Line is formed from this joint line.\n\nBritish Rail closed the original branch line to Maidenhead on 2 May 1970 and subsequently the track was lifted.\n\nThe station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.\n\nIn November 2005 a fire in the ticket office gutted the roof of the building. The restored station building reopened in September 2007.\n\nIn April 2015 the Northbound platform was lengthened. The subway was closed and has now been replaced with a footbridge with a lift at each end.\n\nAll trains are operated by Chiltern Railways. The current off-peak services are:\n\n\nHigh Wycombe has a bay platform, Platform 1, from which additional peak-hour local services run to and from London Marylebone. It is also used by a terminating weekdays only parliamentary service from West Ealing via the Greenford line. Until December 2018 it operated from London Paddington via the Acton-Northolt line.\n\nHigh Wycombe is to gain further rail links north of Aylesbury to Winslow and Milton Keynes by 2030 as part of the East West Rail project.\n\n"}
{"id": "1836449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836449", "title": "Titanium alloy", "text": "Titanium alloy\n\nTitanium alloys are alloys that contain a mixture of titanium and other chemical elements. Such alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light in weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, the high cost of both raw materials and processing limit their use to military applications, aircraft, spacecraft, bicycles, medical devices, jewelry, highly stressed components such as connecting rods on expensive sports cars and some premium sports equipment and consumer electronics.\n\nAlthough \"commercially pure\" titanium has acceptable mechanical properties and has been used for orthopedic and dental implants, for most applications titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium, typically 6% and 4% respectively, by weight. This mixture has a solid solubility which varies dramatically with temperature, allowing it to undergo precipitation strengthening. This heat treatment process is carried out after the alloy has been worked into its final shape but before it is put to use, allowing much easier fabrication of a high-strength product.\n\nTitanium alloys are generally classified into four main categories:\n\nBeta titanium alloys exhibit the BCC allotropic form of titanium (called beta). Elements used in this alloy are one or more of the following other than titanium in varying amounts. These are molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper.\n\nThe titanium alloys have excellent formability and can be easily welded.\n\nBeta titanium is nowadays largely utilized in the orthodontic field and was adopted for orthodontics use in the 1980s. This type of alloy replaced stainless steel for certain uses, as stainless steel had dominated orthodontics since the 1960s. It has strength/modulus of elasticity ratios almost twice those of 18-8 austenitic stainless steel, larger elastic deflections in springs, and reduced force per unit displacement 2.2 times below those of stainless steel appliances.\n\nSome of the beta titanium alloys can convert to hard and brittle hexagonal omega-titanium at cryogenic temperatures or under influence of ionizing radiation.\n\nThe crystal structure of titanium at ambient temperature and pressure is close-packed hexagonal α phase with a c/a ratio of 1.587. At about 890 °C, the titanium undergoes an allotropic transformation to a body-centred cubic β phase which remains stable to the melting temperature.\n\nSome alloying elements, called alpha stabilizers, raise the alpha-to-beta transition temperature, while others (beta stabilizers) lower the transition temperature. Aluminium, gallium, germanium, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are alpha stabilizers. Molybdenum, vanadium, tantalum, niobium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper and silicon are beta stabilizers.\n\nGenerally, beta-phase titanium is the more ductile phase and alpha-phase is stronger yet less ductile, due to the larger number of slip planes in the bcc structure of the beta-phase in comparison to the hcp alpha-phase. Alpha-beta-phase titanium has a mechanical property which is in between both.\n\nTitanium dioxide dissolves in the metal at high temperatures, and its formation is very energetic. These two factors mean that all titanium except the most carefully purified has a significant amount of dissolved oxygen, and so may be considered a Ti–O alloy. Oxide precipitates offer some strength (as discussed above), but are not very responsive to heat treatment and can substantially decrease the alloy's toughness.\n\nMany alloys also contain titanium as a minor additive, but since alloys are usually categorized according to which element forms the majority of the material, these are not usually considered to be \"titanium alloys\" as such. See the sub-article on titanium applications. Commercial (99.2% purity) grades of titanium have an ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa, equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. The titanium used for surface alloying of AISI304 stainless steel was CP-Ti, grade2, 300µm thick sheet.\n\nTitanium alone is a strong, light metal. It is stronger than common, low-carbon steels, but 45% lighter. It is also twice as strong as weak aluminium alloys but only 60% heavier. Titanium has outstanding corrosion resistance to seawater, and thus is used in propeller shafts, rigging and other parts of boats that are exposed to seawater. Titanium and its alloys are used in airplanes, missiles, and rockets where strength, low weight, and resistance to high temperatures are important. Further, since titanium does not react within the human body, it and its alloys are used in artificial joints, screws, and plates for fractures, and for other biological implants. See Titanium#Orthopedic implants.\n\nThe ASTM International standard on titanium and titanium alloy seamless pipe references the following alloys, requiring the following treatment:\n\"Alloys may be supplied in the following conditions: Grades 5, 23, 24, 25, 29, 35, or 36 annealed or aged; Grades 9, 18, 28, or 38 cold-worked and stress-relieved or annealed; Grades 9, 18, 23, 28, or 29 transformed-beta condition; and Grades 19, 20, or 21 solution-treated or solution-treated and aged.\"\n\"Note 1—H grade material is identical to the corresponding numeric grade (that is, Grade 2H = Grade 2) except for the higher guaranteed minimum UTS, and may always be certified as meeting the requirements of its corresponding numeric grade. Grades 2H, 7H, 16H, and 26H are intended primarily for pressure vessel use.\"\n\"The H grades were added in response to a user association request based on its study of over 5200 commercial Grade 2, 7, 16, and 26 test reports, where over 99% met the 58 ksi minimum UTS.\"\n\n\n\"This alpha-beta alloy is the workhorse alloy of the titanium industry. The alloy is fully heat treatable in section sizes up to 15 mm and is used up to approximately 400 °C (750 °F). Since it is the most commonly used alloy – over 70% of all alloy grades melted are a sub-grade of Ti6Al4V, its uses span many aerospace airframe and engine component uses and also major non-aerospace applications in the marine, offshore and power generation industries in particular.\"\n\"\"Applications\": Blades, discs, rings, airframes, fasteners, components. Vessels, cases, hubs, forgings. Biomedical implants.\"\n\n\nTitanium alloys are heat treated for a number of reasons, the main ones being to increase strength by solution treatment and aging as well as to optimize special properties, such as fracture toughness, fatigue strength and high temperature creep strength.\n\nAlpha and near-alpha alloys cannot be dramatically changed by heat treatment. Stress relief and annealing are the processes that can be employed for this class of titanium alloys. The heat treatment cycles for beta alloys differ significantly from those for the alpha and alpha-beta alloys. Beta alloys can not only be stress relieved or annealed, but also can be solution treated and aged. The alpha-beta alloys are two-phase alloys, comprising both alpha and beta phases at room temperature. Phase compositions, sizes, and distributions of phases in alpha-beta alloys can be manipulated within certain limits by heat treatment, thus permitting tailoring of properties.\n\n\nTitanium alloys have been extensively used for the manufacturing of metal orthopedic joint replacements and bone plate surgeries. They are normally produced from wrought or cast bar stock by CNC, CAD-driven machining, or powder metallurgy production. Each of these techniques comes with inherent advantages and disadvantages. Wrought products come with an extensive material loss during machining into the final shape of the product and for cast samples the acquirement of a product in its final shape somewhat limits further processing and treatment (e.g. precipitation hardening), yet casting is more material effective. Traditional powder metallurgy methods are also more material efficient, yet acquiring fully dense products can be a common issue.\n\nWith the emergence of solid freeform fabrication (3D printing) the possibility to produce custom-designed biomedical implants (e.g. hip joints) has been realized. While it is not applied currently on a larger scale, freeform fabrication methods offers the ability to recycle waste powder (from the manufacturing process) and makes for selectivity tailoring desirable properties and thus the performance of the implant. Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are two methods applicable for freeform fabrication of Ti-alloys. Manufacturing parameters greatly influence the microstructure of the product, where e.g. a fast cooling rate in combination with low degree of melting in SLM leads to the predominant formation of martensitic alpha-prime phase, giving a very hard product.\n\n\n\n"}

The line has been in operation since the 1840s between Glasgow and Greenock and was the first passenger service to follow the River Clyde to the coast. The line was electrified in 1967.\n\nThe line was opened by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway on 31 March 1841, and initially ran from Bridge Street railway station in Glasgow to a terminus at Cathcart Street, Greenock (later renamed Greenock Central railway station), with the section between Glasgow, and Paisley Gilmour Street being run by the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway. For the first time a railway took passengers right down the River Clyde, taking about one hour where Clyde steamers took around twice as long. The terminus was a short walk from Custom House Quay, Greenock, and the railway was very popular with passengers who boarded steamers there to visit holiday resorts down the Firth of Clyde or to commute in summer to their villas around the shores of the firth.\n\nOn 9 July 1847 the railway merged with the Caledonian Railway and became their main outlet to the coast. The Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway opened its branch line on 13 May 1865 with its trains being operated by the Caledonian Railway, but its steamer operations were slow to live up to their promise and when in 1869 the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station at Princes Pier, Greenock, the Cathcart Street station was effectively bypassed and the Caley lost trade. They had been trying for some time to organise an extension to Gourock, and having gained Parliamentary approval in 1884 they spent three years in construction which involved extensive tunnelling, and opened Gourock railway station on 1 June 1889. In August 1893 the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway.\n\nIn the 1923 grouping, the line became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The line was electrified in 1967, seven years after the North Clyde Line. The electric Class 311 trains were specially built for the line in 1967, although Class 303 trains were also used.\n\nAs of 2019, the line is mainly operated by Class 318s, Class 320s, Class 380s and Class 385s. The Inverclyde line uses the same Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway tracks as the Ayrshire Coast Line until Paisley Gilmour Street; although the two lines occupy different sets of platforms at Paisley Gilmour Street. From Paisley, the line heads to Port Glasgow station, after which it branches. The main route heads through Greenock to Gourock, where it connects with ferry services to Dunoon and Kilcreggan. The branch heads through the southern suburbs of Greenock to Wemyss Bay, where it connects with ferry services to Rothesay on the island of Bute (From 1 October 2015, for a period of 24 weeks, the ferry to Rothesay left from Gourock. This was due to essential improvement work being carried out at Wemyss Bay linkspan)\n\nFor most of the day five trains an hour operate each way on the Glasgow to Port Glasgow stretch, four of which run to Gourock, the other serving the Wemyss Bay line. The latter and two of the Gourock trains are express services stopping only at Paisley Gilmour Street and Bishopton (except for the 1725 ex Glasgow, which runs non-stop from Paisley Gilmour Street to Port Glasgow) between Glasgow and Port Glasgow, while the other two Gourock trains stop at all stations. This changes in the evenings, and after 8 pm only two trains an hour run to Gourock, with the Wemyss Bay train stopping at all stations.\n\nThe Glasgow Airport Rail Link to Glasgow Airport would have branched off from the Inverclyde Line near Paisley St. James station. In December 2006, the Scottish Executive gave the final go-ahead for the new link to be constructed; however, the project was subsequently cancelled in September 2009.\n"}

Realizing that he had been tricked, an angry Cartman arranges for Scott's parents to be killed and fed to him in a bowl of chili, and then has him insulted by his favorite band.\n\n\"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone point to this episode as a milestone in the series. The episode introduced significant changes in the characterisation of Cartman (like setting the standard for his psychopathic antics in the following seasons), and it also prompted the creators to only focus on one plot within an episode, as opposed to the show's earlier episodes, which involved several loosely related subplots. \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" was written by Parker, and directed by animation director Eric Stough. English rock band Radiohead guest star in the episode as themselves. \n\n\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" received widespread acclaim, with Parker and Stone listing the episode as one of their favorites on multiple occasions, and it is considered by fans and critics to be one of the best episodes of the entire series.\n\nAfter purchasing a handful of pubic hair for $10 from 9th grader Scott Tenorman, Cartman believes he has reached puberty and shows it to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. They tell him that he has to grow his own body hair, which angers Cartman. He tries to get his money back, but is repeatedly tricked and humiliated by Scott, who also steals an additional $6.12 and burns the money in front of Cartman. Kenny dies from laughing at Scott's actions. Kyle tells Cartman to move on, but Cartman is determined to get revenge. He attempts to train a pony at Mr. Denkins's farm to bite off Scott's penis, but Jimbo tells him it would be best to find Scott's weaknesses. \n\nCartman discovers that Scott's favorite band is Radiohead, and creates a plan to make the band members dislike him. Cartman writes a letter asking them to visit South Park, claiming that Scott is dying from cancer. Stan and Kyle tell Scott about Cartman's plan to get him bitten by a pony. Cartman gives Scott an invitation to a chili cook off and a ticket for a pony ride. After Cartman leaves, Scott tells his parents that there's a starving, abandoned pony on Mr. Denkins' farm. They go to save it that night and have it taken to an animal shelter. Scott and his friends cook chili for Cartman that is intentionally contaminated with pubic hairs. \n\nThe next day, Scott, Cartman and Chef bring chili for the cook-off. After they sit down to eat, Scott eats some of Cartman's chili, while Cartman scarfs down Scott's, much to the silent enjoyment of the onlookers (including Stan and Kyle), who are in on Scott's prank. As Cartman is finishing Scott's chili, Scott prepares to tell him the secret ingredient, but Cartman then reveals that he already knew, and the chili he is eating is actually Chef's. Cartman says that he told Stan and Kyle about his plan because he knew they would warn Scott. Cartman then announces that his actual plan was to get Mr. Denkins to shoot Scott's parents for trespassing. While Denkins was talking to the police, Cartman then stole the corpses, chopped them up and ground their body parts into the chili he fed to Scott. Scott finds his mother's severed finger in the bowl, vomits, and starts crying. Radiohead shows up and – unaware of what just happened – insults Scott for crying. They call him \"totally not cool\" and a \"crybaby\". They leave before Scott can explain what happened. Scott yells \"Wait!\" as they're leaving but they ignore him, making him more upset. As Cartman begins licking tears from Scott's face, Stan and Kyle agree to \"never piss him off again.\". Cartman waves to the camera and says \"That's all, folks!\" as the background from the Looney Tunes appears on the screen.\n\nAccording to \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" represented significant shifts both in the writing of the show, and the characterization of Eric Cartman. Although originally just an annoying, spoiled kid, Cartman got somewhat meaner over the course of the show's previous episodes. However, with \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\", he became \"the most evil kid in the world\", and got progressively darker throughout the series' run. The creators debated whether it was okay to have Cartman kill Scott's parents and feed them to him, as it was a \"crazy to do with a kid\", and would be setting a new bar for the series and the character. Eventually, after having debated the issue at length, the writers decided to go ahead with the idea. However, they found it very important to make sure that Cartman kills Scott's parents indirectly, without having to \"pull the trigger himself\".\n\nParker and Stone had also cited this episode as a milestone in the writing of \"South Park\", as the first episode to only have a single plot, without another subplot (that is, a B story or even a C story) to support the episode. The creators could only come up with the cat and mouse situation between Cartman and Tenorman, which they had described as reminiscent of the relationships in classic cartoons such as \"Tom and Jerry\" and Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. The creators feared that not having a subplot would negatively affect the episode, but upon finishing, they realized that a single, strong plot worked well. Since then, most episodes have contained just one plotline, or two strongly related stories.\n\n\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" was written by Trey Parker, and directed by \"South Park\" animation director Eric Stough. Whereas most episodes of \"South Park\" are done within a single week, writing on this episode began in the middle of May 2001, more than a month before the start of the season on June 20, and the episode was assigned a production code number of 501 (meaning the 1st episode of the 5th season). The early start was because the creators sometimes try to have one episode \"in the bank\" — meaning that they have \"at least half-start\" animating it. This way they can take off a few days during the two-month-long, demanding run, and then go back and finish work on the banked show.\n\nThe episode's first draft was written during the time when Parker and Stone were still finishing editing the last episode of their 2001 TV show \"That's My Bush!\" In its first draft, the episode's title was \"Scott Tenorall Must Die\", but Parker decided to change the character's name afterwards, as he thought that Tenorman sounded funnier. By the end of May, several drafts of the episode had been completed, and animation production had started. By early June, writing on episode 502 (which became \"It Hits the Fan\") started, and the creators decided to make that the season premiere. Before the season started, \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" was pushed back as the fourth episode of the run.\n\nThe episode eventually aired on July 11, 2001 on Comedy Central in the United States, after \"It Hits the Fan\", \"Cripple Fight\" and \"Super Best Friends\". The original broadcast of the show did not have a visible ghost of Kenny, when he laughed himself to death. This was added by the episode's rerun on the following Saturday. Minor modifications like this occasionally happen on \"South Park\", given the rush the creators are in when delivering the show on the day of its broadcast.\n\nThe script of the episode reveals some minor differences from the finished episode. After the long \"mad scientist\" scene of Cartman designing the plans for his revenge, it was supposed to be revealed that whatever he was drawing so intently was \"only a stupid crayon drawing of a pony\". In the finished episode, Cartman's drawing is not revealed; however, the pony drawing is featured earlier in the episode, during Cartman's briefing to the children. In the scene where Scott Tenorman burns the money in front of Cartman, the script direction said that Cartman should look like William Wallace in the 1995 historical drama film \"Braveheart\", at the moment he realizes that he was betrayed. Within the same scene, it is written that Cartman would fall down on the muddy lawn, and then use the mud to put war paint on his face.\n\nPrevious seasons of \"South Park\" were animated with the software PowerAnimator. The studio started using Maya from the fifth season on. The pubic hairs in the episode were scanned-in hairs from the back of the neck of Adrien Beard, \"South Park\"s lead storyboarder.\n\nThe members of the band Radiohead — Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway — provided their voice for their characters. The band was on tour in Santa Barbara, and Matt Stone drove there from Los Angeles to record their lines. While directing singer Thom Yorke, Stone told him to \"emote more\", as his acting was not exaggerated enough for animation voiceovers. Stone found it ironic to direct Yorke to put more emotion into his delivery, considering that Yorke is \"brilliant at emoting perfectly, exactly, in such a complex and beautiful way\" when he sings. The episode also features regular voice acting from Parker and Stone for most characters, as well as Eliza Schneider and Mona Marshall for female voices. Scott Tenorman's voice was provided by Toby Morton.\n\nScott Tenorman's favorite band is the British rock band Radiohead. When Jimbo does not know what \"a radiohead\" is, Cartman and Ned sing him part of their 1992 song \"Creep\". In Cartman's dubbed video, the band is interviewed on MTV by long-time MTV host Kurt Loder. Loder had previously been parodied in the fourth season episode \"Timmy 2000\". During one of his earlier attempts at tricking Scott into giving back his money, Cartman mentions that rock singer Courtney Love is in South Park, drunk and engaging in public nudity. Cartman's inspiration for the idea of having Scott's penis bitten off by a pony is the film \"Hannibal\", in which \"the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive\". \"Hannibal\", a sequel to the 1991 film \"The Silence of the Lambs\", was released a few months before the episode.\n\nWhen Cartman walks away from Scott after he tells him about the Pube Fair at Fort Collins, Cartman tells him \"Ha ha, charade you are, Scott,\" referring to Pink Floyd's \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" from \"Animals\".\n\nThe very ending of the episode, where the iris appears, is an allusion to the \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons, with Cartman assuming the role of the stuttering Porky Pig, delivering his signature line \"That's all folks!\" The use of the \"Looney Tunes\" ending has been seen as an ironic reinforcement of the fact that the episode's tragic plot has overstepped the established boundaries of cartoon comedy. It also has been viewed as a reminder about the fact that even the classic cartoons had \"a dark side in their own right.\"\n\nThe plot of \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" has been compared to that of the Shakespeare tragedy \"Titus Andronicus\", in which the humiliated protagonist also exacts revenge by feeding his enemies their own relatives. Some authors viewed the episode as not only an allusion to the violent Shakespearean tragedy, but an actual retelling of it.\n\n\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" is among the most acclaimed episodes of \"South Park\", and is one of the most notorious episodes, according to Stone. \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" is often regarded as the greatest episode of \"South Park\" ever made, and has frequently topped many \"Best of\" lists for \"South Park\" episodes including lists by WhatCulture, \"IGN\", and \"Kotaku\". Parker and Stone choose the episode as one of their eleven favorites in 2003, and one of their ten favorites in 2006. Fans voted the episode into the 2nd place in a major 2011 \"South Park\" voting held under the \"Year of the Fan\" promotion. The first place was taken by the tenth season episode \"Make Love, Not Warcraft\".\n\nThe events of this episode are given new meaning in the season fourteen episode \"201\", in which Scott returns as the leader of the Ginger Separatist Movement, revealing to Cartman that, while researching his revenge upon Cartman, Scott learned that his own father Jack Tenorman (a fictional Denver Broncos right tackle) had fathered Cartman with Cartman's mother Liane. This means that Cartman is responsible for his own father's death and feeds him to his half-brother in \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\".\n\nIn the 2009 video game \"South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!\", the player has to fight Scott Tenorman in a boss fight. In the 2012 game \"\", the player is able to control the four main characters of the show, who have to battle Tenorman and his army of gingers, as the kids travel through time.\n\n\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" was released on VHS in June 2002, along with the episodes \"It Hits the Fan\" and \"Cripple Fight\", on a video titled \"Insults to Injuries\". A DVD version of the compilation was released simultaneously, and also contained \"Proper Condom Use\", in addition to the episodes contained on the VHS release. \"South Park: The Complete Fifth Season\" was released on DVD in 2005. \"South Park – The Hits: Volume 1\", a DVD compilation which features Parker and Stone's ten favorite episodes, was released in 2006, and contains the episode. Parker and Stone provided short audio commentary for the episode on both \"The Complete Fifth Season\" and \"The Hits\" DVDs. \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" was also released as part of \"The Cult of Cartman\", a 2008 DVD compilation of Cartman-centric episodes.\n\n"}

{"id": "1836497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836497", "title": "Gopher Gang", "text": "Gopher Gang\n\nThe Gopher Gang was an early 20th-century New York street gang known for its members including Goo Goo Knox, James \"Biff\" Ellison, and Owney Madden born in England of Irish ancestry. Based in the Irish neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, the Gopher Gang grew to control most of Manhattan with their territory covering Fourth to Forty-Second Street and Seventh to Eleventh Avenue.\n\nThe Gopher Gang formed from various local street gangs in the 1890s, numbering around 500 members, into what later became a committee including Marty Brennan, Stumpy Malarkey, and Newburg Gallegher. The committee met semi-regularly at their headquarters known as Battle Row, a saloon owned by Mallet Murphy, to discuss robberies and divide profits from Manhattan bordellos and illegal gambling operations.\n\nGallagher became involved in a three-year feud with local bartender William Lennon in 1907, their dispute being over a card game, which resulted in several violent altercations between them. The first incident between the two required Gallagher to have stitches after Lennon had repeatedly slashed his face with a knife. Gallagher later claimed that Lennon had threatened to shoot him on sight and engaged him in several gunfights including an incident in December 1909 when Lennon wounded him in a gunfight between the two.\n\nOn May 17, 1910, he and Marty Brennan entered a saloon where Lennon was working. After another argument between the two, Lennon drew a revolver and shot Gallagher in the stomach (two of these bullets were still lodged in his body at the time of his trial). Gallagher and Brennan entered another saloon at Eleventh Avenue and Forty-Fifth Street where, according to Gallagher, they unexpectedly encountered Lennon who was now working there. Upon spotting the two gang members, he swore at them and apparently went for his hip pocket when Gallagher pulled his pistol and fired three shots, killing him. He and Brennan left the saloon and were arrested shortly after.\n\nCharged with manslaughter, Gallagher made a full confession, taking full responsibility for the killing, and claimed that Brennan had taken no part. The two were convicted and given long jail sentences. Gallagher, this being his first criminal offense, was sentenced to serve between 9 and 19 years imprisonment by Judge Foster on November 9, 1910. Despite his efforts, Brennan was also sentenced to 19 years due to a previous prison term in Elmira.\n\nIn the early 1910s the Gophers were led by One Lung Curran who was notorious for his attacks on lone patrolmen. Although most police rarely patrolled Hell's Kitchen, and only then in large groups, Curran often stole officers' uniforms and, after taking them back to his girlfriend for alterations, would wear the stolen clothes around the neighborhood. This encouraged other gang members to steal uniforms for themselves, becoming a sort of trend among the prominent gang members.\n\nThe gang began employing younger apprentice gang members such as the Baby Gophers and other gangs subordinate to the Gophers. These included the Parlor Mob, the Gorillas, and the Rhodes Gang as well as a female gang known as the \"Lady Gophers\", led by Battle Annie. The Battle Row Ladies Social and Athletic Club, as they were officially called, acted as reserve members of several hundred women for the Gophers in territorial disputes against rival gangs and as strikebreakers during the next decade. With the death of One Lung Curran in 1917, the gang declined in power, breaking up after most of the gang leaders were arrested by the end of the year.\n\nThe 2002 film \"Gangs of New York\" directed by Martin Scorsese provided a lightly fictionalized history of the Civil War-era origin of the competing Irish immigrant crime crews which dominated Five Points. The film explains the social tradition of enduring, if not actually shielding, Irish gangs in Manhattan's Irish-American neighborhoods.\n\n"}

Grabovski currently serves as an assistant coach for HC Dinamo Minsk in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Prior to his coaching career, Grabovski played as a centre in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 10 seasons.\n\nGrabovski was born in Potsdam, East Germany, where his father, Yury, worked in construction. The family returned to their native Belarus (then a Soviet Socialist Republic) when he was three years old.\n\nGrabovski was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens 150th overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft and played his first NHL game with Montreal on 6 January 2007 against the New York Rangers. He played three games in the NHL before being sent back down to Montreal's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. He helped them win the Calder Cup as AHL champions in the 2006–07 season. Grabovski was called up to play in a few games with the Canadiens during the 2007–08 season but did not see much playing time due to his low position on the team's depth chart. Grabovski recorded his first NHL assist on 20 October 2007, against the Buffalo Sabres and his first goal two days later against the Boston Bruins.\n\nOn 3 July 2008, Grabovski was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for the draft rights to Greg Pateryn and a second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. As a 25-year-old, Grabovski went on to finish his first full season in Toronto with 20 goals and 48 points, leading all NHL Eastern Conference rookies in scoring. The Maple Leafs rewarded Grabovski for his rookie season performance by re-signing him to a three-year, $8.7 million contract carrying an average annual cap hit of $2.9 million. His 58 points in the 2010–11 season was the highest among Maple Leaf centres since Mats Sundin's 78 points in the 2007–08 season. On 6 March 2012, Toronto re-signed Grabovski to a five-year, $27.5 million contract carrying an average annual cap hit of $5.5 million.\n\nOn 25 September 2012, due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout that cancelled the first three months of the 2012–13 NHL season, Grabovski signed with CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). When NHL play returned, following a 2012–13 season in which he recorded only 9 goals and 16 points in 48 games, on 4 July 2013, Grabovski was unexpectedly placed on waivers and listed to be bought-out by the Maple Leafs.\n\nOn 23 August 2013, as a free agent following his buy-out, Grabovski signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Washington Capitals. In his first regular season game with the Capitals on 1 October 2013, Grabovski scored a hat-trick in a 6–4 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. Grabovski completed the 2013–14 season with a respectable 35 points in 58 games as the Capitals failed to reach the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in seven seasons.\nOn 2 July 2014, as a free agent, Grabovski signed a four-year, $20 million contract with the New York Islanders. His tenure with the Islanders was largely affected by injury, with a lingering concussion ruling him out for the entirety of the 2016–17 season. Grabovski joined the Islanders along with his Maple Leafs linemate and friend Nikolay Kulemin, making it known to teams during free agency that they wanted to sign together.\n\nOn 21 June 2017, the Vegas Golden Knights selected Jean-François Bérubé from the Islanders in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft. Berube was selected with the condition that Grabovski's final year of contract be traded to the Golden Knights along with a first-round pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, a second-round pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft and prospect Jake Bischoff. On 14 September 2017, Grabovski attended his physical for the Vegas Golden Knights with the desire to play for the team. However, he did not appear in a single game for the Golden Knights.\n\nIn June 2019, Grabovski announced his retirement, stating \"I decided for myself that staying at home is not the best option. I need to do something. As a player I can no longer participate in games, so I want to try myself as a coach.\"\n\nOn June 15, 2019, Grabovski was announced as an assistant coach with HC Dinamo Minsk of the KHL.\n\nIn March 2008, after being a healthy scratch for a game against the Phoenix Coyotes, Grabovski left the Montreal Canadiens and flew to Los Angeles to consult with his agent. The incident prompted his trade to the Toronto Maple Leafs that summer.\n\nIn January 2009, Grabovski was involved a scuffle with fellow Belarusian Sergei Kostitsyn during a game between the Maple Leafs and Canadiens. The two had been in a feud since Grabovski's days with the Canadiens. Prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the head of the Belarusian national hockey program had to intervene in order for the two players to be able to coexist on the same team.\n\nOn 19 February 2010, Grabovski was arrested in Vancouver after becoming involved in a street scuffle. He was out of the Maple Leafs lineup with a broken wrist at the time of the arrest and was in Vancouver attending the 2010 Winter Olympics. Court documents alleged that Dylan Richardson was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by Grabovski, who then assaulted Richardson's wife by also punching her in the face.\n\nGrabovski inadvertently ended Chris Pronger's career when he accidentally hit him in the side of the eye with his stick.\n\nOn 9 February 2013, Grabovski was accused of biting Max Pacioretty of the Montreal Canadiens during a scrum along the boards. The NHL conducted a telephone hearing with the players involved, but could not determine conclusively if Grabovski had indeed bitten Pacioretty. However, on 20 May 2013, more than three months later, Grabovski admitted that he did bite Pacioretty, stating in an interview, \"He was choking me and I bit him. Don't stick your hands where you shouldn't.\"\n\nOn 3 July 2013, after learning that his contract was being bought-out by the Toronto Maple Leafs, Grabovski was very critical of Toronto's head coach at the time, Randy Carlyle, in an expletive-filled interview with TSN. \"I play in the fucking Russian KHL, I make lots of fucking points and what's going to happen? He make me fucking play on the fourth line and he put me in the playoffs on the fourth line and third line again,\" said Grabovski. \"I don't feel any support from this fucking idiot.\"\n\nSome controversy on Grabovski's nationality was discussed on the 7 February 2020 edition of the Toronto-based Overdrive sports radio show. Grabovski is known to be Belarusian despite the fact he was born in Germany; hosts Brian Hayes and Jeff O'Neill debated whether he should be considered of German descent, in regards to how many German nationals have played for the Toronto Maple Leafs. For the sake of the argument, Grabovski is indeed Belarusian, and should not be considered German.\n\nGrabovski has represented Belarus in international play. He scored four goals and was the first star in one game (against tournament hosts Austria) in the 2005 IIHF World Championship. Grabovski was selected to play for his country at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. However, he did not play due to injury. However, a few months later, he participated in the 2010 IIHF World Championship for Belarus. Grabovski was named captain of Belarus's roster on the eve of 2011 IIHF World Championship in Slovakia. In total, Grabovski has played in seven major international tournaments for Belarus.\n\nGrabovski and his wife Kate Van Alstyne had their first child, a daughter, on 30 December 2010. He missed the Maple Leafs' game against the Columbus Blue Jackets that night to be present at the birth. They had their second child, a son, on 6 December 2011. Grabovski and his wife called their son Jagger after The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. A third child was born 13 December 2017.\n\nGrabovski lived in Stouffville, Ontario, before transitioning to the bench in Minsk.\n"}
{"id": "1836501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836501", "title": "IND Fulton Street Line", "text": "IND Fulton Street Line\n\nThe IND Fulton Street Line is a rapid transit line of the IND Division of the New York City Subway, running from the Cranberry Street Tunnel under the East River through all of central Brooklyn to a terminus in Ozone Park, Queens. The IND Rockaway Line branches from it just east of Rockaway Boulevard. The A train runs express during daytime hours and local at night on the underground portion of the line; it runs local on the elevated portion of the line at all times. The C train runs local on the underground portion of the line at all times except late nights.\n\nThe line runs primarily along Fulton Street, Pitkin Avenue, and Liberty Avenue. The underground portion, which constitutes the majority of the line, was built for the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), opening between 1936 and 1956. The elevated portion in Queens was originally part of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)'s Fulton Street elevated line; the Elevated in Brooklyn was closed and demolished in stages with the opening of the subway line.\n\nThe following services use part or all of the IND Fulton Street Line:\nUnder Fulton Street, the line is mainly single level, except at Nostrand Avenue, where the express tracks are on the upper level and the local tracks are on the lower level. During the subway line's construction in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the old, now-demolished BMT Fulton Street Elevated (which the IND line replaced) had to be supported.\n\nThe stations along Liberty Avenue in Queens, from 80th Street–Hudson Street through Ozone Park–Lefferts Boulevard, as well as the current three-track elevated structure, were built for the elevated Fulton Street Line in 1915 as part of the BMT's portion of the Dual Contracts. This was the only section of the Fulton El that was built specifically to handle steel subway cars, as opposed to lighter wooden elevated cars.\n\nEntering Brooklyn via the Cranberry Street Tunnel as a two-track line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line travels east on Cranberry Street, then south on Jay Street. It becomes the Fulton Street Line at an interlocking north of Jay Street–MetroTech while briefly running parallel with the IND Culver Line. It turns away from the Culver Line onto Schermerhorn Street to the six-track Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station, which it shares with the Brooklyn–Queens Crosstown Line. The local tracks are unused at Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets, but connect to the abandoned Court Street station which is now the site of the New York City Transit Museum. At this point, the line becomes a four-track system until Euclid Avenue.\n\nThe line continues east under Schermerhorn Street to the intersections of Third Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, across them onto Lafayette Avenue and then finally onto Fulton Street until Broadway Junction.\n\nAfter Broadway Junction, the line leaves Fulton Street via Truxton Street, crosses Broadway, curves through a corner of the East New York Yard, crosses Jamaica Avenue and then south on Pennsylvania Avenue. It then turns east onto Pitkin Avenue until Euclid Avenue station. East of Euclid Avenue there are track connections to Pitkin Yard, and from either the express or local tracks to the two-track line towards Grant Avenue station. The four mainline trackways continue east on Pitkin Avenue, disused, and end at approximately Elderts Lane.\n\nPast Grant Avenue, the line joins the former Fulton Street elevated via a ramp as it enters Queens, swinging somewhat north until it is over Liberty Avenue. Here, it becomes a three-track line, with the center track coming from Pitkin Yard. Just past Rockaway Boulevard, the IND Rockaway Line branches southward while the Fulton Street Line continues over Liberty Avenue to its terminus at Lefferts Boulevard.\n\nThe Fulton Street subway was the city-owned Independent System (IND)'s main line from Downtown Brooklyn to southern Queens. Along with the IND Eighth Avenue Line, it was also alternately known as the Washington Heights−East New York Line. The groundbreaking for the line was held on April 16, 1929, at Fulton Street and Arlington Place, near the future Nostrand Avenue station. The line was opened from Jay Street to Rockaway Avenue on April 9, 1936, including the stub terminal at Court Street.\n\nTo allow the subway line to be built, the following streets were widened from being wide to being wide: Jay Street between Nassau Street to Fulton Street, Smith Street between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue, and Schermerhorn Street between Smith Street and Nevins Street. The land acquired to widen the streets was valued at $1.75 million.\n\nFurther construction was delayed by funding problems due to the Great Depression in the 1930s. This was temporarily solved by federal Works Progress Administration funding starting in 1936. The portion continuing from east of Rockaway Avenue along Pennsylvania and Pitkin Avenues to Crystal Street began construction in 1938. The next portion east from Crystal Street to around Grant Avenue, including the Euclid Avenue terminal and the Pitkin Yard, began construction in 1940. The progress lasted only a few years, as all work on the last portions in Brooklyn was stopped by December 1942 shortly after the United States entered World War II, with Broadway−East New York complete but not in operation due to lack of signal equipment, and the remaining stations to Euclid Avenue as unfinished shells.\n\nThe Court Street station was closed on June 1, 1946 due to low ridership and because of its close proximity to the Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station. After World War II ended, workers and materials became available for public use again. The badly needed extension to the more efficient terminal at Broadway−East New York (the current Broadway Junction station) opened on December 30, 1946.\n\nThe extension of the Fulton Street Line, the completion of which had been delayed due to war priorities, was finished by funds obtained by Mayor William O'Dwyer and was placed in operation on November 28, 1948, running along Pennsylvania Avenue and Pitkin Avenue to Euclid Avenue near the Queens border. Forty additional R10 cars were placed into service for the extension. The cost of the extension was about $46.5 million. It included the construction of the new Pitkin Avenue Storage Yard, which could accommodate 585 subway cars on 40 storage tracks. Because these stations were completed later than the rest of the line, they received different design features than other IND stations, including different wall tiles and fluorescent lighting. \n\nThe Fulton Street express tracks were not used in regular service until October 24, 1949. A trains began running express during rush hours to Broadway–East New York, with trains extended to provide local service. The express reduced travel time by five minutes.\n\nIn 1953, the platforms were lengthened at Ralph Avenue and Broadway–East New York to to allow E trains to run eleven car trains. The began running eleven car trains during rush hours on September 8, 1953. The extra train car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.\n\nIn late 1952, the Board of Transportation began construction on a connection between the IND and both the Fulton El and the Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, which included a new underground station at Grant Avenue. The connection from the 80th Street elevated station to the rest of the BMT Fulton Elevated was severed on April 26, 1956 and the IND was extended east (track direction south) from Euclid Avenue via the intermediate station at Grant Avenue, and a connecting ramp (known as the Grant Avenue ramp). The new service to Lefferts Boulevard began three days later. On June 28, 1956, the connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Rockaway Boulevard was opened.\n\nThe 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan called for the Fulton Street Line's Clinton–Washington Avenues, Kingston–Throop Avenues, and Van Siclen Avenue stations, along with 30 others, to undergo a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, improved signage, and improved station lighting.However, in April 2018, it was announced that cost overruns had forced the MTA to reduce the number of subway stations included in the program from 33 stations to 20. The stations to be renovated along the IND Fulton Street Line were among the 13 stations without funding, which will be pushed back to the 2020–2024 Capital Plan.\n\nThe IND Fulton Street Line was supposed to be extended farther east into Queens as part of the IND Second System, via an extension of the Fulton Elevated or a new subway. The line would have gone as far as Springfield Boulevard in Queens Village or 229th Street in Cambria Heights, both near the Nassau County border. The line would have also had a spur to the Rockaways.\n\nThe 1929 Second System plan suggested recapturing and extending the Fulton elevated along Liberty, Brinkerhoff and Hollis Avenues to Springfield Boulevard, near Hempstead Turnpike, Belmont Park, and the Queens Village LIRR Station. The 1939 plan, meanwhile, proposed extending the subway along Pitkin Avenue to Cross Bay Boulevard in South Ozone Park, then along Linden Boulevard to Cambria Heights near the Cross Island Parkway. A spur would have branched off east of Cross Bay Boulevard, turning south to join with the former Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (now the IND Rockaway Line). This extended Fulton Street Line would have also facilitated service from the planned Second Avenue Subway via a river tunnel from Lower Manhattan to the then-terminal station at Court Street.\n\nIn a 1940 plan, which was revised in 1945, the IND Fulton Street Line would connect to the IND Rockaway Line in a similar manner to the 1939 plan, via an extension of the subway under Pitkin Avenue. The line, east of Euclid Avenue, would be 4 tracks, with local stations at 76th Street and 84th Street, and an express station at Cross Bay Boulevard. At Cross Bay Boulevard, a flying junction would let the local tracks cross over to the inside and the express tracks cross over to the outside. The layout would be similar to that of Manhattan's 168th Street station. East of Cross Bay Boulevard, another flying junction would bring a two-track branch over the line to a pair of portals north of Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station. Meanwhile, the Fulton Street Line's four tracks would merge into two tracks, and end at 105th Street (today's Aqueduct Racetrack), where a scissors crossover would be present just west of the station. Crossovers would also be located between the local and express pair of tracks east of 76th Street, and between the two express tracks east of Cross Bay Boulevard.\n\nCurrently the line ends at Lefferts Boulevard in Ozone Park (the former end of the Fulton El), and only the Rockaway extension was completed. The mainline tracks that go past the Euclid Avenue station were to be part of a 4-track line to Cambria Heights.\n\n"}

The man lures Vidocq into a furnace room at a glass factory, and pushes him into the furnace. Hanging onto the ledge, Vidocq asks him to reveal his face. The masked man obliges, and Vidocq lets go, falling into the fire.\n\nJournalist Étienne Boisset goes to Vidocq's colleague, Nimier, asking for background to help write Vidocq's biography. Boisset states that he plans to find Vidocq's murderer. Nimier tells him that Lautrennes, Paris' chief of police, asked the pair to investigate the deaths of Belmont and Veraldi, the owners of a cannon factory. Lautrennes believes this is an attempt to undermine the French military. Belmont and Veraldi had died in a lightning strike, but during the investigation, Vidocq and Nimier see the powder on a factory worker's clothes catch fire. They interrogate the servant responsible for maintaining Belmont's and Veraldi's suits, who confesses that he received a letter, with cash, ordering him not to clean their jackets. The investigators realize that the lightning would need to be attracted to the men and find metallic pins, decorated with monkey heads, inserted into their hats.\n\nLautrennes orders one of his men, Tauzet, to investigate Vidocq's death.\n\nBoisset sneaks into Nimier's office and retrieves the monkey-head pins. He traces the design to Preah, a dancer in a brothel, and Vidocq's lover. She tells him that Vidocq also tracked her down, and that she told Vidocq that she received a letter, with cash, asking her to put the pins in the hats. She also reveals that the letter included a third targetErnest Lafitte, owner of an orphanage. Preah says that Vidocq rushed to save Lafitte, but the masked murderer got there first. Vidocq pursued the murderer, who seemed to possess magical powers and a mask made from a strange reflective surface.\n\nBoisset's investigation leads him to Sylvia, the brothel manager, a journalist named Froissard who is investigating the masked murderer, and Marine Lafitte, wife of Ernest. They reveal that Lafitte, Belmont and Veraldi were narcissists, committed to preventing death by aging. A man with a mirror mask, called the Alchemist, offered them an elixir of eternal youth in return for their cooperation in capturing young maidens for his experiments. The three rich men went along, but later stopped cooperating due to a sense of guilt, so the Alchemist killed them. After Boisset leaves, the Alchemist arrives, killing Froissard and Marine.\n\nBoisset's investigation attracts the attention of Tauzet, who notices that the Alchemist is disposing of witnesses, and fears Boisset is next.\n\nBoisset sneaks in to retrieve Vidocq's notes, where he encounters Lautrennes and Tauzet. Lautrennes attempts to arrest Boisset, but the journalist escapes. The notes reveal that Vidocq found the Alchemist's lab, where he was using the maidens' blood to create a magic substance for his mask, which grants eternal youth by sucking the souls out of his victims. The Alchemist arrived and attacked Vidocq, who managed to take a piece from the Alchemist's mask before the killer escaped. Vidocq's final note states that the Alchemist would need someone to manufacture the mirrored mask, leading him to the glass factory.\n\nBoisset, Nimier and Preah head to the factory, ushered by an artisan, and closely trailed by both Tauzet and Lautrennes. Just as Boisset declares there are no more leads and witnesses, the artisan removes his prosthetic, revealing himself to be Vidocq. It turns out Vidocq had jumped into a secret hole in the furnace wall, which he saw in the reflection of the mirror mask before the Alchemist's reveal to be Boisset himself. Vidocq then admits to faking his own death simply to let Boisset's guard down, as he knows the Alchemist would destroy all clues and witnesses through any means necessary.\n\nWith his cover blown, Boisset lets out a monstrous roar, and dons the Alchemist's mirror mask. Nimier opens fire, but is killed as the Alchemist magically reflects the bullets back at him. Vidocq pursues the Alchemist into a hall of mirrors, where he forces the Alchemist to look into a mirror shard, freeing all the souls trapped inside the mask. Vidocq impales the Alchemist with a shard of mirror and throws him into a river. Although the others insist the Alchemist is dead, Vidocq is unnerved by the lack of a body.\n\nAt Nimier's funeral, as the characters walk away, the Alchemist's laugh can be heard in the distance, accompanied by the glimmer of his mirror mask.\n\n\nThe film featured 800 shots modified in post-production over a period of eight months, for a cost of over €20 million. As the final PAL DVD release shows, the film was shot 25i (interlaced), and only special effects shots were deinterlaced by means of \"smart field blending\" (imitating a progressive-type amount of motion blur due to a different shutter speed of progressive modes) during post-production, as the special effects crew obviously was in demand of progressive frames which are easier to process for special effects, before for the final release all normal shots were deinterlaced by means of simple \"line interpolation\" instead. The result are video-like appearance of motions in normal shots, and distinctive film-like motions for all effect shots due to the different amount of motion blur resulting from the different deinterlacing methods.\n\n\n"}

He joined the Parachute Regiment in 1972, and was promoted to major serving with 10 Para in 1975.\n\nOn 28-29 May 1982, at the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War, Keeble assumed command of the 2nd Battalion of The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) after its Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel H. Jones, had fallen in action. A devout Christian, Keeble, then a Major, took over the leadership of the battalion at a point when its attack upon the Argentine Army position had broken down, having lost 16% of its strength as casualties; it was short of ammunition, had been without sleep for 40 hours, and was in a debilitated condition to face the unknown potential of a counter-attack from the Argentine forces present in the vicinity. After kneeling alone in prayer amongst the burning gorse seeking guidance as to what to do, Keeble conceived the idea of refraining from more attacks to try a psychological ploy, subsequently releasing several captured Argentine prisoners of war in the direction of their Goose Green garrison, carrying messages into it requiring its surrender or threatening it with a fictitious large-scale assault by the British forces, supported by artillery. The Argentine commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ítalo Piaggi, subsequently surrendered the garrison to the Parachute Regiment without further fighting.\n\nAfter the battle, despite popular sentiment among the soldiers of 2 PARA for him to remain in command, but he was replaced by Lt. Col. David Chaundler, who was flown in from the United Kingdom to take command of the battalion. At the end of the conflict Keeble was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order. \n\nHe then commanded 15 PARA, a Territorial Army Battalion based in Scotland, with its HQ in Glasgow. Keeble finished his military career with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 27 September 1987, his final appointment having been a Staff Officer Grade 1 at Allied Forces Central Europe in the Netherlands.\n\nAfter retiring from the British Army he set up a management consultancy, providing instruction on balancing the \"Ethic of business transformation with the Ethic of peoples’ flourishing\".

Negotiations were concluded on February 26, 1876.\n\nIn January 1864, King Cheoljong died without an heir and Gojong ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, King Gojong was too young and the new king's father, Yi Ha-ŭng, became the Daewongun or lord of the great court, and ruled Korea in his son's name. Originally the term Daewongun referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne. The Daewongun initiated reforms to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the \"yangban\" class.\n\nEven before the nineteenth century, the Koreans had only maintained diplomatic relations with its suzerain China and with neighboring Japan. Foreign trade was mainly limited to China conducted at designated locations along the China–Korea border, and with Japan through the Waegwan in Pusan. By the mid-nineteenth century Westerners had come to refer to Korea as the \"Hermit Kingdom\". The Daewongun was determined to continue Korea's traditional isolationist policy and to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation. The disastrous events occurring in China, including the First (1840–1842) and Second Opium wars (18561860), reinforced his determination to separate Korea from the rest of the world.\n\nFrom the early to mid-nineteenth century Western vessels began to make frequent appearances in Korean waters, surveying sea routes and seeking trade. The Korean government was extremely wary and referred to these vessels as \"strange-looking ships.\" Consequently, several incidents took place. In June 1832, a ship from the British India Company, the \"Lord Amherst\", appeared off the coast of Hwanghae Province seeking trade but was refused. In June 1845 another British warship, , surveyed the coast of Cheju-do and Chŏlla province. The following month the Korean government filed a protest with British authorities in Guangzhou through the Chinese government. In June 1846, three French warships dropped anchor off the coast of Chungcheong Province and conveyed a letter protesting persecution of Catholics in the country. In April 1854, two armed Russian vessels sailed along the eastern coast of Hamgyong Province, causing some deaths and injuries among the Koreans they encountered. The incident prompted the Korean government to issue a ban forbidding the people of the province from having any contact with foreign vessels. In January and July 1866, ships manned by the German adventurer Ernst J. Oppert appeared off the coast of Chungcheong Province, seeking trade. In August 1866, an American merchant ship, the \"General Sherman\", appeared off the coast of Pyongan Province, steaming along the Taedong River to the provincial capital of Pyongyang, and asked permission to trade. Local officials refused to enter into trade talks and demanded the ship's departure. A Korean official was then taken hostage aboard the vessel and its crew members fired guns at enraged Korean officials and civilians onshore. The crew then landed ashore and plundered the town in the process killing seven Koreans. The governor of the province Pak Kyu-su ordered his forces to destroy the ship. In the event the General Sherman ran aground on a sandbar and Korean forces burned the ship and killed the ship's entire crew of 23. In 1866 after the execution of several of its Catholic missionaries and Korean Catholics, the French launched a punitive expedition against Korea. Five years later in 1871, the Americans also launched an expedition to Korea. Despite this, the Koreans continued to adhere to isolationism and refused to negotiate to open up the country.\n\nDuring the Edo period, Japan's relations and trade with Korea were conducted through intermediaries with the Sō family in Tsushima. A Japanese outpost called the \"waegwan\" was allowed to be maintained in Tongnae near Pusan. The traders were confined to the outpost and no Japanese were allowed to travel to the Korean capital at Seoul. During the aftermath of the Meiji restoration in late 1868, a member of the Sō daimyō informed the Korean authorities that a new government had been established and an envoy would be sent from Japan. In 1869 the envoy from the Meiji government arrived in Korea carrying a letter requesting to establish a goodwill mission between the two countries; the letter contained the seal of the Meiji government rather than the seals authorized by the Korean Court for the Sō family to use. It also used the character \"ko\" (皇) rather than \"taikun\" (大君) to refer to the Japanese emperor. The Koreans only used this character only to refer to the Chinese emperor, and to the Koreans it implied ceremonial superiority to the Korean monarch which would make the Korean monarch a vassal or subject of the Japanese ruler. The Japanese were however just reacting to their domestic political situation where the Shogun had been replaced by the emperor. The Koreans remained in the sinocentric world where China was at the centre of interstate relations and as a result refused to receive the envoy. The bureau of foreign affairs wanted to change these arrangements to one based on modern state-to-state relations.\n\nIn Korea, Heungseon Daewongun, who instituted a policy of closing doors to European powers, was forced into retirement by his son King Gojong and Gojong's wife, Empress Myeongseong. France and the United States had already made several unsuccessful attempts to begin commerce with the Joseon dynasty during Heungseon Daewongun's era. However, after he was removed from power, many new officials who supported the idea of opening commerce with foreigners took power. While there was political instability, Japan developed a plan to open and exert influence on Korea before a European power could. In 1875, their plan was put into action: the \"Un'yō\", a small Japanese warship under the command of Inoue Yoshika, was dispatched to present a show of force and survey coastal waters without Korean permission.\n\nOn September 20, the ship reached Ganghwa Island, which had been a site of violent confrontations between Korean forces and foreign forces in the previous decade. In 1866, the island was briefly occupied by the French, and also in 1871 subject to American intervention. The memories of those confrontations were very fresh, and there was little question that the Korean garrison would shoot at any approaching foreign ship. Nonetheless, Commander Inoue ordered a small boat launched – allegedly in search of drinkable water. The Korean forts opened fire. The \"Un'yō\" brought its superior firepower to bear and silenced the Korean guns. Then it attacked another Korean fort on Yeongjong Island and withdrew back to Japan.\n\nJapan employed gunboat diplomacy to press Korea to sign this unequal treaty. The pact opened up Korea, as Commodore Matthew Perry's fleet of Black Ships had opened up Japan in 1853. According to the treaty, it ended Joseon's status as a tributary state of the Qing dynasty and opened three ports to Japanese trade. The Treaty also granted the Japanese people many of the same rights in Korea that Westerners enjoyed in Japan, such as extraterritoriality.\n\nThe chief treaty negotiators were Kuroda Kiyotaka, Director of the Hokkaidō Colonization Office, and Shin Heon, General/Minister of Joseon-dynasty Korea.\n\nThe articles of the treaty were as follows:\n\nThe following year saw a Japanese fleet led by Special Envoy Kuroda Kiyotaka coming over to Joseon, demanding an apology from the Korean government and a commercial treaty between the two nations. The Korean government decided to accept the demand, in hope of importing some technologies to defend the country from any future invasions.\n\nHowever, the treaty would eventually turn out to be the first of many unequal treaties signed by Korea; It gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea, and forced the Korean government to open 3 ports to Japan, specifically Busan, Incheon and Wonsan. With the signing of its first unequal treaty, Korea became vulnerable to the influence of imperialistic powers; and later the treaty led Korea to be annexed by Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

The song was inspired by a boy who saw everything from a \"beauty point of view\".\n\n\"Venus as a Boy\" features a musical ensemble made up of Indian instruments like tablas. The song received mixed reviews from critics, who discussed Björk's musical shift. Despite becoming a chart-topping hit in Björk's native Iceland, the song did not chart well internationally apart from managing to enter the UK Singles Chart top 30.\n\nThe accompanying music video was directed by the British music video director Sophie Muller. The clip shows Björk in a kitchen cooking eggs, and was inspired by the singer's favorite book \"Story of the Eye\". Björk performed the song on different TV appearances, including \"Top of the Pops\", and sang it during the course of her Debut Tour.\n\nThe song was later chosen by fans to be included in her greatest hits album, \"Greatest Hits\", and also appeared in her \"Family Tree\" Box Set which contained a \"greatest hits\" disc on which the songs were chosen by Björk. In 2003, \"Q Magazine\" ranked \"Venus as a Boy\" at number 610 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".\n\nThere have been more than 30 cover versions of \"Venus as a Boy\" by other artists.\n\nThe song was written by Björk and was produced by Nellee Hooper. It was one of the last tracks to be recorded for the album.\nThe song was inspired by a \"specific person\" but Björk never revealed who it was. Although, it is supposed that this specific person is Dominic Thrupp (also known as Dom T.) with whom Björk had a relationship at the time of writing. Moreover, the song talks about a boy who saw everything from a \"beauty point of view, and not superficial beauty but the beauty of brushing your teeth and the beauty of waking up in the morning in the right beat and the beauty of having a conversation with a person.\" as revealed by the singer.\n\nThe B-sides were \"Stígðu Mig\" (\"\"Step Me\"\"), a song originally recorded by The Elgar Sisters; a group formed in the early eighties by guitarist Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and Björk, written by Björk, Óttarsson and Thór Eldon. The other B-side is \"I Remember You\", a cover of the classic love song written by Victor Schertzinger and Johnny Mercer, that was recorded together with \"Like Someone in Love\", but didn't make the last cut as the latter. In both songs Corky Hale plays the Harp.\n\nBjörk described the composition of the song in an interview with David Hemingway: \n\nBjörk played keyboards in the song: \"I don't use samplers much. I will usually gather soundbanks for each album and will then play them in on keyboards. This applies for simpler beats in songs like Venus as a Boy\". She is also responsible for the bassline, in an interview where she described her collaboration with Timbaland she said: \"He was a big fan of Venus as a Boy, the Bollywood strings and I remember him coming up to me at a party and saying he loved the bassline in that song and I felt pretty chuffed because I wrote that!\"\n\nThe song is influenced by different genres, like chillout, avant-garde and jazz. Since Björk wanted the album to sound like an Indian soundtrack, many tracks including \"One Day\", \"Come to Me\" and the same \"Venus as a Boy\" features Indian instruments. The strings were recorded by Talvin Singh in Bombay. The track heavily uses a vibraphone.\n\nThe track received mixed reviews from music critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic complimented the song and its lyrics, stating that \"the album's romantic moments may be its most striking; \"Venus as a Boy\" fairly swoons with twinkly vibes and lush strings, and Björk's vocals and lyrics -- \"His wicked sense of humor/Suggests exciting sex\"—are sweet and just the slightest bit naughty\". A less flattering review came from \"Rolling Stone\" reviewer Tom Graves, who discussed the singer's shift from rock to alternative music, commenting that the Indian orchestra in \"Come to Me\" and \"Venus as a Boy\" \"[is] more intrusive than galvanizing\". On a similar note, Kate Narburgh of The Chronicle, citing the \"Mellow vibes accent \"Venus as a Boy\"\", hoped that \"Björk won't waste her vocal talent on such talentless music\".\n\nThe song was nominated in the \"Song of the Year\" category at the inaugural Icelandic Music Awards in 1993.\n\nThe movie \"Léon\" features the song in a wordless series of scenes between the two main characters.\n\nThe song was covered by Nils Landgren (musician) - 5000 Miles (1999); Sneaker Pimps (2004); Corinne Bailey Rae (2007) and as an instrumental by Australian jazz pianist Barney McAll, on his album \"Mother of Dreams and Secrets\" (2005), as well as American jazz pianist Geoff Keezer on his albums \"Zero One\" (2000) and \"Wildcrafted: Live at the Dakota\" (2005). A version in Japanese was recorded by Zoey (2003) and released as a single with accompanying music video. It was also covered by The Mike Flowers Pops (1996). On Andy McKee's album \"Gates of Gnomeria\" (2007), there is an instrumental version of the song, titled \"Venus as a Girl\". The other artists who covered \"Venus as a Boy\" on their releases include Ásgerður Júníusdóttir, Serena Fortebraccio, Wildlife, E-Clypse, The Da Capo Players, Björkestra, Don Swanson, The Kate Peters Septet, The Violet Jive, Howl, Iris Ornig, Joo Kraus, Lars Duppler, Las Damas Y La Orquesta Invisible, Coparck, Workshy, Squid Inc., Realistic Orchestra, Sole Giménez, Sharon Sable, 2nd Backyard Junk and Camila Meza.\n\nThe music video was directed by Sophie Muller and features Björk in a kitchen, fondling and cooking eggs. The usage of eggs was inspired by the singer's favorite book, \"Story of the Eye\" by Georges Bataille, a novella which deals with the bizarre sexual perversions of a pair of teenagers. At one point in the book, a girl, Simone, uses boiled eggs for sexual stimulation.\n\nThe story of the egg comes as Björk explains: \nShe gave Muller a copy of \"Story of the Eye\" a couple of days before they filmed but didn't insist that she read it. Muller didn't have the time. After recording the video and then reading the book, Muller admitted to Björk that \"Fried was the wrong egg!\"\n\nMuch of the cutlery featured in the music video came from Björk's house.\n\nThe video opens with Björk, in an orange tee, in a kitchen, seemingly thoughtful. She leans on a table and while she's admiring an egg, she starts to sing. She turns on the fire and starts to fry some butter. As the second verse begins, the butter starts to burn so she takes it under the stream of the sink. She pours some oil in a pan and appears thoughtful again, after which she adds the eggs to the pan.\n\nVarious frames of the frying eggs and Björk playing with a spatula are shown; at one point the eggs appears burned, causing Björk's concern, but then they return unspoiled. During the gibberish part of the song, Björk grabs and gently caresses a bearded dragon. While she passes a hand on her forehead to wipe her sweat, she seems to perspire sparkles from her forehead, and then starts to emanate them from all over her body. The video ends as Björk takes her dish and goes away from the kitchen.\n\nThe video was praised for its sensuality. Joe Clark, comparing the video with that of \"Big Time Sensuality\", stated that the video offers \"bigger-time sensuality (\"His wicked sense of humour suggests exciting sex\"), though it’s symbolized by the eggs and butter Björk uses to fix herself breakfast\".\n\nThe \"egg portion\" of the video was parodied by comedic duo French and Saunders in a collaborative effort, featuring a spoof of the \"It's Oh So Quiet\" and \"Big Time Sensuality\" videos as well.\n\nOn August 13, 1993, Björk performed the song on the UK show \"The Beat\", in one of her first TV appearances. She performed the song on \"Top of the Pops\", on \"120 Minutes\" along with \"Come To Me\" and on \"3 From 1\" with \"Violently Happy\".\n\nBjörk appeared on the fifth season of the British television show \"Later... with Jools Holland\", singing \"Hyperballad\", \"Possibly Maybe\" and a version of the song accompanied by Guy Sigsworth on the Harpsichord. The performance was released on Björk's DVD \"Later with Jools Holland\"; this version was also included on \"Live Box\". The song was part of her MTV Unplugged setlist.\n\nThe singer performed the song during all of her tours (excluding her Greatest Hits Tour). During the Debut Tour, she performed the song with Indian instruments. During the Post Tour, the song's performance was enhanced with an Accordion. Most recently, during her Volta Tour and Biophilia Tour, she performed the song with harpsichord accompaniment by Jónas Sen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1836545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836545", "title": "Big Time Sensuality", "text": "Big Time Sensuality\n\n\"Big Time Sensuality\" is a song by Icelandic singer Björk, released as the fourth single from her 1993 album \"Debut\". Written by Björk and staple collaborator Nellee Hooper and produced by Hooper, \"Big Time Sensuality\" is a house-influenced song that helped boost Björk's popularity worldwide, particularly the U.S., where she charted for the first time.\n\nThe lyrics deal with her relation with her friends and Hooper. The song features house grooves and electronic bass-sounds. The single release was actually the \"Fluke Minimix\", which is a mix by Fluke, and the song was performed in this version on various occasions, including the inaugural MTV Europe Music Awards. Critics praised the song and the remix calling them \"saucy\" and commenting on their house and pop flavors.\n\nA different edit of the Fluke remix was featured in the music video for the song, directed by Stéphane Sednaoui, in which Björk dances and sings on a truck throughout New York City. The video was praised by critics and fans and received heavy rotation on MTV channels.\n\nThe video edit of the Fluke remix was also featured in Björk's \"Greatest Hits\".\n\nAfter leaving The Sugarcubes, Björk traveled to London where she began having contacts with electronic music, and that inspired her to change her musical style from the pop-rock sounds of the Sugarcubes to a more alternative and electronic style of music. \"Big Time Sensuality\" was one of the last songs to be written for \"Debut\", and was originally planned to be the first single from the album, but it got delayed by the release of \"Human Behaviour\". It was then intended to be the third single, but it got delayed again by the success of \"Play Dead\", and was finally released as the fourth single in November 1993.\n\nThe song was co-written by Björk and Nellee Hooper and produced by Hooper, which helped her in writing and producing her first two albums. The singer's meeting with Hooper inspired her in writing the song: \"I think it's quite rare, when you're obsessed with your job, as I am, when you met someone who's your other part jobwise and enables you to do what you completely want\". The lyrics deals with enjoying life to its fullest and, in spite of its name, it was inspired by Björk's friends. The lyrics deal also with braveness: \"I’ve got a lot of courage, but I’ve also got a lot of fear. You should allow yourself to be scared. It’s one of the prime emotions. You might almost enjoy it, funny as it sounds, and find that you can get over it and deal with it. If you ignore these things, you miss so much. But when you want to enjoy something, especially when it’s something you’ve just been introduced to, you’ve got to have a lot of courage to do it. I don’t think I’m more courageous than most people. I’m an even mixture of all those prime emotions\".\n\nAfter the release of Debut, Björk's songs received numerous remixes from different producers. \"Big Time Sensuality\" received three different remixes from Fluke. One of them, called the \"Fluke Minimix\", was chosen by Björk to receive a single treatment instead of the original, and the remix was performed on different occasions and a music video was made of it. An extended version of the \"Fluke Minimix\" was used as the \"single version\" of the song, and is also the version used in the video. However, this version was not available until the release of Björk's \"Greatest Hits\", as the version featured on the single was shorter.\n\nThe single also contained \"Glóra\" \"(\"Gloria\")\" and \"Síðasta Ég\" \"(\"The Last Me\")\" as B-sides, two songs that were recorded by The Elgar Sisters, a group formed in the early eighties by guitarist Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and Björk. \"Glóra\" is an instrumental track which features a flute-solo played by Björk, who also wrote and produced the track. \"Síðasta Ég\" was written by Björk, Óttarsson and Þór Eldon Jónsson, a member of the Sugarcubes, and was produced by Björk and Óttarsson, with guitar played by Óttarsson.\n\nThe first two verses of \"Big Time Sensuality\" are underscored by upbeat keyboards that lead into electronica and techno-influenced grooves that Sandy Masuo of \"Option\" defined as \"brooding\". Björk belts out the first lines accompanied by a base of percussion, while the chorus features stronger electronic beats. After the first two verses, Björk sings some sounds like moans or shouts. Ben Thompson defined the yells sequence as \"sinuous pop-funk squawk\". After the interlude \"I don't know my future after this weekend/And I don't want to!\" funk-like sounds lead the song to an end.\n\nThe \"Fluke Minimix\" is composed on a series of synthesizers and by slower vocals. The remix features electronic bass and heavily uses reverb. The track ends with the lines \"It takes courage to enjoy it/The hardcore/And the gentle/Of Big Time Sensuality\" whispered by Björk.\n\n\"Big Time Sensuality\" was deemed as a highlight of \"Debut\" and was praised by critics. Sean McCarthy of the Daily Vault defined the track as \"insanely addictive\" while \"Vox\" journalist Lucy O'Brien called it \"saucy\". John Hamilton from \"Idolator\" wrote that \"this dancefloor monster resembles the soulful American house sounds of Crystal Waters and Ultra Nate in its original album mix, but for the single, it was revamped into a storming trance jam by remix duo Fluke.\" Simon Reynolds of \"The New York Times\" stated that \"the sultry \"Big Time Sensuality\" has her vaulting from chesty growls to hyperventilating harmonies so piercing she sounds as if she’s inhaled helium\".\n\nReviewing \"Debut\", Heather Phares of AllMusic, noted that \"Björk's playful energy ignites the dance-pop-like \"Big Time Sensuality\" and turns the genre on its head with \"There's More to Life Than This.\" Recorded live at the Milk Bar Toilets, it captures the dancefloor's sweaty, claustrophobic groove, but her impish voice gives it an almost alien feel\". The website cites the track as an All Media Network-pick, and in a track review, Stacia Proefrock defined the track as an \"aggressive, screechy dance number\" that \"While not scraping the top of the charts[...] was part of an album unusual enough to stand out among its fellow pop releases as a quirky and complex experiment that worked most of the time\".\n\n\"Big Time Sensuality\" was nominated in the Best Song category at the 1994 MTV Europe Music Awards, losing to \"7 Seconds\" by Youssou N'Dour and Neneh Cherry.\n\nTo shoot the music video for \"Big Time Sensuality\", Björk called upon Stéphane Sednaoui, who had previously directed videos for Madonna, U2, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Sednaoui heard about Björk when he went to Los Angeles for the first time and declared to be fascinated by her music. Björk personally wanted the director after seeing some photos of Kurt Cobain shot by him, that Björk recalled as being the only photos in which she saw Cobain \"laughing out loud and dancing\".\n\nSednaoui at first wanted to go to Iceland to shoot the music video, but the costs were too high for the budget. Björk explained the inspiration for the music video: \"when you're living on the edge and it's about the courage to enjoy life\". The director got the idea for the music video while he was in New York and realised that \"it would work amazingly with the city. With all the big buildings and everything and her voice\".\n\nThe video for \"Big Time Sensuality\" was shot in black and white on October 26, 1993 and features Björk dancing on the back of a moving truck slowly driving through New York City in the middle of the day. Björk appears in a white dress and with her typical hairstyle. The video uses film effects like slow motion and fast motion. The version of the song used in the video is a remix by Fluke. This version is an edit of the full \"Fluke Moulimix\" that was longer than the edit provided for radio (\"The Fluke Minimix\"). There is also a rare nighttime version which was released only on the director's label \"The Work of Stephane Sednaoui\" DVD as well as an uncut alternative daytime version.\n\nThe video helped Björk to be known in North America where it received heavy rotation on MTV channels, with many noting that the video was more known in the country than the song: \"Few people know how the melody for \"Big Time Sensuality\" starts, but anyone who watched MTV in the early '90s could cheerfully belt out the single measure when she sings the words \"Big Time Sensuality\".\n\nThe video was later spoofed by British comedians French & Saunders, in a low budget fashion (i.e., on a greenscreen), and also plays on the name of Iceland, Björk's home country, with the store of the same name. A short scene of the video can be seen in the movie \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001) in a vision sequence Tom Cruise has.\n\nThe song received a heavy promotion, and as such, Björk did numerous TV appearances. On 8 August 1993, she appeared on the UK show \"The Beat\", performing the song along with \"Venus as a Boy\" and \"Come to Me\". Björk performed the song live on other British show like \"Dance Energy\", \"Top of the Pops\" and \"Smash Hits Poll Winners Party\". She then performed the song live on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", in one of her first appearance on the American broadcast. She performed the track on \"MTV's Most Wanted\", where she performed also \"Human Behaviour\", and on \"The Grind\". On a rare lip-synch performance, she sang the song on the Italian show \"Festivalbar\". She also performed the song live, dressed in a big, red gown at the 1994 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she received two nominations. The song was part of her \"MTV Unplugged\" set list, where it received a different arrangement, accompanied by Indian Instruments and a harpsichord. Its performance was released on \"Debut Live\", which was included in \"Live Box\".\n\n\"Big Time Sensuality\" was a staple performance at her Debut Tour and Post Tour. Notably, its performance during the Post Tour at the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire in London was released on her VHS and DVD release \"Live at Shepherds Bush Empire\", with the same performance released on \"Post Live\", where it was given a \"much more minimal treatment\" accompanied by Leila Arab \"gently hyperkinetic jungle beats\".\n\nThe information regarding accolades attributed to \"Big Time Sensuality\" is adapted from Acclaimed Music, except where otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1836571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836571", "title": "Star Cops", "text": "Star Cops\n\nStar Cops is a British science fiction television series first broadcast on BBC2 in 1987. It was devised by Chris Boucher, a writer who had previously worked on the science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" and \"Blake's 7\" as well as crime dramas such as \"Juliet Bravo\" and \"Bergerac\". Set in the year 2027, a time where Interplanetary travel has become commonplace, it starred David Calder as Nathan Spring, commander of the International Space Police Force—nicknamed the \"Star Cops\"—who provide law enforcement for the newly developing colonies of the Solar System. The series follows Nathan Spring and the rest of his multinational team as they work to establish the Star Cops and solve whatever crimes come their way. Operating in a relatively accurately realised hard SF, near-future, space environment, many of the cases that the Star Cops investigate arise from opportunities for new crimes presented by the technologically advanced future society the series depicts and from the hostile frontier nature of the environment that the Star Cops live in.\n\nIn total nine episodes of \"Star Cops\" were made. A tenth episode, titled \"Death on the Moon\", was planned but industrial relations difficulties during production led to it being abandoned shortly before recording was to commence. A combination of factors, including conflict between Boucher and producer Evgeny Gridneff and poor scheduling, meant that the series never found a satisfactory audience and the series was cancelled after one season. In recent years, \"Star Cops\" has undergone something of a critical re-appraisal and is generally hailed for being \"a pretty good attempt at a moderately realistic \"\" SF series\".\n\nBig Finish announced in November 2017 that they would be releasing new Star Cops audio plays starring some of the surviving original cast members, beginning in 2018.\n\n\"Star Cops\" is set in the year 2027—some 40 years into the future at time of broadcast—a time in which space travel has become common and mankind is in the process of exploiting and colonising the Solar System. There are five permanently manned space stations orbiting the Earth and there are bases on the Moon and Mars. Approximately 3,000 people are living and working in space. This near future setting was influenced by the potential for greater access to space promised by the burgeoning Space Shuttle programme and by the militarisation of space through the US Government's Strategic Defense Initiative programme (also known as \"Star Wars\") both of which were underway in the early 1980s. Accordingly, space travel and life in space is portrayed in a realistic manner with depictions of weightlessness and low gravity environments and lengthy space journeys (months or years in cases of interplanetary travel) as well as hazards such as spacesuit failures, radiation exposure and explosive decompression. This air of realism has led to \"Star Cops\" being frequently compared with the 1973 BBC drama series \"Moonbase 3\". Similarly, the pioneering spirit evoked by the process of colonising the Solar System seen in the series has led to comparisons with the Western genre among many commentators.\n\nLaw and order is provided by the International Space Police Force (ISPF), twenty part-time volunteers disparagingly nicknamed the \"Star Cops\". The decision has been made to put the ISPF on a permanent full-time footing and a new commander, Nathan Spring, has been appointed to accomplish this. Many of the series episodes deal with Spring's efforts to establish the Star Cops—he sets up a base of operations on the Moonbase, recruits new staff, roots out and dismisses corrupt officers and works to extend the Star Cops' reach first into the American space stations and then, at the end of the series, the far-flung reaches of the Mars colonies, all the while investigating whatever crimes occur along the way.\n\nMany of the crimes that the Star Cops investigate have a science fiction \"twist\" to them arising from the unconventional (for a police show) environment the series is set e.g. a murder in which the two victims are not yet dead, a ransom demand for kidnapped embryos, a hoax discovery of an alien civilisation, etc. It is out of these scenarios that one of the major themes of the series emerges: the conflict between human emotion and morality on the one hand and machine logic and rogue science on the other.\n\nAnother major theme of the series is the \"sins of the father\": Spring's first assignment as a detective was to arrest his father for industrial espionage, the villain in \"Intelligent Listening for Beginners\" is motivated by his inability to match his father's reputation, Spring's deputy, David Theroux, watched his father die of radiation poisoning, the kidnapper in \"A Double Life\" is seeking revenge for his father's murder and Star Cop Anna Shoun betrays the multinational company which employs her (and with whom she has a paternal relationship) when she discovers their unethical behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Boucher began his television writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as \"Dave Allen at Large\" and \"Romany Jones\", before moving on to write for drama series, including \"Shoestring\", \"Juliet Bravo\" and \"Bergerac\". He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for \"Doctor Who\" and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of \"Blake's 7\" as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched \"Star Cops\" to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic \"Earthsearch\" serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first \"Star Cops\" story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how \"Star Cops\" was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series \"Bergerac\", was also told by Powell he could work on \"Star Cops\" or on \"Bergerac\" but not on both and so chose to leave \"Bergerac\".\n\nAssigned to produce \"Star Cops\" was Evgeny Gridneff, who had previously worked for the BBC on \"Tenko\", \"Blott on the Landscape\" and \"Hold the Back Page\". Gridneff and Boucher clashed over their respective visions for the series from the outset when, on their first meeting, Gridneff told Boucher that all his scripts would have to be rewritten. Boucher later remarked that their \"relationship started out at the bottom and worked its way down\".\n\nBoucher had intended to write all ten scripts for the series himself but the tight timescale under which the episodes had to be recorded meant he could only contribute five, with the rest written by John Collee (three scripts) and Philip Martin (two scripts). Having previously qualified and worked as a doctor, Collee was a journalist who wrote for \"The Observer\" newspaper and later moved into films, most notably writing the screenplay for \"\". Martin was an experienced scriptwriter, best known for the controversial BBC drama series \"Gangsters\", with previous experience in television science fiction, having written for \"Doctor Who\". Two directors were assigned to the show: Christopher Baker, who had worked with Gridneff before on \"Hold the Back Page\" as well as BBC veterinarian dramas \"All Creatures Great and Small\" and \"One by One\", and Graeme Harper who had directed two \"Doctor Who\" stories.\n\nAt the time, most British television drama was shot on a combination of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.\n\nCast as Nathan Spring was David Calder, an experienced character actor with a reputation for \"tough-guy\" roles and best known at the time for his role as Detective Inspector George Resnick in the Lynda La Plante television serial \"Widows\". Naming him Nathan after his youngest son, Boucher had originally written Spring as a much younger character, a high-flyer in his early thirties who had risen rapidly through the ranks of the police. Despite this Boucher was pleased with Calder's performance describing Calder as \"a class act\" whose \"performance was immaculate\". Trevor Cooper was cast as Colin Devis at the suggestion of Graeme Harper who had worked with him on \"Doctor Who\" and in theatre. The rest of the cast, with the exception of Jonathan Adams (who had a semi-regular role on \"Bergerac\"), were relatively unknown.\n\nGiven that the series was set in the relatively near future, Gridneff took great pains to ensure that the space scenes were depicted as accurately as possible, seeking advice from NASA and other space agencies as well as arranging a set visit by astronaut Pete Conrad, the third man to set foot on the Moon. Conrad's input proved useful in making the scenes set in weightlessness as convincing as the budget would allow. Assistance was also received from an aerospace manufacturer, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, who provided stock footage of astronauts training in a water tank and received an on-screen credit on the first episode \"An Instinct for Murder\".\n\nRecording of the series began on 12 August 1986 with the first block of episodes—\"An Instinct for Murder\", \"Conversations with the Dead\" and \"Intelligent Listening for Beginners\"—directed by Christopher Baker. This was followed by a block directed by Graeme Harper comprising \"Trivial Games and Paranoid Pursuits\", \"This Case to be Opened in a Million Years\" and \"In Warm Blood\". Christopher Baker then returned to the director's chair for \"A Double Life\" and \"Other People's Secrets\". Both directors had differing visions for the overall look and feel of the series, with the initial block directed by Baker favouring a pristine, brightly lit approach. This contrasted with the look preferred by Graeme Harper who drastically reduced the light levels (leaving many scenes illuminated only by computer monitor screens) and whose designer, Malcolm Thornton, dressed the sets in a messier and dingier fashion. When Baker returned for his second block of episodes, he sought to return to the brighter, cleaner look which led to some continuity problems. Meanwhile, Evgeny Gridneff and Chris Boucher's professional relationship continued to be stormy with Gridneff deciding to introduce a new Star Cop, Anna Shoun, without consulting Boucher. The cast and crew were well aware of the behind the scenes conflicts and David Calder later recalled that there was \"uncertainty as to which direction this series should go in\". Chris Boucher has been frequently critical of the way in which the series was realised and has since stated that, in retrospect, he wishes he had volunteered to produce the series himself. In response to Boucher's criticisms, Gridneff has said, \"I respect him as a writer and he's professional and, you know, it's his series and if it didn't quite go the way he thought, you know, that's unfortunate when you're dealing, you know, you're losing your baby\".\n\nThe final block was to be directed by Graeme Harper and would comprise the final two episodes \"Death on the Moon\", written by Philip Martin, and \"Information Received\", written by Chris Boucher. However industrial action at the BBC affected \"Star Cops\" and many other BBC programmes leaving a backlog of programmes once the strike had ended. Forced to prioritise and despite the fact that the episode had been cast, costumes made and sets constructed, the decision was taken to drop \"Death on the Moon\" and bring \"Information Received\", now titled \"Little Green Men and Other Martians\", forward. The three-day recording block for this episode began on 16 February 1987 just two days after recording of episode 8 had finished. Recording was further complicated when Erick Ray Evans fell ill and his lines had to split amongst the rest of the cast at the last minute with most of Theroux's dialogue going to Pal Kenzy. Production on \"Star Cops\" finally wrapped on 18 February 1987.\n\nThe theme song for the series, titled \"It Won't be Easy\", was written and performed by Justin Hayward, the lead vocalist with the Moody Blues. The theme was produced by record producer Tony Visconti who also composed, with Hayward, the incidental music for every episode. Gridneff hoped that the theme would act as a gentle method of enticing casual viewers into the series. Reaction to the music and Hayward's song in particular, has generally been negative. \"SFX\" magazine, in particular, has been highly critical of the theme tune: in one issue it was placed twenty-ninth in a list article titled \"The 50 Worst Things About SF Ever!\" while in another it was placed sixth in a list article titled \"The 10 Worst Things About UK Telefantasy\". Writer and critic Kim Newman has described the theme as the \"worst single theme tune of any TV show ever\". Chris Boucher has said that he \"hated the music. The incidental music wasn't appropriate and it didn't have the style and feeling it should have had\".\n\n\"Star Cops\" was broadcast on Monday nights at around 8:30pm starting on 6 July 1987 on BBC2. Competition was provided on BBC One by sitcom \"Terry and June\" and \"The Nine O'Clock News\". The fifth episode, \"This Case to be Opened in a Million Years\", was broadcast at the later time of 9.55pm. The BBC listings magazine \"Radio Times\" promoted the series, giving it the front cover of the 4–10 July 1987 edition accompanied by a four-page article by Johnny Black inside. \"Star Cops\" performed poorly in the ratings with an average audience across the series of only 2.2 million viewers. Chris Boucher has blamed the poor ratings on the timeslot the show was given, stating: \"There is nothing that has ever gone out on BBC 2 at half-past eight until twenty-past nine; it's a grotesque period. It doesn't synch with anything on BBC 1; it just doesn't work in relation to anything. You had to badly want to see \"Star Cops\" in order to watch it because you had to sacrifice at least two hours of viewing to see it. I can see why people didn't want to have that problem.\". He has also commented that the poor timeslot and the decision to air the series in July and August (a time when viewing figures are traditionally lower due to the summer) reflected the fact that \"Star Cops\" didn't have the confidence of the BBC management. This view is echoed by star David Calder who has described the timeslot as \"an act of sabotage and absurdity\".\n\nCritical reaction to the show was generally negative: writing in \"The Times\" following the broadcast of \"Conversations with the Dead\", Andrew Hislop wrote that \"\"Star Cops\" has neither the campiness of \"Star Trek\" nor the imagination of \"Dr. Who\" to overcome its technological limitations\". Also in \"The Times\", reviewing \"Intelligent Listening for Beginners\", Martin Cropper found that \"some of the individual plot-lines show invention of a sort, but the script is uniformly feeble\". Meanwhile, in \"The Sunday Times\", Patrick Stoddart was confused by the plot of \"This Case to be Opened in a Million Years\" asking readers \"if you are following any of this, please write to me and explain\". Letter writers to the \"Radio Times\" were split on the merits of the show: some such as P. Tricker of Alpheton, Suffolk praising it for having \"brilliant special effects, well-written scripts and actors who were convincing\" while others like Martin Bower of Allendale, Northumberland slated the \"dated designs, poor music [and] cheap sets\" and P. Curwen of Balloch, Dunbartonshire described it as \"boring – too much talk and not enough action\". Science fiction fandom at the time was more positive with Anthony McKay in \"Time Screen\" describing the series as \"one of the most refreshing telefantasy series for years\" while the British Science Fiction Association gave the show their Media Award in 1987.\n\"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" stated \"the low-key realism of the show was efficient enough\" but argued, in\nthe end, that \"Star Cops\" \"failed to imagine the future with any real vividness or depth\". \nThe low ratings doomed the show to a single season and, although admired, it has never developed a significant following among science fiction aficionados. Boucher has stated that, in retrospect, he feels that the series was too outlandish for crime drama fans and not outlandish enough for science fiction fans and that ultimately it appealed to neither.\n\nWhen recording was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher if he had any ideas for a further season of \"Star Cops\". Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond these few basic notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following \"Star Cops\", Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama \"The Bill\" before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series \"The House of Eliott\".\n\nThe demise of \"Star Cops\" after just nine episodes has been seen as indicative of the decline of British television science fiction in the 1980s and, after \"Doctor Who\" followed \"Star Cops\" into cancellation in 1989, there would be no British regular science fiction drama series on British television until \"Bugs\" began in 1995. However, \"Star Cops\" has undergone something of a reappraisal – in science fiction circles at least – since it went off the air in 1987. Reviewing the VHS releases for \"TV Zone\" in 1991, Gary Russell stated that \"\"Star Cops\" represents \"excellent\" science fiction\" and recanted his original impression of the series upon broadcast that it was \"\"Bergerac\" in spacesuits, complete with rather cruddy visual effects and boring performances\". A retrospective article penned by Keith Topping for \"Dreamwatch\" to mark the series' 10th anniversary in 1997 described \"Star Cops\" as \"a series that could (and should) have been one of the BBC's most popular, influential and entertaining products of the era. On at least one of these points the series failed miserably, but, certainly when it came to entertainment, it succeeded magnificently\". In 1999, when science fiction magazine \"SFX\" asked an expert panel from the SF field, including Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter, to compile a list of the top 50 SF shows of all time, \"Star Cops\" came thirteenth on the list, with \"SFX\" describing it as \"the SF TV show SF writers love. It wasn't perfect but it's as close as TV will ever get to producing proper written SF\". Later, in 2005, \"SFX\" went on to poll its readers for their list of the top 50 British telefantasy shows and \"Star Cops\" was voted into twenty-seventh position on the list. The BBC themselves revisited \"Star Cops\" in a thirty-minute retrospective documentary about the show, recorded as part of a series titled \"The Cult of...\", first broadcast on BBC Four on 28 November 2006 as part of that channel's \"Science Fiction Britannia\" season. Reflecting on the show in the programme, the author and critic Kim Newman said that \"the strength of \"Star Cops\" is the writing. I don't think any of the episodes are realised as well on screen as they are on the page. [...] If it had come back for another couple of seasons it might well have been the BBC's best science fiction show\". The documentary concluded that \"Star Cops\" was an \"overlooked gem\".\n\n\"Star Cops\" comprised nine episodes and was first broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 between 6 July 1987 and 31 August 1987. A tenth episode \"Death on the Moon\" was planned but abandoned following industrial action at the BBC.\n\nOn 9 November 2017, Big Finish Productions announced they would be releasing a new series of Star Cops stories as audio plays, with surviving original cast members David Calder, Trevor Cooper and Linda Newton reprising their roles as Nathan Spring, Colin Devis and Pal Kenzy respectively. Joining them will be Rakhee Thakrar as Priya Basu and Philip Olivier as Paul Bailey.\n\nTwo box sets of four adventures were announced, and released in May and December 2018 under the banner title of \"Mother Earth\".\n\nA further series, entitled \"Star Cops: Mars\" was announced on 1 November 2019, starring the core cast of Calder, Cooper and Newton. Two volumes, each containing three episodes are scheduled for release in December 2019 and June 2020.\n\nAdditionally, an audiobook novel \"The Stuff of Life\", written by Mike Tucker and narrated by Trevor Cooper, will be released in December 2019. It will be set between the events of \"Mother Earth\" and \"Mars\".\n\n<section begin=series /><section end=series />\n\n<section begin=series /><section end=series />\n\n<section begin=series /><section end=series />\n\nA very small amount of merchandising has been produced for \"Star Cops\". To coincide with the broadcast of the series in 1987, BBC Enterprises released Justin Hayward's theme song \"It Won't Be Easy\" as a 7-inch and 12-inch single. The 7-inch included the track \"Outer Space\" by Hayward and Tony Visconti, which was one of the incidental music tracks written for \"An Instinct for Murder\", on the B-side. The 12-inch had an extended version of \"It Won't Be Easy\" on the A-Side and the 7-inch version of \"It Won't Be Easy\" and \"Outer Space\" on the B-Side. \"It Won't Be Easy\" was later released on compact disc as part of the compilation \"The Best of BBC TV's Themes\".\n\nThe entire series was released by BBC Video in three volumes, each containing three episodes, on VHS video tape in 1991. Some purchasers of the VHS tapes also received embroidered ISPF and Moonbase patches made by Stewart Aviation, which were also available separately.\n\nChris Boucher novelised his five \"Star Cops\" scripts and they were semi-professionally published in two volumes by Judith Proctor. The first volume \"An Instinct for Murder\" was adapted from the first \"Star Cops\" episode of the same name. The second volume \"Little Green Men and Other Stories\" included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko is replaced by a Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, as an attempt to update the \"Star Cops\" universe to reflect the ending of the Cold War in 1989. Shoun is replaced by an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee. The two volumes were combined into a single book or eBook, published by What Noise Productions in May 2013, and available through Amazon and Bandcamp.\n\nThe complete series was released on DVD by Network Video in a single, three-disc volume in 2004. This release contained a number of extras including commentaries by Chris Boucher on \"An Instinct for Murder\" and \"Little Green Men and Other Martians\" and by Philip Martin on \"This Case to be Opened in a Million Years\" as well as a making of documentary, interviews with Chris Boucher, Philip Martin and Trevor Cooper and behind the scenes footage.\n\nA book entitled \"Above the Law: The Unofficial Guide to Star Cops\", written by Paul Watts, is due to be published in early 2020 by Miwk Publishing. It will chronicle the series from concept to screen, as well as audio, and will feature features over thirty interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n"}
{"id": "1836579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836579", "title": "Up the Down Steroid", "text": "Up the Down Steroid\n\n\"Up the Down Steroid\" is the second episode in the eighth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2004. In the episode, Jimmy enters the special Olympics but starts using steroids to improve his performance. Cartman, believing he will have an advantage over the other children, disguises himself as handicapped so he can enter and win the cash prize. The title of the episode is a parody of the book \"Up the Down Staircase\".\n\nIn 2000, the actual Spanish Basketball team at the 2000 Summer Paralympics were disqualified and stripped of their gold medal after it was revealed almost none of the players were actually disabled.\n\nTimmy and Jimmy, two disabled children in South Park, are eager to participate in the Special Olympics in Denver. Cartman decides to fake being disabled and attempt to beat all the handicapped children in the events to win the $1,000 prize. Jimmy is talked into taking steroids by Nathan to increase his chances of winning. He manages to keep his use of it a secret from everyone except for Timmy (who discovers the drugs after he accidentally dropped the bag and spilling the contents). While Timmy frowns on this, being unable to say anything other than either his own and Jimmy's names, he is unable to explain the situation to the school counselor Mr. Mackey.\n\nJimmy begins to neglect his girlfriend and studies as a result of his steroid use. When his girlfriend grows tired of neglect and announces she is leaving him, Jimmy flies into a steroid rage and savagely attacks his girlfriend and mother. Kyle repeatedly tries to talk Cartman out of his plans but is ignored. At the Special Olympics, the prizes are given by Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds. Jimmy sets multiple records and is declared the winner. Cartman, on the other hand, is so out-of-shape that his plan fails miserably when the more athletic handicapped contestants beat him; he nevertheless wins a \"spirit award\" - consisting of a gift voucher - for coming last. When he goes to collect the prize, Jimmy recognizes Cartman and is about to attack him, but Timmy intervenes, and Jimmy realises that he is just as much of a cheater himself. Jimmy confesses his drug use to the crowd and returns his medal, asking for his records to be cancelled and that people who use steroids are \"pussies\" (all the while the camera focuses on McGwire, Giambi, and Bonds during his speech). The people give Jimmy a standing ovation for being honest, and he says he will be back next year. Cartman then claims to Stan and Kyle that he pretended to be handicapped in order for Jimmy to learn his lesson, but Stan and Kyle don't buy his lies; in anger, Cartman calls them \"assholes\" and tells them to \"grow up\".\n\nThere was some controversy surrounding \"Up the Down Steroid\" and the 2005 film \"The Ringer\", as both feature the same plot: someone pretending to be disabled in order to compete in the Special Olympics. \"The Ringer\" was written and filmed months before this episode was aired, although, \"The Ringer\" was not released to the public until after this episode aired. According to the episode's DVD audio commentary, series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not think that they ripped off \"The Ringer\", since the idea to them did not seem hard to come up with, and they did not even think it was big enough for a twenty-minute episode let alone a two-hour film. \n\nIn the opening scene, the boys are playing the same \"Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis\" funtime game as they did in the season four episode \"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\".\n\nThe episode's title refers to the 1964 young adult novel \"Up the Down Staircase\", by Bel Kaufman, which was adapted into a film in 1967 starring Sandy Dennis. Trey Parker admitted he had to perform this story in a high school play and hated it. Additionally, Stone admitted in the commentary that he once pretended to be disabled to get into Six Flags Magic Mountain for half price.\n\n\"Up the Down Steroid\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n"}

S. Adhiyaman. It features Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit in the lead roles, with Aishwarya Rai in a cameo appearance.\n\nThe movie is K. S. Adhiyaman's first in Hindi, a remake of his own Tamil film, \"Thotta Chinungi\". It took five years to make, with huge sabbaticals between shoots due to production problems. The rights of the film was owned by Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment.\n\n\"Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam\" is the third film to feature the two-Khans together after the blockbusters \"Karan Arjun\" (1995) and \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998). Dixit was cast opposite both Khans for the fourth time–she worked with Salman Khan in the flop \"Dil Tera Aashiq\" (1993) and the blockbusters \"Saajan\" (1991) and \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" (1994); and with Shah Rukh Khan in \"Anjaam\" (1994), \"Koyla\" (1997), and \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" (1997).\n\nDev Narayan (Alok Nath) lives with his widowed daughter Laxmi (Aruna Irani) and her children Radha and Prashant. Dev also looks after two orphaned children, Gopal and Nita. Laxmi believes that Dev is taking more care of Gopal and Nita, so she leaves the house with her children. When she spots an orphaned boy on the streets, she takes him in. Radha forms a sisterly bond with him and names him Suraj.\n\nYears later, Suraj (Salman Khan) is now a famous and popular singer. Radha (Madhuri Dixit) is particularly fond of him – Suraj is grateful to her for contributing to his success. Meanwhile, Gopal (Shah Rukh Khan) has become a wealthy business tycoon. When Laxmi is killed in an accident, Radha and Prashant (Atul Agnihotri) are taken to live in Gopal’s house. Also living with them is Nita (Suman Ranganathan). Gopal asks Radha to marry him and she agrees. Before their wedding, Suraj asks Gopal to watch over Radha, as he loves her like a sister. On their wedding night, Gopal asks Radha who she loves most in the world. She answers her mother and Prashant. Gopal is hurt that she did not mention him. As time goes on, he starts to disapprove of two things. First, he does not like the fact that he and Radha are supporting Prashant financially and second, he does not like the fact that Radha is always on the phone with Suraj. After a misunderstanding, he loses his temper and throws Prashant out of the house.\n\nGopal soon suspects that Suraj and Radha are secretly seeing one another and throws her out of his house too. Radha goes to live with her relatives. Everybody thinks that Radha has simply moved out for a few days. However, when Gopal sends Radha a divorce note, Suraj realizes the situation. He and Prashant tell Radha they wish to speak to Gopal, but Radha does not want them to do so. Suraj secretly holds a meeting with him anyway. Gopal angrily confronts him, pulls out a loaded gun, and asks Suraj to shoot him. After an argument, he leaves. Suraj now believes that he is the reason for Radha’s divorce and feels guilty. He is determined to set things right. Radha realizes that Gopal was angry about her relationship with Suraj. She and Suraj agree never to meet again.\n\nSuraj explains the situation to his girlfriend Suman (Aishwarya Rai). Suman talks to Gopal and explains where he went wrong. Gopal realizes that he misunderstood Radha and Suraj’s sibling relationship for adultery. Just as Radha is about to commit suicide, Gopal stops her and they reconcile. They visit Suraj at his show. Gopal and Suraj apologize to one another and things end well.\n\n\nProduction was first reported in February 1996 when it was revealed that producer K. C. Bokadia had signed on K. S. Adhiyaman to remake his successful Tamil film \"Thotta Chinungi\" (1995) into Hindi. Initially it was revealed that Sunny Deol, Juhi Chawla and Aamir Khan were to play the three lead roles, though there ended up being a total change of cast, with Salman Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Shahrukh Khan replacing them.\n\nThe music was composed by Nadeem-Shravan, Nikhil-Vinay, Daboo Malik, Bappi Lahiri, Bali Brahmabhatt, and Sajid-Wajid. Lyrics were penned by Sameer, Praveen Bhardwaj, Maya Govind, Kartik Avasthi, and Jalees Sherwani. The background score was composed by Uttam Singh. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 16,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fifth highest-selling.\n\n\"Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam has sparkling star cast\" said Taran Adarsh the Indian Film critic journalist.\n\nReviewer Anita Bora writes \"A medium-sized dose of love with a big dash of suspicion. Add to it several scoops of friendship. Towards the end, add a few drops of humor\". She even says that \"The premise of the film is simple. Jealousy. If you discount the fact the 'falling in love' was instant (but when is it not?), the topic is quite interesting. Haven't we all at some point read too much into situations, overreacted, undergone pangs of jealousy that seem downright silly later?\"\n\n\"Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam\" grossed in India and $2.55 million (12.49 crore) in other countries, for a worldwide total of , against its budget.

It is encountered in nucleophilic substitution.\n\nIn reaction conditions that favor a S1 reaction mechanism, the intermediate is a carbocation for which several resonance structures are possible. This explains the product distribution (or product spread) after recombination with nucleophile Y. This type of process is called an S1' substitution. \n\nAlternatively, it is possible for nucleophile to attack directly at the allylic position, displacing the leaving group in a single step, in a process referred to as S2' substitution. This is likely in cases when the allyl compound is unhindered, and a strong nucleophile is used. The products will be similar to those seen with S1' substitution. Thus reaction of 1-chloro-2-butene with sodium hydroxide gives a mixture of 2-buten-1-ol and 3-buten-2-ol: \n\nNevertheless, the product in which the OH group is on the primary atom is minor. In the substitution of 1-chloro-3-methyl-2-butene, the secondary 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol is produced in a yield of 85%, while that for the primary 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol is 15%.\n\nIn one reaction mechanism the nucleophile attacks not directly at the electrophilic site but in a conjugate addition over the double bond:\n\nThis is usual in allylic compounds which have a bulky leaving group in S2 conditions or bulky non-leaving substituent which give rise to significant steric hindrance, thereby increasing the conjugate substitution. This kind of reaction is termed S1' or S2', depending on whether the reaction follows S1-like mechanism or S2-like mechanism. Similar to how there are S1' and S2' analogues for S1 and S2 reactions respectively, there also is an analogue for Si, that being the Si', applicable for reactions betwixt allylic compounds and reagents like SOCl.\n\nThe synthetic utility can be extended to substitutions over butadiene bonds:\n\nIn the first step of this macrocyclization the thiol group in one end of \"1,5-pentanedithiol\" reacts with the butadiene tail in 1 to the enone 2 in an allylic shift with a sulfone leaving group which reacts further with the other end in a conjugate addition reaction.\n\nIn one study the allylic shift was applied twice in a ring system:\n\nIn this reaction sequence a Jacobsen epoxidation adds an epoxy group to a diene which serves as the leaving group in reaction with the pyrazole nucleophile. The second nucleophile is methylmagnesium bromide expulsing the pyrazole group.\n\nAn S2' reaction should explain the outcome of the reaction of an aziridine carrying a methylene bromide group with methyllithium:\nIn this reaction one equivalent of acetylene is lost. \n\nExamples of allylic shifts:\n\nIn one adaptation called a SN2' reduction a formal organic reduction on an allyl group containing a good leaving group is accompanied by a rearrangement. One example of such reaction is found as part of a Taxol total synthesis (ring C):\n\nThe hydride is lithium aluminium hydride and the leaving group a phosphonium salt. The product contains a new exocyclic double bond. Only when the cyclohexane ring is properly substituted will the proton add in a trans position with respect to the adjacent methyl group. A conceptually related reaction is the Whiting reaction forming dienes.\n\nAllyl shifts can also take place with electrophiles. In the example below the carbonyl group in benzaldehyde is activated by diboronic acid prior to reaction with the allyl alcohol (see: Prins reaction):\n"}
{"id": "1836609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836609", "title": "Utilitarianism (book)", "text": "Utilitarianism (book)\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's book Utilitarianism is a classic exposition and defence of utilitarianism in ethics. The essay first appeared as a series of three articles published in \"Fraser's Magazine\" in 1861 (vol. 64, p. 391-406, 525-534, 659-673); the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863. Mill's aim in the book is to explain what utilitarianism is, to show why it is the best theory of ethics, and to defend it against a wide range of criticisms and misunderstandings. Though heavily criticized both in Mill's lifetime and in the years since, \"Utilitarianism\" did a great deal to popularize utilitarian ethics and has been considered \"the most influential philosophical articulation of a liberal humanistic morality that was produced in the nineteenth century.\"\n\nMill took many elements of his version of utilitarianism from Jeremy Bentham, the great nineteenth-century legal reformer, who along with William Paley were the two most influential English utilitarians prior to Mill. Like Bentham, Mill believed that happiness (or pleasure, which both Bentham and Mill equated with happiness) was the only thing humans do and should desire for its own sake. Since happiness is the only intrinsic good, and since more happiness is preferable to less, the goal of the ethical life is to maximize happiness. This is what Bentham and Mill call \"the principle of utility\" or \"the greatest-happiness principle.\" Both Bentham and Mill thus endorse \"classical\" or \"hedonistic\" forms of utilitarianism. More recent utilitarians often deny that happiness is the sole intrinsic good, arguing that a variety of values and consequences should be considered in ethical decision making.\n\nAlthough Mill agreed with Bentham about many of the foundational principles of ethics, he also had some major disagreements. In particular, Mill tried to develop a more refined form of utilitarianism that would harmonize better with ordinary morality and highlight the importance in the ethical life of intellectual pleasures, self-development, high ideals of character, and conventional moral rules.\n\nIn Chapter 1, titled \"General Remarks,\" Mill notes that there has been little progress in ethics. Since the beginning of philosophy, the same issues have been debated over and over again, and philosophers continue to disagree sharply over the basic starting points of ethics. Mill argues that these philosophical disputes have not seriously damaged popular morality, largely because conventional morality is substantially, though implicitly, utilitarian. He concludes the chapter by noting that he will not attempt to give a strict \"proof\" of the greatest-happiness principle. Like Bentham, Mill believed that ultimate ends and first principles cannot be demonstrated, since they lie at the foundation of everything else that we know and believe. Nevertheless, he claims, \"[c]onsiderations may be presented capable of determining the intellect,\" which amount to something close to a proof of the principle of utility.\n\nIn the second chapter, Mill formulates a single ethical principle, the principle of utility or greatest-happiness principle, from which he says all utilitarian ethical principles are derived: \"The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals \"utility\", or the \"greatest happiness principle\", holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.\"\n\nMill then spends the bulk of Chapter 2 responding to a number of common criticisms of utilitarianism. These include charges that utilitarianism:\n\n\nIn response to the charge that utilitarianism is a doctrine fit only for swine, Mill abandons Bentham's view that pleasures differ only in quantity, not quality. He notes that most people who have experienced both physical and intellectual pleasures tend to greatly prefer the latter. Few people, he claims, would choose to trade places with an animal, a fool, or an ignoramus for any amount of bodily pleasure they might thereby acquire. And since \"the sole evidence it is possible to produce that something is desirable, is that people do actually desire it,\" it follows that intellectual pleasures (e.g., the pleasures of friendship, art, reading, and conversation) are higher and more desirable kinds of pleasures than bodily pleasures, and that a rational pursuit of one's long-term happiness requires development of one's higher faculties.\n\nIn reply to the objection that there generally isn't enough time to calculate how a given act might affect the long-term general happiness, Mill sketches a kind of \"two-tier\" approach to ethics that accords an important place to moral rules in ethical decision-making. Mill argues that traditional moral rules such as \"Keep your promises\" and \"Tell the truth\" have been shown by long experience to promote the welfare of society. Normally we should follow such \"secondary principles\" without reflecting much on the consequences of our acts. As a rule, only when such second-tier principles conflict is it necessary (or wise) to appeal to the principle of utility directly.\n\nIn the third chapter, Mill asks what \"sanctions\" (that is, rewards and punishments) undergird the obligation to promote the general happiness. He explores a variety of ways in which both external and internal sanctions – that is, the incentives provided by others and the inner feelings of sympathy and conscience – encourage people to think about how their actions affect the happiness of others. The ultimate sanction, Mill claims, is internal. Humans are social animals who naturally desire \"to be in unity with our fellow creatures.\" To prefer selfish goals over the public good runs counter to this deep-seated natural impulse.\n\nIn the fourth chapter Mill offers his famous quasi-proof of the greatest-happiness principle. The core of his argument is this:\n\n\nMany critics have claimed that this argument relies on a dubious assumption about how individual happiness is related to the general happiness. There might be times when the general happiness can only be promoted by \"sacrificing\" the happiness of certain individuals. In such cases, is the general happiness a good to those individuals? Other critics have questioned whether it makes sense to speak of aggregates as having desires, or whether the fact that something is desired proves that it is desirable.\n\nThe fifth and longest chapter concludes by discussing what Mill considers \"the only real difficulty\" with utilitarian ethics: whether it might sometimes license acts of flagrant injustice. Critics of utilitarianism often claim that judging actions solely in terms of their effects on the general happiness is incompatible with a robust respect for individual rights and a duty to treat people as they deserve. Mill appreciates the force of this objection and argues\n\n\nMill's \"Utilitarianism\" remains \"the most famous defense of the utilitarian view ever written\" and is still widely assigned in university ethics courses around the world. Largely owing to Mill, utilitarianism rapidly became the dominant ethical theory in Anglo-American philosophy. Though some contemporary ethicists would not agree with all elements of Mill's moral philosophy, utilitarianism remains a live option in ethical theory today.\n\n\n\n"}

It simultaneously removes some kinds of dead code and propagates constants throughout a program. Moreover, it can find more constant values, and thus more opportunities for improvement, than separately applying dead code elimination and constant propagation in any order or any number of repetitions.\n\nThe algorithm operates by performing abstract interpretation of the code in SSA form. During abstract interpretation, it typically uses a flat lattice of constants for values and a global environment mapping SSA variables to values in this lattice. The crux of the algorithm comes in how it handles the interpretation of branch instructions. When encountered, the condition for a branch is evaluated \"as best possible\" given the precision of the abstract values bound to variables in the condition. It may be the case that the values are perfectly precise (neither top nor bottom) and hence, abstract execution can decide in which direction to branch. If the values are not constant, or a variable in the condition is undefined, then both branch directions must be taken to remain conservative.\n\nUpon completion of the abstract interpretation, instructions which were never reached are marked as dead code. SSA variables found to have constant values may then be inlined at (propagated to) their point of use.\n\n"}

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time she experiences delusions about meeting God, who ultimately appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Meanwhile, her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, and her brother struggles with sexual frustration.\n\nBergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of Fårö, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality.\n\n\"Through a Glass Darkly\" was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was followed by Bergman's thematically related 1963 films \"Winter Light\" and \"The Silence\".\n\nThe story takes place during a 24-hour period while four family members take their vacation on a remote island, shortly after one of them, Karin, is released from an asylum where she has been treated for schizophrenia. Karin's husband Martin (von Sydow), a respected doctor, tells her father David (Björnstrand) that Karin's disease is almost incurable. Meanwhile, Minus (Passgård), Karin's 17-year-old brother, tells Karin that he wishes he could have a real conversation with his father and feels deprived of his father's affection. David is a novelist suffering from \"writer's block\" who has just returned from a long trip abroad. He announces he will leave again in a month, though he promised he would stay. The others perform a play for him that Minus has written. David, while feigning approval of the play, takes offence since the play can be interpreted as an attack on his character.\n\nThat night, after rejecting Martin's erotic overtures, Karin wakes up and follows the sound of a foghorn to the attic. She faints after an episode in which she hears voices behind the peeling wallpaper. She then enters David's room and looks through his desk and finds his diary, seeing he described her disease as incurable. She discovers his callous desire to record the details of her deterioration. The following morning, David and Martin, while fishing, confront each other over Karin. Martin accuses David of sacrificing his daughter for his art and of being self-absorbed, callous, cowardly, and phony. David is evasive but admits that much of what Martin says is true. David says that he recently tried to kill himself by driving over a cliff but was saved by a faulty transmission. He says that after that, he discovered that he loves Karin, Minus and Martin, and this gives him hope. Meanwhile, Karin tells Minus about her episodes, and that she is waiting for God to appear behind the wallpaper in the attic. Minus is somewhat sexually frustrated, and Karin teases him, even more so after she discovers that he hides a pornographic magazine. Later, on the beach, when Karin sees that a storm is coming, she runs into a wrecked ship and huddles in fear. Minus goes to her and they engage in incestuous sexual activity.\n\nMinus tells the other men about the incident in the ship and Martin calls for an ambulance. Karin asks to speak with her father alone. She confesses her misconduct toward Martin and Minus, saying that a voice told her to act that way and also to search David's desk. She tells David she would like to remain at the hospital, because she cannot go back and forth between two realities but must choose one. While they are packing to go to the hospital, she runs to the attic where Martin and David observe her actions. She says that God is about to walk out of the closet door, and asks her husband to allow her to enjoy the moment. She becomes fixated on a crack in the wall out of which a spider emerges. The ambulance, a helicopter, flies by the window, making a lot of noise and shaking the door open. Karin moves toward the door eagerly but then she runs from it, terrified, and goes into a frenzy of panic. Karin vanishes and, reappearing in a frenzy, is sedated. When she stands, she tells them of God: an evil-faced spider who tried to penetrate her. She looked into God's eyes, and they were \"cold and calm,\" and when God failed to penetrate her he retreated onto the wall. \"I have seen God,\" she announces.\n\nKarin and Martin leave in the helicopter. Minus tells his father that he is afraid, because when Karin had grabbed him in the ship, he began leaving ordinary reality. He asks his father if he can survive that way. David tells him he can if he has \"something to hold on to\". He tells Minus of his own hope: love. David and his son discuss the concept of love as it relates to God, and they find solace in the idea that their own love may help sustain Karin. Minus is grateful and in awe that he finally had a real conversation with his father, uttering: \"Papa spoke to me\".\n\nThe genre of \"family drama\" is one analytic approach, with academic Frank Gado referring to Minus as the \"consciousness\" of this portrayal of family. The tense relationship between the family members is revealed in the meal scene, where David's children are dismayed by his intentions to leave soon after returning to the family, placing a damper on the joy of the occasion. Minus expresses his desire, \"I wish I could talk to Papa just once\". Minus' play also reveals conflicts. Gado wrote that the story within a story takes place in Saint Teresa's Chapel, with Saint Teresa having used the \"interior castle\" as a symbol of the soul. While appearing to be \"Gothic nonsense\", Gado argued that Minus was attempting to tell David that he has always fallen short of greatness as a writer, and that Minus' character uses art to explain his failings in love, in much the same way David retreats to writing to avoid being with Karin. Gado further argued that David's blindfolding before the performance signifies his eyes opening to reality.\n\nThe fact that David plans to use Karin's condition as a source for his writing creates a \"portrait of the artist as charlatan, windbag, and heartless exploiter\", essayist Peter Matthews wrote. In the end, when David shares his thoughts of love as God to Minus, Gado believed Minus is most impressed not by the theory but the \"face to face\" encounter with his father and the sharing of love, signified in Minus' closing line \"Papa spoke to me\".\n\nIn Karin's relationship with her husband, psychiatrist Barbara Young wrote Karin appears \"withdrawn\" sexually from Martin, but her sexuality is \"still alive in her psychosis\". Young observed what she described as a \"flirtatious\" relationship she has with Minus, and when she hears voices, she \"massages her thighs in a sexual way\". Her sexuality and knowledge of Minus' sexual frustration is what leads her to incest with Minus, and why they defy the incest taboo, Young wrote. She believed it was this episode of incest that finally led Karin to realize that she \"can't live in two worlds\".\nKarin envisions God as a \"spider-god\". Bergman's next film, \"Winter Light\" explains the metaphor when the character Tomas, played by Björnstrand, relates the spider-god to suffering, as opposed to his previous ideas of a God of love that provides comfort. The story ends with a discussion of how God is love, a question further explored in \"Winter Light\", which asks if understanding God is as simple as that. One \"Winter Light\" character mocks the idea of God as love, quoting the end of \"Through a Glass Darkly\" exactly. The title \"Through a Glass Darkly\" is derived from 1 Corinthians 13, which Gado observed also follows themes of \"faith, hope and love\".\n\nAfter Ingmar Bergman made notes on his ideas for the film in his diary, drawing on his personal experiences in planning to meet and reconcile with his parents Karin and Erik Bergman, Ingmar wrote the screenplay on the island of Torö in the Stockholm archipelago. He imagined it as a three-act play, where the acts serve as \"mirror panels,\" showing the same thing from different angles. This led to the phrase from the Biblical passage 1 Corinthians 13 being used as the film's title.\n\nBergman claimed the inspiration for the character of Karin was a woman he had lived with when he was younger. He reported she heard voices telling her to do things. The scene where David describes his attempted suicide is also inspired by Bergman's real-life attempt in Switzerland, before making \"Smiles of a Summer Night\" in 1955. Bergman explained that \"while I was preparing the film, I became interested in the human drama surrounding another human being who really was in the process of slipping away\". He also referred to his screenplay as \"a desperate attempt to present a simple philosophy: God is love, and love is God\". Bergman later regretted that message as lacking truth, and acknowledged that the optimistic epilogue was \"tacked loosely onto the end,\" causing him to feel \"ill at ease\" when later confronted with it. He added that \"I was touching on a divine concept that is real, but then smeared a diffuse veneer of love all over it.\"\n\nWhile working on \"Through a Glass Darkly\", he was adapting \"The Seagull\" by Anton Chekhov in the Royal Dramatic Theatre, and borrowed an idea from \"The Seagull\" in having Minus write a play. Bergman dedicated the film to his then-wife Käbi Laretei, with influence from what he described as their \"complicated, staged relationship\".\n\nIn keeping with his idea of the film being a \"chamber play\" in the mold of the work of August Strindberg, Bergman referred to his cast as a \"string quartet\". Bergman sent Andersson the screenplay, with Andersson initially declining, saying the role would be too challenging for her. She said Bergman replied with \"Don't give me that load of shit!\" To prepare, Andersson contacted a nurse to discuss schizophrenia. At the time, Lars Passgård was a novice actor.\n\n\"Through a Glass Darkly\" was filmed on the island of Fårö, at cinematographer Sven Nykvist's recommendation. It was Bergman's first film shot there, where he would film several more. Nykvist developed his style with the film, employing few camera movements. The director and cinematographer had very serious conversations in which they rethought how lighting should be employed. Nykvist and Bergman also planned to make \"Through a Glass Darkly\" as their first colour film collaboration, but were unhappy with the look of the colour shots they tested.\n\nThe film relies on natural sounds to convey silence in the characters' lives, with cello music after the incest scene being an exception. Four interpretations of Sarabande from Suite No. 2 in D minor for Cello, BWV 1008 by Johann Sebastian Bach are used in the film, with cellist Erling Blöndal Bengtsson providing all of them.\n\nIn Sweden, the film was released by SF Studios on 16 October 1961. The film also screened at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival during June and July 1962.\n\nJanus Films launched the film's U.S. release in New York City on 13 March 1962, delaying it until the finalists for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film were announced. Janus also promoted its Oscar campaign by screening it for Academy members in Los Angeles before voting occurred. On 19 August 2003, The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in Region 1, along with Begman's films \"Winter Light\" and \"The Silence\" and Vilgot Sjöman's documentary \"Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie\". On 20 November 2018, Criterion included a Blu-ray version, along with 38 other Bergman films, in the set \"Ingmar Bergman's Cinema\" in Region A.\n\nIn Sweden, the film received positive reviews for its characters, minimalist screenplay, and Harriet Andersson's performance. \"Variety\" staff described \"Through a Glass Darkly\" as \"Not a pleasant film, it is a great one\". \"Time\"'s review praised it as \"one of the best and certainly the ripest of Ingmar Bergman's creations\". In \"The New York Times\", Bosley Crowther called the film \"tightly constructed and starkly realistic,\" and Andersson \"beautifully expressive of the haunting awareness, the agony of madness, that move the girl\". U.S. critic Brendan Gill called Andersson \"well-nigh perfect\". U.K. critic Tom Milne wrote that despite a concept suggesting \"angst and self-torture,\" the film is \"warm and highly controlled,\" and Andersson is brilliant. \"The New Republic\" critic Stanley Kauffmann, calling it \"a Strindbergian study in mental torment,\" wrote its scenes were \"gripping\" and Andersson is \"stark, beleaguered, volatile\".\n\nMuch of the criticism focused on the ending, where the characters appear overly calm despite losing Karin, and God is simply equated with love. In 2008, Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list, impressed by Nykvist's lighting and concluding \"we're struck by Bergman's deep concern that humans see the world as through a glass, darkly, and are unable to perceive its meaning\". In his \"2014 Movie Guide\", Leonard Maltin gave the film three and a half stars, describing it as a \"Moody, evocative story of insanity\". The film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.72/10.\n\nThe film won the 1962 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, marking the second year in a row Bergman had won the award, after \"The Virgin Spring\" in 1961. Harriet Andersson attended the ceremony to accept the Academy Award on Bergman's behalf. The film was also in competition for the Golden Bear at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n\"Through a Glass Darkly\" is sometimes considered the first film in a trilogy that includes \"Winter Light\" and \"The Silence\", and focuses on spiritual issues. Bergman writes, \"These three films deal with reduction. \"Through a Glass Darkly\" – conquered certainty. \"Winter Light\" – penetrated certainty. \"The Silence\" – God's silence – the negative imprint. Therefore, they constitute a trilogy\". He later retracted his claim the films form a trilogy.\n\nBergman would return to Fårö to shoot several more films, including \"Persona\" (1966), \"Hour of the Wolf\" (1968), \"Shame\" (1968), \"The Passion of Anna\" (1969), \"Fårö Document\" (1969) and \"The Touch\" (1971). \"Fårö Document\" is a documentary, while the others use the island for symbolism and have been termed the \"island films\".\n\nIn 2004, producer Andrew Higgie persuaded Bergman to allow a stage version of the work, initially intended for a production by Andrew Upton and Cate Blanchett during their time as Co-Artistic Directors at Sydney Theatre Company. Upton relinquished the project to Jenny Worton, dramaturg of the Almeida Theatre, London, where it was presented in July 2010, starring Ruth Wilson in the lead role of Karin.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

It is set in Britain and the faery Otherworld around the beginning of the third millennium.\n\n\"The Age of Misrule\" consists of three novels: \"World's End\", \"Darkest Hour\", and \"Always Forever\".\n\nThis series is followed by \"The Dark Age\" series.\n\nThe story starts in January. The audience is not told what year it is: sometime after December 31, 1999, but not very long. It follows a man and a woman, both of whom have had loved ones taken from them in unpleasant circumstances. They see a man being killed by a giant. When they investigate, they discover that the man had been contacting UFOlogists.\n\nThe two protagonists decide to go on a trip to find out more. They meet an old hippie named Thomas, who saves them from a Fabulous Beast (a dragon). He informs them that they are being followed, and they hide out in Stonehenge, protected by the ley energy of the monument. Thomas then informs them that the world has changed, most forms of modern technology have ceased to function while magic now works according to its traditional lore, and that mythic creatures - Fabulous Beasts, elementals, and most importantly, the Fomorians and the Tuatha De Danann - are coming back to the world. The Fomorians have arrived first, however, and the Tuatha de Danann can only be summoned by a group called the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons. Apparently roped into this, they agree to help.\n\nBy the end of the first book of the three-book series, the initial idea - that the evil Fomorians would be dragged back to the Otherworld by the good fairies - has been shattered. It seems that Celtic cosmology is much closer to Lovecraftian ideals (Evil vs. Indifferent) than to Christian ones (Evil vs. Good), despite the fact, it is hinted, that the spirit beings are the basis of all religions anyway. The Tuatha are as keen as the Fomorians to stay, and the heroes are left knowing that the world will never be the same again.\n\nThe heroes then realise that they were chosen by the mysterious 'earth energy', and that they can use this energy to inspire others and fight the Fomorians themselves. They fight back and, in a final battle in London, apparently win. However, the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons are shattered, one dead, one lost in the Otherworld, and the last three to pass the story on.\n\nAn interesting twist on the classic 'otherworldly conspiracy' story is that, rather than fairy myths being ancient misinterpretations of UFO abductions, the UFO stories are presented as modern misinterpretations of fairy myths.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following locations in the Otherworld are visited.\n\n"}

It is an institution formed of two complexes; the Museum of Ancient Iran () and the Museum of Islamic Archaeology and Art of Iran, which were opened in 1937 and 1972, respectively.\n\nThe institution hosts historical monuments dating back through preserved ancient and medieval Iranian antiquities, including pottery vessels, metal objects, textile remains, and some rare books and coins. It also includes a number of research departments, categorized by different historical periods and archaeological topics.\n\nThe brick building of the Museum of Ancient Iran was designed by French architects André Godard and Maxime Siroux in the early 20th century, and was influenced by Sassanian vaults, particularly the Taq Kasra at Ctesiphon. Its construction, with an area of about , began in 1935 and was completed within two years by Abbas Ali Memar and Morad Tabrizi. It was then officially inaugurated in 1937.\nThe Museum of Islamic Era was later built with white travertine on the grassy grounds of the Museum of Ancient Iran. It has gone through quite a few hasty interior changes, and was still being remodeled when the 1979 Revolution swept the country.\n\nWhile the Museum of Ancient Iran always had a clear mandate to show archaeological relics, as well as some rare medieval textiles and rug pieces, the newer complex began to also feature the exquisite Amlash pottery from prehistoric Caspian Sea regions of Iran. This followed some modern works, and the repeated gutting and remodeling of the interior.\n\nThe Museum of Ancient Iran consists of two floors. Its halls contain artifacts and fossils from the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic, as well as the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, early and late Bronze Age, and Iron Ages I-III, through the Median, Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanian eras.\n\nThe newer complex consists of three floors. It contains various pieces of pottery, textiles, texts, artworks, astrolabes, and adobe calligraphy, from Iran's post-classical era.\nThe oldest artifacts kept at the museum are from Kashafrud, Darband, and Shiwatoo, which date back to the Lower Paleolithic period. Mousterian stone tools made by Neanderthals are also on display at the first hall of the Museum of Ancient Iran. The most important Upper Paleolithic tools are from Yafteh, dating back about 30,000 to 35,000 years. There are also 9,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Sarab mound in Kermanshah, among many other ancient artifacts.\n\nThe ground floor of the newer complex has been dedicated to contemporary exhibitions. Temporary exhibition galleries are featured two or three times annually, and usually run for about one to two months. One of the most successful exhibitions, entitled \"Evidence for Two Hundred Thousand Years of Human-Animal Bonds in Iran\", ran from August to October 2014. The exhibition was mainly about the relation and coexistence of past human societies and various animal species in Iran, since the late Lower Paleolithic to modern decades.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1836626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836626", "title": "King Claudius", "text": "King Claudius\n\nKing Claudius is a fictional character and the primary antagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Hamlet\". He is the brother to King Hamlet, second husband to Gertrude and uncle and later stepfather to Prince Hamlet. He obtained the throne of Denmark by murdering his brother with poison and then marrying the late king's widow. He is loosely based on the Jutish chieftain Feng who appears in \"Chronicon Lethrense\" and in Saxo Grammaticus' \"Gesta Danorum\". There had never been an actual Danish King of that name.\n\nClaudius is seen at the beginning of the play to be a capable monarch as he deals diplomatically with such issues as the military threat from Norway and Hamlet's depression. It is not until the appearance of King Hamlet's Ghost in the courtyard that the reader questions his motives. During the play's progression he takes a turn for the worse by first resorting to spying, and, when that fails, murder.\nIt is in Act III Scene 3, when Claudius forestalls Hamlet's revenge by confessing his sins to God in his own private chapel, that the audience can be sure of his guilt. He is shown to be discontent and unhappy with the events taking place. The young prince spies him brooding about his wrongdoings and trying to pray for forgiveness, but he knows all too well that prayer alone will not save him if he continues to benefit from his own sin. If he were to truly repent, he would have to confess his sin and give up all he achieved through it, which he chooses not to do. Despite his remorse, the king still seeks Hamlet's death in an effort to save both his throne and his life, as he believes the prince is now aware of his part in King Hamlet's death. Hamlet is ready to kill him, only to back down, feeling that to kill the king in such a way would contradict the revenge conditions given to him by his father, who commanded him specifically: \"Taint not thy mind.\"\n\nWhen Laertes seeks revenge for his father Polonius' death at Hamlet's hands, Claudius finally concocts a 'surefire' plan to deal with Hamlet once and for all. He arranges a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes, but plots with Laertes to poison his foil and give Hamlet a poisoned drink. The king's plan fails; Queen Gertrude drinks from the poisoned chalice instead of Hamlet and dies, and Hamlet, after being struck by the poisoned foil, captures the same sword and strikes Laertes, who then finally reveals Claudius' plot. As Norway's army, led by young Prince Fortinbras, surrounds the castle, Hamlet finally exacts his revenge and slays Claudius by stabbing him with the sword and then forcing him to drink the poison that he had intended for Hamlet.\n\nThe character Claudius is both the major antagonist of the piece and a complex individual. He is the villain of the piece, as he admits to himself: \"O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven\" (Act III, Scene 3, Line 40), yet his remarkable self-awareness and remorse complicates Claudius's villain status, much like Macbeth. Claudius's fratricide is the corruption permeating the play's world – that which is, in the words of Marcellus (a guard), \"something … rotten in the state of Denmark.\" Shakespeare reminds the audience of the crime several times by having characters mention the story of Cain and Abel, including Claudius himself, who admits being inflicted with \"the primal eldest curse.\" Claudius's cruelty is reflected in his schemes to kill Hamlet – sending him to England to be killed, as well as setting up a rigged fencing match. Claudius is also a heavy drinker, proposing numerous toasts and presiding over a rowdy court; he appropriately succumbs to his own poisoned wine.\n\nThe king is not without redeeming virtues, though. He is seen to be an able monarch (notwithstanding the unfavourable comparison to his murdered predecessor in Hamlet's first soliloquy) as well as a quick thinker and smooth talker, who in Act IV, Scene 5 converts Laertes from rebel to accomplice. In Act III, Scene 1 he fleetingly shows remorse for his crimes, and attempts to pray in Scene 3, even as he realises that he cannot sincerely repent (\"Words without thoughts never to heaven go\"), and eventually continues in his evil ways. Most commentators agree that the king's evil nature is evident, and that the other aspects of his nature exemplify Shakespeare's ability to portray his villains as fully human.\n\nThe king is named after the Roman emperor Claudius, who was considered the archetype of an evil ruler in Shakespeare's time. The historical Claudius's incestuous marriage to and alleged poisoning by Agrippina the Younger, who was later herself murdered by her son Nero, are mirrored in the play, as Hamlet himself appears to note in Act III, Scene 2: \"Soft! now to my mother. / O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever / The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom ...\"\n\nAlthough the character is referred to as \"Claudius, King of Denmark\" in one stage direction, the name \"Claudius\" is never spoken by any character in the play.\n\nEduard von Winterstein portrayed Claudius in the 1921 German silent film adaptation of \"Hamlet\".\n\nBasil Sydney portrayed Claudius in Laurence Olivier's film adaptation of \"Hamlet\".\n\nAlan Bates portrays Claudius as a drunken, buffoonish, craven schemer in Franco Zeffirelli's film adaptation of \"Hamlet\".\n\nIn Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film version of \"Hamlet\", Claudius is played by Derek Jacobi. Jacobi had not only been Branagh's mentor as an actor, but had previously played Hamlet himself with Patrick Stewart playing Claudius in a BBC production.\n\nIn Michael Almereyda's 2000 film version of \"Hamlet\", Claudius is played by Kyle MacLachlan.\n\nPatrick Stewart once again portrayed Claudius with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2008, in a production directed by Gregory Doran.\n\nClive Owen portrayed Claudius in Claire McCarthy's Ophelia (2018 film).\n\nClaudius also inspired the character Miraz in C. S. Lewis' novel \"Prince Caspian\", part of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series.\n\nRon Perlman portrays Clay Morrow in the television series \"Sons of Anarchy\", which relies heavily on the general plot structure of \"Hamlet\"; his character is based on Claudius. Ron Perlman has said, \"I'm sure they're going to stick to the structure of \"Hamlet\" all the way to the end\" of the series.\n\nIn Disney's \"The Lion King\", the villain, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons in 1994 and Chiwetel Ejiofor in 2019), is modelled after Claudius; both characters murder their brothers and dissemble to their nephews to ascend to the throne.\n"}

The effect of the revised equations proposed in autodynamics is to cause particle mass to \"decrease\" with particle velocity, being exchanged with kinetic energy (with mass being zero and kinetic energy being equal to the rest mass at \"c\"). This exchange between mass and energy is the proposed mechanism underlying most of the derived conclusions of autodynamics.\n\nAncillary predictions of autodynamics include:\n\nAutodynamics is wholly rejected by the mainstream scientific community. Since Carezani's original publication, no papers on autodynamics have appeared in the scientific literature, except for additional papers by Carezani published in alternative journals such as \"Physics Essays\". A 1999 article in the magazine \"Wired\" quotes H. Pierre Noyes, a professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, as stating, \"autodynamics was disproved. Special relativity is correct\". Noyes was a researcher in an experiment attempting to compare the predictions of SR and AD, and concluded that the values calculated by SR were significantly closer to what was observed. Carezani later argued that the experiment was not relevant for comparing the two theories by pointing out that AD applies specifically to decay cases, yet the electrons in the Noyes experiment received energy from the external medium (klystron EM field). According to Lee Smolin, there has been \"no serious attempt [by the autodynamics supporters] to make an argument or to discuss experimental data that refute their basic claims\".\n\n\n"}

He also was a remarkable kick-returner, averaging 29.1 yards on kickoff returns in his CFL career.\n\nBud Grant, legendary Blue Bombers' (and later head coach of the Minnesota Vikings), considered Leo Lewis the best player he had ever coached, whether in Canada or the United States. Lewis was voted one of the CFL's top 50 players (#29) in a poll conducted by Canadian sports network TSN.\n\nHis career rushing total of 8,861 yards stood as a Winnipeg Blue Bomber record for 41 years until it was passed by Charles Roberts in 2007. His career totals in return yardage, and yards per carry, still stand as Blue Bombers records.\n\nLewis was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\nHe was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in August 2005.\n\nAlso, in 2005, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the team the Blue Bombers named their 20 All-Time Blue Bombers Greats, of which Lewis was a member.\n\nHe was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 2005.\n\nLewis was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in February 2018 Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nHe had three children, two of whom played professional gridiron football (one for the Minnesota Vikings – Leo Lewis III – and the other Marc Lewis for the USFL Denver Gold and Oakland Invaders and the CFL's Ottawa Rough Riders and the Calgary Stampeders.\n\nLeo Lewis died on Friday August 30, 2013 at his home in Missouri.

{"id": "1836672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836672", "title": "Dialogue of the Saviour", "text": "Dialogue of the Saviour\n\nThe Dialogue of the Saviour is one of the New Testament apocrypha texts that was found within the Nag Hammadi library of predominantly Gnostic texts. The text appears only once in a single Coptic codex, and is heavily damaged. The surviving portions indicate that the general content is a dialogue with Jesus, in a similar manner to, and possibly based on, the Gospel of Thomas.\n\nThe text is somewhat peculiarly constructed, containing also a few large interruptions seemingly out of place within, and only superficially edited into, the dialogue. Starting with a series of questions ultimately concerning esoteric knowledge and its pursuit, the text abruptly turns to a description of the origin of the world, interrupted briefly by a return to dialogue. Having expounded the description of creation, it returns to the Gnostic question and answer session about how to achieve salvation via gnosis, but is abruptly interrupted by a \"natural history list\" of the Four Elements, the powers of heaven and earth, and so forth.\n\nAfter the history list, there is an \"apocalyptic\" vision, in which Didymus Judas Thomas, Mary, and Matthew, are shown hell from the safety of the edge of the earth, and an angel announces that the material world was an unintended evil creation (see Yaltabaoth). Finally, the text returns to the question-based dialogue.\n\nThe rather artificial manner in which other texts (the vision of hell, the natural history list, and the creation theory) appear to have been inserted into a question-based dialogue, and the abrupt change halfway through from referring to Jesus as \"Lord\" to referring to him as \"Saviour\", has led many to propose that it is based on four or five different original works. However, due to the damage that the text has suffered, study of it has so far proven too difficult to identify what these texts might be (although the dialog shares an affinity with the Gospel of Thomas). The final redaction is estimated to have taken place around 150 AD.\n\n"}

It is sometimes known as Sanborn's long-nosed bat or the Mexican long-nosed bat, though the latter name is better avoided since it is also used for the entire genus \"Leptonycteris\" and for one of the other species in it, the greater long-nosed bat (\"L. nivalis\").\n\nOriginally described as a subspecies of the greater long-nosed bat, it was later considered a subspecies of the southern long-nosed bat, before being confirmed as a distinct species. Enthusiasts for the bats often refer to them simply as leptos because they are the best known members of the genus \"Leptonycteris\". The scientific name is derived from the type locality, near Yerbabuena in Guerrero, Mexico.\n\nLesser long-nosed bats are relatively small bats, with a total length as adults of around , and weighing between , depending on the time of year. Males and females are similar in size, and virtually indistinguishable. As their common name implies, they have a long, narrow snout, and this terminates in a small triangular nose-leaf. While they do have three internal caudal vertebrae, they have no visible tail.\n\nThe tongue of lesser long-nosed bats has a number of adaptations for lapping nectar, including long ridges and rough, conical papillae, which may also help protect against periodontal disease by scraping the teeth clean. Their wings have a high wing loading, allowing for energy efficient long-distance flight in open habitats, at the expense of manoeuvrability.\n\nOnly three other species of North American bat have a nose-leaf, and two of these, the Mexican long-tongued bat, and the California leaf-nosed bat, have a distinct tail, and also, in the latter case, much larger ears than lesser long-nosed bats do. They are more easily confused with their close relatives, the greater long-nosed bats, but, in addition to being about 10% larger, the latter have shorter, greyish fur, and proportionately longer wings.\n\nAdult lesser long-nosed bats are yellow-brown or grey above, with rusty brown fur below. Their ears are small.\n\nLesser long-nosed bats inhabit semi-arid grassland, scrub, or forest habitats below about . They are able to tolerate unusually high temperatures of up to , due in part to a low metabolic rate. They do not enter torpor or hibernate, but die at ambient temperatures of below about .\n\nIn the north, they reach southern California, Arizona and New Mexico. However, they are only found as summer migrants in the United States and, more generally, north of the mid-Sonora, arriving in these regions between April and July, and migrating south again in September. Some individuals have been estimated to migrate as far as each year. Their migratory patterns have been shown to follow a path determined by seasonal availability of food plants, with cacti, \"Agave\", and plants of the C3 metabolic pathway being strong predictors of distribution. They are found year-round in the western and southern parts of Mexico, and along the east coast, and in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.\n\nThere are no recognised subspecies.\n\nLesser long-nosed bats feed mainly on nectar from night-blooming plants such as saguaro, Organ Pipe Cactus, as well as century plant and other agaves. They are important pollinators of night-blooming cactus. They may also eat some cactus fruits, and, during the winter, on pollen from a range of other plants as the opportunity arises.\n\nLesser long-nosed bats roost during the day in large colonies of up to several thousand individuals in caves or abandoned mines, dispersing at night to feed. The size and composition of such colonies varies throughout the year, as the bats migrate to summer feeding grounds. At some times of the year, many colonies become occupied only by nursing females and their young, with males occupying smaller temporary roosts.\n\nThe breeding season lasts from November to December for bats that migrate northward during the summer, but from May to June in those that give birth in the south. Despite the presence of two distinct mating seasons, individual bats mate only once a year. Gestation lasts about six months, and results in the birth of a single pup, during the time of local peak flower availability.\n\nNewborn young weigh and are fully weaned at four to eight weeks of age. They are able fly after a month, but do not begin to exit the maternity cave for a further two to three weeks. They are known to live for up to at least eight years in the wild.\n\n\n"}

Although some of them become official Indian reservations, they differ from most reservations in that they are placed where Native Americans could find employment in mainstream American economy. Many were originally formed without federal encouragement or sanction.\n\nIndian colonies are especially common in Nevada. As the Great Basin ecosystem is very fragile, native lifeways became untenable soon after white settlement due to livestock over-grazing, water diversions and the felling of Pinyon pine groves. At that time there were few official reservations in the area, and those were terribly run even by contemporary standards. Many Native Americans chose instead to seek jobs in white ranches, farms and cities. The areas in which they settled became known as Indian Camps or Colonies. In some cases they owned the land they settled on, in other cases they settled on public land. Starting in the early twentieth century, the federal government began establishing Indian trust territories for the colonies on public land. \n\nFollowing the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, many of the Indian colonies gained federal recognition as tribes. Many of the tribes formed this way are unusual in that they include members from different nations. For example, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony has members with Washoe, Paiute and Shoshone heritage.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of Indian Colonies in the United States:\n\n"}

It was discovered by the carbohydrate chemist Robert J. Ferrier.\n\nIn the first step, a delocalized allyloxocarbenium ion (2) is formed, typically with the aid of a Lewis acid like indium(III) chloride or boron trifluoride. This ion reacts in situ with an alcohol, yielding a mixture of the α (3) and β (4) anomers of the 2-glycoside, with the double bond shifted to position 3,4.\n\nBy replacing the alcohol with a silane, C-glycosides can be formed. With triethylsilane (R'=H), the reaction yields a 2,3-unsaturated deoxy sugar.\nAn analogous reaction with nitrogen as the heteroatom was described in 1984 for the synthesis of the antibiotic substance streptazolin.\n"}

They formed in the year 2000 and are located in Beijing. Their music is a mix of British rock, hard rock, glam rock and goth rock. After several member changes and a couple years of inactivity, Silver Ash currently consists of original members Ling (vocals) and Zhen (drums), guitarist Yue, and bassist Cain. They are known as the first Chinese visual rock band and have played a significant role in increasing the movement's popularity in China.\nThe original line-up of Silver Ash included Ling (vocals), Lucy (guitar), Nancy (guitar), Hong (bass), and Zhen (drums). The band was produced by the Gorgeous Devil Studio and Scream Records from 2000-2005. Guitarist Nancy left the group before they signed to Scream Records. They toured China in 2002, performing in ten cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. In 2005, they chose to leave Scream Records and were without a record label (and still are). Due to personal reasons, some of the Silver Ash members were forced to leave the band.\n\nGuitarist Lucy was replaced by Yue. After much deliberation, Hong had to leave the band and was replaced by new bassist Yu.\nFrom there, they added Bai Niao (\"White Bird\"), on keyboard. Previously, Bai Niao was the vocalist and keyboardist of another Chinese visual rock band called \"Frozen Blood\" (冻结的血液).\n\nSilver Ash has faced a lot of difficulties. The other band members had left Silver Ash temporarily to pursue their careers, leaving only Ling for a short period of time. They were also scheduled to tour the US in 2003-2004, but it was canceled due to the SARS scare. It was last heard that they were still without a record label as well, but were given various offers from Japanese record labels such as Avex Trax. They were previously signed to Toshiba-EMI but were released from the contract again due to government problems. They have not released an album since 2005, citing the slumping economy and reluctant record label companies.\n\nSilver Ash held a live on August 30, 2006 with Japanese band La'cryma Christi, particularly to be viewed by the production company Sweet Child. They have also performed with the Japanese bands Rice and Gram∞Maria.\n\nIn 2011, Silver Ash released a limited 1000-run press of a new single, \"Pretty But Evil\". The international digital release of the track on January 4, 2013, inaugurated the beginning of their comeback. They are currently working on a new release which is slated to drop sometime in March or April 2013, for which there will be both English and Japanese versions in addition to their native Chinese.

On 1 January 2010 the municipalities of Malix and Parpan merged into Churwalden.\n\nParpan is first mentioned in 1208 as \"Partipan\". Formerly in Romansh it was known as \"Parpaun\".\n\n\"Parpan\" is a common surname in Graubünden. Etymologically \"Parpan\" originates from the French \"partis-pain\", meaning \"bread-deliverer\".\n\nParpan has an area, , of . Of this area, 64.9% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 3.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (9.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).\n\nThe municipality is located in the Churwalden sub-district of the Plessur district in the Churwalden valley. The village lies in the valley between the cantonal capital Chur and the resort Lenzerheide. It offers access to the skiing area of Rothorn and mountain railways Danis Staetz AG. The finish of the Alpine skiing World Cup slope \"Silvano Beltrametti\" for the downhill race in Lenzerheide is in Parpan.\n\nAt the end of 2013 the ski resort was linked with Arosa by cable-car, creating the new ski resort of Arosa Lenzerheide. Since then transport passes work in both resorts.\n\nParpan municipality consists of the \"Haufendorf\" village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Parpan. The municipalities of Malix and Parpan merged on 1 January 2010 into the municipality of Churwalden.\n\nParpan has a population () of 245, of which 7.3% are foreign nationals.

His Armenian dance, folk, and revolutionary and romantic songs make him a favorite among Armenians worldwide.\n\nIn his early teens, he took lessons in many musical instruments including the guitar, the bouzouki and saz (stringed instruments), the dhol (drums) and the piano, later forming a band called Erebouni. His interest in music was initially influenced by his mother, a singer. Erebouni went from village to village playing everything from Charles Aznavour to Deep Purple and Elvis, at weddings and universities. Due to restrictions under the Soviet Union, Harout and most of his family left Soviet Armenia in 1975. After a year in Lebanon, he went to Los Angeles and took up residence in Hollywood.\nHe has one son, who was born in 1980.\n\nOnly two months after his arrival in L.A. Harout put together a studio band and recorded his first album, \"Our Eyir Astvats\" (Where Were You, God?), in reference to the Armenian Genocide at the Quad Teck studio.\n\nThat first album barely resembles the sound he has since become known for. Instead of the duduk or synths, there are clarinet, organ and a lot of bass. Only a few of the songs on the first are dance-oriented, differing from the material that later made him popular at weddings. This made him popular and branded him the nickname \"The Armenian Wedding Singer\".\n\nHarout has interpreted songs composed by artists such as Ruben Hakhverdyan, Robert Amirkhanyan and Arthur Meschian. But it's the centuries-old folk tunes about protecting the soil and fighting in the highlands—\"Antranik Pasha,\" \"Sassouni Orore,\" \"Msho Aghchig\"—that appeal to his fans' nationalistic pride. He's most fond of Rouben Hakhverdian, including the 1996 almost all-acoustic \"Yerke Nayev Aghotk Eh\" (Songs Are Also Prayers). Harout has also covered favorites like \"Nuné\".\n\nA year after the 1988 Armenian earthquake, which killed 25,000 people and left many more homeless, hundreds of thousands of fans looking for some kind of temporary diversion from the devastation, packed the Hrazdan stadium and Karen Demirchyan Complex to hear 28 concerts by Harout.\n\nIn 2008, Harout appeared as children's music singer Bread Harrity on the sketch comedy show \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\", performing a song about spaghetti and meatballs.\nPamboukjian has released over 20 albums. Some of his famous interpretations include \"Asmar Aghchig\" (Dark Skinned Girl), \"Zokanch\" (Mother-in-law), \"Msho Aghchig\" (Girl from Mush), \"Msho Dashter\" (Fields of Mush), \"Hye Kacher\" (Armenian Heroes), \"50 Daree\" (50 Years) and \"Hey Jan Ghapama\"\n\nStudio Albums:\nLive Albums:\nCompilation Albums:\nSingles And Ep:\n"}

Population: \n\nThere are three several translations from the Nenets language:\n\nThe first mention of the city's name appears at the end of the 16th century. The name \"Nadym\" appears on Russian maps from the end of the 17th century, and the river Nadym was noted in published form at the turn of the 17th and 18th Centuries in the \"Drawing Book of Siberia\" by Russian geographer, cartographer and topographer, Semyon Remezov and sons, composed in 1699–1701. On the map of Tobolsk province of 1802, Nadym was already marked as having significant population. Today it's located 32 kilometers from the mouth of the river Nadym, referred to as Nadym mound.\n\nIn 1929, a reindeer farm called \"Nadym\" was founded on the right bank of the river Nadym. However, in 1934 the farm was disbanded and turned into a factory.\n\nIn the fall of 1967, it was chosen as the reference framework for the development of a regional gas bearing deposit. Surrounded by numerous lakes, the village situated on an elevated dry place was chosen for a runway for the airline industry. Relatively small, 12 kilometers away from the river Nadym, for which it was named, by the 1950s–1960s, the village began to be called \"New Nadym\".\n\nIn parallel to its accelerated pace of development, the gas company created Medvezhye gas field, with the intention of becoming a social and cultural center of the Tyumen North. In August 1971, Nadym held a groundbreaking ceremony for its first major building and on March 9, 1972 by decree of the Soviet First Secretary the industrial community Nadym was incorporated within the Nadymsky Municipal District as Nadym Urban Settlement.\n\nThe main enterprise of the town is \"Nadymgazprom\", it's one of the branches of the Gazprom company.\nwhich accounts for about 11% of gas produced in Russia. Also, the city contains the largest of the independent gas producers \"NOVATEK\" (Yurkharovskoye field).\n\nLarge construction companies are \"Arktikneftegazstroy\", \"Severgazstroi\", \"Nadymdorstroy.\" Until 2010, their number also included the company \"Severtruboprovodstroy\", but in April 2011 it was declared bankrupt. \n\nOf Nadym-based oil and gas production, \"RITEKNadymneft\" (a subsidiary of JSC \"RITEK\") led development of the Sandibinskogo and Mid-Khulymsk oil fields.\n\nNadym experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification \"Dfc\"). The climate is extreme, with temperatures as low as and as high as . On average, however, the region is very cold, with an average temperature of . Precipitation tends to be fairly low; per year, which is heavier in the summer than in the winter.\n\nThe city has nine schools. A high school, a college (Since 2014 PU 4 received the status of college)\nand two art schools.

There are also eight IFK clubs in Finland but they are organised separately. The Swedish IFK was founded 1 February 1895 and has 164 member clubs with around 100,000 members as of 2004. The best known IFK club in football is probably the one in Gothenburg, IFK Göteborg, which won the UEFA Cup twice in the 1980s. In ice hockey, the most successful IFK club is IFK Helsingfors from Helsinki, which have won the Finnish championship seven times.\n\nIFK was founded in Stockholm by two young students (Louis Zettersten and Pehr Ehnemark) that wanted to create a sports association, consisting of a main club in Stockholm with smaller clubs in other parts of the country. This was in a time when no nationwide sports organization or other larger associations existed. An advertisement in the youth paper \"Kamraten\" (The Comrade) that was published 1 February 1895 called forth all sports interested boys and girls in Sweden to join the society. Less than two months later, clubs in Luleå, Härnösand, Uppsala, Jönköping, Gothenburg and Västerås had been founded, aside the main club in Stockholm. It was decided to name the society after the paper that made the creation possible.\n\nThe society grew fast and the administration was too heavy for IFK Stockholm to handle, so a central organisation was created in 1901. Championships and other activities for IFK clubs were arranged and were big tournaments in a time when there existed no central Swedish sports administration to handle nationwide events. Some of these Comrade championships died out as national championships were arranged, but in some sports they live on, for example in Bowling. Other member associations started their own competitions, the most notable being Vasaloppet arranged by IFK Mora and Lidingöloppet arranged by IFK Lidingö.\n\nAside from the IFK members in Sweden and the separately organised IFK members in Finland, there did also exist IFK associations in Denmark and Norway. The last active member in Denmark was IFK Aalborg that ceased to exist in the early 1990s, while the Norwegian member in Kristiania (Oslo) ended its activities early in the 20th century.\n\nIFK's colours are blue and white. They are used by almost all member clubs, and those clubs that do not use them have special permits from the central organisation for using other colours, like IFK Malmö that uses yellow and white or IFK Stockholm's blue and red kits. The colours are believed to symbolise innocence and loyalty as written, by the IFK society master, in \"Kamraten\" in 1899. Symbols used by IFK include the four-pointed star in blue or white, the blue shield with white stripe and the characteristically formed top with two rounded parts between three peaks which can be seen in most of the member clubs' badges, although some use other styles. The IFK flag is described as a blue and white Scandinavian cross on white background with a blue four-pointed star in the canton.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The lake was created in 1963 by the Smith Mountain Dam impounding the Roanoke River. The majority of the south shore of the lake lies in Franklin County while a small portion, including access to the dam, lies in Pittsylvania County. Bedford County makes up the northern half of the lake with the Roanoke River as the dividing line. The lake has become a popular recreation spot and has also experienced significant development in the last decade. It is the largest lake contained entirely within the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nInitial proposals were made in the late 1920s to dam the Roanoke River and the Blackwater River at the Smith Mountain gorge to generate electricity. Construction on the Smith Mountain Dam began in 1960 and was completed in 1963. The lake reached its normal water level in March 1966. The lake covers and has over of shoreline. The north shore of the lake lies entirely in Bedford County.\n\nLocated along the lake shore at Wirtz, Virginia is the Gwin Dudley Home Site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, the area around Smith Mountain Lake remained rural and remote with tobacco farms and other agriculture. Marinas provided the bulk of public access in the early years of the lake. The limited early residential developments around the lake consisted largely of small trailer parks and modest houses. However, residential growth has been steady since the mid-1980s and increasingly upscale with large lakefront houses, condominiums, and communities centered on golf courses. The lake has attracted many who commute to Roanoke and Lynchburg and many retirees, many of whom have relocated from the Northeast. By the late 1990s, the number and affluence of the new residents resulted in the construction of new retail and commercial developments near the lake. Recent shoreline development has been limited to residential construction. With the enactment of Federal oversight of shoreline development in 1998 coupled with soaring real estate values, there is an escalating loss of public access to the lake as the lake's marinas are sold for residential development.\n\nState Route 122 is the only primary highway that crosses the lake, though State Route 24, State Route 116, and State Route 40 are nearby.\n\nAmerican Electric Power (AEP) is licensed to operate the Smith Mountain Project by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The initial license term was for fifty years. In 1998, AEP began the process of relicensing. Under the requirements of relicensing, AEP was required to perform numerous studies to determine management requirements during the upcoming license term. In December, 2009 the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Appalachian Power a new license to operate the hydro-electricity plant. The new 30-year license replaces the original 50-year license and addresses recreational and environmental management.\n\nIn 1998, the FERC required AEP to devise and implement a shoreline management plan. The Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) limits the development of all property within the \"project boundary.\" Local zoning regulations have been effectively superseded by the SMP regulations. AEP acts as the permitting agency. Any variance requests are reviewed by interested State and Federal agencies such as Virginia Dept of Game and Inland Fisheries. Disagreements must first proceed to the FERC, then be appealed through the Federal Judicial System.\n\nThe area lies in a broad valley nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of rural south-central Virginia. Before the lake's creation, farming and logging were the primary industries. Communities around the lake include Moneta, Huddleston, Union Hall, White House, Penhook and Goodview. There is a post office located at 1080 Tolers Ferry Rd, Huddleston, VA 24104. The Booker T. Washington National Monument is near the west end of the lake.\n\nThe level of the lake normally varies by during the day and night, as water flows through (and is pumped back through) the dam. The normal maximum level of the lake (also known as \"full pond\") is regulated to above sea level. The normal observed level (also known as \"normal pond\") is . The level can be significantly lower during periods of extended drought. Lake levels were sometimes about below normal during the years 2001 to 2003, after five years of below-average rainfall.\n\nSmith Mountain Lake has become a popular recreational area. Boating, water skiing, wakeboarding, riding personal watercraft, and sailing are common activities as is fishing, especially for striped bass. The lake has hosted several professional fishing tournaments. Smith Mountain Lake State Park opened in 1983 and provided a beach and a section for swimming. Golf at one of the four nearby courses is a popular landside activity.\n\nThe majority of access to the lake is through private residential property.

{"id": "1836914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836914", "title": "Red Mass", "text": "Red Mass\n\nA Red Mass is a Mass celebrated annually in the Catholic Church for all members of the legal profession, regardless of religious affiliation: judges, lawyers, law school professors, law students, and government officials, marking the opening of the judicial year. Through prayerful petition and thanksgiving the Red Mass requests guidance from the Holy Spirit for all who seek justice, and offers the legal community an opportunity to reflect on what Catholics believe is the God-given power and responsibility of all in the legal profession.\n\nOriginating in Europe during the High Middle Ages, the Red Mass is so-called from the red vestments traditionally worn in symbolism of the tongues of fire (the Holy Spirit) that descended on the Apostles at Pentecost (). Its name also exemplifies the scarlet robes worn by royal judges that attended the Mass centuries ago.\n\nIn many countries with a Protestant tradition, such as England and Wales and Australia, a similar church service is held to mark the start of the legal year, with judges customarily wearing their ceremonial regalia.\n\nThe first recorded Red Mass was celebrated in the Cathedral of Paris in 1245. In certain localities of France, the Red Mass was celebrated in honor of Saint Ives, the Patron Saint of Lawyers. From there, it spread to most European countries. The tradition began in England around 1310, during the reign of Edward II. It was attended at the opening of each term of Court by all members of the Bench and Bar. Today the Red Mass is celebrated annually at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nIn the United States, the first Red Mass was held in 1877 at Saints Peter and Paul Church Detroit, Michigan, by Detroit College, as the University of Detroit Mercy was known at the time. UDM School of Law resumed the tradition beginning in 1912 and continues to hold it annually. In New York City, a Red Mass was first held in 1928 at the Church of St. Andrew, near the courthouses of Foley Square, celebrated by Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, who strongly advocated and buttressed the legal community's part in evangelization.\n\nIn Canada, the Red Mass was first celebrated in Québec City in 1896, in Toronto in 1924 and in Montréal in 1944. Its sponsorship was assumed by the Guild of Our Lady of Good Counsel in 1931 and by The Thomas More Lawyers' Guild of Toronto since 1968. It was re-instituted in Sydney, Australia in 1931.\n\nThe main difference between the Red Mass and a traditional Mass is that the focus of prayer and blessings concentrate on the leadership roles of those present. The gifts of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel and fortitude, are customarily invoked upon those in attendance.\n\nIn Ireland, the Votive Mass of the Holy Spirit (the Red Mass) is held annually on the first Monday of October, which is the first day of the Michaelmas Law Term. The ceremony is held at St. Michan's Roman Catholic church, which is the parish church of the Four Courts. It is attended by the Irish judiciary, barristers and solicitors, as well as representatives of the diplomatic corps, Gardaí, the Northern Irish, English and Scottish judiciary. The judiciary do not wear their judicial robes, although formal morning dress is worn. Journalist Dearbhail McDonald has described it as \"a grave, necessary reminder of the awesome powers and responsibilities of all those who dispense justice, including judges, lawyers, government and gardaí.\" A parallel ceremony is held at St. Michan's Church of Ireland (Anglican Protestant).\n\nIn the Philippines, De La Salle University, Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan, and other Jesuit schools, and Holy Angel University annually celebrate the Red Mass, which they call \"Mass of the Holy Spirit.\" The University of Santo Tomas, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran (Dominicans), and the San Beda University (Benedictines) also celebrate the Red Mass, known as \"Misa de Apertura\", that is followed by the \"Discurso de Apertura\" to formally open the academic year.\n\nIn Scotland, a Red Mass is held annually each autumn in St. Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh to mark the beginning of the Scottish Judicial year. It is attended by Catholic judges of the High Court of Justiciary, sheriffs, advocates, solicitors and law students all dressed in their robes of office. The robes of the Lords Commissioner of Justiciary are red faced with white.\n\nOne of the better-known Red Masses is the one celebrated each fall at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C. on the Sunday before the first Monday in October (the Supreme Court convenes on the first Monday in October). It is sponsored by the John Carroll Society and attended by some Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, the diplomatic corps, the Cabinet and other government departments and sometimes the President of the United States. Each year, at the Brunch following the Red Mass, the Society confers its Pro Bono Legal Service Awards to thank lawyers and law firms that have provided outstanding service.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish, used to attend the Red Mass with her Christian colleagues but no longer does so due to her objection to the use of images of aborted fetuses during a homily opposing abortion.\n\nThe first Red Mass in the United States was celebrated at Saints Peter and Paul Church (Detroit) in 1877, under the auspices of what is now the University of Detroit Mercy. The tradition was resumed in 1912, and has been held annually since. This Red Mass is the oldest continuously held in the United States. The better-known Red Mass in New York was first celebrated in 1928. The first Red Mass in Boston was celebrated on October 4, 1941 at Immaculate Conception Church under the auspices of Boston College. A Red Mass is also celebrated at St. Joseph's Cathedral in the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, at the University of San Diego, and at the Basilica of the Assumption in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. A Red Mass was first observed in Washington, D.C. in 1939 at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. It continued as an annual event there under the auspices of the law school of the Catholic University of America. It was held in January to coincide with the opening of Congress. In 1953 it was moved to St. Matthew's Cathedral, but continued to be held at the beginning of the year until 1977.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1836932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836932", "title": "Snuff bottle", "text": "Snuff bottle\n\nSnuff bottles were used by the Chinese, Mongolians during the Qing Dynasty to contain powdered tobacco. Smoking tobacco was illegal during the Qing Dynasty, but the use of snuff was allowed because the Chinese considered snuff to be a remedy for common illnesses such as colds, headaches and stomach disorders. Therefore, snuff was carried in a small bottle like other medicines. The snuff bottle replaced the snuff box used by Europeans.\n\nTobacco was introduced by the Portuguese to the court at Beijing some time during the mid- to late-16th century. It was originally smoked in pipes before the establishment of the Qing Dynasty. The use of snuff and snuff bottles spread through the upper class, and by the end of the 17th century it had become a part of social ritual to use snuff. This lasted through most of the 18th century. Eventually, the trend spread into the rest of the country and into every social class. It was common to offer a pinch of snuff as a way to greet friends and relatives. Snuff bottles soon became an object of beauty and a way to represent status and wealth.\n\nThe use of snuff increased and decreased with the rise and fall of the Qing Dynasty and died away soon after the establishment of the Republic of China. However, contemporary snuff bottles are still being made, and can be purchased in souvenir shops, flea markets and museum gift shops. Original snuff bottles from the Qing period are a desirable target for serious collectors and museums. A good bottle has an extra quality over and above its exquisite beauty and value: that is touch. Snuff bottles were made to be held and so, as a rule, they have a pleasant tactile quality.\n\nThe size of a snuff bottle is small enough to fit inside the palm. Snuff bottles were made out of many different materials including porcelain, jade, rhinoceros horn, ivory, wood, tortoiseshell, metal and ceramic, though probably the most commonly used material was glass. The stopper usually had a very small spoon attached for extracting the snuff. Though rare, such bottles were also used by women in Europe in Victorian times, with the bottles typically made of cut glass.\n\nChinese snuff bottles were typically decorated with paintings or carvings, which distinguished bottles of different quality and value. Decorative bottles were, and remain, time-consuming in their production and are thus desirable for today's collectors.\n\nMany bottles are completely devoid of decoration, others are incredibly ornate. As in all Chinese arts and crafts, motifs and symbols play an important part in decorative detail. Symbols are derived from a multitude of sources such as legends, history, religion, philosophy and superstition. The ideas used are almost always directed toward bringing wealth, health, good luck, longevity, even immortality to the owner of an artifact, frequently as a wish expressed in a kind of coded form by the giver of a gift. Probably the most popular decoration is the Shou character, a symbol of happiness and longevity, illustrated at right. Shou or Sau was one of Three Star Gods.\n\nAnother popular device is a representation of the 18 Lohan, who were the personal disciples of Buddha, just one group of the many revered immortals in China. Apart from the 18 Lohan there is a constellation of other divines who are portrayed, even their innards. The eight precious organs of the Buddha are venerated – his heart, gall bladder, spleen, lungs, liver, stomach, kidneys and intestines. These are rarely depicted on snuff bottles. Animals, on the other hand appear with regularity, the most common being the dragon.\n\nThe hare represents a wish for long life and even immortality. In Chinese tradition it is believed that if one attains a sufficiently high standard of morality and enlightenment, one will become one of the immortals.\n\nThe three legged toad is a mythical creature. It was thought to be an animated purse containing an inexhaustible supply of coins, hence it represents wealth and has become a symbol of the unattainable.\n\nThe fish is both an emblem of wealth and abundance and of harmony and connubial bliss. The fish emblem is used in a variety of decorative ways. Bamboo is a frequent motif. Because of its durability and its being evergreen it has come, along with many other symbols, to signify longevity.\n\n \"Inside painted\" are glass bottles which have pictures and often calligraphy painted on the inside surface of the glass.\n\nTheir scenes are an inch or two high and are painted while manipulating the brush through the neck of the bottle at times only a quarter inch across, in reverse. Ursula Bourne, in her treatise on snuff, suggested that artisans painted on their backs to make it easier to work through the narrow opening. \nA skilled artist may complete a simple bottle in a week while something special may take a month or more and the best craftsmen will produce only a few bottles in a year.\n\nGan Xuanwen, also known as Gan Xuan has long been recognized as an important early artist of inside-painted snuff bottles in China. Quite a number of his bottles carry cyclical dates together with a reign period, and hence his works can be dated for certainty to roughly the first quarter of the 19th century, during the late Jiaqing (1796-1820) and early Daoguang (1821-1850) reigns of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). \n\nIt was not until the early 19th century and late in the Jiaqing reign that snuff bottles decorated with inside painting came to the fore. The inspiration of inside-painted snuff bottles might have originated from the court, but did not receive any support of the imperial workshops. Nevertheless, this kind of snuff bottles quickly became the subject of acquisition for a new group of patrons, comprising officials, nobles, scholars and businessmen. Eventually the craft gained immense momentum in the late Qing and the early Republic periods, i.e. from the late 19th to the early 20th centuries. In Beijing, there were three renowned and influential masters, namely Zhou Leyuan, Ma Shaoxuan and Ye Zhongsan. Inside painted bottles are still made extensively for collectors and inexpensively as souvenirs.\n\nInside painted bottles themes include landscapes, bird-and-flowers, figures and auspicious themes. They are viewed as miniature paintings within the bottle.\n\nIn recent years a popular method of snuff insufflation has been the snuff bullet. A simple snuff bullet consists of a small bottle with a plug in the base, a rotatable \"dosing chamber\" and a hole on the top. More advanced snuff bullets have variable dosing settings. They can be made of plastic, glass or metal.\n\n"}
{"id": "1836941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836941", "title": "Dudley Saltonstall", "text": "Dudley Saltonstall\n\nDudley Saltonstall (1738–1796) was an American naval commander during the American Revolutionary War. He is best known as the commander of the naval forces of the 1779 Penobscot Expedition, which ended in complete disaster, with all ships lost. Norton (2003) argues the Penobscot Expedition was a total failure due to poor planning, inadequate training, and timid leadership on the part of Saltonstall.\n\nDudley Saltonstall was born in 1738 to Gurdon Saltonstall Jr and Mary Winthrop. Both sides of his family were prominent in British colonial politics; his great-grandfather on his father's side was Sir Richard Saltonstall, and his mother was descended from John Winthrop, who served as governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the 17th century. His father was a prominent figure in New London and Connecticut politics, serving as a probate judge and a leader of the community. In 1765 he married Frances Babcock, the daughter of Joshua Babcock, a doctor and lawyer who served on the supreme court of the Rhode Island Colony.\n\nSaltonstall took positions on the ships of the colonial mercantile fleet, and served as a merchant captain during the Seven Years' War. In April 1762 he was given command of a letter of marque brigantine, the \"Britannia\", with which he made several successful voyages to the West Indies. During these years he established a reputation as a competent ship's captain.\n\nWhen the American Revolutionary War broke out, Saltonstall joined Connecticut's militia, helping to defend New London's harbor. When the Continental Navy was established, he was given one of the first captain's commissions, based on the recommendation of his brother-in-law Silas Deane, who served on Connecticut's Naval Committee. He was given command of , the flagship of the new navy's commodore, Esek Hopkins. He hired John Paul Jones as his first lieutenant, and gave him the responsibility of overseeing the fitting out of the newly acquired ship. He and Jones did not get along well, as Jones did not like Saltonstall's sometimes distant and superior demeanor.\n\nSaltonstall captained \"Alfred\" on the Continental Navy's maiden voyage in March 1776, an expedition to Nassau in the Bahamas whose objective was arms and critically needed gunpowder. The expedition was somewhat successful, as Nassau was taken, but its governor had managed to remove much of the gunpowder before the takeover was completed. The return voyage was uneventful, although smallpox was spreading through the ships' crews, until the fleet neared Block Island. On April 4 and 5, the fleet captured British ships. On the morning of April 6, was spotted, and was brought to action. In the ensuing battle, \"Alfred\" steering controls were damaged by cannon fire, and she drifted out of the action. \"Glasgow\" was able to escape to Newport outrunning the heavily laden fleet.\n\nWhile the expedition was successful, Hopkins and Saltonstall were questioned over the fleet's failure to follow its stated orders, which had been to engage the British fleet off the Carolinas, and over its failure to capture the clearly outnumbered \"Glasgow\". Saltonstall was not censured, but other captains in the fleet were punished for cowardly behavior.\n\nIn September 1776 Saltonstall was given command of , which had been built at a dockyard on the Connecticut River. To Saltonstall's dismay, she was too heavily laden to cross the sand bar at the mouth of the river. After numerous repeated attempts to pass the bar in 1776 and 1777, the Marine Committee gave her command to Elisha Hinman, who successfully floated her into Long Island Sound in August 1779.\n\nSaltonstall's next command was , based in Boston. He replaced Hopkins at her helm in July 1779; Hopkins was suspended for breach of orders, and was eventually dismissed from the navy.\n\nIn the summer of 1779, the British established a base in Penobscot Bay near present-day Castine, Maine, intended to be the beginning of a new province, New Ireland, and a stronghold for attacking American privateers operating against British shipping.\n\nThe state of Massachusetts (which at that time included the District of Maine), organized an expedition to dislodge the British from this position. Saltonstall, the senior Continental Navy commander, was given command of the naval forces, which consisted primarily of ships from the Massachusetts State Navy, a large number of privateers, and a few Continental Navy ships, including \"Warren\". Command of the land forces accompanying the expedition was given to a relatively inexperienced Massachusetts militia brigadier general, Solomon Lovell.\n\nThe unwieldy fleet had virtually no captains with experience in any sort of fleet operations, and many of them were used to the independence afforded by their privateering operations. While Saltonstall had participated in the Nassau expedition, he had only exercised command over his ship. Furthermore, the expedition was to be his maiden voyage aboard his new command. The expedition sailed for Penobscot Bay on July 19. When it arrived near the British base, commanders of the various forces met to consider their attack in a council that was later described by Paul Revere, the militia's artillery leader, as \"more like a meeting in a Coffee House than a council of War\". Nothing of consequence was agreed, and the resultant lack of coordination between the various forces proved disastrous. Saltonstall and Lovell disagreed on tactics, and Saltonstall refused to take steps to engage the three British ships that were anchored near the fort in somewhat treacherous waters. He finally engaged Henry Mowat's small fleet at long range on June 29; his inexperienced gunnery crews did little damage, while Mowat's did significant damage to \"Warren\" and other ships. This made Saltonstall reluctant to order further engagements, including in support of land and amphibious operations. The arrival of a British relief fleet under Admiral George Collier at the mouth of the bay led to further strains. Saltonstall at first set up a line of defense against the arriving fleet, but when they began to close, he essentially ordered each ship to act independently, and the fleet organization dissolved. Most of the ships were eventually grounded and burned; some were captured after brief exchanges by the British. The land forces were essentially abandoned, and many men had to make lengthy overland treks back to civilization.\n\nSaltonstall's reported inaction and timidity were blamed for the failure of the expedition. This may have been an unfair judgement, as few people understood the technological and nautical limitations Saltonstall faced. Other ship captains in the expedition overwhelmingly agreed that a naval assault was too risky without a simultaneous land attack on the British fort, which Lovell refused to provide. On September 7, 1779, a Warrant for Court Martial was issued by the Navy Board, Eastern Department, against Saltonstall. He was found guilty at the trial of ineptitude at Penobscot and was dismissed from the Navy as being \"ever after incompetent to hold a government office or state post\" the following October by the \"Committee for Enquiring into the Failure of the Penobscot Expedition\" of the Massachusetts General Court which determined that failure of the expedition was primarily the result of the \"want of proper Spirit and Energy on the part of the Commodore\", that he \"discouraged any Enterprizes or offensive [attack] Measures on the part of our Fleet\", and that the total destruction of the fleet was occasioned \"principally by the Commodore's not exerting himself at all at the time of the Retreat in opposing the Enemies' foremost Ships in pursuit.\"\n\nThe story of the Penobscot Expedition forms the basis of the historical novel, \"The Fort\" by Bernard Cornwell.\n\nSaltonstall returned to Connecticut, and convinced one of his wife's relatives, Adam Babcock, to support him in a privateering venture. As captain of the 16-gun brig \"Minerva\", he embarked on a successful career as a privateer in 1781. Among his prizes was the richest captured by a Connecticut ship; the British ship \"Hannah\" was valued at £80,000.\n\nAfter the war, he engaged in trade with the West Indies, and also dabbled in the slave trade. He died in 1796 in the West Indies, apparently of a tropical disease.\n\n"}

The show first aired on CBS on September 22, 1995, and was canceled after a single season on July 11, 1996.\n\nThe story takes place in the fictional town of Trinity, South Carolina, and revolves around Caleb Temple (Lucas Black) and the town's corrupt sheriff, Lucas Buck (Gary Cole). Though appearing affable and charismatic, Sheriff Buck is a murderous rapist whose power base is backed by apparent supernatural powers, which he generally uses to manipulate people to \"fulfill their potential\" and make life-changing choices (usually for evil).\n\nCaleb Temple is a normal child whose paternity masks a horrific secret: Lucas Buck is his biological father, having raped his mother in front of Caleb's older sister Merlyn (Sarah Paulson). The horror of watching her mother being sexually assaulted caused Merlyn to become severely emotionally traumatized and withdrawn from the rest of the world, made even worse when her mother committed suicide after giving birth to Caleb.\n\nDuring the pilot episode of the series, Sheriff Buck murders Merlyn in cold blood and manipulates Caleb's \"father\" (Sonny Shroyer) into committing suicide in order to eliminate Caleb's family and claim his biological son for his own. However, the newly arrived Dr. Crower (Jake Weber) begins to uncover the sheriff's role in the death of Merlyn and Merlyn's father and, with help from Caleb's out-of-town cousin Gail Emory (Paige Turco), struggles to prevent Lucas from corrupting young Caleb. They are aided in part by Merlyn's ghost, who personally appears before Caleb throughout the series in order to try to keep him from Buck's corrupt grasp.\n\nNote: The character of Dr. Billy Peale (John Mese) was a late addition to the series, intended to be a regular character to replace Dr. Matt Crower as a more formidable adversary to Lucas Buck. He was added to the opening credits in the episode \"Doctor Death Takes a Holiday\", in which Dr. Crower is written out. Producer Shaun Cassidy stated that Dr. Crower would have returned had the show been renewed for a second season.\n\nCBS originally aired American Gothic in a differing sequence than the production order and omitted four episodes (\"Potato Boy\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Echo of Your Last Goodbye\" and \"Strangler\") from its network broadcast.

Written by Christopher Knopf and directed by Herbert Wise, the film stars Albert Finney, Caroline Bliss, Brian Cox, and John Forgeham. The film marks both Albert Finney's American television debut and the first script Finney had ever turned down upon initial reading.\n\nThis film's timeline begins with the death of Pope John Paul I on September 28, 1978, and then flashes back to Karol Wojtyła as a young man growing up decades earlier in Wadowice, Poland. The storyline then returns to pre-October 16 dates in 1978 and flashes back to Wojtyła's early life, family relationships, his political involvements fighting against Nazism during World War II and against Communism after the war, and his relationship and involvement in the Roman Catholic Church as he becomes a priest, a bishop, a cardinal, and is eventually installed as the titular new pope.\n\nOnce Karol Wojtyła was installed as Pope, executive producer Alvin Cooperman made his decision to create the film project, and with the assistance of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, sought Vatican approval and cooperation. After reviewing the script, the Vatican welcomed the project.\n\nBritish actor Michael Compton portrayed Karol Wojtyła from ages 18 through 26, and Albert Finney portrayed Wojtyła from 27 years old, up to the time the former bishop was installed as Pope John Paul II. Finney had initially declined the role upon first reading the script, as he felt playing the role of someone so high-profile would be unnerving, but after re-reading the script, he accepted. Deciding that then-political problems in Poland would make shooting there problematical, producer Alvin Cooperman received permission to shoot in Yugoslavia, using Zagreb to represent Kraków. Three days before major filming was to commence, the Yugoslavian government rescinded permission and confiscated location footage that had already been shot. The production company was told they were not welcome due to the script's anti-Communist overtones as set by Wojtyła's disagreements with the Communist regime while he was a priest, cardinal and bishop. The project was subsequently filmed at locations in Austria, as well as in Italy in Caprarola and Rome.\n\nThe film debuted on CBS Television on Easter Sunday, April 22, 1984.\n\n\"The Day\" wrote that in their considering the difficulties in offering a project about an incumbent Pope, the filmmakers treated the subject \"with verve - and honesty\". In not being a true documentary film, the depiction of the life of Karol Wojtyła was not \"tied to exact factual details\", and included the addition \"theatrical flourishes and appropriate emotional atmosphere\", but still remained \"a sound and vivid dramatization\" reflecting the biographical record of a man whose \"background had plenty of high drama in it without making it up\". They did note that \"some of the transitions were a bit ragged, and some of the ecclesiastical artificially stiff,\" but that \"generally, the story has authenticity\".\n\n\"The Courier\" in noting that lead Albert Finney was Protestant, both director Herbert Wise and writer Christopher Knopf were Jewish, and cinematographer Tony Imi was Roman Catholic, wrote that the film was successful as \"a compelling story about a man, rather that a religious tract about a pontiff.\" Producer Alvin Cooperman spoke toward the difficulties extant in writing about a living exalted person, and how he worked to dispel preconceptions that he was offering either a documentary or a \"hallowed portrait\" of (then-incumbent) John Paul II.\n\n\"The New York Times\" made note of difficulties inherent in creating a film about a historical person while the person is living. The offered that while a person might be mythicized after their death, and might even be so when living, it is when they are living when they are living that a production company has boundaries, as \"current images, common knowledge, popular consensus shape them.\" They wrote that this project was \"at once enhanced and hindered by this.\" They granted that while Pope John Paul II's life story \"is sure-fire for a biography\", and viewers would likely have their own views and impressions of him, but that with his being a living subject, when it comes to historical accuracy, \"A filmmaker can tamper with this only lightly, not only because heavy tampering would be distasteful, even irreverent, but because it would be jarring, an assault on our sensibilities.\" In the production company respecting this, the film becomes \"almost a series of anecdotes.\"\n\n\"Boston Globe\" made note that director Herbert Wise's choice of flashback to tell the story made the timeline easy to follow and allowed him to \"introduce scenes from Wojtyła's early life in black and white.\" They applauded makeup artists for their making actor Albert Finney look \"eerily like the Pope\", and the actor himself for mastering \"the Pope's stoop and his hand gestures\". They found that in the director portraying \"Wojtyła as a man without a flaw\", the story itself was \"without a moral dilemma and, therefore, without dramatic edge\".\n\nAllRovi wrote that the screenplay by Christopher Knopf was \"written with reverence and intelligence\". The film received a 1985 WGA Awards nomination for writer Christopher Knopf for 'Original Drama Anthology'.\n"}

He is best known for leading several invasions of Spanish Florida during Queen Anne's War, including attacks in 1704 and 1706 which wiped out most of the Spanish missions in Florida. He captured and brought back to Carolina as slaves thousands of Apalachee Indians.\n\nLittle is known of Moore's origins. During his life he was said to be a son of Roger Moore (also known as Rory O'Moore or Ruairí Óg Ó Mórdha), leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and that he had supposedly inherited his father's rebellious nature. He first appears in the records of the Province of Carolina in 1675 representing Margaret Berringer Yeamans, widow of Sir John Yeamans, before the colonial council. At about the same time he married her daughter by her first husband, also named Margaret.\n\nIn 1677, 1682, and 1683, Moore served on the colonial council. He played a leading role in a 1690 expedition into the Carolina back country, crossing the Appalachian Mountains to investigate possibilities of trade with the local Indian population. In 1698 he was elected to the colonial assembly, and was described as the right-hand-man of proprietor Sir John Colleton. The next year he was named chief justice of the colony, a post he held until he was named governor in 1700, replacing the deceased Joseph Blake.\nMoore was a leader of one of colonial South Carolina's political factions, called the \"Goose Creek Men\", after Goose Creek, an outlying area of Charleston.\n\nIn 1683 Moore was granted by the Lords Proprietors. He called his estate \"Boochowee\". Part of this land is known today as Liberty Hall Plantation.\n\nFrom 1691 Moore was the acknowledged leader of the Goose Creek Men, the main political opposition to the ruling \"Dissenter\" faction. Moore's rise to governorship in 1700 signalled a major shift in the politics of the colony. The Dissenters contested Moore's \"unjust election\". But the Lords Proprietors saw to it that Moore remained governor, and they made it clear that the Dissenters were no longer in favor.\n\nBetween 1700 and 1703 Moore was the British governor of Carolina, which was then in the process of dividing into the provinces of North and South Carolina. During this period, he led a number of attacks from the Carolinas into Spanish Florida. He relied on allied Indian tribes, especially the Yamasee for most of his military force. On news of the outbreak of Queen Anne's War in 1702, he led 500 colonists, 300 native allies, and 14 small ships on an invasion of Spanish Florida along the coast, destroying the remaining Spanish missionary Indians of Guale and Mocama, and devastating the lands around St. Augustine. While the town of St. Augustine was razed, its central fortress, Castillo de San Marcos, where the Spanish and numerous allied Indians had taken refuge, resisted Moore's siege. The 1702 campaign was viewed as a disaster due to the failure to take the fortress and the expenses incurred, and Moore resigned his post.\n\nIn 1704, Moore led an expedition of 50 Englishmen and 1,000 Creek, Yamasee, and other allied Indians, into western Florida, leading to the Apalachee Massacre. The Apalachee were the last powerful Spanish-allied Indian nation in the region. Their defeat in 1704 resulted in many Apalachee being enslaved and taken from Charleston to the West Indies. Other Apalachee were relocated (some voluntarily, others not) to the Savannah River to live in semi-serfdom. Another result of the defeat of the Apalachee was the collapse of the final defence of the Indians of Florida. In the following years, Carolinian and Indian slave raiders virtually wiped out the Indian population of Florida all the way to the Florida Keys.\n\nMoore's defeat of the Apalachee in Spanish Florida was hailed as a major victory for Carolina, which had been fighting with the Spanish for control of the region for decades. It also served to strengthen ties between various southeastern Indians and Carolina. The Creek people and the Cherokees became much more closely allied with Carolina. With these two Indian nations as strong allies, the English rose to a position of dominance over the French and Spanish in the American southeast.\n\nMoore died in 1706 of a tropical disease, possibly yellow fever. He was significantly in debt. His son by the same name was elected to the same office in 1719 following the overthrow of the proprietary governor.\n\nMoore married Margaret Berringer, daughter of Lady Margaret Yeamans (by a previous marriage). Their daughter, Mary Moore, married Job Howe, another of the \"Goose Creek Men\". Altogether James and Margaret had ten children, many of whom moved to the Lower Cape Fear region, where they and their descendants became known as \"The Family\", the most powerful family in the region. Moore was the grandfather of American Revolutionary War Brigadier General James Moore, and great-grandfather of Major General Robert Howe.\n\nThe Moore family imported over 4,000 slaves into the Carolinas, mostly for its own extensive plantations and farms in and around the Cape Fear area of what later became North Carolina. James Moore also had a house in Charleston and another in the Goose Creek area near Charleston.\n\nAnother Moore family descendant, Alfred Moore, became a Justice of the US Supreme Court.\n\nNathaniel Moore (son of Rory Oge O'More)\n\n"}

Relaxation techniques are often employed as one element of a wider stress management program and can decrease muscle tension, lower the blood pressure and slow heart and breath rates, among other health benefits.\n\nPeople respond to stress in different ways, namely, by becoming overwhelmed, depressed or both. Yoga, QiGong, Taiji, and Pranayama that includes deep breathing tend to calm people who are overwhelmed by stress, while rhythmic exercise improves the mental and physical health of those who are depressed. People who encounter both symptoms simultaneously, feeling depressed in some ways and overexcited in others, may do best by walking or performing yoga techniques that are focused on strength.\n\nResearch has indicated that removing stress helps to increase a person's health.\n\nResearch released in the 1980s indicated stronger ties between stress and health and showed benefits from a wider range of relaxation techniques than had been previously known. This research received national media attention, including a \"New York Times\" article in 1986.\n\nPeople use relaxation techniques for the following reasons, among others:\n\nVarious techniques are used by individuals to improve their state of relaxation. Some of the methods are performed alone; some require the help of another person (often a trained professional); some involve movement, some focus on stillness; while other methods involve different elements.\n\nCertain relaxation techniques known as \"formal and passive relaxation exercises\" are generally performed while sitting or lying quietly, with minimal movement and involve \"a degree of withdrawal\". These include:\n\nMovement-based relaxation methods incorporate exercise such as walking, gardening, yoga, T'ai chi, Qigong, and more. Some forms of bodywork are helpful in promoting a state of increased relaxation. Examples include massage, acupuncture, the Feldenkrais Method, myotherapy, reflexology and self-regulation.\n\nSome relaxation methods can also be used during other activities, for example, autosuggestion and prayer. At least one study has suggested that listening to certain types of music, particularly new-age music and classical music, can increase feelings associated with relaxation, such as peacefulness and a sense of ease.\n\nA technique growing in popularity is flotation therapy, which is the use of a float tank in which a solution of Epsom salt is kept at skin temperature to provide effortless floating. Research in USA and Sweden has demonstrated a powerful and profound relaxation after twenty minutes. In some cases, floating may reduce pain and stress and has been shown to release endorphins.\n\nEven actions as simple as a walk in the park have been shown to aid feelings of relaxation, regardless of the initial reason for the visit.\n\n"}

Dobiński, who published it in 1877.\n\nIn the setting of probability theory, Dobiński's formula represents the \"n\"th moment of the Poisson distribution with mean 1. Sometimes Dobiński's formula is stated as saying that the number of partitions of a set of size \"n\" equals the \"n\"th moment of that distribution.\n\nThe computation of the sum of Dobiński's series can be reduced to a finite sum of \"n+o(n)\" terms, taking into account the information that formula_3 is an integer.

The name \"Islamic\" Cairo refers not to a greater prominence of Muslims in the area but rather to the city's rich history and heritage since its foundation in the early period of Islam, while distinguishing it from with the nearby Ancient Egyptian sites of Giza and Memphis. This area holds one of the largest and densest concentrations of historic architecture in the Islamic world. It is characterized by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from throughout the Islamic era of Egypt. In 1979, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed \"Historic Cairo\" a World Cultural Heritage site, as \"one of the world's oldest Islamic cities, with its famous mosques, madrasas, hammams and fountains\" and \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"\n\nThe history of Cairo begins, in essence, with the conquest of Egypt by Muslim Arabs in 640, under the commander 'Amr ibn al-'As. Although Alexandria was the capital of Egypt at that time (and had been throughout the Ptolemaic, Roman, and Byzantine periods), the Arab conquerors decided to establish a new city called Fustat to serve as the administrative capital and military garrison center of Egypt. The new city was located near a Roman-Byzantine fortress known as Babylon on the shores of the Nile (now located in Old Cairo), southwest of the later site of Cairo proper (see below). The choice of this location may have been due to several factors, including its slightly closer proximity to Arabia and Mecca, the fear of strong remaining Christian and Hellenistic influence in Alexandria, and Alexandria's vulnerability to Byzantine counteroffensives arriving by sea (which did indeed occur). Perhaps even more importantly, the location of Fustat at the intersection of Lower Egypt (the Nile Delta) and Upper Egypt (the Nile Valley further south) made it a strategic place from which to control a country that was centered on the Nile river, much as the Ancient Egyptian city of Memphis (located just south of Cairo today) had done. (The pattern of founding new garrison cities inland was also one that was repeated throughout the Arab conquests, with other examples such as Qayrawan in Tunisia or Kufa in Iraq.) The foundation of Fustat was also accompanied by the foundation of Egypt's (and Africa's) first mosque, the Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As, which has been much rebuilt over the centuries but still exists today.\n\nFustat quickly grew to become Egypt's main city, port, and economic center, with Alexandria becoming more of a provincial city. In 661 the Islamic world came under the control of the Ummayyads, based in their capital at Damascus, until their overthrow by the Abbasids in 750. The last Ummayyad caliph, Marwan II, made his last stand in Egypt but was killed on August 1st, 750. Thereafter Egypt, and Fustat, passed under Abbasid control. The Abbasids marked their new rule in Egypt by founding a new administrative capital called al-'Askar, slightly northeast of Fustat, under the initiative of their governor Abu 'Aun. The city was completed with the foundation of a grand mosque (called \"Jami' al-'Askar\") in 786, and included a palace for the governor's residence, known as the \"Dar al-'Imara.\" Nothing of this city remains today, but the foundation of new administrative capitals just outside the main city became a recurring pattern in the history of the area. Ahmad Ibn Tulun was a Turkish military commander who had served the Abbasid caliphs in Samarra during a long crisis of Abbasid power. He became governor of Egypt in 868 but quickly became its \"de facto\" independent ruler, while still acknowledging the Abbasid caliph's symbolic authority. He grew so influential that the caliph later allowed him to also take control of Syria in 878. During this period of Tulunid rule (under Ibn Tulun and his sons), Egypt became an independent state for the first time since Roman rule was established in 30 BC. Ibn Tulun founded his own new administrative capital in 870, called al-Qata'i, just northwest of al-Askar. It included a new grand palace (still called \"Dar al-'Imara\"), a hippodrome or military parade ground, amenities such as a hospital (bimaristan), and a great mosque which survives to this day, known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, built between 876 and 879. Ibn Tulun died in 884 and his sons ruled for a few more decades until 905 when the Abbasids sent an army to reestablish direct control and burned al-Qata'i to the ground, sparing only the mosque. After this, Egypt was ruled for a while by another dynasty, the Ikhshidids, who ruled as Abbasid governors between 935 and 969. Some of their constructions, particularly under Abu al-Misk Kafur, a black eunuch (originally from Ethiopia) who ruled as regent during the later part of this period, may have influenced the future Fatimids' choice of location for their capital, since one of Kafur's great gardens along the Khalij canal was incorporated into the later Fatimid palaces.\n\nThe Fatimids, an Isma'ili Shi'a caliphate which was based in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), conquered Egypt in 969 CE during the reign of Caliph al-Mu'izz. Their army, composed mostly of North African Kutama Berbers, was led by the general Jawhar al-Siqilli. In 970, under instructions from al-Mu'izz, Jawhar planned, founded, and constructed a new city to serve as the residence and center of power for the Fatimid Caliphs. The city was named \"al-Mu'izziyya al-Qaahirah\", the \"Victorious City of al-Mu'izz\", later simply called \"al-Qahira\", which gave us the modern name of Cairo. \n\nThe city was located northeast of Fustat and of the previous administrative capitals built by Ibn Tulun and the Abbasids. Jawhar organized the new city so that at its center were the Great Palaces that housed the caliphs, their household, and the state's institutions. Two main palaces were completed: an eastern one (the largest of the two) and a western one, between which was an important plaza known as \"Bayn al-Qasrayn\" (\"Between the Two Palaces\"). The city's main mosque, the Mosque of al-Azhar, was founded in 972 as both a Friday mosque and as a center of learning and teaching, and is today considered one of the oldest universities in the world. The city's main street, known today as \"Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah\" Street (or al-Mu'zz street) but historically referred to as the \"Qasabah\" or Qasaba, ran from one of the northern city gates (Bab al-Futuh) to the southern gate (Bab Zuweila) and passed between the palaces via Bayn al-Qasrayn. Under the Fatimids, however, Cairo was a royal city which was closed to the common people and inhabited only by the Caliph's family, state officials, army regiments, and other people necessary to the operations of the regime and its city. Fustat remained for some time the main economic and urban center of Egypt. It was only later that Cairo grew to absorb other local cities, including Fustat, but the year 969 is sometimes considered the \"founding year\" of the current city.\n\nAl-Mu'izz, and with him the administrative apparatus of the Fatimid Caliphate, left his former capital of Mahdia, Tunisia, in 972 and arrived in Cairo in June 973. The Fatimid Empire quickly grew powerful enough to stand as a threat to the rival Sunni Abbasid Caliphate. During the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (1036-1094), the longest of any Muslim ruler, the Fatimid Empire reached its peak but also began its decline. A few strong viziers, acting on behalf of the caliphs, managed to revive the empire's power on occasion. The Armenian vizier Badr al-Jamali (in office from 1073-1094) notably rebuilt the walls of Cairo in stone, with monumental gates, the remains of which still stand today and were expanded under later Ayyubid rule. The late 11th century was also a time of major events and developments in the region. It was at this time that the Great Seljuk (Turkish) Empire took over much of the eastern Islamic world. The arrival of the Turks, who were mainly Sunni Muslims, was a long-term factor in the so-called \"Sunni Revival\" which reversed the advance of the Fatimids and of Shi'a factions in the Middle East. In 1099 the First Crusade captured Jerusalem, and the new Crusader states became a sudden and serious threat to Egypt. New Muslim rulers such as Nur al-Din of the Turkish Zengid dynasty took charge of the overall offensive against the Crusaders. \n\nIn the 12th century the weakness of the Fatimids became so severe that under the last Fatmid Caliph, al-'Adid, they requested help from the Zengids to protect themselves from the King of Jerusalem, Amalric, while at the same time attempting to collude with the latter to keep the Zengids in check. In 1168, as the Crusaders marched on Cairo, the Fatimid vizier Shawar, worried that the unfortified city of Fustat would be used as a base from which to besiege Cairo, ordered its evacuation and then set the city ablaze. While historians debate the extent of the destruction (as Fustat appears to have continued to exist after this), the burning of Fustat nonetheless marks a pivotal moment in the decline of that city, which was later eclipsed by Cairo itself. Eventually, Salah ad-Din (Saladin), a Zengid commander who was given the position of al-'Adid's vizier in Cairo, declared the end and dismantlement of the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171. Cairo thus returned to Sunni rule, and a new chapter in the history of Egypt, and of Cairo's urban history, opened.\n\nSalah ad-Din's reign marked the beginning of the Ayyubid dynasty, which ruled over Egypt and Syria and carried forward the fight against the Crusaders. He also embarked on the construction of an ambitious new fortified Citadel (the current Citadel of Cairo) further south, outside the walled city, which would house Egypt's rulers and state administration for many centuries thereafter. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by common Egyptians and open to foreign travelers. Over the subsequent centuries, Cairo developed into a full-scale urban center. The decline of Fustat over the same period paved the way for its ascendance. The Ayyubid sultans and their Mamluk successors, who were Sunni Muslims eager to erase the influence of the Shi'a Fatimids, progressively demolished and replaced the great Fatimid palaces with their own buildings. The Al-Azhar Mosque was converted to a Sunni institution, and today it is the foremost center for the study of the Qur'an and Islamic law in the Sunni Islamic world.\n\nIn 1250 the Ayyubid dynasty faltered and power transitioned to a regime controlled by the Mamluks. The mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves (often from various regions of Central Eurasia) and raised to serve in the army of the sultan. They became a mainstay of the Ayyubid military under Sultan al-Salih and eventually became powerful enough to assume control of the state for themselves in a political crisis during the Seventh Crusade. Between 1250 and 1517, the throne passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. Nonetheless, the Mamluk Empire continued many aspects of the Ayyubid Empire before it, and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols in 1260 (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut) and for putting a final end to the Crusader states in the Levant. \n\nUnder the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293-1341, including interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. A commonly-cited estimate of the population towards the end of his reign, although difficult to evaluate, gives a figure of about 500,000, making Cairo the largest city in the world outside China at the time. Despite being a largely military caste, the Mamluks were prolific builders and sponsors of religious and civic buildings. An extensive number of Cairo's historical monuments date from their era, including many of the most impressive. The city also prospered from the control of trade routes between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. After the reign of al-Nasir, however, Egypt and Cairo were struck by repeated epidemics of the plague, starting with the Black Death in the mid-14th century. Cairo's population declined and took centuries to recover, but it remained the major metropolis of the Middle East.\n\nUnder the Ayyubids and the later Mamluks, the Qasaba avenue became a privileged site for the construction of religious complexes, royal mausoleums, and commercial establishments, usually sponsored by the sultan or members of the ruling class. This is also where the major souqs of Cairo developed, forming its main economic zone of international trade and commercial activity. As the main street became saturated with shops and space for further development there ran out, new commercial structures were built further east, close to al-Azhar Mosque and to the shrine of al-Hussein, where the souq area of Khan al-Khalili, still present today, progressively developed. One important factor in the development of Cairo's urban character was the growing number of \"waqf\" establishments, especially during the Mamluk period. Waqfs were charitable trusts under Islamic law which set out the function, operations, and funding sources of the many religious/civic establishments built by the ruling elite. They were typically drawn up to define complex religious or civic buildings which combined various functions (e.g. mosque, madrasa, mausoleum, sabil) and which were often funded with revenues from urban commercial buildings or rural agricultural estates. By the late 15th century Cairo also had high-rise mixed-use buildings (known as a \"rab\"', a \"khan\" or a \"wikala\", depending on exact function) where the two lower floors were typically for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants.\n\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, under Selim I, and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. During this period, local elites fought ceaselessly among themselves for political power and influence; some of them of Ottoman origin, others from the mamluk caste which continued to exist as part of the country's elites despite the demise of the Mamluk sultanate. \n\nCairo continued to be a major economic center and one of the empire's most important cities. It remained the principal staging point for the pilgrimage (\"Hajj\") route to Mecca. While the Ottoman governors were not major patrons of architecture like the Mamluks, Cairo nonetheless continued to develop and new neighbourhoods did grow outside the old city walls. Ottoman architecture in Cairo continued to be heavily influenced and derived from the local Mamluk-era traditions rather than presenting a clear break with the past. Some individuals, such as Abd ar-Rahman Katkhuda al-Qazdaghli, a mamluk official among the Janissaries in the 18th century, were prolific architectural patrons. Many old bourgeois or aristocratic mansions that have been preserved in Cairo today date from the Ottoman period, as do a number of sabil-kuttabs (a combination of water distribution kiosk and Qur'anic reading school).\n\nNapoleon's French army briefly occupied Egypt from 1798 to 1801, after which an Albanian officer in the Ottoman army named Muhammad Ali Pasha made Cairo the capital of an independent empire that lasted from 1805 to 1882. The city then came under British control until Egypt was granted its independence in 1922.\n\nUnder Muhammad Ali's rule the Citadel of Cairo was completely refurbished. Many of its disused Mamluk monuments were demolished to make way for his new mosque (the Mosque of Muhammad Ali) and other palaces. Muhammad Ali's dynasty also introduced a more purely Ottoman style of architecture, mainly in the late \"Ottoman Baroque\" style of the time. One of his grandsons, Isma'il, as Khedive between 1864 and 1879, oversaw the construction of the modern Suez Canal. Along with this enterprise, he also undertook the construction of a vast new city in European style to the north and west of the historic center of Cairo. The new city emulated Haussman's 19th-century reforms of Paris, with grand boulevards and squares being part of the planning and layout. Although never fully completed to the extent of Isma'il's vision, this new city composes much of Downtown Cairo today. This left the old historic districts of Cairo, including the walled city, relatively neglected. Even the Citadel lost its status as the royal residence when Isma'il moved to the new Abdin Palace in 1874.\n\nWhile the first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Fustat, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque to retain its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture, from the classical period of Islamic civilization. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful.\n\nOne of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaitbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century. Other extant monuments from the Fatimid era include the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the al-Aqmar mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Salih Tala'i.\n\nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts.\n\nIslamic Cairo is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i madhhab, one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others. Some of these shrines are located within the vast cemetery areas known as the City of the Dead or \"al-Qarafa\" in Arabic, which adjoin the historic city. The cemeteries date back to the foundation of Fustat, but many of the most prominent and famous mausoleum structures are from the Mamluk era.\n\nWhen Cairo was founded as palace-city in 969 by the Fatimids, it was enclosed by a circuit of walls. These were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizir Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. The walls were extended and modified by the Ayyubids as part of Salah ad-Din's ambitious plan to protect both Cairo and Fustat by a single set of walls. Parts of these walls were recently excavated next to al-Azhar Park, including some Ayyubid gates like Bab al-Barqiya.\n\nSalah ad-Din (Saladin) began the construction of an extensive Citadel in 1176 to serve as Egypt's seat of power, with construction finishing under his successors. It is located on a promontory of the nearby Muqattam Hills overlooking the city. The Citadel remained the residence of the rulers of Egypt until the late 19th century, and was repeatedly transformed under subsequent rulers. Notably, Muhammad Ali Pasha built the 19th-century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which still dominates the city's skyline from its elevated vantage point.\n\nThe Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built \"wikala\"s (caravanserais; also known as \"khan\"s) to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. The most famous example still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which nowadays also hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe. The famous Khan al-Khalili is a famous souq and commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais. Another example of historic commercial architecture is the 17th-century Qasaba of Radwan Bay, now part of the al-Khayamiyya area whose name comes from the decorative textiles (\"khayamiyya\") still being sold here.\n\nMuch of this historic area suffers from neglect and decay, in this, one of the poorest and most overcrowded areas of the Egyptian capital. In addition, as reported in the Al-Ahram Weekly, thefts of Islamic monuments and artifacts in the Al-Darb al-Ahmar district threaten their long-term preservation.\n\n\n"}

From its founding in the early 1980s until 1999, it was known as the Center for the Arts & Sciences (CAS). During this period, it was a half-day school utilizing a concentration, or major, program to allow students to focus on specialized areas of study, while spending the other half of the day at their home school. In 1999, the name was changed, and SASA became a full day school, allowing students to take other required classes in addition to their concentration.\n\nThe Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy is located in a building that originally housed a Montgomery Ward department store.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the CAS shared its building with the Ruben Daniels Center for Lifelong Education, an adult and alternative high school also run by the Saginaw School district. The CAS met with surprising success, and began drawing students from throughout the Saginaw-valley area, including Saginaw, Bay, and Midland counties.\nIn the late 1990s, a committee of students, parents, and teachers, began a campaign to expand the school to include a full-day option. This committee took on the name \"The River School Project\", owing to the school's location on the banks of the Saginaw River near downtown Saginaw. Although the committee met with much doubt and resistance, support gradually built, and after several meetings the Saginaw School Board eventually unanimously approved plans to expand the school and change the name to the Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy. In 1999, full-day programs were added for the 9th and 10th grade, with the 11th grade following in 2000, and the 12th grade in 2001. \n\nThe school building was renovated to include three new full science labs, an atrium, gymnasium, and a new performing arts center that opened at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1837121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837121", "title": "G. Harry Stine", "text": "G. Harry Stine\n\nGeorge Harry Stine (March 26, 1928 – November 2, 1997) was one of the founding figures of model rocketry, a science and technology writer, and (under the name Lee Correy) a science fiction author.\n\nStine grew up in Colorado Springs and attended New Mexico Military Institute and Colorado College in Colorado Springs, majoring in physics. Upon his graduation he went to work at White Sands Proving Grounds, first as a civilian scientist and then, from 1955–1957, at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Missile Test Facility as head of the Range Operations Division.\n\nStine and his wife Barbara were friends of author Robert A. Heinlein, who sponsored their wedding, as Harry's parents were dead and Barbara's mother too ill to travel. Several of Heinlein's books are dedicated one or both of them, most particularly \"Have Space Suit - Will Travel\". Stine wrote science fiction under the pen name \"Lee Correy\" in the mid-1950s and under his own name in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as writing science articles for Popular Mechanics.\n\nAfter White Sands, Stine was employed at several other aerospace companies, finally ending up at Martin working on the Titan project. This job was short-lived: he was abruptly fired in 1957 when United Press called him for a reaction to the launch of Sputnik 1, and he repeated to them a passage from his just-published book \"Earth Satellites and the Race for Space Superiority\", in which he wrote, \"For the first time since the dawn of history, the Earth is going to have more than one moon. This is due to happen within the next few months—or it may have already happened even at the time you are reading this.\" The next day he was told to clear out his desk.\n\nBack in his days at White Sands he had handled inquiries from young people concerning rockets, and early in 1957 he wrote an article for \"Mechanics Illustrated\" about rocket safety. Shortly thereafter he received a letter from Orville Carlisle, who had begun making small models and, more importantly, replaceable solid fuel engines to power them. Stine was impressed with the samples that Carlisle had sent him, and wrote a cover article for the October \"MI\" issue about them. After the Martin firing, he contacted Carlisle and the two of them formed Model Missiles Inc., the first manufacturer of model rockets and their engines. Stine also founded the National Association of Rocketry (initially called the Model Missile Association) and wrote the safety code which became its centerpiece; he served as its president until the late 1960s.\n\nMMI was short-lived, as they were unprepared to handle the level of business they attracted and because of some poor business decisions. Issues with the production of early engines caused them to seek out Vernon Estes, who came to them in the summer of 1958. Estes's design and construction of \"Mabel\", the first engine-manufacturing machine, was the foundation of his success and put Estes Industries in a dominant position in the hobby which it was never to relinquish.\n\nStine continued to work to popularize the hobby, writing the \"Handbook of Model Rocketry\" in 1965, which went on through seven editions over the years. He returned to the aerospace industry, continuing to write under his pen name, including a Star Trek novel called \"The Abode of Life\" and the original novel \"Shuttle Down\". Under his own name, he was a regular science-fact columnist for Astounding and its later successor Analog, where his intriguing articles were in a position to influence two generations of budding scientists, social thinkers and film artists. He was a consultant to CBS television news during the Apollo program, along with Lindy Davis, Charles Friedlander and Richard C. Hoagland. Stine would also occasionally advise Rick Sternbach and Mike Okuda in their work for \"\" as technical artists and advisors, and was credited in \"\" for that assistance. The character named \"Harry Stein\" in the novel Stardance (by Spider Robinson and Jeanne Robinson) is a homage to Stine.\n\nStine was very interested in the interaction of volunteer/free market Libertarian ideas with space colonization and as a tool of citizen diplomacy and world peace, and so was called to serve as Chair of the Advisory Board of the Libertarian International Organization where he mentored various citizen initiatives until his death. In the wake of his book, \"The Third Industrial Revolution,\" he was asked to co-organize the American Astronautical Society 1977 conference on private Space Colonization to re-channel focus away from Space exploration alone, and where he received an award as a Founder of the international space effort. He was interested in the concept of non immediate profit-driven free markets, and was seen as a developer and defender of the \"pay it forward\" approach with Robert A. Heinlein, a term also popularized in a movie of that name, starring Kevin Spacey and other stars. In addition to \"The Third Industrial Revolution\", he wrote several other books encouraging public awareness of the possibilities of a lucrative and socially beneficial active space industry.\n\nStine was a founding member of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy, and attended several meetings including the 1980 meeting that prepared the space defense policy papers for the Reagan Transition Team. The Council was instrumental in developing the Reagan Strategic Defense Initiative which became known as Star Wars.\n\nAdditional speculative works later in his life included \"Warbots\", a fictional concept based on a melded human/robotic military force that utilized a mixed combination of AI-driven robotic military units with on-site human commanders and enlisted personnel to assess the situation and adjust goals and activities to match the conditions of action in the face of inevitable changes, focusing on the power and dispensability of AI-driven machines with the flexibility and adaptability of the human mind and body.\n\nHe died on November 2, 1997, in Phoenix, Arizona, of an apparent stroke.\n\n\"Starship Through Space\", Henry Holt, 1954\n\"Rocket Man\", Henry Holt, 1955\n\n\"Contraband Rocket\", Ace Double, 1955 \n\"Star Driver\", Del Rey, July 1980\n\"Shuttle Down\", Del Rey, April 1981\n\"Space Doctor\", Del Rey, June 1981\n\"The Abode of Life\", Pocket Science Fiction, May 1982\n\"Manna\", DAW Science Fiction, January 1984\n\"A Matter of Metalaw\", DAW Science Fiction, October 1986\n\n\"Warbots\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, May 1988 \n\"Warbots #2: Operation Steel Band\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, July 1988 \n\"Warbots #3: The Bastaard Rebellion\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, September 1988 \n\"Warbots #4: Sierra Madre\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, November 1988 \n\"Warbots #5: Operation High Dragon\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, January 1989 \n\"Warbots #6: The Lost Battalion\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, April 1989 \n\"Warbots #7: Operation Iron Fist\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, August 1990 \n\"Warbots #8: Force of Arms\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, March 1990 \n\"Warbots #9: Blood Siege\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, September 1990 \n\"Warbots #10: Guts and Glory\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, June 1991 \n\"Warbots #11: Warrior Shield\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, February 1992 \n\"Warbots #12: Judgement Day\", Pinnacle Science Fiction, September 1992 \n\"Starsea Invaders: First Action\", New American Library, August 1993\n\"Starsea Invaders: Second Contact\", New American Library, March 1994\n\"Starsea Invaders: Third Encounter\", New American Library, May 1995\n\"Open Space\" (graphic novel, undated)\n\n\"Earth Satellites and the Race for Space Superiority\", 1957\n\"Rocket Power and Space Flight\", Henry Holt & Co., 1957\n\"Man and the Space Frontier\", 1962\n\"The Third Industrial Revolution\", Putnam, 1975 \n\"Shuttle into Space: A Ride in America's Space Transportation\", 1978\n\"The Third Industrial Revolution\", Ace Science Fiction, May 1979 \n\"The Space Enterprise\", Ace Science, August 1980 \n\"Confrontation in Space\", Prentice-Hall, 1981\n\"Space Power\", Ace Science, September 1981 \n\"The Space Enterprise\", 1982\n\"The Hopeful Future\", MacMillan, 1983 \n\"The Silicon Gods\", Dell, October , 1984\n\"The Untold Story of The Computer Revolution\", Arbor House, 1984 \n\"Frontiers of Science: Strange Machines You Can Build\", Atheneum, 1985 \n\"Handbook for Space Colonists\", Henry Holt & Co., 1985 \n\"On The Frontiers of Science\", Atheneum, 1985 \n\"The Corporate Survivors\", Amacom Books, 1986 \n\"ICBM: The Making of the Weapon That Changed the World\", Crown, 1991 \n\"Mind Machines You Can Build\", Top Of The Mountain Publishing, 1992 \n\"Halfway to Anywhere\", M.

The highest public institution was the Seonggyungwan, located in Seoul. Below this were the \"Sahak\" (사부학당), four schools providing technical training, and the \"hyanggyo\", schools supported by each of the Eight Provinces. The \"hyanggyo\" soon fell into neglect, and for most of the Joseon period education was dominated by two types of private schools, \"seowon\" (preparatory schools mostly for the aristocracy) and \"seodang\" (private village schools providing elementary education).\n\nThe civil service examinations, known as \"gwageo\", assessed subject's ability to interpret the Chinese classics, in terms of official Neo-Confucian ideology. The gwageo were divided into civil and military sections.

{"id": "1837181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837181", "title": "Heysham Port railway station", "text": "Heysham Port railway station\n\nHeysham Port railway station serves the port of Heysham in Lancashire, England. It is the terminus of the Morecambe Branch Line from Lancaster and is situated south of .\n\nHeysham Harbour station (hence its current station code) was opened by the Midland Railway on 11 July 1904. It was relocated to an adjacent site on 4 May 1970, and served boat trains for Belfast until the closure of the ferry route in April 1975. The train service was withdrawn on 6 October, but reinstated and the station renamed Heysham Sea Terminal, on 11 May 1987 to provide a rail connection with the daily sailing to Douglas run by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The station acquired its present name on 28 September 1992. This was under the Regional Railways sector of British Rail.\n\nAs constructed, the station had three platforms, two signal boxes and an extensive goods depot and associated sidings to service the port complex (which dates from 1904). It handled a range of freight for export including livestock, parcels and fuel oil from a distribution terminal operated by Shell. None of these types of traffic have been handled here since the early 1980s - all freight through the port, mainly containers, is worked by road.\n\nA frequent passenger service was provided by the Midland Railway for its work force at the port and the regular ferry sailings to Scotland, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland. Four years after opening, the MR used the line as a test track for a pioneering system of electrification, utilising a trio of purpose-built 3-car Electric Multiple Units powered by an overhead catenary carrying alternating current at 6600V, 25 Hz. Stock for the line was built at the company's works and power was provided from their power plant at the harbour. Services ran to Morecambe on 13 April 1908 and by September extended to the LNWR main line station at . With two reversals required en route and a relatively short journey between termini, the units were well suited for the busy route, which operated on a half-hourly frequency for much of the day. Long distance express trains routed by way of the former \"Little\" North Western Railway main line from via also used the station. The most notable was a daily through train to/from London St Pancras via connecting with the ferry to Belfast. After the 1923 Grouping, the station and port came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The company developed traffic but made alterations to the passenger services, replacing the St Pancras service with one from London Euston via and the West Coast Main Line and added a second regular boat service to and from Manchester Victoria. Services ran to and from Leeds and through carriages were provided for St Pancras passengers in summer until the onset of World War II.\n\nNationalisation in January 1948 saw the London Midland Region of British Railways take over the running of the line. British Railways withdrew the old Midland EMUs in 1951 and, two years later, replaced them with three elderly ex-LNWR sets formerly used on the West London Line service between Earls Court and Willesden Junction (a fourth set was added in 1957). The power feed was adjusted to use an alternating frequency of 50 Hz rather than 25 Hz. The units remained in use until after the Beeching Report in 1963, which recommended that services over the former NWR/Midland route from Lancaster be withdrawn and the line closed. Services to Morecambe would be retained, but only in connection with sailings to Douglas and Belfast and were to be diesel-worked.\n\nThe proposals were approved in August 1965, and the local service was withdrawn on 3 January 1966. The overheads were dismantled the following year, after the Midland line was closed to all traffic between Morecambe, Lancaster and . Freight traffic continued although from June 1967, it operated via Morecambe, where all trains had to reverse.\n\nA further change to traffic patterns came about in 1968, when ferry operator Sealink announced its intention to convert the two ships operating out of the port on the Belfast route to \"roll-on/roll-off\" car ferries rather than conventional passenger ships. The change required major alterations to the ferries and to the berths at both termini. At Heysham, the station building was demolished and its replacement built on an adjacent site. The station reopened for traffic on 4 May 1970. As part of the scheme, a new signal box and associated signalling was provided. The viability of the Belfast route was compromised by the Northern Irish Troubles in the years that followed. Mounting losses led to its withdrawal on 5 April 1975 and led the connecting rail services becoming redundant and to the closure of the station to passengers, a few months later.\n\nFreight traffic continued but was only a fraction of what had been handled previously and BR rationalised the station layout, mothballing the signal box, removing the signalling and disconnecting one of the two approach lines from Heysham Moss in 1977. The remaining line was operated under \"One Train Working\" regulations, with the box acting as a ground frame for controlling the points to the sidings. The disused station had two platform lines accessible for use by railtours and special trains. By 1983, oil trains had ceased and the terminal sidings were then lifted.\n\nPassenger trains resumed in 1987, and in 1994, the layout was rationalised again as part of the programme of works associated with the building of the current Morecambe station. The last portion of double track on the branch from Holt Bank Junction to the former ICI sidings at Heysham Moss was singled, redundant trackwork was removed, and the old signal box dismantled (it was subsequently donated to the heritage Dean Forest Railway and has been restored and rebuilt at ). After the work was completed, all that remained was the single line from Morecambe running into the one active platform and a private siding connection laid in the early 1970s into Heysham power station. Much of the land occupied by the old goods yard and disused platforms is used by the Port of Heysham's owners, Peel Ports as secure parking for HGVs waiting for ferries.\n\nThe branch handles occasional freight trains operated by Direct Rail Services from the reprocessing plant at Sellafield to Heysham nuclear power station. They usually run once or twice-weekly and use the siding that diverges from the main running line a short distance east of the station. Access is by means of a ground frame unlocked and operated by the train crew and the trains are usually worked with a locomotive at each end to avoid the need for run-round moves when it reverses at Morecambe.\n\nThe facilities at the station are basic: it is unstaffed and a single waiting shelter is provided. All tickets must be purchased in advance or on board the train. There is step-free access from the ferry terminal and car park to the platform.\n\nAlthough the station is publicly accessible, it can be reached only by travelling along the busy main road into the port complex (either by car or on foot) from Heysham village, which is more than 1 mi (1.6 km) away. Most passengers using the station do so only to connect with the daily ferry sailings as there is no local commuter or residential traffic.\n\nA twice-daily service formerly served the railway station (the first around midday with a second approximately an hour later), which connected with the ferry to Douglas in the Isle of Man. The services were operated by Northern as an extension of the Lancaster-Morecambe shuttle, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, one train ran through to/from Manchester Victoria via . A Sunday service ran during the summer months. From December 2008 the service was reduced to one train each way per day, which ran to and from . A Sunday service (of two trains each way) operated in the summer months (mid-May until mid-September).\n\nFrom the summer 2018 timetable change the service has been altered again, now running to and from Lancaster only. The Sunday service has been reduced to a single train each way, but runs throughout the year.\n\n\n\n"}

Her other film roles include \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" (1982), \"Lost in America\" (1985), \"What About Bob?\" (1991), \"Freddy Got Fingered\" (2001), \"A Master Builder\" (2014), and \"Marriage Story\" (2019).\n\nHagerty was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of Harriet Yuellig (née Bishop), a model and singer, and Jerald William \"Jerry\" Hagerty, Jr., a musician. Her brother Michael Hagerty was also an actor. Her parents later divorced. Hagerty attended Indian Hill High School. She was signed as a model for Ford Models at 15, and spent summers modeling in New York City. She moved there in 1972 and worked at her brother's theater group; she also studied with actor William Hickey.\n\nHagerty made her off-Broadway debut in 1979, starring in \"Mutual Benefit Life\" at her brother's theater, The Production Company. In 1983 she appeared Off-Broadway at the Vandam Theatre in Shel Silverstein's 'Wild Life' directed by Art Wolff. It was an ensemble theatre piece co-starring Christopher Murney, W.H. Macy, Henderson Forsythe, Conard Fowkes, Jody Gelb, Howard Lee Sherman and Raynor Scheine. She continued appearing on stage, including starring in a Broadway version of \"The House of Blue Leaves\". Her first film role was in \"All That Jazz\", but her small part was cut out of the finished film. She was subsequently cast opposite Robert Hays in the parody film, \"Airplane!\" It was released in June 1980 and became the third-highest grossing comedy in box office history at that time, behind \"Smokey and the Bandit\" (1977) and \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" (1978). \"Airplane!\" established Hagerty as a noted comedic actress.\n\nHagerty spent the 1980s starring in a number of theatrical films, ranging from the well-reviewed Albert Brooks film \"Lost In America\" and Woody Allen's \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" to the badly received \"Beyond Therapy\". Her roles often involved a naive or spaced-out character who seems to be unaware of whatever chaos was surrounding her, as exemplified in \"Airplane!\" and \"Airplane II: The Sequel\". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Hagerty mostly appeared in made-for-television movies or supporting roles in Hollywood films, including the '90s comedies \"What About Bob?\" and \"Noises Off\", as well as a part in the 2005 film \"Just Friends\" and 2006's \"She's the Man\".\n\nIn 1991, she starred alongside Fran Drescher and Twiggy in \"Princesses\", a sitcom that aired for five weeks on CBS. Hagerty had walked off set after four episodes amid poor ratings and negative reviews. She was cast in the 1994 \"Designing Women\" spin-off \"Women of the House\", but was committed to another project when filming began, so Valerie Mahaffey substituted for her in several episodes. She eventually joined the cast, filmed two episodes, and resigned, handing the role back to Mahaffey, who bowed out after one final appearance. In 1998, she starred in the short-lived UPN sitcom \"Reunited\".\n\nIn 2000, she narrated the audiobook version of \"The Trolls,\" a children's novel by Polly Horvath.

Capel has a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Daily temperatures range from 13 °C to 40 °C in summer, and from 5 °C to 27 °C in winter. Average annual rainfall is about 830 mm.\n\nHistorically, Capel is a farming area; traditional agricultural pursuits include dairy and beef. In recent times, Capel has become popular for hobby farms, and a number of innovative agricultural pursuits have been introduced, including alpacas, viticulture, aquaculture and growing of blue gums. There is also some mining of mineral sands in the Shire, and tourism is increasingly important to the Shire's economy.\n\nThe Capel area was originally inhabited by the Noongar Aboriginals. It was settled very early in the history of colonial Western Australia. The Capel River was visited by Frederick Ludlow in 1834, but it was not given an English name until the Bussell family settled in the area. The name honours Capel Carter Brockman (1839–1924), daughter of John Bussell (1803–1875), who was named after a Miss Capel Carter, a cousin of the Bussells in England with whom Bussell family members corresponded. In the 1830s a number of settlers followed the Bussells into the area, and both James Stirling and John Hutt, (the first two Governors of Western Australia) took up land in the region. Plans to establish a townsite in the area were first mooted in 1844, but the site was not surveyed until the 1870s and lots were not sold until 1897. Initially the town was named Coolingnup, which is the Noongar name for the place; the name was changed to Capel in 1899.\n\nThe population of the town was 91 (44 males and 47 females) in 1898. According to the 2016 census figures, the population of the Town of Capel was 2,509, and the population of the Shire of Capel was 17,123.\n\nWestralian Sands was established in 1954 but commenced operations in 1959 when it started mining and processing the Yoganup deposit just north of the town. Another company, RGC, operated a mine to the south of the town. In 1998 both companies merged to form Iluka Resources which continues to operate ilmenite mines around the area and produce synthetic rutile at the processing facility to the north of the town along the Bussell Highway.\n\nThe climate is hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: \"Csa\"), at a certain distance from the headquarters, Forrest Beach has the warm-summer version as in Busselton or southern California (\"Csb\"), delimiting the northern limit of the second climatic zone on the Australian coast.\n\n"}
{"id": "1837196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837196", "title": "Aspull", "text": "Aspull\n\nAspull is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, in Greater Manchester, England. Historically in Lancashire, Aspull, along with Haigh, is surrounded by greenbelt and agricultural land, separated from Westhoughton, on its southeast side, by a brook running through Borsdane Wood. The ground rises from south to north, reaching , and has views towards Winter Hill and the West Pennine Moors. It has a population of 4,977.\n\nAspull was once a centre of mining and textile manufacture, though little evidence of this can be seen in the village today. Haigh Country Park estate lies to the west.\n\nThe earliest notice of Aspull is that contained in the survey of 1212, when, as one plough-land, it formed part of the Childwall fee held by Richard son of Robert de Lathom, under the lord of Manchester. The fee was a composite one of 6½ plough-lands (of which Aspull formed one), held chiefly by Richard de Lathom, and partly by Roger de Samlesbury and Alexander de Harwood.\n\nIn 1302 Richard de Ince, as son and heir of Henry de Sefton, and Adam de Hindley, were found to hold Aspull, as the eighth part of a knight's fee, directly of Thomas Grelley. From this time the lordship has been held with the adjacent Ince by the families of Ince and Gerard in succession; until Aspull was sold to the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, lord of Haigh.\n\nHindley Hall, in Aspull, the residence of the Hindleys, became the property of James, a younger son of Robert Dukinfield of Cheshire. In the 18th century it was acquired by the Leighs of Whitley Hall, Wigan, and Sir Robert Holt Leigh lived here till his death in 1843. His estates then passed for life to his cousin Thomas Pemberton, who took the name of Leigh, and made Hindley Hall his residence; he was raised to the peerage as Baron Kingsdown in 1858.\n\nThe hearth tax roll of 1666 shows that 135 hearths were charged. The most considerable houses were those of Richard Green, nine hearths; Peter Orrell and James Dukinfield, eight each; Major Rigby and Thomas Molyneux, seven each; and Edward Gleast, six.\n\nSt. Elizabeth's C of E Church was built in 1882 by Roger Leigh. The patronage is vested in trustees. There are two Methodist chapels. In 1858 the Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was erected.\n\nCannel coal was found in Aspull. There were several large collieries dating back to the 18th century, also malt kilns and a cotton mill. In 1896 the Crawford, Kirkless, Moor and Woodshaw Pits in the township belonging the Wigan Coal and Iron Company employed over 1,000 workers. Aspull's long history of mining left a legacy of old mineshafts, water drainage tunnels (soughs) and abandoned mine workings.\n\nThe Great Haigh Sough in Haigh Country Park discharged iron rich minewater into the Yellow Brook\ndiscolouring the brook and River Douglas downstream with ochre deposits. In 2004 the Coal Authority provided a passive treatment plant in a scheme costing £750,000. Work was undertaken by Ascot Environmental who built a pumping station, pipelines, settlement lagoons, reedbeds and landscaped the site. The scheme has improved the water quality removing the discolouration and allowed fish to populate the brook.\n\nThe coal-mining tradition lives on in the name of the \"Collier's Arms\" pub on Wigan Road, which has a date plaque of 1700 .\n\nAspull is on a crossroads. The principal road is to the north-east/south-west, Blackrod to Wigan. Another road runs north-west/south-east, Standish to the A6 road. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through the western corner of the township. Aspull Moor lies in the northern half of the village.\n\nThe nearest railway station is at Hindley although Blackrod is only a few yards further distant. Hindley has the more frequent service, whilst Blackrod has the faster service to Manchester. Whilst having colliery (goods) railways Aspull has never had a central railway station of its own. There was, however, on the line from Wigan to Chorley (via Hindley), a station named \" Dicconson Lane & Aspull\" some distance from Aspull; that was closed in 1956, before closure of the entire line to passengers in 1960 and to goods in 1966.\n\nThe town's rugby union club, Aspull RFC, currently plays in the Raging Bull North West League Division 3 North, and also fields a veterans team. The club also a successful junior setup currently consisting of U11s-U14s. The rugby club is based at Woodshaw Park at the base of the Aspull landmark the \"Woochie\" where they have full training facilities function rooms and a bar. The club logo is that of an emu. This is due to regular sightings of the second-largest living bird on the nearby spoil heap the 'Woochie'. The club has had a great deal of success over the years winning both the Lancashire Cup and Lancashire Plate along with numerous promotions and relegations.\n\n\nBibliography\n'Townships: Aspull', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 118–22.\n\n"}

{"id": "1837213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837213", "title": "Feast of the Transfiguration", "text": "Feast of the Transfiguration\n\nThe Feast of the Transfiguration is celebrated by various Christian communities in honor of the transfiguration of Jesus. The origins of the feast are less than certain and may have derived from the dedication of three basilicas on Mount Tabor. The feast was present in various forms by the 9th century, and in the Western Church was made a universal feast on 6 August by Pope Callixtus III to commemorate the raising of the Siege of Belgrade (1456).\n\nIn the Syriac Orthodox, Indian Orthodox, Revised Julian calendars within Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholic, Old Catholic, and Anglican churches, the Feast of the Transfiguration is observed on 6 August. In some Lutheran traditions preceding the reforms to the liturgy in the 1970s, the 6th of August was also observed as the Feast of the Transfiguration. In those Orthodox churches which continue to follow the Julian Calendar, August 6 falls on August 19 of the Gregorian Calendar. The Transfiguration is considered a major feast, numbered among the twelve Great Feasts in Byzantine Catholicism and Orthodoxy. In all these churches, if the feast falls on a Sunday, its liturgy is not combined with the Sunday liturgy, but completely replaces it.\n\nIn the Revised Common Lectionary, followed by Lutherans, United Methodists, Episcopalians, and others, the last Sunday in the Epiphany season (that immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) is also devoted to this event. In the Church of Sweden and the Church of Finland, however, the Feast is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, the eighth Sunday after Pentecost.\n\nIn the Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Transfiguration falls during the Dormition Fast, but in recognition of the feast the fast is relaxed somewhat and the consumption of fish, wine and oil is allowed on this day.\n\nIn the Byzantine view the Transfiguration is not only a feast in honor of Jesus, but a feast of the Holy Trinity, for all three Persons of the Trinity are interpreted as being present at that moment: God the Father spoke from heaven; God the Son was the one being transfigured, and God the Holy Spirit was present in the form of a cloud. In this sense, the transfiguration is also considered the \"Small Epiphany\" (the \"Great Epiphany\" being the Baptism of Jesus, when the Holy Trinity appeared in a similar pattern).\n\nThe Transfiguration is ranked as one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the Byzantine liturgical calendar, and is celebrated with an All-Night Vigil beginning on the eve of the Feast.\n\nGrapes are traditionally brought to church to be blessed after the Divine Liturgy on the day of the Transfiguration. If grapes are not available in the area, apples or some other fruit may be brought. This begins the \"Blessing of First Fruits\" for the year.\n\nThe Transfiguration is the second of the \"Three Feasts of the Saviour in August\", the other two being the Procession of the Cross on August 1 and the Icon of Christ Not Made by Hand on August 16. The Transfiguration is preceded by a one-day Forefeast and is followed by an Afterfeast of eight days, ending the day before the Forefeast of the Dormition.\n\nIn Byzantine theology, the Tabor Light is the light revealed on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration of Jesus, identified with the light seen by Paul on the road to Damascus.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church Celebrates the feast of transfiguration on 19 August, which falls as the 13th of Mesri in the Coptic calendar. The feast is considered one of the seven minor feasts of the church, and is celebrated in the joyful tune.\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Church holds the ceremony of Buhe on the Feast of the Transfiguration.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, the Transfiguration was once celebrated locally in various parts of the Catholic world on different days, including August 6, but was not universally recognized. In 1456, the Kingdom of Hungary repulsed an Ottoman invasion of the Balkans by breaking the Siege of Belgrade. News of the victory arrived in Rome on August 6. Given the importance to international politics at that time of such battles between Christian and Muslim nations, in celebration of the victory Pope Callixtus III elevated the Transfiguration to a Feast day to be celebrated in the entire Roman rite.\n\nIn 2002, Pope John Paul II selected the Transfiguration as one of the five Luminous Mysteries of the rosary.\n\nThe Old Catholic Church celebrates the Transfiguration typically on August 6, according to the Roman rite calendar; however, every local Old Catholic Church throughout the world has the option to celebrate this major feast on a different day. The Old Catholic theological view of the Transfiguration shares much in common with the Eastern Orthodox perspective. Old Catholics also believe that the transfiguration was a major event that revealed the divinity of Christ; that Jesus is indeed the splendor and \"eikon\" of the Father. The Transfiguration shows forth humanity in the splendor of its original form when it was united in the life-giving love of the Triune God. This event reveals the possibility of humanity's theosis.\n\nIf the Transfiguration falls on a Sunday, it replaces the ordinary liturgical Ordo of the season for Sacred Liturgy.\n\nAfter the Reformation the Feast of the Transfiguration was abandoned in the Protestant parts of Germany, but continued to be observed in Sweden.\n\nThe Feast of the Transfiguration is retained in the Common Worship lectionary of the Church of England (6 August). In the Book of Common Prayer (1549 and 1552) the feast of the Transfiguration, which had had a relatively low rank in the Sarum Calendar is omitted, but was restored to the Calendar, but without a collect and reading being provided, by royal order in 1560. This state of affairs is perpetuated in the 1662 Prayer Book, but this would have been remedied had the 1928 Proposed BCP been approved by Parliament. As it was, the Bishops of the Church of England refused to sanction those who used the abortive 1928 Book of Common Prayer, and the August 6th date came into general use. The American Book of Common Prayer of 1892 introduced it to Episcopal use, and from there it has been taken into most modern Anglican calendars (sometimes called \"The Transfiguration of Our Lord\").\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the North American Lutheran Church (NALC) observe the Feast of the Transfiguration as the last Sunday after the Epiphany, which is the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday and the season of Lent.\n\nIn the Presbyterian Church, the Sunday of the Transfiguration marks the last day of the Epiphany season, on the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday. The inceptive Calvinist tradition rejected all liturgical feasts, including the Feast of the Transfiguration. This, however, does not mean that the Transfiguration itself was ignored by the Calvinists. Calvin's own views on the Transfiguration were far from ambivalent:\n\nWith time, most major feasts were restored to the Reformed ecclesiastical calendar. The Sunday of Transfiguration is now a part of the Revised Common Lectionary. Whether it is celebrated liturgically or in name only, it is left to the discretion of the clergy or Session.\n\nThe Book of Common Worship of 1993 (Presbyterian Church USA) contains the order of the service for Transfiguration of the Lord. This order is either combined with the Sunday liturgy or replaces it in those congregations which orient themselves towards liturgical practices and observances.\n\n"}

It is located on the Morecambe Branch Line from to Heysham. The current truncated two-platform station was opened in 1994 to replace the Midland Railway's earlier terminus situated some further west, closer to the town's sea front. The old station building remains in use as a pub and restaurant, but its platforms have been demolished and the site is now occupied by a cinema and the Morecambe indoor market. That station was itself a replacement for the North Western Railway's original two-platform terminus at Northumberland Street (opened in 1851 and closed in March 1907), which was located almost exactly on the same site as the current station and ticket office.\n\nRecently a modern ticket office was opened and passenger numbers have increased by 8% over the last five years. Services are operated by variety of diesel multiple units, including Class 144, Class 150, Class 156 and Class 158 sets.\n\nTerminating passenger services usually run into Platform 1. However, trains to/from Heysham must use the Platform 2 line in order to reverse and gain access to the single track Heysham branch. The lines to Platforms 1 and 2 connect 1.6 miles away at a junction east of station. Heysham services (currently one return trip per day Mon-Sat and two on summer Sundays) access the Heysham section by means of a ground frame at the junction which is released by Preston signalling centre (which has supervised the branch since the closure of Bare Lane signal box in December 2012) and operated by the train crew.\n\nThe ticket office is staffed from the early morning until mid-afternoon, six days per week (closed Sundays). Passengers can purchase tickets (or a permit to travel) from a ticket vending machine at the station at other times. A waiting shelter is provided, along with a P.A system and digital information screens. There is step-free access to the platform from the station entrance and ticket office.\n\nThe station is served by Northern local services, which operate as a regular Lancaster-Morecambe shuttle. There are also five daily longer-distance services from Morecambe to and via the Leeds to Morecambe Line and one late evening through train to . \n\nAdditionally, there is a limited service (one each way all week) to Heysham, connecting with the ferry to the Isle of Man. Trains for Heysham must reverse at Morecambe.\n\nThe token direct trains to Canforth that ran up until the summer 2019 timetable change (one early a.m Lancaster - Morecambe - train, plus one weekday and three Sunday services to Leeds) have now been withdrawn. The Parliamentary train legal minimum service for the Bare Lane to Hest Bank North Junction chord is now provided by an early morning train from Lancaster which runs via Carnforth (reverse) and the curve in question.\n\nNorthern's franchise agreement (started on 1 April 2016) includes provision for additional trains on the Leeds route - three additional weekday services were introduced from May 2018 (with trains timed to improve commuting & leisure opportunities at either end of the route) and one additional train each way on Sundays (the additional trains however start/terminate at Lancaster). Pacer DMUs are planned to disappear from the route (and all other services in Northern England) by December 2019.\n\n"}
