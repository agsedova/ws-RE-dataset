It is defined as the irreversible loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Dental erosion is the most common chronic disease of children ages 5–17, although it is only relatively recently that it has been recognised as a dental health problem. There is generally widespread ignorance of the damaging effects of acid erosion; this is particularly the case with erosion due to fruit juices, because they tend to be seen as healthy. Acid erosion begins initially in the enamel, causing it to become thin, and can progress into dentin, giving the tooth a dull yellow appearance and leading to dentin hypersensitivity.\n\nThe most common cause of erosion is by acidic foods and drinks. In general, foods and drinks with a pH below 5.0–5.7 have been known to trigger dental erosion effects. Numerous clinical and laboratory reports link erosion to excessive consumption of drinks. Those thought to pose a risk are soft drinks, some alcohol and fruit drinks, fruit juices such as orange juice (which contain citric acid) and carbonated drinks such as colas (in which the carbonic acid is not the cause of erosion, but citric and phosphoric acid). Additionally, wine has been shown to erode teeth, with the pH of wine as low as 3.0–3.8. Other possible sources of erosive acids are from exposure to chlorinated swimming pool water, and regurgitation of gastric acids. In children with chronic diseases, the use of medicines with acid components is a risk factor too. Dental erosion has also been recorded in the fossil record and was likely caused by the consumption of acidic fruits or plants.\n\nExtrinsic acid erosion is when the source of acid originates from outside of the body. Acidic food and drink lowers the pH level of the mouth resulting in demineralisation of the teeth. A variety of drinks contribute to dental erosion due to their low pH level. Examples include fruit juices, such as apple and orange juices, sports drinks, wine and beer. Carbonated drinks, such as colas and lemonades, are also very acidic and hence have significant erosive potential. Foods such as fresh fruits, ketchup and pickled food in vinegar have been implicated in causing acid erosion. Frequency rather than total intake of acidic juices is seen as the greater factor in dental erosion; infants using feeding bottles containing fruit juices (especially when used as a comforter) are therefore at greater risk of acid erosion.\n\nSaliva acts as a buffer, regulating the pH when acidic drinks are ingested. Drinks vary in their resistance to the buffering effect of saliva. Studies show that fruit juices are the most resistant to saliva's buffering effect, followed by, in order: fruit-based carbonated drinks and flavoured mineral waters, non-fruit-based carbonated drinks, sparkling mineral waters; Mineral water being the least resistant. Because of this, fruit juices in particular, may prolong the drop in pH levels.\n\nA number of medications such as chewable vitamin C, aspirin and some iron preparations are acidic and may contribute towards acid erosion. Certain drugs can cause hypo-salivation which is considered a risk factor for acid erosion.\n\nIntrinsic dental erosion, also known as perimolysis, is the process whereby gastric acid from the stomach comes into contact with the teeth. This is often secondary to conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and rumination syndrome. Dental erosion can also occur by non-extrinsic factors. There is evidence linking eating disorders with a range of oral health problems including dental erosion, caries and xerostomia. Reduced salivary flow rate, a common symptom of bulimia, predisposes an individual to dental erosion due to increased vulnerability to the effects of acidic food and drinks. Self-induced vomiting increases the risk of dental erosion by a factor of 5.5 compared to healthy controls. Lesions are most commonly found on the palatal surfaces of the teeth, followed by the occlusal and then the buccal surfaces. The main cause of GERD is increased acid production by the stomach. This is not exclusive to adults, as GERD and other gastrointestinal disorders may cause dental erosions in children.\n\nAcid erosion often coexists with abrasion and attrition. Abrasion is most often caused by brushing teeth too hard.\nAny frothing or swishing acidic drinks around the mouth before swallowing increases the risk of widespread acid erosion. Sucking citrus fruits can also contribute to acid erosion.\n\nIn-vivo studies are advantageous in assessing erosion directly from the patient's mouth. There are numerous signs of dental erosion, including changes in appearance and sensitivity.\n\nOne of the physical changes can be the color of teeth. Dental erosion can lead to two major tooth colour change - the first being a change of color that usually happens on the cutting edge of the central incisors. This causes the cutting edge of the tooth to become transparent. A second sign is a yellowish tint on the eroded tooth. This occurs because the white enamel has eroded away to reveal the yellowish dentin beneath. On top of clinical examination, the dentist may take intra-oral photographs to monitor the extent and progress of erosion. Clinical photographs lead to comparable results to a visual examination, however both may result in an underestimation of the extent of tooth wear.\n\nA change in shape of the teeth is also a sign of dental erosion. Teeth will begin to appear with a broad rounded concavity, and the gaps between teeth will become larger. There can be evidence of wear on surfaces of teeth not expected to be in contact with one another. If dental erosion occurs in children, a loss of enamel surface characteristics can occur. Amalgam restorations in the mouth may be clean and non-tarnished. As tooth substance around restorations erodes away, fillings may also appear to be rising out of the tooth. The teeth may form divots on the chewing surfaces when dental erosion is occurring. This mainly happens on the first, second, and third molars. To monitor the change in shape over time, dentists can create and retain accurate, serial study casts. Dentists may also employ dental indices to guide their diagnosis and management of the condition. A new scoring system referred to as Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) grades the appearance or severity of wear on the teeth by the extent of hard tissue loss. It is noted that indices are useful in monitoring the most severe clinical changes in tooth wear. However, they lack comprehensiveness as they cannot measure the rate of progression and cannot monitor all teeth affected by erosion. There is also a lack of an index which is universally accepted and standardised.\n\nOne of the most severe signs of dental erosion is cracking, where teeth begin to crack off and become coarse. Other signs include pain when eating hot, cold, or sweet foods. This pain is due to the enamel having been eroded away, exposing the sensitive dentin.\n\nBased on the optical changes induced in eroded tissue by the lesions, in 2015 Koshoji \"et al.\" also demonstrated in a novel method that using laser speckle images (LSI) it is possible to acquire information on the microstructure of the enamel and detect minimal changes, such as early non-carious lesions. To produce the erosion, the samples were divided into four groups and immersed in 30 mL of a cola-based beverage (pH approximately 2.5) at room temperature. A representative image of the samples under white and laser illumination shows that although there are visible stains in the left portion of each sample due the dye from the cola beverage, structural changes are difficult to assess with the naked eye.\n\nTo differentiate the sound and eroded tissues, contrast analysis was performed of the speckle patterns in the images. Since this analysis is, in its essence, the ratio of the standard deviation and average intensity, the LASCA map of the lesion is generally higher than in sound tissue. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the LASCA maps which show the greater prevalence of dark blue on the right side, indicating sound tissue, and lower prevalence on the left side, indicating eroded tissue. The contrast ratio of the LASCA maps demonstrates that laser speckle images are sensitive to even small changes in the microstructure of the surface.\n\nErosion is highly prevalent in people of all ages. However, an objective diagnostic procedure is still needed, thus the study of the laser speckle imaging for tooth enamel may provide the first low cost objective diagnostic method for this disease. The analysis of laser speckle imaging in the spatial domain is a powerful diagnostic technique that provides information on the surface microstructure of tooth enamel after an acid etching procedure using patterns and LASCA maps. In an erosion model, these patterns are associated with mineral loss from the enamel. This method has proven sensitive to 10 minutes of acid etching on tooth enamel, which is a lesion so incipient that is not likely to be detected in clinical practice even by a trained dentist, besides it is also sensitive to the erosion progression.\n\nThe causes of dental erosion are classified into two main categories – intrinsic and extrinsic. The former is due to regurgitated gastric acid from the stomach while the latter is from dietary, medicinal, occupational & recreational origins. It is important to recognise it early, detect its cause and provide relevant advice or treatment to stop its progression. Strategies for prevention and management consist of the following:\n\nWhere intrinsic sources of acid have been identified:\n\nA: What can the individual do?\n\n1. Consult a medical doctor immediately if you notice or are aware of any signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), such as acid reflux and heartburn, or if you suffer from an eating disorder or chronic alcoholism. They can confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan accordingly.\n\n2. Be cautious when purchasing the following items: vitamin C, iron-tonic and amino-acid tablets, aspirin, hydrogen chloride based preparations, asthma medications, mouthrinses with low pH, paediatric syrup medication, acidic salivary substitutes and bleaching agents. They can potentially lead to erosion.\n\nB: Dental professionals’ led prevention and treatment\n\n3. Prescribe or administer a neutralising agent, such as antacid tablets in suspension. Antacids helps neutralise stomach acidity and inhibit proteolytic activity of pepsin, both of which provide relief to symptoms of GERD such as heartburn. Note that antacids may interfere with other medications and are not suitable for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, those that suffer from liver disease, kidney disease or heart failure and an illness associated with sodium control, such as high blood pressure or cirrhosis.\n\n4. Encourage patients to maintain their body mass index (BMI) within normal range or by making healthy lifestyle changes in relation to diet and exercise. Obesity is said to be an important risk factor in the development and deterioration of GERD.\n\n5. Find out if the patient has any underlying medical conditions or did consider a change of medications that induce hyposalivation and vomiting. If the patient displays severe signs or symptoms, referral to a medical doctor is necessary. Refer patients to a dietician for them to receive personalised dietary counselling if signs and symptoms still persist.\n\n6. Request that patients complete the SCOFF questionnaire, a valid and reliable screening tool for early detection and treatment of suspected eating disorders. A response of ‘yes’ receives 1 point. An accumulative score of > 2 indicates the likelihood of anorexia or bulimia. The acronym SCOFF dictates the following questions:\n\n● Do you make yourself SICK because you feel uncomfortably full?\n\n● Do you worry you have lost CONTROL over how much you eat?\n\n● Have you recently lost more than ONE stone in a 3 month period?\n\n● Do you believe yourself to be FAT when others say you are too thin?\n\n● Would you say that FOOD dominates your life?\n\nC: Industry led measures\n\n7. Develop effective over-the-counter medications for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that minimise side effects of those presently available. For instance, some side effects antacids, H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have in common are constipation, diarrhea and nausea.\nWhere Extrinsic sources of acids have been identified\n\nA: What can the individual do?\n\n8. Reduce the frequency of acidic food intake which includes fizzy drinks and fruit juices that contain phosphoric or citric acid. Tooth enamel and dentine are both made up of calcium deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite. Acid and/or chelators present in the food we consume penetrate through the plague, the pellicle and the protein/ lipid coating into the individual crystals. Hydrogen ions combine with carbonate and/ or phosphate, releasing all ions in the affected region, giving rise to direct surface etching/ erosion. Reducing the frequency of intake, minimises the duration to which enamel is exposed to acids, making it less susceptible to acid attack and allows the eroded tooth surface to remineralise. Ideally, confine these items exclusively to mealtime.\n\n9. Consume food items enriched with calcium or stimulates the flow of saliva. For instance, dairy products such as milk & cheese. Saliva acts as a buffer which resists abrupt changes in pH in the mouth and keeps it neutral. Moreover, it aids the precipitation of calcium phosphate under specific pH conditions and bathes the tooth surface in fluoride, both of which promote remineralisation.\n\n10. Drink through a straw to reduce localised contact between erosive fluids and the teeth. Similarly, drinks should not be held in the mouth or sipped for a long period of time. Otherwise, rinse your mouth thoroughly with water or chew sugar-free gum immediately after as it removes residual food debris and lowers the pH of saliva. The result of salivary flow rate and salivary pH from chewing gum for 20 minutes is significantly greater than resting flow rate.\n\n11. Avoid abrasive forces by brushing gently using a soft bristled hand toothbrush. In-vitro research has shown that there is a higher potential for abrasion on erosive enamel & dentine with an electric toothbrush as compared to a manual toothbrush. Furthermore, delay brushing of teeth until approximately an hour after an acidic meal to prevent the removal of softened tooth substance.\n\n12. Use remineralising agents, such as sodium fluoride in the form of either a fluoride mouth rinse, toothpaste and varnish. Fluoride-containing products block exposed dentine tubules, reducing its permeability hence inducing hypersensitivity and pain.\n\nB: Dental professionals\n\n13. To facilitate detection and diagnosis, dental professionals should be aware of the appearance of tooth erosion – short, cupped, saucer-shaped with a glassy, shiny surface and loss of surface architecture. Several teeth are affected at the same time, with the most commonly affected area being the tongue surfaces of the upper front teeth.\n\n14. Recording index. Use the Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE), an objective four-level scoring system to determine the severity of erosion in each sextant. The cumulative score corresponds to its level of risk and acts as a guide for appropriate management. The distribution of BEWE scores is said to be more accurate than that of Tooth wear index (TWI) scores.\n\n● 0= no erosive tooth wear\n\n● 1= initial loss of surface texture\n\n● 2= distinct defect, hard tissue loss < 50% of surface area\n\n● 3= hard tissue loss ≥ 50% of surface area\n\n15. Treating dental erosion – the first line treatment after detection of acid erosion is remineralisation. Remineralisation is the reparative process of tooth substance. It is commonly done by applying fluoride-containing substances onto the surfaces of affected teeth. The following are some methods of remineralization: professionally-applied fluoride varnish, home-applied fluoride gel and toothpaste with stannous fluoride formulation. There is evidence showing that toothpastes containing stannous fluoride is more remineralising when compared to conventional sodium fluoride formulations.\n\n16. Restoration is the process of building back lost tooth structure to restore their function, integrity and morphology. The type of restorative treatment depends on the degree of damage that has been done:\n\na. Small area of erosion along the biting surfaces of tooth can be restored using detection of acid erosion is resin composite filling. This is a tooth-coloured filling material commonly used to restore decayed teeth.\n\nb. Moderate degree of damage at upper from teeth can be restored using detection of acid erosion is ceramic or resin composite veneers. A veneer is a thin piece of tooth-coloured, custom-made shells that cover the front side of teeth.\n\nc. Large extent of damage, involving two or more surfaces of tooth can be restored using ceramic crowns or overlays. Crowns are tooth-shaped capsplaced over the damaged tooth to restore its shape; Overlays are pre-built fillings that are used to rebuild the pointed parts of back teeth (known as cusps).\n\nHowever, long-term treatment success is only possible when the causes of acid erosion are eradicated. Otherwise, the erosive process will continue to destroy tooth substance. To achieve best outcomes, combining active treatment with preventive measures and recall at regular periods is needed.\n\nC: Industry\n\n17. Avoid having environments where there is repeated exposure and inhalation of acidic particles in occupational areas when possible as several case reports have proven a link between this and the prevalence of dental erosion. Alternatively, subsidiseregular dental services for those with higher risk of developing the condition. For instance, professional wine tasters, competitive swimmers and industrial workers working in factories that involve batteries, galvanizing or ammunition.\n\n18. Educate workers on potential occupational hazards and promote maintenance of good oral health. For instance, standardise behaviours such as wearing personal protective equipment for the eyes and face and gargling during or after working.\n\n19. Alter pH or chelation properties of acidic soft drinks, particularly those with citric or phosphoric acid by reducing its composition. Tooth enamel is composed of calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite. Chelating agents like hydrogen ions combine with carbonate or phosphate releasing ions in the region, thereby causing direct surface etching hence tissue loss.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915189", "title": "Pari passu", "text": "Pari passu\n\nPari passu is a Latin phrase that literally means \"with an equal step\" or \"on equal footing\". It is sometimes translated as \"ranking equally\", \"hand-in-hand\", \"with equal force\", or \"moving together\", and by extension, \"fairly\", \"without partiality\".\n\nThis term is commonly used in law. \"Black's Law Dictionary\" (8th ed., 2004) defines \"pari passu\" as \"proportionally; at an equal pace; without preference\". \n\nIn inheritance, an \"in pari passu\" (\"per capita\") distribution can be distinguished from a \"per stirpes\" (by family branch) distribution. \n\nFor example, suppose a testator had two children A and B. A has two children, and B has three. The testator leaves his entire estate to his grandchildren in equal shares \"in pari passu\", each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate. If the testator left his entire estate to his grandchildren \"per stirpes\" (by family branch), the children of A would share one half of the estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them. \n\nThe problem with a per capita \"in pari passu\" distribution in the example given is as follows. Assume A dies before B. On A's death a distribution could not be made to his or her children: they would have to await the death of B – on the assumption that B could have additional children, and thereby consequently all grandchildren (of both A and B) would be entitled to less than one fifth each.\n\nThis term is also often used in the lending area and in bankruptcy proceedings, where creditors are said to be paid \"pari passu\", or each creditor is paid \"pro rata\" in accordance with the amount of his claim. Here its meaning is \"equally and without preference\".\nThere have been cases where decisions were based on different interpretations of the term.\n\nIn the European Union, as the result of the Greek government-debt crisis, a retroactive Collective action clause passed by the Greek government with the support of the ECB and IMF, enabled the debtor (who also controlled the courts) to impose a 70% loss on the creditors, more than 75% of whom had voted in favour of the cut. In this case, \"pari passu\" means that all private-sector investors are equally treated.\n\n\n"}

Written by original frontman Syd Barrett and recorded on 23 May 1967, it has \"The Scarecrow\" as its B-side. It was released as a non-album single, but appeared as the opening track of the U.S. edition of the band's debut album \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" (1967).\n\n\"See Emily Play\" is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and reached No. 6 in the United Kingdom singles chart. As of 2018, the song has never been mixed to stereo, so the US album version was rechannelled and all subsequent reissues have been in mono.\n\n\"See Emily Play\" is also known as \"Games for May\", after a free concert in which Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd performed.\n\nThe song was reportedly about a girl named Emily, who Barrett claimed to have seen while sleeping in the woods after taking a psychedelic drug. According to \"A Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey\", by Nicholas Schaffner, Emily is the Honourable Emily Young, daughter of Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet and nicknamed \"the psychedelic schoolgirl\" at the UFO Club.. \n\nIt has been suggested by some that the slide guitar effect was produced by Barrett using a Zippo lighter, but elsewhere that he used a plastic ruler.\n\nThe train depicted on the single's sleeve was drawn by Barrett.\n\nThe details as to the recording remain shrouded in mystery due to the lack of paperwork in the EMI archive. Engineer Jeff Jarrett recalls that \"See Emily Play\" was recorded in a much longer form which was then edited down for the single release. It was recorded at Sound Techniques studios on 21 May 1967. There was much trickery involved in the recording with backward tapes, much use of echo and reverb, and the first piano bridge between the first chorus and second verse was recorded at a slow pace then sped up for the final master. The four-track master tape was wiped or misplaced. It no longer exists and has never been mixed into true stereo; it was reprocessed for fake stereo on the 1971 \"Relics\" compilation.\n\nBarrett, reputedly, was not happy with the final studio cut, and he protested against its release, which producer Norman Smith speculated was based on his fear of commercialism. During sessions for the song David Gilmour visited the studio, on Barrett's invitation, and was shocked by the perceived changes in Barrett's personality when he did not appear to recognize him. For many years Gilmour would recall this, saying, \"I'll go on record as saying, that was when he changed\".\n\nThe US single (Tower 356) was released by Tower Records three times between July 1967 and late 1968. Each time it failed to duplicate its UK success. The song only stayed in the band's set list for a few months, and was last played on 25 November 1967 in Blackpool.\n\n\"See Emily Play\" later appeared on a number of compilations: \"Relics\" (1971), \"Works\" (1983), \"Shine On\" (1992), \"\" (2001), \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" 40th Anniversary Edition (2007), \"\" (2011) and \"The Early Years 1965–1972\" (2016). The song was also included on the Barrett retrospective \"An Introduction to Syd Barrett\" (2010).\n\nPink Floyd performed the song three times on BBC TV's \"Top of the Pops\". On each occasion, they mimed to the single, over which Barrett sang a live vocal. The BBC wiped the shows all of which were \"live\" transmissions. In late 2009 a badly damaged home video recording was recovered by the British Film Institute containing the first and third show the song was performed on, though only the first appearance was recoverable in part. The first performance was on the 6 July 1967 edition hosted by Alan Freeman. Parts of this performance have been recovered from the damaged video recording.\n\nThey returned for the following week's edition, 13 July, hosted by Pete Murray. Barrett complained that the band shouldn't appear, because \"John Lennon doesn't have to do \"Top of the Pops\"\". He did perform, but without the enthusiasm of the previous week. \nThe recoverable parts of the 6 July performance were given a public screening in London on 9 January 2010 at an event called \"Missing Believed Wiped\" devoted to recovered TV shows. It was the first time any footage of the performance had been seen since its original broadcast. The Pink Floyd management used a copy of the footage in \"The Early Years 1965–1972\".\n\nThe band were booked to appear on this edition of \"Beat-Club\". Barrett had suffered \"nervous exhaustion\" and the band decided to take a month-long break in the hope his health would recover. The appearance thus had to be cancelled.\n\nIn 1968, Pink Floyd travelled to Belgium where they filmed a TV special for the Dutch language television programme \"Tienerklanken\". Erroneously titled \"Pink Floid\", this special featured lip-synched promotional films for \"See Emily Play\", as well as for \"Astronomy Domine\", \"The Scarecrow\", \"Apples and Oranges\", \"Paint Box\", \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\", and \"Corporal Clegg\". This was Gilmour's first TV work with the band. Barrett was still technically a member of the band but it had recently been decided to no longer include him in gigs and shows. Gilmour, Roger Waters and Rick Wright thus had to mime to Barrett's vocals.\n\nPart of the vocal melody was played on a Minimoog by Rick Wright at the very end of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)\" at the end of 1975's \"Wish You Were Here\", as a tribute to Barrett.\n\n\"See Emily Play\" has been covered by Canadian group Three to One (aka Okee Pokey Band) on the 1967 Yorkville album \"CTV After Four\"; David Bowie, for his \"Pin Ups\" album in 1973; Japanese group Salon Music, for their 1984 album \"La Paloma Show\"; The Grapes of Wrath, as a B-side on the 1991 CD single \"I Am Here\"; on the 1996 Games for May EP by perfect children; Arjen Anthony Lucassen, on his 1997 album \"Strange Hobby\"; The Changelings, on their 2002 album \"Astronomica\"; Judy Dyble, for her album \"Spindle\"; David West, on the 2001 bluegrass tribute album \"Pickin' on Pink Floyd: A Bluegrass Tribute\"; Martha Wainwright, on her 2008 album \"I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too\"; and by 3, on the 2008 re-release of their album \"The End Is Begun\". John Frusciante has played it live. All About Eve played the song live c. 1992 and recorded a demo, which was not released until 2006 as part of the \"Keepsakes\" compilation. A parody appears on the 2013 album \"Cover Your Ears\" by French Canadian duo Sèxe Illégal. The song is renamed \"Si Émile est gay\" or \"If Emile is gay\". \nThe song was played by Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets in 2018.\n\n\"See Emily Play\" is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\" list.\n\nAn EP including the song was released in Spain in 1967, on the La Voz De Su Amo label. All tracks were written by Syd Barrett.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It answers to Congress, not the President of the United States, and is the only full-service federal law enforcement agency responsible to the legislative branch of the Federal Government of the United States.\n\nThe United States Capitol Police has the primary responsibility for protecting life and property; preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal acts; and enforcing traffic regulations throughout a large complex of congressional buildings, parks, and thoroughfares. The Capitol Police has exclusive jurisdiction within all buildings and grounds of the United States Capitol complex as well as the Library of Congress. It also has concurrent jurisdiction with other law enforcement agencies, including the United States Park Police and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, in an area of approximately 200 blocks around the complex. Officers also have jurisdiction throughout the District of Columbia to take enforcement action when they observe or are made aware of crimes of violence while on official duties. Additionally, they are charged with the protection of members of Congress, officers of Congress, and their families throughout the entire United States, its territories and possessions, and the District of Columbia. While performing protective functions, the Capitol Police have jurisdiction throughout the entire United States.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police is one of many agencies that sends its recruits to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), located in Glynco, Georgia, for initial training. Rarely, recruits are sent to the FLETC location in Artesia, NM. Following 12 weeks at FLETC, recruits return to FLETC's location in Cheltenham, Maryland, for an additional 13 weeks of training. After the recruits' academy training, graduates are sworn in as law enforcement officers and assigned to one of four divisions to begin their careers. Once assigned, officers are assigned a Field Training Officer (FTO) for a definite period to provide additional on-the-job training. FTO's provide weekly updates on the subjects that have been learned and issue tests to the new officers. Officers are also subject to a one-year probationary period. Initial salary at the start of training is $55,653.00, with an increase to $57,604.00 after graduation. After 30 months of satisfactory performance and promotion to private first class (PFC), salary is increased to $64,590.00.\n\nThe history of the United States Capitol Police dates back to 1801 when Congress moved from the city of Philadelphia to the newly constructed Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. At the time, Congress appointed one watchman to protect the building and Congressional property.\n\nThe police were formally created by Congress in 1828 following the assault on a son of John Quincy Adams in the Capitol rotunda. The United States Capitol Police had as its original duty the provision of security for the United States Capitol.\n\nIts mission has expanded to provide the Congressional community and its visitors with a variety of security services. These services are provided through the use of a variety of specialty support units, a network of foot and vehicular patrols, fixed posts, a full-time Containment and Emergency Response Team (CERT), K-9, a Patrol/Mobile Response Division and a full-time Hazardous Devices and Hazardous Materials Sections.\n\nThe Library of Congress Police were merged into the force in 2009. The agency has at least 1,800 sworn personnel.\n\nThe current chief of the United States Capitol Police is Steven Sund.\n\nOne USCP officer, Sergeant Christopher Eney, was killed in a training accident on August 24, 1984.\n\nTwo USCP officers have been killed by hostile action. A mentally disturbed gunman named Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., killed Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson in the United States Capitol shooting incident on July 24, 1998. Chestnut and Gibson were laid in honor in the Rotunda before burial in Arlington National Cemetery. Chestnut was the first African American ever to lie in honor in the Rotunda.\n\n"}
{"id": "1915216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915216", "title": "Bifilar coil", "text": "Bifilar coil\n\nA bifilar coil is an electromagnetic coil that contains two closely spaced, parallel windings. In engineering, the word \"bifilar\" describes wire which is made of two filaments or strands. It is commonly used to denote special types of winding wire for transformers. Wire can be purchased in bifilar form, usually as different colored enameled wire bonded together. For three strands, the term trifilar coil is used.\n\nSome bifilars have adjacent coils in which the convolutions are arranged so that the potential difference is magnified (i.e., the current flows in same parallel direction). Others are wound so that the current flows in opposite directions. The magnetic field created by one winding is therefore equal and opposite to that created by the other, resulting in a net magnetic field of zero (i.e., neutralizing any negative effects in the coil). In electrical terms, this means that the self-inductance of the coil is zero.\n\nThe bifilar coil (more often called the \"bifilar winding\") is used in modern electrical engineering as a means of constructing wire-wound resistors with negligible parasitic self-inductance.\nA different type of bifilar coil is used in some relay windings and transformers used for a switched-mode power supply to suppress back-emf. In this case, the two wire coils are closely spaced and wound in parallel but are electrically isolated from each other. The primary coil is driven to operate the relay, and the secondary coil is short-circuited inside the case. When the current through the primary is interrupted, as happens when the relay is switched off, most of the magnetic energy is intercepted by the secondary coil which converts it to heat in its internal resistance. This is only one of several methods of absorbing the energy from the primary coil before it can damage the device (usually a vulnerable semiconductor) that drives the relay. The main disadvantage of this method is that it greatly increases the switching time of the relay. \n\nWhen used in a switching transformer, one winding of the bifilar coil is used as a means of removing the energy stored in the stray magnetic flux which fails to link the \"primary coil\" to the \"secondary coil\" of the transformer. Because of their proximity, the wires of the bifilar coil both \"see\" the same stray magnetic flux. One wire is clamped to ground usually by a diode so that when the other \"primary\" wire of the bifilar coil no longer has a voltage applied across it by the switching transistor, the stray magnetic flux generates a current in the clamping coil with the primary side voltage appearing across it, causing an equal voltage to appear across the primary winding. If this clamping coil was not used, the stray magnetic flux would attempt to force a current to flow through the primary wire. Since the primary wire is switched off and the switching transistor is in a high resistance state, the high voltage which would appear on the semiconductor switching transistor would exceed its electrical breakdown or even damage it.\n\nBifilar coils impose an inductance in the common mode, but impose no inductance in the differential mode. Coils in such a combination are widely used to eliminate ingress or egress of common mode signals from electronic signalling circuits. This arrangement is used in transmission and reception magnetics of Ethernet cables and conspicuously in the form of a ferrite bead clamped to the outside of USB, laptop power supply and HDMI cables.\n\nGerman physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber made use of the bifilar coil in his 1848 electrodynamometer. Large examples were used in inventor Daniel McFarland Cook's 1871 \"Electro-Magnetic Battery\" and Nikola Tesla's high frequency power experiments at the end of the 1800s. Nikola Tesla patented the Bifilar Coil on January 9, 1894, referring to it as a “Coil for Electro Magnets”.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915219", "title": "KABC-TV", "text": "KABC-TV\n\nKABC-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 7, is an ABC owned-and-operated television station licensed to Los Angeles, California, United States, serving as the network's West Coast flagship outlet. The station is owned by the ABC Owned Television Stations subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. KABC-TV's studios are located in the Grand Central Business Centre of Glendale, and its transmitter is located on Mount Wilson.\n\nIn the few areas of the western United States where an ABC station is not receivable over the air, KABC-TV is available on satellite television through DirecTV.\n\nChannel 7 first signed on the air under the call sign KECA on September 16, 1949. It was the last television station licensed to Los Angeles operating on the VHF band to debut and the last of ABC's five original owned-and-operated stations to make its debut, after San Francisco's KGO-TV, which signed on four months earlier. It was also the last of the Los Angeles \"classic seven\" TV stations which were originally on the VHF dial, prior to the 2009 digital conversions. (No other stations debuted in Los Angeles until 1962, when the first two UHF Los Angeles stations launched (KIIX [now KWHY-TV] and KMEX-TV, channels 22 and 34, respectively).\n\nThe station's call sign was named after Los Angeles broadcasting pioneer Earle C. Anthony, whose initials were also present on channel 7's then-sister radio station, KECA (790 AM, now KABC). On February 1, 1954, KECA-TV changed its call sign to KABC-TV.\n\nOriginally, KABC-TV was located at the ABC Television Center, now called The Prospect Studios, on Prospect Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, east of Hollywood. In 2000, KABC-TV moved to nearby Glendale into a new state-of-the-art facility designed by César Pelli, as part of the Disney Grand Central Creative Campus (GC3), in the Grand Central Business Centre on the site of the former Grand Central Airport. The station is currently located east (along the corridor of the Los Angeles River and State Route 134) of ABC's West Coast headquarters on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank.\n\nKABC-TV has used the Circle 7 logo since 1962 (the same year ABC created and implemented its current logo) and augmented its bottom left quadrant with the ABC network logo in 1997. The station's news anchors and reporters wear Circle 7 lapel pins when they appear on camera, a practice that had once been standard at each of the original five ABC-owned stations.\n\nOn February 4, 2006, KABC-TV became the first television station in the state of California to broadcast its local newscasts in high definition using HD cameras in the studio. Along with the in-house upgrades, the station debuted its updated news set and theme music to Frank Gari's \"Eyewitness News\".\n\nKABC-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, at noon on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations. After the transition occurred, some viewers had difficulty receiving KABC's signal, despite operating at a high effective radiated power of 25,000 watts. On March 31, 2009, KABC-TV filed an application with the FCC to upgrade its signal strength to 28,700 watts. It was granted a construction permit on March 3, 2011.\n\nIn July 2010, The Walt Disney Company became engaged in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable. This dispute involved KABC-TV and three other ABC owned-and-operated stations, Disney Channel and the ESPN family of networks. If a deal had not been made, all of the Disney-owned channels would have been removed from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems across the United States. The companies reached a long-term agreement to keep the stations and their sister cable channels on Time Warner Cable and its co-managed systems on September 2, 2010.\n\nDigital channel 7.3 previously carried programming from The Local AccuWeather Channel; it was replaced with a standard-definition feed of the Live Well Network in 2010. On April 15, 2015, the comedy network Laff replaced the standard-definition feed of LWN on 7.3. ABC Stations rebranded Live Well Network on .2 as Localish on February 17, 2020 to add an outlet for the Localish lifestyle content.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKABC-TV currently broadcasts 51 hours and 25 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday; 6½ hours on Saturdays; and 7 hours on Sundays). As is typical of ABC stations and major network affiliates in general, KABC-TV produces an hour-long newscast at 4 p.m. on weekend afternoons. KABC-TV formerly operated a news bureau in California's state capital of Sacramento, sharing resources with sister stations KGO-TV in San Francisco and KFSN-TV in Fresno; the bureau was closed in 2014. The station also has bureaus located within its viewing area, in Riverside and Orange. In the 1980s, the station also had a bureau located in Ventura.\n\n\"Lew Irwin Reports\", the station's first locally produced newscast, debuted in 1957. Initially, the 15-minute program was broadcast Monday through Saturday at 11:00 p.m. and featured Irwin delivering a news summary prepared by KABC Radio news writers, followed by a seven-minute feature written by Irwin that included footage shot for the program by the MGM-owned newsreel company Telenews. Irwin interviewed a host of public figures for the program, including former President Harry S. Truman, former Senator John F. Kennedy, philosopher Bertrand Russell, actor Marlon Brando, H-bomb scientist Edward Teller, and poets Robert Frost and Carl Sandburg. Irwin's features often included news-breaking investigations into such controversial topics as migrant workers, police brutality, proprietary hospitals, disc jockey payola, the Hollywood blacklist, and the John Birch Society. In a letter to the chief of ABC News, James Hagerty, in 1961, Sandburg wrote: \"He is one of the great reporters in America today...I could make a case that he is one of the most useful citizens.\" In 1962, a new KABC-TV program director for the station mounted a second newscast on the station (following John Daly's network newscast in the early evening) presented by Ed Fleming, who had previously worked for rival KNXT. A few months later, he decided to feature Fleming and Irwin on both the early-evening and late-night newscasts, with Fleming delivering the news and Irwin a long-form feature. After numerous clashes between the program director and Irwin, Irwin resigned in 1962 citing creative differences. He was eventually succeeded by KCOP newscaster Baxter Ward, who was backed by the station's first staff film crew.\n\nKABC-TV first adopted the \"Eyewitness News\" format for its newscasts in February 1969, not long after it became popular on New York City sister station WABC-TV. Like the other ABC-owned stations, KABC-TV used the \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the soundtrack of the 1967 film \"Cool Hand Luke\" as its theme music, and continued to use it even after other channels adopted an updated version of the theme, the Frank Gari-composed \"News Series 2000\". Later on, the original \"Cool Hand Luke\" theme was used by the station only during the main newscast. The station's newscasts used a synthesized version of the old theme (composed by Frank Becker) during the mid-1980s, before KABC-TV picked up the \"News Series 2000\" package in 1990. In 1995, KABC began using Gari Media Group's \"Eyewitness News\" music package, which remains as the station's news theme.\n\nBill Bonds and Stu Nahan were KABC-TV's first anchor team under the Eyewitness News banner. Within two years, unable to upend the dominance of KNXT (now KCBS-TV)'s \"The Big News\" and \"Eleven O'Clock Report\" with Jerry Dunphy and KNBC's \"Newservice\" format, Bonds returned to his previous ABC assignment at WXYZ-TV in Detroit and Nahan became the station's lead sportscaster. A succession of anchors – Joseph Benti, Barney Morris, John Schubeck and Judd Hambrick – followed, but the newscast gained its greatest growth in August 1975 when KABC-TV hired Dunphy as its lead anchor, following his firing from KNXT. Though initially paired with newcomer John Hambrick, Dunphy later partnered with reporter Christine Lund, and that duo led KABC-TV to local news supremacy well into the 1980s. Others who have reported or anchored for KABC-TV include Lisa McRee, Harold Greene, Tawny Little, Laura Diaz, Paul Moyer, Chuck Henry, Johnny Mountain, George Fischbeck, Judd Rose, and Bill Weir. Former KABC-TV sports reporters and anchors include former NFL players Lynn Swann, Gene Washington, Jim Hill, and Bob Chandler; and former Major League Baseball player (and current Los Angeles Dodgers radio analyst and play-by-play announcer) Rick Monday.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the station's newscasts often included spirited miniature debates and commentaries reflecting various political viewpoints. Several notable politicians and political pundits appeared on these segments, including Proposition 13 backer Howard Jarvis, former U.S. Representative and Senator John Tunney, Bruce Herschensohn, Bill Press and Baxter Ward. In addition, KABC-TV aired brief editorials from the station's general manager, most notably John Severino, who served throughout the 1980s. This practice was discontinued in 1990.\n\nDuring the 1980s, KABC-TV was one of a few stations in the country to run a three-hour block of local newscasts on weekdays from 4 to 7 p.m. The station was the first in the region to introduce an hour-long newscast at 4 p.m., first anchored by Jerry Dunphy and Tawny Little in September 1980. Before this, the station ran two hours of news from 5 to 7 p.m. The station reduced this block by one half-hour in 1990, when it moved \"World News Tonight\" from 7 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. For a time in the late 1980s, its 6:30 p.m. newscast was titled \"Eyewitness Update\" and served as a final recap of the day's news, similar in nature to an 11 p.m. newscast. KABC-TV is one of three ABC stations on the West Coast to air \"World News\" at 6:30 p.m. (the two other ABC stations to do this being KGTV in San Diego and KAEF in Eureka); most other ABC stations in the western United States run the program at either 5:30 or 6:00 p.m. When the network soap opera \"Port Charles\" ended its run in 2003, KABC-TV expanded its midday newscast to a full hour. Occasionally, KABC-TV has aired the live East Coast edition of \"World News Tonight\" at 3:30 p.m.; ABC has faced allegations that this additional airing is intended to increase the program's total audience.\n\nOn January 13, 2014, KABC-TV began producing an hour-long evening newscast on Anaheim-based independent KDOC-TV (channel 56); the newscast airs seven nights a week. Concurrently, KDOC also added a midnight rebroadcast of KABC's 11 p.m. newscast. KABC is the fifth ABC owned-and-operated station to enter into a news share agreement (after WTVD, KGO-TV, WPVI-TV and KFSN-TV). On May 31, 2016, KABC added a 3 p.m. newscast on weekdays, competing with KTLA's newscast at that time slot. On September 10, 2018, KABC became the third television station in the market to expand its weekday morning newscast to three hours, with an additional half-hour at 4:00 a.m.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, the KABC-TV studios in Glendale were evacuated due to a bomb threat. The station's employees were evacuated and forced the station off-the-air; the suspect who was responsible for the threat was a 22-year-old Glendale man, who was arrested on October 14, 2015. As a result, the 4:00 p.m. newscast was temporarily moved outside the studio, while the police swept the studio with bomb-sniffing dogs inside. At 4:42 p.m., the station's employees were allowed to re-enter the studio and the newscast continued from the studio after the threat.\n\nIn February 2017, the station's news helicopter, AIR7HD, received an upgrade and debuted two new features: XTREME Vision and SkyMap7. XTREME Vision uses an advanced zoom lens and is able to track vehicle speeds in real time. SkyMap7 uses augmented reality to allow viewers to see street names overlaying the camera, which allows for the identification of streets at night. Both features are powered by the SHOTOVER F1 Live.\n\nThe introduction of the \"Eyewitness News\" format, followed by the addition of syndicated staples such as \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 1986, \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" and its predecessors in 1991, and \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" in 1992, has allowed KABC-TV to maintain a substantial ratings advantage over its competition. Leveraging the strength of its sizeable lead-in at 3 p.m. by the now-defunct \"Oprah\", KABC-TV has long held first or second in the ratings for its 4 to 6:30 p.m. news block. However, ratings leads for the morning and late news have typically been expensive battles with local stations KTLA and KTTV in the morning, and KNBC (and recently KCBS-TV) at 11 p.m.\n\nWith its across-the-board ratings success in hand, the station has been known to run quick five-second promos throughout the day that feature the slogan, \"ABC7 – #1 in news, #1 in Southern California.\" This is a throwback to its openers during the 1980s, when the station proudly proclaimed itself \"Number One in Southern California.\" On November 1, 2015, the station debuted a new set along with new graphics.\n\nKABC-TV, as well as the other Disney owned television stations, has a large presence on several social media platforms. In May 2014, it was announced that the station was the first one in the United States to surpass one million likes on Facebook.\n\n\n\nOwing to its common ownership with ESPN, KABC-TV became the designated broadcast home of Los Angeles Rams games in 2016 for the team's appearances on \"Monday Night Football\". KABC-TV only carries the Rams' \"Monday Night Football\" games from that year onward while other games are split between four other television stations: KCBS-TV through the \"NFL on CBS\" and its preseason Rams telecasts, including the network's Thursday night games (2016–2017), KNBC through \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" and NBC-produced Thursday night games (2016–2017), KTLA through games telecast exclusively by NFL Network, and KTTV through \"Fox NFL Sunday\" and Fox-produced Thursday night games (2018–present). The station also produces and broadcasts the Rams' team shows on Saturday nights during the regular season, with comedian Jay Mohr serving as host. The same broadcast schedule applies for the Los Angeles Chargers, after they relocated from San Diego. The station also carries NFL postseason wild card games. The Chargers named KABC-TV the team's official English-language television broadcaster beginning in 2017, giving KABC-TV access to preseason telecasts and weekly magazines.\n\nIn addition, KABC-TV carries NBA games involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers through the league's contract with the network. The station has carried the Lakers' 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2010 NBA Finals appearances, including the team's championship victories in the latter two years.\n\nKABC-TV served as the home station for the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles.\n\nKABC-TV produces several local shows including \"Vista L.A.\" (which profiles Latino life in Southern California), and \"Eye on L.A.\" (which has been on the air in some form since the early 1980s). On weekends, the station airs \"Eyewitness Newsmakers\", hosted by reporter Adrienne Alpert. The station produces sports shows under various names throughout the year, all formerly under the name \"ABC 7 Sports Zone\", which formerly originated from the ESPN Zone in Anaheim: \"Rams Primetime Saturday\" airs following the network's telecasts of Saturday Night college football games; during the NBA season, the station airs \"Slam Dunk Saturday/Sunday\" following Saturday night and Sunday afternoon games. Most \"ABC 7 Sports Zone\" shows previously originated from local sports venues including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Exposition Park, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, and Staples Center in Los Angeles, but shows are now produced from the station's Glendale studios. It is hosted by Rob Fukuzaki, and is joined during the basketball season by former Laker great Michael Cooper. The program is a spin-off of \"Monday Night Live\", which aired on KABC-TV from 1989 until \"Monday Night Football\" left the network after the 2005 NFL season. That show was hosted by Todd Donoho until 1997, and later Bill Weir and Rob Fukuzaki and featured an extensive trivia contest.\n\nPrior to ABC's annual telecasts of the Academy Awards, KABC-TV produces a live pre-awards show and post-awards show, \"On the Red Carpet at the Oscars\", featuring red carpet interviews and fashion commentary. This show also airs on the network's other O&O stations and is syndicated to several ABC affiliates and other broadcasters outside the country.\n\nIn the past, KABC-TV featured various locally produced shows such as \"AM Los Angeles\"; a morning talk show which at various times featured personalities Regis Philbin, Sarah Purcell, Ralph Story, Tawny Little, Cristina Ferrare, Cyndy Garvey, and Steve Edwards as hosts. Edwards also hosted a short-lived afternoon show in the mid-1980s called \"330\", which aired after the ABC soap opera \"The Edge of Night\" (\"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", formerly co-hosted by Philbin until 2011 and produced at New York sister station WABC-TV, now occupies the former time slot of \"AM Los Angeles\").\n\nOn April 30, 1954, KABC-TV aired a preview program, \"Dig Me Later, Vampira\", hosted by Maila Nurmi at 11 p.m. \"The Vampira Show\" premiered on the same night. For the first four weeks, the show aired at midnight, and it moved to 11 p.m. on May 29. Ten months later, on March 5, 1955, the series began airing at 10:30 p.m. As Vampira, Nurmi introduced films while wandering through a hallway of mist and cobwebs. Her horror-related comedy antics included talking to her pet spider Rollo and encouraging viewers to write for epitaphs instead of autographs. When the series was cancelled in 1955, she retained rights to the character of Vampira.\n\nIn 1964, Pinky Lee attempted a return to kids television by hosting a local children's comedy program on KABC-TV. The series was also seen in national syndication from 1964 to 1965. But the program fell prey to creative interference from the show's producers and from station management. Lee tried to fight off the creative interference, but his efforts were for naught. The 1960s version of \"The Pinky Lee Kids TV Show\" went off the air after one season.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, the station also produced a weekly entertainment program \"OnTheRedCarpet\", hosted by Rachel Smith.

The film narrates the story of David Carr, an unemployed worker and member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, who decides to fight for the republican side in the Spanish Civil War, an anti-rebel coalition of Socialists, Communists and Anarchists. The film won the FIPRESCI International Critics Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes.\n\nThe film's narrative unfolds in a long flashback. David Carr has died at an old age and his granddaughter discovers old letters, newspapers and other documents in his room: what we see in the film is what he had lived.\n\nCarr, a young unemployed worker and member of the Communist Party, leaves Liverpool and travels to Spain to join the International Brigades. He crosses the Spanish border in Catalonia and coincidentally ends up enlisted in a POUM militia commanded by Lawrence, in the Aragon front. In this company, as in all POUM militias, men and women – such as the young and enthusiastic Maite – fight together. In the following weeks and months he becomes friends with other foreign volunteers, like the French Bernard and the Irish Coogan, and the latter's girlfriend Blanca – with whom David Carr later falls in love – also a member of POUM, and also the ideologue of his group.\n\nAfter being wounded and recovering in a hospital in Barcelona, he finally joins – in accordance with his original plan and against the opinion of Blanca – the government-backed International Brigades, and he encounters the Soviet propaganda and repression against POUM members and anarchists; he then returns to his old company, only to see them rounded up by a government unit requiring their surrender: in a brief clash Blanca is killed. After her funeral he returns to Great Britain with a red neckerchief full of Spanish earth.\n\nFinally the film comes back to the present, and we see Carr's funeral, in which his granddaughter throws the Spanish earth into his grave after speaking lines from \"The Day Is Coming\", a poem by William Morris.\n\"Join in the battle wherein no man can fail,\"\n<br>\"For whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still prevail.\"\nAfterwards she performs a raised fist salute, honouring his beliefs.\n\n\nAccording to Ken Loach, the most important scene of the film is the debate in an assembly of a village successfully liberated by the militia. People from the actual village where the film was shot play peasant parts in the film and express their thoughts freely (despite language difficulties), and a debate ensues about whether or not to collectivise the village land and that of the recently shot priest. An American with the POUM militia argues that the war effort must come first, suggesting that collectivisation and other revolutionary actions might hamper that effort. He mentions that if such actions and the slogans accompanying them continue, they will not gain the support of powerful capitalist regimes such as the United States and Britain (\"You're scaring them\", he says). The necessity of a contemporaneous war and revolution is expressed by a German militiaman, who says that 'in Germany revolution was postponed and now Hitler is in power'. In the end the villagers vote for collectivisation, thereby taking steps on a far-left path. In the anarchist and socialist controlled areas this kind of expropriation of land was common, as the civil war was accompanied by a social revolution.\n\nAs in the above scene, various languages: Spanish, English and Catalan are spoken throughout the film, and subtitles are used selectively. Carr arrives in Spain without knowing any Spanish, but gradually picks it up – and luckily for him English is the \"lingua franca\" in his militia.\n\nThe social revolution was opposed by both the Soviet-supported communists and the democratic republicans and as the war progressed, the government and the communists were able to leverage their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, both through diplomacy and force. An historical event, the bloody fight between Republicans and Anarchists for controlling the Telefónica building in Barcelona, has been chosen by Loach as an emblem of this internal conflict (See Barcelona May Days). Carr's disenchantment starts from this meaningless fight, which he fails to understand because both groups were supposed to be on the same side. At one point he is guarding the Communist Party headquarters in Barcelona and engages in banter across the barricades with the anarchists opposite. He asks a Mancunian among them \"Why aren't you over here with us?\" In reply his compatriot asks him the same question and Carr answers \"I don't know\".\n\nAnother important moment inspired by actual events is the execution of a village priest for acting in favour of the fascist side: he has broken the seal of confessions, telling the fascists where the anarchists were hiding and causing their deaths. The priest is also shown to have a bruised shoulder from firing a rifle.\n\nMost critics and viewers noted the similarity between the story narrated in this film and George Orwell's book \"Homage to Catalonia\", in which the author wrote one of the more famous accounts of the war, that of his own experience as a volunteer in the ILP Contingent, part of the POUM militia.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 77% approval rating based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10, .\n\nDavid Armstrong, cinema critic for The San Francisco Examiner, stated in SF Gate that \"Veteran British director Ken Loach continues to toil in the fields of a now largely, and unjustly, eclipsed tradition: European social realism. Working in a near-documentary style that emphasizes the grit of everyday life, the cynical secretiveness of political leaders and the nobility of small people with big dreams, Loach makes feature films of uncommon gravity and integrity\".\n\nPhilip French writing in The Observer said, \"scripted by his regular collaborator, Jim Allen, Loach's movie is a visceral, emotional and intellectual experience, and among the finest films of the decade.\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915235", "title": "Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir", "text": "Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir\n\nThe insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir (also Kashmiri Insurgency, or Kashmir Intifada) is an uprising or revolt against the Indian administration of Jammu and Kashmir, a region constituting the southern portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947.\n\nJammu and Kashmir, long a breeding ground of separatist ambitions, has been wracked by the insurgency since 1989. Although the failure of Indian governance and democracy lay at the root of the initial disaffection, Pakistan played an important role in converting the latter into a fully developed insurgency. Some insurgent groups in Kashmir support the complete independence, whereas others seek accession to Pakistan.\n\nMore explicitly, the roots of the insurgency are tied to a dispute over local autonomy. Democratic development was limited in Kashmir until the late 1970s and by 1988 many of the democratic reforms provided by the Indian government had been reversed and non-violent channels for expressing discontent were limited and caused a dramatic increase in support for insurgents advocating violent secession from India. In 1987, a disputed State election created a catalyst for the insurgency when it resulted in some of the state's legislative assembly members forming armed insurgent groups. In July 1988, a series of demonstrations, strikes and attacks on the Indian government began the Kashmir insurgency, which during the 1990s escalated into the most important internal security issue in India.\n\nPakistan claims to be giving its \"moral and diplomatic\" support to the separatist movement. The Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan has been accused by India and the international community of supporting, supplying arms and training mujahideen, to fight in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2015, former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf admitted that Pakistan had supported and trained insurgent groups in the 1990s. India has repeatedly called Pakistan to end its \"cross-border terrorism\" in Kashmir. Several new militant groups with radical Islamic views emerged and changed the ideological emphasis of the movement to Islamic. This had happened partly due to a large number of Islamic \"Jihadi\" fighters (mujahadeen) who had entered the Kashmir valley following the end of the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s.\n\nThe conflict between the militants and the Indian forces have led to large number of casualties. Many civilians have also died as a result of being targeted by the various armed groups. According to official figures released in Jammu and Kashmir assembly, there were 3,400 disappearance cases and the conflict has left more than 47,000 people dead which also includes 7,000 police personnel as of July 2009. However, the number of insurgency-related deaths in the state have fallen sharply since the start of a slow-moving peace process between India and Pakistan. Some rights groups claim a higher figure of 100,000 deaths since 1989.\n\nAfter independence from colonial rule India and Pakistan fought a war over the princely state of Kashmir. At the end of the war India controlled the most valuable parts of Kashmir. While there were sporadic periods of violence there was no organised insurgency movement.\n\nDuring this period legislative elections in Jammu and Kashmir were first held in 1951 and Sheikh Abdullah's secular party stood unopposed. He was an instrumental member in the accession of the state to India.\n\nHowever Sheikh Abdullah would fall in and out of favour with the central government and would often be dismissed only to be re-appointed later on. This was a time of political instability & power struggle in Jammu and Kashmir and it went through several periods of President's rule by the Federal Government.\n\nAfter Sheikh Abdullah's death, his son Farooq Abdullah took over as Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Farooq Abdullah eventually fell out of favour with the Central Government and the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had his government toppled with the help of his brother-in-law G. M. Shah. A year later, Abdullah reached an accord with the new Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and announced an alliance with the Congress party for the elections of 1987. The elections were allegedly rigged in favour of Abdullah.\n\nMost commentators state that this led to the rise of an armed insurgency movement composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost the elections. Pakistan supplied these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training.\n\nIn the second half of 1989 the alleged assassinations of the Indian spies and political collaborators by JKLF (Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front) was intensified. Over six months more than a hundred officials were killed to paralyse government's administrative and intelligence apparatus. The daughter of then interior affairs minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was kidnapped in December and four terrorists had to be released for her release. This event led to mass celebrations all over the valley. Farooq Abdullah resigned in January after the appointment of Jagmohan Malhotra as the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, J&K was placed under Governor's Rule under Article 92 of state constitution.\n\nUnder JKLF's leadership on 21–23 January large scale protests were organised in valley. As a response to this largely explosive situation paramilitary units of BSF and CRPF were called. These units were used by the government to combat Maoist insurgency and the North-Eastern insurgency. The challenge to them in this situation was not posed by armed insurgents but by the stone pelters. Their inexperience caused at least 50 casualties in Gawkadal massacre. In this incident the underground militant movement was transformed into a mass struggle. To curb the situation AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) was imposed on Kashmir in September 1990 to suppress the insurgency by giving armed forces the powers to kill and arrest without warrant to maintain public order. During this time the dominant tactic involved killing of a prominent figure in a public gathering to push forces into action and the public prevented them from capturing these insurgents. This sprouting of sympathisers in Kashmir led to the hard-line approach of Indian army.\n\nWith JKLF at forefront large number of militant groups like Allah Tigers, People's League and Hizb-i-Islamia sprung up. Weapons were smuggled on a large scale from Pakistan. In Kashmir JKLF operated under the leadership of Ashfaq Majid Wani, Yasin Bhat, Hamid Shiekh and Javed Mir. To counter this growing pro-Pakistani sentiment in Kashmir, Indian media associated it exclusively with Pakistan.\n\nJKLF used distinctly Islamic themes to mobilise crowds and justify their use of violence. They sought to establish an Islamic democratic state where the rights of minorities would be protected according to Quran and Sunna and economy would be organised on the principles of Islamic socialism.\n\nThe Indian army has conducted various operations to control and eliminate insurgency in the region such as Operation Sarp Vinash, in which a multi-battalion offensive was launched against terrorists from groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami, al-Badr and Jaish-e-Mohammad who had been constructing shelters in the Pir Panjal region of Jammu and Kashmir over several years. The subsequent operations led to the death of over 60 terrorists and uncovered the largest network of militant hideouts in the history of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir covering 100 square kilometers.\n\nDuring the early period of militancy in 1989, multiple militants groups strive to Islamise \"Kashmiri culture\" and \"political setup\" to create a conducive environment for the merger of Kashmir with Pakistan. Numerous Islamist groups were formed in early 1990 who emerged advocating \"Nizam-e-Mustafa (Rule of Muhammad)\" as the objective for their struggle. Militant groups like Hizbul mujahideen and Jamaat-e-Islami asserted that struggle of Kashmir will continue till Islamic Caliphate is achieved in Kashmir. Murder of Kashmiri Hindus, Intellectuals, Liberals and activists were described necessary to get rid of un-Islamic elements. Concurrently all cinema houses, beauty parlours, wine shops, bars, video centres, use of cosmetics and similar things were banned by militant groups. Many militant organisations like \"Al baqr, People's league, Wahdat-e-Islam and Allah Tigers\" imposed restrictions like banning cigarettes, restrictions on Kashmiri girls. Apart from militants, Kashmir was witnessing Islamization during 1980's when Abdullah Government changed the names of about 2,500 villages from their native names to new Islamic names. The Sheikh also started delivering communal speeches in mosques similar to his speeches in the 1930s. Additionally, he referred Kashmiri Pandits as \"mukhbir\" or informers of the Indian government.\n\nBeginning in 2004 Pakistan began to end its support for insurgents in Kashmir. This happened because terrorist groups linked to Kashmir twice tried to assassinate Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf. His successor, Asif Ali Zardari has continued the policy, calling insurgents in Kashmir \"terrorists\". Although it is unclear if Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, thought to be the agency aiding and controlling the insurgency is following Pakistan's commitment to end support for the insurgency in Kashmir.\n\nDespite the change in the nature of the insurgency from a phenomenon supported by external forces to a primarily domestic-driven movement the Indian government has continued to send large numbers of troops to the Indian border.\n\nThere have been widespread protests against the Indian army presence in Kashmir.\n\nOnce the most formidable face of Kashmir militancy, Hizbul Mujahideen is slowly fading away as its remaining commanders and cadres are being taken out on a regular interval by security forces.\nSome minor incidents of grenade throwing and sniper firing at security forces notwithstanding, the situation is under control and more or less peaceful. A record number of tourists including Amarnath pilgrims visited Kashmir during 2012. On 3 August 2012, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba militant commander, Abu Hanzulah involved in various attacks on civilians and security forces was killed in an encounter with security forces in a village in Kupwara district of north Kashmir.\n\nAccording to Indian Army data quoted by Reuters, at least 70 young Kashmiris joined the insurgency in the 2014, army records showed, with most joining the banned group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was accused of carrying out attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai in 2008. Two of the new recruits have doctorates and eight were post graduates, the army data showed. According to BBC, that despite a Pakistani ban on militant activity in Kashmir in 2006, its fighters continue to attempt infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir. These attempts were curtailed however when people living along the Line of Control which divides Indian and Pakistani Kashmir started to hold public protests against the activities of the insurgent groups.\n\nFollowing the rise of Islamisation in the Kashmir valley, during the 1987 state elections, various Islamic anti-establishment groups including Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir were organised under a single banner named Muslim United Front (MUF), that is largely current Hurriyat. MUF's election manifesto stressed the need for a solution to all outstanding issues according to Simla Agreement, work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre. Their slogan was wanting the law of the Quran in the Assembly. But the MUF won only four seats, even though it had polled 31% votes in the election. However, the elections were widely believed to be rigged, changing the course of politics in the state. The insurgency was sparked by the apparent rigging of state elections in 1987.\n\nThe Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence has encouraged and aided the Kashmir independence movement through an insurgency due to its dispute on the legitimacy of Indian rule in Kashmir, with the insurgency as an easy way to keep Indian troops distracted and cause international condemnation of India. \nFormer Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf in Oct 2014 said during TV interview, \"We have source (in Kashmir) besides the (Pakistan) army…People in Kashmir are fighting against (India). We just need to incite them.\"\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in their first ever open acknowledgement in 2011 in US Court, said that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) sponsors terrorism in Kashmir and it oversees terrorist separatist groups in Kashmir.\n\nIn 2019, Pakistani Prime Minister publicly discouraged Pakistani people from going to Kashmir to do \"Jihad\". People who went to Kashmir will do an \"injustice to the Kashmiri people\". Most of the Pakistani militants who had crossed the border over the years and were caught by the Indian security forces were found to belong to the Punjab province of Pakistan.\n\nAfter the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union, Mujahideen fighters, with the aid of Pakistan, slowly infiltrated Kashmir with the goal of spreading a radical Islamist ideology.\n\nJammu and Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in Hindu-majority India. Indian-American journalist Asra Nomani states that while India itself is a secular state, Muslims are politically, culturally and economically marginalised when compared to Hindus in India as a whole. The government's decision to transfer 99 acres of forest land in near Amarnath in the Kashmir valley to a Hindu organisation (for setting up temporary shelters and facilities for Hindu pilgrims) solidified this feeling and led to one of the largest protest rallies in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAfter insurgency started in Kashmir valley because of above reasons in the late 1980s, Indian troops entered in Kashmir valley to control the insurgency. Some analysts have suggested that the number of Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir is close to 600,000 although estimates vary and the Indian government refuses to release official figures. The troops have been accused and held accountable for several humanitarian abuses and have engaged in mass extrajudicial killings, torture, rape and sexual abuse.\n\nIndian security forces have been implicated in many reports for enforced disappearances of thousands of Kashmiris whereas the security forces deny having their information and/or custody. This is often in association with torture or extrajudicial killing. Human right activists estimate the number of disappeared to be over eight thousand, last seen in government detention. The disappeared are believed to be dumped in thousands of mass graves across Kashmir. A State Human Rights Commission inquiry in 2011, has confirmed there are thousands of bullet-ridden bodies buried in unmarked graves in Jammu and Kashmir. Of the 2730 bodies uncovered in 4 of the 14 districts, 574 bodies were identified as missing locals in contrast to the Indian governments insistence that all the graves belong to foreign militants.\n\nMilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir operate under impunity and emergency powers granted to them by the central government. These powers allow the military to curtail civil liberties, creating further support for the insurgency.\n\nThe insurgents have also abused human rights, driving Kashmiri Pandits away from the valley of Kashmir, an action regarded as ethnic cleansing The government's inability to protect the people from both its own troops and the insurgency has further eroded support for the government.\n\nAmnesty International accused security forces of exploiting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) that enables them to \"hold prisoners without trial\". The group argues that the law, which allows security to detain individuals for as many as two years \"without presenting charges, violating prisoners' human rights\". The Army sources maintain that \"any move to revoke AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir would be detrimental to the security of the Valley and would provide a boost to the terrorists.\"\n\nFormer Indian Army Chief General V. K. Singh rejected the accusations that the action was not taken in the cases of human rights violations by Army personnel. On 24 October 2010, he has said that 104 Army personnel had been punished in Jammu and Kashmir in this regard, including 39 officers. He also said that 95% of the allegations of human rights abuses against Indian Army were proved to be false, of which he remarked, had apparently been made with the \"ulterior motive of maligning the armed forces\". However, according to Human Rights Watch, the military courts in India, in general, were proved to be incompetent to deal with cases of serious human rights abuses and were responsible in covering up evidence and protecting the involved officers. Amnesty International in its report in 2015, titled \"\"Denied\"-Failures in Accountability in Jammu and Kashmir\", says, \"...with respect to investigations, an inquiry that is conducted by the same authority accused of the crime raises serious questions about the independence and impartiality of those proceedings\", adding that according to the international law, an independent authority that is not involved in the alleged violations has to investigate such crimes.\n\nThese human rights violations are said to have contributed to the rise of resistance in Kashmir.\n\nPsychologist Waheeda Khan, explaining the rebellious nature of the Kashmiris, says that because of the tense situations in the valley from the 1990s, the generation gap between parents and young generations has increased. Young generations tend to blame their parents for failing to do anything about the political situation. So they start experimenting with their own aggressive ways to show their curbed feelings and would go against any authority. A prominent psychiatrist of the valley, Margoob, described that children/teenagers are much more vulnerable to passionate actions and reactions, since the young minds are yet to completely develop psychological mechanisms. When they assume that they are \"pushed against the wall\", they get controlled by the emotions without bothering about the consequences. Also young people easily identify themselves with the \"group\" rather than with their individual identities. It leads to psychological distress which causes antisocial behaviour and aggressive attitude. Often, this situation gets worsened by the availability of weapons and people becoming familiar to violence after having exposed to conflict for so long. Waheeda Khan remarks, the major concern is that generations of children who are experiencing long-term violence in their lives, may reach adulthood perceiving that violence is a fair means of solving ethinic, religious, or political differences.\n\nHigh unemployment and lack of economic opportunities in Kashmir are also said to have intensified the struggle.\n\nSince the 2008 protests and 2010 unrest, the turmoil has taken a new dimension when people, particularly youngsters of the Kashmir valley have started pelting stones on security forces to express their aggression and protest for the loss of freedom. In turn they get attacked by the armed personnel with pellets, rubber bullets, sling shots and tear gas shells. This leads to eye-injuries and several other kind of injuries to many people. Security forces also face injuries, and sometimes get beaten up during these events. According to Waheeda Khan, most of the 'stone-pelters' are school and college going students. Large number of these people get arrested during these events for allegedly resorting to stone pelting, after which some of them are also tortured. According to political activist Mannan Bukhari, Kashmiris made stone, an easily accessible and defenseless weapon, their weapon of choice for protest.\n\nKashmiri senior journalist Parvaiz Bukhari remarked:The summer of 2010 witnessed a convulsion in the world’s most militarized zone, the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, an unprecedented and deadly civil unrest that is beginning to change a few things on the ground. [...] Little known and relatively anonymous resistance activists emerged, organizing an unarmed agitation more fierce than the armed rebellion against Indian rule two decades earlier. And apparently aware of the post 9/11 world, young Kashmiris, children of the conflict, made stones and rocks a weapon of choice against government armed forces, side-stepping the tag of a terrorist movement linked with Pakistan. The unrest represents a conscious transition to an unarmed mass movement, one that poses a moral challenge to New Delhi’s military domination over the region.\n\n\"Further information: Human rights abuses by insurgents, Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir and Rape by militants\"\n\nIslamic separatist militants are accused of violence against the Kashmir populace. . On the other hand , Indian army has also committed serious crimes like using pellet guns, torture , killing and rape etc . The militants have kidnapped and killed many civil servants and suspected informers. Tens of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits have emigrated as a result of the violence. Estimates of the displaced varies from 170,000 to 700,000. Thousands of Kasmiri Pandits had to move to Jammu because of militancy.\n\n\nOver time the Indian government has increasingly relied on military presence to control the insurgency. The military has allegedly committed human rights violations. The government would often dissolve assemblies, arrest elected politicians and impose president's rule. The government also rigged elections in 1987. In recent times there have been signs that the government is taking local elections more seriously. The government has also funneled development aid to Kashmir and Kashmir has now become the biggest per capita receiver of Federal aid.\n\nThe Pakistani central government originally supported, trained and armed the insurgency in Kashmir, sometimes known as \"ultras\" (extremists), however after groups linked to the Kashmiri insurgency twice attempted to assassinate president Pervez Musharraf, Musharraf decided to end support for such groups. His successor, Asif Ali Zardari has continued the policy, calling insurgents in Kashmir \"terrorists\".\n\nBut the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence hasn't followed the lead of the government and has continued its support for insurgent groups in Kashmir In 2008, 541 people died due to insurgency, \"The Economist\" called it the lowest in two decades. The report cited a reduction in the support for militants by Pakistan and war fatigue among the Kashmiris as the reasons for the reduction in casualty figures.\n\nSince around 2000 the 'insurgency' has become far less violent and has instead taken on the form of protests and marches. Certain groups have also chosen to lay down their arms and look for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nThe different insurgent groups have different aims in Kashmir. Some want complete independence from both India and Pakistan, others want unification with Pakistan and still others just want greater autonomy from the Indian government.\n\nA 2010 survey found that 43% of the people in J&K and 44% of the people in AJK would favour complete independence from both India and Pakistan, with support for the independence movement unevenly distributed across the region.\n\nOver the last two years, the militant group, Lashkar-e-Toiba has split into two factions: \"Al Mansurin\" and \"Al Nasirin\". Another new group reported to have emerged is the \"Save Kashmir Movement\". Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (formerly known as Harkat-ul-Ansar) and Lashkar-e-Toiba are believed to be operating from Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir and Muridke, Pakistan respectively. \n\nOther less well known groups are the Freedom Force and Farzandan-e-Milat. A smaller group, Al-Badr, has been active in Kashmir for many years and is still believed to be functioning. All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an organisation that uses moderate means to press for the rights of the Kashmiris, is often considered as the \"mediator\" between New Delhi and insurgent groups. \n\nIt is unclear if Al Qaeda has a presence in Jammu and Kashmir. Donald Rumsfeld suggested that they were active and in 2002 the SAS hunted for Osama bin Laden in Jammu and Kashmir. Al Qaeda claims that it has established a base in Jammu and Kashmir. However, there has been no evidence for any of these assertions. The Indian army also claims that there is no evidence of Al Qaeda presence in Jammu and Kashmir. Al Qaeda has established bases in Pakistani administered Kashmir and some, including Robert Gates have suggested that they have helped to plan attacks in India.\n\nAccording to Sumantra Bose in his book, \"Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace\", around 40000 (Indian estimates) to 80000 (Hurriyat estimates) civilians, separatist guerilla fighters and Indian security personnel died from the time period of 1989 to 2002 in both Kashmir Valley and Jammu . More than 4600 security personnel, 13500 civilians and 15937 militants including 3000 from outside Jammu and Kashmir (mostly Pakistanis and some Afghans) were killed in this fourteen-year period. Also in this period, 55,538 incidents of violence were recorded. Indian forces engaged in counter insurgency operations captured around 40,000 firearms, 150,000 explosive devices, and over 6 million rounds of assorted ammunition. Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society posits a figure of 70,000 deaths, most of them civilians.\n\n"}

The album failed to chart, and \"Nightwalkin\"' was the only album released on RCA.\n\nAlisha prepped for a comeback in 1990, signing a new deal with MCA Records and began working on her third album. MCA's president at the time asked producer Michael Jay (who had produced and co-written \"Toy Soldiers\" by Martika) if he would work with Alisha on what would become \"Bounce Back\". Jay agreed and went on to produce the entire record. The title track \"Bounce Back\" was released as the lead single and reached No. 10 on the Hot Dance charts and No. 54 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in June 1990. The follow up single \"Wrong Number\" failed to chart, and the album peaked at No. 166 on the Billboard Top 200.\n\nAfter taking a break from releasing music, Alisha recorded and released the single \"Wherever The Rhythm Takes Me\" on Critique Records. The song, written by Michael Jay and produced by Chris Barbosa, was released on CD and 12\" vinyl in September 1996. In November 1999, she released the single \"You Wanna Be A Star (Superstar)\", produced by Jellybean Benitez and Soul Solution, on Jellybean Recordings, the title song for the Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon movie \"Superstar\". Although not officially released, Alisha re-recorded her first single \"All Night Passion\" in 2004 with an updated, Hi-NRG production.\n\n"}

Cascading is used to create and execute complex data processing workflows on a Hadoop cluster using any JVM-based language (Java, JRuby, Clojure, etc.), hiding the underlying complexity of MapReduce jobs. It is open source and available under the Apache License. Commercial support is available from Driven, Inc.\n\nCascading was originally authored by Chris Wensel, who later founded Concurrent, Inc, which has been re-branded as Driven. Cascading is being actively developed by the community and a number of add-on modules are available.\n\nTo use Cascading, Apache Hadoop must also be installed, and the Hadoop job .jar must contain the Cascading .jars. Cascading consists of a data processing API, integration API, process planner and process scheduler.\n\nCascading leverages the scalability of Hadoop but abstracts standard data processing operations away from underlying map and reduce tasks. Developers use Cascading to create a .jar file that describes the required processes. It follows a ‘source-pipe-sink’ paradigm, where data is captured from sources, follows reusable ‘pipes’ that perform data analysis processes, where the results are stored in output files or ‘sinks’. Pipes are created independent from the data they will process. Once tied to data sources and sinks, it is called a ‘flow’. These flows can be grouped into a ‘cascade’, and the process scheduler will ensure a given flow does not execute until all its dependencies are satisfied. Pipes and flows can be reused and reordered to support different business needs.\n\nDevelopers write the code in a JVM-based language and do not need to learn MapReduce. The resulting program can be regression tested and integrated with external applications like any other Java application.\n\nCascading is most often used for ad targeting, log file analysis, bioinformatics, machine learning, predictive analytics, web content mining, and extract, transform and load (ETL) applications.\n\nCascading was cited as one of the top five most powerful Hadoop projects by SD Times in 2011, as a major open source project relevant to bioinformatics and is included in Hadoop: A Definitive Guide, by Tom White. The project has also been cited in presentations, conference proceedings and Hadoop user group meetings as a useful tool for working with Hadoop and with Apache Spark\n\n\n\n"}

There were also several spin-offs, including \"The Unicorn Club\" and \"Sweet Valley University.\" Although most of these books were published in the 1980s and 1990s, they remained so popular that several titles have been re-released in recent years.\n\nFrancine Rubin was born in Manhattan, New York and raised in Queens, New York, United States. Her father was an auctioneer. In 1958, she graduated from New York University. It was there that she first met author and journalist John Pascal and, in 1965, they were married. Francine often credited John as her writing mentor, and they collaborated on several projects, including writing scripts for the ABC soap opera \"The Young Marrieds,\" which aired from 1964 to 1966 as part of the ABC Daytime block. John died of lung cancer in 1981, at 49 years of age.\n\nFrancine's brother was the prolific Broadway playwright and librettist Michael Stewart, who wrote the books to such musical hits as \"Bye Bye Birdie\" and \"Hello, Dolly!\" Francine, her husband John, and her brother Michael worked together writing the book to the Broadway musical \"George M!\", which ran at the Palace Theatre from 1968 to 1970. A television version of \"George M!\" was aired on NBC in 1970. Following her brother's death in 1987, Ms. Pascal revised his musical \"Mack & Mabel.\" She also worked on the revision of another of his musicals, \"Carnival!\", for the Kennedy Center in Washington.\n\nPascal's first young adult novel, published in 1977, was called \"Hangin' Out with Cici,\" in which her heroine, Victoria Martin, went back in time and met her mother as a teenager. It was televised as an ABC Afterschool Special, \"My Mother Was Never a Kid.\" She has written two other books about Victoria Martin; these were \"My First Love and Other Disasters\" and \"Love and Betrayal & Hold the Mayo.\" Another of her early novels, \"The Hand-Me-Down Kid,\" was also made into an ABC Afterschool Special.\n\nMore recent works include the Caitlin series, a set of three trilogies which follows a teenage girl into adulthood, as well as a second mass-market project, the young adult fantasy spy series \"Fearless\" and its spin-off \"Fearless: FBI.\" A TV series was also planned for \"Fearless,\" but for several reasons it never aired.\n\nAnother of Pascal's novels, \"The Ruling Class,\" a teen novel about a clique of spectacularly cruel girls who essentially run a high school in a wealthy Dallas suburb, has been described as \"a magnetic \"tour de force\" created by a master storyteller at the top of her form.\" In 1994, her Sweet Valley High book series was adapted for television with her brought aboard as \"executive producer\" and \"creative consultant\". None of her suggestions were really accepted and she has since disowned the show.\n\nIn addition to her work for mostly female teens, Ms. Pascal has written some adult fiction books, including \"La Villa\" (originally published as \"If Wishes Were Horses\") and \"Save Johanna!\", as well as a non-fiction book, \"The Strange Case of Patty Hearst,\" on which she collaborated with her husband John. \"Sweet Valley Confidential: Ten Years Later\" revisited the \"Sweet Valley High\" characters ten years later, by which time they had become adults. The adult story continues with \"The Sweet Life,\" a series of e-books taking place three years after \"Sweet Valley Confidential.\"\n\nOn February 22, 2008, Pascal's oldest daughter Jamie died after a two-year battle with liver disease.\n\nAs of the last days of June 2015, Pascal was dividing her time between homes in New York and the south of France. She maintains a rigorous professional schedule, but spends as much time as she can with her children and grandchildren. Since John died, she has never remarried. Her daughter Susan now lives in Shanghai, with her daughter Nicole.\n\nMs. Pascal received The Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award, The Milner Award, The Bernard Versele Award, Brussels, and Publishers Weekly Literary Prize.\n\n\n"}

It stars Karen Black, Rainbow Harvest, Yvonne De Carlo and William Sanderson. The film follows a teenage outcast who finds herself drawn to an antique mirror left in the house she and her mother have moved into. A soundtrack for \"Mirror, Mirror\" was released in 1990 through Orphan Records.\n\nIn 1950s Iowa, Mary Weatherford sacrifices her sister Elizabeth in front of a large mirror, stabbing her to death on a bed. Decades later, Megan Gordon, a shy teenage goth, moves into the home from Los Angeles with her recently widowed mother, Susan. In her new bedroom, Megan finds the large mirror in the corner left behind by the previous owners. Emelin, the auctioneer in charge of the house clearance, finds a cache of journals that describe the mirror's apparent possession by a demonic force able to grant wishes.\n\nAt her new school, Megan is taunted mercilessly by her peers, apart from the friendly Nikki as well as handsome, athletic Ron. Charleen, a bully running for class president against Nikki, quickly targets Megan. Meanwhile, as Megan becomes drawn to the mirror in her room, she's plagued by bizarre incidents at home; her mother's dog mysteriously dies, she's visited by a gruesome apparition of her dead father, and the mirror begins inexplicably dripping blood. Megan becomes convinced that the mirror is responsible for a series of misfortunes involving those around her, including Charleen experiencing a massive nosebleed in the cafeteria, and her teacher, Mr. Anderson, having a severe asthma attack during class.\n\nRealizing the mirror's powers, Megan begins harnessing them herself, using them to manipulate Jeff, Charleen's love interest, into developing a crush on her instead. When Jeff stops a sexual encounter, the demon in the mirror brutally murders him before making his body disappear. The next day, Emelin attempts to retrieve the mirror from the house while Megan and Susan are gone, but her hands are mysteriously impaled, leading her to flee. When Nikki loses the student council race to Charleen, Megan harnesses the mirror's powers to scald Charleen to death in the girls' locker room showers, before killing Charleen's friend Kim in a bathroom.\n\nNikki becomes discomforted by Megan's change in personality, and is disturbed when Megan suggests she \"helped\" her usurp the class presidency. Nikki meets with Mrs. Perfili, the local real estate agent, and Emelin to inquire about the history of Megan's house and the mirror. Emelin reveals the content of the journals to Nikki, and explains that Mary Weatherford sacrificed her sister in front of the mirror decades ago hoping to appease it. After Nikki leaves, Emelin is impaled to death with a shard of glass at her antiques store.\n\nThat night, Ron is attacked by a doppelgänger of Nikki in his house and brutally murdered. After finding Ron's body, Nikki receives a phone call from Megan asking her to come to her house. Meanwhile, Susan has her hand mangled in the garbage disposal in the kitchen and bleeds to death, leading Megan to turn against the mirror. Nikki arrives armed with a dagger and attempts to shatter the mirror, but it is resistant. She and Megan attempt to flee as a torrent of wind fills the house, but are unable to escape. Megan sacrifices herself to the mirror, thus ending its reign of terror. Nikki invokes the mirror, begging it to restore things back to how they were before. She awakens in the room on the bed, dagger in hand, with Megan's corpse beneath her, in the same position as Mary Weatherford, having been subjected to an apparent time loop. The demon shows itself in the mirror before retreating, and Nikki fearfully covers it with a sheet.\n\nThe film (initially titled \"The Black Glass\") was shot in Los Angeles, and Zelda Rubenstein was originally slated to make an appearance in the film. The cast and crew were approximately sixty-percent female. The film's production company, Orphan Eyes, was based in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Mirror, Mirror\" screened theatrically at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1990, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 31 that year, opening first in Detroit. It also screened at the Chicago International Film Festival on October 19, 1990.\n\nOverall reception for the film has been mixed to positive, with Entertainment Weekly giving \"Mirror, Mirror\" a \"B-\" rating. In his book \"Generation Multiplex\", Timothy Shary called \"Mirror, Mirror\" \"one of the best teen horror films in general\" and citing it as an example of \"the tyranny of teen popularity.\" \"Creature Features\" panned the film, giving it two stars and criticizing it as a \"compendium of cliches.\"\n\nA soundtrack for \"Mirror, Mirror\" was released on CD through Orphan Records in 1990. Jimmy Lifton composed and performed the movie's orchestral tracts, with the movie also featuring songs by Scott Campbell, Jim Walker, and Gene Evaro.\n\nThe film was released on DVD on October 28, 2000 by Anchor Bay Entertainment. On March 6, 2004, it was re-released as part of a four-film set featuring the film's three sequels, called the \"Mirror, Mirror Collection,\" also by Anchor Bay. The set was packaged in a reflective foil case. Both releases are out of print.\n\n\"Mirror, Mirror\" was followed by three sequels, \"\" (1994), \"\" (1995), and \"Mirror, Mirror IV: Reflection\" (2000). Reception for the sequels was largely negative, with the Orlando Sentinel criticizing \"Raven Dance\" as \"reflect[ing] poorly on [the] classic original\". William Sanderson was the only actor from the first film to return for the second movie, albeit in a different role. The second film notably featured an early film appearance for Mark Ruffalo.\n\n\n"}

Half of the area falls under the greater “Historic Core” of Downtown Los Angeles, which spans between Hill and Main Streets, and 3rd and 9th streets. The median year in which the buildings in the area were built was 1923. The oldest building to remain in the district is located on 543 South Broadway Avenue - a three story, 32,600 square foot commercial space that is now occupied by Teresa’s Bridals. Two of the earliest jewelers to establish stores in 1932 were the Laykin Diamond Company (Laykin et Cie) and Harry Winston & Co. Both stores were housed at the historic Alexandria Hotel on 5th street, just behind the district on S. Broadway.\n\nAlmost all of the buildings within the Jewelry District were designed for general office use with retail spaces on the street level, with some large venues, such as the historic Loew’s State Theatre on 703 S. Broadway, which was built in 1923. In the early twentieth-century, downtown was rapidly developing but it did not feature skyscrapers as tall as Chicago and New York. The buildings were limited to 150 feet by law, which was favored by architects and planners who saw the towering skyscrapers of the east coast metropolises as unsustainable and not conducive to the Southern California lifestyle. Although many residents were living in apartment buildings at the time, the architects and planners argued that excessive vertical expansion would lead to inhumane overconcentration and congestion.\n\nThe influx of jewelry stores in the area did not come about until after the 1960s when gold came to be seen as a safer investment than U.S. dollars. Before this surge, the California Jewelry Mart dominated the local industry with its establishment on S. 607 Hill Street. The district became even more popular with the opening of Saint Vincent Jewelry Center, which is still housed in a large 1923 building complex with a European-inspired alley of restaurants. Across the street from St. Vincent’s is the State Theater Building, a twelve-story red brick office building and theater, designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Day in 1921. Right across Loew’s Theatre was another office building which accommodated a drug store in the early 20th century. Behind Loews, along 7th street, is the Speckels building – an office building turned garment manufacturing center – and the Provident Loan Association, a not-for-profit organization that provided short term loans for gold and jewelry. It was the last remaining of the many not-for-profit loan societies of the late 19th and early 20th century. Another building on 728 S. Hill Street is the Jasper building, a 14-story office Italianate building built in 1928, which was converted to accommodate another jewelry manufacturing center. One particular historic site in process of restoration is Clifton’s Cafeteria on 648 South Broadway, whose original 1904 façade has been restored after 50 years of a grate-like, modern aluminum covering. This 1963 remodeling effort was an attempt to compete with the newer restaurants in the city suburbs. It was once home to Boos Brothers Cafeteria until Clifton purchased the lease in 1935.\n\nThe Los Angeles Jewelry District can be accessed by public transportation through the Red Line to Pershing Square station. The district is southeast of the square.\n"}

MS-DOS and Macintosh computer ports were later released. A major selling point for the game was the \"mature\" content of the full motion video sequences, with a number of simulated sex scenes.\n\nThe player takes on the role of a private investigator hired by a member of the wealthy Hawke family in order to gain enough evidence to bring down the corrupt Reed Hawke (played by Robert Culp), CEO of Hawke Industries. Hawke has gathered his family together for the weekend to prepare for his announcement that he will be running for President of the United States. The player controls a video camera located in a building opposite to spy on the Hawke family home in an effort to gather enough evidence to destroy Reed Hawke's career. The player character's client is randomly selected each time a new game is started, and the storyline also changes according to the player's actions.\n\nThe design of Voyeur was inspired by the Alfred Hitchcock film “Rear Window” starring Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. In the film, Jimmy Steward looks into the rear windows of a building across the interior courtyard from his apartment. He is able to see only some of what is going on in the apartments. He has to imagine the rest. He eventually thinks a murder has been committed in one of the apartments. In his effort to get evidence on the murderer he puts himself and Grace Kelly in mortal danger.\n\nThis dramatic device was the basis for the design of Voyeur. The player can only see partial scenes playing in the windows of the Reed Hawke mansion at any point in time in the narrative. They must decide what is happening and what they want to do about it based on this partial information. The design also makes use of a ticking clock. Scenes appear in the windows of the Hawke mansion only for a brief period of time. If the player misses any of them or chooses to look at something else, their sense of what is going on could be incomplete. The player has the weekend to stop the nomination of Reed Hawke for president. If they guess wrong about which member of the family is betraying Hawke, the player is killed by an assassin. \n\nA sequel was released for PC and Macintosh entitled \"Voyeur II\", and a finished beta version of the sequel for Philips CD-I has been discovered and distributed on various abandonware sites.\n\nReviewing the Macintosh version, a \"Next Generation\" critic remarked derisively on the limited interactivity of full motion video based games, but said that \"Voyeur\" is a superior game by the standards of its genre due to the solid acting. He gave it two out of five stars.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the CD-i version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Although it won't appeal to action fans, this title has enough depth and replay value to be a valuable addition to any CD-i library.\"\n\n"}

He batted and threw right-handed.\n\nA bright prospect, Busby won 56 games in his first three full seasons, only to have his career derailed by a rotator cuff tear. Drafted by the Royals in in the second round, the University of Southern California graduate made his debut the following season and stuck in the major leagues for good in , when he won 16 games and on April 27 pitched the first no-hitter in Kansas City Royals history, defeating the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium 3-0 on April 27. Busby became the first no-hit pitcher who did not come to bat during the entire game, with the American League having adopted the designated hitter rule that year.\n\nIn a game against the California Angels on September 20, 1972, Busby hit a grand slam only to have it taken back by the first base umpire John Rice who said time out had been called to eject Jerry May. Nonetheless, Busby went on to hit a double and two singles in the game, while also earning the victory on the mound.\n\nIn , Busby enjoyed his best season, winning 22 games and making the American League All-Star team. He also pitched a second no-hitter on June 19, this one against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium. Yielding only a second-inning walk to George Scott, Busby defeated the Brewers 2-0, besting Clyde Wright—himself a no-hit pitcher in 1970. With this no-hitter, Busby became the first pitcher in major-league history to throw no-hitters in each of his first two complete seasons. In he won 18 games and made the All-Star team again.\n\nBusby had struggled with his control early in his career, but his problems returned to a greater degree in when he was diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff; an injury that at the time ended a pitcher's career. Busby subsequently became the first baseball player to undergo rotator cuff surgery. In an effort to help his arm recover from the surgery, his doctor recommended that Busby be placed on a pitch count. He is often believed to be the first baseball player to be placed on a pitch count, something that Busby has stated is a myth. Before his injury, he is alleged to have thrown close to 200 pitches in a game, which Busby also says is untrue.\n\nUnfortunately for Busby, the surgery did not save his career. After missing the entire season and most of , he pitched in 22 games (including 12 starts) the next year, compiling a respectable 6-6 record with a 3.63 ERA, but his walks outnumbered his strikeouts (64-to-45). In he even pitched a one-hitter, but otherwise pitched ineffectively, compiling a 6.17 ERA and allowing 80 baserunners in 42.1 innings. He pitched his final game on August 26 and the Royals released him three days later. Busby signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals before the season, but never pitched in the major leagues again.\n\nIn an eight-year career, Busby posted a 70-54 record with 659 strikeouts and a 3.72 ERA in 1060.2 innings.\n\nDespite the brevity of his career, Busby was among the first two players elected to the Royals Hall of Fame. Outfielder Amos Otis was the other. In 2009 he was elected to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. His 70 career victories ranks him ninth on the Royals' all-time list.\n\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Busby became a sportscaster, primarily for the Texas Rangers, and has also worked as an instructor at a baseball school. Unlike most former players, Busby acts as both a play-by-play man and a color commentator, and traded positions with Eric Nadel on radio broadcasts. After replacing Dave Barnett as television play-by-play announcer in the middle of the 2012 season, Busby had been working exclusively on play-by-play, with Tom Grieve on color. However, in October 2016, the Rangers announced that Busby would not be returning for the 2017 season. Dave Raymond has replaced Busby for the 2017 season.\n\n"}

He also formed a tag team with Dusty Rhodes, and they won the NWA World tag team title from Ivan Koloff and Don Kernodle. They feuded with them and Ivan's \"nephew\" Nikita Koloff until losing the title to the Koloffs in early 1985.\n\nFernandez soon became involved in a feud with Arn Anderson after being attacked by Anderson and laid out. He teamed with Thunderbolt Patterson to feud with Arn and Ole Anderson.\n\nIn late 1985, he started helping Jimmy Valiant in his war against Paul Jones and his \"Army\". He formed a team with Valiant called the \"B and B Connection\" (\"Boogie Woogie\" and \"Bull\"). He had some matches against Abdullah the Butcher and The Barbarian. He also formed a tag team with Hector Guerrero in 1986 called The Latin Connection. In the summer of 1986, Fernandez accepted Jones' money and turned on Valiant starting a feud between the two. Later in the year, Jones also brought in Rick Rude. Pairing Fernandez and Rude together, the duo defeated The Rock 'n' Roll Express for the NWA World tag team title. They feuded with the Express and kept the titles until June 1987 when Rude left the promotion, which was resolved with a \"phantom title change\". Fernandez & Chavo Guerrero came to CWA in Memphis in 1987.\n\nFernandez teamed with Ivan Koloff for the rest of the summer and left for the Mid-Southern promotion in late 1987. He was soon in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) feuding with Wahoo McDaniel after he attacked Wahoo and destroyed his headdress. The two veterans, who had feuded briefly in the NWA, engaged in an \"Indian Strap match\" at the AWA pay-per-view Super Clash III. After that feud ended in late 1988, Fernandez headed to Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council (WWC) where he stayed through 1991 and then he headed to the independent circuit. Fernandez sparked controversy in the WWC in 1989 when he wrestled Invader #3. During the match, Fernandez landed a knee drop off the top rope to Invader #3's midsection; the impact apparently ruptured Invader #3's stomach cavity, causing him to vomit blood all over the ring while Fernandez landed two more knee drops. There have been debates on whether Invader #3's injury was a work, with some theorizing that the incident came about due to real life bad blood between Fernandez and Jose Gonzalez, the booker of WWC who was acquitted of murdering Bruiser Brody earlier that year. Others say the blood was a combination of pig's blood and vodka. In an interview with Bill Apter, Fernandez stated that it was not a work and was done deliberately as an act of vengeance for the death of Brody.\n\n\n"}

Twiss\n\nRichard Quintin Twiss (24 August 1920 – 20 May 2005) was a British astronomer. He is known for his work on the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect with Robert Hanbury Brown. It led to the development of the Hanbury Brown-Twiss intensity interferometer in the UK in 1954. Their work appeared to contradict the established beliefs about quantum interference, and he and Brown received the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for it in 1968.\n\nRichard Twiss was born in Simla in India but was educated in England. He read mathematics at Cambridge, completing the Mathematical Tripos with distinction, but his early contributions were to the theory of radar and basic electronics. His work in this area was\nincluded in the famous \"five foot shelf\"—a series of reference books in electronic engineering compiled at MIT that was the circuit designer's bible in the 1950s. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by MIT in 1949.\n\nTwiss went on to help construct the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. Observations with the interferometer began in 1965. Measurements made between 1965 and 1974 were used to establish the temperature scale for stars hotter than the Sun and this scale is still in use.\n\nThe intensity interferometer has a very poor signal-to-noise ratio compared to the classical \"Michelson\" stellar interferometer. Twiss decided to pursue the Michelson alternative at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington in the UK. John Davis worked with him for a short while on this project.\n\nWhen the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh established its outstation at Monte Porzio Catone just south of Rome, Twiss decided to move his Michelson interferometer there.

Page, whose real name is Teddy Chiu, began his career as a young man in the early 1980s, directing low-budget action movies for producer K.Y. Lim's Silver Star Film Company (known as Kinavesa in the Philippines). \n\nMost of them starred the same prolific group of European and American expatriate actors working in the Philippines in the 1980s: Mike Monty, Bruce Baron, Romano Kristoff, James Gaines, Eric Hahn, Mike Cohen, Ann Milhench, Gwendolyn Hung, Ronnie Patterson and Ken Watanabe (not to be confused with the Japanese actor of the same name). \n\nFormer Spaghetti Western and peplum star, Richard Harrison, appeared in three of Page's films, \"Fireback\", \"Hunter's Crossing\" and \"Blood Debts\" (1983). Many of his earlier efforts were written or co-written by Watanabe, Kristoff, Gaines or Harrison using a pseudonym. The majority of Page's films have been generally classified as Z-movies, characterized by loose, seemingly improvised narrative (\"Fireback\", for example, is supposed to take place in the United States, but the setting suddenly changes to \"\"The Jungle\"\" for the last third of the film), bizarre plot twists, and comically bad acting accentuated by equally poor dubbing. Gratuitous, often sadistic violence is mixed with near childlike naivety, with characters having comic book names like \"Panther\" and \"Cat Burglar\". Another trademark of the earlier Page films were oversized, customized special weapons, which feature prominently in \"Fireback\" and \"Blood Debts\". \n\nThe \"Silver Star\" productions are infamous for their extremely low budgets, which might have also contributed to the low technical quality. In the book \"Gods In Spandex\", Richard Harrison states that the Page films he appeared in didn't have complete shooting scripts and many scenes were improvised, hence the disjointed narrative. However, it can be said that Page's early films are particularly bad, even on the admittedly low \"Silver Star\" standards, but they have attracted some cult interest, especially in French B-movie fandom.\n\nThere is very little information on Teddy Page in print or online. He is discussed briefly in pieces by Richard Harrison and John P. Dulaney in the books \"Gods in Polyester, Or, A Survivors' Account of 70's Cinema Obscura\" (2004) and \"Gods In Spandex, Or, A Survivors' Account of 80's Cinema Obscura\" (2007). He is also mentioned in passing in interviews of Bruce Baron, Nick Nicholson and Mike Monty at the French B-movie website \"Nanarland\". \n\nHe is still working as a director on films and television in the Philippines, now using his real name (Teddy Chiu). His last directing credit is the 1999 action film \"Anino\". He has also worked as a Second Unit Director or assistant director, most recently in the 2001 film \"Xtreme Warriors\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1915344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915344", "title": "Glad (duke)", "text": "Glad (duke)\n\nGlad (, , , ) was the ruler of Banat (in present-day Romania and Serbia) at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 900 AD, according to the \"Gesta Hungarorum\". The \"Gesta\", which was written by an author known in modern scholarship as Anonymus in the second half of the 12th century or in the early 13th century, is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. The \"Gesta\" did not refer to the enemies of the conquering Hungarians (or Magyars), who had been mentioned in earlier annals and chronicles, but wrote of a dozen persons, including Glad, who are unknown from other primary sources of the Hungarian Conquest. Therefore, modern historians debate whether Glad was an actual enemy of the conquerors or only a \"fictitious person\" made up by Anonymus. In Romanian historiography, Glad is described as one of the three Romanian dukes who ruled a historical region of present-day Romania in the early 10th century.\n\nAccording to the \"Gesta\", Glad came from Vidin in Bulgaria. He occupied Banat with the assistance of \"Cumans\" before the arrival of the Magyars. Anonymus wrote that Cumans, Bulgarians, and Vlachs (or Romanians), supported Glad against the invading Magyars, but the latter annihilated their united army in a battle near the Timiș River. The \"Gesta\" presents Ahtum, who ruled Banat in the early 11th century, according to the longer version of the \"Life of St Gerard\", as Glad's descendant.\n\nThe earliest record of the Magyars (or Hungarians) is connected to their alliance with the Bulgars against a group of Byzantine prisoners who were planning to cross the Lower Danube in an attempt to return to their homeland around 837 AD. They dwelled in the steppes north and northwest of the Black Sea. A group of rebellious subjects of the Khazar Khaganate, known as Kabars, joined them, \naccording to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. The \"Annals of St. Bertin\" states that the Magyars launched their first military expedition against the Carolingian Empire in 861.\n\nThe Magyars invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Empire in 894. In retaliation, the Bulgars entered into an alliance with the Pechenegs. They jointly invaded the Magyars' lands, forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and cross the Carpathian Mountains in search of a new homeland. In the Carpathian Basin, the Magyars \"roamed in the wildernesses of the Pannonians and Avars\" before attacking \"the lands of the Carinthians, Moravians and Bulgars\", according to the contemporaneous Regino of Prüm.\n\nThe Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin is the principal subject of the \"Gesta Hungarorum\", which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. Most scholars agree that a notary of Béla III of Hungary, who ruled between 1173 and 1196, wrote the \"Gesta\" after the king's death. According to an alternative theory, the author of the \"Gesta\", who is now known as Anonymus, had served Béla II of Hungary before starting to complete his work around 1150. Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia and the invading Magyars' other opponents who had been mentioned in works written in earlier centuries. Neither did he refer to the Magyars' fights with the Moravians, Franks and Bavarians which had been described in earlier annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus wrote of local polities and rulersincluding Gelou, the Vlach duke of Transylvania, Menumorut, the lord of the regions between the rivers Mureș, Someș and Tisza, and Salanus, the Bulgar ruler of the lands between the Danube and the Tiszaunknown from other primary sources.\n\nStirrups, horse bits and spear points from inhumation graves unearthed at Sânpetru German suggest that the Avars settled along the Mureș River in Banat soon after their conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 560s. However, most archaeological finds in the lands south of the Mureș that had been attributed to the Avars are dated to the \"Late Avar\" period. Written sources show the survival of Gepids under Avar rule in the wider region of the Timiș River. For instance, the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of \"three Gepid settlements\" which were destroyed by an invading Byzantine army in 599 or 600. A rich burial yielding weapons unearthed at Pančevo and the Treasure of Sânnicolau Mare show that an important center of power existed in Banat in the \"Late Avar\" period, according to archaeologist Florin Curta. However, \"Late Avar\" cemeteries did not survive the 8th century.\n\nThe Franks launched a series of expeditions against the Avar Khaganate in 790s, causing its disintegration. Krum of Bulgaria, who reigned between around 802 and 814, soon tried to take advantage of the fall of the Avars and invaded former Avar territories, but no contemporaneous report mentioned his conquest in the Carpathian Basin. The Abodrites who lived in \"Dacia on the Danube as neighbors of the Bulgars\" sent envoys to Emperor Louis the Pious in 824, complaining \"about vicious aggression by the Bulgars\" and seeking the emperor's assistance against them, according to the \"Royal Frankish Annals\". The Abodrites inhabited the lands along either the Timiș or the Tisza. According to a memorial inscription from Provadia, a Bulgar military commander, Onegavonais, drowned in the Tisza, implying Omurtag of Bulgaria's attempts to expand his rule in the region in the 820s. The Bulgars invaded Moravia in 863 and 883, suggesting that they controlled at least the crossing-points across the rivers Mureș and Tisza, according to the historian István Bóna.\n\nBóna writes that the \"Bavarian Geographer\" is the last source which contains contemporaneous information of the eastern regions of the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. According to this source, which is actually a list of the tribes inhabiting the lands east of the Carolingian Empire around 840, the \"Merehani\", who had 30 \"civitates\", or fortified centers, lived along the southernmost parts of the empire's eastern frontiers. Their land also bordered on Bulgaria. According to an alternative theory of the location of Moravia, which is primarily based on the \"Bavarian Geographer\" and Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus's report of \"great Moravia, the unbaptized\", Banat was the center of this early medieval polity, which was annihilated by the conquering Magyars. Archaeologist Silviu Oța identifies the Merehani with the Abodrites, adding that they were obviously a Slavic tribe. The name of the Karaš and other rivers implies that a population speaking a Turkic languageAvar, Bulgar, or Pechenegalso inhabited the Banat in the Early Middle Ages, but those rivers may have received their names only in the 11th or 12th centuries.\n\nHistorian Vlad Georgescu writes that archaeological research has proven the existence of about 60 settlements in Glad's duchy. Other historians, including Sălăgean and Pop, say that the earth-and-wooden or stone fortresses unearthed at Bulci, Cenad, Ilidia, Orșova, Pescari, and Vladimirescu were Glad's forts. Florin Curta says that the dating of these sites is uncertain.\n\nAccording to the \"Gesta Hungarorum\", Rus' princes gave a short description of the Carpathian Basin to the Magyar commanders before they decided to invade the territory. The princes told them that \"Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, and the shepherds of the Romans\" inhabited the territory. In short, Anonymus continued, one of the princes, the Prince of Halych, also informed the Magyar leaders of the polities among which the territory was divided and their rulers. Among these local rulers, the Rus' prince listed Glad who had \"taken possession of the land from the river Mureș up to the castle\" of \"Ursua\" (Orşova or Vršac) with the help of the Cumans. In another chapter of the \"Gesta\", Anonymus wrote that Glad \"held power from the Mureș River to the castle of Palanka\", showing that he identified Glad's duchy with the territory that is now known as Banat. Anonymus explicitly referred to Glad as \"the prince of that country\" in the same chapter.\n\nThe \"Gesta\" did not write of the peoples inhabiting Glad's duchy. On the other hand, it stated that Glad commanded \"a great army of horsemen and foot soldiers\" and his army was \"supported by Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs\". According to Tudor Sălăgean and other Romanian historians, the list of the peoples reflects the one-time ethnic composition of the Banat, showing that a Turkic people (Pechenegs, Avars or Kabars), Bulgarians and Vlachs, or Romanians, inhabited the region in the late 9th century. Historian Victor Spinei writes that Anonymus's reference to the \"Cumans\" supporting Glad's army shows that Glad sought the Pechenegs' assistance against the invading Magyars.\n\nAnonymus wrote that Glad had come \"from the castle of Vidin\" and occupied his duchy \"with the help of the Cumans\". This report, together with Anonymus's reference to the Bulgarians' assistance against the Magyars, suggests that Glad was subjected to Simeon I of Bulgaria, according to Sălăgean. This theory is not accepted by historian Ioan-Aurel Pop, who writes that it is only an \"attractive\" scholarly hypothesis which has not been proven. Madgearu says that the Banat, which had been an integral part of Bulgaria since the late 820s, became an independent state under Glad's rule after the death of Simeon I in 927. Pop also says Anonymus's reference to Glad's arrival from Vidin suggest that Glad was either Bulgarian or Romanian, because the region of that town was densely populated by Romanians. The name of Glad is most probably of South Slavic origin, according to Pop and Neagu Djuvara. In connection with Glad, Anonymus also emphasized that \"from his line was born\" a chieftain, named Ahtum, whom Stephen I of Hungary defeated in the first half of the 11th century, according to the \"Long Life of Saint Gerard\".\n\nAccording to the \"Gesta Hungarorum\", the Magyars conquered the lands between the Danube and the Tisza, Transylvania, the western regions of present-day Slovakia and Transdanubia before their supreme head, Árpád, and his chieftains decided to send an army to invade Glad's duchy. They dispatched three commandersnamed \"Zovárd, Kadocsa, and Vajta\"with the task. The three commanders crossed the Tisza at Kanjiža and halted at the Csesztreg River before advancing as far as the Bega River. In the next two weeks, they forced the inhabitants of the region between the Mureș and Someș to yield and to give their sons as hostages. Thereafter, Anonymus continued, the Magyar army marched towards the Timiș and \"encamped beside the ford of Foeni\" where they wanted to cross the river. However, Glad and his large army awaited them on the other bank. A day later, Zovárd \"enjoined his brother, Kadocsa, to go lower down with half his army and try to cross in any way in order to attack the enemy\", and Kadocsa obeyed this command. Both divisions crossed the river and stormed the enemy camp. In the battle, \"two dukes of the Cumans and three \"kneses\" of the Bulgarians were slain\" before Glad decided to retreat, but his army was annihilated.\n\nAnonymus writes that Glad took shelter in \"the castle of Kovin\", while the Magyars marched to \"the borders of the Bulgarians\" and encamped at the Ponjavica River. Zovárd, Kadocsa and Vajta laid siege to Kovin, forcing Glad to surrender it three days later. In short, they also seized Orșova where they lived \"for a whole month\", according to the \"Gesta\". Vajta returned to Árpád, taking with him the hostages and the booty, while Zovárd and Kadocsa sent an envoy to Árpád to ask permission to invade the Byzantine Empire. Ioan-Aurel Pop writes that Glad must have survived his defeat and recovered at least parts of his duchy in exchange for paying a tribute to the Magyars, because his descendant, Ahtum, ruled the territory some decades later, according to Anonymus.\n\nGlad is one of the local rulers who are mentioned only in the \"Gesta Hungarorum\". Historians have continuously debated the reliability of Anonymus's work which was first published in 1746. Anonymus's reference to the Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs supporting Glad is one of the key points in the scholarly debate, because the Cumans did not arrive in Europe before the 1050s. Vlad Georgescu, Victor Spinei, Ioan-Aurel Pop and many other Romanian historians identify the \"Cumans\", or \"Cumani\", as Pechenegs, Avars or Kabars, saying that the Hungarian word that Anonymus translated as \"Cuman\" \"(kun)\" originally dubbed any Turkic tribe. According to other historians, including Dennis Deletant, György Györffy and Carlile Aylmer Macartney, Anonymus's reference to the three peoples is an anachronism, which reflects the ethnic composition of the late 13th-century Bulgaria.\n\nIn Romanian historiography, Glad is presented as one of the three local \"\"voivodes\"\" who ruled territories inhabited by Romanians at the time of the Hungarian Conquest. Madgearu and Pop list almost a dozen place-names from the Banat and its wider region which suggest that settlements were named after Glad. For instance, a village named Cladova (formerly \"Galadua\") and a monastery named Galad were first mentioned in 1308 and 1333, respectively, and an Ottoman document from 1579 referred to two villages named Gladeš and a settlement named Kladova. Silviu Oța writes that the theory of a connection between Glad and the name of those settlements is \"considerably weak\", because neither the origins nor the chronology of those place names have so far been thoroughly studied. Oţa also says, \"the historical geography of the Banat is reflected quite accurately in the chronicle\", which suggests that Anonymus knew the geographical features of the region, but does not prove that Glad was a real person. According to Györffy and other historians, Anonymus who invented all local rulers in the \"Gesta\" named Glad after the village where the monastery was built. Deletant, Macartney and other scholars also say that Anonymus seems to have borrowed many episodes of his narrative of Glad (including his connection with Vidin) from the story of his alleged descendant, Ahtum, in the \"Long Life of Saint Gerard\".\n\n\n\n"}

The airplane, a Douglas DC-9, was carrying 31 passengers and crew. None of them survived the crash.\n\nMultiple eyewitnesses reported that the plane was on fire shortly after it took off from the airport. The fire was caused due to a failure on the right engine where one of its removable sleeve spacers detached. The removable sleeve spacer suffered metal fatigue which caused the engine to explode.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the investigation team who was responsible for the investigation of the crash, concluded that despite the plane suffering engine failure, it was still controllable, and instead the response of the crew to the failure was the main cause of the accident. The crew failed to properly control the plane during the emergency. Breakdown of the crew's coordination also contributed the crash.\n\nOn September 6, 1985, Flight 105 was a Midwest Express Airlines flight scheduled to be operated using a Douglas DC-9-14 twin-engine, single-aisle jet airliner (registration \"N100ME\"). The DC-9 was manufactured in 1968 and delivered to Linea Aeropostal Venezolana. In 1976, it was sold to Aerovias Venezolanas, S.A., who then sold it to K-C Aviation (the owner of Midwest Express) in 1983. The aircraft had accrued a total of 31,892 operating hours and 48,903 cycles at the time of the accident.\n\nFlight 105 departed Milwaukee carrying 27 passengers and 4 crew members. Most of the passengers were businessmen.\n\nThe two stewardess of the flight was 24-year old Sharon Ann Herb and 21-year old Amy Marie Bain.\n\nInstead of a captain and first officer, Flight 105 was crewed by two captains.\n\nThe first captain of the flight was 31-year old Captain Danny Watkin Martin. Captain Martin was employed by Midwest Express in 1984 as a First Officer. He was promoted as a Captain in 1985 and had accumulated a total flying hours of 4,600 flight hours, including 1,000 hours on the DC-9 (600 flight hours as a First Officer on the DC-9, and 500 hours as a captain). Before he was an employee of Midwest, he was a corporate pilot of a Beechcraft 90 King Air.\n\nThe second captain, (acting as first officer) was 37-year old Captain Roger William Weiss. Captain Weiss was employed by Midwest Express in 1984 and later received his DC-9 type rating. At the time, he had accrued 5,197 total flight hours, including 1,640 hours on the DC-9 (500 hours as a First Officer of the DC-9 and 1,140 hours as a captain). He was a former employee of KC Aviation, the parent company of Midwest Express. Captain Weiss was also a former US Air Force pilot, flying an F-4.\n\nFlight 105 took off at 15:20 with 27 passengers and 4 crew members. Flight 105 departed from Mitchell's Runway 19R en route to its destination of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Int'l Airport, Atlanta, Georgia. Before the flight, the plane had previously been operated as Flight 206 with the same flight crew.\n\nAt 15:21, during its initial climb, at an altitude of 700 ft above the ground, the right engine exploded. Flight 105 swayed several times. Captain Martin heard the loud bang and reacted: \"What the * was that?\", which was not responded to by First Officer Weiss. Flight 105 was then instructed by the ATC to turn towards heading 175. At this stage, the ATC worker could see that smoke and flames were emanating from the right engine, with parts of the plane falling to the ground.\n\nFirst Officer Weiss declared an emergency. The plane then climbed with a high angle of attack. Due to the high angle of attack, the air speed decreased significantly. It began to roll to the right, and then stalled and rolled abruptly to an angle of 90 degrees, barrel-rolled at least once, and crashed into an open field in a wildlife preserve just several hundred meters from runway 19R. The aircraft was completely demolished by impact forces and fire, with nearly the entire structure fragmented. Eyewitnesses claimed that a few passengers and crew members survived the initial impact but succumbed to injuries or exposure to smoke, fire, and toxic fumes before help could reach them.\n\nRoughly 100 eyewitnesses stated that they saw flames and smoke from the right engine shortly after the explosion and that some parts of the plane detached and fell to the ground. They also stated that loud bangs were continuously heard during the accident. Shortly afterwards, the crew lost control of the plane and the plane crashed into the field. Investigators then constructed several possible scenarios as to what might have caused the plane to lose control.\n\nInvestigators immediately examined the fragments of the engine. They stated that the explosion might have been powerful enough to propel fragments of the turbine with sufficient speed to penetrate the plane and damage the flight controls, which could explain why the plane suddenly pitched up and barrel-rolled immediately after the explosion. 5 years before the crash of Flight 105, in Poland an Ilyushin Il-62 crashed into a moat after its engine number 2 exploded and damaged the plane's elevator and aileron. Immediately after the explosion, the plane nosedived to the ground.\n\nThe explosion was caused by a detached removable sleeve spacer inside the right engine. The detachment was caused by metal fatigue. Examination of the turbine fragments and their distribution during the explosion led to the conclusion that the ejection of the fragments didn't contribute to the crash, as the velocity of the fragments was substantially absorbed and decreased by the engine cowling. The NTSB noted that several parts of the engine could not be found; they concluded that, based on their calculation and distribution of the fragments on the ground, the unidentified parts were reduced to tiny, harmless bits. The left engine did not exhibit any signs of pre-impact damage or failure\n\nThe NTSB also stated that, although the explosion caused serious damage to the engine cowling, the cowlings were all latched. None blew outwards, which would have caused a massive drag force on the plane. This, in turn, could have affected the controllability of the plane. Small portions of the cowling did blow outwards, but the NTSB concluded that these parts caused very little drag force.\n\nThe NTSB later concluded that even if any turbine parts were ejected and somehow able to penetrate the plane, the impact would be small and no controls would be affected.\n\nIn the initial seconds after the explosion, Flight 105 swayed to the right and left. In response, the pilot used the rudder to counteract the plane's movements. The examination concluded that the plane was easily controllable and that it could still be controlled properly without the rudder inputs. Additionally, the crew made a pitch input, raising the aircraft's nose.\n\nThe crew may have wrongly perceived the nature of the emergency. Since the explosion of the engine caused the loss of engine thrust, the speed of the plane decreased. This rapid deceleration caused the crew to think that the plane was pitching down, which may explain why the crew made a nose-up input, while in reality, it didn't pitch down. This phenomenon is known as a somatogravic illusion. However, instead of fixing the situation, the nose-up input that the crew made only caused the plane to decelerate even more. The pilot may have suffered spatial disorientation immediately after the emergency.\n\nThe NTSB noted that the plane had banked to the right to such a severe angle that the plane entered a state which investigators call an \"accelerated stall\".\n\nDuring the emergency, Captain Martin called for the instrument readings to First Officer Weiss. However, Weiss didn't reply to any of his questions or remarks. Since an emergency had occurred on board the plane, First Officer Weiss should have responded and worked with Martin in order to handle the emergency properly. Weiss' failure to respond may have further confused Captain Martin.\n\nInvestigators stated that Weiss also might have been confused by the information on his instruments. They also stated that Weiss' action might have been influenced by Midwest Express' \"silent cockpit\" philosophy.\n\nMidwest Express expected its pilots to adhere to an unwritten policy called the \"silent cockpit\", where pilots would make no unnecessary callouts or even verbalize the nature of an emergency after 100 knots and before reaching an altitude of 800 ft. The emergency on board Flight 105 that day started at roughly 700 ft above the ground, meaning that the \"silent cockpit\" rule was in effect at the time. Investigators stated that the pilots should have worked together immediately since an emergency that occurred at low altitude was dangerous. With the silent cockpit rule, the crew's ability to effectively work together would have been hampered. This rule conflicted with FAA regulations and therefore should have been prohibited by the FAA.\n\nSeconds after the failure of the right engine, Captain Martin applied proper inputs to the plane. However, he was uncertain about the situation of Flight 105 at the time. Due to this, he asked First Officer Weiss for assistance. The NTSB, on their report, stated that Martin might have asked Weiss as he was far more senior and had more experience. He may have thought that Weiss was far more knowledgeable than him in identifying the nature of the emergency. Weiss didn't respond to any of Martin's remarks and questions. Based on the evidence from the CVR, investigators believe that Weiss actually heard Martin's questions and remarks but ignored them for some reason. He was not incapacitated, as evidence from the recordings indicated that he communicated with Milwaukee Tower while Martin was asking him about the information of the plane's instruments.\n\nCaptain Martin held primary responsibility for handling the emergency and taking corrective actions. However, the emergency should have been handled by both men working together as a team. Weiss should have assisted the Captain in responding and diagnosing the problem that had occurred on board Flight 105. The NTSB stated:\n\n\"The redundancy provided by the First Officer is one the basic tenets of Cockpit Resource Management.\"\n\nThe NTSB then concluded that breakdown in crew coordination was one of the main causes of the accident, one possibility being their youthfulness and inexperience--the combined age of the two captains was only 68.\n\nThe lack of experience of an FAA officer might have caused the silent cockpit philosophy to be approved by the FAA without proper examination. The philosophy was contrary to the approved practice by the FAA. If she had more experience, she may have recognized that the concept had flaws, and that the airline was already teaching the concept to their employees.\n\nThe NTSB believed that the FAA agent who worked with Midwest Express did not perform her duties at an adequate level. As per the final report:\n\n\"The safety board believes that the FAA oversight of Midwest Express procedures and training during certification and ongoing day-to-day activity in the carrier's first 2 years of operation was less than optimum and probably suffered as a direct result of the inexperience of the POI. The POI testified that she devoted only 20 percent of her worktime to Midwest Express, her only FAR 121 scheduled passenger airline, and that she was still obligated to perform routine general aviation rules. The Board noted that the POI had no previous FAR 121 air carrier experience, that she was not rated in a turbojet of the category and class used by the airline, and that she had not rated received any formal training in the DC-9 airplane used by the certificate holder for which she was responsible. In fact, she had no turbojet pilot experience. Neither did the POI have available for consultation or assistance air carrier inspectors assigned to other offices to fulfill her responsibilities. Apparently, she had become so dependent on other inspectors in surveilling Midwest Express that her own role was reduced primarily to administrative matters. The absence of first-hand knowledge of the carrier and her lack of experience in turbojet air carrier operations severely handicapped her ability to perform the quality of surveillance required to detect shortcomings of FAR 121 airline operation. The Safety Board believes that the experience level of the POI was inappropriate for her assignment as the POI of a new air carrier operating turbojet equipment. She even testified that she was not totally comfortable with the arrangement.\"\n\n\n"}

It was then further developed by George Koltanowski. \n\nThis variation of the Queen's Pawn Game is characterised by a systematic if modest development of White's minor pieces to support a quick pawn move to the e4 square. It is solid, but inflexible.\nColle and Koltanowski each won many tournaments in the 1920s and 1930s. Colle finished ahead of Tartakower, Euwe and Rubinstein at various times. The opening had even been referred to as the “dreaded” Colle System. George Koltanowski, in his book, “The Colle System” said it offered “solid development”, combinations, a decent endgame, and it gives White “good chances of not losing against a stronger player”. However, players like Capablanca and Tal found ways to take the sting out of some of its various lines. One such line that has been tested is 3...Bf5, sometimes called the “Anti-Colle.” \n\nIgnoring Black's responses in order to consider White's moves only, the typical plan is as follows:\n\nwith White rearranging the move order appropriately. It is a perfectly solid scheme of development, but, inflexibly applied, it cannot offer more than equality against a vigorous Black response. It may be a good tool for avoiding book variations, for Blitz play, or for forcing opponents to think for themselves early on. These days it is considered totally innocuous, and is rarely seen at Master level or above.\n\nThe strategic plan behind the Colle System is to aim for a kingside attack. The black king's knight will be either exchanged off on e4, or driven away by the advance e4–e5. This removes a guard from the h7 square, often enabling a classic bishop sacrifice on h7 as the start of a mating attack. Some authors even call this sacrifice \"Colle's sacrifice\".\n\nOne variation on the Colle is the Colle–Zukertort System (named for Johannes Zukertort), characterized by developing the dark-squared bishop on b2. The typical plan is: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.e3 Nf6 4.Bd3 c5 5.b3 Nc6 6.0-0 Bd6\n7.Bb2 0-0. In this variation White will eventually play for a kingside attack, despite their apparently innocuous development. This system has been frequently employed at grandmaster level by Artur Yusupov.\nA famous Colle system win featuring a slightly unusual Bxh7 sacrifice is Colle–O'Hanlon, 1930. Analysts have debated this sacrifice's theoretical soundness for many years. \n\nBlack has a variety of approaches to counter the Colle System. One of the most dynamic is to aim for a Queen's Indian Defense style setup. White's pawn push to e4 slashes at empty space, while Black's pieces are poised to undermine White's centre and attack the queenside. The technique is well illustrated in the 1929 game between Colle and José Capablanca: \n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1915368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915368", "title": "The Glass Key", "text": "The Glass Key\n\nThe Glass Key is a novel by American writer Dashiell Hammett. It was first published as a serial in \"Black Mask\" magazine in 1930, then was collected in 1931 (in London; the American edition followed 3 months later). It tells the story of a gambler and racketeer, Ned Beaumont, whose devotion to Paul Madvig, a crooked political boss, leads him to investigate the murder of a local senator's son as a potential gang war brews. Hammett dedicated the novel to his onetime lover Nell Martin.\n\nThere have been two US film adaptations (1935 and 1942) of the novel. A radio adaptation starring Orson Welles aired on March 10, 1939, as part of his \"Campbell Playhouse\" series. The book was also a major influence on the Coen brothers' 1990 film \"Miller's Crossing\", about a gambler who is a right-hand man to a corrupt political boss and their involvement in a brewing gang war.\n\nThe Glass Key Award (in Swedish, \"Glasnyckeln\"), named after the novel, has been presented annually since 1992 for the best crime novel by a Scandinavian writer.\n\nThe story revolves around Ned Beaumont, a gambler and best friend of the criminal political boss Paul Madvig. Ned finds the body of a senator's son on the street, and Madvig asks him to thwart the D.A.'s investigation, his motive being that he wants to back the corrupt senator in order to marry his daughter, Janet. Ned goes to New York searching for Bernie, a bookie who owes him a great deal of money from a gambling debt but ends up getting beaten up.\n\nSomeone sends a series of letters to people close to the crime, hinting that Madvig was the murderer. Suspicion for this falls on Madvig's daughter Opal, the victim's girlfriend. Madvig's political base begins to crumble when he refuses to spring a follower's brother from jail. The follower goes to rival mob boss Shad O'Rory, who eliminates a witness to the brother's crime. Madvig then declares war on O'Rory, who offers to bribe Beaumont to expose Madvig in the newspaper. Beaumont refuses, is knocked unconscious and wakes captive in a dingy room where he is beaten daily.\n\nHospitalized after his escape, Beaumont tells Madvig and Janet that he was laying a trap for O'Rory; he then struggles out of bed to stop the newspaper from printing its expose. Beaumont confronts O'Rory, the publisher, and Madvig's daughter Opal. The publisher commits suicide, after Beaumont seduces his wife.\n\nNext Beaumont interviews Janet, discovering that she wrote the letters and that the Senator knew about the murder before Beaumont found the body. A new clue points to Madvig and when confronted he confesses but he cannot account for the victim's hat, a detail Beaumont pointedly repeats throughout the novel.\n\nThis impasse and Beaumont's growing interest in Janet, Madvig's love interest, cause a second rift between the men. Beaumont and Janet pair up to solve the murder. Beaumont uncovers evidence proving the senator killed his own son and turns him over to the police. Beaumont confronts Madvig with his new discovery, and the two depart, not enemies but no longer friends.\n\n\nAs noted by the literary critic James F. Maxfield, \"Hammett employs an objective approach, merely reporting the conversations and describing the surface actions of his characters, never directly presenting their thoughts and feelings\". This leaves some ambiguity in the reasoning of Ned Beaumont's actions, such as his suspicions about Janet Henry's father. This makes it hard to determine the nature of Ned's relationship with Janet. While there is disagreement about whether or not they are together at the end, the fact that there is a relationship at all is indicative of \"a different kind of hero\".\n\nNed Beaumont does not fit the popular, famous archetype of Jung, nor the weaker, less altruistic \"hero\" type of Hammett's other works, but is altogether different from either.\n\nHammett's detectives usually avoid relationships, but Ned is different. He does not possess the sort of \"immunity\" to emotional ties that the author's previous detectives had maintained, such as the Continental Op in Hammett's \"Red Harvest\". Because of this supposed relationship between Ned and Janet, \"The Glass Key\" takes on a more traditional story line, that of the detective \"hero\" and his beautiful heroine, ending with a ride into the sunset of New York.\n\nAccording to Maxfield, \"Neither the Op nor [Hammett's detective character] Sam Spade would have gone off with Janet, for as detectives they both strove to be ruled as much as possible by reason. But Beaumont is a gambler instead of a detective, a man used to taking risks. Just as he continues to bet while he is on a losing streak, he is willing to make another kind of wager on Janet, despite the great odds of the relationship ending badly. Because he is willing to accept the risks that human commitments entail, Beaumont is, if not Hammett's ideal hero, his most completely human hero\".\n\nA more obvious theme in \"The Glass Key\" shows itself through the characters and their respective moralities. The novel is set in an unnamed city, a more unassuming place—a smaller, less sophisticated location—than his previous novels. It is thus a locale more obviously open to corruption. Here are elected officials, community figures, and the like who participate in conspiracies of a type more often considered endemic to the underworld. Because of this, the characters openly display more animalistic qualities than in Hammett's previous novels.\n\nThe characters, perhaps through the objectivity of the writing style, are portrayed as cutthroat and almost feral. One reason for their apparent slippage into violence is most likely related to the early onset of the Great Depression, as the novel was published in 1931. The loss of \"luck,\" as described in the novel (\"What good am I if my luck’s gone?\" He asks. \"You might as well take your punishment and get it over with\") is another deciding factor in the actions of the characters. The novel is similar in that respect to later Depression-era novels, such as \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\".\n\nHammett's distinctive and groundbreaking style helped usher in the hardboiled genre. \"The Glass Key\", written in Hammett's later noir years, is a prime example of his stylistic power. Raymond Chandler, a 20th-century author and critic, discussed Hammett's sense of the modern world in \"The Glass Key\":\n\nWilliam Kennedy, also a 20th-century author and book critic, explained what is so complex about Hammett's writing style: \"Hammett's strategy is to show the process of detection as motivated by and affecting a friendship between two men. Out of these materials Hammett creates a dynamic structure of uncertain, constantly shifting human relationships.\"\n\nIn \"The Glass Key\", Hammett refuses to let the reader into the characters' minds. Perhaps Hammett felt all fiction should lack an inner monologue; in the real world people only understand actions and speech and that is all Hammett's characters give us. By keeping the readers in the dark of his characters true intentions, he intensifies our sense of the ambiguous nature of reality. That is to say, we never can trust if a character is doing what he is doing out of loyalty, or for selfish intentions.\n\nThere is general agreement that \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"The Glass Key\" are Hammett's two finest books. With the passing years Hammett looked more and more harshly on his own fiction but conceded that \"The Glass Key\" was \"not so bad\". Its reception was even better than that of the previous novel, and so were sales, 20,000 copies having been sold eighteen months after publication. Some preferred the \"Falcon\", others said simply that Hammett had written the three best detective stories of all time, and in the \"New Yorker\" Dorothy Parker screamed that \"there is entirely too little screaming about the work of Dashiell Hammett\".\n\nHammett felt that the finished book was his best work, nonetheless because \"the clues were nicely placed... although nobody seemed to notice\". Reviewers were less sanguine. David T. Bazelon, writing for \"Commentary\", thought that Hammett had attempted a conventional novel, in which characters act for reasons of loyalty, passion or power. Even on those generous grounds, he found the novel unsatisfactory: \"We never know whether [the] motive in solving the murder is loyalty, job-doing or love... this ambiguity reflects, I think, Hammett's difficulty in writing an unformularized novel-- one in which an analysis of motives is fundamental\". Other critics wrote that the novel was \"Hammett’s least satisfactory\" and that the hero was \"mechanical and his emotions were not there\". Robert Edenbaum, for basically the same reasons, called \"The Glass Key\" Hammett's \"least satisfactory novel... [in Hemingway] the mask is lifted every time the character is alone; he admits his misery to himself...exposes his inner life. The Hammett mask is never lifted; the Hammett character never lets you inside. Instead of the potential despair of Hemingway, Hammett gives you unimpaired control and machinelike efficiency\".\n\nLouis Untermeyer wrote, \"Hammett has done something extraordinarily new to the murder and mystery story. He has made the reader as much interested in the relation of his individuals to each other as in the solution of the story\". Somerset Maugham saw in Ned Beaumont \"a curious, intriguing character whom any novelist would have been proud to conceive\" And Raymond Chandler found \"an effect of movement, intrigue, cross-purposes, and the gradual elucidation of character, which is all the detective story has any right to be about anyway. All the rest is spillikins in the parlor\".\n\nDashiell Hammett and his novel \"The Glass Key\" have influenced many other hardboiled writers. Raymond Chandler wrote in his oft-cited essay \"The Simple Art of Murder\" that Hammett and other hardboiled writers created a style that removed the puzzle-game intrigues of typical detective novels and instead replaced it with realism: \"Where murder is committed for reasons, and people talk and act as real people do\". Chandler argued that it is due to these authors that this style is developed and raised from a generic form to a \"new level of artistic substance\".\n\nTogether with Hammett's 1929 novel \"Red Harvest\", \"The Glass Key\" provided inspiration for the Coen brothers' 1990 film \"Miller's Crossing\".\n\nThe 1942 film adaptation appears briefly in the season 2 finale of the show Bosch during a conversation between Bosch and the detective on his mother's murder case.\n\nThe novel was adapted for the 1935 film \"The Glass Key\", directed by Frank Tuttle and produced by E. Lloyd Sheldon, with a screenplay by Kathryn Scola and Kubec Glasmon. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures. The lead characters were portrayed by George Raft as Ed [not Ned] Beaumont, Edward Arnold as Paul Madvig, and Claire Dodd as Janet Henry. \n\nAnother film, also entitled \"The Glass Key\", was released in 1942, directed by Stuart Heisler and produced by Buddy G. DeSylva, with a screenplay by Jonathan Latimer. It was also distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film starred Alan Ladd as Ed [not Ned] Beaumont, Brian Donlevy as Paul Madvig, and Veronica Lake as Janet Henry. The Irish mobster Shad O'Rory, who played a major role in both the novel and the first film adaptation (in which he was portrayed by Robert Gleckler), was replaced in the second film by a Mediterranean mobster, Nick Varna, portrayed by the Maltese actor Joseph Calleia.\n\n\"The Glass Key\" was adapted by Howard E. Koch for the March 10, 1939, episode of Orson Welles's CBS Radio series \"The Campbell Playhouse\". The cast included Welles (Paul Madvig), Paul Stewart (Ned Beaumont), Ray Collins (Shad O'Rory), Myron McCormick (Senator Henry), Effie Palmer (Mrs. Madvig), Elspeth Eric (Opal Madvig), Elizabeth Morgan (telephone operator), Everett Sloane (Farr), Howard Smith (Jeff), Laura Baxter (Janet Henry) and Edgar Barrier (Rusty).\n\nAnother adaptation, by Robert Cenedella, was presented on \"Hour of Mystery\" on ABC on July 7, 1946. Kenneth Webb was the director, and Edwin Marshall was the producer.\n\n\"The Glass Key\" was adapted as part of the \"Westinghouse Studio One\" television series by screenwriter Worthington Miner and director George Zachary. TV version starred Donald Briggs, Lawrence Fletcher and Jean Carson and was originally broadcast May 11, 1949.\n\n"}

The word 'Fling' means literally a movement in dancing. In John Jamieson's \"Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language\", 1808, the Highland Fling was defined as 'one species of movement' in dancing, not as one particular movement. There is some speculation that the first solo Highland Fling dances simply showed off steps that individual dancers preferred in the Strathspey Reel, a social dance.\n\nThis dance is now performed at dance competitions and events around the world. One goal of dancers today is to stay in the same spot throughout the dance. The Highland Fling is danced at almost all competition levels, from primary to premier. It is also performed for Highland and theory examinations. Dancers wear the standard kilt outfit to perform this dance. It is in time.\n\nA version of a Fling in a percussive dance style was remembered and danced by John Gillis in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, and those steps were written down in 1957 by Frank Rhodes. Each step was preceded by a travelling step in a circular pathway danced to the first part of the tune Sterling Castle, while the individual Fling steps were danced to the second part of the tune.\n\nThe Highland Fling is referenced in the lyrics of Harlem hot jazz musician Harry Gibson's 1947 hit, \"Who put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy's Ovaltine?\"\n\nThe dance can be done as a:\n\nThe first and last steps must always be danced in those places, but the rest of the steps are up to the dancer to choose.

There are many more steps in existence, some of which have been recorded in publications, for example, \"Traditional Step-Dancing in Scotland\", while some exist only in the memories of senior dancers .\n\nThe current (2008) tempo recommended by the SOBHD for the Highland Fling is 112-124 bpm. This has slowed considerably over the years – from 192 bpm one hundred years ago, 152 bpm in the 1960s and then 134 bpm in the 1980s.\n\n\n\nThe Highland Fling can also been seen in the 2002 film \"Nicholas Nickleby\", performed by Alan Cumming.\n"}

{"id": "1915385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915385", "title": "Direct inward dial", "text": "Direct inward dial\n\nDirect inward dialling (DID), also called direct dial-in (DDI) in Europe and Oceania, is a telecommunication service offered by telephone companies to subscribers who operate a private branch exchange (PBX) system. The feature provides service for multiple telephone numbers over one or more analog or digital physical circuits to the PBX, and transmits the dialed telephone number to the PBX so that a PBX extension is directly accessible for an outside caller, possibly by-passing an auto-attendant.\n\nFor direct inward dialing service, the telephone company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization without the need for an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring only a limited number of physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.\n\nTraditionally, DID service used analog circuits. In these types of DID trunks the customer premises equipment provided signaling battery. The central office equipment detects the level of the line and disables service if the circuit is not operational. This is the reverse arrangement from standard plain old telephone service (POTS) lines for which the central office provides signaling and talk battery. Nowadays, it is far more common to deliver DID service on a Primary Rate Interface (PRI) circuit.\n\nThe trunks for DID service are unidirectional, inbound to the customer PBX. However, the service may be combined with \"direct outward dialing\" (DOD) allowing PBX extensions direct outbound calling capability with identification of their DID telephone number.\n\nIn the United States the feature was developed by AT&T in the 1960s, patterned upon the earlier IKZ service of the Deutsche Bundespost in Germany.\n\nDID service is also used by fax servers. A telephone line is terminated at a telephone interface (fax modem) of a computer that runs fax server software. A set of digits of the assigned phone numbers are used to identify the recipient of the fax. This allows many recipients to have an individual fax number, even though there is only one fax machine available.\n\nSome voice over IP (VoIP) vendors have used one central, remotely located fax server as a means of offering Internet fax service to their clients. In theory, standards such as T.38 should have allowed VoIP subscribers to keep their existing fax equipment working locally; in practice, T.38 at the subscriber's site offers no benefit if the upstream provider is least-cost routing to gateways that do not support T.38 and cannot reliably send or receive fax/modem traffic. A fax server at a central location, connected directly to public switched telephone network (PSTN) T-carrier primary rate interface lines and using direct inward dial to identify the intended addressee can convert an incoming fax to an electronic document (such as .tif or .pdf) for web or e-mail delivery. The fax traffic never passes through the VoIP infrastructure as a dial-up modem call and therefore arrives reliably even if T.38 is not properly supported at some points in the network.\n\nDID service has similar relevance for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications. To allow public switched telephone network (PSTN) users to directly reach users with VoIP phones, DID numbers are assigned to a communications gateway. The gateway connects the PSTN to the VoIP network, routing and translating calls between the two networks.\n\nIn countries with multiple competing local providers, DID services can be purchased in bulk from a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC).\n\nFor voice over IP resellers, some specialized CLECs (for local numbers) or interexchange carriers (for toll-free numbers) will deliver blocks of direct inward dial calls already converted to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or common VoIP formats. The individual VoIP provider need only obtain an inventory of local or freephone numbers from VoIP-aware carriers in various regions, import them in bulk to an IP PBX and issue them individually to end users. International DID numbers can be purchased in bulk from international providers.\n\nUK geographic DID numbers can often be obtained for free and can be terminated over SIP. A few US DIDs are available without monthly charges from vendors like IPKall (discontinued in 2016), but at the expense of the caller paying for a call to some expensive, rural location.\n\nThe majority of vendors charge a nominal amount per number per month (as little as $1/month in small quantities) and then bill per-minute or per number of channels which can be simultaneously in use. For the caller, these numbers can be assigned to locations which are a local call.\n\nThe corresponding service to DID for outgoing calls from a PBX to the central office exchange is called \"direct outward dialing\" (DOD) or \"Direct Dial Central Office\" (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or \"caller-id\" of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.\n\n"}

He is best known as the \"Little Nemesis\" of Laurel and Hardy. He appeared in nearly 50 films with them, making Hall the most frequent supporting actor in the comedy duo's productions.\n\nHall was born in Ward End, Birmingham, Warwickshire, and learned carpentry as a trade; however, as a teenager, he became a member of the Fred Karno troupe of stage comedians. In his late teens, he visited his sister in New York City and stayed there, finding employment as a stagehand. While working behind the scenes, he met the comic actor Bobby Dunn and they became friends; Dunn convinced Hall to take a stab again at acting, which he did. By the mid-1920s, Hall was working for Hal Roach. Stan Laurel, one of Roach's comedy stars, was also a graduate of the Karno troupe.\n\nAs an actor, Hall worked with such comedians as Buster Keaton and Charley Chase, but he is best remembered as a comic foil for Laurel and Hardy. He appeared in nearly 50 of their films, sometimes in bit parts, but often as a mean landlord or opponent in many of their memorable tit-for-tat sequences. Unlike the usual villains in Laurel and Hardy films, who were big and burly, Charlie Hall (billed as \"Charley\" Hall in the Roach comedies) was of short stature, standing 5 ft 5 in tall. His height and slight English accent allowed him to be convincingly cast as a college student, despite being 40 years old, in Laurel and Hardy's \"A Chump at Oxford\".\n\nHall almost never played starring roles; the exception was in 1941, when he was teamed with character comedian Frank Faylen by Monogram Pictures.

To support the continuing revolutionary movements in Western Europe, Adam Mickiewicz outreached to the Polish community in Italy to form the Polish Legion which would serve the Italian initiative until the Austrians were completely driven out of the country. Though Mickiewicz was deeply influenced by Messianism, he believed this was a time when more than just spirituality was needed: it was a time for political action. The independence of Poland, Mickiewicz believed, started in Rome. On October 5, 1847, in a meeting of the Circle of God's Work, Mickiewicz announced, \"The manifestation of the Christian spirit, the construction of the state for Christ, must originate in Rome, which is both church and state. Summoned to conquer for the spirit a state on earth, we must proceed on the earth, starting from Rome, which is our support.\" Hence, Mickiewicz and nine other compatriots traveled to Rome, where they summoned help for their mission. Mickiewicz had hoped to receive the support of Pope Pius IX, but many people rejected his proposals: even the majority of Poles living in Italy were unfavorable to the cause. Other opposers were the clergy because of his adherence to Messianism, and the aristocracy because of his strong social ideals and the threat to their wealth and power should Poland become independent again. On March 25, 1848, Mickiewicz pleaded with Pius IX for his moral support, but after several failed attempts, Mickiewicz proceeded independently to create the constitutional program of the Polish Legion. The manifesto \"\"Skład zasad, czyli Symbol polityczny Polski\"\" (A collection of principles of a Political symbol of Poland) was composed by Mickiewicz for the legion and in fifteen short articles advocated freedom of conscience, equality of all citizens, equality of women, enfranchisement of peasants, solidarity and brotherhood of Slavic nations. The first struggle for the legion would be to remove Austria from Italy assisted by Slavic deserters of the Austrian Army. On May 1, Mickiewicz, now with eleven members, sent out to Milan where they were joined by a military detachment of Polish emigrants, led by Mikolaj Kaminski, to request the formation of the Polish Legion from the government of Lombardy. The agreement would make the Legion dependent on this government. Once granted, the company then appealed to expand the Polish Legion to 600 people, which the provisional government of Milan allowed as well.\n\nThough the Legion faced financial problems and a shortage of arms, it grew to 120 members by June. Mickiewicz continued to search for volunteers in Paris while the Legion, commanded by Kaminski, engaged in several battles. They fought alongside others in Lombardy and on barricades of Genoa against the royalists, in the defence of the Roman Republic. The legionnaires also tried to help the revolutionaries in Hungary but were dispersed in Greece. However, the Mickiewicz Legion had been finally defeated in 1849. About five hundred people had served in the legion throughout its short fifteen-month existence.\n\n"}

This has many of the advantages of a thin client strategy, but can be done on any operating system base as long as the boot device is large enough to accommodate the boot and applications together.\n\nA typical departmental Windows XP boot image is usually so large that it requires a DVD to store, and may be too large for network booting. Accordingly, it is usually installed on a fixed or removable hard drive kept inside the machine, rather than installed over a network or from a ROM.\n\nThere are some boot image control complexity and total cost of operations advantages to using a departmental boot image instead of a common boot image for the entire organization, or a thin client:\n\nDisadvantages include the complexity of creating and managing several large boot images, and determining when a department needs to upgrade its applications. If each user is allowed to do this on their own, then, the discipline soon degrades and the shop will be no easier to manage than one that consists of one-off computers with their own quirks, frequently requiring re-imaging and whose issues are not really diagnosable nor comparable to each other. Some experts believe that any departmental boot image regime degrades rather quickly to this state without extraordinary discipline and controls, and advocate thin clients to ensure such control.\n\nIt is however increasingly possible to restrict users from installing \"their own\" applications on a standard boot image, and to automatically re-install when a variant boot image is detected. While this would be draconian in a large organization with one boot image it is often quite acceptable when the boot image is maintained at a departmental level and users can request that it be upgraded with a minimum of bureaucracy and waiting.\n"}

He was appointed by George Tenet on March 16, 2001.\n\nThe Executive Director is the third ranking position within the CIA and the incumbent functions essentially as the Chief Operating Officer of the Agency. For three years prior, Krongard had served as Counselor to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).\n\nA longtime consultant to DCIs, Krongard joined the Agency full-time in February 1998, following a 29-year business career. During his private sector career, he served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Alex. Brown & Sons, the nation's oldest investment banking firm, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust.\n\nKrongard received an A.B. degree (1958) with honors from Princeton University and a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Maryland School of Law. While at Princeton, Krongard played lacrosse. In 1980, he was inducted as a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Krongard played for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club. He served three years of active duty as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.\n\nKrongard resigned from the CIA shortly after the arrival of DCI Porter Goss in September 2004. While at the CIA, he was the connection between Erik Prince of Blackwater Security Consulting and the CIA. Through his influence, Blackwater was able to receive its first black contract.\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Krongard was appointed as an outside US director to the Global Board of Directors organized to oversee and coordinate the worldwide operations of DLA Piper, one of the world's largest law firms.\n\nKrongard is the brother of State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard.\n\nKrongard is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and resides in Baltimore, Maryland and McLean, Virginia. He was married to the late Patricia A. Lion and has three adult sons.\n\nPatrica Lion's sister, Margo Lion, is a Broadway theatre producer.\n\nOn 31 July 2004 Krongard married Cheryl Gordon (née Cheryl Gruetzmacher), at that time a senior executive for Apollo Management. She has since become a director of Legg Mason and US Airways.\n\nKrongard's name was brought up in conjunction with investigations into suspected 9/11-related insider trading because of timely Wall Street trades made through the investment bank he used to head, Alex. Brown.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report stated:\n\nA single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 (2001) as part of a strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter…which recommended these trades.\n\nAt a November 14, 2007 House oversight committee hearing about Blackwater, investigating allegations of improper interference by Krongard's brother, Howard, in Justice Department investigations of Blackwater and other State Department contractors, Chairman Henry Waxman stated that A. B. Krongard was on \"Blackwater's advisory board\". Howard Krongard at first denied that his brother had any connection with Blackwater, saying:\n\nI can tell you, very frankly, I am not aware of any financial interest or position he has with respect to Blackwater. When these ugly rumors started recently, I specifically asked him. I do not believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board that you stated. And that's something I think I need to say.\n\nHowever, when confronted with a July 26 letter from Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince to Buzzy Krongard asking him to join Blackwater's advisory board, followed by a September 5 letter welcoming Krongard to the board and a report from Rep. Elijah Cummings stating that Buzz Krongard had been expected to attend a Blackwater board meeting earlier that week, Krongard said he had called his brother during the ensuing break in the hearings and learned of this conflict of interest for the first time, saying \"I'm not my brother's keeper, and we don't discuss our business with each other\". He then recused himself from the investigation. Committee chairman Henry Waxman issued a memorandum summarizing the discrepancies between the two brothers' recollections of what Buzzy told Howard.\n"}

It may have been between Warwickshire and Worcestershire.\n\nAt Metchley Park, near Harborne, there are the remains of two large 1st century Roman forts, it is believed that they were used as a base during the invasion of Britain and could have been used in the first north-western advance into Cheshire and Wales. Much of the site is now gone; the construction of the banks of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal resulted in part destruction of the southern extremity of the camp, including most of its fort. The most recent excavation took place in 1999 and it was established that the main fort probably housed a cohors equitata milliaria, this comprised a minimum mixed force of 1,000 men who were heavily armoured foot-soldiers with a complement of a lightly armed cavalry unit.\n\nIn the 19th century people theorized that the camp was built by the ancient Britons (a theory supported by its being adjacent to the line of Ryknild Street) which runs through the area, others proposed that it was built by the Danes although no factual evidence supports this theory. Some few pieces of ancient weapons, such as swords and battle axes, and portions of bucklers have been found at the site.\n\nExcavations have uncovered Roman granaries, storehouses, barracks, a rampart with timber towers, a guard chamber, various smaller buildings, pottery and tools. These have dated the fort to a few years after the Romans first landed in Kent. It is now thought that the site was abandoned by the end of the 1st century.\n\nIn June 2006 new Roman artefacts were discovered next to a McDonald's in Kings Norton.\n\nLocal archaeologist Peter Osborn has suggested that there is a strong possibility that the battle between ancient Briton warrior queen Boadicea and the Romans took place in or around the area now called Birmingham sometime during 61 AD.\n\n\"We know for certain that the battle between the 200,000 ancient Britons and the Romans happened somewhere in the Midlands.\"\n\"This spot is on the route to Metchley, the Roman fort in Birmingham and it's for this reason, if no other, that we think this could be where the battle took place\".\n\nHowever Dr Simon Esmonde Cleary, an archaeology expert at the University of Birmingham, remains sceptical.\nUntil recently suggestions for the battle field site range from Leicestershire to Warwickshire.\n\nThe construction of new apartments has been put on hold until a full excavation is completed.\n\nThere was no news this century\n\nBy the early 16th century Birmingham was already a centre of metal working for example when Henry VIII was making plans to invaded Scotland in 1523 Birmingham smithies supplied bulk orders for bodkin arrowheads for use by his army.\n\nIn 1538 churchman John Leialand passed through the Midlands and wrote:\nThe two main towns responsible for military weapons at this time were Birmingham and London, Henry VIII however did not look kindly on British made weapons and he turned to Italy for help in the manufacture of bronze cannons, he bought shells and bombs from the Dutch and much of the armoury and swords came from the more experienced Flemish. The majority of gunpowder was delivered from Antwerp until the threatened invasion by the Spanish in 1588. Howard of Effingham and Sir Francis Drake failed to capitalise on an initial victory over Philip II of Spain's fleet and allowed it to sail up the Channel due to low supplies of imported gunpowder, this proved the importance of more British arms manufacture as opposed to relying on imports.\n\nDuring the attempted invasion by the Spanish Armada, the nobility and gentry of Birmingham and adjoining counties, contributed large sums of money which are said to have been sufficient to hire and equip around 43 war ships. A 19th century book of the region's history describes a subscription of £25 each from William Kinge and William Collmer (Colmore), of Burmingham; Richard Middlemore, Edgbaston; Mrs. Margarett Knowlys, Nuneaton; Gabriell Powltney, Knowle and Richard Corbett, Meryden, &c.\n\nBy the early part of the 17th century Birmingham resembled a large sprawling smith's village. Aided by the abundance of nearby sources of coal and iron ore, many metal workers set up small foundries and workshops. Birmingham was an important manufacturing town with a reputation for producing small arms, and the village's trade stretched far and wide. In 1637 a London cutler protested against the import of 'Bromedgham blades' which were often made of similar standard but at a lower cost.\n\nUnlike nearby towns such as Tamworth, Dudley, Hartlebury, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Burton and Lichfield Birmingham had little or no military defences.\n\nIn 1642 unrest between the Royalist (Worcestershire) and the Parliamentarians (Warwickshire) lead to many small battles and skirmishes taking place in the surrounding countryside. The allegiances around Birmingham were blurred with a mishmash of landowners, nobility and gentry all fighting for different sides.\n\nThe Royalists first passed through Birmingham proper in great force in 1642, the town was mainly Puritan, and some looting took place. As an apology to the town King Charles ordered two of his captains to be hanged, this did not appease the town and some time later a baggage train of the king was captured and delivered to Warwick.\nWith further unrest both sides prepared for war, the smiths of Birmingham were called upon and over 15,000 sword blades were manufactured, these were supplied to Parliamentarian forces only.\n\nKings Norton and Hawksley both acted as battlefields during October, Prince Rupert's troops were ambushed with many casualties, although both sides claimed the upper hand (see Battle of Kings Norton).\nIn March 1643 Prince Rupert in command of about 1,900 men requested entry to the unfortified town which was refused by about 200 towns folk and a company of Roundheads from the garrison at Lichfield under the command of Captain Richard Greaves. The Battle of Camp Hill started with a direct assault by the Cavaliers on the earthworks at Camp Hill, after being twice repulsed the Cavaliers captured the earthworks by launching flanking attack with their cavalry. The Cavaliers pursued the fleeing townsmen into Birmingham where they came under fire from some houses, which they torched. At the far end of the town at Cape Hill the Roundhead troopers charged and successfully checked the Cavaliers, killing their officer William, Earl of Denbigh, and allowing Graves and his men to retreat unmolested back to Lichfield.\n\nThe laws of war at that time allowed for the burning of property in an undefended (unfortified) town of village if soldiers were shot at from those properties. Those houses from which shooting was thought to originate were set on fire by the Royalists, the inhabitants of whom were not allowed to quench the fires or to recover their movable possessions. About 80 houses were \"burnt to ashes\" (some of which belonged to Royalist sympathises), and some 15 men, and two women were killed, with many more wounded and left destitute. The Historian Trevor Royal writing in 2004 states \"By laying waste to the town and setting fire to many of its houses, Rupert's force provided parliament with a propaganda coup ... Charles rebuked Rupert for his men's behaviour — the prince had in fact done his best to curb his men ... but the damage was done: Birmingham had paid the price for supporting parliament and being seen to profit from it\".\n\nBirmingham, continued to manufacture weapons of all kinds during this period and was heavily relied upon by Parliamentary armies for such wares. It remained on the borders between the largely Cavalier garrisoned Worcestershire and Roundhead garrisoned Warwickshire. Colonel Tinker Fox operated from Edgbaston House close to Birmingham and probably took place in the attack on Aston Hall on 28 December 1643, removing the main royalist base in the Birmingham. He and his garrison actively raided into Worcestershire during the First Civil War. Perhaps his most famous exploit was a commando style raid on Bewdley which resulted in the capture of Sir Thomas Lyttelton its governor.\n\nBy the last quarter of the 17th century, the population of Birmingham was somewhere between 4,000 and 15,000. Birmingham's small arms manufacture continued and during the mid-to-late 17th century Birmingham smiths were renowned for their manufacture of quality weapons (Alexander Missen in his \"Travels\" on visiting Milan noted that \"fine works of rock-crystal, swords, heads of canes, snuffboxes, and other fine works of steel\" could be purchased in Milan but that \"they can be had better and cheaper in Birmingham\"). There is no evidence that firearms were manufactured in Birmingham until the 1690s when the Office of Ordinance issued a warrant to \"pay John Smart for Thomas Hadley, and the rest of the Gunmakers of Birmingham, one debenture of four-score and sixteen pounds eight shillings, dated ye 14th of July 1690\", but it is unlikely that guns were not manufactured in Birmingham before that date. It is more likely that when Sir Richard Newdigate approached manufacturers in the town in 1689 with the notion of supplying the British Government with small arms, it was important that they would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in 1692, the Government placed its first contract. On 5 January 1693 the \"Officers of Ordnance\" chose five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 \"snaphance musquets\" per month over the period of one year, paying 17 shillings per musket, plus 3 shillings per hundredweight for delivery to London.\n\nGun manufacture in Birmingham continued to develop, mainly around the Digbeth area but also in what was later to become known as the Gun Quarter.\n\nA meeting was held 5 October 1745, by the 6th Regiment of Foot for the raising of a regiment of volunteers to oppose The '45 Jacobite rebellion.\n\nThe town contributed to a fund to repel the rumoured invasion by France in 1758.\n\nThe 6th Regiment of Foot recruited in the county of Warwickshire in 1778 so successfully that it was called \"The Warwickshire,\" Birmingham supplying a large proportion of the men, and raising by public subscription £2,000 towards their equipment.\n\nIn August 1782 a corps was organised in 1782, but it must have disbanded soon afterwards. When, as an aid to recruiting, territorial links to infantry regiments were first established in 1782, the 6th became the 1st Warwickshire Regiment, reflecting their recent connections with the county. During the French Revolutionary Wars in 1794 in the West Indies, the 6th took part in the capture of Martinique, Guadeloupe and St Lucia from the French and in Casdebar in August 1798 they gained a Battle Honour.\n\nIn 1798 when it seemed that revolution might break out two companies of cavalry and one of infantry were raised, each one 500 strong under the command of Captain Pearson and Lord Broke. They were called the Birmingham Loyal Association of Volunteers and held their first parade on Coleshill Street on 15 August 1797. The infantry were armed with muskets brought from Prussia. The Loyal Association held their first parade in Coleshill Street, 15 August 1797. On 4 June 1798, a grand review was held on Birmingham Heath (then unenclosed), \"to the delight of the local belles, who knew not which the most to admire, the scarlet horse or the blue foot\". Over 100,000 spectators were said to have been present.\n\nWith the many gunmakers and workshops the quality of gun manufacture in the town needed to be controlled. Government viewing rooms were opened in Bagot Street in 1798, employing sixty or seventy people to ensure that guns produced were of the necessary standard to provide for the British army. Military use, however, was accompanied by a major market in the Atlantic slave trade. A 1788 Parliamentary report counted over 4,000 gun makers, with 100,000 guns a year going to slave traders.\n\nThe Birmingham Volunteers had the honour of escorting Lord Nelson when, with Lady Hamilton, he visited the town in 1802. At a review on 2 August 1804, the regiment were presented with its colours, and for years the \"Loyals\" were the most popular men of the period.\n\nThe Handsworth Volunteer Cavalry do not seem to have been more backward than the Birmingham Volunteers, though why it was necessary that the services of the Handsworth Cavalry should be required to charge and put to flight the rioters in Snow Hill on 29 May 1810 is not very clear.\n\nDuddeston Barracks were built in 1793, at a cost of £13,000, as a consequence of the riots of the city in 1791.\n\nIn 1809, a statue of Lord Nelson was opened in the Bull Ring, in memory of the men who died in the battle of Trafalgar in 1805.\n\nBoulton struck a line medal in commemoration of the Battle of Trafalgar, and by permission of the Government gave one to every person who took part in the action; flag-officers and commanders receiving copies in gold, lieutenants, &c., in silver, and the men, bronze. Being struck for this purpose only, and not for sale, the medal is very scarce.\n\nThe services of the Handsworth Volunteer Cavalry were required to charge and put to flight the rioters in Snow Hill on 29 May 1810.\n\nThe Orsim bombs used in Paris, 15 January 1858, were made in the city.\n\nThe official Natal Day could be argued as 14 December 1859, when a town's meeting was held \"for the purpose of adopting such measures as might seem desirable for placing Birmingham in its proper position with regard to the great national rifle movement\". The Hon. Charles Granville Scott had been previously selected by Lord Leigh (the Lord-Lieutenant of the County) as Colonel, Major Sanders had accepted the Captaincy, Mr. J.O. Mason been appointed Lieutenant, and 111 names entered on the roll of members of the 1st Company, but it was not until the above-named day that the movement really made progress, the Mayor (Mr. Thos. Lloyd), Sir John Ratcliff, Mr. A. Dixon, and Mr. J. Lloyd each then promising to equip his twenty men apiece, and sundry other gentlemen aiding to dress up others of the rank and file.\n\nThe money thus being found the men were soon forthcoming too, the end of the year showing 320 names on the roll call, a number increased to 1,080 by the close of 1860. The latter year saw the first parade in Calthorpe Park, the opening of the range at Bournbrook, and the formation of the twelve companies forming the first battalion, but, notwithstanding many liberal donations (the gunmakers giving £850), and the proceeds of the first annual ball, it closed with the corps being in debt by over £1,000. On the formation of the 2nd county battalion, Col. Scott took command thereof, Major Sanders being promoted. He was followed by Lieut.-Col. Mason, on whose resignation, in February 1867, Major Ratcliff succeeded, the battalion being then 1,161 strong. Col. Ratcliff retired in June 1871, and was replaced by Major-General Hinde, C.B., who held command until his death, 1 March 1881. Major Gem who temporarily acted as commander, also died the following 4 November (1881), Major Burt filling the post until the appointment of Col. W. Swynfen Jervis. The first adjutant (appointed in 1860) was Captain McInnis, who retired in 1870, having received bodily injuries through being thrown from his horse; he was succeeded by Adjutant-Colonel Tarte.\n\nThe first uniform of the corps was a grey tunic with green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this was changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn by the 60th Rifles, with the exception of a broad red stripe on the trousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the cap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in 1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon perhaps our boys will all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the Staffordshire battalions. The annual balls did not become popular, the last taking place in 1864; bazaars were held 14–17 October 1863, and 24–27 October 1876; athletic displays had been given (the first in May 1865).\n\nAt the Volunteer Review, 24 July 1861, before the Duke of Cambridge; at the Hyde Park Review, June 1865, before the Prince of Wales; at the Midland Counties' Review at Derby, June 1867; at the Royal Review at Windsor in 1868; and at every inspection since, the Birmingham corps has merited and received the highest praise for general smartness and efficiency; it was one of the crack corps of the kingdom.\n\nThe first march-out of 720 to Sutton took place 21 June 1875, others joining at the camp, making over 800 being under canvas, 744 attending the review. The camping-out at Streetly Wood had annually recurred since that date; the first sham fight took place 20 June 1877. The \"coming-of-age\" was celebrated by a dinner at the Midland Hotel, 29 January 1881, up to which point the Government grants had amounted to £26,568 14 s (£26,568.70), the local subscriptions to £8,780, and the donations to £1,956 1 s 3 d (£1,956.06) The Birmingham Rifle Corps is now recognised as the First Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, having been linked to the \"Saucy Sixth\", under the army scheme of 1873.\n\nThe Midland Rifle Club was started in 1875, the Staffordshire Rifle Association dating from 1861. Both clubs used the range at Sandwell Park, by permission of the Earl of Dartmouth. At the International Match at Creedmoor, New York, in 1881, the representatives of this neighbourhood scored high numbers, Corporal Bates (of the M.R.C.) taking the only first prize secured by visitors in the open competitions of the U.S. Associations.\n\nIn 1881 The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers were created drawing massively from the city's stock. The Royal Warwickshire Regiment reorganised as the county regiment of Warwickshire, encompassing also its Militia and Volunteer infantry.\n\nAround this time an official report showed that the Warwickshire regiment could muster 213 Yeomanry Cavalry on parade; while the Staffordshire had 422.\n\nThe Warwickshire regiment drew massively from the Birmingham area especially in the first world war, an initial recruitment drive in the city mustered over 8000 men to fight in British regiments. Due to the successful recruitment the government advertised again and subsequently recruited a further 4000 volunteers, initially named the 1st, 2nd and 3rd city battalion, they were later merged into The Royal Warwickshire Regiment. These forces later went on to fight in the trenches of the first world war.\n\nThe Company's post-war programme included, for a short time, a range of aeroplanes.\n\nThe Austin Greyhound 2 seater fighter was one, and the Austin Ball single seater another. Then there was a single seater biplane with folding wings, which sold at £500, and a fourth called the Austin Whippet.\n\nPercussion caps were yearly sent from Brum in millions of grosses, the manufacture of the complete gun cartridge came later.\n\nThe manufacture of the caps involved several dangerous processes, and Birmingham has had to mourn the loss of many of her children through accidents arising therefrom.\n\nThe ammunition works of Messrs. Kynoch and Co., at Witton, covered over 20 acres (80,000 m²), and gave employment to several hundred people, the contrariness of human nature being exemplified in the fact that the death-dealing articles were mainly manufactured by females, the future mothers or wives perchance of men to be laid low by the use of such things. The plant was capable of turning out 500,000 cartridges per day, as was done during the Turkish war, and it took 50 tons of rolled brass, 100 tons of lead, and 20 tons of gunpowder weekly to keep the factory fully going, all kinds of ammunition for rifles and machine guns being made on the premises. Other extensive works were those of the Birmingham Small Arms and Metal Co., at Adderley Park Mills, and the National Arms and Ammunition Co., at Small Heath, and Perry Barr.\n\nIn 1936 the government purchased a site next to the Castle Bromwich Aerodrome which was developed into Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory.\n\n1 September 1939 - Approximately 75,000 Birmingham school children were evacuated to make way for the Battle of Britain.\nOn 8 August 1940 the first air-raid on Birmingham took place over Erdington. During Birminghams 27 enemy air raids an official request by the Government to news editors not to publish such reports left the city's bereaved quite indignant and bitter.\n\nOver 2,000 women, children and elderly were killed and 3,000 more were seriously injured in the air raids, many of the attacks were aimed at the thousands of factories that manufactured weapons of war, including the Castle Bromwich aeroplane factory that mass-produced the Spitfire fighter aircraft. The longest raid took place on 11 December and lasted 13 hours, King George VI inspected damage the next day.\nFinally, 60 years after the end of the Second World War, a memorial is now in place by the new Bull Ring to commemorate the civilians who died during air raids, naming all those who were killed or gave up their lives protecting the city.\n\nB.S.A. and Longbridge turned their hands to the British war effort once again.\n\nThe Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers were absorbed in 1968 and were combined with the other 3 Fusilier Regiments (The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, The Lancashire Fusiliers and The Royal Fusiliers) to form the Royal Regiment Of Fusiliers.\n\nSelly Oak Hospital closed completely in 2012. All military personnel are now treated at the recently built Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham which is now the new home of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, which cares for injured service men and women from conflict zones, as well as training Army, Navy and Air Force medical staff.\n\nHMS Daring, the first Type 45 destroyer is affiliated to the city of Birmingham.\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n\n"}

He was president and chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. He was also an owner and chief executive officer of the Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe son of Marvin Glass and Myrtle Van Winkle, Glass was born on a farm in Oregon County, Missouri, and grew up in Mountain View, Missouri. He served in the United States Army from 1954 through 1956, then attended Missouri State University in Springfield.\n\nDavid Glass joined the company in 1976. In his position as Executive Vice President of Finance for Wal-Mart Stores, he administered the overall financial and accounting responsibilities of the company prior to his appointment as vice chairman and chief financial officer. He served in that role until 1984 when he was named president and Walmart’s chief operating officer. Along with Rob Walton, in 1985, Glass managed development of Retail Link program, Walmart's proprietary trend-forecasting software. In 1988, he was named Walmart's chief executive officer, stepping down from the position in January 2000. Glass was active in the company's growth from 123 stores in 1976 to its more than 4,000 nationally and internationally in 2005.\n\nGlass was named Retailer of the Year by members of the retail industry in 1986 and 1991 and was inducted into the Retail Hall of Fame in August 2000. Glass was also a member of the board of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. from 1976 until his death in 2020.\n\nGlass became the interim CEO and chairman of the Royals on September 23, 1993, following the death of the founding owner, Ewing Kauffman. Under Glass' leadership, the board cut the payroll from $41 million to $19 million. During the Major League Baseball strike of 1994–1995, Glass opposed any settlement with the players' union without a salary cap, and supported the use of strike-breaking \"replacement\" players, despite a court ruling that the use of replacement players violated federal labor law.\n\nOn April 18, 2000, Glass became sole owner of the Royals, purchasing the organization from the Kauffman estate for $96 million. The Royals board approved his offer despite a competing bid of $120 million by Miles Prentice. However, MLB rejected Prentice's offer because he did not have enough net worth to withstand substantial losses. With none of the area's wealthy families willing to even consider making a bid for the Royals—or any other existing or prospective professional team in Kansas City—Glass was the only credible bidder who was interested in keeping the team in town. An original stipulation of the sale was that any profits from Glass' sale of the Royals must go to charity, but that clause has since expired.\n\nFor much of his tenure as owner, Glass was criticized for bringing the same cost-cutting management style he used at Walmart to the Royals. While he garnered large profits, the Royals were barely competitive for most of the early part of the new millennium. Glass' management is cited for transforming the Royals from a perennial playoff contender in the 1970s and 1980s to one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nGlass created a controversy on June 9, 2006, by revoking the press credentials of two reporters who had earlier asked pointed questions to Royals management. The move to avoid criticism infuriated many within the press and led to a backlash of articles that extended far beyond the Kansas City sports community.\n\nThe Royals have had four winning seasons during his ownership: 2003, 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2014, the Royals won 89 games and reached the 2014 Major League Baseball Playoffs for the first time in 29 years. They advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1985. The Royals finished the following year with the best regular-season record in the American League, and a second consecutive victory in its championship series. The Royals then defeated the New York Mets in 5 games to win its first World Series championship since 1985.\n\nIn August 2019, Glass agreed to sell the team to Cleveland Indians vice chairman John Sherman, pending approval from Major League Baseball and its remaining owners. In November 2019, Glass officially sold the team to Sherman.\n\nGlass and his wife, Ruth, were the parents of three children, Dan, Don and Dayna, all of whom served on the Royals' board of directors.\n\nGlass died of complications from pneumonia in Bentonville, Arkansas, on January 9, 2020, at the age of 84. His death was announced on January 17.\n\nGlass Hall at Missouri State University, which houses business and management classes, is named after him.\n\n"}

The series ran for thirteen titles from 1991 to 1993, and were published by Simon & Schuster imprint Archway Paperbacks; like the previous three series, the series was written under the pseudonym Victor Appleton. Unlike the previous series, it was not created by the Stratemeyer Syndicate; by this time, the Syndicate had been sold to Simon & Schuster, who created the series in response to the successful, more mature spin-offs of Syndicate properties Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys.\n\nDaring, resourceful Tom Swift, Jr. is the teenage son of gifted scientist Tom Swift, Sr. and Mary Nestor. However, Tom is also gifted scientist and inventor in his own right, as is his sister Sandra. Tom, Sr. is the head of Swift Enterprises located in the Silicon Valley town of Jefferson, California (a departure from previous series, which were set in upstate New York), which is also where the Swifts live. Like the third series, an ethnically diverse cast of characters is featured, though the Swifts themselves are still White.\n\nAkin to the \"Files\" and \"Casefiles\" series, this series uses more violence and action. For example, in \"The Negative Zone\", Tom blows up a motel room to escape the authorities. Also unlike previous series, this series shows that Tom's genius can sometimes be problematic and dangerous; many of his inventions have unintended and negative consequences. In \"The DNA Disaster\", Tom inadvertently causes Devolution (biology) with his latest invention.\n\nIn 1985, the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster after the death of Harriet Adams three years earlier. Shortly afterwards, the publishers launched spin-offs of mainstays Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys with \"The Nancy Drew Files\" in 1986 and \"The Hardy Boys Casefiles\" in 1987. These series were aimed towards a more mature audience, and were successful; at their height, the series published a new title every month.\n\nIn 1990, Simon & Schuster decided to launch a fourth Tom Swift series, to capitalize on the success of the more mature spin-offs. However, unlike the \"Files\" and \"Casefiles\" series - which were handled by book packager Mega-Books, the new \"Tom Swift\" series was handled by Byron Preiss Visual Publications. Like he previous two Tom Swift series, this series' protagonist is Tom Swift, Jr., the son of Tom Swift, Sr. and Mary Nestor. However, this series combined elements from both \"Tom Swift Jr.\" and the 1980s \"Tom Swift\" series in making their new Tom Swift.\n\nUltimately, the new \"Tom Swift\" series struggled to match the success of its counterparts, even when a crossover spin-off of its own with the \"Casefiles\" series was launched. The series ended in 1993, with only thirteen titles being printed.\n\nThis was a spin-off crossover series with \"The Hardy Boys Casefiles\", similar to the \"Supermystery\" series (which was a crossover \"The Hardy Boys\" had with \"Nancy Drew\"). The Hardy Boys' Franklin W. Dixon pseudonym was the only one attributed to this series, though it was produced by Bryon Preiss.\n\n"}

Rustemagić (through Strip Art Features) represents artists such as Hermann Huppen, Bane Kerac, and Joe Kubert.\n\nHis personal plight, documented by telefax during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the theme of the award-winning nonfiction graphic novel \"Fax from Sarajevo\" by Joe Kubert.\n\nRustemagić founded \"Strip Art\" in 1971 at the age of 17, and founded Strip Art Features in 1972. \"Strip Art\" won the of Lucca Comics & Games as Best Foreign Comics Publisher in 1984.\n\nWith the beginning of the Bosnian War in early 1992, Rustemagić's home and the SAF offices in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidža were destroyed. More than 14,000 pieces of original art were lost in the flames, including pieces by Americans Hal Foster, Doug Wildey, Joe Kubert, Warren Tufts, Sergio Aragonés, George McManus, Alex Raymond, Charles M.

Some months later, in October 1992, the family moved locations to the Sarajevo Holiday Inn, at that point mostly occupied by foreign journalists and constantly under fire. Thanks to help from European publishers and artists, in late 1993 Rustemagić gained journalist accreditation, enabling him to escape Bosnia and Herzegovina. After more than a month fruitlessly attempting to get his family out of the country, he was given Slovenian citizenship, which immediately transferred to his family. In September 1993 the family was reunited in Split, Croatia.

He started to learn Go at 7. Dōsaku was so strong by the time he was in his early 20s that even if someone played the first move, he would always win.

The ground for this decision was the match of 20 games played between Hon'inbō Dōetsu and Sanchi, for which Dōsaku probably acted as Dōetsu's second on adjournments.\n\nBy the time he was 32, he was already head of the Hon'inbō school and placed at the top of the official hierarchy. It has been suggested that the true level of his playing strength was never really tested, given the distance between him and his nearest rivals. The evidence of his contributions is in the legacy of games, known to us by the kifu records.\n\nTwo of his famous games are the Jan. 5th, 1684 defeat by one point in a two-stone game (his \"life-time masterpiece\") and the 1670 castle go game when his opponent opened at \"tengen\", the central point, which was a victory. These were both against members of the Yasui house. Over 150 games of his are known.\n\nDōsaku is also well remembered for his contributions to Go theory. He took advantage of overconcentration also known as \"korigatachi\", making that henceforth one of the key theoretical errors that players avoided. \"Tewari\" analysis, a systematic if rather tricky tool of analysis of efficiency of sequences, is also attributed to him; as is the strategy of \"amashi\".\n\nIn playing Peichin Hamahika from the Ryukyu Islands, in 1682, he gave a practical demonstration of his theories, winning easily when giving a four-stone handicap. This game is a textbook piece and is still frequently cited. (The first game he won by 14; the second game on the same day was also recorded and he lost by a small margin, which may naturally mean that he had nothing to prove and was being diplomatic.)\n\nIn the field of \"joseki\", he innovated with the three-point low pincer, a more strategic play than the two-point low pincer favoured in particular by the players of the Yasui house.\n\nHe taught Ogawa Dōteki, Sayama Sakugen, Hoshiai Hasseki, Kumagaya Honseki, and Kuwabara Dōsetsu. All but one died young, in their early twenties, and the Honinbo house faced a period of rebuilding. Dōsetsu became the Inoue house head. The young Hon'inbō Dōchi carried on the tradition.\n\n"}

His father Đorđe Grabež was a Serbian Orthodox priest. At the age of seventeen, Grabež was expelled from school for striking one of his teachers.\n\nGrabež left home and moved to Belgrade, which was a part of the Kingdom of Serbia at the time. As well as continuing his education he joined the Black Hand secret society. For the next two years he spent most of his spare time with other nationalists who favoured a union between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.\n\nWhen it was announced that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the throne of Austro-Hungarian Empire, was going to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 1914, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, the chief of the Intelligence Department in the Serbian Army and head of the Black Hand, sent seven men, Grabež, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Vaso Čubrilović, Cvjetko Popović, Danilo Ilić, Muhamed Mehmedbašić and Gavrilo Princip to Sarajevo to assassinate him.\n\nEach man was given either a revolver or a bomb and a small vial of cyanide. They were instructed to commit suicide after Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been killed. It was important to Colonel Dimitrijević that the men did not have the opportunity to confess who had organised the assassination.\n\nGrabež, Nedjelko Čabrinović, and Gavrilo Princip, were all suffering from tuberculosis and knew they would not live long and the other four men hated Franz Ferdinand. They were therefore willing to give their life for what they believed was a great cause: Bosnia and Herzegovina achieving independence from Austro-Hungary.\n\nNikola Pašić, the prime minister of Serbia, heard about the plot and gave instructions for Grabež, Princip and Čabrinović to be arrested when they attempted to leave the country. However, his orders were not implemented and they managed to reach Bosnia and Herzegovina where they joined forces with fellow conspirators, Vaso and Veljko Čubrilović, Muhamed Mehmedbašić, Danilo Ilić and Cvijetko Popović.\n\nOn Sunday, 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie von Chotkovato arrived in Sarajevo by train. General Oskar Potiorek, Governor of the Austrian provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was waiting to take the royal party to the City Hall for the official reception.\n\nIn the front car was Fehim Čurčić, the Mayor of Sarajevo and Dr. Gerde, the city's Commissioner of Police. Franz Ferdinand and Sophie von Chotkovato were in the second car with Oskar Potiorek and Count von Harrach. The cars' top was rolled back in order to allow the crowds a good view of its occupants. The seven members of the Black Hand group also lined the route. They were spaced out along the Appel Quay, each one had been instructed to try to kill Franz Ferdinand when the royal car reached his position. The first conspirator on the route to see the royal car was Muhamed Mehmedbašić. Standing by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, Mehmedbašić allowed the car to pass and failed to take action. Mehmedbašić later said that a policeman was standing behind him and feared he would be arrested before he had a chance to throw his bomb.\n\nNedjelko Čabrinović, the next man on the route, hurled his hand grenade at the archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards him and the grenade exploded under the wheel of the next car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Boos-Waldeck were seriously wounded. About a dozen spectators were also hit by bomb shrapnel.\n\nLater that day, Gavrilo Princip managed to kill both Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg. Princip and Nedeljko Čabrinović were interrogated by the police. They kept to the promise to not tell anyone. Muhamed Mehmedbašić managed to escape to Serbia but Grabež, Popović and the Čubrilović's were arrested and charged with treason and murder after Danilo Ilić told the police. The police went round and investigated random people in order to identify potential accomplices. Once they spoke to Ilić, he lost his nerve and spilled the beans.\n\nAll seven of the men charged with treason and the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand were convicted. Under Austro-Hungarian law, capital punishment could not be imposed on someone who was under the age of 20 when they had committed the crime. Grabež and most of the others therefore received the maximum penalty of twenty years in prison.\n\nGrabež died of tuberculosis on 21 October 1916, aged 21.\n\n"}

{"id": "1915525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915525", "title": "Clyde Cessna", "text": "Clyde Cessna\n\nClyde Vernon Cessna (; December 5, 1879 – November 20, 1954) was an American aircraft designer, aviator, and early aviation entrepreneur. He is best known as the principal founder of the Cessna Aircraft Corporation.\n\nCessna was born on December 5, 1879, in Hawthorne, in Montgomery County, Iowa, the son of Mary Vandora (Skates) and James William Cessna. Cessna's family was of French and German ancestry. When he was two years old, his family moved to rural Rago in Kingman County, Kansas, along the Chikaskia River. During his boyhood he used his self-taught innovation and mechanical skills to improve farm machinery and to develop new farming methods. He later became a successful car dealer in Enid, Oklahoma.\n\nCessna's interest in aviation began in 1910 after witnessing an aerial exhibition in his home state of Kansas. It was this exhibition that led him in future years to pursue his career in aviation. After realizing his interest in aviation, Cessna left Oklahoma and moved to New York State where he worked for a short period at the Queen Aeroplane Company where he first learned about the construction of aircraft.\n\nIn 1911, he set out to build his first airplane, an airplane he named \"Silverwing\". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the \"aero special\", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of and 1,050 rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, \"I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm going to set it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!\". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a \"daring hero\" and nicknamed him the \"Birdman of Enid\". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly over the next several months until December 1911, when he made a successful flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAfter the success of the Silverwing, Cessna permanently quit his work with the automobile industry to pursue his interests in aviation. Between 1912 and 1915, Cessna developed several new monoplanes, all powered by an Anzani 6-cylinder with 40–60 hp. During this time, Clyde often flew his aircraft at holiday events and county fairs, an endeavour that at the time proved to be lucrative.\nIt was in 1916 that Clyde acquired a vacant building to begin building a new aircraft for the 1917 aviation exhibition season. His factory served a dual purpose, as he also opened a flight school in which he enrolled five student pilots. However, in April 1917 when the United States declared war, the exhibition flying market ground to a halt. With his primary source of income grounded, Clyde returned to his old home near Rago, Kansas, where he resumed his duties on the family farm.\n\nIn the years following World War I public interest in private flying increased, leading Cessna in 1925, along with Walter Beech and Lloyd Stearman, to found the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita, Kansas. While Cessna was president, the company soon became one of the leading US aircraft manufacturers. This success can be attributed to Cessna's advanced design concepts, creating aircraft that attained international recognition, while establishing numerous speed and distance records. After two years, Cessna left the company with plans to start his own firm, due to disputes with his partners over the monoplane design or the biplane design.\n\nOn September 7, 1927, Cessna and aviation entrepreneur Victor Roos paired to form Cessna-Roos Aircraft. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership, selling back his interest to Cessna, and the company changed its name to Cessna Aircraft Corporation in December. In the later part of 1927, Cessna struggled to design and build an efficient monoplane. The AW was completed near the end of 1927.\n\nCessna followed the AW with the CW-6, which flew in 1928, and the DC-6, which flew in 1929. He then collaborated with his son, Eldon, in designing and flying the CR-series racing aircraft.\n\nDespite the success of new models, the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in aircraft sales, a bankruptcy filing for the corporation, and the complete closure of the company in 1931. In 1934, Cessna reopened his Wichita plant, which he soon sold to his nephews—aeronautical engineer Dwane Wallace and his brother, attorney Dwight Wallace—in 1936.\n\nAfter turning over the Cessna Aircraft Corporation to his nephews, Dwane and Dwight Wallace, Cessna returned to a life of farming. Clyde operated an early diesel three-track tractor building ponds for local farmers. Upon Dwane's request, he agreed to participate in the company but served mostly in a ceremonial capacity and stayed out of the company's day-to-day business.\n\nHe died on November 20, 1954, at the age of 74 in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nCessna was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1978 and the International Air & Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was ranked number 27 on \"Flying\" magazine's list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation in 2013. The Kingman Airport – Clyde Cessna Field in Kingman, Kansas is named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

His family performed in a variety of acts with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus where he learned comedy in the vaudeville style. He worked as a circus aerialist, comedy acrobat, and clown. Later, he formed a group that toured the country during winters when the circus was not operating.\n\nAudiences at shows put on by the troupe were often quite hostile toward the performers. After years of trying to appease the crowds with traditional performance styles, Riggs began to request input from them. As an example, he might ask \"Who do you hate in this town?\" If the audience replied, \"the mayor,\" the performers would quickly improvise a scene about the mayor. However, at the time, \"improvisation\" was a word primarily used to describe the actions of jazz musicians. Riggs was an admirer of jazz and avoided using the term himself, preferring the phrase \"instant theater.\" Later, a \"New York Times\" critic called Riggs' performances \"word jazz,\" while members of the Second City troupe visiting in the 1960s and 1970s referred to the shows as \"spot improv.\"\n\nOne year, the booking agent for the troupe stated that he couldn't find anyplace willing to take the performers. In order to keep skills strong, Riggs rented a street-level space in New York City where group members could practice. People walking by could see what was going on by looking through the window, and passers-by soon began to offer money to watch rehearsals. Riggs began the Instant Theater Company in New York, which ran from 1954 to 1958.\n\nThe famous critic Walter Kerr was an early attendee, and was amazed by what he saw. He held off writing a review for three weeks because he couldn't believe that the performers were actually taking in the audience's ideas—Kerr was convinced that group members were calling upon accomplices for input and were using pre-arranged material. After realizing the authenticity of performances, he wrote a glowing review.\nRiggs' improv group began touring before eventually settling in Minneapolis in 1958. Here, Riggs founded the Cafe Espresso on East Hennepin Avenue, where he operated the first espresso machine in the state while also providing a home for Instant Theater Company. After the café moved to South Hennepin in Uptown in 1965, claims of \"the first espresso machine west of the Mississippi River\" were also made. By 1961 the name was finally changed to Brave New Workshop.\n\nIn 1971, Riggs opened the Experimental Theater Company (E.T.C.) in the Seven Corners area of Minneapolis, next to the University of Minnesota. This theater provided a wider range of material including comedy, variety shows, and specialty acts.\n\nA number of famous performers started at the Brave New Workshop, including regional natives Louie Anderson and Al Franken, and writers such as Pat Proft, television executive producer Linda Wallem, and scriptwriter and producer/director Peter Tolan.\n\nThere was some sharing of experience and technique between BNW and Second City in Chicago. Del Close worked with Riggs for a time, and members of both troupes were regulars at each other's shows when traveling.\n\nAfter operating it for 39 years, Riggs sold the Brave New Workshop in 1997 to Mark Bergen, John Sweeney and Jenni Lilledahl, though Bergen eventually moved on to other projects. Sweeney and Lilledahl still operate the theater and have made some changes. Their focus is more on long-form improvisation, while Riggs had always been more focused on shorter individual sketches.\n\nIn 2017, the University of Minnesota Press published Riggs's memoir \"Flying Funny: My Life Without a Net\".\nThe memoir focuses on his early life in the circus and vaudeville, and the early development of improv, since the books \"Brave New Workshop\" by Ron Hubbard and \"Promiscuous Comedy\" by Irv Letofsky covered some later developments.\n\n"}

It was Nikon's first DSLR aimed at the consumer market, and sold for US$899. It uses the Nikon F mount. The D50 was succeeded by the Nikon D40 in November 2006.\n\nIt has a 23.7 mm by 15.6 mm DX format image sensor with 6.1 million effective pixels. It also has a 2.0\" (50 mm) polysilicon TFT LCD with 130,000 pixels. The camera uses a through-the-lens full-aperture exposure metering system. It can simultaneously record NEF and JPEG data to a Secure Digital storage device. Like its newer, higher-end sibling (the D80), the D50 uses Secure Digital instead of CompactFlash cards found on previous Nikon digital SLRs. The camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery which is claimed to be able to take up to 2,000 shots on a single charge. The camera is compatible with PictBridge printers and can shoot 2.5 frames per second in continuous mode. The camera's dimensions are 133 mm in width, 102 mm in height, and 76 mm in depth.\n\nThe D50 is the only entry-level Nikon DSLR to have the autofocus motor ('screw drive') built into the camera body, making the camera backwards-compatible with mechanical-drive autofocus lenses (Nikkor AF series) dating back to 1989. This feature has been eliminated on later entry-level models and is currently only available on mid-range and advanced models. This makes the D50 the lightest Nikon DSLR to have the autofocus motor.\n\nThis camera has many settings that can only be accessed by selecting a detailed menu view. One such feature is the ability to a make series of differently-exposed images for processing into HDRI photographs. The camera menu refers to this setting as BKT (Bracketed Set).\n\nThe D50 was announced on April 20, 2005 and went on sale in June 2005. When introduced, the camera carried a suggested retail price of US$799 for the body only or $899 with a new 18-55 mm F3.5-5.6 G AF-S DX lens. Another variant of the D50 kit containing both the 18–55 mm and a 55–200 mm F4-5.6 G AF-S DX lens was available. Competitors of the D50 included the Canon EOS 350D, the Pentax *ist DS, the Konica Minolta Dynax 5D, and the Olympus E-300. \n\nThe website Digital Photography Review rated the D50 highly and noted its improved noise performance over the D70s it was largely derived from, although it had fewer hobbyist features (making the D50 the first de-specified entry-level DSLR camera thus lowering the MSRP) and a lower price than the D70s. In depth testing by the Images Resources website and the October 2005 \"Hoshi Nabi\" (Star Navigator) Magazine, indicated that the D50 achieved its low noise through exceptionally good performance at the sensor level. Testing by Roger Clark confirmed that the D50 had higher gain and lower noise than the D70. Tests of the D50 at all ISO levels indicated that it did offer low noise without loss of contrast or detail.\n\n"}

He became a member of Mlada Bosna (\"Young Bosnia\"). He recruited Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Vaso Čubrilović, Trifko Grabež, Muhamed Mehmedbašić, and Cvjetko Popović to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which led directly to World War I.

Ilić, Veljko Čubrilovic and Miško Jovanović, who helped the assassins kill the royal couple, were executed at the Sarajevo barracks on 3 February 1915.\n"}

As of September 2019, it has been ratified by 45 states.\n\nBased on the CMR, the International Road Transport Union (IRU) developed a standard CMR waybill. The CMR waybill is prepared in three languages. On the back is the text again in three languages. This aids the waybill in being accepted and recognised throughout Europe. Checked by customs and police, a transport document must be present when the shipment is transported. The document itself is not prescribed; there is a minimum of information required on the CMR.

{"id": "1915560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915560", "title": "Black Widow (Claire Voyant)", "text": "Black Widow (Claire Voyant)\n\nBlack Widow (Claire Voyant) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Claire Voyant is a medium who is murdered and becomes \"Satan's ambassador\" on Earth, killing evildoers in order to deliver their souls to her master. She first appears in \"Mystic Comics\" #4 (cover dated Aug. 1940), published by Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Created by writer George Kapitan and artist Harry Sahle, she is unrelated to Marvel's later superspy character called Black Widow.\n\nThe Black Widow makes five appearances during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of comic books, all five written by George Kapitan. These short comics stories (the longest is eight pages, the shortest five) are spread among three different Timely anthology titles over a three-year period from 1940 to 1943.\n\nMadame Claire Voyant is introduced in \"Mystic Comics\" #4 as \"the strangest, most terrifying character in action picture magazines — the Black Widow. You've heard of the black widow spider — that evil creature whose bite spells doom. Now start the adventures of another black widow — a human tool of Satan whose very touch means death.\" Both \"Mystic Comics\" #4 and #5 (Aug. 1940, Mar. 1941) feature artwork by Harry Sahle (the stories are \"Introducing the Black Widow\", 7 pages, and \"Garvey Lang\", 8 pages, respectively). Another \"Mystic Comics\" appearance in issue #7 (Dec. 1941) has art by Stan Drake (\"Lewis & Sykes\", 5 pages). \"USA Comics\" #5 (Summer 1942) is penciled by Mike Sekowsky and inked by George Klein (\"Murder Unlimited\", 5 pages). Her final Golden Age appearance in \"All Select Comics\" #1 (Fall 1943) has art tentatively attributed to Drake (\"Blood Money\", 5 pages); this story is reprinted in 1974, along with the rest of the issue, by publisher Alan L. Light's company Flashback as \"Special Edition Reprints\" #14.\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", \"The Black Widow can kill with a touch and has other, Satan-derived, plot device powers. The wrongdoers she goes after are ordinary humans, although one group of them call themselves Murder, Unlimited and another is the Cult of the Black Widow Spiders.\"\n\nHer next appearance occurs 51 years later, in a flashback cameo in one panel of issue #1 (Jan. 1994) of the mini-series \"Marvels\" (\"A Time of Marvels\", written by Kurt Busiek with art by Alex Ross), and again eleven years later (Feb. 2005), also in brief flashback, in \"Marvel Knights Spider-Man\" #9 (\"The Last Stand\", written by Mark Millar with art by Terry and Rachel Dodson).\n\nThe Black Widow returns, finally in full-length stories, albeit as part of an ensemble cast, beginning in 2008 in \"The Twelve\" (written by J. Michael Straczynski with art by Chris Weston). The character appears in all 12 issues of \"The Twelve\", in addition to a one-shot titled \"The Twelve: Spearhead.\"\n\nIn 1940, Claire Voyant is a spirit medium who communicates with the dead through supernatural means. While serving a family named the Waglers, she is possessed by Satan to put a curse on them. James, a member of that family, survives a subsequent car crash provoked by the spell and, upon returning to Claire's quarters, guns her down.\n\nVoyant's soul goes to Hell, where Satan dresses her in her Black Widow costume. He also gives her the power to kill with a single touch of her fingers to the head (which leaves a branded \"Black Widow mark\") and other mystical tricks. Satan (who, daringly for the time, is discreetly depicted as nude but for his cape) sends her back to Earth to avenge her death. After killing her murderer, she returns to Satan who, no longer content to wait for evil souls to die a natural death and perhaps repent their sins in the interim, charges her with bringing those souls to him. \"On the upper world are mortal creatures whose hearts are blackened with wickedness and corruption. You, the Black Widow, will bring their evil souls to me!\"\n\nShe later kills corrupt arms manufacturers, crime boss Garvey Lang, members of a syndicate called Murder Unlimited and the villain Ogor, while also healing Ogor's victim.\n\nIn \"Marvels\", she is shown in flashback as part of a group of Timely's Golden Age characters aiding the Invaders against the Nazis.\n\nIn \"The Twelve\", Claire Voyant is retconned as becoming the Black Widow in 1928 after her sister is murdered. Standing over her sister's grave, she wishes for the power to avenge herself against the killer, and Satan responds.\n\nRevived in the present day, along with 11 other heroes, after being in suspended animation since World War II, she recommences serving as an \"instrument of vengeance\" for an initially unidentified entity (though never actually referred to as Satan, the Black Widow's master is identified as \"the devil\" in later issues) and going on missions for that party.\n\nA recurrent character trait of the Black Widow in her Golden Age appearances is that she shows no hesitation or mercy when it comes to killing her victims, and no apparent remorse over depriving them of their lives and sending their souls to Hell for eternal torment. Whether this ruthless aspect of her personality is original to Claire Voyant or a result of her resurrection by Satan as the Black Widow is unclear. (In her modern-day appearances in \"The Twelve\" she is much less a willing killer, and is shown crying after killing.)\n\nIn Golden Age appearances she does possess great compassion for those she perceives as innocent victims of evil, and a willingness to use her powers to protect and even heal them. This is shown most clearly in her fifth and last Golden Age appearance, in \"All Select Comics\" #1, when she is sent by Satan to harvest the soul of Ogor, a charlatan faith healer who has been stealing money from those who come to him for cures. After confronting Ogor and causing his death – he instantly dies of fright and heart failure rather than the Black Widow’s signature death touch, though the result is the same and his blackened soul goes instantly to Hell – she then takes the time, and uses her powers, to regenerate the amputated leg of a young boy named Pepito, whom Ogor had promised to heal.\n\nDuring her five brief appearances in the Golden Age, the Black Widow wears four distinctly different costumes, with different designs and different color schemes, and has three different hair colors.\n\nAppearing only in \"Mystic Comics\" #4, her first costume consists of a purple bodysuit with spider design on the belly, a green-and-blue striped cape, and red boots with yellow flame designs around the tops.\n\nFor her second appearance in \"Mystic Comics\" #5, the red boots with yellow flame trim survive; however, the bodysuit becomes plain black with no spider design, and the color of her cape changes to solid red.\n\nIn \"Mystic Comics\" #7 the color scheme and basic layout of the costume remain the same; however, the bodysuit acquires dark blue highlights, and the red cape now has flame designs around its hem. Both the \"flames\" and the cape itself are the same shade of red. Though highly similar to the costume in \"Mystic Comics\" #5, it is different in its particulars. The cape is held in place with a circular, gold-colored pin inset with a death’s head skull. Her hair remains blond for all three \"Mystic Comics\" appearances.\n\nIn \"USA Comics\" #5, the costume changes radically. The outfit's colors are now red, white and blue. The costume itself consists of a bright red bodysuit, a cape (colored either white or blue depending on the panel in question) with upturned Peter Pan collar, and white buccaneer boots. Her hair is now pure white.\n\nFor her final Golden Age appearance, in \"All Select Comics\" #1, the costume morphs into a blue bodysuit that, unlike any of her previous outfits, covers her legs as well as torso and arms, and a yellow cape. The boots with flame trim return, however both the boots and \"flames\" are yellow. The Black Widow is now a redhead.\n\nThroughout the majority of \"The Twelve\" she wears a fifth outfit, a minor redesign of the first, consisting of a dark purple bodysuit with, in a lighter shade of purple, a spider design on the belly. Her boots are the same dark purple as the bodysuit, with no \"flames\"; the cape is light purple, and likewise has no flame trim. In issue #12, the finale, she wears a sixth costume, which is gray, covers her entire body except head and hands, and features a fine spiderweb pattern over much of its surface.\n\nIntroduced in \"Mystic Comics\" #4 (Aug. 1940), the Black Widow is comic books' first costumed, superpowered female character. While John Giunta and Malcolm Kildale's Magician from Mars, who is superpowered, debuted earlier, in \"Amazing Man Comics\" #7 (Nov. 1939), as did writer-artist Fletcher Hanks' Fantomah, who has a dual identity as well as superpowers, in Fiction House's \"Jungle Comics\" #1 (Feb. 1940), neither wears a distinctive costume. While The Woman In Red also predates her, debuting in Standard Comics' \"Thrilling Comics\" #2 (March 1940), that character has a distinctive costume but no superpowers. Russell Stamm's Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character with the superpower of invisibility, debuted in a newspaper comic strip, rather than a comic book, on June 3, 1940.\n\nBefore her transformation into the Black Widow, Claire Voyant has undefined psychic powers enabling her to communicate with the spirits of the dead. Resurrected by Satan after her murder, the Black Widow has been granted supernatural powers allowing her to harvest the souls of evildoers for her master. She is able to teleport between Hell and the mortal world. Having already died, she is apparently immune to further attempts to kill her. In three separate Golden Age appearances, she is shot repeatedly and the bullets have no effect. She can mentally plant suggestions in the minds of others, possesses superhuman strength of an undefined nature, enhanced endurance, flight, invisibility, appearance alteration, and the ability to regenerate or heal others mystically.\nShe also has a death touch power. When the Black Widow touches one of her victims on the forehead, there is a burst of flame, they are instantly struck dead and their soul is sent to Hell. At the same time a mark is left in the shape of a spider.\n\nIn her modern appearances in \"The Twelve\", she exhibits the ability to fly and superhuman strength sufficient to rip human bodies to pieces. Apparently she still possesses her death touch power; however, the only time she is shown attempting its use, it fails to work on a non-human target.\n\nSatan claims he has made her immortal. Within the context of \"The Twelve\" when Claire Voyant becomes the Black Widow in 1928 she appears to be in her mid-20s. When she goes into suspended animation, 17 years later, in 1945, she apparently has not aged at all. In this case, it seems the Prince of Lies may have told the truth.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1915570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915570", "title": "Abfraction", "text": "Abfraction\n\nAbfraction is a theoretical concept explaining a loss of tooth structure not caused by tooth decay (non-carious cervical lesions). It is suggested that these lesions are caused by forces placed on the teeth during biting, eating, chewing and grinding; the enamel, especially at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), undergoes large amounts of stress, causing micro fractures and tooth tissue loss. Abfraction appears to be a modern condition, with examples of non-carious cervical lesions in the archaeological record typically caused by other factors.\n\nAbfraction is a form of non-carious tooth tissue loss that occurs along the gingival margin. In other words, abfraction is a mechanical loss of tooth structure that is not caused by tooth decay, located along the gum line. There is theoretical evidence to support the concept of abfraction, but little experimental evidence exists.\n\nThe term abfraction was first published in 1991 in a journal article dedicated to distinguishing the lesion. The article was titled \"Abfractions: A New Classification of Hard Tissue Lesions of Teeth\" by John O. Grippo. This article introduced the definition of abfraction as a \"pathologic loss of hard tissue tooth substance caused by bio mechanical loading forces\". This article was the first to establish abfraction as a new form of lesion, differing from abrasion, attrition, and erosion.\n\nTooth tissue is gradually weakened causing tissue loss through fracture and chipping or successively worn away leaving a non-carious lesion on the tooth surface. These lesions occur in both the dentine and enamel of the tooth. These lesions generally occur around the cervical areas of the dentition.\n\nAbfraction lesions will generally occur in the region on the tooth where the greatest tensile stress is located. In statements such as these there is no comment on whether the lesions occur above or below the CEJ. One theory suggests that the abfraction lesions will only form above the CEJ. However, it is assumed that the abfraction lesions will occur anywhere in the cervical areas of affected teeth. It is important to note that studies supporting this configuration of abfraction lesions also state that when there is more than one abnormally large tensile stress on a tooth two or more abfraction lesions can result on the one surface.\n\nWhen looking at abfraction lesions there are generally three shapes in which they appear, appearing as either wedge, saucer or mixed patterns. Wedge and saucer shaped lesions are the most common, whereas mixed lesions are less frequently identified in the oral cavity. In reference to figure 1, wedge shaped lesions have the sharpest internal line angles and saucer/mixed shaped lesions are either smooth internally, or a variety.\n\nClinically, people with abfraction lesions can also present with tooth sensitivity in the associated areas. This occurs because as the abfration lesions appear, dentine/cementum is exposed. The dentine and cementum are less dense than tooth enamel and therefore more susceptible to sensation from thermal/mechanical sources.\n\nAs abfraction is still a controversial theory there are various ideas on what causes the lesions. Because of this controversy the true causes of abfraction also remain disputable. Researchers have proposed that abfraction is caused by forces on the tooth from the teeth touching together, occlusal forces, when chewing and swallowing. These lead to a concentration of stress and flexion at the area where the enamel and cementum meet (CEJ). This theoretical stress concentration and flexion over time causes the bonds in the enamel of the tooth to break down and either fracture or be worn away from other stressors such as erosion or abrasion. The people who initially proposed the theory of abfraction believe the occlusal forces alone cause the lesions without requiring the added abrasive components such as toothbrush and paste or erosion.\n\nIf teeth come together in a non-ideal bite the researchers state that this would create further stress in areas on the teeth. Teeth that come together too soon or come under more load than they are designed for could lead to abfraction lesions. The impacts of restorations on the chewing surfaces of the teeth being the incorrect height has also been raised as another factor adding to the stress at the CEJ.\n\nFurther research has shown that the normal occlusal forces from chewing and swallowing are not sufficient to cause the stress and flexion required to cause abfraction lesions. However, these studies have shown that the forces are sufficient in a person who grinds their teeth (bruxism). Several studies have suggested that it is more common among those who grind their teeth, as the forces are greater and of longer duration. Yet further studies have shown that these lesions do not always appear in people with bruxism and others without bruxism have these lesions.\n\nThere are other researchers who would state that occlusal forces have nothing to do with the lesions along the CEJ and that it is the result of abrasion from toothbrush with toothpaste that causes these lesions.\n\nBeing theoretical in nature there is more than one idea on how abfraction presents clinically in the mouth. One theory of its clinical features suggests that the lesions only form above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) (which is where the enamel and cementum meet on a tooth). If this is kept in mind, it serves as a platform for it to be distinguished from other non-carious lesions, such as tooth-brush abrasion.\n\nTreatment of abfraction lesions can be difficult due to the many possible causes. To provide the best treatment option the dental clinician must determine the level of activity and predict possible progression of the lesion. A No.12 scalpel is carefully used by the dental clinician to make a small indentation on the lesion, this is then closely monitored for changes. Loss of a scratch mark signifies that the lesion is active and progressing.\n\nIt is usually recommended when an abfraction lesion is less than 1 millimeter, monitoring at regular intervals is a sufficient treatment option. If there are concerns around aesthetics or clinical consequences such as dentinal hypersensitivity, a dental restoration (white filling) may be a suitable treatment option.\n\nAside from restoring the lesion, it is equally important to remove any other possible causative factors.\nAdjustments to the biting surfaces of the teeth alter the way the upper and lower teeth come together, this may assist by redirecting the occlusal load. The aim of this is to redirect the force of the load to the long axis of the tooth, therefore removing the stress on the lesion. This can also be achieved by altering the tooth surfaces such as cuspal inclines, reducing heavy contacts and removing premature contacts. If bruxism is a deemed a contributing factor an occlusal splint can be an effective treatment for eliminating the irregular forces placed on the tooth.\n\nAbfraction has been a controversial subject since its creation in 1991. This is due to the clinical presentation of the tooth loss, which often presents in a manner similar to that of abrasion or erosion. The major reasoning behind the controversy is the similarity of abfraction to other non carious lesions and the prevalence of multiple theories to potentially explain the lesion. One of the most prevalent theories is called \"the theory of non-carious cervical lesions\" which suggests that tooth flexion, occurring due to occlusion factors, impacts on the vulnerable area near the cementoenamel junction. This theory is not widely accepted among the professional community as it suggests that the only factor is occlusion. Many researchers argue that this is inaccurate as they contend that the abfraction lesion is a multifactorial (has many causative factors) lesion with other factors such as abrasion or erosion. This controversy around the causative factors, along with the recency of the lesion classification, are some of the reasons why many dental clinicians are looking at the lesion with some scepticism. More research is needed to fully clear up the controversy surrounding the abfraction lesion.\n\n\n"}

This is considered part of enterprise application integration in larger shops that use that term since applications are part of the boot image, and modify the boot image, in most desktop OS.\n\nWindows Vista includes tools for boot image control, displacing third party tools. Mac OS has always had more flexible handling of boot drives, simplifying control and reducing the need to move boot images around between drives. Increasingly, boot image control is a network operating system function. \n\nVery often a large computer vendor is required to explain in a bid in response to an RFP how they intend to simplify the purchaser's boot image control problems and the attendant service costs:\n\nThe total cost of ownership correlates strongly to the total number of different images, not the total number of computers, so this is a major cost concern. Three basic strategies are commonly advised:\n\nOrganizations that do not closely track, control and set common standards for, acquisition of new computer hardware, typically can only practice a thin client strategy.\n\nWhich strategy will reduce total cost of operations the most depends on several factors:\n\nWhile the departmental boot image strategy seems to be the most flexible, the complexity of creating and managing several large boot images, and determining when a department needs to upgrade its applications, can easily outweigh these. Especially if users object and try to subvert the discipline of waiting for a regular boot turn to upgrade all machines at once. If each user is allowed to do this on their own, then, the discipline soon degrades into effectively a bunch of home computer whose issues are not really diagnosable nor comparable to each other. In which situation thin clients may become the only practical answer:\n\nMany organizations use thin clients for applications which require high security, involve unreliable users or repurpose older machines for continued use. This much simplifies boot image control by facilitating centralized management of computers, and has many advantages:\n\nWhile control of the images is simpler, there are disadvantages. Thin clients:\n\nMany organizations try to gain the advantages of thin clients without the disadvantages by treating many very standard machines as if they were terminals, but with very much greater capabilities. As they buy new computers, they put the demanding applications on those.\n\nAdministrators perform a regular (often bi-annual) boot turn that re-images many older, off-spec machines at once so that new hardware can be deployed for higher-end use. This procedure is called cascading: the oldest hardware is repurposed with simpler software to let it continue in use for some less demanding or more access-controlled applications, but subjects it to much more rigorous control to minimize the number of images.\n\nThe total cost of operations correlates strongly to the total number of different images, not the total number of computers. To minimize the number of images requires additional discipline:\n\nDesktop computing is increasingly relying on web services, making the thin client approach more viable. Departmental boot images may remain but simply instantiate part of a semantic service-oriented architecture, especially in larger organizations. A service component architecture would further simplify the implementation of control mechanisms, especially if a single application language like Java was used for all custom applications in the enterprise. More importantly, shift to software as a service by most large vendors means that applications are not tied to machines, so the number of variant boot images required (with the applications installed) is reduced.\n\nOther open configuration technologies such as Bitfrost, OpenID and even XMPP would also simplify configuration of boot images, as authentication would no longer be dealt with on the desktop/laptop device.\n\nLarge system vendors increasingly provide DVDs with the boot image standard for the machine as shipped to the customer, which usually includes tools to diagnose changes to the machine and download drivers.\n"}

His father was impoverished, formerly part of the Ottoman Bosnian nobility. Mehmedbašić worked as a carpenter. During a Muslim youth organization's trip to Belgrade, Mehmedbašić befriended Mustafa Golubić (another Muslim, also from Stolac) who influenced his revolutionary feelings. Mehmedbašić, as did Mustafa Golubić, identified as Serb Muslim.\n\nWhile working as a carpenter, Mehmedbašić befriended Black Hand member Danilo Ilić, the main organizer of conspiracy against the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He joined the Young Bosnia revolutionary organization and became a colleague of its ideologue Vladimir Gaćinović, who was also a member of the Black Hand. As Mehmedbašić held strong Serbian nationalist sentiment, and Ilić and Gaćinović saw a strong character in him, he was given delicate duties. He was sworn into the Black Hand by Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Gaćinović and Danilo Ilić. In 1912–13, Serbia fought in the Balkan Wars. Black Hand founding member Vojislav Tankosić led a Chetnik detachment, in which many revolutionaries volunteered (including Golubić).\n\nIn late 1913, Danilo Ilić recommended the end of revolutionary organization building and a move to direct action against Austria-Hungary when meeting a Serbian captain and fellow Black Hand member in Užice. Ilić then met with Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević \"Apis\", the leader of the Black Hand, to discuss the matter. Apis' right hand, Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosić, called an action planning meeting in Toulouse, France. On Orthodox New Year, Golubić called Mehmedbašić, who was in Stolac, to immediately come to the meeting in Toulouse. During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed, including Franz Ferdinand. However, it was decided only to kill the Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek. The assassination plot was organized in Toulouse by Gaćinović and Golubić. Mehmedbašić was chosen for the task. He had left Stolac with 300 \"krone\" borrowed to finance the plot. Mehmedbašić was (according to himself) \"eager to carry out an act of terrorism to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia.\" He was given a Swedish knife containing poison.\n\nMehmedbašić arrived at Dubrovnik by steamship, and then travelled by train. At the Hum train station, on the way to Sarajevo, gendarmes searched the train; fearing they were on to him, he threw the knife out the window. Potiorek was planned to be assassinated at the end of March 1914, when the new mufti Čaušević was to be enthroned in Sarajevo. However, upon hearing that Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria would come to Sarajevo on Vidovdan, the Black Hand changed their minds. The Archduke's scheduled visit on Vidovdan (28 June), a Serbian national holiday, was perceived as an insult. Ilić summoned Mehmedbašić and informed him on 26 March that the plan now was to murder Archduke Franz Ferdinand, as ordered by Apis, and Mehmedbašić should stand by for the new operation. Mehmedbašić said during talks of the assassination that \"half of Bosnia and Herzegovina will join the plot, and the other half will approve everything we do\".\n\nApis and fellow conspirators Milan Ciganović and Major Tankosić hired three youngsters, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović and Trifko Grabež to carry out the assassination. Gavrilo Princip stayed in Sarajevo with Danilo Ilić, who hired three more as a backup team, Vaso Čubrilović, Cvjetko Popović and Mehmedbašić. On 28 June, a Sunday, a motorcade took the royal party to the City Hall for the official reception. Security was light; the Archduke objected to heavy security and soldiers between him and the people. 120 police officers were on crowd duty. The group of six assassins were positioned along the route, the Appel Quay. The first opportunity came to Mehmedbašić, who stood by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, but he lost his nerve (later claiming that a policeman stood near and would have intervened if he took his grenade) and watched the motorcade pass. Likewise, the second, Čubrilović, did not act. The next, Čabrinović, threw his bomb which bounced off the royal car and exploded under the following car, wounding two in the car and twenty in the crowd, then failed at suicide as his cyanide did not work and was arrested. Princip, hearing the explosion, believed the assassination to be a success and went to a nearby café. The motorcade made it safely to the Hall, and speeches were held, in which Franz Ferdinand was concerned about the injured and insisted on visiting them at the hospital, advised against by von Morsey but supported by Potiorek. As the motorcade took a wrong route to the hospital, it found itself outside the café where Princip was at; he fired fatal shots at the royal couple and then turned the gun at himself, however, two bystanders stopped him and he was arrested.\n\nČabrinović and Princip gave up the names of their fellow conspirators under torture. Mehmedbašić managed to escape (wearing civilian clothes and a fez) to Montenegro, arriving on 4 July, but Danilo Ilić, Veljko Čubrilović, Vaso Čubrilović, Cvjetko Popović and Miško Jovanović were arrested and charged with treason and murder. Upon learning that Mehmedbašić was in Nikšić, the Austro-Hungarian authorities urged the Montenegrin authorities to have him arrested and handed over to them. Jovan Plamenac said that the Montenegrin government gave strict orders to capture Mehmedbašić, but informed the Austro-Hungarian diplomacy that the Montenegrin government had no intention to hand him over if they captured him, and that instead a Montenegrin court would judge him. On 12 July, Mehmedbašić was apprehended by the Montenegrin authorities. However, before he was extradited he escaped from the Nikšić prison two days later. It has been claimed that the Montenegrin government hid him and had him sent over the Čakor mountain into Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian authorities suspected Montenegrin collusion in his escape and arrested the gendarmes who guarded Mehmedbašić. During his captivity Mehmedbašić admitted his complicity in the assassination.\n\nIn Serbia, Mehmedbašić met up with Mustafa Golubić, with whom he joined the Chetnik detachment of Vojislav Tankosić that fought in World War I. He trained Bosnian volunteers. Mehmedbašić met with Apis on several occasions.\nMehmedbašić was accused of having participated in an alleged plot to kill Serbian regent Alexander in 1916. For some time, Regent Alexander and officers loyal to him had planned to get rid of the military clique headed by Apis who represented a political threat to Alexander's power. The Austro-Hungarian peace demand gave added impetus to this plan. On 15 March 1917 Apis and the officers loyal to him were indicted, on various false charges by Serbian Court Martial on the French-controlled Salonika front (known in Serbo-Croatian as \"\"). On 23 May Apis and eight of his associates were sentenced to death; two others (one was Mehmedbašić) were sentenced to 15 years in prison. Charges were eventually reduced, leaving three death sentences in place. Among those tried, Apis, Ljubomir Vulović, Rade Malobabić and Mehmedbašić confessed their roles in Sarajevo. During the trial, Mehmedbašić said that \"I saw in Serbia with my eyes as the Piedmont of Serbdom, I couldn't see anything else...\" and that his idol was \"the national \"guslar\" (poet) singing Serbian songs\". It was later found that Mehmedbašić had in fact proved the trial false. Serbia's Supreme Court retried the case and all defendants were exonerated (rehabilitated) in 1953.\n\nHe survived the war and arrival of the Serbian army in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \"happiest day in his life\". Mehmedbašić was commuted and released in 1919.\n\nAfter World War I, Mehmedbašić returned to Sarajevo and in 1919 was pardoned.\n\nMehmedbašić was killed during World War II by the Ustaše on 29 May 1943. He was buried in the Butmir district of Sarajevo, on the outskirts of the city.\n\n"}

It is a private company which operates a music publishing company called \"Another Victory, Inc.\" and is the distributor of several smaller independent record labels. It has featured many prominent post-hardcore and metalcore artists, and such bands as Thursday, Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Taking Back Sunday, Bayside, Streetlight Manifesto, and A Day to Remember.\n\nIn September 2019, years after buying part of the label's catalogue, Concord Music agreed to acquire Victory Records and Another Victory for $30 million.\n\nThe label has released six gold-certified albums by A Day to Remember, Hawthorne Heights, and Taking Back Sunday; and one platinum single (\"If It Means a Lot to You\" by A Day to Remember). Victory's albums have sold 15 million copies. The label's catalogue includes 4,500 master recordings, and 3,500 compositions through its publisher Another Victory.\n\nOriginally focusing on hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands, Victory later expanded its roster to include emo and pop punk acts.\n\nIn early 2002, twenty-five percent of the label was announced to have been sold to MCA Records. However, later that year the deal was terminated by Victory. Victory is currently partnered with and distributed by Sony's RED Distribution.\n\nIt was announced in April 2014 that the label would be sponsoring a Victory Records stage for the entirety of the Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival featuring five of their artists: Emmure, Ill Niño, Wretched, Islander and Erimha. They would continue to sponsor the stage through the eighth annual festival with five of their artists to be announced.\n\nAnother Victory is the sister publishing company to Victory Records, founded in 1997. The company holds a variety of worldwide sub-publishing deals, including those with Mushroom Group, BMG Chrysalis, David Gresham Publishing, CTM Publishing, Clipper's Music, FujiPacific Music INC., FujiPacific Music (S.E. ASIA) LTD., Gulliver Music Publishing, Basement Brazil, and Musou LTD. Music Publishing.\n\nRepresenting a catalog of over 5,000 songs, Another Victory has landed a multitude of big-name placements for its artists tracks various movies, games and advertisements including \"Chain Gang\" by Close Your Eyes in NHL 15, \"Like LaMotta\" by Emmure on Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series), \"All I Want\" by A Day To Remember in Crazy Taxi: City Rush, \"Die Knowing\" by Comeback Kid on , and \"Let Me Teach You How To Eat\" by The Reverend Horton Heat on Ridiculousness (TV series).\n\nVictory has had distribution deals with Sumerian Records, Rise Records, and Red Cord Records.\n\nIn July 2012, it was announced that Victory would become the distribution home for Boston, MA based record label, We Are Triumphant. On May 10, 2013 Victory announced they will be distributing I Scream Records. On September 9, 2014 Famined Records signed a distribution deal with Victory. On February 9, 2017 it was announced that Wilhelm Records will exclusively distribute through Victory Records.\n\n\n\n\nVictory Records has had some negative relations with artists signed to the label. Over the years, multiple bands have cited grievances, conflicts, or filed lawsuits against the record label, while others have stayed with record label for years, or even came back to Victory after releasing albums on different labels.\n\nFormer Victory band Thursday has had a conflict with the label, citing issues with royalties. The band also cited an incident involving the Victory Records marketing staff producing whoopie cushions for the promotion of their 2001 album \"Full Collapse\", against their wishes. Thursday stated in the DVD accompanying their compilation album Kill the House Lights that they chose to go to a major label (Island Def Jam in 2002) and after fulfilling their contract, Tony Brummel and Victory Records welcomed Thursday \"back with open arms.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2015, Wil Francis of Horror Punk band Aiden posted on their official Facebook that they sold 500,000 albums total through Victory Records and were not paid.\n\nDespite the controversy, relations between Victory Records and its bands have not been all negative. Close Your Eyes and Ill Niño have mentioned positive relations multiple times in interview. Emmure has said specifically \"Victory does good business, and if you’re a band that is expecting more than what you get, then you’re going to feel cheated and robbed.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2006, the Victory-signed band Hawthorne Heights announced in a \"manifesto\" on their website that they were leaving the label and filed a lawsuit accusing Victory of fraudulent accounting practices and for \"severely damag[ing] the band's reputation and relationship with their fans.\" Brummel allegedly issued public statements in the band's name criticizing hip-hop and singer Ne-Yo (whose CD \"In My Own Words\" was Hawthorne Heights' most prominent competition on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts), as well as urging street team members to conceal copies of Ne-Yo's CD in record stores. On September 13, 2006, Victory records countersued Hawthorne Heights, accusing the band of breach of contract and libel.\n\nIn October 2006, a Chicago judge dismissed two of the three main claims in the band's suit, ruling that the trademark and copyright violation allegations were unfounded.\nOn March 5, 2007 a federal judge in Chicago ruled that Victory Records does \"not\" hold exclusive rights for the band's recording services and that the band can record for any label. Specifically, the judge stated: \"The agreement contains no exclusivity provision, nor does any of its language appear to prevent [the band] from recording elsewhere during the life of the agreement\".\nThe judge later reaffirmed this ruling on May 17, 2007, stating that Hawthorne Heights is still contractually bound to deliver two albums to Victory, but may record albums which are released elsewhere.\n\nIn January 2008, Victory filed a lawsuit against Virgin/EMI Records alleging that \"Virgin/EMI improperly induced platinum-selling band Hawthorne Heights to repudiate its contract with top independent label Victory Records\", including allegations that Virgin/EMI funded the initial phase of Hawthorne Heights' lawsuit against Victory. The suit sought actual damages of $10M and punitive damages of $25M.\n\nOn December 15, 2011, it was announced that A Day to Remember planned on filing a civil action against the label for breach of contract. Legal action was reportedly initiated on May 31 of that year, in which the band claimed that Victory owed them over $75,000 in royalties. Victory Records has said, on their behalf, that the lawsuit is actually about the band's refusal to fulfill their five-album contractual commitment to Victory and their newfound desire to move to a major label.\n\nOn October 5, 2013, news outlets reported that A Day to Remember had been given permission to self-release their new album \"Common Courtesy\" without any involvement from Victory. The album was released digitally on October 8, 2013. Victory and the band released statements in response to the court ruling.\n\nOn November 26, 2016, A Day to Remember won the lawsuit against Victory Records. The band was given $4.02 million dollars and won three of the four issues they were suing Victory for fulfilling the bands contract, controlling the band's publishing, and digital royalty withheld from the band. Victory won the band's master recordings.\n\nBeginning in May 2011, the label was widely criticized for signing groups perceived as inferior to many of the bands they signed in the past. Some bloggers called Design the Skyline \"the worst band ever.\" Although Victory refused to comment on the signing, they continued to promote the band regardless of the criticism. The band however, did comment on their controversy, stating; \"We really don’t mind. We can honestly see why people give us negative feedback for one, the way we look and the fact that we got signed to a mainly hardcore metal label with just one song; we stick out like a sore thumb. And not to mention how young we are.\"\n\nSka-punk group Streetlight Manifesto has had numerous conflicts and has a generally poor relationship with Victory Records. The band left the label after their album The Hands That Thieve. In February 2012, Streetlight Manifesto went so far as to request that their fans boycott their (Streetlight Manifesto's) music and other items from the Victory record label's online store.\n\nOn October 20, 2015, media outlets reported of a $1,000,000 lawsuit filed by Victory Records against lead vocalist Tomas Kalnoky. The lawsuit was filed in regard to the band not fulfilling their record deal of four studio albums to be released under Victory. The band released five albums while on the label, however Victory claims that \"\"... the band agreed not to count this album as one of the four albums under its contract to receive a $10,000 emergency advance.\"\" Victory also claims that the band's album does not count towards the contract due to it being a covers album. The lawsuit claims the $1,000,000 is to be paid for Streetlight not fulfilling their 4 album record deal, as well as damages for copyright infringement relating to the release of their last album The Hands That Thieve in which Tomas Kalnoky released an acoustic version of the album under his pseudonym Toh Kay titled \"The Hand That Thieves\". The Toh Kay release was officially cancelled, however the release was later made available online.\n\nOn April 19, 2017, the band announced on their social media pages that a settlement had been reached with Victory Records. As part of the settlement, Victory Records sold all Streetlight Manifesto master tapes back to the band.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1915636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915636", "title": "Identity crisis", "text": "Identity crisis\n\nIn psychology, identity crisis is the failure to achieve ego identity during adolescence. The term was coined by German psychologist Erik Erikson.\n\nThe stage of psychosocial development in which identity crisis may occur is called the identity cohesion vs. role confusion. During this stage, adolescents are faced with physical growth, sexual maturity, and integrating ideas of themselves and about what others think of them. Adolescents therefore form their self-image and endure the task of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity. Successful resolution of the crisis depends on one's progress through previous developmental stages, centering on issues such as trust, autonomy, and initiative.\n\nErikson's own interest in identity began in childhood. Born Ashkenazic Jewish, Erikson felt that he was an outsider. His later studies of cultural life among the Yurok of northern California and the Sioux of South Dakota helped formalize Erikson's ideas about identity development and identity crisis. Erikson described those going through an identity crisis as exhibiting confusion.\n\nSometimes individuals face obstacles that may prevent the development of a strong identity. This sort of unresolved crisis leaves individuals struggling to \"find themselves\". They often seem to have no idea who or what they are, where they belong or where they want to go. They may withdraw from normal life, not taking action or acting as they usually would at work, in their marriage or at school, or be unable to make defining choices about the future. They may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs since from their point of view having a negative identity could be more acceptable than none at all.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, those who emerge from the adolescent stage of personality development with a strong sense of identity are well equipped to face adulthood with confidence and certainty. \n\nErikson felt that peers have a strong impact on the development of ego identity during adolescence. He believed that association with negative groups such as cults or fanatics could actually \"redistrict\" the developing ego during this fragile time. The basic strength that Erikson found should be developed during adolescence is fidelity, which only emerges from a cohesive ego identity. Fidelity is known to encompass sincerity, genuineness and a sense of duty in our relationships with other people.\n\nHe described identity as \"a subjective sense as well as an observable quality of personal sameness and continuity, paired with some belief in the sameness and continuity of some shared world image. As a quality of unself-conscious living, this can be gloriously obvious in a young person who has found himself as he has found his commonality. In him we see emerge a unique unification of what is irreversibly given—that is, body type and temperament, giftedness and vulnerability, infantile models and acquired ideals—with the open choices provided in available roles, occupational possibilities, values offered, mentors met, friendships made, and first sexual encounters.\"\n\nJames Marcia's research on identity statuses of adolescents also applies to Erikson's framework of identity crises in adolescents.\n\nIdentity foreclosure is an identity status which Marcia claimed is an identity developed by an individual without much choice. \"The foreclosure status is when a commitment is made without exploring alternatives. Often these commitments are based on parental ideas and beliefs that are accepted without question\". Identity foreclosure can contribute to identity crises in adolescents when the \"security blanket\" of their assumed identity is removed. These \"foreclosed individuals often go into crisis, not knowing what to do without being able to rely on the norms, rules, and situations to which they have been accustomed.\" An example of this would be a son of a farmer who learns that his father is selling the farm, and whose identity as an heir to a farm and the lifestyle and identity of a farmer has been shaken by that news.\n\nIdentity diffusion is a Marcian identity status that can lead to identity crises in adolescents. Identity diffusion can be described as \"the apathetic state that represents the relative lack of both exploration and commitment\". Identity diffusion can overlap with diagnoses such as schizophrenia and depression, and can best be described as a lack of identity structure. An example of an identity crisis emerging from this status is an adolescent who becomes reclusive after his identity as a star athlete is destroyed by a serious injury.\n\nIdentity moratorium is the status that Marcia theorizes lasts the longest in individuals, is the most volatile, and can be best described as \"the active exploration of alternatives\". Individuals experiencing identity moratorium can be very open-minded and thoughtful but also in crisis over their identity. An example of this would be a college student who lacks conviction in their future after changing majors multiple times but still cannot seem to find their passion.\n\nIdentity achievement is the resolution to many identity crises. Identity achievement occurs when the adolescent has explored and committed to important aspects of their identity.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in south-east London on Evans Blvd, in the Summerside subdivision. It is named after Métis leader Gabriel Dumont.\n\nProportionate to its size, London has an extremely small francophone population; however, it qualifies for French language services under the French Language Services Act, and also qualifies to have French schools. While there have been French elementary schools in London since 1972, it was not until 1979 that a French high school was created. Originally it was only one class, at London Central Secondary School. Over time, the program grew to include a wide variety of subjects and became known as \"Le Module scolaire de langue française\" (MSLF). Due to changes in the organizational structure of the education system in Ontario, the MSLF became Gabriel-Dumont in 1998.\n\nIt would subsequently move out of Central, and into the same building as the Catholic school. The project that would become CDL had been in the works for over a decade; however, it was stymied by political fighting. In 2007, it was announced that Gabriel-Dumont would move from its location within the CDL project and into its own building in September 2012 on Evans Blvd in the Summerside subdivision.\n\nThe school grades are different from most schools in Southwestern Ontario, which start at Grade 9 and end in Grade 12.

Prior to starting Project 529, Allard was chief technology and experience officer for the Entertainment and Devices Division at Microsoft. He was instrumental in bringing Microsoft into the Internet age, leading the development of Internet technologies for Windows, and oversaw the company's first foray into the video game industry. Allard shipped over 30 products during his tenure at Microsoft and was a founding member of many Microsoft businesses, including Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox Live, Windows NT and the TCP/IP product families.\n\nAllard is a 1991 Boston University graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science. In 2003, he received the Distinguished Alumni award and delivered the CS department commencement address. He later received an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters) from Boston University at the 2009 Boston University commencement ceremony alongside Larry Bird and Steven Spielberg. In 2019, Allard was awarded an Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF) to New Zealand, joining a community of entrepreneurs and investors to create global change.\n\nAllard started the 529 Garage bicycle registration service in 2014 in Portland, Oregon, which today is the world's largest bike registration network, surpassing one million registered users. The service is used by bicycle owners, cities, law enforcement, universities and bike shops as a registration, reporting and recovery program. Since launching the first official test city of Vancouver, Canada in 2015, bike theft has dropped 30% and hundreds of stolen bicycles have been reunited with their owners. The program is now rapidly expanding throughout North America and has captured the attention of the World Bank. \n\nAllard joined Microsoft in 1991, recruited from Boston University as a Program Manager on the LAN Manager team overseeing the network protocol efforts and NDIS program. The former chief experience officer is best known for developing the Xbox product family, as well as his 1994 memo, \"Windows: The Next Killer Application on the Internet\", encouraging the Microsoft team to embrace the Internet. The memo, distributed to Microsoft leaders, captured the attention of Bill Gates and is cited for reshaping the company's direction, earning Allard the reputation as \"Microsoft's Father of the Internet.\" According to an internal email, Allard was a network engineer responsible for convincing Microsoft to ship TCP/IP in Windows 95.\n\nAllard co-founded the Xbox project in 1999, primarily focused on the Xbox software platform, Xbox Live, and recruiting third-party developers and publishers to support the program. He was later promoted to the position of CTO and CXO of the Entertainment and Devices Division. This role had Allard building a unified design team, an incubation & prototyping team called Alchemie Ventures and new product development such as Zune, Kin and Courier. Throughout his career, Allard was an advocate for open standards serving on the Windows Sockets, IETF, IAB and W3C organizations. He often served as a media spokesperson for Microsoft as part of his product and standards work. \n\n\nThe Zune program started following the launch of the Xbox 360 in 2006. It was co-led by Allard (product) and Bryan Lee (business). When Lee stepped down in 2007 from his post as Zune Executive in charge of business development, Allard took over as the new executive. Allard oversaw development of the Microsoft Zune, a handheld portable media device, initially seen by some media as a potential iPod rival. The first generation Zune shipped in 2006 and sold more units than all non-iPod MP3 players sold in its first year.\n\nThe Microsoft Kin phone project, first known by the codename 'Project Pink', began under Allard in 2008. After an internal power struggle, control of the project was moved from Allard to Andy Lees, who headed the Windows Phone division. The project cost Microsoft US$1 billion and was discontinued on June 30, 2010 due to poor sales.\n\nAllard headed up the team at Microsoft that created the two-screen tablet prototype and business plan called Courier. The Courier project did not receive funding by Steve Ballmer, who insisted that the product run Windows and Office. Shortly after Ballmer's decision to cancel development of the Courier, Allard left Microsoft, though said his decision to leave was unrelated to the Courier cancellation.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Allard left Microsoft. Upon announcing his retirement, Allard wrote an internal email named \"Decide. Change. Reinvent.\" to Microsoft employees discussing his career history at Microsoft and attempting to instill inspiration to a group of employees at Microsoft he refers to as \"The Tribe.\" According to Allard, \"The Tribe\" is \"a group of people diverse in perspective, similar in skills and completely, totally galvanized around one central purpose. Change.\" \n\nBefore leaving Microsoft, Allard became a director of The Clymb, a Flash sale site featuring outdoor products. In June 2011, The Clymb raised $2 million from a handful of angel investors, including Allard, and was sold to LeftLane Sports in 2016.\n\nAllard joined Intellivision Entertainment on May 14, 2020, as the global managing director to help oversee the release of the Intellivision Amico.\n\n"}

He was highly involved in sports during high school while he attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California. He played baseball, soccer, football, and basketball. He was CCS Junior of the Year in baseball. \n\nAfter completing his secondary education, he graduated from San Jose City College in 1988 with an AA Degree in Business. He was a Junior College 1st Team All American at San Jose. He then majored in Accounting with a minor in Psychology at the University of Arizona. Erickson was inducted into the Arizona Wildcat Hall of Fame after just one year of pitching at Arizona. Erickson set a school record for wins with an 18-3 record, as he led the country in wins (18), innings pitched (175), and complete games (14). Those impressive numbers earned him a unanimous First Team All-American honor. His teammates at Arizona included Trevor Hoffman, Kevin Long, and J. T. Snow. In 1989, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\n\nErickson began his professional career after being selected in the major league draft four times. He was drafted by the New York Mets in 1986 out of Homestead High School; the Houston Astros in 1987 and Toronto Blue Jays in 1988 out of San Jose City College; and in he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 4th round of the amateur draft out of the University of Arizona. He finally signed his first pro contract with MInnesota. After 27 minor league starts, Erickson rose to the major leagues in his second season of professional baseball with the Class AA Orlando Sun Rays. He was on a five-game win streak with a record of 8-3 in the first half as an All Star in the Southern League.\n\nErickson finished 1990 with a combined record of 16-7; going 5-0 in September and tying Dave Stewart for American League Pitcher of the Month. After posting a record of 12-2 with a 1.39 ERA in the first half of the 1991 season, including being awarded the American League Pitcher of the Month for May and June, Erickson was the first pitcher since 1954 to win 20 games in his first year in the Majors.

On April 27, 1994, Erickson no-hit the Milwaukee Brewers 6-0 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the first no-hitter ever pitched in that stadium. He became the third Twins pitcher, after Jack Kralick in 1962 and Dean Chance in 1967, to pitch a no-hitter; the former's had been the last no-hitter in a Twins home game, that game having taken place at the Metrodome's predecessor, Metropolitan Stadium. Erickson's no-hitter was thought to be impossible on The Metrodome's artificial turf and home run reputation.\n\nIn he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles. Before being traded to Baltimore, Erickson was 4-6 with a 5.95 ERA for the Twins. After joining the Orioles, Erickson turned in 9 wins in 16 starts for Baltimore.

{"id": "1915664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915664", "title": "Servant of God", "text": "Servant of God\n\n\"Servant of God\" is a term used for individuals by various religions for people believed to be pious in the faith's tradition. In the Catholic Church, it designates an individual who is being investigated by the Church for possible canonization as a saint. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this term is used to refer to any Eastern Orthodox Christian. The Arabic name \"Abdullah\" (from , \"ʿAbd Allāh\", \"Servant of God\"), the Hebrew name \"Obadiah\" (), the German name \"Gottschalk\", and the Sanskrit name \"Devadasa\" are all variations of \"servant of God\".\n\nThe expression \"servant of God\" appears nine times in the Bible, the first five in the Old Testament, the last four in the New. The Hebrew Bible refers to \"Moses the servant of Elohim\" (עֶֽבֶד הָאֱלֹהִ֛ים \"‘eḇeḏ-hā’ĕlōhîm\"; , , , and ). refers to Joshua as \"‘eḇeḏ Yahweh\" (עֶ֣בֶד יְהוָ֑ה).\n\nThe New Testament also describes Moses in this way in (τοῦ δούλου τοῦ Θεοῦ, \"tou doulou tou Theou\"). Paul calls himself \"a servant of God\" in (δοῦλος Θεοῦ, \"doulos Theou\"), while James calls himself \"a servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ\" (θεοῦ καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ δοῦλος, \"Theou kai Kyriou Iēsou Christou doulos\") in . describes \"servants of God\" (Θεοῦ δοῦλοι, \"Theou douloi\") being free to act within the bounds of God's will. Following usage conventions established in the King James Bible, the word \"servant\" is never capitalized or used as a title of nobility. (\"The servant is not greater than his lord.\")\n\n\"Servant of God\" is an expression used for a member of the Catholic Church whose life and works are being investigated in consideration for official recognition by the Pope and the Catholic Church as a saint in Heaven. The term \"Servant of God\" () should not be confused with \"Servus Servorum Dei\" (Servant of the Servants of God), one of the titles of the Pope.\n\nThe term \"Servant of God\" is used in the first of the four steps in the canonization process. The next step is being declared \"Venerable\", upon a decree of heroism or martyrdom by the honored. That is followed by beatification, with the title of \"Blessed\". After the confirmation of miracles resulting from the intercession of the honored, the final step is canonization, where the honored would receive the title of \"Saint\". The process for canonization is under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.\n\nAn incomplete list can be found in the List of Servants of God and Candidates for sainthood.\n\n\"Servant of God\" is not considered a canonical title in a strict sense by the Catholic Church (as for instance \"Venerable\" or \"Blessed\" are), but only a technical term used in the process of beatification. Hence, any of the faithful can be named a \"Servant of God\" in a larger frame of meaning.\n\nA guru or sat guru in various traditions of Hinduism is given the name Dasa, or \"servant of God\". A teacher also can be called \"uda ka das\", which means \"the servant of God\". In Sanskrit, the word \"dasa\" (IAST ') means \"servant,\" and this meaning is retained in all Indian languages where devotion to a personal God is practiced. In Tamil, \"tontai\", \"dasa\", servant, or \"slave,\" commonly are used to refer to devotees of Vishnu or Krishna. According to Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, as expressed in the Smriti statement ', living entities (\"bhuto\") are eternally in the service (\"dasa\") of the Supreme Lord (Hari). Thus, designation for Vaishnavas was the status title \"dasa\" as part of their names, such as Hari dasa, Narayana dasa, Ram das, Gopal das, etc.\n\n"}

Some awards are aimed at encouraging specific groups or individuals into study.\n\nIn England, financial support may be available from the college that the student attends. If the student is studying at either a public Sixth Form college or in a public Further Education college, financial support may be offered depending on their financial and personal circumstances. Each college has their own eligibility criteria however a college is able to provide details on which bursaries are available and what level of financial support students may be eligible for. \n\nFinancial support is almost always based the student's ″household″ income along with other criteria. Income level limits and eligibility vary from college to college so students must contact their college to obtain this information, although there are some basic eligibility requirements provided by the UK government on their website. If a student is considered to be a vulnerable student, a bursary of up to £1200 is available depending on specific circumstances\n\nMany colleges will ask students to make a bursary application using their online bursary application system. Other colleges will require a paper application form to apply. Evidence to support an application will always be required. Evidence documents may be scanned copies or photographs of documents but they must be verifiable and accepted by the college before a student will have their application approved. Some colleges will only allow paper versions of evidence.\n\nExamples of financial support provided by colleges in England are as follows. This list is not exhaustive however it is based on the awards provided by over 60 colleges in England (as of 2020).\n\nTo obtain such a bursary, it is customary for the student or their parents or guardians to be asked to provide details of their financial circumstances, supported by documentary evidence. The amounts awarded in Scotland, for instance, are made on a sliding scale, with household income below £34,000 p.a. (as of 2020) attracting awards. The application will be considered by the awarding organisation according to its published conditions although appeals may be considered from applicants in special or extenuating circumstances. The award will usually cover a specific period and may be given as a lump sum or on a declared schedule. Most bursaries are reviewed annually to ensure that the justification for an award remains. Changes in circumstances or study conditions such as a change of course during the academic year may result in the bursary being varied or stopped altogether.\n\nBursaries are similar to but distinct from \"scholarships\" or \"prizes\", which are based on performance or sponsorship. Scholarships and prizes are generally awarded for good performance in the study preceding course entrance in which the student achieves grades above the standard entry. These funders are usually education authorities, universities, companies and private trusts.\n"}

Bald, with a fake moustache, Finlayson had many trademark comic mannerisms and is known for his squinting, outraged, \"double take and fade away\" head reaction, and characteristic expression \"d'ooooooh\", and as the best remembered comic foil of Laurel and Hardy.\n\nFinlayson was known by a variety of nicknames. According to Laurel and Hardy scholar Randy Skretvedt, he \"called himself Jimmy, was known around the lot as Jim and is usually referred to today as 'Fin'\" – perhaps because he played a character called Fin in \"Our Relations\" and one named Mickey Finn in \"Way Out West\", or most likely, just as a truncated version of his surname.\n\nBorn in Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland to Alexander and Isabella (née Henderson) Finlayson, James worked as a tinsmith before pursuing an acting career. As part of John Clyde's company, he played the part of Jamie Ratcliffe in \"Jeanie Deans\" at the Theatre Royal in Edinburgh in 1910. The next year, following the death of his parents, he emigrated to the United States at the age of 24 with his brother Robert. Then, in May 1912 in New York City, he played the role of a detective disguised as a teuchter (person originating from the Scottish West Highlands or Western Isles) in the stage production \"The Great Game\" at Daly's Theatre: \"James Finlayson had an excellent opportunity, which he did not miss, for developing two characters in his one role – the simple, naive Scotsman and the artful, determined detective. The remarkable thing is that he managed to do them both at the same time.\"\n\nHe later won the role of Rab Biggar in the popular Broadway production of \"Bunty Pulls the Strings\" by Graham Moffat, and dropped out of a country-wide theatrical tour in 1916 to pursue a career in Hollywood.\nArriving in Los Angeles in 1916, he initially found film work at L-KO and Thomas H. Ince's studio.\nIn October 1919, he signed a contract with the Mack Sennett Comedies Corporation. He appeared in numerous Sennett-produced comedies, including the Keystone Kops.\n\nThe promotional newspaper article for the 1920 premiere of Sennett's \"Down on the Farm\", refers to Finlayson as \"legitimate and screen player of international celebrity\" and of his performance says: \"The in the case – a sort of cross between a Turkish Don Juan and a 'loan shark' – is played with rare power and comic results of seriousness by James Finlayson\". As a freelance actor late in his career, he made some of his final films in the UK. He played bit parts in films such as \"Foreign Correspondent\", \"To Be or Not to Be\", and \"Royal Wedding\", his last film before his death in 1953.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, when he worked for the Hal Roach Studios, Roach attempted to make a top-billed star out of Finlayson, but the effort was unfocused and he never caught on. The next step came in 1927 when the \"All-Star Comedy\" series gave Finlayson equal billing with up-and-coming co-stars Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, comedian Edna Marion, and others; some studio publicity even referred to Finlayson, Hardy and Laurel as a \"famous comedy trio\". But Roach staff producer and future multi-Oscared director Leo McCarey recognized the great potential of a Laurel-and-Hardy pairing and began developing their characters and expanding their roles toward that end; by the autumn of 1928, \"Laurel and Hardy\" was a formal studio series with its own production prefixes while the \"All-Star Comedy\" series – and Finlayson's equal co-billing – were things of the past. Nonetheless, he was still \"considered by many to be an indispensable part of the Laurel & Hardy team.\"\n\nAltogether, Finlayson played roles in 33 Laurel and Hardy films, usually as a villain or an antagonist, in such films \"Big Business\" (1929) and \"Way Out West\" (1937). Beside that, He starred alongside Stan Laurel in 19 films and opposite Oliver Hardy in five films before Laurel and Hardy were teamed together, appeared in dozens of Roach Studio films, with Charley Chase, Glenn Tryon, Snub Pollard, and Ben Turpin,and in several \"Our Gang\" shorts, including \"Mush and Milk\", in which he and Spanky McFarland match wits in a comically adversarial phone conversation.\n\nHe married Emily Cora Gilbert, an American citizen from Iowa, in 1919 and became a U.S. citizen in 1942.\n\nEnglish actress Stephanie Insall and Finlayson regularly took breakfast together. However, on the morning of 9 October 1953, Finlayson did not turn up at the usual time. Knowing that he had been ill from flu recently, Insall went to his home where she discovered his body. Finlayson had died of a heart attack. He was 66 years old.\n\nOne of Finlayson's trademarks was a drawn out \"dohhhhhhh!\" Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word \"Damn!\" This would later inspire Dan Castellaneta, the voice actor of Homer Simpson. During the voice recording session for a \"Tracey Ullman Show\" short, Castellaneta was required to utter what was written in the script as an \"annoyed grunt\". He rendered it as a drawn out \"dohhhhhhh\". This was inspired by Finlayson. Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered \"D'oh!\"\n\nJames (as \"Jimmy Finlayson\") is incorporated into the \"Catchphases 1\" section of the Comedy Carpet mosaic beside Blackpool Tower along with a \"D'OH!\" embossed star.\n\nA plaque by the Scottish Film Council honouring James was displayed in Bo'ness Library as part of the HippFest 2019 silent film festival.\n\nJames Finlayson is one of the many entertainers portrayed by the English actor Timothy Spall in the 2018 film \"Stanley: a Man of Variety\".\n\nIn the 2018 Laurel and Hardy biopic \"Stan & Ollie\", Finlayson is portrayed on the set of \"Way Out West\" by Scottish actor Keith Macpherson.\n\nAn international \"oasis\" of the Sons of the Desert fraternity called \"OUR RELATIONS (Tent of James Finlayson)\" was formed in Glasgow in 2019 by and for relatives of James.\n\n"}

{"id": "1915677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915677", "title": "Polydnavirus", "text": "Polydnavirus\n\nA polydnavirus (PDV) is a member of the family Polydnaviridae of insect viruses. There are currently 53 species in this family, divided among 2 genera. Polydnaviruses form a symbiotic relationship with parasitoid wasps (ichnoviruses occur in ichneumonid wasps species and bracoviruses in braconid wasps), but these wasps are themselves parasitic on Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). Little or no sequence homology exists between BV and IV, suggesting that the two genera evolved independently for a long time.\n\nGroup: dsDNA<br>\nOrder: unassigned<br>\nFamily: \"Polydnaviridae\"\n\nViruses in Polydnaviridae are enveloped, with prolate ellipsoid and cylindrical geometries. Genomes are circular and segmented, composed of multiple segments of double-stranded, superhelical DNA packaged in capsid proteins. They are around 2.0–31kb in length.\n\nViral replication is nuclear. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear pore export.\n\nParasitoid wasps serve as hosts for the virus, and Lepidoptera serve as hosts for these wasps. The female wasp injects one or more eggs into its host along with a quantity of virus. The virus and wasp are in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship: expression of viral genes prevents the wasp's host's immune system from killing the wasp's injected egg and causes other physiological alterations that ultimately cause the parasitized host to die. Transmission routes are parental.\n\nThese viruses are part of a unique biological system consisting of an endoparasitic wasp (parasitoid), a host (usually lepidopteran) larva, and the virus. The full genome of the virus is endogenous, dispersed among the genome of the wasp The virus only replicates in a particular part of the ovary, called the calyx, of pupal and adult female wasps. The virus is injected along with the wasp egg into the body cavity of a lepidopteran host caterpillar and infects cells of the caterpillar. The infection does not lead to replication of new viruses, rather it affects the caterpillar's immune system, as the virion carries virulence genes instead of viral replication genes. They can be considered a type of viral vectors.\n\nWithout the virus infection, phagocytic hemocytes (blood cells) will encapsulate and kill the wasp egg and larvae but the immune suppression caused by the virus allows for survival of the wasp egg and larvae, leading to hatching and complete development of the immature wasp in the caterpillar. Additionally, genes expressed from the polydnavirus in the parasitised host alter host development and metabolism to be beneficial for the growth and survival of the parasitoid larva. Thus the virus and wasp have a symbiotic (mutualistic) relationship.\n\n\nBoth genera of PDV share certain characteristics:\n\n\nHowever, the morphology of the two genera are different when observed by electron microscopy. Ichnoviruses tend to be ovoid (egg-shaped) while bracoviruses are short rods. The virions of Bracoviruses are released by cell lysis; the virions of Ichnoviruses are released by budding.\n\nNucleic acid analysis suggests a very long association of the viruses with the wasps (greater than 70 million years).\n\nTwo proposals have been advanced for how the wasp/virus association developed. The first suggests that the virus is derived from wasp genes. Many parasitoids that do not use PDVs inject proteins that provide many of the same functions, that is, a suppression of the immune response to the parasite egg. In this model, the braconid and ichneumonid wasps packaged genes for these functions into the viruses—essentially creating a gene-transfer system that results in the caterpillar producing the immune-suppressing factors. In this scenario, the PDV structural proteins (capsids) were probably \"borrowed\" from existing viruses.\n\nThe alternative proposal suggests that ancestral wasps developed a beneficial association with an existing virus that eventually led to the integration of the virus into the wasp's genome. Following integration, the genes responsible for virus replication and the capsids were (eventually) no longer included in the PDV genome. This hypothesis is supported by the distinct morphology differences between IV and BV, suggesting different ancestral viruses for the two genera. BV has likely evolved from a nudivirus ~. IV has a less clear origin; although earlier reports finds a protein p44/p53 with structural similarities to ascovirus, the link was not confirmed in later studies. In either case, both genera was formed through a single integration event in their respective wasp lineages.\n\nThe two groups of viruses in the family are not in fact phylogenetically related suggesting that this taxon may need revision.\n\nIn the host, several mechanisms of the insect immune system can be triggered when the wasp lays its eggs and when the parasitic wasp is developing. When a large body (wasp egg or small particle used experimentally) is introduced into an insect's body, the classic immune reaction is the encapsulation by the hematocytes. An encapsulated body can also be melanised in order to asphyxiate it, thanks to another type of hemocyte, which uses the phenoloxidase pathway to produce melanin. Small particles can be phagocytosed, and macrophage cells can then be also melanised in a nodule. Finally, insects can also respond with production of antiviral peptides.\n\nPolyDNAvirus protect the hymenopteran larvae from the host immune system, acting at different levels.\n\n\nAnother strategy used by parasitoid Hymenoptera to protect their offspring is production of virus-like particles. VLPs are similar to viruses in their structure, but they don't carry any nucleic acid. For example, \"Venturia canescens\" (Ichneumonidea) and \"Leptopilina sp.\" (Figitidaea) produce VLPs.\n\nVLPs can be compared to PolyDNAvirus because they are secreted in the same way, and they both act to protect the larvae against the host's immune system. \"V. canescens\"-VLPs (VcVLP1, VcVLP2, VcNEP ...) are produced in the calix cells before they go to the oviducts. Work in 2006 did not find their link to any viruses and assumed a cellular origin. More recent comparison links them to highly reshuffled domesticated Nudivirus sequences.\n\nVLPs protect the Hymenoptera larvae locally, whereas polyDNAvirus can have a more global effect. VLPs allow the larvae to escape the immune system: the larva is not recognised as harmful by its host, or the immune cells can't interact with it thanks to the VLPs. \"V. canescens\" use these instead of polydnaviruses because its ichnovirus has been deactivated.\n\nThe wasp \"Leptopilina heterotoma\" secrete VLPs that are able to penetrate into the lamellocytes, thanks to specific receptors, and then modify their shape and surface properties so they become inefficient and the larvae are safe from encapsulation. The \"Leptopilina\" VLPs or mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs) contain some secretion systems. Their evolutionary picture is less clear, but a recently reported virus, \"L. boulardi\" Filamentous Virus (LbFV), seems to show similarities.\n\nMicroRNA are small RNA fragments produced in the host cells thanks to a specific enzymatic mechanism. They promote viral RNA destruction. MicroRNA attach to viral-RNA because they are complementary. Then the complex is recognised by an enzyme that destroys it. This phenomenon is known as PTGS (for post transcriptional gene silencing)\n\nIt is interesting to consider the microRNA phenomenon in the polyDNAvirus context. Many hypotheses can be formulated:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915691", "title": "Off-the-Record Messaging", "text": "Off-the-Record Messaging\n\nOff-the-Record Messaging (OTR) is a cryptographic protocol that provides encryption for instant messaging conversations. OTR uses a combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffie–Hellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1 hash function. In addition to authentication and encryption, OTR provides forward secrecy and malleable encryption.\n\nThe primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniable authentication for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the participants. The initial introductory paper was named \"Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP\".\n\nThe OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov and released on 26 October 2004. They provide a client library to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to implement the protocol. A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete, offering an auto-detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that have it enabled, without interfering with regular, unencrypted conversations. Version 4 of the protocol is currently being designed by a team led by Sofía Celi, and reviewed by Nik Unger and Ian Goldberg. This version aims to provide online and offline deniability, to update the cryptographic primitives, and to support out-of-order delivery and asynchronous communication.\n\nOTR was presented in 2004 by Nikita Borisov, Ian Avrum Goldberg, and Eric A. Brewer as an improvement over the OpenPGP and the S/MIME system at the \"Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society\" (WPES). The first version 0.8.0 of the reference implementation was published on 21 November 2004. In 2005 an analysis was presented by Mario Di Raimondo, Rosario Gennaro, and Hugo Krawczyk that called attention to several vulnerabilities and proposed appropriate fixes, most notably including a flaw in the key exchange. As a result, version 2 of the OTR protocol was published in 2005 which implements a variation of the proposed modification that additionally hides the public keys. Moreover, the possibility to fragment OTR messages was introduced in order to deal with chat systems that have a limited message size, and a simpler method of verification against man-in-the-middle attacks was implemented.\n\nIn 2007 Olivier Goffart published mod_otr for ejabberd, making it possible to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on OTR users who don't check key fingerprints. OTR developers countered this attack by introducing socialist millionaire protocol implementation in libotr. Instead of comparing key checksums, knowledge of an arbitrary shared secret can be utilised for which relatively low entropy can be tolerated by using the socialist millionaire protocol.\n\nVersion 3 of the protocol was published in 2012. As a measure against the repeated reestablishment of a session in case of several competing chat clients being signed on to the same user address at the same time, more precise identification labels for sending and receiving client instances were introduced in version 3. Moreover, an additional key is negotiated which can be used for another data channel.\n\nSeveral solutions have been proposed for supporting conversations with multiple participants. A method proposed in 2007 by Jiang Bian, Remzi Seker, and Umit Topaloglu uses the system of one participant as a \"virtual server\". The method called \"Multi-party Off-the-Record Messaging\" (mpOTR) which was published in 2009 works without a central management host and was introduced in Cryptocat by Ian Goldberg et al.\n\nIn 2013, the Signal Protocol was introduced, which is based on OTR Messaging and the Silent Circle Instant Messaging Protocol (SCIMP). It brought about support for asynchronous communication (\"offline messages\") as its major new feature, as well as better resilience with distorted order of messages and simpler support for conversations with multiple participants. OMEMO, introduced in an Android XMPP client called Conversations in 2015, integrates the Double Ratchet Algorithm used in Signal into the instant messaging protocol XMPP (\"Jabber\") and also enables encryption of file transfers. In the autumn of 2015 it was submitted to the XMPP Standards Foundation for standardisation.\n\nCurrently, version 4 of the protocol has been designed. It was presented by Sofía Celi and Ola Bini on PETS2018.\n\nIn addition to providing encryption and authentication — features also provided by typical public-key cryptography suites, such as PGP, GnuPG, and X.509 (S/MIME) — OTR also offers some less common features:\n\n\nAs of OTR 3.1, the protocol supports mutual authentication of users using a shared secret through the socialist millionaire protocol. This feature makes it possible for users to verify the identity of the remote party and avoid a man-in-the-middle attack without the inconvenience of manually comparing public key fingerprints through an outside channel.\n\nDue to limitations of the protocol, OTR does not support multi-user group chat but it may be implemented in the future. As of version 3 of the protocol specification, an extra symmetric key is derived during authenticated key exchanges that can be used for secure communication (e.g., encrypted file transfers) over a different channel. Support for encrypted audio or video is not planned. (SRTP with ZRTP exists for that purpose.) A project to produce a protocol for multi-party off-the-record messaging (mpOTR) has been organized by Cryptocat, eQualitie, and other contributors including Ian Goldberg.\n\nSince OTR protocol v3 (libotr 4.0.0) the plugin supports multiple OTR conversations with the same buddy who is logged in at multiple locations.\n\nThese clients support Off-the-Record Messaging out of the box.\n\nThe following clients require a plug-in to use Off-the-Record Messaging.\n\nAlthough Gmail's Google Talk uses the term \"off the record\", the feature has no connection to the Off-the-Record Messaging protocol described in this article, its chats are not encrypted in the way described above—and could be logged internally by Google even if not accessible by end-users.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915692", "title": "David Johnston", "text": "David Johnston\n\nDavid Lloyd Johnston (born June 28, 1941) is a Canadian academic, author, and statesman who served as Governor General of Canada from 2010 to 2017, the 28th since Canadian Confederation. He is the commissioner of the newly created Leaders' Debates Commission and is Colonel of the Regiment for the Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\nJohnston was born and raised in Ontario, studying there before enrolling at Harvard University and later Cambridge and Queen's universities. He went on to work as a professor at various post-secondary institutions in Canada, eventually serving administrative roles as dean of law at the University of Western Ontario, principal of McGill University, and president of the University of Waterloo. At the same time, Johnston involved himself with politics and public service, moderating political debates and chairing commissions in both the federal and provincial spheres, his most renowned position in that field being the chairmanship of the inquiry into the Airbus affair. He was in 2010 appointed as governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of then Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, to replace Michaëlle Jean as viceroy and he occupied the post until succeeded by Julie Payette in 2017. At the time, Johnston was predominantly praised as a worthy choice for the Queen's representative, though his appointment was denounced by some Quebec sovereigntists.\n\nJohnston was born on June 28, 1941 in Sudbury, Ontario, to Lloyd Johnston, the owner of a hardware store, and Dorothy Stonehouse. He attended Sault Collegiate Institute in nearby Sault Ste. Marie, where he played quarterback for the football team and under-17 hockey with future National Hockey League (NHL) members Phil and Tony Esposito and Lou Nanne. Johnston aimed to play in the NHL himself and was visited by scout Jimmy Skinner. However, upon learning from Skinner that most boys drafted would not be completing high school, Johnston's mother refused to negotiate further.\n\nJohnston graduated high school and moved on to Harvard University in 1959, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree, \"magna cum laude\", in 1963. While at Harvard, under the coaching of Cooney Weiland, Johnston captained the varsity ice hockey team, was twice selected to the All-America team, and met and befriended Erich Segal, the two becoming jogging partners. In 1970, Segal wrote the best-selling novel \"Love Story\", basing a character in the book—Davey, a captain of the hockey team—on Johnston. Johnston suffered three concussions from playing football and hockey; he was told by his doctor to either wear a helmet (at a time when they were unpopular) or stop playing hockey.\n\nUpon completing his degree at Harvard, Johnston again looked at an NHL career, contemplating attending the Boston Bruins training camp. Instead, he attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, obtaining a Bachelor of Laws with honours in 1965, and another with first class honours from Queen's University in 1966. During that period, Johnston married his high school sweetheart, Sharon, with whom he has five daughters. Johnston was hired by Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, but never worked for the firm, instead taking a one-year leave of absence, which continues to today.\n\nJohnston has had a long academic career, during which he came to specialise in securities regulation, corporation law, public policy and information technology law. After 1966, he worked for two years as an assistant professor at the Queen's University Faculty of Law and then joined the University of Toronto's law faculty, where he taught until 1974, eventually being promoted to the rank of full professor. Johnston was then appointed as dean of the University of Western Ontario Law School, serving between 1974 and 1979, at which time he was elevated to become the fourteenth Principal and Vice-Chancellor of McGill University. It was during his time in that role that he became acquainted with Pierre and Margaret Trudeau, as the Johnston children played with the Trudeau children when the families were at their adjacent cottages in the Laurentians.\nJohnston stepped down in 1994 as principal of McGill to remain at the university only as a law professor until he was in 1999 installed as the fifth President of the University of Waterloo. At that time, the couple acquired a home in Heidelberg, Ontario, and began operating an adjacent horse training ranch, \"Chatterbox Farm\".\n\nJohnston has moderated several televised leaders' debates, the first being between Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, and Ed Broadbent, prior to the 1979 federal election, and he returned five years later to play the same role before the election of 1984, in a debate featuring Brian Mulroney, John Turner, and Broadbent. He also moderated the provincial leaders' debate featuring David Peterson, Bob Rae, and Larry Grossman, in the run up to the Ontario general election in 1987. Johnston has also acted as moderator of two public affairs panel discussion programmes, \"The Editors\" and \"The World in Review\", which aired in the 1990s on both CBC Newsworld in Canada and PBS in the United States.\n\nInvestigations commissioned by both federal and provincial Crowns-in-Council have been chaired by Johnston, starting with the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy in the late 1980s, followed by the National Task Force on High Speed Broadband Access, the Committee on Information Systems for the Environment, the Advisory Committee on Online Learning, Ontario's Infertility and Adoption Review Panel between 2008 and 2009, and other scientific or public policy panels. He also sat on the Ontario government's Task Force on Management of Large Scale Information and Information Technology Projects and an Ontario Ministry of Health panel investigating \"smart systems.\" Johnston further served on various corporate boards of directors, including those of Fairfax Financial Holdings, CGI Group, Dominion Textiles, Southam Incorporated, SPAR Aerospace, Seagram's, and Canada Trust, among others, and on March 22, 2010, was named to the Board of Governors of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. He is the only non-American citizen to chair the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\nOn November 14, 2007, Johnston was appointed by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, as an independent adviser and charged with drafting for the Cabinet the terms of reference for the public inquiry, known as the Oliphant Commission, into the Airbus affair. This appointment itself, however, was criticized by the independent citizens' group Democracy Watch as a conflict of interest, given that Johnston had once reported directly to Mulroney during the latter's time as prime minister. Johnston completed his report on January 11, 2008, listing seventeen questions of interest for further investigation. He did not, however, include as a subject the awarding of the Airbus contract, on the basis that this aspect had already been investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, prompting criticism from opposition members of parliament and accusations that Johnston had acted as the Prime Minister's man. This intensified after it was later revealed that Mulroney had accepted $300,000 in cash from Karlheinz Schreiber, but Oliphant could not examine any possible link between that payment and Airbus due to the narrow scope of the commission's mandate. Others, though, such as Peter George, then-president of McMaster University, and subsequently the editorial board of \"The Globe and Mail\", as well as Andrew Coyne in \"Maclean's\", defended Johnston, detailing his integrity and independence. Johnston's role as special adviser was parodied by Roger Abbott on the January 11, 2008, airing of \"Air Farce Live\".\n\nFor this corporate, government, charitable, and academic work, Johnston was in 1988 appointed to the Order of Canada as an Officer; he was promoted within the order to the rank of Companion in 1997. Johnston also gained a reputation as a non-partisan individual, but has expressed explicit support for Canadian federalism, having written a book opposing Quebec separatism, \"If Quebec Goes: The Real Cost of Separation\". He has also published numerous books on law, chapters in other volumes, magazine articles, and aided in writing legislation. and sat as the co-chair of the Montreal No Committee during the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence.\n\nOn July 8, 2010, the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada announced that Queen Elizabeth II had approved Prime Minister Stephen Harper's recommendation of Johnston to succeed Michaëlle Jean as the Queen's representative. At the time, Harper said of Johnston that he represents \"the best of Canada, he represents hard work, dedication, public service and humility. I am confident he will continue to embody these traits in his new role as the Crown representative in Canada.\" Johnston himself said in a press conference that he and his wife had always been dedicated to service and vowed to, while in office, defend Canadian heritage and institutions.\n\nA special search committee convened by the Prime Minister recommended Johnston for the viceregal position; the group was headed by Sheila-Marie Cook, secretary to the Governor General, and further consisted of Kevin MacLeod, the Canadian Secretary to the Queen, Usher of the Black Rod of the Senate of Canada, and parliament's top protocol officer; Christopher Manfredi, dean of the Faculty of Arts at McGill University; Rainer Knopff, a political scientist at the University of Calgary; Father Jacques Monet, of the Canadian Institute of Jesuit Studies; and Christopher McCreery, historian and private secretary to the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. The committee conducted extensive national consultations with over 200 people including academics, sitting and retired political leaders of all political persuasions including provincial premiers, current and former political party leaders, former prime ministers and others in order to develop a short list of candidates for the position. Also on the short list were other distinguished Canadians, including John de Chastelain and John Fraser.\n\nThe appointment was widely praised, its announcement garnering positive words from individuals like former University of Toronto president Robert Prichard and columnist Andrew Coyne. Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff stated, \"David Johnston's dedication to learning and innovation... combined with his legal expertise and constitutional knowledge makes him an ideal choice for Governor General.\" Johnston's university colleagues also noted his conciliatory abilities. Columnists stated that Johnston would be suited to face difficult constitutional choices, given the probability that the Canadian parliament's minority status would continue well after the start of his tenure as viceroy.\n\nThe press in Quebec generally focused on Johnston's ties to McGill University and his prominent role during the 1995 Quebec referendum. The president of Quebec's \"Conseil de la souveraineté\", Gérald Larose, declared Johnston to be an \"adversary\" of Quebec independence and Mario Beaulieu, head of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, called the nomination of Johnston \"partisan\" and the governor general-designate himself a \"federalist extremist\", statements that columnist Richard Martineau, criticized for creating a \"fake scandal\", since any Governor General of Canada would advocate for Canadian unity. In addition, Johnston's low profile was expected to result in less criticism directed at the governor general's office, compared to his two predecessors.\n\nThe Queen issued on September 3, 2010, under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, her commission naming Johnston as her next Canadian representative and, three days later, Johnston attended an audience with the Queen during a two-day stay at Balmoral Castle. At that time he was invested by the monarch as a Commander of both the Order of Military Merit and Order of Merit of the Police Forces. Johnston then announced to the media that there would be a theme to his installation ceremony: A call to service; he elaborated: \"This theme of service echoes that of Her Majesty the Queen's 2010 visit 'Honouring the Canadian Record of Service—Past, Present and Future,' and illustrates how the governor general exemplifies the Canadian value of service to community and country.\"\n\nJohnston's swearing-in took place on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa, on October 1, 2010. At his request, the ceremony included Johnston and his wife meeting 143 Canadians (one for each year passed since Confederation), especially from the Canadian Forces and young people, and collecting 26 red and white roses from 13 individuals, one from each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories. On the return coach ride from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall, the viceregal couple stopped to lay the bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\nOne of Johnston's first duties as governor general was to perform the rare task of revoking the commissioning scrolls of an officer of Her Majesty's Canadian Forces, on October 22, 2010, at the direction of the Chief of the Defence Staff, stripping the recently convicted murderer and rapist Russell Williams of his rank of colonel and releasing him from duty under \"service misconduct\". On November 4, the Governor General made his first visit to Afghanistan to meet with Canadian troops serving there and the Afghan forces they were training; similar visits to Afghanistan followed through Johnston's tenure, including a Christmas spent with Canadian Forces personnel stationed at Camp Alamo and Camp Black Horse, as did meetings with members of the military in other locations overseas.\nJohnston undertook his first state visits in February and March 2011, journeying to Kuwait (to attend its 50th Independence Day and take part in the celebrations of the fifth anniversary of the accession of Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah) and Qatar. He then, in April of the same year, attended the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton and the reception at Buckingham Palace that followed. In late June, he hosted the couple at various events during their tour of Canada.\n\nThe speech Johnston delivered on August 14, 2011, to the Canadian Bar Association's annual meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, attracted media attention for its criticism of the legal profession: the Governor General lamented unnecessary and deliberate legal delays across Canada, the role of unscrupulous American lawyers in the unfolding of the global financial crisis, and said the profession was losing the public's trust. These comments were noted for being unusually controversial for a viceroy, but Johnston's colleagues and the editorial board of \"The Globe and Mail\" found the Governor General's words to be both unsurprising and welcome.\n\nIn keeping with his focus on education, the Governor General, beginning in his early months in office and continuing throughout his time there, visited a number of universities across Canada, attending conferences, delivering lectures, and speaking at convocations. He also carried this theme on during his state and official visits to foreign countries, including in his itinerary, among other events, tours of early education facilities, delivering addresses at universities and colleges, and meetings with economic and social development groups, as well as education ministers. He was also sometimes accompanied by Canadian university and college presidents.\n\nOn Accession Day, February 6, 2012, Johnston took part in events launching Diamond Jubilee Week, marking the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the Canadian throne. He thereafter participated in related commemorations, parties, and unveilings of monuments all across the country, throughout the year, as well as during a working visit to the Commonwealth realm Barbados between his aforementioned visit to Brazil and a state visit to Trinidad and Tobago. Johnston later hosted Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on their tour of parts of Canada for the jubilee celebration and, in June, travelled to London, UK, to take part in various events held there for the jubilee. He then returned to London between July 25 and 30, to attend the Summer Olympics.\n\nIn January 2012, the Governor General opened the Crown-First Nations summit in Ottawa and at Rideau Hall hosted a meeting with First Nations youth leaders. By the end of the year, in the midst of the First Nations' Idle No More movement, national focus was turned partly on Johnston after Chief of the Attawapiskat First Nation Theresa Spence began a protest, deemed a \"hunger strike\", against certain First Nations-related actions by the federal government and parliament and vowed publicly to continue until both Prime Minister Harper and the Governor General together met with her. The Assembly of First Nations also on December 16 issued an open letter the Governor General calling for a meeting to discuss Spence's demands. A meeting between the Prime Minister, other Cabinet ministers, First Nations chiefs, and representatives of the Assembly of First Nations took place on January 11, 2013, but Johnston declined to attend, as \"it was not appropriate\" for the representative of a constitutional monarch to publicly participate in discussions on government policy. This, along with other factors, led Spence and other chiefs to boycott the Prime Minister's conference, though she did attend the meeting and ceremony for First Nations chiefs that Johnston hosted at Rideau Hall the same evening. Spence declared after that she was not satisfied with the content of that gathering, vowed to continue her protest, and she and the Governor General communicated directly via letter. Spence ended her protest on January 24, 2013, though the demand for a meeting of First Nations chiefs, Cabinet ministers, and the Governor General together remained in a declaration signed by Spence and two leaders in Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.\n\nThe bicentennial of the commencement of the War of 1812 was also marked by various official events attended by the Governor General. During the royal tour, Johnston and Prince Charles were on May 22 at a military event at Fort York in Toronto and Johnston was also in the region of Niagara-on-the-Lake on June 16, for various events at Queenston Heights, the Laura Secord homestead, and Fort George, to \"launch 1,000 days of commemorations\". A War of 1812 National Recognition Ceremony was also conducted at Rideau Hall on October 25, 2012, at which the Governor General presented special medals and a banner to leaders of First Nations and Métis communities with historical ties to the War of 1812.\n\nThe Governor General served as an honorary witness in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. When the commission's work was completed in December 2015, Johnston presided over a closing ceremony at Rideau Hall, which book-ended the commission along with the opening ceremony hosted by Johnston's viceregal predecessor. He called for expanded education about the residential school system and said \"this is a moment for national reflection and introspection... to think about the depth of our commitment to tolerance, respect and inclusiveness, and whether we can do better. This is a moment to think about those people – those children, those mothers and fathers, those families and those elders, past and present. And it's also a moment to ask: where do we go from here?\"\n\nColumnist John Robson said Johnston displayed a \"manifest sympathy for aboriginal causes\". However, the Governor General drew criticism on social media as a consequence of his saying, in an interview on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's radio show \"The House\", on June 17, 2017, that \"we're a country based on immigration, going right back to our, quote, Indigenous people, unquote, who were immigrants as well, 10, 12, 14,000 years ago\", referring to the migration of humans across Beringia. Johnston explained he misspoke and apologised for his statement during a ceremony at Rideau Hall to honour leadership on Indigenous issues.\n\nAs part of his efforts to promote education and research, Johnston, beginning in 2012, annually hosted the Killiam Award Symposium at Rideau Hall. In regard to philanthropy, the Governor General established in late 2013 the Rideau Hall Foundation, a charitable group meant to aid the viceroy in connecting and honouring Canadians, enhancing Canadian identity, and increasing potential for excellence with the aid of certain partners. Johnston then launched, via the foundation, the My Giving Moment campaign, encouraging Canadians to donate their time and/or money. He was aided in the launch by George Stroumboulopoulos, who interviewed the Governor General on his show \"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight\". Johnston stated near the end of his tenure that he would remain as chairman of the Rideau Hall Foundation after his successor took office.\n\nIn late 2016, the Governor General hosted a conference on concussions, declaring head injuries in sports to be a \"public health issue\", and criticized the NHL's position on fighting in hockey. This followed on his remark made in early 2012 to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that hockey should be made safer by redesigning hard-plastic equipment, eliminating head shots and high-sticking, and eliminating fighting, which he said in a later interview was \"eroding the game\". He called on the NHL to hold a summit on fighting and concussions. While Johnston did speak with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and the deputy commissioners about a two-day conference that would, with the involvement of medical experts and individuals associated with hockey, decide on new game rules, the group of people involved became too large to manage. Johnston instead turned his attention to the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada and raising awareness among parents.\n\nOn March 19, 2013, Johnston headed the official Canadian delegation for the Papal inauguration of Pope Francis. On November 1, 2013, he hosted Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, at the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award royal gala, held at Rideau Hall.\n\nIn March 2015, Johnston accepted an invitation to stay in the viceregal office until September 2017. This was considered desirable in order to ensure that an experienced viceroy was in place should the 2015 Canadian federal election result in a hung parliament or otherwise be inconclusive. In September 2017, he became the longest-serving governor general since Georges Vanier. It was also thought worthwhile for Johnston to remain in office for the Canada 150 celebrations.\n\nAs governor general, Johnston hosted over 600 events at either Rideau Hall or La Citadelle and, as commander-in-chief, attended 330 military events. Within Canada, Johnston visited more than 130 communities and, as part of the country's international relations, he led more than 50 international visits, making him the most travelled governor general in Canadian history. Conversely, he hosted approximately five dozen foreign dignitaries on state and working visits to Canada. The Governor General delivered over 1,400 speeches and awarded tens of thousands of honours, medals, and special commemorations and welcomed 1.5 million Canadians to Rideau Hall and the Citadel.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, the week of his departure, he presided over a military farewell ceremony and military parade by a 100-man guard of honour from the Canadian Armed Forces at the Aviation and Space Museum, at Rockcliffe Airport. A few days before Johnston completed his service, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described him as a family friend, \"a man of strength, intelligence and compassion.\" He also praised Johnston as an athlete and an academic dedicated to education and lifelong learning. The Government of Canada will donate $3 million, and up to $7 million in matching funds over 10 years, to the Rideau Hall Foundation, a charity founded by Johnston. Its goal, he said, \"is to gather, align and mobilize ideas, people and resources to move the Canadian spirit and our shared aspirations forward\".\n\nDavid Johnston's comments during a farewell ceremony on Parliament Hill included the following: \"Serving as Governor General is a responsibility I have cherished for the past seven years. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to give back to this country I love so much.\"\n\nShortly after the end of his vice-regal tenure, Johnston joined the consulting firm Deloitte as an executive advisor and will provide advice to private sector and government clients on \"innovation, inclusiveness, talent development and leadership, and the role those things play in economic growth.\"\n\nJohnston also holds a volunteer position as chair of the Rideau Hall Foundation, the charity he established in 2012.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, U Sports renamed the U Sports University Cup to the David Johnston University Cup in honour of Johnston.\n\nOn June 18, 2018, it was announced that Johnston would be appointed Colonel of the Regiment for the Royal Canadian Regiment, effective August 4, 2018. He succeeded Major-General (Retired) J. Ivan Fenton. The position was previously held by Colonel W. J. Aitchison.\n\nIn October 2018, Johnston was nominated to be the first commissioner of the Leaders' Debates Commission. He was subsequently confirmed to the position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The song was written by Noel Gallagher and produced by Oasis. It was released on 17 June 2002 as the second single from the band's fifth studio album, \"Heathen Chemistry\" (2002). Liam Gallagher is the lead vocalist on the track, with Noel on backing vocals.\n\n\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and reached a peak of number six on the UK Indie Chart. It peaked at number one in Italy, and reached the top 20 in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Norway. The song was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 12 July 2002, denoting shipments of over 200,000 copies. British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis recorded a cover version for her second studio album \"Echo\" (2009). She performed her version on the sixth series finale of \"The X Factor\", and it peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart and number 11 on the UK R&B Chart.\n\n\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" was written solely by Noel Gallagher, and was produced by Oasis. The song was recorded at Wheeler End Studios and Olympic Studios in England, and was mixed by Mark Stent. It was engineered by David Treahearn, Jan \"Stan\" Kybert and Paul \"P-Dub\" Walton. Several instrumentalists were used for the song's melody, including Andy Bell as the bass player, Oasis drummer Alan White, Noel Gallagher on electric guitar, and Gem Archer on piano. \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" is a motivational ballad which lasts for a duration of five minutes and five seconds. Its melodic structure bears strong resemblances to \"Slide Away\", one of their songs from their debut studio album \"Definitely Maybe\" (1994), while its hook is reminiscent of the chorus of their 1996 song \"Don't Look Back in Anger\". Liam Gallagher \"croons\" the lines \"All of the stars/ Are fading away/ Just try not to worry/ You'll see them some day\" as an orchestra plays in the background. \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" was composed in the key of B minor using common time at 76 beats per minute.\n\nJason Fox for \"NME\" felt that \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" was Oasis's return to the \"long lost humanism\" of their 1996 single \"Don't Look Back in Anger\", because of Noel Gallagher's ability to lighten the mood of his audience when they are in need. He further wrote that the listener is transported back when \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" was released. Simon Evans for musicOMH also compared the song to \"Don't Look Back in Anger\", writing that they have the same \"defiance\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic was brief in his review of the song, simply writing that it is a \"pretty good power ballad\". Evan Chakroff for Stylus Magazine wrote that the song was forgettable, adding that while writing his review of the album, he could not remember the melody of \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\". Victoria Segal for \"NME\" wrote a single review when it was released, and believed that it was difficult to take the song seriously. Segal wrote that it is a \"disappointing\" song that when \"looked at in the sober light of day, it's nothing but a lachrymose slur through the Big Noel Book Of Emotional Cliches and some truly shameless piano, but you just know that come closing time, it could make a breeze block cry\". BBC reviewer Chris Long stated he preferred previous single \"The Hindu Times\" but \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" delivered on the \"simple tunes, good strong riffs and textbook lyrics\" in which Gallagher specialised.\n\n\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart on 29 June 2002. The following week on 6 July, it fell two positions to number four, and again down to number 13 in its third week. It charted at number 23 and 28 in its fourth and fifth weeks, respectively. In 2009, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 71 on 14 November. It remained on the chart for a further week. In 2010, it re-entered the chart for a third time at number 50 on 9 October. On the UK Indie Chart, the song leaped from number 192 to number 30 on 10 October 2009. The following week it rose to number nine, but fell to number 26 the week after. On 14 November 2009, \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" rose from number 85 to number nine again.

On 2 January 2010, it fell from number six to number 22, but rose to number 18 the following week. \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 12 July 2002, denoting shipments of over 200,000 copies.\n\nIn Europe, \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" debuted and peaked at number 41 on the Austrian Singles Chart on 7 July 2002. It fell to number 45 in its second week, and to number 62 in its third. However, it ascended to number 56 in its fourth week. It spent a total of five consecutive weeks on the chart. In the Wallonia region of Belgium, the song peaked at number 13 on the Ultratip on 3 August 2002, remaining on the chart for three weeks, and re-entered the chart for one week at number 44 on 26 February 2011.

Outside of Europe, the song peaked at number 48 on the Australian Singles Chart.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Heathen Chemistry\".\n\n\n\n\nThe song was used as the ending theme for the 2004 film The Butterfly Effect and the Season 2 episode 'Red' of Smallville. It has also been featured in the film \"Made of Honor\", and an episode of the short-lived soap \"North Shore\".\n\n\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" is a cover song recorded by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album \"Echo\" (2009). Originally written by Noel Gallagher of rock band Oasis, the song was produced by Lewis and Steve Robson. Lewis decided to cover the track as she is a fan of Oasis and rock bands in general, and she really liked the song's sentiment. The strings were performed by London Session Orchestra, who were organised and arranged by Will Malone. The musical structure of the song is different from the conventional style which is normally used, as the song's melody does not gain momentum until the end of the song instead of by the first chorus.\n\nHer version of \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" garnered mostly negative reviews from music critics. Aside from comparisons to her previous singles \"Bleeding Love\" and her cover of Snow Patrol's \"Run\", reviewers felt as though she was too emotive and did not reflect the simplicity of the original. Although the arrangement of the song was criticised, Lewis's vocal performance was highly praised. The song peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart, number 11 on the UK R&B Chart and number 31 on the Irish Singles Chart. Lewis has performed the song live on the BBC Radio 2 show \"Live Sessions with Ken Bruce\", MTV Unplugged and on the sixth series finale of \"The X Factor\".\n\nIn an interview with Rick Edwards titled \"Under the Skin of Leona Lewis\" on 28 February 2010 for 4Music, Lewis revealed that she is a fan of Oasis and that \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" is a \"great song\" with a \"beautiful sentiment behind it\". She continued to say herself and label boss Simon Cowell discussed the possibility of Lewis recording a discussed cover version. Lewis cited her reason for wishing to record her own version as being a \"massive\" fan of rock bands, and that she wanted to put a \"different spin on it\". When asked the question of if she knew what Gallagher thought about her version, she replied saying that she had not spoken to them and that she did not know if they had listened to her version. Originally written solely by Gallagher, Lewis's cover version was produced by Steve Robson. Both Robson and Lewis were the vocal producers on \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\". It was engineered by Richard Flack, who was assisted in the process by vocal engineer Seth Waldmann. It was mixed by Jeremy Wheatly at Twenty-One Studios, located in London, England. A range of instrumentalists were bought in for the song; Karl Brazil played the drums, while Luke Potashnick provided guitar. John Garrison played the bass and Robson the piano. The London Session Orchestra performed the strings on \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" and it was arranged by Will Malone, while the choir was organised and arranged by Lawrence Johnson. Background vocals were performed by Sara-Jane Skeet and Beverly Skeet.\n\n\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" appears as the tenth track on \"Echo\" and lasts for a duration of four minutes and eight seconds. However, it is not included on the North American version of the album. The structure of the song is not conventional in its style, as most songs have gained momentum by the first chorus. However, Lewis's version of \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" remains down-tempo for the majority of the song. Andy Gill for \"The Independent\" noted that it does not possess the \"rapidly acquiring melodramatic heft and momentum by the first refrain\".\n\nLewis's version of \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" garnered mostly negative reviews from music critics. Nick Levine for Digital Spy complimented her version, writing that it is \"as satisfying as a sponge pudding on a chilly winter evening\". Michael Cragg for musicOMH wrote that \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" is another song to be given the \"Leona treatment\", and compared it to her cover of Snow Patrol's \"Run\", which she recorded for her inclusion on her debut studio album, \"Spirit\". He felt that her cover of Oasis's song appeared to serve as a \"replacement\" for covering Snow Patrol. He continued to criticise the production and vocal performance of Lewis's version, writing \"On this occasion the kitchen-sink style production – stirring strings, acoustic strums, and inevitable appearance of a choir – feels hollow, like being aurally attacked by a (admittedly very impressive) karaoke singer\". As part of his review of \"Echo\", Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine wrote that too much of the album is dominated by \"thoughtless\" ballads, which he highlighted in the form of \"Don't Let Me Down\" and \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\". While he noted that Lewis gives a \"technically unimpeachable\" vocal performance, he wrote that it does not compensate for the \"dull arrangement\" and lack of emotion in her delivery. Andy Gill for \"The Independent\" described her cover as \"sententious\". Neil McCormick for \"The Telegraph\" was critical of her decision to cover the song, writing that she is too emotive for the \"direct and simple\" lyrics, and concluded by saying that her version does not compare to Gallagher's \"raw-throated sincerity\".\n\nUpon the release of \"Echo\", \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" debuted at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital download sales on 28 November 2009. Following Lewis's performance on \"The X Factor\" finale, the song re-entered the singles chart at number 29 on 26 December 2009, rising 101 chart positions from the previous week. On 4 September 2010, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart for a third time at number 63. On 19 December 2009, the song rose from number 41 to number 34 on the UK R&B Chart. The following week on 26 December, it ascended to number 11. On 2 January 2010, it fell to number 15, and again to number 34 the next week. It remained inside the top 40 R&B chart for a further two weeks. The same week on the UK Download Chart, the song leaped from number 114 to number 27 for the chart issue dated 26 December 2009. In Scotland, the song rose from number 74 to number 24 on 26 December 2009. In the first week of 2010, it feel to number 36. In Ireland, the song debut and peaked at number 31 on 17 December 2009. Over the following two weeks, it fell to number 33, and again to number 48 before exiting the top 50.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, Lewis performed her version on the BBC Radio 2 show \"Live Sessions with Ken Bruce\", as part of a set list which also included \"Bleeding Love\", \"Better In Time\", \"Happy\" and \"I Got You\". She performed an acoustic version of the song on MTV Unplugged in Germany. A reviewer for Neon Limelight felt that her acoustic performance lacked emotion and passion. The singer performed the song again on the sixth series finale of \"The X Factor\" in December 2009. On 21 January 2010, Lewis performed \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" and \"I Got You\" on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Echo\".\n\n\n"}

His best results were the semifinals at the 1985 outdoor Tokyo, 1989 Wellington, and 1989 Schenectady Grand Prix events.\n\nMichibata reached the second round in all four Grand Slam tournaments, but never further. His first Grand Slam appearance was at the 1983 US Open, when he lost in the second round to Pat Cash. His last was also at the US Open in 1991, when he lost in the first round to Nuno Marques. Michibata only played all four Grand Slams in the same year in 1989, reaching the second round at the French Open and US Open and losing in the first round at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.\n\nMichibata had more success as a doubles player. Much of this success came with fellow Canadian Grant Connell, including four titles. In 1990, Michibata and Connell were finalists at the Australian Open. Michibata's highest doubles ranking was #5 on 8 July 1991 after he and Connell reached the semifinals of both the French Open and Wimbledon. Coincidentally, they lost both of these semifinals to John Fitzgerald and Anders Järryd.\n\nMichibata competed for 14 Canadian Davis Cup teams between 1982 and 1992. He went 4 and 10 in singles and 7 and 8 in doubles. The Connell-Michibata pair won a crucial match in a 1990 tie against the Dutchmen Paul Haarhuis and Mark Koevermans 7–6, 7–6, 6–2, as Canada defeated the Netherlands 3–2 in the qualifying round for the 1991 World Group. Unfortunately the Canadian team as well as the Connell-Michibata pairing lost in the first round of the World Group in 1991 as well as the following year, two of the only three times Canada has competed in the World Group since its inception in 1981.\n\nMichibata also competed in Men's Doubles with Grant Connell at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. They were seeded 6th, but lost in the first round to Moreten Christensen and Michael Tauson of Denmark.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Michibata became the director of tennis at Whistler Racquet and Golf Resort in Whistler, British Columbia. Also, Michibata coached the doubles team of fellow Canadian Daniel Nestor and Mark Knowles for two years (1995–1997).\n\nIn 1997, Michibata became an assistant tennis coach at the University of Southern California, staying there until 2000, when he moved to Princeton University to become the head coach of its tennis program. He remained at Princeton for 12 years during which time he had a 145–121 record, including winning records in seven Ivy League seasons, and three Ivy League Players of the Year.\n\nMichibata has remained in the Princeton area, and he is currently director of elite and tournament training for the Princeton Tennis Program, where he coaches many nationally ranked players.\n\nMichibata is married and has a son and a daughter.

He often collaborates with fellow screenwriter Ted Elliott.\n\nRossio was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. After graduating from Saddleback High School in Santa Ana, California, he went on to study at California State University, Fullerton where he received his Bachelor of Arts in Communications, with an emphasis in radio, television and film. He is the founder of Wordplay, also known as Wordplayer.com, one of the premier screenwriting sites on the Internet.\n\nAlong with his writing partner Ted Elliott, Rossio has written some of the most successful American films of the past 30 years, including \"Aladdin\", \"\" and \"Shrek\". He is the second most successful screenwriter of all time in terms of domestic box office receipts with totals at around $2.5 billion.\n\nIn March 2017, Legendary Entertainment announced that Rossio would lead their writers room to help develop the story for \"Godzilla vs Kong\". A press release revealed Rossio as the sole screenwriter for \"Godzilla vs. Kong\".\n\nAs quoted in the India Times, Deadline Hollywood and other sources, \"\"Pirates of the Caribbean\" writer Terry Rossio has been sued by his former agent for pending commission payment of over two years. Dodie Herskovitz, of Dodie Gold Management, filed a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court and claimed the screenwriter has not paid her 'certain revenues' she is owed under their contract, said The Hollywood Reporter. Herskovitz said she became Rossio's manager in February 2002, and their contract entitled her to 10 per cent of gross revenues and other amounts earned from entertainment industry work negotiated by her firm. Rossio, however, ended their contract in March 2013. The former manager claims she managed the writer while he signed to write (with Ted Elliott) installments of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" saga, apart from \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Déjà Vu\" and upcoming projects \"Lightspeed\" and \"Instant Karma\".”\n\nRossio is also associated with the anti-vaccination movement, writing in a tweet from November 23, 2018, \"My heart goes out to all the parents of vaccine damaged children, who have to not only endure the sadness of their loss, but also the vitriol of ill-informed and insensitive people (such as those here). Anti-Vax is equivalent to calling someone a nigger and makes as little sense\". Subsequently, Rossio received a strong backlash from Twitter users for his use of a racist slur, and for comparing defenders of the anti-vaccination movement with victims of racism.\n\n"}

The society is independent and open to all students of the university, but maintains strong links with debating at Glasgow University Union.\n\nThe date of the society's foundation is contested; the earliest paper records of the society are dated before 1770, and there are, moreover, mentions within the university records of a society existing and being open to students who took Logic, back when the university still resided within Glasgow Cathedral. Pope John Paul II issued a 'Papal Letter' to the society upon his visit to Scotland in 1982, which recognised the society's claim to have been established in 1451. The society was formally re-instituted in 1861. The society has led the UK's university debating culture since 1953. In 1955, it won the Observer Mace, now the John Smith Memorial Mace, named after the deceased GUU debater and former leader of the British Labour Party. The GUU has since won the Mace debating championship sixteen more times, far more than any other university. The GUU has also won the World Universities Debating Championships five times.\n\nThe society organises a variety of events during term-time, including weekly informal Thursday debates at the Queen Margaret Union. In October, the society holds a New Members' Dinner, followed in March by the annual dinner (this year it will be held on 25 February as a special anniversary celebration), held shortly before the AGM. There is also an Inter-Board Debate, held between the boards of the four major student bodies (Glasgow University Union, Queen Margaret Union, Students' Representative Council and Glasgow University Sports Association), and the Honorary President's Debate, as well as a St Andrews-tide football game and a Sports Day, the Dialectic Olympics. The society holds a number of more informal events, especially during Freshers' Week, to attract new members.\n\nThree internal competitions are organised by the society: the Reftable, for new speakers; the Intra-Varsity, a pro-am competition; and the John Duncan Debate, between incoming and outgoing club leaders of the Glasgow University Union's Parliamentary Clubs.\n\nThe Dialectic Society, along with the Glasgow University Medico-Chirurgical Society and Glasgow University Athletic Club, was one of the founding societies of the Glasgow University Union in 1885, as well as being instrumental in establishing the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council the following year, and remains an active contributor to the activities of both organisations. The GUU was originally an all-male organisation, having been established before the admission of women to the university in 1892. At this time, women were educated at Queen Margaret College, and opportunities for women students to debate existed at the Queen Margaret Union. This activity largely ceased following the admission of women to the GUU in 1980; however, the Dialectic Society has recently been involved in a number of events aimed at its revival.\n\nThe management of the society is entrusted to a board elected at the annual general meeting (AGM). The board consists of a president, vice-president, honorary secretary, honorary treasurer, assistant honorary secretary, whip secretary, publicity secretary, macer, social convenor, welfare officer, charity officer and two ordinary members. The convenors of debates of the Glasgow University Union and Queen Margaret Union and the society's immediate past president are also \"ex officio\" members of the board. The president, vice-president, honorary secretary, honorary treasurer and assistant honorary secretary form the executive.\n\nSome quirks of the electoral procedure at the AGM are that posts are filled in descending order, allowing those who failed to win more important posts to stand for others, and that candidates must leave the room while a vote is taken on them. The AGM was traditionally held at the end of the university's Candlemas Term, around the middle of March. Despite the new semester-based structure of the university's academic year, this remains the case and the AGM is now held shortly before the end of the teaching period of the second semester, which is separated from the exam period by the Easter vacation.\n\nThe society at its AGM also elects an honorary president, up to eight honorary vice-presidents and honorary life members. The current honorary president is Noel Peacock (emeritus professor of the University of Glasgow School of Modern Languages).\n\nOne of the honorary president's duties is to chair the Honorary President's Debate, held in February each year. Some years this is a debate organised on a special topic, but other years it is the same event as the Inter-board debate. between representatives of the boards of the four main student bodies at the university: the Glasgow University Union, the Queen Margaret Union, the Sports Association and the Students' Representative Council.

The play centers on Jake, a writer with a struggling marriage. Jake talks to many of the women he knows, both in real life and in his imagination, as he works to save his marriage. Jake, suffering with psychosis and seeing representations of his daughter at age 12, his late wife Julie and recently divorced wife Maggie, is dealing with the inability to write productively and must resolve these issues before he does so.\n\n\"Jake's Women\" opened on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theater on March 24, 1992 and closed on October 25, 1992 after 245 performances and 14 previews. Directed by Gene Saks, the cast featured Alan Alda (Jake), Helen Shaver (Maggie), Brenda Vaccaro (Karen), Kate Burton (Julie), Joyce Van Patten (Edith), Tracy Pollan (Molly at 21), and Talia Balsam (Sheila). The sets and costumes were by Santo Loquasto and the lighting by Tharon Musser.\n\nAlan Alda was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.\n\n\"Jake's Women\" premiered at the Old Globe Theatre (San Diego, California) in March 1990, running through April, starring Peter Coyote with direction by Jack O'Brien. According to Simon, after that production closed he re-wrote \"70 percent\", and the role of Jake was re-cast with Alan Alda with a new director, Gene Saks. The role of Jake was re-written, according to Simon: \"Jake used to just react to the other people...now he's the centerpiece.\"\n\nPrior to its Broadway opening, \"Jake's Women\" was staged at the Stevens Center in Winston-Salem as part of the North Carolina School of the Arts Broadway Preview Series. The show, starring Alan Alda, had 19 sold-out performances.\n\nIn 2016 \"Jake's Women\" was staged at Beit Zvi Theatre in Ramat Gan, Israel.\n\nAct One:\nJake is a successful writer living in New York in 1990. His marriage to wife Maggie is beginning to fall apart. We begin by seeing Jake on stage typing, then, interrupted by a phone call he gets into an argument with sister Karen about meeting up on Saturday night for dinner. After hanging up, an imaginary Maggie 'appears', stating he's always working and he's so busy she doesn't even know why he thought of her. Jake then persuades her to act out the scene in which they met eight years ago at a July fourth party. Maggie plays along for a bit before interrupting the fantasy, stating that the past is not helping them get through the future. Jake expresses his disappointment, and Maggie leaves.\n\nJake then confides in the audience in how his marriage is in trouble, before calling on his sister Karen to help him. Karen 'appears' and expresses her irritation at his calling her while she was watching The Godfather I, II and III. \nJake explains that he and Maggie are in trouble, and he believes that she has been having an affair with a new man in her office. Karen aggravates him into admitting he had an affair with an actress a year ago before explaining he loves Maggie more than ever and would do anything to keep her. Maggie then arrives home and has just started upstairs for a shower when Jake explains he wishes to speak to her before dinner. Maggie goes to the bathroom, and Karen warns him not to cause trouble for him. She then leaves.\n\nMaggie enters and begins to fix herself a drink, and Jake explains that they are going to dinner with Karen on Saturday before Maggie interrupts, stating she has to go to Philadelphia on Saturday. This then leads to an argument between the two, leading Jake to ask, \"Do you want out of this marriage?\" Stunned, Maggie expresses her wish to stay with him before another argument ensues, with Maggie telling Jake he is controlling and spends more time on his work than with her. She then proposes that they separate for six months to give them some breathing space.\nAs Maggie begins to leave the room, Jake asks her if 'Michael Jaffe' has anything to do with the separation. He interrogates Maggie until she admits she has slept with Michael, but it wasn't an affair because \"it stopped as soon as it started.\" Maggie then leaves the room.\n\nAs Jake is sitting there miserably, his daughter Molly, age twelve, \"appears\" and begins to talk to him. When asking him if he and Maggie are separating because they both had an affair, Jake violently expresses his reluctance to discuss such matters with a young girl, stating that if she were older, he would discuss it. Younger Molly then agrees, exits, and is replaced by Molly at age twenty one. Older Molly tells her father that the problems between him and Maggie are caused by Julie, Jake's late wife and Molly's mother. Molly then persuades Jake to talk to his psychiatrist in his mind, stating it'll give him complete control - his favourite thing in life. Jake agrees and Molly exits.\n\nEdith, Jake's psychiatrist then enters, mocking Jake and his problems. She taunts him and gives seemingly useless advice, stating that he \"likes to deprive himself.\" Eventually, she coerces him into saying what he wants the most, which he says is Julie.\nJulie then appears, at age twenty one, doing a crossword puzzle and asking Jake for the answers. An ice cream truck is then heard and Julie exits.\n\nJake then continues to talk to Edith, getting angrier and angrier at her as she continuously taunts and mocks him. Maggie then enters and Jake fixes her a drink, Edith 'fades out' while telling Jake that he always has options and to listen to his wife. Jake and Maggie then launch into a discussion of how Maggie can't seem to stop \"running.\" She explains that she needs time for herself, and after six months they will see if things are any better. Jake scornfully remarks that \"you can't keep what you give up,\" and Maggie tells him that Jake never let Julie go, despite her death. We find out that Maggie has been pregnant several times, but evidently has had miscarriages. Maggie then exits.\n\nJake confides in the audience that he has tried to let Julie go, and she is always \"bursting in on him.\" Julie, age twenty one then appears, yelling angrily and demanding to know where he has been. Jake is confused until Julie states that they have slept together the previous night. Jake explains to her that it wasn't a late night, and it was twenty-nine years ago. Julie begins to understand that time has passed before stating, \"last night was wonderful.\" Jake then explains to her that they could never be together as they once were, and Julie, horrified, asks him if he is dead.\n\nJake calls on Karen to help him explain to Julie her death. Then Julie expresses her relief, telling Jake, \"I hate it when somebody I love dies.\" Julie then expresses her irritation at the fact that Jake only calls her when he's in trouble. Edith appears and she and Karen help support Julie's argument. Julie asks Jake to make her thirty-six, but when he tells her he can't, she begins to fade out in annoyance. Jake finally tells her that she never was thirty-six, that she died in a car accident when she was thirty-five while taking Molly up to camp. Edith and Karen leave. At first, Julie is confused as to who Molly is but then realizes she has a daughter. After Jake shows her a photo Julie expresses her wish to see Molly, asking Jake to summon her up. Jake refuses, but eventually agrees to let Molly and Julie meet on Julie's \"birthday.\" Molly calls and Jake speaks to her, with Julie exiting.\n\nJake hangs up and tells the audience how Molly is the only human he ever trusted. He then reminisces about the time when Molly and Maggie met eight years ago. A younger Maggie then enters expressing her apologies for being late. She and Jake then chat about going out to dinner before Maggie kisses him just as Molly enters. Molly and Maggie exchange greetings and Maggie hands her a present, which turns out to be an out of date World Atlas. Maggie, embarrassed, admits she grabbed it without looking. Molly then exits, to turn off her TV, and Maggie expresses her joy. She then leaves to the bathroom. Molly enters and tells Jake that he and Maggie should marry straight away. A phone is then heard and Molly leaves.\n\nPresent Maggie enters and states she is staying at the beach house. She then exits the apartment. Jake gloomily sits on the couch before both Mollys, age twelve and twenty one, appear and sit with him. They try to play a game but it ends up relating back to Maggie, so they simply sit.\n\nAct Two:\nBegins with Jake, once again, seated at his computer typing. Maggie enters seductively and expresses her wish to be with him again, before laughing in his face. It is realized that Maggie is only a hallucination and she leaves. Jake confides in the audience on how his imaginary women are appearing without his summons, before Karen enters, asking to speak with him.\n\nKaren and Jake get into an argument over his relationships and it is found that he has had several relationships in the six months that Maggie has been gone. He is currently with a woman named Shelia. Edith arrives and together, she and Karen irritate him. Jake realizes they are \"really there\" and calls Edith in order to help get rid of the hallucinations. Karen and Edith then leave. Jake tells the audience he never called Edith—that it was a trick to get rid of Karen and Edith in his head.\n\nThe doorbell rings and Shelia enters. She and Jake have a strange conversation in which Jake's insanity starts to become clear. Maggie then appears and begins to mock Jake from behind Shelia's back. Jake grows angry with Maggie, frequently shouting at her, with Shelia (who cannot see Maggie) growing frightened. She eventually runs out of the house screaming.\n\nAfter an Imaginary reunion between Julie and Molly, the real Maggie returns to talk with Jake. She informs him that she has dinner plans with someone and that she believes that person is going to propose, leading to an argument between Jake and Maggie, and eventually Maggie's departure.\n\nSuddenly, Jake hears the voice of his late mother. She informs him of her forgiveness and love of him and then disappears. Then all of the other imaginary characters reappear and say goodbye to Jake. The real Maggie then enters and announces that she canceled the dinner date. She wants to work things out with Jake. Jake walks towards her and they reach out towards each other like The Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. The lights fade to black.\n\nIn 1996, the play was made into a TV movie starring Alan Alda with direction by Glenn Jordan. Both Alda and Van Patten were brought in from the original cast to reprise respectively the roles of Jake and Edith.\n\n"}

He was also a noted biographer of Rupert Brooke (1964, Faber and Faber) and Edward Marsh (1958, James Tait Black Memorial Prize 1959).\n\nHassall was born in London and educated at St Michael's College, Tenbury, Brighton College and Wadham College, Oxford. He was the son of the illustrator John Hassall and brother of Joan Hassall, who engraved the title page of his book of poetry, \"Devil's Dyke\", published in 1936. Hassall married the actress Eve Lynett, with whom he had a son and a daughter, the actress Imogen Hassall.\n\nHassall was an experienced actor serving as Ivor Novello's understudy in a minor London drama when Novello invited him to provide the lyrics for a new musical. Their successful collaboration for \"Glamorous Night\" (1935) (\"Shine Through My Dreams\", \"Fold Your Wings\") began a fifteen-year partnership that included six long-running hits. ('Perchance to Dream' the other hit which Novello wrote during this period, had lyrics by Novello himself). While their musicals delighted West End audiences, they were judged \"too British\" for America. Jeremy Northam, who played a character based on Ivor Novello in the 2001 Robert Altman movie, \"Gosford Park\", sang \"I Can Give You the Starlight\" from \"The Dancing Years\", Hassall's and Novello's 1939 musical.\n\nDuring World War II in 1940, Hassall served in an anti-aircraft gun emplacement with editor John Guest, architect Denys Lasdun, and socialite Angus Menzies. A man of many talents, he recorded a record album entitled \"Great Voices Read Poetry\" (1954-1955) along with Richard Burton, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, Robert Hardy, and Anthony Quayle. Hassall's contributions included: Upon Westminster Bridge, Daffodils, and Ode: Intimations of Immortality by William Wordsworth; and Death Be Not Proud by John Donne.\n\nHassall lived at Tonford Manor, a house with a mediaeval stone tower situated by the River Stour on the outskirts of Canterbury. He delighted in its fine prospect and had a road named after him in the community. At St Nicholas's Church in nearby Thanington is a small pane of glass engraved in his memory. Shortly before his death in 1963, Hassall spoke about the first Stour Music Festival, saying:\nThe shared experience … a communion between listener and performer … impossible in a great assembly … (which) means the restoration of a large body of music to the private salon or to the church where it originally belonged. With the appropriate setting and a perceptive audience of proportionate size, the work will not only sound, but feel right.\n\nHassall died on a train at Rochester, Kent, on 25 April 1963 after suffering a heart attack whilst running for the train to see his daughter Imogen appear in a Royal Ballet School performance at Covent Garden. He was 51.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915745", "title": "Back-fire", "text": "Back-fire\n\nA backfire is combustion or an explosion produced by a running internal combustion engine that occurs in the exhaust system rather than inside the combustion chamber. Unburnt fuel that is ignited in the exhaust system can produce loud sounds even if flames are not present at the tailpipe. This is called an afterburn or backfire since an backfire occurs in the exhaust system. A visible flame may momentarily shoot out of the exhaust pipe under some conditions. Either condition may cause a loud popping noise and usually indicates an improperly tuned engine.\n\nA common cause of backfire is from running rich (too much fuel going into cylinders), or faulty ignition possibly a fouled (dirty) spark plug, coil, or plug wire. A \"pop-back\" (inlet manifold, carburetor/throttle body, or air cleaner) of an internal combustion engine can occur when the valves are not shutting correctly.\n\nThe term derives from parallel experiences with early unreliable firearms or ammunition, in which the explosive force was directed out at the breech instead of the muzzle. From this came the use of the word \"backfire\" as a verb to indicate something that produces an unintended, unexpected, and undesired result.\n\nBackfiring in internal combustion engines occurs outside of the combustion chamber, and may be the result of an improper air to fuel ratio or poor ignition. The burnt fuel then enters the intake system, causing the air fuel mixture in the intake system to combust. \n\nPop-backs may also occur before the combustion chamber. One possible cause of this is timing. If the timing is too early, the spark plug fires before the intake valves close, causing the combustion to propagate into the intake manifold, further igniting the air-fuel mixture there; the resulting explosion then travels out of the carburetor and air filter. On many small marine engines, a screen is placed over the intake of the carburetor as a flame arrestor, to prevent these flames from escaping the intake and potentially igniting fuel or fuel vapors in the enclosed sump or bilge of the boat, causing a fire or explosion. Alternatively, the ignition timing may be late, in which case the combustion is not completed by the time the exhaust valves open, allowing the combustion to propagate into the exhaust system.\n\nAdditionally, improperly adjusted carburetors that create a lean condition during acceleration can cause the air–fuel mixture to burn so slowly that combustion is still taking place during the exhaust stroke, and even when the intake valve opens. The flame front can then travel up the intake and cause a popback. In this situation it is conceivable that there is a popback occurring in the intake manifold and exhaust manifold simultaneously.\n\nIn both cases (combustion occurring \"before\" and \"after\" the combustion chamber), the result is a sharp pop, which is colloquially referred to as a \"backfire\". However, for troubleshooting, engine mechanics more strictly define an ignition of fuel within the engine \"exhaust\" system as a \"backfire\", while a \"popback\" is this same process taking place in the \"induction\" system.\n\nExhaust system backfires occur in engines that have an emission system malfunction, like an air injection system diverter valve problem, an exhaust leak, or when the catalytic converter has been removed. In some high-performance vehicles, when a driver shifts up and lets off the accelerator, the engine has a moment of running rich. This causes an incomplete burn which causes the fumes to explode in the exhaust system along with an audible pop or bang sound. This is a result of working equipment, and is unlikely to cause damage.\n\nA fuel-injected engine may backfire if an intake leak is present (causing the engine to run lean), or a fuel injection component such as an air-flow sensor is defective.\n\nCommon causes of backfires are:\n\nWith older engine designs, backfiring can be common or unavoidable. Backfire is rare in modern vehicles with fuel-injection and computer-controlled fuel mixtures.\n\nCars with sports exhausts (both factory-fitted and aftermarket) are much more likely to backfire. In some circumstances the backfire is seen as an additional perk of the car. The TVR Cerbera is an example of a car with factory-fitted sports exhausts which produce frequent backfires on engine braking.\n\nIn high-powered supercharged aircraft piston engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon, backfiring into the inlet manifold is prevented with flame traps inside the manifold, the traps preventing the flame propagating into the compressed air/fuel mixture within the manifold.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915750", "title": "Moroccan architecture", "text": "Moroccan architecture\n\nMoroccan architecture refers to the architecture characteristic of Morocco throughout its history and up to modern times. The country's diverse geography and long history, marked by successive waves of settlers through both migration and military conquest, are all reflected in its architecture. This architectural heritage ranges from ancient Roman and Berber sites to 20th-century colonial and modern architecture.\n\nThe most recognizably \"Moroccan\" architecture, however, is the traditional architecture that developed in the Islamic period (7th century and after) which dominates much of Morocco's documented history and its existing heritage. This \"Islamic architecture\" of Morocco was part of a wider cultural and artistic complex, often referred to as \"Hispano-Moorish\" art, which characterized Morocco, al-Andalus (Muslim Spain and Portugal), and parts of Algeria and even Tunisia. It blended influences from Berber culture in North Africa, pre-Islamic Spain (Roman, Byzantine, and Visigothic), and contemporary artistic currents in the Islamic Middle East to elaborate a unique style over centuries with recognizable features such as the \"Moorish\" arch, \"riad\" gardens (courtyard gardens with a symmetrical four-part division), and elaborate geometric and arabesque motifs in wood, stucco, and tilework (notably \"zellij\").\n\nAlthough Moroccan Berber architecture is not strictly separate from the rest of Moroccan architecture, many structures and architectural styles are distinctively associated with traditionally Berber or Berber-dominated regions of Morocco such as the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara and pre-Sahara regions. These mostly rural regions are marked by numerous kasbahs (fortresses) and \"ksour\" (fortified villages) shaped by local geography and social structures, of which one of the most famous is Ait Benhaddou. They are typically made of rammed earth and decorated with local geometric motifs. Far from being isolated from other historical artistic currents around them, the Berbers of Morocco (and across North Africa) adapted the forms and ideas of Islamic architecture to their own conditions and in turn contributed to the formation of Western Islamic art, particularly during their political domination of the region over the centuries of Almoravid, Almohad, and Marinid rule.\n\nAlthough less well-documented, Morocco's earliest historical periods were dominated by the indigenous Berber populations (still present today), up to the Berber kingdoms of Mauretania. Roman occupation and settlement was much less extensive than in other nearby regions like Hispania or \"Africa\" (Tunisia) but nonetheless left notable sites such as Volubilis, which acted as an important early urban center.\n\nIn the early 8th century the region became steadily integrated into the emerging Muslim world, beginning with military incursions of Musa ibn Nusayr and becoming more definitive with the advent of the Idrisid dynasty at the end of that century. The arrival of Islam was extremely significant as it developed a new set of societal norms (although some of them were familiar to Judeo-Christian societies) and institutions which therefore shaped, to some extent, the types of buildings being built and the aesthetic or spiritual values that guided their design.\n\nThe Idrisids founded the city of Fes, which became their capital and the major political and cultural center of early Islamic Morocco. In this early period Morocco also absorbed waves of immigrants from Tunisia and al-Andalus (Muslim-ruled Spain and Portugal), who brought in cultural and artistic influences from their home countries. The earliest well-known Islamic-era monuments in Morocco, such as the al-Qarawiyyin and Andalusi mosques in Fes, were built in the hypostyle form and made early use of the horseshoe or \"Moorish\" arch. These reflected early influences from major monuments like the Great Mosque of Kairouan and the Great Mosque of Cordoba. In the 10th century much of northern Morocco came directly within the sphere of influence of the Ummayyad Caliphate of Cordoba, with competition from the Fatimid Caliphate further east. Early contributions to Moroccan architecture from this period include expansions to the Qarawiyyin and Andalusi mosques and the addition of their square-shafted minarets, anticipating the later standard form of Moroccan minarets.\n\nThe collapse of the Cordoban caliphate in the early 11th century was followed by the significant advance of Christian kingdoms into Muslim al-Andalus and the rise of major Berber empires in Morocco. The latter included first the Almoravids (11th-12th centuries) and then the Almohads (12th-13th centuries), both of whom also took control of remaining Muslim territory in al-Andalus, creating empires that stretched across large parts of western and northern Africa and into Europe. This period is considered one of the most formative stages of Moroccan and Moorish architecture, establishing many of the forms and motifs that were refined in subsequent centuries. These two empires were responsible for establishing a new imperial capital at Marrakesh and the Almohads also began construction of a monumental capital in Rabat. The Almoravids adopted the architectural developments of al-Andalus, such as the complex interlacing arches of the Great Mosque in Cordoba and of the Aljaferia palace in Zaragoza, while also introducing new ornamental techniques from the east such as \"muqarnas\" (\"stalactite\" or \"honeycomb\" carvings). The Almohad Kutubiyya and Tinmel mosques are often considered the prototypes of later Moroccan mosques. The monumental minarets (e.g. the Kutubiyya minaret, the Giralda of Seville, and the Hassan Tower of Rabat) and ornamental gateways (e.g. Bab Agnaou in Marrakesh, and Bab Oudaia and Bab er-Rouah in Rabat) of the Almohad period also established the overall decorative schemes that became recurrent in these architectural elements thenceforth. The minaret of the Kasbah Mosque of Marrakech was particularly influential and set a style that was repeated, with minor elaborations, in the following Marinid period.\n\nThe Berber Marinid dynasty that followed was also important in further refining the artistic legacy established by their predecessors. Based in Fes, they built monuments with increasingly intricate and extensive decoration, particularly in wood and stucco. They were also the first to deploy extensive use of \"zellij\" (mosaic tilework in complex geometric patterns). Notably, they were the first to build madrasas, a type of institution which originated in Iran and had spread west. The madrasas of Fes, such as the Bou Inania, al-Attarine, and as-Sahrij madrasas, as well as the Marinid madrasa of Salé and the other Bou Inania in Meknes, are considered among the greatest architectural works of this period. While mosque architecture largely followed the Almohad model, one noted change was the progressive increase in the size of the \"sahn\" or courtyard, which was previously a minor element of the floor plan but which eventually, in the subsequent Saadian period, became as large as the main prayer hall, and sometimes larger.\n\nThe architectural style under the Marinids was very closely related to that found in the Emirate of Granada, in Spain, under the contemporary Nasrid dynasty. The decoration of the famous Alhambra is thus reminiscent of what was built in Fes at the same time. When Granada was conquered in 1492 by Catholic Spain and the last Muslim realm of al-Andalus came to an end, many of the remaining Spanish Muslims (and Jews) fled to Morocco and North Africa, further increasing the Andalusian influence in these regions in subsequent generations. \n\nAfter the Marinids came the Saadian dynasty, which marked a political shift from Berber-led empires to sultanates led by Arab sharifian dynasties. Artistically and architecturally, however, there was broad continuity and the Saadians are seen by modern scholars as continuing to refine the existing Moroccan-Moorish style, with some considering the Saadian Tombs in Marrakesh as one of the apogees of this style. \n\nStarting with the Saadians, and continuing with the Alaouites (their successors and the reigning monarchy today), Moroccan art and architecture is portrayed by modern scholars as having remained essentially \"conservative\"; meaning that it continued to reproduce the existing style with high fidelity but did not introduce major new innovations. Many of the mosques and palaces standing in Morocco today have been built or restored by the Alaouites at some point or another. Ornate architectural elements from Saadian buildings, most famously from their lavish el-Badi Palace in Marrakesh, were also stripped and reused in buildings elsewhere during the reign of Moulay Isma'il (1672–1727). Moulay Isma'il is also notable for having built a vast imperial capital in Meknes, where the remains of his monumental structures can still be seen today. Up until the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Alaouite sultans and their ministers continued to build beautiful palaces, many of which are now used as museums or tourist attractions, such as the Bahia Palace in Marrakesh or the Dar Batha in Fes.\n\nIn the 20th century, Moroccan architecture and cities were also shaped by the period of French colonial control (1912-1956). This stage introduced new architectural styles (such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco), especially in the \"Villes Nouvelles\" (\"New Cities\" founded by the French administration), in addition to European ideas about urban planning imposed by colonial authorities. The European architects and planners also drew on traditional Moroccan architecture to develop a style sometimes referred to as \"Mauresque\" (similar to Neo-Moorish), blending contemporary European architecture with a \"pastiche\" of traditional Moroccan architecture.\n\nStructures such as \"agadirs\" (fortified granaries) and \"qsūr\" or qsars (fortified villages) are prominent traditional features of Amazigh architecture in Morocco.\n\nThe conversion of the Berber tribes in Morocco to Islam by Idris I of Morocco greatly influenced the overall architectural style of the country. The elegance of Islamic features is blended in and adapted into buildings and interior designs such as the use of tiling, fountains, geometric design and floral motifs. Which could be seen in mosques, palaces, plazas as well as homes. The materials chosen for the interiors of Moroccan classical architecture, are due in part to the necessity of cooling in the arid land climate of Morocco.\n\nMoroccan Islamic architecture is not confined to the country. For example, Sheikha Salama Mosque in the UAE city of Al Ain has two minarets which partly look Moroccan.\n\nModern day Spain was a Moorish domain from the early 8th century to the late 15th century and was known as Al-Andalus 711 to 1492. During the 11th century the berber dynasty of the Almohad Caliphate, ruled Morocco and the southern part of modern-day Spain the most famous of their remaining buildings are the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh, the Giralda of Seville, Spain and the Hassan Tower, in Rabat, Morocco. The Almoravid dynasty ruled Morocco and the southern half of Spain through the 12th century. The Marinid dynasty from the 13th through the 15th century, rule both Moroccan and Southern Spain until the Reconquista with the fall of Granada in 1492, effectively ending the Moorish era in Iberia. Moorish architecture therefore evolved into a distinct form. The elements of which are as follows:\n\nThe Treaty of Fes established the French Protectorate in 1912. The French resident general Hubert Lyautey appointed Henri Prost to oversee the urban development of cities under his control. In April 1914, the colonial government promulgated a \"dahir\" for the \"arrangement, development, and extension of urban plans, easements, and road tolls\". This \"dahir\" included building standards which directly affected the architecture at that time, as follows:\n\n\nThe building regulations maintained the country's preexisting architectural features and balanced the rapid urbanization.\n\nOne of the most common types of construction in Morocco, especially for city walls, was rammed earth, an ancient building technique found across the Near East, Africa, and beyond. It is also known as \"pisé\" (from French) or \"tabia\" (from Arabic). The ramparts of Fes, Marrakesh, and Rabat, for example, were made with this process, even though some notable structures (like monumental gates) were also built in stone. It generally made use of local materials and was widely used thanks to its low cost and relative efficiency. This material consisted of mud and soil of varying consistency (everything from smooth clay to rocky soil) usually mixed with other materials such as straw or lime to aid adhesion. The addition of lime also made the walls harder and more resistant overall, although this varied locally as some areas had soil which hardened well on its own while others did not. (For example, the walls of Fes and nearby Meknes contain up to 47% lime versus around 17% in Marrakesh and 12% in Rabat.) The technique is still in use today, though the composition and ratio of these materials has continued to change over time as some materials (like clay) have become relatively more costly than others (like gravel).\n\nThe walls were built from bottom to top one level at a time. Workers pressed and packed in the materials into sections ranging from 50 and 70 cm in length that were each held together temporarily by wooden boards. Once the material was settled, the wooden restraints could be removed and the process was repeated on top of the previously completed level. This process of initial wooden scaffolding often leaves traces in the form of multiple rows of little holes visible across the face of the walls. In many cases walls were covered with a coating of lime, stucco, or other material to give them a smooth surface and to better protect the main structure.\n\nThis type of construction required consistent maintenance and upkeep, as the materials are relatively permeable and are more easily eroded by rain over time; in parts of Morocco, (especially near the Sahara) kasbahs and other structures made with a less durable composition (typically lacking lime) can begin to crumble apart in less than a couple of decades after they've been abandoned. As such, old structures of this type remain intact only insofar as they are continuously restored; some stretches of wall today appear brand new due to regular maintenance, while others are crumbling.\n\nArches, most often the horseshoe arch are used in almost every aspect of Moroccan housing whether it is doors, entrances, windows or niches.\n\nDomes are often integrated with altars or commemorative monuments as well as modern villas.\n\nThe interior doors of villas are usually oversized and decorative. In contrast, very small doors are used in dars. Doors are often adorned with delicate metal work, carving or color.\n\nIn contrast with doors, windows in Moroccan architecture are often unremarkable. They are normally arched glass panes with fewer adornments compared to doors.\n\nMashrabiya is an Islamic dowel work, made by carving large wood partitions in elaborate geometric patterns. Its purpose is to conceal the women from the visitor’s prying eyes according to Islamic tradition.\n\nThe fountain is a conspicuous feature in every house, often made of marble or cement. It is built in the heart of the courtyard, living room or guest room.\n\nWoodwork can be found in both urbanized and more traditional areas of Morocco. The woodwork serves as the main finishing. This intricate woodwork can be found on various surfaces of buildings especially the interiors, such as wall, ceiling window, gallery and balcony. The wood itself does not need to be finished or painted after the long process of delicate carving.\n\nThe plaster used for sculpting is called \"gabs\" or \"jybs\" in Moroccan, with the gypsum extracted abundantly from quarries in Safi, Asni, Meknes and Ouazzane. Tadelakt, qadad, and non-waterproof plasters are used. They may be polished smooth or elaborately carved into yeseria.\n\nCopper, bronze, iron and brass are materials commonly used for studs, door knobs, window frames and door frames as well as room partitions.\n\nA wide variety of ceramics is produced in Morocco. The painted and glazed ceramics are used for architectural work and tableware. Some are commonly used as roof tiling and decorative zellige tilework. The process of tiling, arranging and cutting them requires expertise in order to deliver a detailed piece of work.\n\nMorocco is known for its vivid and colorful design. However, the diversity of colors that are included in the design all holds different connotations. \n\nThe Riad also known as Dar is the Moroccan traditional house, which normally has two or more storeys around a courtyard.\n\nVillas are larger stand-alone housing in the urbanized area which do not need to follow traditional architectural style.\n\n"}

It contains functions for interacting with an X server. These functions allow programmers to write programs without knowing the details of the protocol. Few applications use Xlib directly; rather, they employ other libraries that use Xlib functions to provide widget toolkits:\n\nXlib appeared around 1985, and is currently used in GUIs for many Unix-like operating systems. The XCB library is an attempt to replace Xlib. While Xlib is still used in some environments, modern versions of the X.org server implement Xlib on top of XCB.\n\nThe main types of data in Xlib are the codice_1 structure and the types of the identifiers.\n\nInformally, a display is a physical or virtual device where graphical operations are done. The codice_1 structure of the Xlib library contains information about the display, but more importantly it contains information relative to the channel between the client and the server. For example, in a Unix-like operating system, the codice_1 structure contains the file handle of the socket of this channel (this can be retrieved using the codice_4 macro.) Most Xlib functions have a codice_1 structure as an argument because they either operate on the channel or are relative to a specific channel. In particular, all Xlib functions that interact with the server need this structure for accessing the channel. Some other functions need this structure, even if they operate locally, because they operate on data relative to a specific channel. Operations of this kind include for example operations on the event queue, which is described below.\n\nWindows, colormaps, etc. are managed by the server, which means that the data about their actual implementation is all stored in the server. The client operates on these objects by using their \"identifiers\". The client cannot directly operate on an object, but can only request the server to perform the operation specifying the identifier of the object.\n\nThe types codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, etc. are all identifiers, which are 32-bit integers (just as in the X11 protocol itself). A client 'creates' a window by requesting that the server create a window. This is done via a call to an Xlib function that returns an identifier for the window, that is, a number. This identifier can then be used by the client for requesting other operations on the same window to the server.\n\nThe identifiers are unique to the server. Most of them can be used by different applications to refer to the same objects. For example, two applications connecting with the same server use the same identifier to refer to the same window. These two applications use two different channels, and therefore have two different Display structures; however, when they request operations on the same identifier, these operations will be done on the same object.\n\nThe Xlib functions that send requests to the server usually do not send these requests immediately but store them in a buffer, called the \"request buffer\". The term \"request\" in this case refers to the request from the client that is directed to the server: the request buffer can contain all kinds of requests to the server, not only those having a visible effect on the screen. The request buffer is guaranteed to be flushed (i.e., all requests done so far are sent to the server) after a call to the functions codice_10 or codice_11, after a call to a function that returns a value from the server (these functions block until the answer is received), and in some other conditions. \n\nXlib stores the received events in a queue. The client application can inspect and retrieve events from the queue. While the X server sends events asynchronously, applications using the Xlib library are required to explicitly call Xlib functions for accessing the events in the queue. Some of these functions may block; in this case, they also flush the request buffer.\n\nErrors are instead received and treated asynchronously: the application can provide an error handler that will be called whenever an error message from the server is received.\n\nThe content of a window is not guaranteed to be preserved if the window or one of its parts are made not visible. In this case, the application are sent an codice_12 event when the window of one part of it is made visible again. The application is then supposed to draw the window content again.\n\nThe functions in the Xlib library can be grouped in:\n\nThe following program creates a window with a little black square in it:\nint main(void)\n\nThe client creates a connection with the server by calling codice_13. It then requests the creation of a window with codice_26. A separate call to codice_27 is necessary for mapping the window, that is, for making it visible on the screen.\n\nThe square is drawn by calling codice_28. This operation can only be performed after the window is created. However, performing it once may not be enough. Indeed, the content of the window is not always guaranteed to be preserved. For example, if the window is covered and then uncovered again, its content might require being redrawn. The program is informed that the window or a part of it has to be drawn by the reception of an codice_12 event.\n\nThe drawing of the window content is therefore made inside the loop handling the events. Before entering this loop, the events the application is interested in are selected, in this case with codice_30. The event loop waits for an incoming event: if this event is a key press, the application exits; if it is an expose event, the window content is drawn. The function codice_18 blocks and flushes the request buffer if there is no event in the queue.\n\nXlib does not provide support for buttons, menus, scrollbars, etc. Such widgets are provided by other libraries, which in turn use Xlib. There are two kinds of such libraries:\n\nApplications using any of these widget libraries typically specify the content of the window before entering the main loop and do not need to explicitly handle codice_12 events and redraw the window content.\n\nThe XCB library is an alternative to Xlib. Its two main aims are: reduction in library size and direct access to the X11 protocol. A modification of Xlib has been produced to use XCB as a low-level layer.\n\n"}

Her grandfather, John Hassall, and her aunt, Joan Hassall, worked as illustrators, while her father, Christopher Hassall, was a poet and lyricist. She had a brother. Her godfather is said to have been the composer Ivor Novello, with whom her father had worked extensively as lyricist. Yet on occasion Imogen would proudly claim that this distinction was Sir William Walton's with whom her father had collaborated in the early 1950s, quietly denied by Lady Walton.\n\nImogen boarded and attended Elmhurst Ballet School, Camberley 1952–1954 and the Royal Ballet School, White Lodge, Richmond Park 1955–1958. Later in 1958 (aged 16) she studied in New York City, then returned to live with family in the Vale of Health by Hampstead Heath, London. She continued her absorption of the theatre mode with study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art 1960–1962, following which she joined the company of the Royal Shakespeare Company for one season. After enjoying an appearance in the William Douglas-Home comedy \"The Reluctant Peer\" at the Duchess Theatre in 1964, she appeared in British TV adventure series of the 1960s such as \"The Saint\", \"The Avengers\" and \"The Persuaders!\" In her first significant film role, she played Tara in \"The Long Duel\" (1967). She gained further public notice as a dominant cave-girl in \"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\" (1970) and played major roles in \"Carry On Loving\" and the cult horror film \"Incense for the Damned\" the same year. In 1973, she appeared in \"White Cargo\" alongside David Jason.\n\nHassall was married to actor Kenneth Ives, and before they were married, they had a daughter called Melanie Ives Hassall, who died four days after being born in 1972. She was briefly married to Andrew Knox (an actor who appeared in \"Doctor on the Go\" and who later committed suicide in 1987) but they separated after a few months of marriage, and she lost the baby she was expecting.\n\nHassall's private life was a regular subject of interest in tabloid newspapers. She was known for playing sexy, scantily clad characters in film and on TV. This, and the revealing outfits she wore at film premieres, resulted in her being referred to as the \"Countess of Cleavage\".\n\nAfter her failed relationships, the death of her child, her miscarriage, and her career decline, she became depressed. Following previous suicide attempts, she was found dead in her Wimbledon home on the morning of 16 November 1980, when she failed to meet a friend, the actress Suzanna Leigh, with whom she was due to go on holiday to Mombasa that day. She had apparently committed suicide by overdosing on Tuinal tablets. She was interred in Gap Road Cemetery, Wimbledon, London.\n\nHer appearance in the film \"Carry On Loving\" (1970) led many years later to her being portrayed as a character in the play \"Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick\" written by Terry Johnson. The play was produced at the Royal National Theatre in September 1998 and received the Olivier Award 1999 for Best New Comedy. Hassall was played by Gina Bellman. Johnson later adapted the play for a 2000 television film \"Cor, Blimey!\", although the character of Hassall does not appear in the television version, which was much changed by Johnson from his original play.\n\n\n"}

Additions can include cream cheese, salsa, refried beans, sour cream, onion, rice, or jalapeños. There are many variations and alternative names used by region. Frito pie can be prepared in a casserole dish, but an alternate preparation can be in a single-serve Fritos-type corn chip bag with various ingredients as toppings. In Mexico, a similar type of dish is chilaquiles.\n\nThe exact origin of the frito pie is not completely clear. It is believed that it was created somewhere in Mexico and was popular at fiestas before it took off in other countries like the United States.\n\nThe oldest known recipe using Fritos brand corn chips with chili was published in Texas in 1949. The recipe may have been invented by Daisy Doolin, the founder's mother and the first person to use Fritos as an ingredient in cooking, or Mary Livingston, his executive secretary. The Frito-Lay company attributes the recipe to Nell Morris, who joined Frito-Lay in the 1950s and helped develop an official cookbook which included the Frito pie.\n\nDoolin and his Frito Corporation were early investors in Disneyland, which opened Casa de Fritos restaurant in Disneyland in 1955. \"Frito Chili Pie\" appears on the 1950s menu. \nAnother story claims that true Frito pie originated only in the 1960s with Teresa Hernández, who worked at the F. W. Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her Frito pie used homemade red chile con carne with cheddar cheese and onions, and was served in the bag – which was thicker in the 1960s.\n\nFrito pie is a simple dish: At its most basic, it is just a pile of Fritos with beef chili poured on top. It is often served right inside the chip bag, which is split down the middle; toppings typically include shredded cheese and chopped raw onion, and may also include additional items like sour cream and jalapeños.\n\nFrito Pies are sometimes referred to by the name walking taco or Frito boat, and can be made in a small, single-serving bag of corn chips, with chili, taco meat, garbanzos, pork rinds, pepitas, and many other varied ingredients, poured over the top. The combination can be finished with grated cheese, onions, jalapeños, lettuce, and sour cream, known as a Frito boat or walking taco in the Midwestern United States. In the Ohio Valley region, this preparation is commonly called taco-in-a-bag. (\"Walking taco\" or \"traveling taco\", however, is the more widespread term at least in the Midwest). In many parts of Southern California, they are known as \"pepper bellies.\" Frito pies are popular at sports venues, fundraisers, bingos, open houses, state fairs and street vendors. The term Tostiloco comes from Tijuana, and is found in California. Another term is Doriloco, after Doritos.\n\nIn Mexico, a version of the dish is known as tostilocos (\"crazy chips\"). It is topped with cueritos, cucumber, jícama, lime juice, Valentina hot sauce, chamoy, Tajín chili powder, salt, and \"Japanese peanuts\".\n\n\n"}

It inserts into root cementum one side and onto alveolar bone on the other.\n\nThe PDL consists of principal fibres, loose connective tissue, blast and clast cells, oxytalan fibres and Cell Rest of Malassez.\n\nThe main principal fiber group is the alveolodental ligament, which consists of five fiber subgroups: alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, apical, and interradicular on multirooted teeth. Principal fibers other than the alveolodental ligament are the transseptal fibers. \n\nAll these fibers help the tooth withstand the naturally substantial compressive forces which occur during chewing and remain embedded in the bone. The ends of the principal fibers that are within either cementum or alveolar bone proper are considered Sharpey fibers.\n\nTransseptal fibers (\"H\") extend interproximally over the alveolar bone crest and are embedded in the cementum of adjacent teeth; they form an interdental ligament. These fibers keep all the teeth aligned. These fibers may be considered as belonging to the gingival tissue because they do not have an osseous attachment.\n\nLoose coonective tissue contains fibres, extracellular matrix, cells, nerves and blood vessels. The extracellular compartment consists of Type 1, 3, and 5 collagen fibers bundles embedded in intercellular substance. The PDL collagen fibers are categorized according to their orientation and location along the tooth. The cells include fibroblast, defence cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.\n\nThese groups of epithelial cells become located in the mature PDL after the disintegration of Hertwig epithelial root sheath during the formation of the root.[2]They form a plexus which surrounds the tooth. Cell Rests of Malassez might proliferate during inflammation which may lead to lead to radicular cyst formation in later life.\n\nOxytalan fibres are unique to the PDL and are elastic in nature. It inserts into cementum and runs in 2 directions; parallel to root surface and oblique to root surface. The function is thought to maintain the patency of blood vessels during occlusal loading. Further research is needed to determine the function of oxytalan fibres.\n\nThe PDL substance has been estimated to be 70% water, which is thought to have a significant effect on the tooth's ability to withstand stress loads. The completeness and vitality of the PDL are essential for the functioning of the tooth.\n\nThe PDL ranges in width from 0.15 to 0.38mm with its thinnest part located in the middle third of the root.[5] The width progressively decreases with age.\n\nThe PDL is a part of the periodontium that provides for the attachment of the teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone by way of the cementum.\n\nThe PDL appears as the periodontal space of 0.4 to 1.5 mm on radiographs, a radiolucent area between the radiopaque lamina dura of the alveolar bone proper and the radiopaque cementum.\n\nPDL cells are one of the many cells derived from the dental follicle and this occurs after crown formation is completed and when the roots start developing. These cells will remodel the dental follicle to form the PDL. Formation of PDL will start at the cementoenamel junction and proceeds in an apical direction. .\n\nFunctions of PDL are supportive, sensory, nutritive, and remodelling.\n\nThe PDL is a part of the periodontium that provides for the attachment of the teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone by way of the cementum. PDL fibres also provide a role in load transfer between the teeth and alveolar bone. (PDL fibres absorb and transmit forces between teeth and alveolar bone. It acts as an effective support during the masticatory function.)\n\nPDL is heavily innervated; it involves mechanoreception, nociception and reflexes. Periodontal mechanoreceptors are present in pdl. They will transmit information about the stimulated tooth, direction and amplitude of forces.\n\nIt maintains the vitality of the surrounding cells. (PDL is heavily anastomosed). There are 3 principal sources of blood vessels which are apical vessels, perforating vessels and gingival vessels. Apical vessels originate from vessels that supply the pulp. Perforating vessels originates from lamina dura and the vessels perforate the socket wall (cribriform plate). Gingival vessels are derived from the gingival tissue. Outer layers of blood supply in PDL may help in mechanical suspension and support of the tooth while inner layers of blood vessels supply surrounding PDL tissues.\n\nThere are progenitor cells in the periodontal ligament that can differentiate into osteoblasts for the physiological maintenance of alveolar bone and, most likely, for its repair as well.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Karlsruhe.\n\nHis father was Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden, the heir to the Margraviate of Baden, which was raised to a grand duchy after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. His mother was Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was the brother-in-law of the rulers of Bavaria, Russia, and Sweden. His sister Caroline was the queen consort of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, his sister Louise was the empress consort of Alexander I of Russia and his sister Frederica was the queen consort of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden.\n\nAt the age of 15, Charles went on a journey to visit his sisters in their courts in St. Petersburg and Stockholm. He was on his way home with his father, when his father died in a fall from his coach on 15 December 1801. Charles was a witness to this accident.\n\nDue to the strong influence of France on the court of Baden, Charles was forced to marry Emperor Napoléon I's adopted daughter, Stéphanie de Beauharnais, in Paris on 8 April 1806, this despite his own protests and those of his mother and sisters. Charles apparently preferred the hand of his cousin Princess Augusta of Bavaria. It would be five years before the couple would produce an heir.\n\nCharles went to war in 1807 as head of the Baden contingent under Marshal Lefebvre. There he took part in the siege of Danzig.\n\nIn 1808, Charles returned to the side of his grandfather. His grandfather's age was beginning to show and Charles became co-regent. Charles was 25 years old when he succeeded his grandfather Charles Frederick upon the latter's death on 11 June 1811.\n\nOn 4 October 1817, as neither he nor the other sons from his grandfather's first marriage had surviving male descendants, Charles confirmed the succession rights of his half-uncles from the Hochberg morganatic line, granting each the title, Prince and Margrave of Baden, and the style of \"Highness\". He asked the princely congress in Aachen on 20 November 1818, just weeks before his death, to confirm the succession rights of the sons of Louise Caroline, Countess of Hochberg, morganatic second wife of Grand Duke Charles Frederick.\n\nBut this proclamation of Baden's succession evoked international challenges. The Congress of Vienna had, in 1815, recognised the eventual claims of Austria and Bavaria to parts of Baden which it allocated to Charles Frederick in the Upper Palatinate and the Breisgau, anticipating that upon his imminent demise those lands would cease to be part of the Grand Duchy. The disputes were resolved by the Treaty of Frankfurt, 1819, under which Baden ceded a portion of Wertheim, already enclaved within Bavaria, to that Kingdom, whereupon the succession as settled in 1817 was recognized by Bavaria and Austria.\n\n\nHereditary Prince Charles married Stéphanie de Beauharnais (28 August 1789 – 29 January 1860), daughter of Claude de Beauharnais and adoptive daughter of Emperor Napoléon I in Paris on 8 April 1806. Their children:\n\n\nAs Grand Duke Charles did not have any surviving male children, upon his death in Rastatt, he was succeeded by his uncle Louis I.

He was succeeded by his half brother, Leopold.\n\nHe secured the continued existence of the University of Freiburg in 1820, after which the University was called the Albert-Ludwig University. He also founded the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe in 1825. The Hochschule is the oldest technical school in Germany.\n\nLudwig's death in 1830 led to many rumors. His death also meant the extinction of his line of the Baden family. The succession then went to the children of the morganatic second marriage of Grand Duke Karl Friedrich and Louise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, who was created Countess of Hochberg in the Austrian nobility at the personal request of Karl Friedrich.\n\nAfter Ludwig's death, there was much discussion about a mysterious seventeen-year-old man named Kaspar Hauser, who had appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 1828.

Other prisoners at the same time included Gerry Adams and Patsy O'Hara, the third to die in the 1981 hunger strikes. He was released in 1978 for good behaviour. He briefly attended Queens University Belfast.\n\nIn 1981 he, his wife, Rita (née Margaret Higgins), and their infant daughter, Oorlagh, moved to New York City. George's wife and daughter later became United States citizens but he faced deportation proceedings. He was finally allowed to remain in the US following a lobbying campaign by Irish-American supporters, and was granted an \"O\" visa. He and his wife also have a United States-born son, Seamus.\n\nIn 1985, George made his debut as playwright of \"The Tunnel\", a stage drama based on a real-life 1976 prison escape attempt from Long Kesh. In 1986, he researched the non-fiction book \"The Pizza Connection\", with the late veteran American journalist Shana Alexander.\n\nIn 1993, he made his debut as screenwriter and assistant director with \"In the Name of the Father\", starring Daniel Day-Lewis, and directed and co-written by Jim Sheridan. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including best adapted screenplay for George and Sheridan. He wrote the screenplay for and directed the film \"Some Mother's Son\", starring Helen Mirren and Fionnula Flanagan, for which he was named Young European Director of the Year, in 1996. From 2000–04, he served as executive producer and co-creator of the CBS television series \"The District\", which starred Craig T. Nelson, David O'Hara and Lynne Thigpen. He and Billy Ray received screenplay credits for the World War II drama \"Hart's War\" in 2002. He earned his second Academy Award nomination in 2004 for directing, producing and co-writing \"Hotel Rwanda\", which starred Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo. The film received three Academy award nominations, including best original screenplay.\n\nAlong with screenwriter William Monahan and musician Van Morrison, George was honoured at the 2nd Annual Oscar Wilde Honoring Irish Writing in Film ceremony, held at the Ebell Wilshire in Los Angeles, California on 22 February 2007. Later that year, he directed \"Reservation Road\", starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jennifer Connelly, Mark Ruffalo and Mira Sorvino. In 2010 George wrote and directed the short film \"The Shore\". His daughter, Oorlagh produced the film, which was filmed over six days outside George's home in County Down, Northern Ireland. On 26 February 2012, \"The Shore\" won the Academy Award for best Live Action Short Film. In 2012, George wrote, directed and produced the feature film \"Whole Lotta Sole\". In 2016, George wrote and directed \"The Promise\", set during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and starring Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon, and Christian Bale.\n\nIn recognition of his \"exceptional services to film and drama\" George was awarded an honorary degree from Queen's University Belfast on 1 July 2013. In 2017 George received the Armin T. Wegner Humanitarian Award in honor of his films depicting genocides. In addition he received a khachkar, made by Hrach Gukasyan and commissioned by the Arpa International Film Festival and Awards Gala, with Armenian-style patterns in the shape of a Celtic cross, the latter in honor of his Irish heritage.\n\n"}

The members adopt the personae of 18th century aristocratic fops and sing songs from that perspective. They use titles of nobility, wear powdered wigs and period costumes, and maintain a snobbish attitude both during live performance and on their albums. The members say that their guiding philosophy is \"if not great and excellent, then debauched.\"\n\nTheir major music influence is Bon Scott-era AC/DC, along with glam rock band Kiss and fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap. \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"[d]ismiss Boston's Upper Crust as a joke rock band if you must, but give them this much: they're actually funny, and there's as much rock as mock to their singular brand of ‘roque’\", adding \"there's plenty of worthy riffs and double-entendre wit to go around\".

It is commonly performed as a Christmas song, although the lyrics make no reference to the December holiday.\n\nThe song arose from a personal experience of Berlin when his doctor suggested he try \"counting his blessings\" as a way to deal with insomnia brought on by stress. In a letter to 20th Century Fox executive Joseph Schenck, Berlin wrote:\"I’m enclosing a lyric of a song I finished here and which I am going to publish immediately…You have always said that I commercial my emotions and many times you were wrong, but this particular song is based on what really happened. ...\n\nThe story is in its verse, which I don't think I'll publish. As I say in the lyrics, sometime ago, after the worst kind of a sleepless night, my doctor came to see me and after a lot of self-pity, belly-aching and complaining about my insomnia, he looked at me and said \"speaking of doing something about your insomnia, did you ever try counting your blessings?\"\n\nBerlin then incorporated the song to the film \"White Christmas\" to advance the relationship between the characters played by Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney. The sentimental theme reminds listeners to remember how much they are blessed instead of fretting about short-term problems.\n\nIt was nominated for an Academy Award as \"Best Song\" but was defeated by \"Three Coins in the Fountain\" from the film of the same name written by Jule Styne and lyricist Sammy Cahn. It was performed on the 1955 Academy Awards telecast by vocalist Peggy King.\n\nThe best-known recordings were made by Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby—who both appeared in the film—as well as some separate recordings by Eddie Fisher, Sonny Rollins, Andy Williams, Tammy Wynette, Jimmy Durante, and the Ray Conniff Singers. The versions which reached the top of the \"Billboard\" charts were by Eddie Fisher (peaked at No. 5), Bing Crosby (No. 27) and Rosemary Clooney (No. 27).

It marked the end of this organization as a unitarian alliance of all socialist factions (anarchists and Marxists).\n\nThe background to the congress lay in the failure of the Paris Commune in June of the previous year, and in the different lessons drawn from it by the two most prominent members of the International, Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin. Marx, in his pamphlet \"The Civil War in France\", believed that the major lesson from the Commune was that it was essential for the proletariat to take control of the State and thus the International had to become a true political party of the proletariat. On the other hand, Bakunin saw the most important element of the Commune as being the Parisian workers' rejection of the State in all its forms and continued to call for a revolutionary alliance of workers and peasants in a decentralized organization.\n\nIn September 1871, the General Council of the International, headed by Marx, held a conference in London at which a series of resolutions were passed, including one (sometimes known as Resolution No.9) which stated: \"That this constitution of the working class into a political party is indispensable in order to ensure the triumph of the social revolution and its ultimate end — the abolition of classes.\" This was seen by many to imply a major change of direction to the content of the International's General Rules.\n\nThe resolution caused a great deal of consternation in many sections of the International, particularly in Italy, French-speaking Switzerland and Spain, as it was seen as a measure which would eliminate the autonomy of local sections and turn the General Council into a centralized political office. The Conference itself was considered irregular by these sections, who believed that decisions of this nature could only have been decided at a regular congress of the International.\n\nIn June 1872, a Congress was convened for 2 September 1872 in The Hague, the agenda for which was to concern a general revision of the organization's General Rules.\n\nThe Hague Congress met from 2 to 7 September 1872 in The Hague, Holland. Marx declared that the proletariat had to take control of the state for a successful revolution, and advocated that the Congress vote to uphold this view. The anarchists naturally objected. Anarchist leaders Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled for protesting after the Congress accepted Marx's proposal. Bakunin was not present at the conference but was expelled in absentia.\n\nAfter the expulsion of Bakunin and James Guillaume from the Hague Congress, the anarchists declared it null and void.\n\nThe anarchist faction (including the Jura federation, and the federations of Spain, Italy and Belgium) then held its own Congress of Saint-Imier, a few days later, from which also emerged the Anarchist St. Imier International.\n\nLater in that year of 1872 Bakunin wrote:\n\nThe legitimacy of this conference has been contested. Mr. Marx, a very able political conniver, doubtless anxious to prove to the world that though he lacked firearms and cannons the masses could still be governed by lies, by libels, and by intrigues, organized his Congress of the Hague in September 1872. Barely two months have passed since this congress and already in all of Europe (with the exception of Germany where the workers are brainwashed by the lies of their leaders and their press) and its free federations – Belgian, Dutch, English, American, French, Spanish, Italian – without forgetting our excellent Jura Federation [Switzerland] – there has arisen a cry of indignation and contempt against this cynical burlesque which dares to call itself a true Congress of the International. Thanks to a rigged, fictitious majority, composed almost exclusively of members of the General Council, cleverly used by Mr. Marx, all has been travestied, falsified, brutalized. Justice, good sense, honesty, and the honor of the International brazenly rejected, its very existence endangered – all this the better to establish the dictatorship of Mr. Marx. It is not only criminal – it is sheer madness. Yet Mr. Marx who thinks of himself as the father of the International (he was unquestionably one of its founders) cares not a whit, and permits all this to be done! This is what personal vanity, the lust for power, and above all, political ambition can lead to. For all these deplorable acts Marx is personally responsible. Marx, in spite of all his mis-deeds, has unconsciously rendered a great service to the International by demonstrating in the most dramatic and evident manner that if anything can kill the International, it is the introduction of politics into its program.\nAnd:\n\nIs it not astonishing that Mr. Marx has believed it possible to graft onto this precise declaration, which he himself probably wrote, his scientific socialism? For this – the organization and the rule of the new society by socialist savants – is the worst of all despotic governments!\n"}

The clan takes its name from Glen Garry where the river Garry runs eastwards through Loch Garry to join the Great Glen about 16 miles (25 km) north of Fort William, Highland.\n\nGlengarry is in Lochaber which was part of the ancient Kingdom of Moray that was ruled by the Picts. Ranald was the son of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, and Ranald himself had five sons. One of them was Alan, the progenitor of the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald and another was Donald. Donald married twice: firstly Laleve, daughter of the chief of Clan MacIver, by whom he had one son named John. Donald married secondly a daughter of the chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat by whom he had two more sons, Alexander and Angus. The first son, John, died without heirs and was therefore succeeded by his half-brother Alexander. Alexander is sometimes considered the first true chief of Glengarry but is usually regarded as the fourth.\n\nGlengarry did not play an important part in the politics of Clan Donald until the late fifteenth century. Traditional rights of the chiefs were being replaced with feudal relationships in which the Crown was the ultimate superior, as part of the royal policy to pacify the Scottish Highlands. Most of the chiefs submitted to James V of Scotland and even the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald accepted charters in 1494. However Alexander of Glengarry did not receive a charter, suggesting that he continued to have a rebellious attitude at this time. Finally in 1531 he submitted to royal authority and was pardoned for past offences. He received a Crown charter on 9 March 1539 for the lands of Glengarry, Morar, half the lands of Loch Alsh, Lochcarron, Loch Broom and also Strome Castle. This did not stop Alexander following Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat in trying to reclaim the Lordship of the Isles. Donald Gorm was killed attacking Eilean Donan Castle and the rebellion collapsed.\n\nSubsequently Alexander of Glengarry was amongst the island chiefs who were tricked into meeting James V at Portree and was imprisoned at Edinburgh where he remained until the king died in 1542. Glengarry himself died in 1590. His son was Angus who was politically astute and used the influence of his father-in-law, the chief of Clan Grant, to gain a charter from James VI of Scotland, regaining his ancestral estates in 1574.\n\nIn a bond of manrent, dated 1571, between Angus MacAlester of Glengarry and Clan Grant, Glengarry makes an exception in favour \"\"of ye auctoritie of our soverane and his Chief of Clanranald only \".\" This is held by Clanranald of Moydart as an acknowledgment by Glengarry of the Captain of Clanranald as his chief.\n\nThe Battle of Morar was fought in 1602 between the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry and Clan Mackenzie. Angus was succeeded by Donald, 8th chief, who is reputed to have lived for over one hundred years. Invited in 1626 by Lord Ochiltree, the Lord Chancellor of Scotland to discuss Royal policy for the Western Isles, he disagreed with the proposals and was imprisoned for a time. Despite this, in March 1627 he obtained a charter under the great seal that erected Glengarry into a free barony.\n\nWhen the 1638-1652 Wars of the Three Kingdoms began, Donald was too old for active campaigning and leadership passed to his son, Aeneas, later 9th chief. He served under James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose throughout his 1644-1645 campaign and protected him after the Battle of Philiphaugh. Aeneas forfeited his estates when Scotland was incorporated into the 1653 to 1659 Protectorate. They were returned after the 1660 Restoration and he received the title \"Lord Macdonell and Aros\".\n\nWhen James II & VII was expelled in the 1688 Revolution, the Glengarry MacDonells were among the 2% of Scots who remained Catholics. Ranald acted as head of the Catholic Jacobite faction and during the 1689 Rising, the Scots Parliament confiscated his lands, although he continued to hold Invergarry Castle. By late 1691, Invergarry was closely besieged and the Scottish government was determined to 'make an example' of the Macdonells. However, after agreeing to pardon Ranald, they switched targets to the Glencoe MacDonalds, which resulted in the Glencoe Massacre.\n\nGlengarry took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. When the captain of the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald was killed, Glengarry is said to have rallied his men by throwing up his bonnet and crying \"Revenge today and mourning tomorrow\"; in 1716, James Francis Edward Stuart made him Lord Macdonell in the Jacobite peerage. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 800 men.\n\nGlengarry's Regiment served throughout the 1745 Rising, initially led by Aeneas, Glengarry's second son; he was accidentally shot dead after Falkirk and replaced by his kinsman Lochgarry who commanded at the Battle of Culloden. His elder brother Alastair, later 13th Glengarry was captured by a British frigate in November 1745 when travelling from France to join the Rising. Imprisoned in the Tower of London, he was released in 1747 and at some point became a British government double agent. His reasons are still disputed but Scottish historian Andrew Lang confirmed his identity as 'Pickle the Spy' in 1897.\n\nThe Highland Clearances of the early 19th century forced the majority of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry into exile; most settled in Glengarry County, Ontario and parts of Nova Scotia. These were driven by the 15th chief, Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell, who was allegedly the model for haughty and flamboyant Highland chieftain Fergus MacIvor in Walter Scott's 1814 novel, Waverley. In June 1815, Glengarry formed the Society of True Highlanders, a rival to the Celtic Society of Edinburgh; he was closely involved in arguments over precedence before, during, and after George IV's visit to Scotland in 1822. The occasion is best remembered for popularising the idea of tartans and Highland dress. \n\nHis contemporary Alexander Macdonell (1762-1840) became a Catholic priest in Lochaber. In 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he served as chaplain in the Glengarry Fencibles, which was disbanded in 1804. Father Macdonell accompanied his clansmen to Glengarry County and helped reform the regiment for service in the War of 1812. In 1826, he was appointed first bishop of Kingston, Ontario.\n\n\nThe current and 23rd Glengarry is Aeneas Ranald Euan MacDonell.\n\n\n"}

The museum is dedicated to depicting the Holocaust through the personal stories of its victims.\n\nThe VHM first opened in 1997, founded by Mark Fetter, Devorah Ben David, Jay Ipson, and Al Rosenbaum. Housed in the former Education building at Temple Beth El, the museum became an attraction for school field trips. Within a few years, the museum outgrew the space at Temple Beth El, and required additional space to handle the growing number of visitors and school groups. The Virginia General Assembly offered the American Tobacco Company Warehouse for the relocation of the museum. After restoration and reconfiguration of the building, the expanded Virginia Holocaust Museum was dedicated on Yom HaShoah, the Holocaust Day of Remembrance, 2003.\n\nThe Virginia Holocaust Museum has grown steadily since 2003, and now has an average of over 42,000 visitors each year. The VHM remains an important location for Virginia field trips, with students from over 100 middle and high schools visiting yearly.\n\nThe museum began an extensive ongoing exhibition renovation project in 2015. Much of the permanent exhibition had never been updated since opening in 2003, and the renovations serve to both update the information contained with newly uncovered facts and figures, as well as update the core exhibition space to modern standards. The VHM hopes these renovations will be completed by 2020.\n\nFounded to educate the community about the tragedies of the Holocaust, the Virginia Holocaust Museum memorializes and documents the atrocities of World War II. Through exhibits, programming, and outreach, the Museum uses the history of genocide to teach the dangers of prejudice and indifference.\n\nLocated on the first floor of the museum, the core exhibits narrate the history of the Holocaust. As visitors progress through these exhibits—and chronologically through the events of the Holocaust—they are presented with a glimpse into the systematic destruction of European Jewry. 300 artifacts and the testimonies of local Holocaust survivors expand upon this history, representing the tangible and personal realities of this event.\n\nIn 2004, the VHM acquired an authentic \"goods wagon,\" or freight car, used during the Third Reich. Alexander Lebenstein, a local Holocaust survivor, worked with the museum to bring this important artifact to Richmond. Visitors have the opportunity to enter the artifact and imagine the conditions experienced by the people transported in this type of rail car.\n\nAt the center of the VHM's core exhibits is the story of a single family, the Ipsons. The \"Ipson Saga\" exhibition shares the experience of a family of local Holocaust survivors whose confinement in the Kovno Ghetto and harried escape to a farm in the Lithuanian countryside highlight the constant dangers Jews faced during the Holocaust.\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials were the first international trials of major Nazi war criminals. As such, they served as a major source of documents and testimony for early Holocaust scholarship. The \"Nuremberg Courtroom\" exhibit gives visitors the chance to see a full recreation of Room 600 at the Palace of Justice, used during the International Military Tribunals, and to experience the gravity of the trials. The Nuremberg Courtroom exhibit was opened to the public by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine during a ceremony in April 2008.\n\n"}

Old names for this river include \"Guallaga\" and \"Rio de los Motilones\". The Huallaga is born on the slopes of the Andes in central Peru and joins the Marañón before the latter reaches the Ucayali River to form the Amazon. Its main affluents are the Monzón, Mayo, Biabo, Abiseo and Tocache rivers. Coca is grown in most of those valleys, which are also exposed to periodic floods.\n\nAlthough it runs for 700 miles (1,100 km), it remains unnavigable for most part. For nearly its entire length the Huallaga is an impetuous torrent running through a succession of gorges. It has forty-two rapids (pongos) and it crosses the Andes, forming the Pongo de Aguirre gorge. From this point, from the Amazon, the Huallaga can be ascended by larger river boats (\"lanchas\") to the port city of Yurimaguas, Loreto.\n\nAlthough there are no defined boundaries, the river is commonly divided into two or three sections. From the town of Tocache in San Martin to the source of the river is generally referred to as the Upper Huallaga. Regions of the river are also referred to as central Huallaga (usually from Tocache or Juanjui to Chazuta), and the lower Huallaga (usually from Chazuta to Yurimaguas where the Huallaga meets the Marañon). These divisions are for general reference, and are independent of the \"highland\" and \"lowland\" jungle regions of the Amazon Rainforest.\n\nBetween the Huallaga and the Ucayali lies the famous \"Pampa del Sacramento,\" a level region of stoneless alluvial lands covered with thick, dark forests, first entered by Christian missionaries in 1726. It is about long, from north to south, and varies in width from 40 to 100 kilometers. Many streams, navigable for canoes, penetrate this region from the Ucayali and the Huallaga. In addition to peasants, it is still occupied by many indigenous communities, such as the Cocama-Cocamilla.\n\nThe river and the riversides suffer point source pollution, utilized as an interminable garbage dump. At least one chute for garbage trucks is installed.\n\nThe Huallaga River supports a myriad of wildlife and vegetation. The river is especially rich in amphibian life. A total of 18 species of frogs have been recorded from it, including the Prostherapis femoralis, Phyllodromus pulchellus and Dendrobates reticulatus.\n\nSince the 1980s, the primary coca growing and drug trafficking activities in Peru have been in the Upper Huallaga Valley. \n\nThe coca is flown to Colombia, where it is used to create cocaine, which is subsequently shipped to the United States.\n\nVladimiro Montesinos, ex-head of Peru's intelligence service, is reported to have received $50,000 for every plane laden with drugs allowed to leave the Huallaga Valley. \n\nEric Fleming who played trail boss Gil Favor in the long-running Western TV series \"Rawhide\" was killed in the Huallaga River. During the shooting of location shots for an MGM film titled \"High Jungle\" on the Huallaga River on September 28, 1966, Fleming fell from a capsized dug-out canoe after paddling it beyond the rapids. His body was lost in the turbulent water and was not recovered until three days later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915874", "title": "Kofyar people", "text": "Kofyar people\n\nThe Kofyar are a population in central Nigeria numbering around 50,000. After several anthropological studies, they provide good illustrations of how colonial authorities become unwittingly enmeshed in local politics; of sustainable subsistence agricultural production in crowded areas; of successful self-directed development of market-oriented agriculture; and of the use of \"traditional\" cultural resources to prosper in modern Nigeria.\n\nThe population known as the Kofyar actually comprises three different \"tribes\" as designated by British colonial officers: the Doemak (or Dimmuk), Merniang, and Kwalla. However the three groups have a common language, economic pattern, and origin myth, and had formed into a union called the Koffyer Federation in the 1940s; they have therefore been referred to as a single group by anthropologists.\n\nWhen first encountered by early British colonial authorities, they lived in the rugged hills in the southeastern corner of the Jos Plateau and in settlements around the plateau base. Their subjugation by the British was largely non-violent until 1930, when a young Assistant District Officer named Barlow was killed in the hill village of Latok by a rock thrown at his head. After this the residents of Latok and neighboring villages were forced out of the hills and made to live on the plains below for nine years. In an award-winning study, anthropologist Robert Netting explained how Barlow had been unknowingly used in a local political dispute.\n\nRobert Netting began anthropological research with the Kofyar in the early 1960s. In the Kofyar homeland population densities were high, approaching 500/km² in many areas. Netting's primary focus was on the Kofyar ecological adaptations, including the highly intensive agriculture being practiced and also the social institutions that were instrumental to sustainability. Much of the land was in annual cultivation, with animal herds providing dung compost for fertilizer, and steep hillsides were intricately terraced. Netting's \"Hill Farmers of Nigeria\", a classic book in the field of cultural ecology, showed how social institutions such as household form and land tenure had adjusted to the intensive cultivation system. Netting compared adaptations of Kofyar and their neighbors to demonstrate Ester Boserup's thesis that agricultural intensification relates to the growth of increasingly dense population and decreasing per capita land area. Kofyar families farmed most intensively close to their homesteads while using less intensive bush and forest fallow systems, which required less investment, on more distant fields. Netting also observed that the Kofyar demonstrated a reversion to less labor-intensive long-fallow systems when land became available on the plains south of their traditional region. He further developed these ideas and placed the Kofyar within a much broader comparative context in his \"Smallholders, Householders\".\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Kofyar began to settle in the fertile plains of the Benue Valley to the south of the Jos Plateau. Pioneering farms there used extensive slash-and-burn methods, but with rising population density and market stimulus, intensive methods were gradually introduced. By the 1980s, Benue Valley Kofyar were producing considerable surpluses of yams, rice, peanuts, pearl millet and sorghum using labor-intensive but generally sustainable methods – an interesting contrast to the externally supported agricultural development schemes in the region, which have generally failed.\n\nAs in the homeland, millet beer was found to play a key role not only in daily life but in the organization of agricultural production. The highly productive farming system ran almost entirely on human labor, with little external inputs, and a key strategy for mobilizing local labor was the \"mar muos\", a festive labor party at which all workers were served generous amounts of millet beer.\n\nAlthough most Kofyars now live in the Benue Valley (or in cities), the Jos Plateau homeland is still inhabited largely because of the Kofyars' efforts to maintain it as a cultural and economic resource. Many Kofyar who live elsewhere still keep secondary homes in the homeland.\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball from 1898 through 1918 for the Louisville Colonels, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds. \n\nLeach played in the first modern World Series in 1903 with the Pirates, hitting four triples to set a record that still stands. He played alongside legendary ballplayers such as Honus Wagner and Mordecai Brown. Leach began his career primarily as an infielder including playing shortstop, second base and, mostly, third base. Later, to take advantage of his speed, Leach played mostly outfield. Leach is also famous for being interviewed for Lawrence Ritter's \"The Glory of Their Times\" collection.\n\nLeach was well known for his small stature and was nicknamed \"Wee Tommy\". In 1902, while with the Pirates, he led the National League in home runs with a total of six. Each one was of the inside-the-park variety, which was not unusual in the \"dead-ball era\". 49 of Leach's 63 career home runs were inside-the-park, which is still a National League record.\n\nDuring Leach's years in Pittsburgh as a regular and playing with stars such as Honus Wagner, the Pirates won the National League pennant four times and were World Series champions once. Among the swiftest runners of his era, Leach had 361 stolen bases, 1,355 runs scored, and 172 triples.\n\nFollowing two years of infighting, and a subsequent peace pact signed by the presidents of the National and American leagues, Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the Pirates, saw an opportunity to bring fans back to the game and so proposed a \"World Series\" between the top teams in the two leagues, Boston and Pittsburgh.\n\nWith stars Wagner, Leach and player–manager Fred Clarke, Pittsburgh appeared the more formidable of the two. And indeed the Pirates jumped to a three to one series lead. Leach had the first World Series hit, a triple off Cy Young, and scored the first ever World Series run in game one with Wagner batting him in. Leach finished the game with two singles and two triples as the Pirates won, seven to three. In game four, Leach again starred, getting two hits, including a two-run triple and knocking in three runs, with the Pirates winning a close game five to four.\n\nPittsburgh, at this point, had a seemingly insurmountable three games to one lead, but would not win again, losing the series to Boston five games to three. Despite the loss, Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss could feel his vision of a World Series had been a success, since the public had come out in large numbers to watch the games with over 100,000 paying spectators, the games had been hard-fought, with the players on both teams giving it their all, and the Pirates had proven to be a mighty foe, with stars such as Leach proving their worth on the field. Leach led both teams in RBIs in the series with seven and finished second on the Pirates in batting average for the series. A commonly cited anecdote, one which Leach recanted to Lawrence Ritter, is the Boston Royal Rooters constant chanting of the popular song \"Tessie\" threw Honus Wagner off his game, though it is more likely that Wagner played hurt during the series.\n\nAfter his playing career was over, Leach managed in the minor leagues, was signed as an infield coach for the minor league Atlanta Crackers in 1929, and did some scouting for the Boston Braves. Leach was considered for a few managerial positions including manager of the New York Yankees as well as the Chicago entry of the Federal League. He eventually retired in Florida where he went into the citrus business. Leach was the oldest participant included in Lawrence Ritter's famous \"The Glory of Their Times\" collection, having been born in 1877 and being 86 when Ritter interviewed him. Leach, as part of his interview with Ritter for the book recounted an anecdote concerning Dummy Hoy. It seems the two roomed together in 1899, and Leach said of Hoy: \"We got to be good friends. He was a real fine ballplayer. When you played with him in the outfield, the thing was that you never called for a ball. You listened for him and if he made this little squeaky sound, that meant he was going to take it.\" Leach went on to say, \"We hardly ever had to use our fingers to talk, though most of the fellows did learn the sign language, so that when we got confused or something we could straighten it out with our hands.\" As a result of this and similar experiences, some historians credit Hoy with umpires using hand signals for balls and strikes and safe and out calls.\n\nIn the fall of 1960, Leach appeared on the television program \"I've Got A Secret\" alongside Boston American Freddy Parent, as a commemoration of participating in the first World Series in 1903.\n\n\n"}

Rycroft previously served as Permanent Secretary at the Department for International Development (DFID) from 2018 to 2020 and as the Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York from 2015 to 2018.\n\nRycroft was born in Southampton, before moving to Cambridge at the age of eleven. He studied mathematics and philosophy at Merton College, Oxford.\n\nRycroft joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) after graduation, in 1989. Following short spells in Geneva and on the NATO desk in Whitehall, Rycroft spent four years at the British embassy in Paris. In 1995-96, Rycroft was Head of Section in the Eastern Adriatic Unit at the FCO: a demanding role, given the aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars. Very soon after taking up this role, he served as a member of the British deputation to the Dayton peace talks. Between 1996 and 1998 he was a desk officer in the FCO Policy Planners.\n\nIn 1998, he joined the British embassy in the United States, where he served for four years. In 2002, Rycroft was appointed Private Secretary to Prime Minister Tony Blair, to advise him on matters related to foreign policy, the European Union, Northern Ireland and defence. During this time Rycroft wrote a letter to Mark Sedwill, private secretary to the foreign secretary, Jack Straw. The letter reveals that \"we and the US would take action\" without a new resolution by the UN security council if UN weapons inspectors showed Saddam had clearly breached an earlier resolution. In that case, he \"would not have a second chance\". That was the only way Britain could persuade the Bush administration to agree to a role for the UN and continuing work by UN weapons inspectors, the letter says. Dated 17 October 2002. \"This letter is sensitive,\" Rycroft underlined. \"It must be seen only by those with a real need to know its contents, and must not be copied further.\"\n\nIt was in this capacity that Rycroft issued the \"Downing Street memo\". During his time in Downing Street, in 2003, he was made a CBE.\n\nFrom March 2005 to July 2008, Rycroft served as Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina. In July 2008, he was appointed EU Director in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and then, in 2011, he became Chief Operating Officer. He became Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York in April 2015.\n\nRycroft's name became familiar to the general public as the author of a to the British Ambassador to the United States, David Manning, summarizing a 23 July 2002 meeting with Blair and other government officials \"to discuss Iraq\". The memo was leaked to \"The Sunday Times\", which printed it on 1 May 2005.\n\nThe memo includes discussion of a \"shift of attitude\" in the Bush administration which made it appear that at this point, while the public was still being told that Iraq could avoid an invasion by agreeing to abide by UN resolutions, \n\nMilitary action was now seen as inevitable.\n\nFurthermore, the memo went on to state, \n\nBush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.\n\nbolstering the assertions of opponents of Bush and Blair that the invasion had been decided \"a priori\", the intelligence to support the invasion had been slanted towards that purpose, and that there had been insufficient planning for the aftermath. This was even more explicitly stated elsewhere in the memo,\n\nThe Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.\n\nRycroft was appointed Permanent Secretary at the Department for International Development with effect from January 2018.\nRycroft replaced Mark Lowcock who ran the department from 2011. He was appointed Permanent Secretary of the Home Department in March 2020 following the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam.\n\n"}

It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species.\n\nIt is found from as far north as Maritime Canada to as far south as Louisiana in North America. Some also inhabit parts of Western Asia.\n\nCommon belief has it that \"T. domestica\", first only occurring in Europe, was accidentally introduced to the Americas by British lumber merchants during the Napoleonic Wars era along with wooden cargo exported over the Atlantic Ocean. Recent arachnological studies, however, suggest that the species had a common ancestor with the giant house spider that spread to both Europe (through Asia) and the rest of North America from Northwestern Canada (possibly from a region currently including British Columbia) long before the first human settlement in North America.\n\nDomestic house spiders possess elongated bodies with a somewhat flattened cephalothorax and straight abdomen. Their body/legs ratio is typically 50–60%, which accounts for a body size of in females and in males.\n\nMales are usually distinguished from females by having longer, more agile legs, bloated pedipalps and elongated abdomen. Other distinctions are strictly behavioral.\n\nThe coloring of an adult \"T. domestica\" is typically dark orange to brown or beige (maybe even grayish), with a common characteristic of striped legs and two dull, black, longitudinal stripes on the cephalothorax. The abdomen is mottled in brown, beige, and grey and has a pattern of chevrons running lengthwise across the top (similar to an argyle pattern).\n\nBarn funnel weavers are active and agile hunters, relying on both their vision and movement speed as well as web mechanisms. Their eye configuration, with six out of eight sighting forward, allows them to distinguish even the smallest movement in front of them and either follow it, or retreat if the movement is too large. These spiders are also known to be photosensitive, i.e. moving to or fleeing from the light, depending on situations.\n\nLike many agelenids, barn funnel weavers are very precise in their movements. Instead of following a continuous gait pattern, they usually move in short intervals, stopping several times before deciding where to head next. Males will wander aimlessly around the house if undisturbed, but will soon switch to the running interval if prey or threat are spotted. Their legs are perfectly fit for walking (with tarsi bent outward on the tips) and spiders can run over quite long distances in both situations.\n\nThis spider builds a funnel-shaped web to catch its prey. It usually consists of a multitude of stressed silk threads spun over a flat surface (such as a window sill) near any corner, with a funnel-like structure reaching for the corner, in which the spider would typically reside (hence the name). These webs can become quite large if undisturbed. They act like cord strings, helping the spider glide over them, and once a prey stumbles into the web, it will quickly get attacked, then dragged inside the funnel part and eaten, but very rarely stored underneath the structure.\n\nFemales that dwell indoors would usually live for over one or two years on the same web, with some residing for as long as seven years in rarely disturbed places (attics, basement or cellar parts, storage rooms, etc.). Outdoor females perish with cold weather and males rarely live for over a year. In late fall (autumn), an egg sac is made containing up to 50 eggs and put in the very tip of the funnel, protected by the female.\n\n\"T. domestica\" is not a particularly aggressive species and will often retreat when confronted. As long as its web is undisturbed, the spider will usually retreat to the funnel tip and stop responding to any movement whatsoever. If the web is attacked and partially destroyed, the spider will attempt to flee the area or may huddle its body into a ball against the wall or some other nearby object. To usher the spider into a container for removal, place open end in front of the spider and use the container lid if so equipped or similar object to push or corral the spider from behind. Since a spider's first reflex after being disturbed from the rear is to move forward, usually the spider will advance into the container placed in front of it.\n\nTegenaria species rarely bite. If they do, the bite is painless.\n"}

The tower was completed in 1982, but the surrounding plaza was never completed.\n\nThe Pemex Executive Tower remained the tallest building in Mexico for almost 20 years, until August 2003, when the 55-story Torre Mayor was completed only half a mile away. As of January 2018, the Torre Pemex is the sixth tallest building in Mexico, and the fourth tallest in Mexico City. The tower is currently occupied by approximately 7,000 Pemex employees.\n\nOn 19 September 1985, the tower withstood a magnitude 8.1 earthquake, as well as other strong earthquakes that commonly strike Mexico City. The building was designed to withstand an earthquake of 8.5 on the Richter scale.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, a powerful explosion rocked the tower, claiming 37 lives and injuring approximately 126. The explosion is believed to have occurred in the basement of the building's link to an adjacent building (which took the most damage). A gas leak and following accumulation ignited by sparks is believed to be the cause of the explosion. Employees said that the Torre Ejecutiva swayed and vibrated for a few seconds.\n"}

Later, he was the head of the Foundation of Former GROM Soldiers.\n\nSławomir Petelicki was born September 13, 1946 in Warsaw. In 1969 he graduated from the Law Faculty of the Warsaw University. The same year he joined the I Department(Intelligence) Ministry of Internal Affairs of People's Republic of Poland and, until 1990, he served at various posts in the intelligence. On various posts in Polish embassies abroad he was responsible for counter-intelligence. Since 1973 a military advisor at the Polish consulate in New York. Upon his return to Poland he continued his service in the economical intelligence. After a brief stay in Sweden between 1983 and 1987, where he served as the head of the Polish intelligence in the embassy in Stockholm, he returned to Poland where he was assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the commanding officer of all the security services guarding Polish embassies and consulates. \n\nApart from his intelligence service, Petelicki was also an active member of special forces. He gained extensive experience in reconnaissance and diversion. Very little is known of the missions he was part of, apart from the missions to North Vietnam in 1971 and to China the following year.\n\nIn 1990 Petelicki was assigned to a newly formed, then top secret JW 2305 special forces. Initially consisting only of himself, the unit was soon expanded to become GROM. For the first several years the unit remained completely secret. It was first reported to the press in 1992 and became known to the public in 1994, after their first major military operation in Haiti. Dismissed on December 19, 1995, Petelicki remained unassigned. \n\nBetween May 14 and June 13 of 1996, Petelicki was the deputy Prime Minister for fighting organized crime. On December 7, 1997 he was again assigned as the commanding officer of the GROM unit. On August 15, 1998, the \"Day of the Polish Army\", he was promoted by president Aleksander Kwaśniewski to the rank of brigadier general. On September 17, 1999 he finally gave up the command of GROM and retired. Thereafter, he headed the Foundation of Former GROM Soldiers, which helps veterans to meld into society.\n\nIn his later years he openly criticized the Polish Government and condemned Polish president Bronisław Komorowski. He was considered a hero by various right-wing groups because of similarities in their beliefs. He also accused Polish premier Donald Tusk of high treason.\n\nOn June 16, 2012, Petelicki's wife found his body lying next to his car parked in the garage of their apartment block in Warsaw. According to the police, Petelicki died from a self-inflicted gunshot to his head. Apart from the bullet entrance and exit wounds in his temples, no other injuries were found on his body, and security cameras did not record the presence of any other people in the garage at the time of his death, leading the police to conclude that Petelicki had committed suicide. He has left no suicide note.\n\nDuring his military career, Sławomir Petelicki was awarded with some of the most notable military medals, including the following:\n\n\nIn addition, Petelicki was an honorary member of the 5th and 10th Special Forces Groups of the American \"Green Berets\" and a bearer of the Golden GROM Badge with Wreath. During his career he accomplished parachute, sniper and diver training. He also gained the I dan in Judo and was a specialist in helicopter landing. Popular among the journalists and mass media, Petelicki was also awarded with the title of \"Gentleman of the Year 2000\" by the \"Gentleman\" monthly.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916006", "title": "Lost in Blue", "text": "Lost in Blue\n\nLost in Blue is a sandbox style video game for the Nintendo DS handheld system, and is a continuation of Konami's \"Survival Kids\" series. \"Lost in Blue\" follows two young teenagers, Keith and Skye, who struggle for survival on a deserted island. The player must learn to use the island's natural resources to create a makeshift home away from home. The sequel, \"Lost in Blue 2,\" was released two years later. A third installment of the series, \"Lost in Blue 3,\" was released on December 20, 2007 in Japan.\n\nDue to an undershipment, the game was difficult to find in the months following its North American release.\n\n\"Lost in Blue's\" gameplay makes extensive use of the system's touchscreen and microphone features. In the fire building sequence, the player must alternate pressing of the L and R buttons in order to build enough friction on the wood, and then blow into the DS's microphone to successfully ignite the fire. If the player later gets a fire maker with bow, he or she can press L or R and it will automatically fill up, allowing the player to blow into the microphone and finishing the fire. The touch screen interface is used for navigating menus, and the island can be explored and interacted with using either the touch screen or the standard control buttons.\n\nThe game's primary action takes place on the touch screen, while the top screen is used to display Keith and Skye's health, which is categorized by hunger, thirst, stamina, and hit points. If the thirst or energy categories hit zero, the character's hit points will begin to drop. It is also possible for other conditions, such as passing out due to lack of stamina, to occur. The player loses if either Keith or Skye runs out of hit points and dies. Players must multitask in micromanaging both characters' vital statistics while also exploring the island.\n\nThe game's primary protagonist is Keith, who must lead Skye around the island by hand due to her poor eyesight. Upon completing the game, a \"Skye Mode\" is unlocked which allows the player to play the entire game from Skye's perspective. In this mode, she can freely move about the island without assistance, although she is unable to climb as Keith can, severely limiting her range of travel.\n\n\"Lost in Blue\" is not a linear game in its gameplay and its multiple endings provide a different story nearly every time one plays through it. The story advances through exploration of the island, which consists almost entirely of moving deeper inland into the island and uncovering its secrets. Some days may not be spent exploring and advancing the story but rather by just trying to survive by collecting food, building furniture, and so on.\n\nThe story begins with the protagonists riding on ship when a massive storm causes the vessel to sink. In the commotion, Skye manages to get on a liferaft while Keith plunges into the water, at which point he loses consciousness.\n\nKeith wakes up on the beach of the south side of a deserted island. After exploring his surroundings, he finds shelter in a cave. The next day, Keith crosses a nearby river and finds Skye asleep next to her raft, which is apparently undamaged. After she wakes up, Keith and Skye meet for the first time and she tells him that she can't see very well because she has lost her glasses. Keith offers to help her look for her glasses, but accidentally steps on them during the search. With Skye's vision severely impaired, she becomes dependent on Keith to guide her safely around the island.\n\nThe two return to the cave and make a home. In the following days, Keith enters a routine of leaving the cave to explore the island and gather food and supplies, and Skye helps by preparing meals. Keith also brings Skye along with him on occasion when he finds an area of the island that he can't traverse by himself.\n\nDuring his explorations, Keith comes across some ancient ruins on the island that are clearly man-made and filled with various puzzles. Eventually making his way to the other end of the temple, he discovers that there are in fact other people on the island, but his joy turns to caution when he overhears a conversation between the two men discussing their orders to kill intruders. Keith decides to stealthily slip past them to try to use them to escape the island. Sneaking into the bandits' hideout, Keith discovers a ship and, after uncovering what information he can, returns to Skye.\n\nWhen Keith returns to the bandits' hideout, he discovers that the guards have shaped up and are more vigilant. He also discovers a uniform that he can use as a disguise to sneak into the hideout. When the teens finally escape together, they end up in civilization again. The ending varies depending on Keith's relationship with Skye.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n"}

It was arranged by Ron Goodwin and produced by George Martin. Although never a hit single, it was played countless times on BBC national radio in the UK in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly on \"Children's Favourites\".\n\nThe chorus of the song is as follows:\n\nChildren's author Jacqueline Wilson chose the song as one of her \"Desert Island Discs\" in October 2005.\n\n\nThe rhythm and tempo of this song is often used to teach people the rhythm of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The recommended rate for CPR is 100 chest compressions per minute. A study at Coventry University compared the effectiveness of this song in maintaining this rhythm with an alternative of \"That's the Way (I Like It)\" and no song at all. The version used for the study was from a Little Acorns brand children's record, and was found to have a tempo of 105 beats per minute. Singing the chorus of the song twice, with a compression on each beat, results in exactly 30 compressions, which is the international standard for CPR.\n\nThe use of \"Nellie\" resulted in correct timing for 42 out of 130 cases, as compared with 15 for no music and just 12 for \"That's the Way (I Like It)\". However the depth of compression was found to be inadequate in most of those cases, and the use of \"Nellie\" was found to increase this inadequacy slightly, as compared with the use of no music (56% too shallow with \"Nellie\" and 47% without).\n\nMore recently the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\" has been promoted as an alternative.\n"}
{"id": "1916053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916053", "title": "Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch", "text": "Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch\n\nThe Light Tank Mk VII (A17), also known as the Tetrarch, was a British light tank produced by Vickers-Armstrongs in the late 1930s and deployed during the Second World War. The Tetrarch was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army. It improved upon its predecessor, the Mk VIC Light Tank, by introducing the extra firepower of a 2-pounder gun. The War Office ordered 70 tanks, an order that eventually increased to 220. Production was delayed by several factors and, as a consequence, only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced.\n\nThe tank's design flaws, combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions, ruled out the use of Tetrarchs in the North African Campaign. As a result, the majority of the tanks remained in Britain, although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the Lend-Lease program. In early 1941, the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations, one of which was equipped with Tetrarchs. In May 1942, a small number of Tetrarchs formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar, and, in June 1942, Tetrarchs were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air-portable light tank to support British airborne forces. The Tetrarchs were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment.\n\nThe division used approximately 20 Tetrarchs during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. The tanks were successfully landed by glider, but they did not perform well. Several were lost in accidents, and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces. A few days after the beginning of the operation, the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support. By August 1944, most of the Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks, and the remainder were replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944.\n\nTetrarchs did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946; the last was retired in 1950. There were several variations on the Tetrarch design, including the Alecto self-propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII, but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army.\n\nThe prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII (A17), nicknamed 'Purdah', was first developed in 1937 by Vickers-Armstrongs as a private venture, and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries. It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company. The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns. Vickers-Armstrong installed on the Mk VIIs a 2-pounder main gun paired with a Besa machine gun, and mounted the two guns in a two-man turret. The tank possessed a maximum of of armour. The prototype weighed approximately and was powered by a Meadows engine. Suspension was on eight road wheels, four per side, with no separate driver or idler wheels and it was capable of a top speed. The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models. The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks. For sharper turns, the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage. The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping, and each of the wheels was independently sprung.\n\nThe War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938; the model was tested as a possible \"light cruiser\" since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor, the Mark VI. The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance. Despite this, it was decided that it was essential for some Tetrarchs to be produced, and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program. Accordingly, the War Office gave the Tetrarch the official General Staff specification number A17, and, in November 1938, accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank's range.\n\nThe number to be produced was subject to fluctuation as the War Office vacillated in their demand; in July 1938, it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced, then increased the request to 120 after a three-day conference in November. Production was to begin in July 1940, but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100. The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon, a company part owned by Vickers-Armstrong that would be producing the tanks, indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks.\n\nProduction of the tank was delayed by a number of factors. The War Office put their order on hold in a post-Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks, due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle. Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks, light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour, were nevertheless deployed against them; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re-evaluate the suitability of the light tank design. The pre-war role of the light tank, that of reconnaissance, meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross-country abilities. Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the \"Luftwaffe\" during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk VIIs; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177. The name 'Tetrarch' was given to the Mk VII, on 22 September 1941, on the orders of the War Office. The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year.\n\nThe War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat, and the Tetrarch was considered to be obsolete. This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat.\n\nThe demise of Tetrarch was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid-1941, as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain's fledgling airborne forces, formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces, officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment, which, by 1941, was to include artillery and some form of tank. Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions, but, by May 1941, the feasibility of a tank to be carried for in a glider was accepted, although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task. In a conference held on 16 January 1941, it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar, currently under development, would be used to transport a single Tetrarch tank or two Universal Carriers. The Tetrarch was chosen because it was an obsolete design, and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces.\n\nBeginning in January 1944, training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar gliders. These exercises were successful; during the training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, which specialised in flying the Hamilcars, over 2,800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training. When the Tetrarch was re-designated as an airborne tank, several changes were made to its design. A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a infantry support howitzer; these tanks were then designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support). Additionally, Littlejohn adaptors were added to those Tetrarchs which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration.\n\nThe Tetrarch experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces. One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942, which particularly affected the airborne forces. The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the Lend-Lease Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces, as did the loss of several more during Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Madagascar. A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 Tetrarchs were available for use. In a memorandum, dated January 1943, by Major General George F. Hopkinson, commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Hopkinson complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available, whereas only 50 actually remained, with no reserves to replace those lost in combat. This lack of sufficient replacement reserves, combined with a War Office report that some 287 airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India, led to the Tetrarch's eventual replacement by the US M22 Locust.\n\nA number of design faults of the Tetrarch were revealed through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.\n\nProblems were also found with the Littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2-pounder to increase its range and penetration power; after they had been fitted the adapters could not be removed, and could only fire specially designed armour-piercing rounds, which took time to manufacture.\n\nThe War Office also considered the Tetrarch's cooling system faulty, making the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe first Tetrarchs were delivered to the Army in November 1940, and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division (which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division. However, the faults discovered with the Tetrarch cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign. Shortly after, all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service.\n\nThe Tetrarchs remained in Britain, and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service, but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR, Operation Barbarossa began, and the USSR became an ally of Britain. The Lend-Lease program, begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China, was therefore extended to the USSR. As part of the program, the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR, which in early 1942, included a shipment of 20 Tetrarchs, as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks. The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions; additionally, the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks. Additional testing of the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its controllability, manoeuvrability, and speed, as well its ability to run on low-quality fuel, unlike contemporary Soviet designs. The thinness of the Tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved, as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed. Despite these drawbacks in the Tetrarch's design, Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T-70 light tank in use at the time, and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat. A number of Tetrarchs were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle, and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd Separated Tank Battalion, which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade; both tanks were destroyed in combat, one on 30 September and the other on 2 October, the latter a casualty of artillery fire. Several were also used for propaganda purposes, appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the Caucasus region.\n\nIn mid-1941, the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations, known as 'A', 'B' and 'C' Special Service Squadrons. Both 'A' and 'B' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark VIc light tanks, but 'C' Squadron was equipped with twelve Tetrarchs transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade, 1st Armoured Division. On 31 July 1941, 'C' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside 'A' and 'B' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate. All three squadrons were transported to Inverary in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and disembarkation from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations. In early September, elements of 'C' Squadron, including six Tetrarchs, formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany, and the force was readied to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred. These fears proved groundless, and in March 1942, the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training.\n\nThe next assignment, Operation Ironclad, was the invasion of Madagascar, the third largest island in the world and then under Vichy French control. The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of Antsirane to Japanese naval forces, which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean. Operation Ironclad was under the command of Major General Robert G. Sturges and consisted of No. 5 Commando, 29th Independent Brigade Group, and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th Infantry Division. The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations, and under its command was 'B' Special Service Squadron, created by amalgamating six Valentines from 'B' Squadron and six Tetrarchs from 'C' Squadron into a single unit. The squadron was formed into four troops, one Headquarters troop of three Valentines and one Tetrarch, one of four Valentines, and two formed from the remaining five Tetrarchs. The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May, near Antsirane and the bay of Diego Suarez. The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip, which would allow the British forces to advance approximately and approach Antsirane from the rear. Information about the landing beaches, the defences possessed by the port, and the Vichy French defending forces was limited and vague, although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank.\n\nThe landings began at 04:30 on 5 May, with 5 Commando landing at Courrier Bay and the three infantry brigades and 'B' Squadron landing at Ambararata Bay. The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of Antsirane and a nearby town, but although the infantry landed successfully, 'B' Squadron had more trouble; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a Tetrarch came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand. The infantry brigades advanced toward Antsirane without the squadron, but eventually two Valentines and a single Tetrarch were dispatched in support, catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of Anamakia. Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences, consisting of camouflaged trenches and pillboxes dug in along a ridge. The tanks attempted to breach them, but the rocky ground made manoeuvring difficult and they could not close with the pillboxes and trenches; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine-gun fire, but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day. The tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island, and they were soon joined by two other Tetrarchs dispatched from the beaches; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the Vichy French main line of defence. This had been built prior to the First World War and included camouflaged pillboxes, machine-gun nests and dug-in 75 mm artillery pieces; the latter, although not specifically designed for an anti-tank role, could penetrate the armour of both the Tetrarchs and the Valentines. The two Valentines advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire, and two Tetrarchs that were moving behind them suffered the same fate; the third Tetrarch retreated in order to report on the French resistance, machine gunning a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back.\n\nThe commander of the Tetrarch made his report, and was then ordered to take command of four Valentines and two Tetrarchs which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences. The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out-flank the line by advancing from the right-hand side, using several hills as cover; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault, however, and one Valentine and one Tetrarch were hit and destroyed. The remaining tanks exchanged several volleys of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions. The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade, aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines; the remaining tanks of 'B' Squadron, two Valentines and three Tetrarchs, remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May, coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine. The squadron played no further part in the battle, as the Vichy French authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day, although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November. 'C' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion; only one Valentine and three Tetrarchs out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May, and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded. It remained in Madagascar until early 1943, when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade.\n\nBecause of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid-1940, when the British airborne establishment was formed, the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops. Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, was conducted by a retrained Commando unit. By 1942, there existed specifically trained airborne units, including the 1st Airborne Division, and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division. This unit, designated the Light Tank Squadron, was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division, using their tanks' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units. The obvious unit for conversion was 'C' Special Services Squadron, as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and, more importantly, was the only unit that was still using Tetrarchs; it had been re-designated as an airborne tank by the War Office. 'C' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942, bringing with it seven Tetrarchs among its other vehicles. The unit immediately began training, but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long; during mid-1943, the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily. 'C' Squadron remained in Britain, as not enough Hamilcar gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its Tetrarchs; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been raised in April 1943, and 'C' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict. The squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit, and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter-attacking enemy infantry and armour.\n\nOn 13 December 1943, the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars, and on 1 April 1944, it was re-designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment. The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron, a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron; two Tetrarchs, the Mark 1 CS variation, were attached to the Headquarters Squadron, but the Light Tank Squadron, also known as 'A' Squadron, received the majority of the Tetrarchs. 'A' Squadron had approximately nineteen Tetrarchs split between six troops, two of which were of the CS variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with Littlejohn adaptors. On 24 May 1944, after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres, 'A' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at Tarrant Rushton airfield, while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton airfield the next day; from these two airfields, the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy. The operation began on the night of 5 June, with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy. It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings, securing strategically important areas east of Caen, capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River Dives, and destroying a coastal artillery battery. Insufficient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division's brigades simultaneously; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day. Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th Airlanding Brigade, to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached, to be landed first; however, aerial photography revealed that anti-glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade. Therefore, Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade (which did not utilise gliders) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones, allowing the 6th Airlanding Brigade to land in the second lift.\n\nThe Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.\n\nThe squadron retrieved all of the remaining Tetrarchs and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment; there, they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the Bois de Bavent area and conduct reconnaissance duties. After linking with the battalion, the squadron began reconnoitring, and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered. By the end of 7 June, two Tetrarchs had been lost to enemy action, one destroyed by a German self-propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine. The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy, while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties. At this time, Gale decided to avoid, when possible, engaging the Tetrarchs with German armour, as they proved to be completely outclassed by the German tanks and self-propelled guns, such as the Panzer IV and the Sturmgeschütz III. Instead, when the division required armoured support, it summoned it from armoured units outside the division, and the Tetrarchs were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support. By August, in the division's preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, the majority of Tetrarchs in 'A' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks; only three Tetrarchs remained, assigned to the Headquarters troop of 'A' Squadron.\n\nOperation Tonga was the last that Tetrarchs saw of active combat. During the first week of October 1944, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization, in which it was completely restructured, and all the remaining Tetrarchs were retired. They were replaced with the M22 Locust, a purpose-built airborne light tank of American design; eight Locusts were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation Varsity, the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine. A report issued by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Tetrarch design was considered obsolete, and any light tanks used in post-war airborne formations would be entirely new in design. A small number of Tetrarchs remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949; a Hamilcar glider flight was stationed at RAF Fairford, and a troop of Tetrarchs was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders. However, glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the Tetrarchs withdrawn from service.\n\nThere were several variants of the Tetrarch design. The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII, Vickers-Armstrong's proposed successor to the Tetrarch. The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins, named after President Roosevelt's chief diplomatic advisor, and was given the General Staff design number A25 by the War Office. The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the Tetrarch in a number of areas. It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch, with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of and the side armour to , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help deflect shells fired at the tank. The dimensions of the Tetrarch were also changed; the Mark VIII was longer by , wider by and heavier. The new tank was no longer air-portable, as it was too heavy to be carried by a Hamilcar. The 12-cylinder engine of the Tetrarch was fitted to the Mark VIII, although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to ; its armament also remained the same as that of the Tetrarch. The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941. The new design was considered a success, and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1,000 to be constructed in September. However, problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes, and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems. These problems continued to persist into 1943, when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service; approximately 100 Mark VIIIs were produced by 1945, when production ended.\n\nA second variant on the Tetrarch design was the Tetrarch Duplex Drive (\"Tetrarch DD\"). The Duplex Drive system was invented by Nicholas Straussler, and was designed to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.\n\nSurviving Tetrarch are on display at Bovington and Kubinka.\n\n"}

Though she did not sing on the studio recordings of their songs, she did perform live and subsequently established an independent career as a singer.\n\nBrought up in Birmingham, England, Williams began working as a model, eventually gaining the title Miss Black Beautiful in a contest in 1973. After this initial success she went on to front her own band, Black Beautiful People. She later moved to West Germany with her friend Sheyla Bonnick. One day in 1975, while at a restaurant, the two were approached by an agent who asked if they were interested in joining a new pop group Boney M. \"She asked if we could sing. Well, you don't say no, do you,\" Williams later recalled in an interview. She had previously been singing with a local band back in England but had been told off by her brother Billy: \"You have a terrible voice. Better keep working as a walking clothes-hanger.\"\n\nIt turned out that it was not important if Williams could sing or not, since the job was to dance and mime to a disco song called \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\" that producer Frank Farian had recorded all the vocals for himself but was unable to promote himself since he had a career as a schlager singer in his own name. So Williams and Bonnick teamed up with a girl called Nathalie and a boy called Mike and did a discothèque tour and a few TV performances over the next months. Nathalie left and was replaced by Claudja Barry. Sheyla then decided that lip-syncing was not for her and left, hoping to achieve a solo career. Mike left as well, and the two were replaced by new members Marcia Barrett and Bobby Farrell. When Claudja went the same way as Sheyla, Liz Mitchell took her place, and finally the pieces fell together: Boney M. were assembled as a real group and ready to do a follow-up to \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\".\n\nBoth Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett were singers and would participate in the group's recordings together with producer Frank Farian who did the deep male voice. The threesome recorded the follow-up single \"Daddy Cool\" which soon became a worldwide hit and launched the group's phenomenal career, with numerous hit singles and albums over the next decade. Williams and Bobby Farrell did not sing on the records since \"their voices weren't suited for this particular kind of music\" as Farian put it in a Bravo interview in 1978. It did not create a scandal – both Williams and Farrell did sing during the group's many live performances during their extensive world tours 1977–1979. Williams remained with the group until the ultimate break-up in 1990. In 1994, she did what her former colleagues Liz Mitchell and Bobby Farrell had also done, she formed her own Boney M group, billed as Boney M featuring Maizie Williams. The group also featured Sheyla Bonnick from the short-lived original 1975 line-up. Williams herself would finally front as a lead singer in the group's renditions of the hits \"Brown Girl in the Ring\", \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday\", \"Sunny\" and \"Daddy Cool\".\n\nIt is stated on Williams' official site that \"it's no secret that although she sang in the studio Williams' less dominant voice appears to have been mostly excluded from many of the recordings, with the exception of some backing vocals, for reasons only the producer knew at the time\". However, the inner sleeve of the group's \"Oceans of Fantasy\" LP, 1979, lists only Farian, Mitchell and Barrett in the track-by-track vocal credits. Maizie did record a minor part for the group's \"That's Boonoonoonoos / Train to Skaville\" which was also broadcast in the 1981 TV special \"Ein Sound geht um die Welt\" (A Sound Goes Around the World), but in the final mix released on record, the part was eventually re-recorded by Liz Mitchell.\n\nThe singer initiated a court case against Boney M.'s producer Frank Farian and Sony/BMG concerning her rights to perform under the name \"Boney M\". Farian was promoting Liz Mitchell's group as the authentic continuation of Boney M. The court heard that \"she had not sung on any of the band's recordings\". On 16 February 2009, Williams had judgement in the case, that Farian has to account to her for pay on all record sales and future sales.\n\nBesides still touring the world, Williams released her first solo record in December 2006, \"Call Upon Jesus\", including the download single \"Praise Be Unto Him\". In February 2007, she released her own dance version of the Boney M. hit \"Sunny\". In June, she starred as the featured vocalist on Latvian group Melo-M's version of \"Daddy Cool\" which hit the No. 1 spot in the LMK charts in the last week of August.\n\nIn September 2011, a Dutch press release was issued regarding a tribute single that has been written by Williams, together with Dutch songwriters Eddie Middle-Line and Björn de Water. The song and video for \"Josephine Baker\" (Eddie Middle-Line Mix) had a worldwide release.\n\n"}

In France and the Netherlands he is also still known as \"Corneille de La Haye\" () after his birthplace, The Hague.\n\nAlthough he is well documented as the leading painter in this distinctively French style, because he never signed or dated his paintings very few identifiable works can be firmly traced as his, with the first one identified in 1962. Distinguishing his hand from the many other artists working in the same style is therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible; works tend to be attributed to him on grounds of quality alone. \n\nCorneille's portraits are nearly miniature in scale, ranging from the size of a postcard to about 8\" x 10\". Corneille worked in oil paint on wood panels. The flesh areas are painted very thinly, while the greenish backgrounds are painted more thickly. Similarities with the work of Hans Holbein may point to the use of tracing frames by both painters. The Louvre in Paris and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art are both good places to study Corneille's work. The Metropolitan has a portrait in the Robert Lehman collection, and another in the Jack and Belle Linsky collection, as well as six other works, some of which are not always on view. Boston's Museum of Fine Arts has two works by Corneille and the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields has three works.

The name refers to the color of bruising. The so-called black eye is the result of bleeding beneath the skin (hematoma) around the eye socket. If a more extensive injury, potentially even a skull fracture, an apparent black eye can sometimes worsen and may require professional medical treatment before it will resolve. This is more likely if the area around both eyes has been injured (raccoon eyes) or if there is a history of prior head injury or fracture around the eye. Though disfiguring, the vast majority of black eyes are not serious, require little or no treatment, and will resolve spontaneously within a week or two.\n\nBleeding \"within\" the eye, a condition called a hyphema, is more serious: it can permanently reduce vision and can result in damage the cornea. In some cases, abnormally high pressure inside the eyeball (ocular hypertension) can also result.\n\nDespite the name, the eye itself is not affected. Blunt force or trauma to the eye socket results in burst capillaries and subsequent haemorrhaging (hematoma). The fatty tissue along with the lack of muscle around the eye socket allows a potential space for blood accumulation. As this blood decomposes and is resorbed, various pigments are released lending itself to the extreme outward appearance.\n\nThe appearance (discoloration in purple and blue along with swelling) does not usually indicate a serious injury, and most black eyes resolve within a week. The tissues around the eye are soft and thus bruise easily when compressed against margins of bone which surround and protect the eye socket. The treatment is the same as that for bruises in other parts of the body – cold compresses during the first twenty-four hours. During the process of healing, and so long as there no breaks in the skin, a black eye can be made less conspicuous by using cosmetics designed to obscure discolorations of the skin. In a severe contusion, blowout of the floor of the orbit may occur, leading to double vision. Such an injury requires surgical correction.\n\nUnless there is actual trauma to the eye itself (see below), extensive medical attention is generally not needed.\n\nApplying an ice pack will keep down swelling and reduce internal bleeding by constricting the capillaries. Analgesic drugs (painkillers) can be administered to relieve pain.\n\nAn anecdotal remedy for a black eye consists of applying raw meat to the eye area. Research has yet to find any evidence of this treatment being effective. Likely the raw meat was used when ice packs were not yet commercially available and meat was stored in iceboxes instead of in a protective gas, while cold but not but freezing meat is more gentle to the skin than ice, and will not damage the surface of the skin as the skin temperature cannot go below freezing even in extreme cases. Meat is also soft and comes easier into contact with the skin than blocks of ice that were available.\n\nEye injury and head trauma may also coincide with a black eye. Some common signs of a more serious injury may include:\n"}

{"id": "1916131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916131", "title": "Blackburn Olympic F.C.", "text": "Blackburn Olympic F.C.\n\nBlackburn Olympic Football Club was an English football club based in Blackburn, Lancashire in the late 19th century. Although the club was only in existence for just over a decade, it is significant in the history of football in England as the first club from the north of the country and the first from a working-class background to win the country's leading competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup). The cup had previously been won only by teams of wealthy amateurs from the Home counties, and Olympic's victory marked a turning point in the sport's transition from a pastime for upper-class gentlemen to a professional sport.\n\nThe club was formed in 1878 and initially took part only in minor local competitions. In 1880, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, and three years later defeated Old Etonians at Kennington Oval to win the trophy. Olympic, however, proved unable to compete with wealthier and better-supported clubs in the new professional era, and folded in 1889.\n\nMost of Olympic's home matches took place at the Hole-i'-th'-Wall stadium, named after an adjacent public house. From 1880 onwards, the club's first-choice colours consisted of light blue shirts and white shorts. One Olympic player, James Ward, was selected for the England team and six other former or future England internationals played for the club, including Jack Hunter, who was the club's coach at the time of Olympic's FA Cup win.\n\nAssociation football was first codified in the 1860s in the south of England and played by teams of upper-class former public school pupils and Oxbridge graduates. However, the game spread to the industrial towns of the north by the following decade. The town of Blackburn in Lancashire had more than a dozen active football clubs by 1877, with Blackburn Rovers, founded in 1875, generally viewed as the leading team. Blackburn Olympic F.C. was founded in February 1878 when two of these clubs, Black Star and James Street, opted to merge. The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. The new club's first match was a friendly played on 9 February 1878 which resulted in a 2–0 win over local team St. John's. \n\nIn April 1878, the club entered its first competition, the Livesey United Cup. Olympic beat St. Mark's in the final to win the tournament, and, as the competition was not held again, the club retained the trophy in perpetuity. Over the next two seasons the club continued to play friendly matches and also entered the Blackburn Association Challenge Cup, a knock-out tournament open to all local clubs set up by the organisation which governed football within the town. Olympic won the cup in both 1879 and 1880, after which the competition was discontinued when the Blackburn Association was absorbed into the larger Lancashire County Football Association. As with the Livesey United Cup, the trophy remained in Olympic's possession for the remainder of the club's existence.\n\nIn 1880 the club's committee decided that Olympic should compete for greater prizes, and opted to enter two further competitions, the Lancashire Senior Cup and the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), the country's premier football competition. In the club's first FA Cup match, the \"Light Blues\" were defeated 5–4 by Sheffield, and the following season the team again lost in the first round, away to Darwen. The club's reputation within its home area was growing, however, and matches were now being arranged with teams from further afield, such as Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, and even Scottish clubs such as Cowlairs and Hibernian. The club's increasing expenses were met with the help of Sydney Yates, a local iron foundry owner, who invested a large amount of money and continued to bankroll the club for most of its existence. At the end of the 1881–82 season, Olympic defeated Blackburn Rovers to win the East Lancashire Charity Cup.\n\nIn the 1882–83 FA Cup, Olympic defeated four other Lancashire clubs, Accrington, Lower Darwen, Darwen Ramblers, and Church, to reach the fifth round. At this stage the \"Light Blues\" were drawn to play Welsh team Druids. Olympic defeated the Ruabon-based team 4–1 to progress to the semi-final stage, where for the first time they faced opponents from the south of England — Old Carthusians. The Carthusians, the team for former pupils of Charterhouse School, had won the cup two years earlier and even the local newspapers in Blackburn considered them strong favourites to reach the final again. Olympic, however, won 4–0 in a match played at a neutral venue in Whalley Range, Manchester, to set up a match with another of the great amateur teams, Old Etonians, in the final at Kennington Oval. The Etonians had defeated Olympic's close rivals Blackburn Rovers in the final a year earlier, the first time a northern team had reached the final.\n\nBefore the final, former England player Jack Hunter, who had joined the club in 1882 in the twin roles of player and coach, arranged to take the team to Blackpool for several days' special training. Such an undertaking had never before been made by a club, and it was considered an extremely novel idea.\nThe Etonians took the lead in the final when Harry Goodhart scored during the first half, however Arthur Matthews equalised for Olympic in the second half. Soon afterwards, Arthur Dunn was injured and forced to leave the field, reducing the Etonians to ten men for the rest of the match. The scores remained level at the end of the regulation ninety minutes. Under the regulations of the FA Cup, thirty minutes of extra time could be played in the event of a draw, at the referee's discretion, and in response to the fervent mood of the crowd the captains asked to play on to try to secure a result. During the extra period, Olympic's superior stamina began to show. Around twenty minutes into extra time, Jimmy Costley received a pass from John Yates and kicked the ball past Etonian goalkeeper John Rawlinson to score the winning goal. Upon the team's return to Blackburn, the players took part in a celebratory parade and received a civic reception at which team captain Albert Warburton reportedly proclaimed \"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London.\"\n\nIn the south, however, Olympic's victory over one of the great amateur teams provoked consternation. At the time, The Football Association (the FA), the sport's governing body, prohibited clubs from paying their players. Despite this, working-class clubs, especially those based in Lancashire, had been widely suspected of making illicit payments to players since at least 1876. In the wake of Olympic's high-profile victory, journalists and officials affiliated with southern amateur clubs intensified their calls for the FA to investigate the finances of northern clubs. They focussed in particular on Olympic's training excursion to Blackpool, suggesting that the players would not have been able to take so much time off work unless the club was paying them some form of wage. Questions were also asked about players who had relocated from one town to another seemingly for the sole purpose of playing for a new football team. In Olympic's case Jack Hunter had moved from Sheffield to join the club. Ultimately no action was taken against Olympic, although punishments were imposed on other clubs, including Preston North End, who were expelled from the FA Cup. This in turn prompted the northern clubs to make plans to break away from the FA and form a rival governing body which would not impose the so-called \"amateur ideal\" on clubs.\n\nThe following season, Olympic again reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, as did Blackburn Rovers. When the draw for the semi-finals was made, the club was paired with Queen's Park in one match and Rovers with Notts County in the other, setting up the possibility of the two teams meeting in the final. The Olympic team, however, were outclassed and defeated 4–0 by their Scottish opponents. The club lodged an appeal with the FA based on the encroachment onto the pitch of some of the 16,000 spectators, but to no avail. Rovers went on to defeat Queen's Park in the final.\n\nThe club was never again able to achieve this level of success. In the 1884–85 season, Olympic lost in the second round of the FA Cup to rivals Rovers, who went on to cement their position as the town's leading team by winning the competition for the second consecutive season. The threat of a schism within the sport was averted in 1885 when the FA agreed to legalise professionalism. In a town the size of Blackburn, however, Olympic found it hard to compete for spectators and sponsors with the longer-established and more successful Rovers, and as a result could not pay wages on a par with those offered by that club or by other professional clubs in Lancashire. In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by Preston North End. Many of the team's key players walked out in response and were quickly signed by wealthier clubs.\n\nThe Football League, the world's first association football league, was formed in 1888 by the leading clubs of the Midlands and North. Aston Villa chairman William McGregor, the driving force behind the new competition, put in place a rule stating that only one club from each town or city could join, and chose Rovers, rather than Olympic, to be Blackburn's entrant. Some of the clubs not invited to join the League, including Olympic, formed The Combination, but this was a poorly organised competition which attracted only small crowds and collapsed before the end of the 1888–89 season. Beset by heavy debts, the club's committee announced in early 1889 that all professional players were being released from their contracts with immediate effect and that henceforth the club would employ only amateur players. This desperate measure came too late to save the club, which closed down in September 1889. Blackburn Olympic's last match was a defeat away to Everton.\n\nOlympic's first match took place on a pitch owned by the Blackburn Cricket Club, situated in open countryside at Higher Oozebooth. For the first eighteen months of the club's existence, Olympic played home matches at various sites in Blackburn, including Roe Lee and Cob Wall. In 1879 the club's committee secured the lease on a pitch adjacent to the Hole-i'-th'-Wall public house, at the top of the Shear Brow hill. The site had previously been used by another club, Queen's Own, but had been left vacant when that club folded after most of its players defected to Blackburn Rovers.\n\nThe playing surface sloped downwards and was initially known for being exceptionally muddy, but in 1880 the club's committee spent £100 improving the drainage. Facilities were minimal and most spectators simply stood around the perimeter of the pitch, as was the case at most football grounds at the time. A grandstand was erected behind one goal in 1881, but it was severely damaged in a storm in 1884 and was replaced by a more elaborate structure along one of the long sides of the playing area. At the same time several other shelters were erected to give spectators in other areas cover from the elements. The largest crowd registered at Hole-i'-th'-Wall was approximately 10,000 for a match against Preston North End in November 1884, but crowds of between 1,000 and 2,000 spectators were the norm at Olympic matches. After the club's demise the pitch was taken over by the Blackburn Railway Clerks Club. It is now the site of St. Mary's College.\n\nAt the start of the club's existence, the players usually wore magenta shirts, although the rules regarding kits were less rigid at the time, and half-back Tommy Gibson insisted on wearing a supposedly lucky amber and black hooped shirt, a practice later copied by teammate Alf Astley. When the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1880, competition regulations meant that all the players in the team had to wear matching colours, and a new combination of light blue shirts and white shorts was chosen. When there was a clash of colours with the opposition and Olympic were the team obliged to change, the players wore dark blue shirts and white shorts. There is no record of the club having a badge or crest, although photographs of the FA Cup-winning team show several players with the crest of the Lancashire FA sewn onto their shirts, indicating that they had represented Lancashire in inter-county matches.\n\nThe club's FA Cup winning team of 1883 comprised eleven players born in England, the first time an all-English XI had won the competition. The team lined up as follows:\n\nJames Ward was the only player to be selected for the England team while on the books of the club. He won one cap, against Wales in 1885. Tommy Dewhurst was originally chosen for an international match in 1884, but was deselected after he was involved in a fight with an opposition player during a match between Olympic and Northwich Victoria. Six other Olympic players represented England either before or after their time with the club: Joe Beverley, Edgar Chadwick, Jack Hunter, Jack Southworth, William Townley and John Yates.\n\nThe concept of a football manager did not exist in the 19th century, although some modern sources identify Jack Hunter as having been the team's manager. Hunter's main responsibility was for the coaching of the players, although in the club's later years he also took charge of seeking out and signing promising amateur players. The club's benefactor, Sydney Yates, held the post of president and his brother Fred served as chairman of the club's committee. The majority of the administration of the club was handled by the secretary, a post held for most of the club's existence by Bill Bramham.\n\nThe club won the following trophies:\n\n\n\n\nThe only competition the club entered but never won, other than the unfinished Combination, was the Lancashire Senior Cup.\n\nBlackburn Olympic's chief rivalry was with Blackburn Rovers. The first match between the two clubs was a game in February 1879, which resulted in a 3–1 win for Olympic. The clubs played each other forty times, but Olympic won only six of these matches. The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to \"poach\" each other's star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the 1884–85 season. In December, however, the clubs were drawn against each other in the FA Cup, and matches between the rivals resumed later that season. Their final meeting was a benefit match for Olympic in February 1889, which Rovers won 6–1. Rovers agreed to allow the financially embarrassed Olympic to keep all available gate money, instead of sharing it.\n\n\n"}

The Empire of Japan forces conducted operations over a variety of geographical areas and climates from the frozen North of China bordering Russia during the Battle of Khalkin Gol (Nomonhan) to the tropical jungles of Indonesia. Japanese military equipment was researched and developed along two separate procurement processes, one for the IJA and one for the IJN. Until 1943, the IJN usually received a greater budget allocation, which allowed for the Super Battleships, advanced aircraft such as the Mitsubishi A6M series, and the world's largest submarines. In addition, a higher priority of steel and raw materials was allocated to the IJN for warship construction and airplane construction. It changed to a degree in 1944/45, when the homeland became increasingly under direct threat, but it was too late. Therefore, during the prior years the Imperial Japanese Army suffered by having a lower budget allocation and being given a lower priority as to raw materials, which eventually affected its use of equipment and tactics in engagements during World War II.\n\nA majority of the materials used were cotton, wool, and silk for the fabrics, wood for weapon stocks, leather for ammunition pouches, belts, etc. But by 1943 material shortages caused much of the leather to be switched to cotton straps as a substitute.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also List of weapons of World War II Japanese aircraft#Army aircraft (IJA)\n<br>and List of weapons of World War II Japanese aircraft#Navy aircraft (IJN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Note: Amphibious Tanks were used by the IJN.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese has used routinely road-railroad convertible automobiles.

{"id": "1916136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916136", "title": "Dielectric heating", "text": "Dielectric heating\n\nDielectric heating, also known as electronic heating, radio frequency heating, and high-frequency heating, is the process in which a radio frequency (RF) alternating electric field, or radio wave or microwave electromagnetic radiation heats a dielectric material. At higher frequencies, this heating is caused by molecular dipole rotation within the dielectric.\n\nMolecular rotation occurs in materials containing polar molecules having an electrical dipole moment, with the consequence that they will align themselves in an electromagnetic field. If the field is oscillating, as it is in an electromagnetic wave or in a rapidly oscillating electric field, these molecules rotate continuously by aligning with it. This is called dipole rotation, or dipolar polarisation. As the field alternates, the molecules reverse direction. Rotating molecules push, pull, and collide with other molecules (through electrical forces), distributing the energy to adjacent molecules and atoms in the material. The process of energy transfer from the source to the sample is a form of radiative heating.\n\nTemperature is related to the average kinetic energy (energy of motion) of the atoms or molecules in a material, so agitating the molecules in this way increases the temperature of the material. Thus, dipole rotation is a mechanism by which energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation can raise the temperature of an object. There are also many other mechanisms by which this conversion occurs.\n\nDipole rotation is the mechanism normally referred to as dielectric heating, and is most widely observable in the microwave oven where it operates most effectively on liquid water, and also, but much less so, on fats and sugars. This is because fats and sugar molecules are far less polar than water molecules, and thus less affected by the forces generated by the alternating electromagnetic fields. Outside of cooking, the effect can be used generally to heat solids, liquids, or gases, provided they contain some electric dipoles.\n\nDielectric heating involves the heating of electrically insulating materials by dielectric loss. A changing electric field across the material causes energy to be dissipated as the molecules attempt to line up with the continuously changing electric field. This changing electric field may be caused by an electromagnetic wave propagating in free space (as in a microwave oven), or it may be caused by a rapidly alternating electric field inside a capacitor. In the latter case, there is no freely-propagating electromagnetic wave, and the changing electric field may be seen as analogous to the electric component of an antenna near field. In this case, although the heating is accomplished by changing the electric field inside the capacitive cavity at radio-frequency (RF) frequencies, no actual radio waves are either generated or absorbed. In this sense, the effect is the direct electrical analog of magnetic induction heating, which is also near-field effect (thus not involving radio waves).\n\nFrequencies in the range of 10–100 MHz are necessary to cause dielectric heating, although higher frequencies work equally well or better, and in some materials (especially liquids) lower frequencies also have significant heating effects, often due to more unusual mechanisms. For example, in conductive liquids such as salt water, \"ion-drag\" causes heating, as charged ions are \"dragged\" more slowly back and forth in the liquid under influence of the electric field, striking liquid molecules in the process and transferring kinetic energy to them, which is eventually translated into molecular vibrations and thus into thermal energy.\n\nDielectric heating at low frequencies, as a near-field effect, requires a distance from electromagnetic radiator to absorber of less than ≈ of a wavelength. It is thus a contact process or near-contact process, since it usually sandwiches the material to be heated (usually a non-metal) between metal plates taking the place of the dielectric in what is effectively a very large capacitor. However, actual electrical contact is not necessary for heating a dielectric inside a capacitor, as the electric fields that form inside a capacitor subjected to a voltage do not require electrical contact of the capacitor plates with the (non-conducting) dielectric material between the plates. Because lower frequency electrical fields penetrate non-conductive materials far more deeply than do microwaves, heating pockets of water and organisms deep inside dry materials like wood, it can be used to rapidly heat and prepare many non-electrically conducting food and agricultural items, so long as they fit between the capacitor plates.\n\nAt very high frequencies, the wavelength of the electromagnetic field becomes shorter than the distance between the metal walls of the heating cavity, or than the dimensions of the walls themselves. This is the case inside a microwave oven. In such cases, conventional far-field electromagnetic waves form (the cavity no longer acts as a pure capacitor, but rather as an antenna), and are absorbed to cause heating, but the dipole-rotation mechanism of heat deposition remains the same. However, microwaves are not efficient at causing the heating effects of low frequency fields that depend on slower molecular motion, such as those caused by ion-drag.\n\nDielectric heating must be distinguished from Joule heating of conductive media, which is caused by induced electric currents in the media. For dielectric heating, the generated power density per volume is given by:\n\nwhere \"ω\" is the angular frequency of the exciting radiation, \"ε\"″ is the imaginary part of the complex relative permittivity of the absorbing material, \"ε\" is the permittivity of free space and \"E\" the electric field strength. The imaginary part of the (frequency-dependent) relative permittivity is a measure for the ability of a dielectric material to convert electromagnetic field energy into heat.\n\nIf the conductivity \"σ\" of the material is small, or the frequency is high, such that (with ), then dielectric heating is the dominant mechanism of loss of energy from the electromagnetic field into the medium.\n\nMicrowave frequencies penetrate conductive materials, including semi-solid substances like meat and living tissue, to a distance defined by the skin effect. The penetration essentially stops where all the penetrating microwave energy has been converted to heat in the tissue. Microwave ovens used to heat food are not set to the frequency for optimal absorption by water. If they were, then the piece of food or liquid in question would absorb all microwave radiation in its outer layer, leading to a cool, unheated centre and a superheated surface. Instead, the frequency selected allows energy to penetrate deeper into the heated food. The frequency of a household microwave oven is 2.45 GHz, while the frequency for optimal absorbency by water is around 10 GHz.\n\nThe use of high-frequency electric fields for heating dielectric materials had been proposed in the 1930s. For example, (application by Bell Telephone Laboratories, dated 1937) states \"\"This invention relates to heating systems for dielectric materials and the object of the invention is to heat such materials uniformly and substantially simultaneously throughout their mass. It has been proposed therefore to heat such materials simultaneously throughout their mass by means of the dielectric loss produced in them when they are subjected to a high voltage, high frequency field.\"\" This patent proposed radio frequency (RF) heating at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 15 to 30 meters). Such wavelengths were far longer than the cavity used, and thus made use of near-field effects and not electromagnetic waves. (Commercial microwave ovens use wavelengths only 1% as long.)\n\nIn agriculture, RF dielectric heating has been widely tested and is increasingly used as a way to kill pests in certain food crops after harvest, such as walnuts still in the shell. Because RF heating can heat foods more uniformly than is the case with microwave heating, RF heating holds promise as a way to process foods quickly.\n\nIn medicine, the RF heating of body tissues, called diathermy, is used for muscle therapy Heating to higher temperatures, called hyperthermia therapy, is used to kill cancer and tumor tissue.\n\nRF Heating is used in the wood industry to cure glues used in plywood manufacturing, fingerjointing, and furniture construction. RF heating can also be used to speed up drying lumber.\n\nMicrowave heating, as distinct from RF heating, is a sub-category of dielectric heating at frequencies above 100 MHz, where an electromagnetic wave can be launched from a small dimension emitter and guided through space to the target. Modern microwave ovens make use of electromagnetic waves with electric fields of much higher frequency and shorter wavelength than RF heaters. Typical domestic microwave ovens operate at 2.45 GHz, but 915 MHz ovens also exist. This means that the wavelengths employed in microwave heating are 0.1 cm to 10 cm. This provides for highly efficient, but less penetrative, dielectric heating.\n\nAlthough a capacitor-like set of plates can be used at microwave frequencies, they are not necessary, since the microwaves are already present as far field type EM radiation, and their absorption does not require the same proximity to a small antenna as does RF heating. The material to be heated (a non-metal) can therefore simply be placed in the path of the waves, and heating takes place in a non-contact process which does not require capacitative conductive plates.\n\nMicrowave volumetric heating is a commercially available method of heating liquids, suspensions, or solids in a continuous flow on an industrial scale. Microwave volumetric heating has a greater penetration depth, of up to , which is an even penetration through the entire volume of the flowing product. This is advantageous in commercial applications where increased shelf-life can be achieved, with increased microbial kill at temperatures lower than when using conventional heating systems.\n\nApplication for microwave volumetic heating:\n\nIn drying of foods, dielectric heating is usually combined with conventional heating. It may be used to preheat the feed to a hot-air drier. By raising the temperature of the feed quickly and causing moisture to move to the surface, it can decrease the overall drying time. Dielectric heating may be applied part-way through the drying cycle, when the food enters the falling rate period. This can boost the rate of drying. If dielectric heating is applied near the end of hot-air drying it can also shorten the drying time significantly and hence increase the throughput of the drier. It is more usual to use dielectric heating in the later stages of drying. One of the major applications of RF heating is in the postbaking of biscuits. The objectives in baking biscuits are to produce a product of the right size, shape, color, and moisture content. In a conventional oven, reducing the moisture content to the desired level can take up a large part of the total baking time. The application of RF heating can shorten the baking time. The oven is set to produce biscuits of the right size, shape, and color, but the RF heating is used to remove the remaining moisture, without excessive heating of the already dry sections of the biscuit. The capacity of an oven can be increased by more than 50% by the use of RF heating. Postbaking by RF heating has also been applied to breakfast cereals and cereal-based baby foods.\n\nFood quality is maximized and better retained using electromagnetic energy than conventional heating. Conventional heating results in large disparity in temperature and longer processing times which can cause overprocessing on the food surface and impairment of the overall quality of the product. Electromagnetic energy can achieve higher processing temperatures in shorter times, therefore, more nutritional and sensory properties are conserved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916137", "title": "Joint Combat Aircraft", "text": "Joint Combat Aircraft\n\nThe Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA) is the official designation of the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence used for the F-35 Lightning II, formerly the Joint Strike Fighter, and the result of the Joint Strike Fighter program.\n\nThe JCA programme began in 1996 as the Future Carrier Borne Aircraft (FCBA), a replacement for the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier intended for operation from the RN's CVF aircraft carriers. The requirement for the FCBA was set out in Staff Target 6464 which specified a carrier-borne aircraft capable of air defence of naval and ground forces and self-escorting ground attack.\n\nAs the UK version of the JCA would operate from the two newly ordered \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class aircraft carriers, the selection of the aircraft was closely linked to the design of the carrier. Candidates for the JCA were thus listed by carrier type:\n\nFollowing the 1998 Strategic Defence Review the Navy's Harrier FA.2s and RAF Harrier GR.7s were merged to form Joint Force 2000 (later Joint Force Harrier). As such the requirement was revised to include the replacement of the RAF Harrier force; this led to the renaming of the project as the Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) in 2001. Later, in the third and final name change of the project, the word \"future\" was removed.\n\nOn 17 January 2001 the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the US Department of Defense for full participation in the Joint Strike Fighter project, confirming the JSF as the JCA. This gave the UK significant input into aircraft design and the choice between the Lockheed Martin X-35 and Boeing X-32. On 26 October 2001 the DoD announced that Lockheed Martin had won the JSF contract.\n\nOn 30 September 2002 the MoD announced that the Royal Navy and RAF will operate the STOVL F-35B variant. At the same time it was announced that the carriers would take the form of large, conventional carriers, which will be adapted for STOVL operations. The carriers, expected to remain in service for 50 years, will be convertible to CATOBAR operations for the generation of aircraft after the F-35 JCA.\n\nIn 2007, the Ministry of Defence confirmed its order for two \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class aircraft carriers, expected to enter front line service with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy from 2018.\n\nThe UK has invested GBP £1.08 billion in development funding for the JSF. Britain has also worked for five years for an ITAR waiver to allow greater technology transfer associated with the project. The effort, backed by the Bush administration, has been repeatedly blocked by US Congressman Henry Hyde because of his concern about potential technology transfer to third countries. On Friday 27 May 2006 President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a joint statement which announced:\nThe CEO of BAE Systems Mike Turner, the British contractor on the plane, had complained that the US has not given the UK (and his company) access to the crucial source code of the plane's software, thus making it impossible for the UK to maintain and modify the JSF independently. On 21 December 2005 an article was published in \"The Herald\" saying that MPs viewed as \"unacceptable\" the US refusal to grant access to the source code. The article quoted the chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee as saying that unless the UK receives assurances of access to the software information, \"the UK might have to consider whether to continue in the programme\".\n\nFollowing on from this Lord Drayson, Minister for Defence Procurement, while on a government visit to Washington to speak to members of Congress, took a firmer stance. He was quoted as saying, ’We do expect [the software] technology transfer to take place. But if it does not take place we will not be able to purchase these aircraft’, and has mentioned that there is a 'plan B' if the deal falls through. A suggested likely option was the development of a navalised Typhoon. Mike Turner has said it was not what he recommend, but:\nAs part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, it was announced that the previous intention to order 138 STOVL F-35Bs had been changed to a smaller number of CATOBAR F-35Cs, with the anticipated entry to service delayed until around 2020. Only one \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class aircraft carrier would be equipped with a catapult, and was expected to normally include twelve F-35Cs in its air wing. In early 2012 the UK joint chiefs of staff publicly petitioned the Prime Minister to change the order back to the F-35B, on the grounds of lower cost, quicker implementation of fixed-wing carrier capability and the ability to operate both carriers with fixed-wing aircraft. On 10 May 2012, Philip Hammond announced that the coalition government had reverted to the Labour government plan to operate the F-35B STOVL variant.\n\nIn 2013 the Defence Select Committee would say \"We urge the MoD to learn the lessons of this closed, rushed and flawed decision of 2010.\"\n\nIn March 2013 it was announced that the F-35 main base will be RAF Marham, in Norfolk, which was recently provided with 300 million pounds by the MOD, for new and improved infrastructure. With the first F-35Bs arriving in 2015, towards an initial operating capability from land in 2018, followed by first of class flights from the same year. Royal Navy F-35s will be operated by 809 Naval Air Squadron.\n\n"}

He was a high school teacher and coach at Cambridge High School in Cambridge, Ohio, and at East Liverpool, Ohio.\n\nEadie's first match was on December 15, 1972 under the name \"The Paramedic.\" Throughout 1973, he wrestled under a mask as the tag team \"Para-Medics\" in The Sheik's Detroit territory. He then wrestled in Pittsburgh, Detroit, WWWF, and the IWA as Bolo Mongol, the new partner of his trainer, Geeto Mongol. He soon entered the Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory under the management of Boris Malenko and donned a mask as The Masked Superstar, given the character at the advice of matchmaker George Scott. It was stated that he was an Olympic champion by various wrestling promoters. He challenged opponents with a $10,000 reward to whoever could break his \"cobra clutch\", as well as utilizing the \"corkscrew neckbreaker\". The Masked Superstar was 6' 3\", weighed 300 lbs and created many mismatches due to his size, strength and quickness. He had many bouts with Mighty Igor, Paul Jones, Blackjack Mulligan, Wahoo McDaniel, Mr. Wrestling II, Stan Hansen and \"Wildfire\" Tommy Rich, and Dick Murdoch.\n\nAlthough primarily a villain, he also appeared as a hero teaming with Jones to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid Atlantic version) twice in 1980-1981. In 1984, he also teamed with King Kong Bundy (also a hero at the time) to defeat The Road Warriors for the NWA National Tag Team Championship (which he had previously held with Super Destroyer in 1982) but was forced to give up the title due to injuries suffered in a mysterious assault (kayfabe). He was the first wrestler (along with Blackjack Mulligan) to have one-hour cage matches, then have a series of \"12\" ninety-minute cage matches against Mulligan. It is believed that neither feat of hour or hour and a half cage matches has since been performed by any wrestlers. He was one of the first wrestlers to body slam André the Giant. Among other accomplishments, he won four Georgia Heavyweight titles and unified that title with the NWA National Heavyweight Championship. He also competed in the World Wrestling Federation against many top wrestlers in 1983-84. He fought against many top level opponents, including then WWF champion Bob Backlund, then WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, future WWF Champion Sgt. Slaughter, and Jimmy Snuka.\n\nIn 1986, he returned to the World Wrestling Federation and became Super Machine with André the Giant as \"Giant Machine\" and Blackjack Mulligan as \"Big Machine\". Eadie was the primary mouthpiece of the team. The three Machines were introduced as rivals of Bobby Heenan and his massive tag team of Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. (The Machines' masks and gimmick were copied from New Japan Pro Wrestling character \"Super Strong Machine\", played by Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata). Eadie later dropped the Machine gimmick and left the WWF to head to Florida for a run as the Masked Superstar, upending Lex Luger to win the NWA Southern title. He held the title for two weeks before Luger regained it.\n\nIn January 1987, Eadie returned to the WWF and formed the tag team Demolition with Randy Colley, formerly Moondog Rex, who wrestled as Smash while Eadie wrestled as Ax. Colley was later replaced by Barry Darsow as Smash, after it was discovered that too many people remembered Colley as Moondog Rex, the character he previously portrayed. Though they began as heels, their unique brawling style and charisma made them so popular that they became faces in November 1988. They won the WWF Tag Team Championship three times as a team of two, but lost the belts at SummerSlam 1990 after they reverted to being heels by forming a threesome with Crush. The trio concept was precipitated by a mutual decision to phase out the Ax character and for Eadie to take a backstage role in the company. Popular rumor at the time cited heart problems on Eadie's part, which have been discredited in recent years. An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of his temporary heart problem. Eadie confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007. Before Eadie was medically cleared, Crush had been recruited as a temporary replacement. Eadie's new position eventually fell through and his final WWF appearance was at Survivor Series 1990. This event also marked the last time that he and Smash worked together for sixteen years.\n\nIn the midst of this time period, Eadie also played opposite Hulk Hogan as \"Jake Bullet\" in the movie \"No Holds Barred\". He and Smash appeared in several Pizza Hut commercials for the \"Kids Night Out\" promotion widely seen on national television.\n\nAround 1991, Ax formed a new tag team, using the Demolition name, and pairing up with a Canadian wrestler, dubbed \"Canadian Giant\" or \"Demolition Hux.\" They toured with New Japan Pro Wrestling, facing established stars such as Masa Saito, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami, at the same time that Smash and Crush were still wrestling under the name for the then WWF and on Japanese tours with Super World of Sports. Eadie would then go on to form a third Demolition team with partner Blast (Carmine Azzato). They competed on a few independent shows, then went their separate ways.\n\nEadie also competed on the Southern independent circuit as The Masked Superstar. On August 15, 1997, Eadie was disqualified in a match against Jimmy Snuka at the \"IWA Night of the Legends\" show in Kannapolis, North Carolina after hitting special guest referee Ricky Steamboat. On March 1, 1998, he defeated Vladimir Koloff in Fredericksburg, Virginia to win the UCW Heavyweight Championship. On March 14, 1999, Eadie and Ben Steele captured the NAWA United States Tag Team Championship from Kane and Abel Atoms in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nIn 2013, Eadie wrestled occasionally for independent promotions and makes signing appearances in \"legends\" shows across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Masked Superstar defeated Greg Valentine for the Mid-Atlantic Heritage Championship. The title changed hands at the Carolina Wrestling Classic on Saturday, June 2, 2007 at the L.P. Frans Stadium in Hickory, North Carolina. The Millennium Wrestling Federation reunited Ax and Smash of Demolition at the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion April 1, 2007, prior to WrestleMania 23 in Windsor, Ontario. They began regularly competing as Ax and Smash for the first time in 16 years. Alongside One Man Gang, Demolition competed in the Chikara King of the Trios Tournament in 2008, but were eliminated in the second round by \"The Fabulous Three\" (Larry Sweeney, Mitch Ryder and Shayne Hawke). On March 28, 2009, Demolition Ax was inducted into the Keystone State Wrestling Alliance (KSWA) Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ax was inducted because of his success, and the fact that he is a native of Brownsville, PA, also in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nOn October 2, 2010 Ax made his third appearance for the Dynamic Wrestling Alliance based in Middletown, Ohio.\n\nOn May 21, 2011, Demolition reunited at Full Impact Pro's debut iPPV \"In Full Force\". Their match against Tony DeVito and Ralph Mosco went to a no contest when local commentator and manager Larry Dallas came out and said his men wanted revenge. The ring was stormed by Manu, Sami Callihan, Blain Rage and Joey Attel. Demolition, Devito and Mosco managed to clear the ring and beat Dallas to end the show.\n\nDemolition returned to Chikara on September 16, 2012, taking part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated The Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive and Max Smashmaster), before being eliminated themselves by their old WWF rivals, The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and Warlord). On June 3, 2017, Eadie announced his retirement, although he went on to have two more matches. His final singles match took place at KSWA's \"Brawl Under the Bridge\" event in the Homestead neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA on July 22, 2017. On August 12, 2017, Eadie had his final match, resulting in a victory in a 6-man tag team match for Georgia Premier Wrestling in Canton, Georgia.\n\nEadie formerly supported the good work of the Inner Harbour Hospital Springs Campus in Rockmart, Georgia. For several years, the Masked Superstar has made many of his masks and wrestling gear available to wrestling fans through raffles and auctions, the proceeds of which support the general operating fund of the non-profit Inner Harbour Hospital, which has since closed and all operations moved to The Shoals campus in Douglasville, Georgia due to a lack of funding.\n\nIn July 2016, Eadie was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\nA long time friend of André the Giant outside of wrestling, Eadie revealed in a 2016 interview that André was the godfather to his two daughters.\n\n"}

At that time, it became mandatory to dial the full 10-digit telephone number, including the zero in the three-digit area code, for local calls (e.g., 011 must be dialed from within Johannesburg). Area codes within the system are generally organized geographically. All telephone numbers are 9 digits long (but always prefixed by 0 for calls within South Africa), except for certain Telkom special services. When dialed from another country, the '0' is omitted and replaced with the appropriate international access code and the country code 27.\n\nNumbers were allocated when South Africa had four provinces, meaning that ranges are now split across the current nine provinces.\nSouth-West Africa (including Walvis Bay) was integrated into the South African numbering plan. However, the territory had already been allocated its own country code by the International Telecommunication Union, +264, in the late 1960s.\n\nFollowing its independence, Namibia discontinued direct dialing from South Africa, and replaced it by international dialing with the +264 country code. For example, for a call from South Africa to Windhoek, before and after 1992:\n\nCalls to Lesotho could be made using the access code 050 instead of the international code +266; for example, to call Maseru from South Africa, subscribers would dial 0501. \n\nCalls to Botswana, Swaziland and Zimbabwe could similarly be made using the regional codes 0192, 0194 and 0191, respectively, instead of the international codes +267, +268 and +263.\n\n00: International access code effective from 16 October 2006 and mandatory from 16 January 2007.\n\n01: The old Transvaal province, currently comprising Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and part of the North West:\n\n02: Western and Northern Cape:\n\n03: KwaZulu-Natal:\n\n04: Eastern Cape and eastern parts of the Western Cape:\n\n05: Free State and Northern Cape\n\n06: Cellular \n\n07: Cellular \n08: Cellular\n08: Special services \n\n\"Note that from 10 November 2006, mobile number portability was introduced in the cellular market.

Among the \"Verses of Chu\" poems usually attributed to Song Yu are those in the \"Jiu Bian\" section. Also credited to Song Yu, somewhat improbably, are several \"fu\" collected in the 6th century literary anthology \"Wen Xuan\".\nBiographic information about Song Yu tends to be anecdotal, rather than truly historical, and little reliable information about Song's life exists. Historical accounts agree that Song was from the state of Chu, and was born in the city of Yan (modern Yicheng, Hubei Province), and lived during the reign of King Xiang of Chu (r. 298–263 BC).\n\nAccording to the section covering literature and art in the \"Book of Han\", Song wrote 16 works, but only 14 of them have been handed down, such as \"Jiu Bian\" and \"Dengtuzi Haose Fu\" (). However, it is uncertain if, with the exception of \"Jiu Bian\", these works were actually written by Song. Wang Yi the noted \"Chu Ci\" anthologist and commentator also attributes the \"\"Zhao Hun\"\" (Summons of the Soul) to Song Yu. As a writer of \"cifu\", Song was an accomplished successor to Qu Yuan with his own original style. In the \"fu\" poems attributed to Song Yu in the Wen Xuan literary anthology compiled by Xiao Tong (501–531), the poems appear in the context of a purported dialogue between Song Yu and King Xiang of Chu, in which the King requests a \"fu\" on a certain subject. However, this is likely to be a literary device deployed by a later author, rather than an authentic historical record of a real event. Song's name has long been put together with Qu Yuan's as \"Qu-Song\". Qu Yuan is known for writing poems with a strong personal voice.\n\nSong Yu's main contribution to Classical Chinese poetry can be considered to be the development of the theme of nature together with an implicit sense of inherent pathos. Apart from proving a rich source of reference points for Chinese poets in centuries to come, many Chinese idioms that are still widely used today can be traced back to his poems.\n\n\n\n"}

Listed at , Splittorff batted and threw left-handed.\n\nSplittorff was born in Evansville, Indiana and grew up mostly in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Arlington High School produced several major league baseball players, including Fritz Peterson, Dick Bokelmann, and George Vukovich.\n\nPeterson and Splittorff pitched against each other twice during their careers, with Peterson winning both matchups. On August 17, 1971, the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 2-0 at Yankee Stadium (in the days before the Designated Hitter, both pitchers went 0-2 at the plate), and on August 22, 1975 at the old Royals Stadium, the Indians beat the Royals, 9-5.\n\nHe was drafted by the Royals in the 25th round of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft out of Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he was a member of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity and also played basketball. He pitched for the Corning Royals in 1968 (a year before the major league club existed), and has the distinction of throwing the first pitch in Royals organization history. He went 28–27 with a 4.01 earned run average in three seasons in the Royals' farm system before receiving his first call to the majors in September . He took the loss in his major league debut, pitching seven innings and giving up three earned runs against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nSplittorff began the season with the Omaha Royals, but after going 5–2 with a 1.48 ERA in eight starts for Omaha, he earned a second promotion to the majors. He stayed with Kansas City for the rest of the season, going 8–9 with a 2.68 ERA.\n\nFrom there, he became a fixture in the Kansas City rotation. He enjoyed his only 20-win season in , when he went 20–11 with a 3.98 ERA. Splittorff was the starting pitcher in the inaugural game at Kauffman Stadium (known at the time as Royals Stadium) on April 10, 1973; Splittorff earned the victory that evening in a 12–1 rout of the Texas Rangers. After finishing second to the Oakland Athletics three of his first five seasons in the majors, Splittorff and the Royals emerged as American League West champions in .\n\nKansas City faced the New York Yankees in every American League Championship Series from 1976 to , with the Yankees emerging victorious in all three. For his part, Splittorff was 2–0 with a 2.84 ERA against the Yankees in the five appearances he made against them in the ALCS. After both teams missed the playoffs in , the Royals and Yankees resumed their postseason rivalry in the 1980 American League Championship Series. Kansas City swept the series, with Splittorff starting the third and deciding game, and receiving a no-decision. The Royals lost the World Series in six games to the Philadelphia Phillies with Splittorff making his only appearance in game six.\n\nNever an All-Star and usually overshadowed by teammates Steve Busby, Dennis Leonard and Larry Gura, Splittorff's consistency and longevity resulted in his winning more games than any of them. Splittorff accumulated 166 career victories over a 15-year career with the Royals.\n\nSplittorff retired when his effectiveness faded. At the same time, the Royals had numerous young pitchers coming through the ranks. His final game was on June 26, .\n\nAfter his retirement, Splittorff became a television color commentator for the Royals. He was inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame in . He also worked as an analyst for Big Eight and Big 12 college basketball telecasts.\n\nOn May 16, 2011, Splittorff's battle with oral cancer and melanoma became public. Nine days later, on the morning of May 25, he died in his Blue Springs, Missouri, home at the age of 64.\n\n\n"}

The term \"iotacism\" refers to the letter iota, the original sign for (), with which these vowels came to merge. The alternative term \"itacism\" refers to the new pronunciation of the name of the letter eta as after the change.\n\nAncient Greek had a broader range of vowels (see Ancient Greek phonology) than Modern Greek does. Eta () was a long open-mid front unrounded vowel , and upsilon () was a close front rounded vowel . Over the course of time, both vowels came to be pronounced like the close front unrounded vowel iota () . In addition, certain diphthongs merged to the same pronunciation. Specifically, Epsilon-iota () initially became in classical Greek, before later raising to () while, later, omicron-iota () and upsilon-iota () merged with upsilon (). As a result of eta and upsilon being affected by iotacism, so were the respective diphthongs.\n\nIn Modern Greek the letters and digraphs (rare), , are all pronounced .\n\nIotacism caused some words with originally-distinct pronunciations to be pronounced similarly, sometimes the cause of differences between manuscript readings in the New Testament. For example, the upsilon of \"hymeis, hymōn\" \"you, your\" (second person plural in respectively ) and the eta of \"hēmeis, hēmōn\" \"we, our\" (first person plural in respectively ) could be easily confused if a lector were reading to copyists in a scriptorium. (In fact, Modern Greek had to develop a new second-person plural, εσείς, while the first-person plural's eta was opened to epsilon, εμείς, as a result of apparent attempts to prevent it sounding like the old second-person plural.) As an example of a relatively minor (almost insignificant) source of variant readings, some ancient manuscripts spelled words the way they sounded, such as the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus, which sometimes substitutes a plain iota for the epsilon-iota digraph and sometimes does the reverse.\n\nEnglish-speaking textual critics use the word \"itacism\" to refer to the phenomenon and extend it loosely for all inconsistencies of spelling involving vowels.\n\n"}
{"id": "1916193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916193", "title": "Terrorism in India", "text": "Terrorism in India\n\nTerrorism in India, according to the Home Ministry, poses a significant threat to the people of India. Compared to other countries, India faces a wide range of terror groups. Terrorism found in India includes Islamic terrorism, separatist terrorism, and left wing terrorism India is one of the countries most impacted by terrorism.\n\nA common definition of terrorism is the systematic use or threatened use of violence to intimidate a population or government for political, religious, or ideological goals.\n\nIndia continues to face a number of terror attacks from Islamic groups in Kashmir, Sikh separatists in Punjab, and secessionist groups in Assam. The regions with long term :terrorist activities have been Jammu and Kashmir, east-central and south-central India (Naxalism) and the Seven Sister States. In August 2008, National Security Advisor M K Narayanan has said that there are as many as 800 terrorist cells operating in the country. As of 2013, 205 of the country's 608 districts were affected by terrorist activity. Terror attacks caused 231 civilian deaths in 2012 in India, compared to 11,098 terror-caused deaths worldwide, according to the State Department of the United States; or about 2% of global terror fatalities while it accounts for 17.5% of global population.\n\nMedia reports have alleged and implicated terrorism in India to be sponsored by Pakistan, but Pakistan always denied Indian allegations and counter alleged India for terrorism fundings against Pakistan ..In July 2016, Government of India released data on a string of terror strikes in India since 2005 that claimed 707 lives and left over 3,200 injured.\n\nThe 8th report on terrorism in India published in 2008 defined terrorism as the peacetime equivalent of war crime. An act of terror in India includes any intentional act of violence that causes death, injury or property damage, induces fear, and is targeted against any group of people identified by their political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature. This description is similar to one provided by the United Nations' in 2000.\n\nThe Indian government uses the following working definition of terrorism, same as one widely used by Western nations as well as the United Nations, proposed by Schmid and Jongman in 1988.\n\nIndia subdivides terrorism in four major groups:\n\nSATP (South Asia Terrorism Portal) has listed 180 terrorist groups that have operated within India over the last 20 years, many of them co-listed as transnational terror networks operating in or from neighboring South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. Of these, 38 are on the current list of terrorist organisations banned by India under its First Schedule of the UA(P) Act, 1967. As of 2012, many of these were also listed and banned by the United States and European Union.\n\nMumbai has been the most preferred target for most terrorist organisations, many operating with a base from Pakistan. Over the past few years there have been a series of attacks, including explosions in Mumbai Suburban trains in July 2006, and the most recent and unprecedented attacks of 26 November 2008, when two of the prime hotels, a landmark train station, and a Jewish Chabad house, in South Mumbai, were attacked and sieged.\n\nTerrorist attacks in Mumbai include:\n\n\nOn 27 October 2013, seven crude bombs exploded in Bihar during an election rally. One was in the Patna Junction railway station, and another near a cinema hall. One person died and six were injured in these two blasts.\n\nIn July 2013, nine bombs exploded in a terror attack at the Bodh Gaya temple complex, a Buddhist shrine, where the Buddha himself is said to have gained enlightenment. In 2014, members of banned Indian Mujahideen and Students Islamic Movement of India were accused and arrested for the blasts.\n\nIn the 1980s, an insurgent movement turned to violence, seeking a separate state called Khalistan, independent of India. They were led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who was neutral on the establishment of a new state.\n\nIn 1984, Operation Blue Star was conducted by the Indian government to confront the movement. It involved an assault on the Golden Temple complex, which Sant Bhindranwale had fortified in preparation of an army assault. Indira Gandhi, India's then prime minister, ordered the military to storm the temple, who eventually had to use tanks. After a 74-hour firefight, the army successfully took control of the temple. In doing so, it damaged some portions of the Akal Takht, the Sikh Reference Library, and the Golden Temple itself. According to Indian government sources, 83 army personnel were killed and 249 were injured. Militant casualties were 493 killed and 86 injured.\n\nDuring the same year, the assassination of Indira Gandhi by two Sikh bodyguards, believed to be driven by the Golden Temple affair, resulted in widespread anti-Sikh riots, especially in New Delhi. Following Operation Black Thunder in 1988, Punjab Police, first under Julio Ribeiro and then under KPS Gill, together with the Indian Army, eventually succeeded in pushing the movement underground.\n\nIn 1985, Sikh terrorists bombed an Air India flight from Canada to India, killing all 329 people on board Air India Flight 182. It was one of the worst terrorist act in Canada's history.\n\nThe ending of Sikh militancy and the desire for a Khalistan catalysed when the then-Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, handed all intelligence material concerning Punjab militancy to the Indian government, as a goodwill gesture. The Indian government used that intelligence to arrest those who were behind attacks in India and militancy.\n\nThe ending of overt Sikh militancy in 1993 led to a period of relative calm, punctuated by militant acts (for example, the assassination of Punjab CM, Beant Singh, in 1995) attributed to half a dozen or so operating Sikh militant organisations. These organisations include Babbar Khalsa International, Khalistan Commando Force, Khalistan Liberation Force, and Khalistan Zindabad Force.\n\nThe 2011 Delhi bombing took place in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday, 7 September 2011 at 10:14 local time outside Gate No. 5 of the Delhi High Court, where a suspected briefcase bomb was planted. The blast killed 12 people and injured 76.\n\nThe Delhi summit on security took place on 14 February 2007 with the foreign ministers of China, India, and Russia meeting in Hyderabad House, Delhi, India, to discuss terrorism, drug trafficking, reform of the United Nations, and the security situations in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.\n\nThree explosions went off in the Indian capital of New Delhi on 29 October 2005, which killed more than 60 people and injured at least 200 others. The high number of casualties made the bombings the deadliest attack in India in 2005. It was followed by 5 bomb blasts on 13 September 2008.\n\nTerrorists on 13 December 2001 attacked the Parliament of India, resulting in a 45-minute gun battle in which 9 policemen and parliament staff were killed. All five terrorists were also killed by the security forces and were identified as Pakistani nationals. The attack took place around 11:40 am (IST), minutes after both Houses of Parliament had adjourned for the day. The suspected terrorists dressed in commando fatigues entered Parliament in a car through the VIP gate of the building. Displaying Parliament and Home Ministry security stickers, the vehicle entered the Parliament premises. The terrorists set off massive blasts and used AK-47 rifles, explosives, and grenades for the attack. Senior Ministers and over 200 members of parliament were inside the Central Hall of Parliament when the attack took place. Security personnel sealed the entire premises, which saved many lives.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, another blast occurred in Varanasi, that killed immediately a toddler, and set off a stampede in which 20 people, including four foreigners, were injured. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamist militant group Indian Mujahideen.\n\nA series of blasts occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. Fifteen people are reported to have been killed and as many as 101 others were injured. On 5 April 2006 the Indian police arrested six Islamic militants, including a cleric who helped plan bomb blasts. The cleric is believed to be a commander of a banned Bangladeshi Islamic militant group, Harkatul Jihad-al Islami, and is linked to the Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistani spy agency.\n\nThe long simmering Ayodhya crisis finally culminated in a terrorist attack on the site of the 16th century Babri Masjid. The ancient Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished on 5 July 2005. Following the two-hour gunfight between Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists based in Pakistan and Indian police, in which six terrorists were killed, opposition parties called for a nationwide strike with the country's leaders condemning the attack, believed to have been masterminded by Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nNortheastern India consists of seven states (also known as \"the seven sisters\"): Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland. Tensions exists between these states and the central government, as well as amongst the tribal people, who are natives of these states, and migrant peoples from other parts of India.\n\nThe states have accused New Delhi of ignoring the issues concerning them. It is this feeling which has led the natives of these states to seek greater participation in self-governance. There are existing territorial disputes between Manipur and Nagaland.\n\nNortheastern regional tension has eased of late with Indian and state governments' concerted effort to raise the living standards of the people in these regions. However, militancy still exists in this region of India supported by external sources.\n\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the area remained a part of the province of Assam. Nationalist activities arose amongst a section of the Nagas. Phizo-led Naga National Council and demanded a political union of their ancestral and native groups. The movement led to a series of violent incidents, that damaged government and civil infrastructure, attacked government officials and civilians. The union government sent the Indian Army in 1955, to restore order. In 1957, an agreement was reached between Naga leaders and the Indian government, creating a single separate region of the Naga Hills. The Tuensang frontier were united with this single political region, Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA), and it became a Union territory directly administered by the Central government with a large degree of autonomy. This was not satisfactory to the tribes, however, and agitation with violence increased across the state – including attacks on army and government institutions, banks, as well as non-payment of taxes. In July 1960, following discussion between the then Prime Minister Nehru and the leaders of the Naga People Convention (NPC), a 16-point agreement was arrived at whereby the Government of India recognised the formation of Nagaland as a full-fledged state within the Union of India.\n\nNagaland became the 16th state of the Indian Union on 1 December 1963. After elections in January 1964, the first democratically elected Nagaland Legislative Assembly was constituted on 11 February 1964. The rebel activity continued, in the form of banditry and attacks, motivated more by inter-factional tribal rivalry and personal vendetta than by political aspiration. In November 1975, the leaders of largest rebellion groups agreed to lay down their arms and accept the Indian constitution, a small group did not agree and continued their insurgent activity.\n\nOver the 5-year period of 2009 to 2013, between 0 and 11 civilians died per year in Nagaland from rebellion related activity (or less than 1 death per year per 100,000 people), and between 3 and 55 militants deaths per year in inter-factional killings (or between 0 and 3 deaths per 100,000 people). The most recent Nagaland Legislative Assembly election took place on 23 February 2013 to elect the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from each of the 60 Assembly Constituencies in the state. The voter turnout was 83% and Nagaland People's Front was elected to power with 37 seats.\n\nAfter Nagaland, Assam is the most volatile state in the region. Beginning in 1979, the indigenous people of Assam demanded that the illegal immigrants who had emigrated from Bangladesh to Assam be detected and deported. The movement led by All Assam Students Union began non-violently with satyagraha, boycotts, picketing, and courting arrests.\n\nThose protesting frequently came under police action. In 1983 an election was conducted, which was opposed by the movement leaders. The election led to widespread violence. The movement finally ended after the movement leaders signed an agreement (called the Assam Accord) with the central government on 15 August 1985.\n\nUnder the provisions of this accord, anyone who entered the state illegally between January 1966 and March 1971 was allowed to remain but was disenfranchised for ten years, while those who entered after 1971 faced expulsion. A November 1985 amendment to the Indian citizenship law allows non-citizens who entered Assam between 1961 and 1971 to have all the rights of citizenship except the right to vote for a period of ten years.\n\nNew Delhi also gave special administration autonomy to the Bodos in the state. However, the Bodos demanded a separate Bodoland, which led to a clash between the Bengalis, the Bodos, and the Indian military resulting in hundreds of deaths.\n\nThere are several organisations that advocate the independence of Assam. The most prominent of these is the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). Formed in 1979, the ULFA has two main goals: the independence of Assam and the establishment of a socialist government.\n\nThe ULFA has carried out several terrorist attacks in the region targeting the Indian Military and non-combatants. The group assassinates political opponents, attacks police and other security forces, blasts railroad tracks, and attacks other infrastructure facilities. The ULFA is believed to have strong links with the \"Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN)\", Maoists, and the Naxalites.\n\nIt is also believed that they carry out most of their operations from the Kingdom of Bhutan. Because of ULFA's increased visibility, the Indian government outlawed the group in 1986 and declared Assam a troubled area. Under pressure from New Delhi, Bhutan carried a massive operation to drive out the ULFA militants from its territory.\n\nBacked by the Indian Army, Thimphu was successful in killing more than a thousand terrorists and extraditing many more to India while sustaining only 120 casualties. The Indian military undertook several successful operations aimed at countering future ULFA terrorist attacks, but the ULFA continues to be active in the region. In 2004, the ULFA targeted a public school in Assam, killing 19 children and 5 adults.\n\nAssam remains the only state in the northeast where terrorism is still a major issue. On 18 September 2005, a soldier was killed in Jiribam, Manipur, near the Manipur-Assam border, by members of the ULFA. On 14 March 2011, Bodo militants of the Ranjan Daimary-led faction ambushed patrolling troop of BSF when on way from Bangladoba in Chirang district of Assam to Ultapani in Kokrajhar killing 8 jawans.\n\nOn 5 August 2016, a terrorist attack was reported in the market area Balajan Tinali of the city of Kokrajhar that resulted in deaths of 14 civilians and injuries to 15 others. Three terrorists, suspected to be Bodo militants, were reported to have attacked using AK-47 and used a grenade.\nOP Singh. Director General of Police said in a press conference the terrorist from the Hizbul Mujahideen group arrested in the city of Kanpur was Qamar-uz-Zama.he is 37 years old and is a resident of Assam.\n\nLike its sister states in Northeast, Manipur has experienced years of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence while it was part of Assam and sought more rights. The state joined India on 21 September 1949, when Maharaja Budhachandra signed a Treaty of Accession merging the kingdom into India; this merger was disputed by various groups in Manipur as having been completed without consensus and under duress. Manipur was part of Assam after 1949, became a Union Territory in 1956. The first armed opposition group in Manipur, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), was founded in 1964, which declared that it wanted to gain more rights or outright independence from India. After several rounds of negotiations, Manipur became a full state in 1972 along with several other sister states of the Northeast. Post statehood, more groups continued to form in Manipur, each with different goals, and deriving support from diverse ethnic groups in Manipur. For example, in 1977 the People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) was formed, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was formed in 1978. In 1980, the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) was formed. These groups began a spree of bank robberies and attacks on police officers and government buildings. The state government appealed to the central government in New Delhi for support in combating this violence. In 1980, the central government brought the entire state of Manipur under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) because its state government claimed that the use of the Armed Forces in aid of the state and local police is necessary to prevent violent deaths and to maintain law and order.\n\nThe violence in Manipur includes significant inter-ethnic tribal rivalry. There is violence between the Meiteis, Nagas, Kukis and other tribal groups. They have formed splinter groups who disagree with each other. Other than UNLF, PLA and PREPAK mentioned above, other Manipuri insurgent groups include Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF), Manipur Liberation Front Army (MLFA), Kanglei Yawol Khnna Lup (KYKL), Revolutionary Joint Committee (RJC), Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF), Kuki National Front (KNF), Kuki National Army (KNA), Kuki Defence Force (KDF), Kuki Democratic Movement (KDM), Kuki National Organisation (KNO), Kuki Security Force (KSF), Chin Kuki Revolutionary Front (CKRF), Kom Rem Peoples Convention (KRPC), Zomi Revolutionary Volunteers (ZRV), Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), Zomi Reunification Organisation (ZRO), and Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC).\n\nAccording to SATP (the South Asia Terrorism Portal), there has been a large decline in fatalities in Manipur in recent decades. Since 2010, about 25 civilians have died in militants-related violence (about 1 per 100,000 people), dropping further to 21 civilian deaths in 2013 (or 0.8 per 100,000 people). Most of these deaths have been from inter-factional violence. Elections have been held regularly over recent decades. The last state assembly elections were held in 2012, with 79.2% voter turnout and the incumbent re-elected to power.\n\nIn 1947, Mizoram was part of Assam, and its districts were controlled by hereditary tribal chiefs. The educated elites among the Mizos campaigned against the tribal chiefdom under the banner of Mizo Union. As a result of their campaign, the hereditary rights of the 259 chiefs were abolished under the Assam-Lushai District (Acquisition of Chief's Rights) Act, 1954. Village courts, which used to exist prior to British colonial re-structuring of Assam, were re-implemented in Mizo region. All of these regions were frustrated by these arrangements and centralized Assam governance. The Mizos were particularly dissatisfied with the government's inadequate response to the 1959–60 mautam famine. The Mizo National Famine Front, a body formed for famine relief in 1959, later developed into a new political organisation, the Mizo National Front (MNF) in 1961. A period of protests and armed insurgency followed in the 1960s, with MNF seeking independence from India.\n\nIn 1971, the government agreed to convert the Mizo Hills into a Union Territory, which came into being as Mizoram in 1972. Following the Mizoram Peace Accord (1986) between the Government and the MNF, Mizoram was declared a full-fledged state of India in 1987. Mizoram got two seats in the Parliament, one each in the Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. Per the accord, insurgents surrendered their arms. The first election of Mizoram Legislative Assembly was held on 16 February 1987. Elections have been held at 5 year intervals since then. The most recent Mizoram elections were held for 40 seats of legislative assembly on 25 November 2013. The voter turnout was 81%. The Indian National Congress led by Lal Thanhawla was re-elected to power. The region has been peaceful in recent decades. Between 2006 and 2013, between 0 and 2 civilians have died each year from any protest-related violence (or less than 0.2 people per 100,000).\n\n2008 Bangalore serial blasts occurred on 25 July 2008 in Bangalore, India. A series of nine bombs exploded in which two people were killed and 20 injured. According to the Bangalore City Police, the blasts were caused by low-intensity crude bombs triggered by timers.\n\n2010 Bangalore stadium bombing occurred on 17 April 2010 in M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore, India. Two bombs exploded in a heavily packed Cricket stadium in which fifteen people were injured. A third bomb was found and defused outside the stadium.\n\nAndhra Pradesh is one of the few southern states affected by terrorism, although of a far different kind and on a much smaller scale. The terrorism in Andhra Pradesh stems from the People's War Group (PWG), popularly known as Naxalites.\n\nThe PWG has been operating in India for over two decades, with most of its operations in the Telangana region in Andhra Pradesh. The group is also active in Odisha and Bihar. Unlike the Kashmiri insurgents and ULFA, PWG is a Maoist terrorist organisation and communism is one of its primary goals.\n\nHaving failed to capture popular support in the elections, they resorted to violence as a means to voice their opinions. The group targets Indian Police, multinational companies, and other influential institutions in the name of the communism. PWG has also targeted senior government officials, including the attempted assassination of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu.\n\nIt reportedly has a strength of 800 to 1,000 well armed militants and is believed to have close links with the Maoists in Nepal and the LTTE of Sri Lanka. According to the Indian government, on an average, more than 60 civilians, 60 naxal rebels and a dozen policemen are killed every year because of PWG led insurgency.\n\n25 August 2007 Hyderabad bombings, two bombs exploded almost simultaneously on 25 August 2007 in Hyderabad, capital of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The first bomb exploded in Lumbini Amusement Park at 19:45 hrs IST. The second bomb exploded five minutes later at 19:50 in Gokul Chat Bhandar.\n\nThe Mecca Masjid bombing occurred on 18 May 2007 inside the Mecca Masjid, (or \"Makkah Masjid\") a mosque the old city area in Hyderabad, capital of the Indian state of Telangana (then undivided Andhra Pradesh) located very close to Charminar. The blast was caused by a cellphone-triggered pipe bomb. Fourteen people were reported dead in the immediate aftermath, of whom five(official record:disputed) were killed by the police firing after the incident while trying to quell the mob.\n\nThe most recent 2013 Hyderabad blasts occurred around 19:00 IST. The two blasts occurred in the Indian city of Hyderabad's Dilsukhnagar. The simultaneous blasts occurred near a bus stop and a cinema.\n\nTamil Nadu had LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) militants operating in the Tamil Nadu state up until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. LTTE had given many speeches in Tamil Nadu led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, Tamilselvan, and other Eelam members. The Tamil Tigers, now a banned organisation, had been receiving many donations and support from India in the past. The Tamil Nadu Liberation Army is a militant Tamil movement in India that has ties to LTTE.\n\nMeenambakkam bomb blast was an explosion that occurred on 2 August 1984 at Meenambakkam International Airport at Chennai, Tamil Nadu. 33 persons were killed and 27 others were injured. The Tamil Eelam Army was suspected. Several members were convicted in 1998.\n\nTamil Nadu also faced terrorist attacks orchestrated by Muslim fundamentalists. For more information, see 1998 Coimbatore bombings.\n\nTerrorism has also been depicted in various Indian films, prominent among them being Mani Ratnam's \"Roja\" (1992) and \"Dil Se..\" (1998), Govind Nihlani's \"Drohkaal\" (1994), Santosh Sivan's \"The Terrorist\" (1999), Anurag Kashyap's \"Black Friday\" (2004) on the 1993 Bombay bombings, \"Fanaa\" (2006), and recently \"Sikandar\" (2009) on Terrorism in Kashmir. Raj Kumar Gupta's \"Aamir\" (2008) and Amal Neerad's \"Anwar\" (2010) are other examples.\n\n\n\n"}

With \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" and some 600 other songs for voice and piano, Schubert contributed transformatively to the genre of \"Lied\". \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" was composed for soprano voice but has been transposed to accommodate other voice types. Schubert composed \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" on 19 October 1814, three months before his eighteenth birthday (; ).\n\n<poem lang=\"de\">Meine Ruh' ist hin,\nMein Herz ist schwer;\nIch finde sie nimmer\nUnd nimmermehr.\n\nWo ich ihn nicht hab'\nIst mir das Grab,\nDie ganze Welt\nIst mir vergällt.\n\nMein armer Kopf\nIst mir verrückt,\nMein armer Sinn\nIst mir zerstückt.\n\nMeine Ruh' ist hin,\nMein Herz ist schwer;\nIch finde sie nimmer\nUnd nimmermehr.\n\nNach ihm nur schau' ich\nZum Fenster hinaus,\nNach ihm nur geh' ich\nAus dem Haus.\n\nSein hoher Gang,\nSein' edle Gestalt,\nSeines Mundes Lächeln,\nSeiner Augen Gewalt,\n\nUnd seiner Rede\nZauberfluß,\nSein Händedruck,\nUnd ach sein Kuß!\n\nMeine Ruh' ist hin,\nMein Herz ist schwer,\nIch finde sie nimmer\nUnd nimmermehr.\n\nMein Busen drängt\nSich nach ihm hin.\nAch dürft ich fassen\nUnd halten ihn!\n\nUnd küssen ihn\nSo wie ich wollt',\nAn seinen Küssen\nVergehen sollt'!</poem>\n\nThe song is in three sections, exactly reflecting the form of Goethe's poem . On the other hand, Schubert contradicts Gretchen's return to composure in the last three stanzas by obsessively repeating her words to create a second climax on the highest note of the song .\n\nThe song opens with Gretchen at her spinning wheel, thinking of Faust and all that he had promised. The accompaniment in the right hand mimics the perpetual movement of the spinning-wheel and the left hand imitates the foot treadle. The initial key of D minor sets a longing tone as Gretchen begins to sing of her heartache (\"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer\"). The first section progresses from D minor to C major, A minor, E minor, F major, and then returns back to D minor. This, plus the crescendo, builds tension which releases only to be brought back to the beginning, much like the ever-circling spinning wheel. The song modulates to F major as Gretchen starts talking of Faust (\"Sein hoher Gang/Sein' edle Gestalt\"). The left-hand imitation of the treadle disappears and is replaced with block chords, giving this section a more free feeling. Additionally, the absence of the rhythmic, consistent treadle allows Gretchen to lose her sense of stability and reality as she swoons over Faust. This section increases tension with a faster tempo, louder dynamics, and higher pitch in the soprano and peaks at Gretchen's remembrance of Faust's kiss (\"Und ach, sein Kuß!\"). Similar to the previous section, the music returns to the home key of D minor as Gretchen resumes reality and begins her spinning once more. The third part begins again with \"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer,\" but this time Gretchen escalates in intensity much faster than the previous sections. However, the treadle-like left hand is present, keeping her rooted in reality. Gretchen comes down from this fantasy quicker than before, as she realizes she and Faust will never be together. With a heavy heart, Gretchen comes to terms with this hard truth. The song ends as it began: in D minor, alluding to the monotony of the spinning wheel, and how reality is always present.\n\nNotable recordings include those by\nOther notable recordings include those by Kathleen Ferrier, Renée Fleming, Dawn Upshaw, Christa Ludwig, Gundula Janowitz, Jessye Norman, Irmgard Seefried, Elisabeth Schumann, Lotte Lehmann, Rosette Anday, and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.\n\n\n"}

She is sometimes locally known as Potentiana and is often coupled with her sister, Praxedes the martyr.\n\nAccording to her \"acta\", written by the Bollandists in the 8th century, and the Martyrology of Reichenau, she was a Roman virgin of the early Christian church, daughter of Saint Pudens, \"friend of the Apostles\", and sister of Praxedes. Praxedes and Pudentiana, together with presbyter Pastor and Pope Pius I, built a baptistry in the church inside their father's house, and started to baptize pagans. Pudentiana died at the age of 16, possibly a martyr, and is buried next to her father Pudens, in the Priscilla catacombs on the via Salaria.\n\nWhile there is evidence for the life of Pudens, there is no direct evidence for either Pudentiana or Praxedes. It is possible that the early Church's \"\"ecclesia Pudentiana\"\" (i.e., the Church of Pudens) was mistaken for \"Saint Pudentiana\".\n\nA basilica in Rome is named for her, and her commemoration in the General Roman Calendar fell on 19 May until its 1969 revision. Pudentiana is now mentioned neither there nor in the Roman Martyrology.\n\nThe Spanish Conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi, the founder of the modern City of Manila, gained possession of the territory on 19 May 1571. As it was the Feast of Pudentiana (in Spanish \"Potenciana\"), Legazpi declared her patroness of what is now the Philippines.\n\nBy the Apostolic Letter \"Impositi Nobis\" of 12 September 1942, Pope Pius XII, at the request of the Philippine episcopacy, declared the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception as principal patroness of the country, with Saints Pudentiana and Rose of Lima as secondary patronesses, mentioning that historical documents indicated Pudentiana as patroness from the 16th century and Rose of Lima from the 17th. Today, Intramuros (the walled Spanish citadel that was the nucleus of Manila) still has a street that bears her name.\n\nThe name Pudentiana is also the name of an unrelated ancient town and episcopal see in the Roman province of Numidia, which is among the titular sees listed in the Annuario Pontificio. Two holders of the titular see have become cardinals: Mario Casariego y Acevedo and Oscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga.\n\n\n"}

Coming full circle, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment as a whole in February 2013, re-uniting \"1Up.com\" with its original owners. Shortly after the acquisition, however, Ziff Davis announced that in an effort to concentrate on IGN, it would shut down most of its secondary sites, including \"1Up.com\".

The Metro Chairman was elected by the members of Metropolitan Toronto Council.\n\nThe position was created in 1954 when Metropolitan Toronto was created by the province of Ontario as a new urban county-level municipality out of the southernmost part of the-then York County. It had exactly the same boundaries as the present-day City of Toronto, but originally consisted of thirteen cities and boroughs, each with its own mayor. These cities included the City of Toronto and what were then its surrounding suburbs: the towns of New Toronto, Mimico, Weston, and Leaside; the villages of Long Branch, Swansea, and Forest Hill; and the townships of Etobicoke, York, North York, East York, and Scarborough.\n\nMetropolitan Toronto was the government entity responsible for co-ordinating various activities within the metropolitan area, including policing and transportation.\n\nFred Gardiner was appointed by the Premier of Ontario Leslie Frost as the first Metro Chairman. He was subsequently re-elected to the position by Metro Council.\n\nMetro's first two chairmen—Fred Gardiner and William R. Allen—were each honoured with an expressway bearing their name upon retirement.\n\nFor Metro's first three decades, the Metro Chairman was not required to be an elected member of Metro Council, and it was customary for a new Metro Chairman to resign from his previous position upon becoming chairman.\n\nIn 1987, Metro Council was reformed by the province so that Metro councillors were directly elected to the body. (They had previously been drawn from among local city and borough councils.) Under this reform, the chair was required to be a Metro Councillor representing a ward and could not be a non or former member of Metro Council. City mayors, who remained on the reformed Metro Council, were also not permitted to be elected to the position of Metro Chairman.\n\nAccordingly, in the 1988 municipal election incumbent Metro Chairman Dennis Flynn was required to run for election from a Metro ward if he wanted to be re-elected as Metro Chairman. As well, Alan Tonks, ran for a Metro Council seat rather than for re-election as Mayor of York as he wished to challenge Flynn for the position of Metro Chairman which was voted upon by Metro Council at its first meeting following the municipal election. Both Flynn and Tonks were elected as Metro Councillors and Tonks defeated Flynn in the vote for Metro Chairman.\n\nThe position ceased to exist when the six municipalities of Metro Toronto were amalgamated into the City of Toronto. The newly created position of mayor for the resulting single-tier \"megacity\" replaced not only the mayors of the former Metro municipalities, but also abolished the office of Metro Chairman.\n\n\n"}

It is used to move railroad cars across water obstacles, or to locations they could not otherwise go, and is towed by a tugboat or pushed by a towboat. As such, the car float is a specialised form of the lighter, as opposed to a train ferry, which is self-powered.\n\nDuring the Civil War Herman Haupt used huge barges fitted with tracks to enable military trains to cross the Rappahannock River in support of the Army of the Potomac.\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) operated a car float across the Potomac River, just south of Washington, D.C., between Shepherds Landing on the east shore, and Alexandria, Virginia on the west. The ferry operation ended in 1906. (\"See\" Capital Subdivision.)\n\nThe B&O operated a car float across the Baltimore Inner Harbor until the mid-1890s. It connected trains from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. and points to the west. The operation ended after the opening of the Baltimore Belt Line in 1895.\n\nThe Port of New York and New Jersey had many car float operations, which lost ground to the post-World War II expansion of trucking, but held out until and the rise of containerization in the 1970s.\n\nThese car floats operated between the Class 1 railroads termini on the west bank of Hudson River in Hudson County, New Jersey and the numerous online and offline terminals located in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Bronx & Manhattan.\n\n\nas well as the offline terminal railroads\n\n\nCar float service was also provided to many pier stations and waterfront warehouse facilities (that did not engage in car floating service personally) by the above-mentioned railroads.\n\nAt their peak, the railroads had 3,400 employees operating small fleets totalling 323 car floats, plus 1,094 other barges, towed by 150 tugboats between New Jersey and New York City.\n\nAbandoned float bridges are preserved as part of this history at:\n\nSeveral other abandoned but unrestored float bridges exist in other locations around New York Harbor. A complete list is available at\nSurviving Float Bridges of New York Harbor\n\nFreight cars do not run in the East River Tunnels nor the North River Tunnels (under the Hudson River), in part due to inadequate tunnel clearances of the New York Tunnel Extension.\n\nThe Bay Coast Railroad formerly operated a 2-barge car float connecting Virginia's Eastern Shore with the city of Norfolk, Virginia across the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBetween 1912–1936, the Erie Railroad operated a car float service on the Chicago River in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n\nThe Alaska Railroad provides the Alaska Rail Marine rail barge service from downtown Seattle, Washington to Whittier on the central Alaskan mainland. Additionally, CN Rail provides the Aquatrain rail barge service from Prince Rupert, British Columbia to Whittier.\n\nThe only remaining car float service in operation in the Port of New York and New Jersey is operated by New York New Jersey Rail. This company, operated by the bi-state government agency Port Authority of New York & New Jersey is the successor to the New York Cross Harbor Railroad. Car float service operates between 65th Street / Bay Ridge Yard in Brooklyn, New York and Greenville Yard in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n"}

However, only a few remain, namely the four branches of the Green Line and the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line, with only one (the Green Line \"E\" Branch) running regular service on an undivided street.\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed on August 3, 1964, taking over operations from the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). The MTA itself was formed in 1947 to take over operations of the private Boston Elevated Railway (BERy), which ran rapid transit, streetcars, and buses in the Boston area.\n\nIn 1936, the BERy assigned numbers to its routes for map use, but route numbers were not used on buses until the late 1960s (when the colors were assigned to the remaining rail lines). Additionally, the numbers were only kept the same on and after the 1942 revision of the map; before that they were changed with each new version. A few routes were renumbered around 1967, but most routes have kept their original numbers. Routes were numbered roughly clockwise from South Boston to East Boston.\n\nThis is a table of when each streetcar line was converted to trackless trolley or bus. Only information post-1940 is complete.\n\nAs of 1953 the Metropolitan Transit Authority operated the following streetcar routes. All lines were connected via trackage to the Tremont Street subway (Green Line), but only the 9, 39, 43, 57, 61, 62 and 69 actually operated in the subway.\n\nSee .\n\nSee .\n\nSee .\n\nSee Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line.\n\nThe 29 Mattapan-Egleston via Blue Hill Avenue and Seaver Street ran from Mattapan north on Blue Hill Avenue and Seaver Street (both parts of Route 28) to Egleston. Streetcars last operated on September 9, 1955, and buses began the next day.\n\nIn May 1987, the Orange Line was relocated, and the 29 was extended from Egleston to Jackson Square; some off-peak service extends to Ruggles. The route is now the 29 Mattapan-Jackson Square via Blue Hill Avenue and Seaver Street, with extended service as the 29 Mattapan-Ruggles via Blue Hill Avenue, Seaver Street and Jackson Square.\n\nThe 30 Mattapan-Roslindale via Cummins Highway ran from Mattapan along Cummins Highway to Roslindale Square. Streetcars last operated on April 24, 1953, and buses began the next day.\n\nSince 1995, the MBTA has been extending an increasing number of trips to Forest Hills; now only Sunday trips still end at Roslindale. Forest Hills trips are thus 30 Mattapan-Forest Hills via Roslindale Square and Cummins Highway.\n\nSee Green Line \"E\" Branch.\n\nThe short 40 Arborway-Egleston via Washington Street ran under the Washington Street Elevated between Egleston and Forest Hills, with streetcars last running December 17, 1955 and buses beginning the next day. The route was discontinued in June 1971, and in April 1981 the 42 was extended to cover the former 40 route.\n\nThe 43 North Station-Egleston via Tremont Street was one of two routes to use the Pleasant Street Incline. Before December 5, 1953, when the 9 operated into the same incline, the 43 used the two west tracks. Afterwards, it was realigned to use the two east tracks, allowing for a larger bus transfer area to the west.\n\nThe 43 came out of the portal and used Tremont Street and Columbus Avenue to Egleston. The tracks south of the loop at Lenox Street were last used on June 14, 1956, and the next day Route 43 buses started running from Lenox Street south to Egleston. The rest of the surface tracks were last used November 17, 1961, and the bus route was extended to the portal, where a short-lived subway shuttle connected to Boylston. At the same time, the route was extended on the surface to Boylston.\n\nIn February 1966, the buses were removed from Boylston Street, but they were extended around the Boston Common in June 1972. In May 1987, the south end was truncated from Egleston to the new Rugglesstation, forming the current 43 Ruggles Station-Park & Tremont via Tremont.\n\nThe 47 Massachusetts Station-Dudley was a short route, beginning at Massachusetts Avenue station (now Hynes Convention Center) and running south along Massachusetts Avenue, southwest one block on Columbus Avenue, southeast on Northampton Street and southwest on Washington Street to Dudley. Streetcars last operated September 12, 1953, with buses running the next day.\n\nIn September 1962, the route was merged with the 76 Harvard-Massachusetts Station to form the 1 Harvard-Dudley via Massachusetts Avenue. The old 47 service has since been slightly rerouted.\n\nShort-turn of route 39, see Green Line \"E\" Branch.\n\nSee Green Line \"C\" Branch.\n\nSee Green Line \"B\" Branch.\n\nSee Green Line \"A\" Branch.\n\nSee .\n\nSee .\n\nSee .\n\nThe 79 Arlington Heights-Harvard via Massachusetts Avenue ran between Arlington Heights and the Harvard Bus Tunnel via Massachusetts Avenue. Streetcars last ran November 18, 1955, buses began running the next day, and it was renumbered to the 77 Arlington Heights-Harvard via Massachusetts Avenue in the late 1960s.\n\nSee .\n\nThe 92 Sullivan-Scollay Square via Main line ran from Sullivan south on Main Streetunder the Charlestown Elevated (using Park Street and Warren Street northbound nearCity Square), then over the Charlestown Bridge, west on Causeway Street, and into the Tremont Street subway via the Causeway Street Incline, turning around at the Brattle Loop at Scollay. Streetcars last ran on April 2, 1948, but the tracks were kept until 1962 to access the 100 tracks and Everett Shops.\n\nBus service on the 92 Sullivan-Haymarket via Main began April 3, 1948, and has changed very little. Aside from a few realignments nearCity Square in Charlestown, and an extension to Assembly Square Mall in June 1982, the only real change has been the extension of early morning weekday service to Downtown Crossing in December 2002, operating as 92 Assembly Square Mall-Downtown via Main (normal service is 92 Assembly Square Mall-Haymarket via Sullivan and Main).\n\nThe 93 Sullivan-Scollay Square via Bunker Hill Street line was a variant of the 92, using Bunker Hill Street and Chelsea Street in Charlestown. Streetcars last ran July 1, 1949, and the 93 Sullivan-Haymarket via Bunker Hill Street bus route began operation the next day, using Washington Street between the Charlestown Bridge and Haymarket. Due to the construction of the Tobin Bridge, which opened in 1950, the route in Charlestown was immediately realigned. Not much has changed since then, except in June 2004, when early morning weekday trips were extended to Downtown Crossing as the 93 Sullivan-Downtown via Bunker Hill Street.\n\nThe 100 Elm Street-Sullivan via Fellsway streetcar line last operated on December 16, 1955, running between Elm Street on Fellsway West in Medford and Sullivan, and was bustituted the next day. When the new Wellington station opened in September 1975, the route was rerouted east on Revere Beach Parkway to terminate there; the 100 now operates as Elm Street-Wellington via Fellsway.\n\nThe tracks used to continue north, owned by the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, and later became the 100A bus.\n\nTrack connections to the rest of the system were provided by the otherwise unused streetcar tracks under the Charlestown Elevated from Sullivan south to the Causeway Street Incline, once used by the 92.\n\nThese routes were operated by the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway. They were only given numbers on March 30, 1968, when the MBTA took over, and long after buses replaced them. The numbers refer to the later bus routes.\n\nOnly two lines were left in 1937.\n\nThis streetcar line ran between Stoneham and Sullivan Square, via the tracks of the 100. It ran from the north end of the 100 through the Middlesex Fells on a privateright-of-way west of Fellsway West, and then to Stoneham center. Until around 1940, it continued north to Farm Hill on the Stoneham Branch Railroad.\n\nThe line was bustituted in 1946. In 1968 the MBTA took it over as the 430, and from March 1969 to the end of its service in September 1971, it was the 100A Reading-Sullivan via Main Street and Fellsway.\n\nTwo Quincy routes left Fields Corner on Adams Street and Neponset Avenue, running to Quincy center and then splitting. One line continued to Hough's Neck, and the other to Quincy Point and the Fore River Shipyard. The lines were bustituted in 1948.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916263", "title": "Howard Scott", "text": "Howard Scott\n\nHoward Scott (April 1, 1890 – January 1, 1970) was an American engineer and founder of the Technocracy movement. He formed the Technical Alliance and Technocracy Incorporated.\nLittle is known about Scott's background or his early life and he has been described as a \"mysterious young man\". He was born in Virginia in 1890 and was of Scottish-Irish descent. He claimed to have been educated in Europe, but his training did not include any formal higher education.\n\nIn 1918, shortly before the end of WWI, Scott appeared in New York City. Scott worked in various construction camps, where he picked up on-the-job engineering experience, and in 1918 was working in a cement pouring gang at Muscle Shoals. Following this, Scott established himself in Greenwich Village as \"a kind of Bohemian engineer\". Scott also ran a small business called \"Duron Chemical Company\" which made paint and floor polish at Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Scott's job was to deliver his goods and show his customers how to use the floor polishing material.\n\nAt the end of World War I, Howard Scott helped to form the Technical Alliance which explored economic and social trends in North America; the Technical Alliance disbanded in 1921. In 1920, the Industrial Workers of the World hired Scott as a research director.\n\nScott, together with Walter Rautenstrauch formed the Committee on Technocracy in 1932, which advocated a more rational and productive society headed by technical experts. The Committee disbanded in January 1933, after only a few months, largely because of different views held by Scott and Rautenstrauch as well as widespread criticism of Scott. Scott had \"overstated his academic credentials\", and he was discovered not to be a \"distinguished engineer\".\n\nOn January 13, 1933, Scott gave a speech about technocracy at New York's Hotel Pierre, before a live audience of 400, which was also broadcast on radio nationwide. The speech was subsequently called a \"grave mistake\", \"disastrous\", and \"a complete failure\". Scott had no experience or training as a public speaker.\n\nM. King Hubbert joined the staff of Columbia University in 1931 and met Howard Scott. Hubbert and Scott co-founded Technocracy Incorporated in 1933, with Scott as leader and Hubbert as secretary. Scott remained as the chief engineer of Technocracy Incorporated until his death in 1970. Scott \"argued indefatigably that scientific analysis of industrial production would show the path to lasting efficiency and unprecedented abundance\". Scott gained many supporters within the movement. M. King Hubbert, for example, considered Scott extremely knowledgeable in physics. There was some discontent with Scott's leadership during WWII and a number of technocrats broke away from Technocracy Inc. and established their own breakaway organisation which only lasted for about a year.\n\nTechnocracy Inc. formed in 1931 to promote the ideas of Howard Scott. Scott saw government and industry as wasteful and unfair and believed that an economy run by engineers would be efficient and equitable. He called for the \"price system\" and fiat currencies to be replaced with a system based on how much energy it takes to produce specific goods. Scott called for engineers to run a continental government, which he termed a \"technate\", to \"optimize the use of energy to assure abundance.\" Virtually unknown today, the organization boasted over half a million members in California alone at its peak in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1916268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916268", "title": "O mein Papa", "text": "O mein Papa\n\n\"O mein Papa\" is a nostalgic German song, originally as related by a young woman remembering her beloved, once-famous clown father. It was written by Swiss composer Paul Burkhard in 1939 for the musical \"Der schwarze Hecht\" (\"The Black Pike\"), reproduced in 1950 as \"Das Feuerwerk\" (\"The Firework\") to a libretto by Erik Charell, Jürg Amstein, and Robert Gilbert. In 1954 that musical was turned into the film \"Fireworks\" with Lilli Palmer.\n\n\"Oh, mein Papa\", an instrumental version by trumpeter Eddie Calvert, topped the UK Singles Chart in 1954, and was also a Top 10 hit in the United States.\n\nIt was adapted into English by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons under the title \"Oh! My Pa-Pa\". A recording by Eddie Fisher with Hugo Winterhalter's orchestra and chorus that was made at Webster Hall, New York City, debuted on the Billboard chart on December 12, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5552 (in US) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10614. This recording became a No. 1 hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" chart in 1954.\n\nFisher's version also made the UK Top 10; thus, in the UK, Calvert's version was number one while Fisher's made the top 10, but missed the top spot, and in the U.S., the opposite occurred. Calvert's version was the first UK number one hit recorded at Abbey Road Studios. The song returned to Abbey Road when Brian Fahey conducted an instrumental version in 1960, to be used as a backing track for Connie Francis' English-Yiddish recording for her album \"Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites\". Francis overdubbed her vocals in Hollywood. In June 1966, Francis overdubbed the same playback once more, this time with the original German lyrics for her German concept album \"Melodien, die die Welt erobern\".\n\nU.S. television viewers were re-introduced to the song via the television show \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\". In the episode \"Sing a Song of Papa\", Jim Nabors' Private Pyle enters a talent contest at a nightclub. His rendition of the song wins him $25 and the admiration of the club's owner, who is apparently connected to organized crime, and predictable hi-jinks ensue. The episode closes with Nabors singing the song again with Italian lyrics.\n\nThe song has been performed and recorded by numerous artists since its debut, including Lys Assia, Siouxsie and the Banshees (on 1979's \"Join Hands\", as \"Mother/Oh Mein Papa\"), Björk (on \"Gling-Gló\", as \"Pabbi minn\"), Mino Reitano (on 1980's \"Ciao amico\" with Luca Chinnici (in Italian as \"O mio papà\") and many others. The opening stanza was momentarily quoted in Frank Zappa's song \"Billy the Mountain\" (1972) in place of the word \"fissure\", a reference to Eddie Fisher. The song was also in the episode \"Like Father, Like Clown\" of \"The Simpsons\" sung by Krusty the Clown.\n\n<poem>\nOh, my Papa, to me he was so wonderful,\nOh, my Papa, to me he was so good.\nNo one could be so gentle and so lovable,\nOh, my Papa, he always understood.\n</poem><poem>\nOh, my Papa, so funny, so adorable,\nAlways the clown so funny in his way.\nOh, my Papa, to me he was so wonderful,\nDeep in my heart I miss him so today.\n</poem>\n<poem>Gone are the days when he would take me on his knee\nAnd with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter.</poem>\n\nThe original German version of the song contains passages that more fully give the context to the listener; these don't appear in the English translation. It contains fractured grammar, confusing masculine and feminine nouns and adjectives, as if sung by a non-native German speaker or by a child not yet familiar with proper German speech.\n<poem>\nPapa wie ein Pfeil\nsprang hinauf auf die Seil,\neh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\nEr spreizte die Beine\nganz breit auseinand’,\nsprang hoch in die Luft\nund stand auf die Hand.\nEh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\n\nEr lachte: “Haha, haha”\nund machte: \"Hoho hoho\",\nganz sachte: “Haha haha”\nund rief: “Eh la hopp, eh la hopp\neh la hopp, eh la hopp\neh la hopp, eh la hopp\neh la hopp, eh la hopp.”\n</poem><poem>\nEr ritt auf die Seil\nganz hoch in die Luft\neh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\nDas konnte er machen\nzwölfmal in ohne mieh;\ner lachte dazu\nund fürchtet sich nie.\nEh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp\n\n</poem><poem>\nDann warf er sechs Bänder\nhoch in die Luft\neh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\nEr ließ sie tanzen\nim feirigen Licht\nund strahlte glicklich\nim ganzen Gesicht.\nEh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\n</poem><poem>\nEr warf die sechs Bänder\nhoch in die Luft\neh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\nUnd alles das macht er\nauf schwindlige Heh;\nPapa war die Clou\nvon die ganz Soirée.\nEh la hopp, eh la hopp, eh la hopp.\n\n</poem>\n"}

She is known for her television roles in the BBC drama \"Tenko\" (1981–82), the ITV drama \"Connie\" (1985), and for playing Sable Colby in the ABC soap operas \"The Colbys\" (1985–87) and \"Dynasty\" (1985, 1988–89). Her film appearances include \"Dracula A.D. 1972\" (1972), \"Schizo\" (1976) and \"Troop Beverly Hills\" (1989).\n\nBeacham began appearing on British television in 1967 and made her big screen debut in the 1970 film \"The Games\", before starring opposite Marlon Brando in the 1971 film \"The Nightcomers\". She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role in the NBC sitcom \"Sister Kate\" (1989–90). Her other television roles include Phyl Oswyn in the ITV prison-based drama series \"Bad Girls\" (2003–06), Martha Fraser in the long-running ITV soap opera \"Coronation Street\" (2009), and Lorraine in the Sky One sitcom \"Trollied\" (2012). On stage, she starred as Maria Callas in a 2010 UK touring production of the play \"Master Class\".\n\nBeacham, one of four siblings, was born in Barnet, Hertfordshire, England, the daughter of Joan, a housewife, and a father who was an insurance executive and the managing director of the Grosvenor estate. She attended Barnet's Queen Elizabeth's Girls' Grammar School and later travelled to Boulogne-Billancourt in Paris, France, to study mime with Étienne Decroux, before attending Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.\n\nHer initial goal was to teach dance movement to deaf children, but she began a career in modelling and then began acting in television. Her first screen role was in the BBC series \"The Queen's Traitor\" in 1967, in which she played Mary, Queen of Scots. During an interview, thinking Barnet sounded uninteresting, she told a reporter from the \"Northern Echo\" she was born in Casablanca, where her favourite Bogart/Bergman film was set.\n\nAfter many further guest appearances in television series such as \"The Saint\", \"Callan\", and \"UFO\", Beacham's first film roles were in \"The Games\" directed by Michael Winner, and \"Tam Lin\" directed by Roddy McDowall, both released in 1970. She would work with Winner again in 1971's \"The Nightcomers\", in which she starred opposite Marlon Brando. Beacham appeared nude in one scene, during the filming of which Brando wore Y-fronts and wellington boots under the bed clothes to ensure Winner did not film anything lower than was necessary. Horror would be a genre that Beacham appeared in often during this period, and she was subsequently cast as Jessica Van Helsing in Hammer's \"Dracula A.D. 1972\" alongside Peter Cushing.\n\nBeacham continued to appear in film, television and on stage. Her next role was as a repertory player with the Nottingham Playhouse, where she played several lead and feature roles, including the role of Nora in the Henrik Ibsen play \"A Doll's House\". In 1973, she played Georgina Layton in Thames Television's daytime drama \"Marked Personal\". The same year, she made an Italian film, \"Si può essere più bastardi dell'ispettore Cliff?\" The film was released in the US in 1977 as \"Mafia Junction\" and in the UK as \"Blue Movie Blackmail\". It was later released on home video, now retitled as \"Super Bitch\" as the producers of the film attempted to capitalise on the success of the Joan Collins film \"The Bitch\". Beacham also continued to work in horror films, including \"And Now the Screaming Starts\" (1973), \"House of Mortal Sin\" (1975), \"Schizo\" (1976) and \"Inseminoid\" (1981) – a film she admits taking for the fee.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1982, Beacham featured as a member of the ensemble cast of the BBC series \"Tenko\", about a group of women prisoners of war held captive by the Japanese after their invasion of Singapore in 1942. Following this, she continued working in theatre and television before landing the lead role in the 13-part ITV drama series \"Connie\" (1985). Her roles in \"Tenko\" and \"Connie\" helped to springboard her into one of her most well-remembered roles, that of the devious matriarch Sable Colby on the television series \"The Colbys\" (1985–87). \"The Colbys\" was a spin-off of the opulent prime-time soap \"Dynasty\" which had been the highest rating programme in the USA that year. Beacham was cast opposite Charlton Heston as the tent-pole couple of the new show. \"The Colbys\" never experienced the success of its parent show and was cancelled after two seasons, though in 1988, Beacham was invited to reprise the role of Sable on \"Dynasty\", playing opposite Joan Collins in a season-long \"battle of the bitches\" scenario.\n\nAfter \"Dynasty\" was cancelled in 1989, Beacham landed the lead role in the children's fantasy film \"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\", playing an evil governess. She was then cast in the US sitcom \"Sister Kate\", taking the lead role as a nun taking care of children in an orphanage. The series lasted for one season and was cancelled in 1990, though she earned a Golden Globe nomination for the role. She then returned to Britain to play Mrs. Peacock in an ITV game show version of the board game \"Cluedo\" (1990). Reuniting with \"Dynasty\" producer Aaron Spelling, Beacham also had a recurring guest role in the popular teen drama \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", playing Iris McKay, the estranged mother of Luke Perry's character Dylan. Beacham appeared in six different television series produced by Spelling, including \"Dynasty\" and its spin-off, \"The Colbys\", \"The Love Boat\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", \"Burke's Law,\" and \"Charmed\". In 1993, Beacham signed on to play Dr. Kristin Westphalen in the NBC science fiction series \"seaQuest DSV\", produced by Steven Spielberg. Her character was the chief oceanographer and medical doctor for the submarine \"seaQuest\", however Beacham left the programme after its first season. Throughout the 1990s, she continued to make guest appearances on television programmes, working in both the UK and the US. In 1996, she starred in the BBC drama \"No Bananas\" which was set during the war years.\n\nIn 2003, Beacham returned to the UK to take a role in the ITV prison drama \"Bad Girls\". She played inmate Phyllida \"Phyl\" Oswyn for four years, partnered with Beverly \"Bev\" Tull (played by Amanda Barrie) as the \"Costa Cons\". She remained with the series to the end in 2006. She also appeared in the 2006 movie \"Love and Other Disasters\". She returned to stage work and toured the UK in 2007 as a lead in the Noël Coward play \"Hay Fever\". Later that year, she competed in the 2007 series of the BBC's \"Strictly Come Dancing\" with professional partner Vincent Simone, though she was eliminated early in the competition (the second of fourteen celebrities) on 14 October 2007.\n\nOn 27 November 2008, it was announced that Beacham had joined the cast of ITV's \"Coronation Street\" portraying Martha Fraser, a love interest for Ken Barlow (played by William Roache). She made her first appearance on 26 January 2009 and her last on 4 May 2009.\n\nOn 17 February 2010, Beacham appeared in the final episode of the BBC series \"Material Girl\". On 3 April 2010, she made a guest appearance in the long-running BBC hospital drama series \"Casualty\".\n\nIn October 2011, Beacham released her autobiography \"Many Lives\" in which she discusses her life and career. The book includes a foreword written by her \"Coronation Street\" co-star William Roache.\n\nIn 2012, Beacham reunited with her \"Dynasty\" co-star Joan Collins in a UK television advert for Snickers, however the ad was later re-edited and Beacham's appearance cut. She also appeared as store manager Lorraine Chain in Sky1's supermarket-based sitcom \"Trollied\" for eight episodes between August 2012 and October 2012. The same year, she also appeared in three episodes of Sky Living's \"Mount Pleasant\" as Aunty Pam.\n\nIn January 2013, Beacham was a guest on ITV's daytime chat show \"Loose Women\" to promote her appearance on the first episode of the second series of \"Death in Paradise\" which aired on 8 January 2013.\n\nIn recent years, Beacham has appeared in Christmas pantomime. In 2006, she played the Wicked Witch in a production of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\" in Guildford. She appeared there again the following year in a production of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\".\n\nOn 3 January 2010, Beacham entered Channel 4's seventh and final series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" as a housemate; she was the only female to make it to the final and finished in fifth place on 29 January 2010.\n\nBeacham was involved in launching the Sense-National Deafblind and Rubella Association \"Fill in the Gaps\" campaign which aims to give the elderly the support they need to maintain a good quality of life. She also attended the Parliamentary launch of the campaign in June 2006.\n\nIn September 2016 Beacham was a guest on BBC Radio 2's \"Graham Norton Show\" and discussed her forthcoming role as Princess Margaret.

It was ported to the Commodore 64 in 1985. It is loosely based on Celtic mythology.\n\nThe game was widely positively received by the gaming media. The game forms part of an unofficial trilogy with the science fiction title \"Marsport\" and \"Dun Darach\". \"Dun Darach\" is a direct continuation of the Cuchulainn storyline, whereas \"Marsport\" shares only the game engine.\n\nThe game has many features that were groundbreaking in 1984 such as a large central character, animated backgrounds and parallax scrolling.\n\nPsygnosis Software planned to release a PC remake of the game, helmed by the game's original creators Greg Follis and Roy Carter, in June 1995. However, though near completion, the project was canceled.\n\nTir Na nÓg, Irish for \"Land of Youth\", is the eponymous location for the game. The protagonist, Cuchulainn, has departed the land of the living and finds himself at an altar in this land, essentially an afterlife. His goal is to reunite the four fragments of the Seal of Calum and place it on the altar, all while avoiding the sídhe.\n\nGameplay takes the form of an arcade-adventure with the player controlling the hero as he wanders the land of Tir Na Nog collecting objects, solving puzzles and trying to keep out of the way of the sídhe who also wander the land. Many of the puzzles that Cuchulainn is set are cryptic in nature (e.g. \"The backdoor key is me\") rather than straightforward and may rely on some lateral thinking.\n\nBecause he is in an afterlife, Cuchulainn cannot die and if he is \"defeated\" by a sídhe he is simply transported elsewhere and loses all his carried objects.\n\nThe Land of Tir Na Nog is very large and consists of plains, caverns and forests. Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player \"rotating\" the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen. The player can collect any objects they come across with Cuchulainn being able to carry several at one time. Some of these objects can be used as weapons with the game allowing the player to \"thrust\" with any item.\n\nCrash printed a map of the game in the March 1985 issue, which was later reprinted in \"Zzap!64\".\n\nThe game was well received. \"Zzap!64\" called it \"a REAL arcade adventure.

He became director of the School of Egyptology at Cairo, producing numerous very valuable works and pioneering the decipherment of Demotic, the simplified script of the later Egyptian periods.\n\nHeinrich Karl Brugsch was born in Berlin in 1827. He was the son of a Prussian cavalry officer, and was born in the barracks at Berlin. He early manifested a great inclination to Egyptian studies, in which he was almost entirely self-taught. At the age of 16, he applied himself with success to the decipherment of Demotic, which had been neglected since the death of Champollion in 1832. Brugsch's work, \"Scriptura Ægyptiorum Demotica\" (Berlin, 1848), containing the results of his studies, appeared while he was a student at the gymnasium. It was followed by his \"Numerorum Demoticorum Doctrina\" (1849), and his \"Sammlung demotischer Urkunden\" (1850).\n\nHis 1848 work brought him to the attention of Alexander von Humboldt and Prussian King Frederick William IV. After completing his university course, support from the king enabled him to complete his studies with visits to foreign museums at Paris, London, Turin, and Leyden. In 1853, he was sent to Egypt by the Prussian government in 1853, and contracted an intimate friendship with Mariette, whom he assisted in his work. After this he returned to Berlin, where, in 1854, he was appointed privatdocent in the university, and, in 1855, assistant in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. He visited Egypt again in 1857.\n\nIn 1860 he was sent to Persia on a special mission under Baron Minutoli, travelled over the country, and after Minutoli's death discharged the functions of ambassador.

In 1864 he was consul at Cairo, in 1868 professor at Göttingen, and in 1870 director of the school of Egyptology, founded at Cairo by the khedive. He was soon raised to the rank of bey (1873), and some time afterward to that of pasha (1881) From this post, he was unceremoniously dismissed in 1879 by the European controllers of the public revenues, determined to economize at all hazards; and French influence prevented his succeeding his friend Mariette at the Bulaq Museum in 1883. He afterwards resided principally in Germany until his death in 1894, but frequently visited Egypt, took part in two more official missions to Persia in 1883 (with Prince Frederick Charles) and 1885. He organized an Egyptian exhibit at the Philadelphia Exposition in 1876.\nHe published his autobiography in 1894, concluding with a warm upon British rule in Egypt. Brugsch's services to Egyptology are most important, particularly in the decipherment of Demotic and the making of a vast Hieroglyphic-Demotic dictionary (1867–1882).\n\nHe was buried in Berlin-Charlottenburg.

This is accomplished with devices such as capture hoods to catch dust at its source of origin. Many times, the machine producing the dust will have a port to which a duct can be directly attached.\n\nSecond, the dust must be \"conveyed\". This is done via a ducting system, properly sized and manifolded to maintain a consistent minimum air velocity required to keep the dust in suspension for conveyance to the collection device. A duct of the wrong size can lead to material settling in the duct system and clogging it.\n\nFinally, the dust is \"collected\". This is done via a variety of means, depending on the application and the dust being handled. It can be as simple as a basic pass-through filter, a cyclonic separator, or an impingement baffle. It can also be as complex as an electrostatic precipitator, a multistage baghouse, or a chemically treated wet scrubber or stripping tower.\n\nSmaller dust collection systems use a single-stage vacuum unit to create suction and perform air filtration, where the waste material is drawn into an impeller and deposited into a container such as a bag, barrel, or canister. Air is recirculated into the shop after passing through a filter to trap smaller particulate.\n\nLarger systems utilize a two-stage system, which separates larger particles from fine dust using a pre-collection device, such as a cyclone or baffled canister, before drawing the air through the impeller. Air from these units can then be exhausted outdoors or filtered and recirculated back into the work space.\n\nDust collection systems are often part of a larger air quality management program that also includes large airborne particle filtration units mounted to the ceiling of shop spaces and mask systems to be worn by workers. Air filtration units are designed to process large volumes of air to remove fine particles (2 to 10 micrometres) suspended in the air. Masks are available in a variety of forms, from simple cotton face masks to elaborate respirators with tanked air — the need for which is determined by the environment in which the worker is operating.\n\nIn industry, round or rectangular ducts are used to prevent buildup of dust in processing equipment.\n\nProper dust collection and air filtration is important in any work space. Repeated exposure to wood dust can cause chronic bronchitis, emphysema, \"flu-like\" symptoms, and cancer. Wood dust also frequently contains chemicals and fungi, which can become airborne and lodge deeply in the lungs, causing illness and damage.\n\n"}

When the Waldensians were exiled a second time, Arnaud accompanied them in their exile to Schönenberg, and continued to act as their pastor until his death.\n\nArnaud was born in Embrun, Hautes-Alpes, France. About 1650 his family returned to their native valley of Luserna, where Arnaud was educated at La Tour (the chief village), later visiting the college at Basel (1662 and 1668) and the Academy at Geneva (1666). He then returned home, and seems to have been pastor in several of the Waldensian valleys before attaining that position at La Tour (1685).\n\nHe was thus the natural leader of his co-religionists after Victor Amadeus II of Savoy expelled them (1686) from their valleys, and most probably visited Holland; William of Orange, the ruler of that province, certainly gave him help and money. Arnaud occupied himself with organizing his 3,000 countrymen who had taken refuge in Switzerland, and who twice (1687–1688) attempted to regain their homes. The English revolution of 1688, and the election of William to the throne, encouraged the Waldensians to make yet another attempt. Furnished with detailed instructions from the veteran Joshua Janavel (prevented by age from taking part in the expedition) Arnaud, with about 1,000 followers, started in 17 August 1689 from near Nyon on Lake Geneva for their return. On the 27 August, the band, after many hardships and dangers, reached the Valley of St Martin, having passed by Sallanches and crossed many cols and passes reaching up to 9085 ft. They soon took refuge in the lofty and secure rocky citadel of the Balsille, where they were besieged from 24 October 1689 to 14 May 1690 by the troops (about 4,000 in number) of the King of France and the Duke of Savoy.\n\nThey maintained this natural fortress against many fierce attacks and during the whole of a winter. In particular, on 2 May, one assault was defeated without the loss of a single man of Arnaud's small band. But another attack (14 May) was not so successful, so that Arnaud withdrew his force, under cover of a thick mist, and led them over the hills to the Val di Angrogna, above La Tour. A month later the Waldensians were received into favour by the duke of Savoy, who had then abandoned his alliance with France for one with Great Britain and Holland. Hence for the next six years the Waldensians helped Savoy against France, though suffering much from the repeated attacks of the French troops. By a clause in the Treaty of Turin (1696), made public in 1698, Victor Amadeus again became hostile to the Waldensians, about 3,000 of whom, with Arnaud, found a shelter in Protestant countries, mainly in Württemberg, where Arnaud became the pastor of Dürrmenz-Schönenberg, northwest of Stuttgart, in 1699. Once again (1704–1706) the Waldensians aided the duke against France. Arnaud, however, took no part in the military operations, though he visited England (1707) to obtain financial aid from Queen Anne.\n\nHenri Arnaud is among the later Waldensians who had joined the Protestant Reformation in Geneva.\n\nHe died at Schönenberg, which was the church hamlet of the parish of Durrmenz, in 1721. It was during his retirement that he compiled from various documents by other hands his \"Histoire de la glorieuse rentrée des Vaudois dans leurs vallées\", which was published (probably at Kassel) in 1710, with a dedication to Queen Anne. It was translated into English (1827) by H. Dyke Acland, and has also appeared in German and Dutch versions. A part of the original MS. is preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916374", "title": "Henri Martin (historian)", "text": "Henri Martin (historian)\n\nHenri Martin (a.k.a. Bon Louis Henri Martin) (20 February 1810 in Saint-Quentin, Aisne – 14 December 1883 in Paris) was a French historian, who was celebrated in his own day but whose modern reputation has been eclipsed by the greater literary and interpretive powers of his contemporary, the equally passionate patriot Jules Michelet, whose works have often been reprinted. After publishing a few novels, Martin devoted his life to the study of the history of France, writing \"Histoire de France\", a formidable work in 13 volumes (1833-1836). He later brought the history down to 1789 in the 4th edition (19 vols., 1865), and received from the Institut de France 20,000 francs as a prize in 1869. The Avenue Henri-Martin in Paris is named after him.\n\nMartin was born in Saint-Quentin into an upper-middle-class family. Trained as a notary, he followed this profession for some time but having achieved success with an historical romance, \"Wolfthurm\" (1830), he applied himself to historical research. Martin sat in the \"Assemblée Nationale\" as deputy for Aisne in 1871, and was elected on 13 June 1878 to seat number 38 of the Académie française, but he left no mark as a politician. Redactor at the \"Siècle\", he was also mayor of the 16th arrondissement of Paris in 1870, deputy of Paris in 1871, senator in 1876, and one of the founders and the first president of the \"Ligue des Patriotes\". He died in Paris on 14 December 1883 and, acclaimed as \"national historian\", was given a public funeral. A laudatory biography soon appeared: Gabriel Hanotaux, \"Henri Martin\", Paris, 1885.\n\nBecoming associated with Paul Lacroix (\"Le Bibliophile Jacob\"), he planned with him a history of France to consist of excerpts from the chief chroniclers and historians, with original matter filling up gaps in the continuity. In the first volume, which appeared in 1833, \"Histoire de France depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'en juillet 1830\" the compiler promised to seek \"always the dramatic and picturesque side of history, the one that interests the greatest number\"; its success encouraged Martin to make the work his own, and his \"Histoire de France\", in 15 volumes (1833–1836) which spans the space from earliest times to the French Revolution of 1789, was the result. This magnum opus, rewritten and further elaborated during the following 18 years of research (4th ed., 16 vols. and index, 1861–1865) gained for him in 1856 the first prize of the Academy, and in 1869 the grand biennial prize of 20,000 francs. A popular abridgement, \"L'Histoire de France Populaire\" (7 vols.) was published in 1867. This, together with the continuation, \"Histoire de France depuis 1789 jusqu'à nos jours\" (History of France from 1789 to the Present Time) (6 vols. 1878-1883), gives a complete history of France, superseding Sismondi's \"Histoire des Français\" as the #1 French history of the 19th century.\n\nAlas, this monumental work has not withstood the test of time. Martin's romanticized descriptions of Gauls as representing the Druidic key to France's essentialist \"primitive tradition\" are based on his longstanding close ties with the Saint-Simonian counter-Enlightenment philosopher Jean Reynaud rather than on objective history. However flawed, his popularized accounts gave a great impetus to Celtic linguistic and anthropological studies. His knowledge of the Middle Ages is inadequate, and his criticisms are not discriminating. As a free-thinking liberal republican outside the Roman Catholic Church, his prejudices often biased his judgment on the political and religious history of the \"ancien régime\". The last six volumes, devoted to the 17th and 18th centuries, are superior to the earlier ones.\n\nIn his essay \"De la France, de son génie et de ses destinées\" (1847) he sought to give the French a sense of their essentially national destiny within the framework of Romantic nationalism. Other minor works included \"Daniel Manin\" (1860), \"La Russie et l'Europe\" (1866), \"Etudes d'archéologie celtique\" (1872), and \"Les Napoléon et les frontières de la France\" (1874).\nMartin was distinguished by an extremely hostile attitude towards Russia. One of his main works, \"Russia and Europe\" (1866), which arose under the influence of racist ideas of the pole-emigrant Francis Dukhinsky, Vice-President of the Paris ethnographic society, describes the Russian (\"Muscovites\") as prone to despotism barbaric people of non-European (Turan) origin, unjustly appropriated the history of Russia.\n\n"}

In his writing he combines instinct with pathos, humour, and sadness. The book is the basis for the 1896 opera \"La bohème\" by Puccini, Leoncavallo's opera of the same name, and, at greater removes, the zarzuela \"Bohemios\" (Amadeu Vives), the 1930 operetta \"Das Veilchen vom Montmartre\" (Kálmán), and the 1996 Broadway musical \"Rent\". He wrote lyrics as well as novels and stories, the chief being \"La Chanson de Musette,\" \"a tear,\" says Gautier, \"which has become a pearl of poetry\".\n\nMurger was born and died in Paris. He was the son of a Savoyard immigrant who worked as a tailor and janitor for an apartment building in the Rue Saint Georges. He had a scanty and fragmented education. After leaving school at 15 he worked in a variety of menial jobs before securing one in a lawyer's office. While there he also wrote poetry which came to the attention of the French writer Étienne de Jouy. De Jouy's connections enabled him to secure the position of secretary to Count Tolstoi, a Russian nobleman living in Paris. Murger's literary career began about 1841. His first essays were mainly literary and poetic, but under the pressure of earning a living he wrote whatever he could find a market for, turning out prose as he put it, \"at the rate of eighty francs an acre\". At one point he edited a fashion newspaper, \"Le Moniteur de la Mode\", and a paper for the millinery trade, \"Le Castor\". His position gradually improved when the French writer Champfleury, with whom he lived for a time, urged Murger to devote himself to fiction. His first big success was \"Scènes de la vie de bohème\". In 1851 Murger published a sequel, \"Scènes de la vie de jeunesse\". Several more works followed, but none of them brought him the same popular acclaim.\nHe lived much of the next ten years in a country house outside Paris, dogged by financial problems and recurrent ill health. In 1859 he received the Légion d'honneur but within two years he was almost penniless and dying in a Paris hospital. Napoleon III's minister Count Walewski sent 500 francs to help pay his medical expenses, but it was too late. Henri Murger died on 28 January 1861 at the age of 38. The French government paid for his funeral, which from contemporary accounts in \"Le Figaro\" was a great public occasion attended by 250 luminaries from journalism, literature, theatre, and the arts. \"Le Figaro\" also started a fund to raise money for his monument. Hundreds of people contributed and within two months it had raised over 6500 francs.\n\nEarly in his career, in an effort to make himself appear more \"elegant and noticeable\", Murger signed his name as \"Henry Mürger\", the English-looking \"y\" and German-looking umlaut both being exotic in French. - though the spelling of rather than was also archaic French, having been standard orthography (along with such spellings as loy and roy) prior to c. 1775 and not totally supplanted by \"i\" until after 1790. After experimenting with other variations he eventually kept the former but dropped the latter, so that all of his best-known works were published under the name \"Henry Murger\".\n\n\nIn English translation\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

It is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List, on account of its widespread range in the Tibetan Plateau's steppes and semi-deserts.\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as the Tibetan fox, or simply as the sand fox, but this terminology is confusing because the corsac fox (\"Vulpes corsac\"), which lives in arid environments north and west of the Tibetan Plateau, is often called the \"sand fox\" or \"Tibetan fox\" as well. The Rüppell's fox (\"Vulpes rueppellii\") is also known as the \"sand fox\", but is native to arid desert regions of North Africa and Middle East.\n\nThe Tibetan fox is small and compact, with soft, dense coats and conspicuously narrow muzzles and bushy tails. Its muzzle, crown, neck, back and lower legs are tan to rufous coloured, while its cheeks, flanks, upper legs and rumps are grey. Its tail has white tips.

Licensed to Corona, it is the Spanish-language network's West Coast flagship station. KVEA is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), as part of a duopoly with Los Angeles-licensed NBC West Coast flagship KNBC (channel 4). The two stations share studios in the northwest corner of the Universal Studios Hollywood lot off of Lankershim Boulevard in Universal City; KVEA's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.\n\nKVEA first went on the air on June 29, 1966 as independent station KMTW-TV. The station was founded by Mount Wilson Broadcasting, which planned to expand into the television market. Mount Wilson Broadcasting sold the station's license to Kaiser Broadcasting (which owned UHF independents in several large media markets) before KMTW's debut. It was the third commercial UHF station in Los Angeles, after KIIX-TV (channel 22, now KWHY-TV) and KMEX-TV (channel 34). Kaiser changed channel 52's call letters to KBSC-TV, standing for \"Kaiser Broadcasting Southern California\" (the KMTW call sign is currently used by a MyNetworkTV affiliate in Wichita, Kansas).\n\nKBSC was never a serious competitor against established independents KTLA (channel 5), KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV), KTTV (channel 11) and KCOP (channel 13). Few television sets could receive UHF broadcasts at the time, and there was insufficient program inventory.\n\nThe station operated on a half-day schedule, usually signing on in the early afternoon and signing off in the late evening. KBSC carried general entertainment: cartoons, short films, sitcoms and old movies. Weekday-afternoon programming was directed at children, with Japanese cartoons dubbed into English (including \"Speed Racer\", \"Kimba the White Lion\", \"Ultraman\", \"Johnny Sokko\" and \"Gigantor\") and compilations of comedy short subjects by the Three Stooges and the Little Rascals.\n\nKBSC also aired programs produced by other Kaiser stations, such as WKBD's \"Lou Gordon Program\". Gordon's weekly show was broadcast at least twice a week (on Saturdays and Sundays) during the early 1970s. Programs rarely flowed smoothly from one to the next; most of the children's programming was punctuated by long breaks, consisting of a shot of the station's logo, call letters and city of license accompanied by Bert Kaempfert's \"That Happy Feeling\". The logo was a black \"52\" joined at the top within a white television screen, typical of Kaiser stations; the logo and song began its broadcast day.\n\nIn 1976 Kaiser left broadcasting and sold its stations to its partner, Field Communications, except for KBSC and a minority stake in Cleveland station WUAB; the latter was sold by majority owner United Artists to Gaylord Broadcasting. KBSC, not included in the deal due to its low ratings and lack of growth potential in the Los Angeles market, was sold to Oak Communications.\n\nThe station's general-entertainment format initially remained the same from its noon sign-on. By April 1977, KBSC's programming ran from 1:15 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. It then became the Los Angeles-area outlet of ONTV, which carried movies and live sports and whose programming aired after 8:00 p.m.-12:00 midnight on weekdays and 8:00 p.m.-2:00am on weekends.\n\nIn 1978 KBSC changed to a 24-hour schedule, running ONTV from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. daily. From 6:00 a.m. to noon the station broadcast public affairs and religious programs, with general-entertainment programming initially retained from noon to the start of ONTV programming in the evening. In summer 1979, KBSC sold its entertainment-programming inventory to KTLA. The station broadcast religious programs from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. and ONTV after 6:00 p.m., with Spanish-language programming from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays and 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays. English-language religious programming was carried on Sundays from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.\n\nIn 1980 KBSC expanded its Spanish programming from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays and 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on weekends, with ONTV programming filling the rest of the day. In 1982, the station began carrying ONTV on a scrambled signal 24 hours a day.\n\nIn September 1985 KBSC was sold to Miami-based NetSpan, which became Telemundo in 1987. It was the first mainland U.S. station owned by Telemundo at the network's beginning. ONTV was dropped, and the station's call letters were changed to KVEA; KBSC callsign was later used for low-powered station in Brookings, Oregon. The call letters represent the Spanish phrase \"Que vea\", meaning \"You should see\".\n\nNBC purchased Telemundo in 2001, creating a triopoly with NBC-owned-and-operated KNBC and Spanish-language independent KWHY (channel 22; that station was later sold in 2011). Los Angeles and San Francisco are the only markets where a company can legally own three stations, due to Federal Communications Commission rules permitting ownership of more than two stations in markets with a minimum of 20 full-power television stations. KVEA's news, promotion and senior-management operations moved to NBC's Burbank studios. In spring 2014, the station's news department moved to Universal Studios Hollywood, where it shares a new broadcast facility with KNBC.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn December 5, 2010, KVEA began mobile DTV broadcasts. It operates a mobile DTV feed of subchannel 52.1, broadcasting at 1.83 Mbit/s.\n\nKVEA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 52, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 39, using PSIP to display its virtual channel as 52 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nKVEA presently broadcasts 19 hours and 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts weekly: three hours and 35 minutes each weekday and one hour each Saturday and Sunday. The station also produces a news magazine, \"Acceso Total\" (broadcast weekday mornings at 10 a.m.), and the public-affairs program \"Enfoque Los Ángeles\" (a local version of the Telemundo discussion program \"Enfoque\", broadcast Sundays at noon).\n\nThe station's news department, which had initially broadcast at 6 and 11 p.m. weekdays after its acquisition by Telemundo, expanded on January 15, 2001 to compete with Spanish-language news station KMEX. A weekday news program from 6 to 7 a.m., \"Buenos Días Los Angeles\", accompanied the two evening newscasts and new anchors and reporters were introduced.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, KVEA expanded \"Buenos Días\" to two hours, starting at 5 a.m. The morning newscasts were anchored by Mexican native Azalea Iniguez, Mexican journalist and former CBS Telenoticias reporter Ruben Luengas and weather anchor-feature reporter Sal Morales (who joined KVEA from its San Francisco sister station KSTS and was a substitute anchor for Luengas). California Highway Patrol officer Guillermo Preciado later joined the newscasts as a traffic reporter. The news team's lineup introduced the idea of \"familia unida\" (a united family) implemented by news director Al Corral, who based the concept on his belief that Hispanics are loyal to what they know and shy away from news from other sources. Ratings improved, and \"Buenos Días\" competed with KMEX's morning newscast \"Primera Edicion\". Iniguez was later moved to an anchor position on \"Buenos Días\".\n\nKVEA then introduced \"Noticiero 52\" with graphics, music, and an anchor team: Lucia Navarro (from Houston sister station KTMD), Tijuana reporter Vicente Calderon and Mario Solis. Solis left after a disagreement with station management, and was replaced by Mauricio Cardenas. Calderon was transferred to the newly acquired independent station KWHY-TV (channel 22) to anchor its 10 p.m. newscast with Pilar Gariboto. Navarro was joined by former Telemundo and Telenoticias anchor Raul Peimbert, who later left the station for a government position in his native Mexico. Ratings fell due to personnel changes, and longtime Univision anchor Eduardo Quezada joined Navarro at 6 and 11 p.m. In early 2006, Navarro and Quezada were moved from the 11 p.m. newscast to a new program anchored by Luengas.\n\nThe station introduced weekend evening newscasts anchored by former weeknight anchor Mirthala Salinas, former TV Azteca anchor Eduardo Blancas and weather anchor Carolina Davalos. Salinas was eventually replaced by Azucena Gomez, and Blancas was replaced by former KTLA weekend sports anchor Claudia Trejos. Trejos later moved to Telemundo's news division in Hialeah, Florida.\n\nIn 2006 Eduardo Quezada left KVEA and the station renamed its 11 p.m. newscast \"En Contexto,\" anchored by Luengas. The format change was successful, with the program winning several journalism awards. Sports announcer and former KVEA weekend sports anchor Adrian Garcia Marquez replaced Luengas on \"Buenos Días\", joining Iniguez, entertainment reporter Victor Cordero and weather anchor Ericka Pino. Morales had left the station and went back to his hometown, Miami, to work as a full-time reporter for WSBS-22, known as Mega TV. After this lineup was put in place in summer 2007, the program's ratings fell, and KMEX was back on top.\n\nAlso in 2006, NBC's 2.0 restructuring plan for its broadcast properties resulted in across-the-board layoffs, including reporter Osmin Rodriguez and KWHY anchor Vicente Calderon; Jose Ronstadt became the news anchor. On July 3, 2007, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa admitted to the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" that he had been having an extramarital affair with KVEA reporter Mirthala Salinas. Telemundo's Miami management replaced station general manager Manuel Abud with interim GM Mike Rodriguez, general manager of Miami sister station WSCV. News director Al Corral and Salinas were given two-month leaves of absence, and Rodriguez made it clear that he would not be taking the job permanently.\n\nOn September 15, 2007, KVEA became the second Spanish-language television station in the United States (after Reno-based CW affiliate KAZR-CA) and the sixth television station in the Los Angeles market to broadcast its local newscasts (\"Buenos Días Los Angeles\") in high definition. In 2009, \"Buenos Días\" was cancelled due to difficulties with NBC. Its anchors became reporters, and were joined by former KWHY anchor Dunia Elvir (who had presented morning updates during \"¡Levántate!\", now known as \"Un Nuevo Día\"). Although the morning show and Elvir's 1 p.m. program on KWHY were cancelled, NBCUniversal's acquisition by Comcast that year resulted in the return of \"Buenos Días\" in 2011. In 2014, the program moved to 5 a.m.\n\nThe 2014 Telemundo revamp included more changes to the news team, a new studio, a new network-wide graphics package, and a network-wide time change for the weekend newscast (from 6 to 5:30 p.m.). The station's news department refocused on the two evening newscasts, which included investigative reporting of a wide range of stories. Most anchors again became reporters, and Edgar Muñoz joined previous chief anchor Ana Patricia Candiani. \"Buenos Días Los Angeles\" added Julio Vaqueiro and Estefanía Iglesias to its team, expanding to 5 a.m. with sister station WNJU-TV. In February 2014, Denny Alfonso became the investigative and consumer reporter on its \"Telemundo 52 Responde\" segment. On September 18, 2014, Telemundo announced that its 14 local stations would carry a 5:30 p.m. weekday newscast. On September 25, its 11 p.m. newscast outdrew rival KMEX-TV in ratings for the first time in 27 years.\nOn February 22, 2018, The network began producing and broadcasting news. Miami, New York and Los Angeles and other owned and operated television stations, joined this effort producing more newscasts those some of their rivals in markets in Spanish.\n\n\n"}

She possessed a sweet-toned, lyrical voice and was a brilliant exponent of florid singing. \n\nSontag was born at Koblenz, Germany, as Gertrude Walpurgis Sontag, to the actor Franz Sontag and his wife, the actress Franziska Sontag (\"née\" Martloff, 1798–1865). Her brother was the actor Karl Sontag. She made her début at the age of 6. In 1823 she sang at Leipzig in Carl Maria von Weber's \"Der Freischütz\" and in December of that year created the title role in his \"Euryanthe\". Her success was immediate. She was invited to be the soprano soloist in the first performances of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and \"Missa Solemnis\" on 7 May 1824; she was only 18 years old at the time. In 1825 she was engaged by the , Berlin. \n\nIn 1826, she was engaged at the Paris Comédie-Italienne, where she debuted in the role of Rosina in Gioacchino Rossini's opera \"The Barber of Seville\". She was also extremely successful in performance in England and Germany in the following years. When she visited Weimar, Goethe wrote a poem dedicated to her (\"Neue Siren\"). Around 1829 she married Count Carlo Rossi in secret, after which she left the stage until her husband's financial situation deteriorated.\n\nIn 1849 she was encouraged by the impresario Benjamin Lumley to perform a season at Covent Garden Theatre. She proved to have fully retained her vocal powers. In 1852 she toured America, and in 1854 performed in Mexico. A day after singing in \"Lucia di Lamermoor\", she contracted cholera, of which she died.\n\nSontag is buried in Germany at St. Marienthal Abbey. Her sister Nina Sontag (1811–1879), originally also an opera-singer, had retired there as a nun in 1844.\n\nHector Berlioz wrote of Sontag:\n"}
{"id": "1916416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916416", "title": "Deep Purple (album)", "text": "Deep Purple (album)\n\nDeep Purple, also referred to as Deep Purple III, is the third studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple, released in June 1969 on Tetragrammaton Records in the United States and only in September 1969 on Harvest Records in the United Kingdom. Its release was preceded by the single \"Emmaretta\" and by a long tour in the UK, whose dates were interspersed between the album's recording sessions.\n\nThe music of this album is mostly original and a combination of progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but with a harder edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence than in the past. This was due both to the growth of guitarist Ritchie Blackmore as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion of classical music and rock proposed by keyboard player Jon Lord and amply implemented in the band's previous releases.\n\nThe band started their second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, because of a delay in the manufacturing of the new LP. During the tour, Deep Purple showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist Rod Evans with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in Ian Gillan of the band Episode Six. Gillan had formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist Roger Glover, who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replace Nick Simper. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969.\n\nCommercially, this album was the least successful of the three albums released by the band's Mark I line-up and was ignored by critics upon its release. Modern reviews are generally positive and remark on the variety of styles within the album and the boldness of the song arrangements.\n\nIn late 1968, Deep Purple had embarked on a successful first US tour to promote their second album, \"The Book of Taliesyn\", and returned home on 3 January 1969. The band was considered an underground act in the United Kingdom, but word of their success in America had influenced their reputation at home, as they gradually rose in popularity and request. However, their releases had yet to make an impact in the UK, where their second single, a cover of Neil Diamond's \"Kentucky Woman\", had not charted and was retired after six weeks, after having peaked at No. 38 in the United States and No. 21 in Canada.\n\nDeep Purple's American label Tetragrammaton Records pressured the band to make a single to match the success of their hit \"Hush\", and the band had tried to satisfy that request while still in the US for the last dates of their tour; they recorded some covers in a New York studio in December 1968, without worthwhile results. The musicians had come up with much more complex original material for their second album and making a song that would easily fit the three-minute range was apparently becoming difficult.\n\nA few days after their US tour, Deep Purple settled in with their usual producer Derek Lawrence at De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, already used for \"The Book of Taliesyn\" sessions, to compose and record new songs and solve the new single problem. The song \"Emmaretta\", named after the musical \"Hair\" cast member Emmaretta Marks whom singer Rod Evans had met in the US, was composed for that purpose and recorded on 7 January 1969, after four takes. The heavier and more experimental song \"The Bird Has Flown\" was arranged and recorded later on the same day and was chosen as the B-side for the US release. The instrumental \"Wring That Neck\" from their previous album was the B-side of the British edition of \"Emmaretta\", which was issued in February 1969 and promoted by Deep Purple in their first full UK tour. This was the first time that a Deep Purple release appeared in the UK before the US. The tour started in Birmingham on 6 February with a concert broadcast by BBC Radio 1, and went on as a series of one-nighters in clubs and colleges across the country during February and March. Deep Purple's greater visibility and their declared interest in the British public induced local music magazines to print a few articles on them. But after keyboard player and spokesperson Jon Lord publicly stated that they would play large arenas for £2500 per show in America then come home and only be able to book small venues paying £150 a night, typical headlines were \"Purple won't starve for an ideal\" and \"They lose £2350 a night working in Britain\".\n\nThe band's management organized the spare time from the UK tour to record new songs for a third album over the course of February and March 1969 at De Lane Lea Studios, with Lawrence as producer and Barry Ainsworth as sound engineer. The pressure of the multiple engagements left the band very little time for composition and most of the tracks were written and rehearsed in the studio. \"Deep Purple\" was the band's third album to be recorded, even though they had been together for less than one year. According to Nick Simper: \"Recording was always a problem. We were always short of material, purely because of our schedule. The fact that we were always being chased by Tetragrammaton for material, we never had the luxury like most bands do now of saying, 'hang on fellas, we need a little bit of down time to just think about stuff and try and be creative.'\" Added Blackmore: \"That really bugs me...going to the studio, 'right, you gotta turn out an LP, boys.' You know, 'here we go, you gotta write a song...\"today\".' It’s just ridiculous.\"\n\nThe musicians were now starting to fully endeavour to write original material and found ideas for seven songs, more than on either of their first two albums. Musical and lyrical inspiration came from very disparate sources. The opener \"Chasing Shadows\" was based upon African rhythms created by drummer Ian Paice. The dour and baroque \"Blind\" was written by Lord about one of his nightmares. The short instrumental \"Fault Line\" was inspired by an earthquake that the band had experienced while in Los Angeles and featured Paice's drum patterns reversed and double tracked. Roman Polanski's movie \"Rosemary's Baby\", which the band members had watched together at a cinema, was the main inspiration for the blues rocker \"Why Didn't Rosemary?\" \"April\" was a tune written by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore about his birthday month before the recording sessions had begun; it was later augmented with a long middle section of classical music written by Lord, becoming the album's 12-minute-plus final track and Deep Purple's longest ever studio recording. The only cover song on the album is the Donovan-penned ballad \"Lalena\", which had been a Top 40 single for its author in the US in the autumn of 1968.\n\nThe first new song to be publicly performed was titled \"Hey Bop a Re Bop\", which aired on the \"Top Gear\" radio show on 14 January 1969. It was broadcast again on 11 February before being reworked and becoming the psychedelic blues song \"The Painter\".\n\nAlthough most recording dates are lost, it is known that the band recorded two songs on 17 February. \"Lalena\" and most of \"April\" were recorded on 28 February, while a new version of \"The Bird Has Flown\", retitled \"Bird Has Flown\", was put on tape on 28 March. The orchestral part of \"April\" played by hired musicians was the last recording for the yet-unnamed album, which was mixed and delivered by the end of March.\n\nAs is the case with most of the material on their previous two albums, the songs of \"Deep Purple\" mix elements of progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but this time in a darker and more baroque atmosphere. Perhaps in response to British audiences craving more blues-based rock, the band also incorporated a 12-bar blues structure on the songs \"The Painter\" and \"Why Didn't Rosemary?\" \"Emmaretta\" is a pop rock song written to be a commercial single, but the sound of the album is heavier and more guitar-oriented than previous works, similar to how the band sounded live during this period.\nLord had been the main writer on the first two albums and his classical music upbringing and interest in fusing classical and rock had profoundly influenced the direction taken by the band. Blackmore compared the organ-heavy mix of those releases to the works of the British progressive rock band The Nice, featuring Keith Emerson on keyboards. On \"Deep Purple\" Lord still had a great influence, which found maximum expression in the harpsicord-flavoured \"Blind\" and in the orchestral section of \"April\", an original piece for choir and string quartet that he composed despite being hard at work in writing and arranging his \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\". Lord's dominance waned some in this release as more writing and performing space was given to Blackmore, who delivered his longest and, for some critics, best guitar solos to date. Critics also remark Paice's progress as performer especially on the \"tribal\" opening track \"Chasing Shadows\", where he had his first chance at songwriting. Bass player Nick Simper later stated that \"there was a lot of pressure from Jon Lord to do this kind of semi-classical stuff [and] we didn't actually rebel against it until the third album.\"\n\nPsychedelic rock had been another main influence in the first two Deep Purple albums, but it was rapidly going out of fashion; the musicians ceased their exploration of the genre in this album with songs such as \"The Painter\" and \"Bird Has Flown\", dedicating themselves completely to the trendier hard rock genre in the following studio releases.\n\nTetragrammaton issued the album in a stark gatefold sleeve, wrapped around with a segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\". The label ran into difficulty over the use of the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut \"One Nation Underground\".\n\nTetragrammaton Records had been active only for a year, but was on the brink of bankruptcy in the US. Its initial solid financial foundation had been quickly eroded by expensive promotional campaigns and by failed commercial strategies. Deep Purple were the label's most successful artist, but the band had not been able to produce another hit single like \"Hush\" and their latest release \"Emmaretta\", out just in time for their second US tour in April 1969, was also largely unsuccessful and failed to affect the US charts. The label's financial distress caused a delay in the printing of \"Deep Purple\", which was released in the US only on 21 June 1969, after the band had returned home having completed their US tour.\n\nIn the UK, \"Lalena\" and \"The Painter\" were performed live on 24 June 1969 at a BBC Radio session. The album was released in the UK in September 1969 on EMI's sub-label Harvest Records, at the same time as the much-hyped event \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. At that time Deep Purple's line-up had already changed.\n\n\"Deep Purple\" was reissued very few times and only in Europe, often in a set with the two other albums recorded by the Mark I line-up. The only other international reissue of the album is the Remastered 2000 CD edition by EMI, which contains versions of \"The Bird Has Flown\", \"Emmaretta \" and live performances taken from BBC Radio sessions as bonus tracks. All the songs were digitally remastered by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London.\n\nWhile the band was recording the new album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for Deep Purple to support the Rolling Stones in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided to spend more time at Olympic Studios in London to record their album \"Let It Bleed\" and postponed their tour. Thus, in early April 1969 Deep Purple were on their way back to the US to start off a two-month coast-to-coast tour as headliners which, similarly to what had happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges. This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by Polydor Records.\n\nUpon arrival on US soil, Deep Purple found out that Tetragrammaton had not yet found the resources to manufacture their now finished album and could offer very little financial support to the tour. Contrary to what happened in the past, when the American label had spent much money in advance for promotion and people who saw the band on the road could find stacks of LPs and singles for sale at every concert, this time the single \"Emmaretta\" and the band's back-catalogue remained sitting on store shelves. In fact, the band experienced some economic limitations during the tour and asked their manager John Coletta to fly back home, so the hotel bills would be reduced. Coletta later commented on how 1969 was a wasted year for Deep Purple in America.\n\nEven though their most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple maintained a reputation as a fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.\n\nDespite having turned into a highly proficient band on stage, things were starting to heat up internally, with band members getting more vocal about the direction they wanted the music to go, as well as being dissatisfied with their treatment financially. Founding members Lord and Blackmore were tired of being identified as a \"clone of Vanilla Fudge\" and were starting to yearn for a sharper, rawer and overall heavier sound, similar to that introduced in Led Zeppelin's debut album, which had become a great success on both sides of the Atlantic, after its release in January 1969. They felt that Rod Evans, with his tender, smooth voice, would not be able to cope with louder, more aggressive material. Evans had also expressed reservations about his permanence in the band and voiced his wish to permanently move to the US. Tensions were also high with bassist Nick Simper, whose playing style was considered, in Paice's words, \"stuck in the late '50s and early '60s\" by the other band members and unfit for the new musical direction they wanted to pursue. On the other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music getting in the way of harder rock. As a result of those tensions, communication between band members was at a minimum during the tour. It was in May that Lord and Blackmore agreed on changing the line-up, shifting out Evans. They talked their ideas over with drummer Paice, gaining his agreement to the line-up change. Coletta was surprised when he heard the trio's news, advising them to keep quiet about it until the tour was completed and they had returned home.\n\nBack in England in early June, the decision taken had to be kept secret until the promotional tour for the British release of \"The Book of Taliesyn\" was completed. Meanwhile, the search for a new singer to replace Evans began and Blackmore asked for help in this task from his old acquaintance Mick Underwood, at the time drummer of the British rock band Episode Six. Underwood recommended Episode Six singer Ian Gillan, whom Blackmore and Lord contacted at a London gig. Gillan, who did not see a future in his then current band, was enthusiastic about joining Deep Purple and involved bassist Roger Glover, with whom he formed a songwriting duo. According to Simper, his replacement with Glover was initially not planned and was due to the creative togetherness of the two Episode Six members. Gillan convinced the reluctant Glover to audition for Deep Purple and the two soon found themselves torn between the new band, which gladly welcomed both of them, and obligations with Episode Six for the completion of a UK tour. Evans, Simper and Episode Six's management were kept unaware of these events and of the fact that the new line-up was already active in writing and rehearsing new songs. In between gigs all over the country, Deep Purple had rehearsed the song \"Hallelujah\" with Evans and Simper to be released as a new single, but it was recorded in secret on 7 June by the fresh Mark II line-up at De Lane Studios instead, with Glover still acting as a session musician. The final show of the Mark I lineup was in Cardiff on 4 July 1969, and the Mark II lineup debuted live at The Speakeasy Club in London on 10 July. The final show played by Gillan and Glover with Episode Six was in Little Bardfield on 26 July 1969. The single \"Hallelujah\" was released in late July in the US and the UK and featured an edited version of \"April\" as B-side, the final original appearance on vinyl of the Mark I formation.\n\nAfter his dismissal, Evans left for the US with his wife and resurfaced in 1971 as lead singer in the American prog rock band Captain Beyond. Simper sued Deep Purple's management for breaking his contract and the dispute was settled economically out of court. He later formed the rock band Warhorse.\n\nThe music of the album \"Deep Purple\" was played only during the tours of 1969 and never performed again by other line-ups, though Simper played songs from the first three Deep Purple albums with the tribute band Nasty Habits in Europe in 2010.\n\n\"Deep Purple\" was practically ignored by the music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced up and down on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.\n\nIn the UK, the single \"Emmaretta\" did not convince critics and buying public and failed to chart. At the time of release, \"Deep Purple\" was generally ignored by the British music press, more focused on the eventful \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" than on an album by an extinct line-up. The album was a slow seller in Europe and eventually was certified Gold in Germany in 1990.\n\nModern reviews are generally positive. AllMusic's Bruce Eder calls the album \"one of the most bracing progressive rock albums ever, and a successful vision of a musical path that the group might have taken but didn't\", remarking how Deep Purple succeeded in combining \"heavy metal's early, raw excitement, intensity, and boldness with progressive rock's complexity and intellectual scope.\" Jedd Beaudoin of PopMatters appreciates in his review the heavier sound of the songs and notices how \"Evans sounds more and more out of place in a band that was increasingly more comfortable with stretching itself beyond the confines of pure pop pieces\", like in the track \"April\", which he considers not only \"the most ambitious thing on the entire record, but also arguably the best.\" David Bowling, in his Blogcritics column, reviews the album as \"the least satisfying of their three early career releases, although it can also be considered their most adventurous\" for its \"meandering through a number of different styles and sounds.\" However, considering the growth shown by Blackmore and Lord as performers in this release, he concludes that it is \"a fitting conclusion to the band's formative years.\" Martin Popoff praised the album for being \"stronger, more aggressive and much better recorded\" than \"either of the first two records\", showing the original work of \"a strangely soulful psych band distinguished\", with the exception of singer Evans, \"by its hard-hitting players\".\n\nAll credits adapted from the original releases.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916420", "title": "The Three Graces (sculpture)", "text": "The Three Graces (sculpture)\n\nAntonio Canova’s statue The Three Graces is a Neoclassical sculpture, in marble, of the mythological three charites, daughters of Zeus — identified on some engravings of the statue as, from left to right, Euphrosyne, Aglaea and Thalia — who were said to represent youth/beauty (Thalia), mirth (Euphrosyne), and elegance (Aglaea). The Graces presided over banquets and gatherings, to delight the guests of the gods. As such they have served as subjects for historical artists including Sandro Botticelli and Bertel Thorvaldsen.\n\nA version of the sculpture is in the Hermitage Museum, and another is owned jointly and exhibited in turn by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Scottish National Gallery.\n\nJohn Russell, the 6th Duke of Bedford, commissioned a version of the now famous work. He had visited Canova's studio in Rome in 1814 and had been immensely impressed by a carving of the Graces which Canova produced for the Empress Josephine. When the Empress died in May of the same year he offered to purchase the completed piece, but was unsuccessful as Josephine's son Eugène claimed it (his son Maximilian brought it to St. Petersburg, where it can now be found in the Hermitage Museum). Undeterred, the Duke commissioned another version for himself.\n\nThe sculpting process began in 1814 and was completed in 1817. In 1819 it was installed at the Duke's residence in Woburn Abbey. Canova traveled to England to supervise its installation, choosing to display it on a pedestal adapted from a marble plinth with a rotating top. This item is now owned jointly by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland, and is alternately displayed at each.\n\nThe version in the Hermitage is carved from veined marble and has a square pillar behind the left-hand figure (Euphrosyne). The Woburn Abbey version is carved from white marble and has a round pillar, and the central figure (Aglaea) has a slightly broader waist.\n\nBy the time he received the Duke's commission, Canova had already enjoyed an illustrious sculpting career. Born in the Italian province of Treviso in 1757, he was educated by his grandfather and his artistic talent was quickly noticed, especially by a senator, Giovanni Falieri, who introduced him to the sculptor Torretto. Torretto took Canova as apprentice for two years.\nCanova went on to enjoy small commissions, but his fame did not come until 1780 when he traveled to Rome and found himself inspired and invigorated by the scope and quality of the art and architecture. During this time Canova produced some of his most revered works including: \"Theseus and the Minotaur\" (1782), his monument to Pope Clement XIV (now displayed in the basilica dei Santi Apostoli) and the masterminding of the sumptuous tomb of Clement XIII in St. Peter's. In 1793 he produced \"Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss\", a piece of immaculate composition and flowing beauty.\n\nIn 1802, he was called to Paris by Napoleon I to model an enormous figure of the emperor clutching a ‘Victory’ in his hand. He would also model a bust of the French leader as well as a statue of Napoleon's mother. The fact that these pieces represented only a fraction of his works during this period make his dual commissions to sculpt the Graces understandable.\n\nThe sculpture for the Duke of Bedford was based on depictions of the Graces which Canova had previously made, including a 1799 painting, other drawings, and a relief of the Graces that he executed around the same time.\n\nIn 1810, he modelled a terracotta sketch (now in the Musée de Lyon, France). But it is likely that his piece for the Empress Josephine and later the Duke was modelled mainly on the early drawings and a terracotta sketch model. We know that the immediate model for the work was a full-scale plaster group that has survived and is now in the Canova museum in Possagno. In the Duke of Bedford version, the graces are leaning on a pillar, though in earlier versions this feature was absent.\n\nThe piece is carved from a single slab of white marble. Canova's assistants roughly blocked out the marble, leaving Canova to perform the final carving and shape the stone to highlight the Graces’ soft flesh. This was a trademark of the artist, and the piece shows a strong allegiance to the Neo-Classical movement in sculpture, of which Canova is the prime exponent.\n\nThe three goddesses are shown nude, huddled together, their heads almost touching in what many have referred to as an ‘erotically charged’ piece. They stand, leaning slightly inward — perhaps discussing a common issue, or simply enjoying their closeness. Their hair-styles are similar, braided and held atop their heads in a knot.\n\nThe style is elegant and suggests refinement and class — there is a delicate beauty to them that is commonplace in Canova's sculpture. Art historians have often commented on the peaceful balance that seems to exist between the three heads. Unlike compositions of the Graces that were derived from antiquity, where the outer figures turn out towards the viewer and the central figure embraces her friends with her back to the viewer, Canova's figures stand side by side, facing each other.\n\nThe three slender female figures become one in their embrace, united by their linked hands and by a scarf which links them. The unity of the Graces is one of the piece's main themes. In Countess Josephine's version, the Graces are on a sacrificial altar adorned with three wreaths of flowers and a garland symbolizing their fragile, close ties.\n\nCanova's work challenged the baroque conception of opulent beauty; he shows the Graces as nubile, svelte young women. This is not the only departure that Canova's work makes from the Baroque. For example, The Baroque works of Italian sculptor Bernini presents a stark moment in time — a snapshot. Bernini's 1644 work \"The Ecstasy of St. Theresa\" shows the moment at which the holy spirit pierces Theresa's heart, leaving her in what can only be described as ecstasy of divine presence. It is a dramatic, poignant scene captured by Bernini at the moment of greatest impact. Canova's work, however, is different. His pieces do not seem to possess any real sense of time, they merely exist at a point in the past — almost ghostly reminders of a mythological happening or person long deceased. In the case of the Graces he dispenses with theatrics and invites the viewer to make what they will of the scene. This is typical of the Neoclassical movement. In many respects this work was a departure and has since become regarded by many as a benchmark of beauty.\n\n"}

He opposed Richelieu, and conspired with the count of Soissons, fighting in the Battle of La Marfée in 1641. For this, he was condemned to death, but fled to Brussels in 1641. His property was seized by the king in 1641, for crime of lèse majesté. Reprieved, he returned in 1643 and his confiscated property was returned to him.\n\nHoping to make good his family's ancient pretensions to the Kingdom of Naples, he joined the revolt of Masaniello in 1647. The \"Royal Republic of Naples\" was declared, appealing to the protection of France and nominally headed by Guise (entitled doge in imitation of Venice). However, the tactless Guise rapidly alienated the Neapolitans, and wielded little influence with Cardinal Mazarin. He was captured by the Spaniards in 1648 when the republic fell, and held by them until 1652. He made a second attack on Naples in 1654, but it ended in failure, partly because of the presence of an English fleet under Robert Blake in support of the Spanish.\n\nAfterwards, he settled in Paris, becoming Grand Chamberlain of France to Louis XIV and going deeply into debt because of his expenditures for horses and entertainments. He was the patron of Pierre Corneille, to whom he gave a lodging in the Hôtel de Guise.\n\nOver the years two women laid claim to being his wife. The first was Anna Gonzaga later known as the \"Princess Palatine,\" who in 1639 appears to have been duped into believing that a clandestine marriage ceremony was genuine. The second was a widow, Honorée de Berghes, Countess of Bossut, who claimed to have married him in Brussels on November 11, 1641. In March 1666 the Sacra Rota declared the marriage valid; but the King (and the House of Guise) refused to recognize the decision, thereby preventing Mme de Bossut from receiving any of the late Duke's vast fortune.\n\nAnna Gonzaga described Duke Henry's \"good and bad qualities\" as follows:\nMonsieur Guise had the figure, the air and the manners of a hero in a novel, and his entire life bore the mark this character. Magnificence reigned in his entire person and in everything that surrounded him; his conversation was especially charming: everything he said, everything he did, proclaimed that he was an extraordinary man. Ambition and love dominated his projects, which were so vast that they were Homeric; but with such an illustrious name, heroic valor, and a bit of good fortune, nothing exceeded his hopes. He had a gift for making himself loved by all those he wanted to please, which seemed to be the lot of the princes of the House of Lorraine. He was flighty in his attachments, inconstant in his projects, hasty in carrying things out.\nHe was succeeded by his nephew Louis Joseph de Lorraine.\n\n"}

Woody came to Cheers at the beginning of the fourth season of \"Cheers\" in 1985 in the episode \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\".\n\nWoody appeared in 200 episodes of \"Cheers\" between 1985 and 1993. He also made a guest appearance on \"Frasier\" in the episode \"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\". He is portrayed as simple-minded but good-hearted.\n\nWoody was born on July 23 (like the actor who played him) and hails from Hanover, Indiana, where he was voted the smartest student in school. His mother's name was Margaret and his father's name is Edgel.\n\nHe and his childhood sweetheart, Beth Curtis, were also voted \"Couple Most Likely to Explode,\" as they were both obese at the time. It was later revealed that they always ate, to excess, around one another due to their palpable sexual tension.\n\nWoody followed in Coach's footsteps in many ways, failing to understand the most obvious jokes, concepts, and situations. Woody was essentially a straight man for all of the other characters at Cheers, though his humor stemmed from his misunderstandings.\n\nWoody seemed to have an off-center mentality, misunderstanding others' comments much as Coach had done. For example, when Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers appears and starts singing \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling,\" Woody asks him, \"How come you changed your name from Righteous?\" With the exception of Carla, Eddie, and Sam, Woody always addresses other characters by their honorific. Sometimes this leads to awkward phrasing such as referring to Lilith as Mrs. Dr. Sternin-Crane.\n\nWoody arrived at Cheers expecting to meet his \"pen pal\" Coach, with whom he exchanged pens instead of letters. Upon learning of Coach's death, he filled the open bartender position, and was quickly accepted by the staff and regulars. He also developed a \"big brother/little brother\" relationship with Sam Malone, the owner of Cheers. In the coming years, he filled the void left by Coach and eventually married the wealthy Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), overcoming her father's objections to Woody's lowly station in life as well as conflicting religious views: he's Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, she's \"Evangelical Lutheran Church of America\" (The episode uses \"of\" but the denomination is \"in America\").\n\nIn the final season, Frasier Crane orchestrated an experiment that went awry and resulted in Woody's election to the Boston City Council. He and Kelly were expecting their first child when \"Cheers\" ended. Frasier extrapolates on Woody's interest in a political career to the point that Woody becomes President of the United States and shows his displeasure with another country by using \"The Bomb\" (illustrated twice in Frasier's imagination as a mushroom cloud).\n\nWoody Harrelson reprised his role in the 1990 Walt Disney anthology television series episode \"Disneyland 35th Anniversary Celebration\", where his young self in a flashback is played by Branden Maciel. The character also appeared on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Fear of Flying\".\n\nWoody makes a guest appearance on \"Frasier\", the spin-off show from \"Cheers\", in the season 6 episode \"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\". During a visit to Seattle he reconnects with Frasier Crane, who had since moved there from Boston. After a one-night reunion, the two begin to spend a great deal of time with each other – which gradually turns into an ordeal for both, as they quickly realize they have moved on from their past and settled into new lives, with neither man seeing the other's life as being particularly fulfilling. The two men decide to part company on good terms, after sharing a final drink with each other, leading Woody to utter his final line: \"Cheers\".\n\nAlthough this is Woody's only appearance on the show, he is referenced both prior to and after this. When Sam visits Frasier in the season 2 episode, \"The Show Where Sam Comes Back\", he reveals that Kelly and Woody's first child was a boy, who is of normal intelligence. In the season 9 episode \"Cheerful Goodbyes,\" Frasier reveals that at his going-away party at Cheers before returning to Seattle, Woody grabbed onto his legs and begged him not to go. Woody's political career was not mentioned in \"Frasier\"; he states at the beginning of the season 6 episode \"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\" that he is still tending bar at Cheers.\n\n"}

{"id": "1916444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916444", "title": "Special Report on Emissions Scenarios", "text": "Special Report on Emissions Scenarios\n\nThe Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) is a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that was published in 2000. The greenhouse gas emissions scenarios described in the Report have been used to make projections of possible future climate change. The SRES scenarios, as they are often called, were used in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), published in 2001, and in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), published in 2007.\n\nThe SRES scenarios were designed to improve upon some aspects of the IS92 scenarios, which had been used in the earlier IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995. The SRES scenarios are \"baseline\" (or \"reference\") scenarios, which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).\n\nEmissions projections of the SRES scenarios are broadly comparable in range to the baseline emissions scenarios that have been developed by the scientific community. The SRES scenarios, however, do not encompass the full range of possible futures: emissions may change less than the scenarios imply, or they could change more.\n\nSRES was superseded by the Shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) in preparation for the 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report.\n\nBecause projections of climate change depend heavily upon future human activity, climate models are run against scenarios. There are 40 different scenarios, each making different assumptions for future greenhouse gas pollution, land-use and other driving forces. Assumptions about future technological development as well as the future economic development are thus made for each scenario. Most include an increase in the consumption of fossil fuels; some versions of B1 have lower levels of consumption by 2100 than in 1990. Overall global GDP will grow by a factor of between 5-25 in the emissions scenarios.\n\nThese emissions scenarios are organized into families, which contain scenarios that are similar to each other in some respects. IPCC assessment report projections for the future are often made in the context of a specific scenario family.\n\nAccording to the IPCC, all SRES scenarios are considered \"neutral\". None of the SRES scenarios project future disasters or catastrophes, e.g., wars and conflicts, and/or environmental collapse.\n\nThe scenarios are not described by the IPCC as representing good or bad pathways of future social and economic development.\n\nScenario families contain individual scenarios with common themes. The six families of scenarios discussed in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR) and Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) are A1FI, A1B, A1T, A2, B1, and B2.\n\nThe IPCC did not state that any of the SRES scenarios were more likely to occur than others, therefore none of the SRES scenarios represent a \"best guess\" of future emissions.\n\nScenario descriptions are based on those in AR4, which are identical to those in TAR.\n\nThe A1 scenarios are of a more integrated world. The A1 family of scenarios is characterized by:\n\nThere are subsets to the A1 family based on their technological emphasis:\n\nThe A2 scenarios are of a more divided world. The A2 family of scenarios is characterized by:\n\nThe B1 scenarios are of a world more integrated, and more ecologically friendly. The B1 scenarios are characterized by:\n\nThe B2 scenarios are of a world more divided, but more ecologically friendly. The B2 scenarios are characterized by:\n\nWhile some scenarios assume a more environmentally friendly world than others, none include any climate-specific initiatives, such as the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe SRES scenarios have been used to project future atmospheric GHG concentrations. Under the six illustrative SRES scenarios, the IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) projects the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide () in the year 2100 as between 540 and 970 parts per million (ppm). In this estimate, there are uncertainties over the future removal of carbon from the atmosphere by carbon sinks. There are also uncertainties regarding future changes in the Earth's biosphere and feedbacks in the climate system. The estimated effect of these uncertainties mean that the total projected concentration ranges from 490 to 1,260 ppm. This compares to a pre-industrial (taken as the year 1750) concentration of about 280 ppm, and a concentration of about 368 ppm in the year 2000.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has also produced projections of future atmospheric GHG concentrations using the SRES scenarios. These projections are shown opposite, and are subject to the uncertainty described earlier regarding the future role of carbon sinks and changes to the Earth's biosphere.\n\nBetween the 1990s and 2000s, the growth rate in CO emissions from fossil fuel burning and industrial processes increased (McMullen and Jabbour, 2009, p. 8). The growth rate from 1990-1999 averaged 1.1% per year.\n\nBetween the years 2000-2009, growth in emissions from fossil fuel burning was, on average, 3% per year, which exceeds the growth estimated by 35 of the 40 SRES scenarios (34 if the trend is computed with end points instead of a linear fit). Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions set a record in 2010, a 6% jump on 2009 emissions, exceeding even the \"worst case\" scenario cited in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.\n\nThe SRES scenarios were criticised by Ian Castles and David Henderson. The core of their critique was the use of market exchange rates (MER) for international comparison, in lieu of the theoretically favoured PPP exchange rate which corrects for differences in purchasing power. The IPCC rebutted this criticism.\n\nThe positions in the debate can be summarised as follows. Using MER, the SRES scenarios overstate income differences in past and present, and overestimate future economic growth in developing countries. This, Castles and Henderson originally argued, leads to an overestimate of future greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC future climate change projections would have been overestimated.\n\nHowever, the difference in economic growth is offset by a difference in energy intensity. Some say these two opposite effects fully cancel, some say this is only partial. Overall, the effect of a switch from MER to PPP is likely to have a minimal effect on carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Castles and Henderson later accepted this and acknowledged that they were mistaken that future greenhouse gas emissions had been significantly overestimated.\n\nBut even though global climate change is not affected, it has been argued that the regional distribution of emissions and incomes is very different between an MER and a PPP scenario. This would influence the political debate: in a PPP scenario, China and India have a much smaller share of global emissions. It would also affect vulnerability to climate change: in a PPP scenario, poor countries grow more slowly and would face greater impacts.\n\nAs part of the SRES, IPCC authors assessed the potential future availability of fossil fuels for energy use. SRES assumptions about availability of fossil fuels is largely based on a 1997 study done by Rogner, who goes to great lengths to claim that there are enough fossil resources, i.e. hydrocarbon molecules in the crust, to theoretically sustain production for an extended period of time., \n\nThe issue of whether or not the future availability of fossil fuels would limit future carbon emissions was considered in the \"Third Assessment Report\"; it concluded that limits on fossil fuel resources would not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century. Their estimate for conventional coal reserves was around 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC), with an upper estimate of between 3,500 and 4,000 GtC. This compares with cumulative carbon emissions up to the year 2100 of about 1,000 GtC for the SRES B1 scenario, and about 2,000 GtC for the SRES A1FI scenario.\n\nThe carbon in proven conventional oil and gas reserves was estimated to be much less than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with atmospheric stabilization of CO concentrations at levels of 450 ppmv or higher. The \"Third Assessment Report\" suggested that the future makeup of the world's energy mix would determine whether or not greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilized in the 21st century. The future energy mix might be based more on the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas (e.g., oil sands, shale oil, tight oil, shale gas), or more on the use of non-fossil energy sources, like renewable energy. Total primary energy production from fossil fuels in the SRES outlooks range from a mere 50% increase from year 2010 in the B1 family to over 400% in the A1 family.\n\nDirect quote from abstract of Wang et al:\n\nThis persistent problem has been criticized for a long time as many assumptions used for fossil fuel availability and future production have been optimistic at best and implausible at worst. The SRES and RCP scenarios have been criticized for being biased towards “exaggerated resource availability” and making “unrealistic expectations on future production outputs from fossil fuels., . Energy cannot be seen as a limitless input to economic/climate models and remain disconnected from the physical and logistical realities of supply.\n\nA recent meta-analysis of the fossil energy outlooks used for climate change scenarios even identified a \"return to coal hypothesis\", as most mainstream climate scenarios foresee a significant increase in world coal production in the future. Patzek and Croft (2010, p. 3113) made a prediction of future coal production and carbon emissions. In their assessment, all but the lowest emission SRES scenarios projected far too high levels of future coal production and carbon emissions (Patzek and Croft, 2010, pp. 3113–3114). Similar results was reached by other long-term coal projections\n\nIn a discussion paper, Aleklett (2007, p. 17) viewed SRES projections between the years 2020 and 2100 as “absolutely unrealistic”. In Aleklett's analysis, emissions from oil and gas were lower than all of the SRES projections, with emissions from coal much lower than the majority of SRES projections (Aleklett, 2007, p. 2).\n\nIn 2005, the UK Parliament's House of Lords Economics Affairs Select Committee produced a report on the economics of climate change. As part of their inquiry, they took evidence on criticisms of the SRES. Among those who gave evidence to the Committee were Dr Ian Castles, a critic of the SRES scenarios, and Prof Nebojsa Nakicenovic, who co-edited the SRES. IPCC author Dr Chris Hope commented on the SRES A2 scenario, which is one of the higher emissions scenarios of the SRES. Hope assessed and compared the marginal damages of climate change using two versions of the A2 scenario. In one version of the A2 scenario, emissions were as the IPCC projected. In the other version of A2, Hope reduced the IPCC's projected emissions by a half (i.e., 50% of the original A2 scenario). In his integrated assessment model, both of these versions of the A2 scenario lead to almost identical estimates of marginal climate damages (the present-day value of emitting one tonne of CO into the atmosphere). Based on this finding, Hope argued that present day climate policy was insensitive to whether or not you accepted the validity of the higher emission SRES scenarios.\n\nIPCC author Prof Richard Tol commented on the strengths and weaknesses of the SRES scenarios. In his view, the A2 SRES marker scenario was, by far, the most realistic. UK Government departments Defra and HM Treasury argued that case for action on climate change was not undermined by the Castles and Henderson critique of the SRES scenarios. They also commented that unless effective action was taken to curb emissions growth, other bodies, like the International Energy Agency, expected greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise into the future.\n\nIn a report published by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, Webster \"et al.\" (2008) compared the SRES scenarios with their own “no policy” scenario. Their no-policy scenario assumes that in the future, the world does nothing to limit greenhouse gas emissions. They found that most of the SRES scenarios were outside of the 90% probability range of their no-policy scenario (Webster \"et al.\", 2008, p. 1). Most of the SRES scenarios were consistent with efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Webster \"et al.\" (2008, p. 54) noted that the SRES scenarios were designed to cover most of the range of future emission levels in the published scientific literature. Many such scenarios in the literature presumably assumed that future efforts would be made to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations.\n\nAs part of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the literature on emissions scenarios was assessed. Baseline emissions scenarios published since the SRES were found to be comparable in range to those in the SRES. IPCC (2007) noted that post-SRES scenarios had used lower values for some drivers for emissions, notably population projections. However, of the assessed studies that had incorporated new population projections, changes in other drivers, such as economic growth, resulted in little change in overall emission levels.\n\nIn IPCC Fifth Assessment Report released in 2014, SRES projections were superseded by Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After several failed attempts, KARI turned to Russia's Khrunichev Design Bureau for assistance in developing a liquid-propellant rocket engine for the KSLV-1 as well as for cooperation in the construction of the launch facility at the Naro Space Center. KSLV-1 was transformed into a two-stage launcher, 33 m high with a maximum diameter of 2.9 m. It has a mass of 140 tons at lift-off. The first stage of the launcher was derived from the Russian URM-1 (Universal Rocket Module) developed by Khrunichev. The second stage of the launcher was a solid Kick Motor developed by Korea, which includes the Inertial Navigation System; the power, control, and flight safety systems; plus the nose fairing. KSLV-1 was the most prominent project of the whole South Korean space development program and was successfully launched in late January 2013. \nSouth Korea is planning to launch its next rocket KSLV-2 by year 2021. The first stage of its rocket will have 4 clustered engines, each of which will have a 75 metric ton thrust. It was announced that KARI has already developed few prototypes of a 75 metric ton thrust engine.\n\nThe Test Launch Vehicle (TLV) is an one stage rocket used to test the performance of the 75-ton thrust rocket engine that will power the KSLV-2. \nThe TLV is 25.8 meters in length, 2.6 meters in diameter, and with a mass of 52.1 tons. The main-stage Kerolox engine is fully gimballed.\n\nThe first TLV was launched from the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Jeolla Province. \nThe main objective of the first suborbital flight was for the single-stage rocket's main engine to burn 140 seconds, reaching a 100 km altitude before splashing down in the sea between Jeju Island and Okinawa Island.\n\nThe maiden flight was first delayed from October 25, 2018, for two months, due to abnormal readings detected in the rocket propellant pressurization system.\nThe test flight was then rescheduled for November 28, 2018, at 16:00 KST(UTC+9). No payload is to be placed into orbit.\n\nThe launch of the first TLV while deemed successful with its main engine burning for 151 seconds in a 10-minute flight, was not broadcast live.\nAfter reaching a maximum suborbital altitude of 209 kilometers, the rocket stage hit the ocean 429 kilometers southeast of Jeju.\n\nIn December 2016, KARI signed a lunar exploration technical cooperation with NASA which increased the possibility of exploration success greatly. The Korean Lunar Exploration Program (KLEP) is divided in two phases. Phase 1 incorporates the launch and operation of a lunar orbiter called Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO), which will be the first lunar probe by South Korea, meant to develop and enhance South Korea's technological capabilities, as well as map natural resources from orbit. Phase 2 will include a lunar obiter, a lunar lander, and a rover to be launched together on a KSLV-II South Korean rocket from the Naro Space Center, by 2030.\n\nKASS is the Korean model of satellite-based augmented systems (SBAS), a technology that is capable of reducing GPS error to less than 3m.\nKorea is expected to become the only seventh country in the world to own an SBAS, beginning in July 2020.\n\nKorea Multiple-Purpose Satellite- 3A (KOMPSAT-3A) was launched on 25 March 2015, on a Dnepr-1 launch vehicle from the Jasny Kombarovsky site in Russia. The purpose of the KOMPSAT-3A is to enable us to take advantage of geographical information systems (GIS) in environmental, agricultural, and oceanographic sciences, and to facilitate responding to natural hazards. The KOMPSAT-3A is equipped with two distinctive sensors, a high-resolution multi-spectral (MS) optical sensor, namely the Advanced Earth Image Sensor System-A (AEISS-A), and the Scanner Infrared Imaging System (SIIS).\n\nIn late 2011, KARI unveiled its tiltrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that can fly at around 400 km/hr.\n\n\n"}

It has a station by that name on the city's elevated downtown transit system known as the Detroit People Mover. Greektown is situated between the Renaissance Center, Comerica Park, and Ford Field. \n\nNamed for the historic Greek immigrant community of the early 20th century, the district still has Greek-themed restaurants. Notable buildings include St. Mary Roman Catholic Church (originally built for the former ethnic German congregation of the parish), Second Baptist Church, the Athenium Suite Hotel, and the contemporary Greektown Casino-Hotel within its boundaries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The district is often the site of the Greek community parade in March.\n\nThe area known today as Greektown was first settled in the 1830s by German immigrants, who created a primarily residential neighborhood in the area. However, in the earliest years of the 20th century, most of the ethnic German residents, who had gotten established in the city, began moving from the neighborhood into newer residential areas farther from downtown. As they left, a new wave of Greek immigrants moved into this older housing. Theodore Gerasimos was the first documented Greek immigrant in Detroit. The newly arrived Greeks soon established their own businesses in the neighborhood.\n\nBy the 1920s, the area was developing more commercial structures, and the Greek residents began moving out in turn to newer housing. But the restaurants, stores, and coffeehouses they established remained. The next thirty years brought a melange of immigrants to the few residential spaces left in the neighborhood. Redevelopment in the 1960s led to the neighborhood becoming the site of new municipal buildings and parking.\n\nRealizing the culturally significant neighborhood was at risk, Detroit's ethnic Greek leaders banded together. With the help of the Mayor's office, the streetscape and building exteriors were improved, and additional street lighting was installed. The neighborhood threw a Greek festival in 1966, timed to coincide with Fourth of July celebrations. The festival was a success, and was continued for years until turnout grew too large. By that time, Greektown was firmly established in Detroit. The Greektown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\nChanges continue, and only three full-fledged Greek restaurants remain in Greektown. The neighborhood is a popular restaurant and entertainment district, having many restaurants that serve authentic Greek cuisine, and one of the city's three casinos, Greektown Casino. Certain buildings on Monroe Street feature themes related to the mythical Pegasus, and such historic Greek structures as the Parthenon, and other ancient architecture. Greek music is played on Monroe Street throughout the day. Well-known restaurants include The New Parthenon, The Golden Fleece, Lakon Cafe, Cyprus Taverna, Pegasus Taverna, Pizza Papalis, and Fishbone's Rhythm Kitchen Cafe. The Detroit People Mover has a station at the Greektown Casino on Beaubien Street between Monroe Street and Lafayette Boulevard.\n\nGreektown is featured in the video game \"\" (2005).\n\nIn the American cable TV series \"Low Winter Sun\" (2013), the Detroit Police precinct is located four blocks from Greektown. Maya and Damon \"kick up\" tributes from her bar and from their drug and prostitution earnings to Skelos, Greektown's main crime lord. Seeking to gain independence from Skelos, Damon opens a blind pig outside of Greektown, where he kicks up to Reverend Lowdown (season 1, episodes 3 and 4).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1916475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916475", "title": "Søften", "text": "Søften\n\nSøften (alternative spellings include Suten–1386, Suchten–1399, and Søwten–1489) is a small Danish town in Jutland, roughly three kilometers south of Hinnerup and just northwest of Aarhus. Søften has a population of 2,867 (1st January 2019). Archaeological surveys of the area (2), indicate the earliest settlements dates to the Nordic Iron Age.\n\nSøften is located within an area defined by a small river valley. The river valley, formed topographically due to Weichselian glaciation during the last Ice Age, and runs along the North and West sides of Søften city. The area is relatively hilly (by Danish standards), with slopes leading towards the river valley north of Søften. The narrow wetland of Damsbro Mose runs along the northeast and southwerst sides of Søften Valley.\n\nDamsbro Mose is a wetland area, with a very high water table, encompassing both banks of the river Lilleå between Søften and Hinnerup. The large marshland area is a mixture of rich fen, swamp forest, lakes in the form of old gravel pits and fertilized cultivated meadows.\n\nIn the southern part of the marsh, the vegetation consists of species such as lesser pond sedge, greater tussock sedge, tussock grass, common reed, reed canary grass, reed mace, willow and alder. In the middle of the marshland area is a section along the river with holy grass. In some of the finer parts of the marsh’s northern area can be found the wettest ground with a wide range of plant life such as obtuse-flowered rush, bottlesedge, two-ranked sedge, marsh bird’s-foot trefoil, European swamp thistle,lesser pond sedge, perennial sedge, meadowsweet, northern water hemlock, bog-bean, great water dock, great spearwort, ragged robin, globe-flower and St Peter’s wort. In the drier areas with small hillocks can be found an exciting lowflora such as star sedge and greater yellow-rattle. Flea sedge and salt marsh flat sedge are common. On and around the hillocks are hawkweed, quaking grass, marsh arrow grass, marsh grass-of-Parnassus, western marsh-orchid as well as the rare valerian. The marsh is also a habitat for bird species such as the marsh warbler, grasshopper warbler, nightingale, common snipe, kestrel, lesser whitethroat, whitethroat, coal tit, willow warbler and the lesser redpoll.\n\nThe open marsh landscape was recreated during the Second World War due to the removal of peat on a large scale in the area. From these excavations, the remains of a woman and a young child were found in the marsh, dating to the Nordic Iron Age. Afterwards, remains of a settlement were discovered when building Engdalsvej. During these excavations, traces of dwellings were discovered with preserved stone pavings and pits from the pre-Roman Iron Age. A plan was drawn up for nature and countryside preservation by Naturplan APS for the Municipality of Hinnerup and the County of Aarhus in 1991. In 1992, the Municipality of Hinnerup and the County of Aarhus (which no longer exists) began implementing various initiatives to safeguard the natural values of the marsh. Currently,it is possible to walk the entire length of the marsh following paths between Hinnerup and Søften.\n\nThe Søften Church is one of the oldest Danish buildings and lies on a west-facing slope, where the terrain opens into the valley. The church was originally erected in the late 12th century with later additions over the centuries. Søften church consists of a Romanesque chancel and nave with two Late Gothic additions: a porch at the south door and to the west tower. The Romanesque section was built between 1500-1200 of rough, hewn travertine, split granite boulders as well as bryozoan limestone. Mainly clay seems to have been used as a binding agent. A cross-vault was constructed c. 1462 in the chancel as were three vaulting bays in the nave. During the church’s restoration by the architect M.B. Fritz in 1928, the tower gable and the windows from 1898 were reconstructed. The wall paintings in the vaulting of the church from the 1460s have the armorial bearings of the Bishop of Aarhus Jens Iversen Lange (1449–82). The nave decoration is from the end of the 15th century, while the tower is most likely came afterwards. Church furniture of note, aside from the Romanesque baptismal font, is a pulpit dating from 1572-88 bearing the arms of King Frederik II and his Queen, a bell from 1656, an altarpiece from 1859, a sepulchral tablet from 1663 potentially crafted by the Aarhus carver Rasmus Christensen. There was once a clear view over the fields and meadows into Nørreris Forest in the 1960s, but the view is now limited by modern-day houses.\n\nAfter the Reformation, the patronage rights of the church belonged to King Frederik III until the 25.th of September 1661, when it was transferred to Morgens Friis Favrskov. In 1672, when Frijsenborg county was established, the church was incorporated into it. The church tithe, the maintenance obligation of the church, was sold at an auction on 5 April 1803, to Sejer Sommer at Haraldslund and to Erik Christian Muller at Møllerup. Sommer and Muller sold the tithe together with the individual farms to the parish’s citizens. On January 1.st 1910, the church became privately owned.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, there were excavations at Søften. The study, led by Moesgård Museum, was spread over an area of six fields just East of Søften. During the summer of 2013, there was a continuation of the study from five years prior. At the site, the sub soil varies greatly, from bold clay over sandy clay and clay-like sand to gravel and rocky sand.\n\nIn April and May 2008, archaeologists excavated two smaller fields and a small piece of land between commercial buildings in Søften. Initial expectations were to find little evidence of settlements from Pre-Roman Iron Age, Bronze or Neolithic Ages. Farm plants were previously excavated south and southeast of the site from Pre-Roman Iron Age and two mounds of graves from the Early Roman Iron Age. Test trenches on the easternmost part of the site found evidence of postholes that were interpreted as pit-houses. Plant material collected was then dated to the Late Germanic Iron Age or Viking Age and subsequently many of the ditches were covered without further study until a proper archaeological excavation could take place.\n\nDuring this field season, fourteen pit houses, a three-aisled long house, a well and a fencing- all from the Late Iron Age and Viking Age, were excavated. Textile tools, iron objects, traces of iron refining, some imported pottery and evidence of glass processing were found. All of the dated items found are from the Viking Age. It was also possible for the archaeologists to identify certain aspects of pit houses construction and in some cases their function. Soil samples were taken and utilized in pollen analysis in order to identify plant potentially incorporated in textile dyeing.\n\nAt the current excavation expectations were to examine a traditional settlement from the Early Roman Iron Age through the investigation of settlement pits, cultural layers and refuse, and posthole analysis of houses. The cultural layers preserved floor layers and details of house construction as well as a stonepath. As the season progressed Viking Age pit houses were exposed and excavated. This survey will supplement the analysis and methods of the 2008 excavations.\n\nThe site is located on a predominantly gravel piece of land, facing south towards the wetland Damsbro Mose. There is a pattern of similar pit-houses along the river system on the other side of the wetland. This apparent strategic location may reveal a ranking between the sites through the individual pit-house features. Metal detecting in and around the pit-houses at Søften found various including a dirham and iron objects such as a knife, a chisel, a pair of rivets. Adjacent to the wetland is a massive fringe of ildskørnede flints, burned material and fist-sized stones. Stavnsager, a site in Jutland, has massive numbers of ildskørnede flints associated with the process of steam bending ship timber. Another use of these flints may have been to heat water for the fulling of large textile pieces.\n\nThe pit house soil samples from the 2008 excavation were used in pollen analysis and showed that the pollen present was not indicative of wind-dispersed pollen (from trees for instance) and did not reflect the species of the surrounding environment. These results are expected of enclosures like pit-houses, or places effected by human activity. The identification of plant species indicated plants previously used for food, medicinal purposes, dyeing or tanning (5).This research lends towards the theory that the pit-houses may have been used for storage, dyeing and tanning and/or production in general.\n\nThe preservation of the floor layer beneath the cultural layer provides interesting details of house construction. It is particularly unusual for East Jutland, however in other parts of the country there are several examples ofwell-preserved house sites with pavements. In particular, the houses in the settlement mounds from Gautenag and the rest of Limfjord area.\n\nThe geography of the site contextualizes the interpretation of the site. The pattern of pit-houses along the river Lilleå coupled with the interpreted textile and glass processing production of the pit-houses points towards the site’s potential involvement in trade.\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1992 and was notorious for its sometimes dangerous cost-cutting measures. All of the airline's planes were purchased used from other airlines, very little training was provided to workers, and contractors were used for maintenance and other services. The company quickly developed a reputation for its relaxed safety. In 1995, the military refused ValuJet's bid to fly military personnel over safety worries, and officials at the FAA wanted the airline to be grounded.\n\nThe crash of Flight 592 in 1996, which was caused by illegally stored hazardous materials on board, spelled doom for the airline. ValuJet was grounded the next month and not allowed to fly again until September, with a greatly reduced fleet. The airline's major customers never returned and the company suffered major losses. \n\nIn 1997, the airline’s parent holding company purchased the much smaller regional airline holding company Airways Corporation, the holding company for AirTran Airways. ValuJet’s fleet and operations were transferred to AirTran in 1998 and ValuJet was merged into AirTran Airways in 1999. Although ValuJet was the nominal survivor and the merged company was run by ValuJet management, the merged airline took the AirTran name.\n\nValuJet was founded in 1992 and began operations on October 26, 1993. It originally offered service from Atlanta to Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa with a single Douglas DC-9 that previously belonged to Delta Air Lines. The first flight, Flight 901, flew from Atlanta to Tampa. The carrier was headed by a group of industry veterans including co-founder and chairman Robert Priddy, who had started a string of successful airlines including Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA), Air Midwest Airlines, and Florida Gulf Airlines. Board members Maury Gallagher and Tim Flynn, the other co-founders, developed and ran WestAir before selling it to Mesa Airlines; former Continental Airlines and Flying Tigers President Lewis Jordan joined the carrier a short time later as president.\n\nThe airline went public in June 1994 after a year of tremendous growth with the addition of 15 aircraft since the first flight in 1993. It became the fastest airline to make a profit in the history of American aviation, earning $21 million in 1994 alone. In October 1995, ValuJet placed an order with McDonnell Douglas for 50 MD-95 jets (now known as the Boeing 717) with an option for 50 more. To keep costs low, the airline bought many used aircraft from around the world. At the time ValuJet's fleet was among the oldest in the United States, averaging 26 years. In 1995, the airline sued Delta Air Lines and TWA over landing slots.\n\nLike most low-cost airlines, ValuJet did not own any hangars or spare parts inventories. However, many of the measures it took to hold down fares were very aggressive even by low-cost standards. For example, it required pilots to pay for their own training and only paid them after completed flights. Its flight attendants only received basic training. It also outsourced many functions other airlines handle themselves. For instance, it subcontracted maintenance to several companies, and these companies in turn subcontracted the work to other companies. Whenever delays were caused by mechanics, ValuJet cut the pay of the mechanics working on that plane.\n\nIn August 1995, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) rejected ValuJet's bid to fly military personnel, citing serious deficiencies in ValuJet's quality assurance procedures.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Atlanta field office sent a memo on February 14, 1996, to its headquarters in Washington, D.C., stating that \"consideration should be given to an immediate FAR 121 re-certification of this airline\"—in other words, the FAA wanted ValuJet grounded. ValuJet airplanes made 15 emergency landings in 1994, 57 in 1995, and 57 from January through May 1996. In February, the FAA ordered ValuJet to seek approval before adding any new aircraft or cities to their network, something the industry had not seen since deregulation in 1979. This attempt at removing ValuJet's certification was \"lost in the maze at FAA\" according to NTSB Chairman Jim Hall. By this time, ValuJet's accident rate was not only one of the highest in the low-fare sector, but was more than 14 times that of the legacy airlines.\n\nOn May 11, 1996, ValuJet suffered its highest-profile accident when Flight 592, a DC-9 flying from Miami to Atlanta, crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people on board. The crash was caused by an onboard fire triggered by full chemical oxygen generators that were illegally stowed in the cargo hold without their safety caps, by maintenance subcontractor SabreTech. The resulting investigation revealed numerous systemic flaws, and ultimately faulted both SabreTech for storing the generators on the plane along with ValuJet for not supervising them.\n\nAfter the crash, many of ValuJet's other cost-cutting practices came under scrutiny. One of its planes flew 140 times despite a leaky hydraulic system, and another flew 31 times with malfunctioning weather radar. Another plane was allowed to fly despite engine rust that went unnoticed during its refit; it caught fire a few months later and was completely destroyed. At the time of the crash, the FAA was in the final stages of a three-month review of ValuJet's operations. The Transportation Department originally wanted to give ValuJet a clean bill of health. However, due to strong objections from the department's Inspector General, Mary Schiavo, the FAA grounded ValuJet on June 11, 1996.\n\nOn September 26, 1996, ValuJet resumed flying with 15 jets, down from 52 before the crash, after complying with all DOT and FAA requirements. On November 4, 1996, ValuJet announced that Joseph Corr, former CEO of Continental Airlines, would become CEO and President at a time when the airline was in serious trouble. However, its highest-paying customers never returned, and it had lost $55 million since the crash of Flight 592.\n\nAfter the large amount of negative publicity surrounding the Flight 592 incident, ValuJet suffered serious financial problems. On July 11, 1997, they announced that it would merge with the much smaller \"Airways Corporation\", parent of AirTran Airways which was completed on November 17, 1997. Airways Corporation was merged into the ValuJet holding company (ValuJet, Inc.) and the ValuJet holding company changed its name to AirTran Holdings; the ValuJet holding company now AirTran Holdings retained the ValuJet pre-1997 stock price history. In November 1997, the AirTran Holdings announced it would move its headquarters from Atlanta to Orlando.\n\nThe holding company formerly with the ValuJet name, renamed ValuJet Airlines to AirTran Airlines with all fleet and operations being transferred to AirTran Airways in 1998 and then merging into AirTran Airways in 1999. The ValuJet name was retired. However, ValuJet was the nominal survivor. \n\nAirTran, prior to its purchase by Southwest, made no notable mention of its past as ValuJet. Instead, AirTran kept a large cache of ValuJet memorabilia, including radio ads, locked in an Atlanta warehouse. AirTran also opted not to make any major announcements on the crash's tenth anniversary out of respect for the victims' families.\n\nValuJet operated a fleet of 48 aircraft consisting of McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, along with a few McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. The aircraft were fitted with orange seats. Most of the aircraft were more than 15 years old, many obtained from other carriers. ValuJet had on average one of the oldest fleets in America averaging 27 years. All the planes were painted white with blue and yellow trim, with the smiling \"critter\" painted on both sides of the plane on the front. ValuJet's FAA call sign was \"critter\" due to the airline's smiling airplane logo.\n\nAt the time of its demise the fleet consisted of:\n\n\nValuJet's main hub was in Atlanta, and their focus cities were Orlando, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami, and Washington Dulles. Before the crash of Flight 592, ValuJet operated to 22 cities in the U.S. and one in Canada. Most people chose ValuJet for their low fares, such as $39 tickets for a flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville.\n\nOn June 8, 1995, a DC-9-32, suffered an aborted takeoff from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport after a catastrophic engine failure which was caused by rusted engine components. ValuJet was aware of the problem, but did not have the budget to fix it and allowed the aircraft to keep flying. Shrapnel from the right engine penetrated the fuselage and the right engine main fuel line, and a cabin fire erupted. The airplane was stopped on the runway, and captain Greg Straessle ordered evacuation of the airplane. The plane was on a scheduled flight to Miami International Airport.\n\nThe subsequent fire destroyed the aircraft. Among the five crew members, one flight attendant received serious puncture wounds from shrapnel and thermal injuries, and another flight attendant received minor injuries. Of the 57 passengers on board, five suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the engine failure was caused by a detectable crack in a compressor disk, on which a maintenance contractor had failed to perform a proper inspection and had kept poor records. The incident resulted in the NTSB issuing an advisory recommending improvements to maintenance rules throughout the industry.\nOn Sunday January 7, 1996, ValuJet Flight 558, another DC-9-32, FAA registration N922VV, while on final approach to Nashville International Airport encountered pressurization problems. Because of this, the crew pulled the Ground Control Relay (GCR) circuit breakers H20 and J20. When on the final approach to runway 02R at 100 feet, the cabin was completely depressurized, so the captain reset the breakers. As a result, the spoilers suddenly activated automatically, causing the jet to enter a high sink rate, striking the runway at full power and in a nose high attitude. Five people received minor injuries.\n\nValuJet Flight 592, another DC-9-32, crashed in the Florida Everglades on Saturday, May 11, 1996 due to a fire caused by the activation of chemical oxygen generators that were illegally shipped in the cargo hold by ValuJet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech. The fire damaged the airplane's electrical system and eventually overcame the crew, resulting in the deaths of all 110 people on board. The airplane was on its way from Miami to Atlanta.\n\n\n"}

Owned by Rogers Media, the station broadcasts a Top 40 (CHR) format branded as \"KiSS 92.5\". The station is one of two top-40 stations licensed to the city of Toronto (the other being CKFM-FM).\n\nCKIS's studios are located at the Rogers Building at Bloor and Jarvis Streets in the northeastern corner of downtown Toronto, while its transmitter is located atop First Canadian Place.\n\nOn July 31, 1989, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced a call for applications to license a new FM station on the 92.5 frequency, which was believed to be the last available FM frequency in the Toronto market. On August 8, 1990, Rawlco Communications was awarded a licence from the CRTC for a new FM radio station. The format chosen to air on the frequency was country music that would target an audience ranging from 25–54 years of age. Rawlco planned on changing frequencies for the station to 99.1 FM, which was formerly the home of CKO-FM-1, but cancelled the plan after the CRTC denied this. On January 26, 1993, at 1 p.m., singer Anne Murray pressed the button to launch the station, with the CISS-FM call letters and \"CISS-FM 92.5\" (pronounced \"kiss\") branding.\n\nThe station's licensing by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission had been controversial, because the CRTC had passed over an application by Milestone Radio for an urban music station, which would have been a new format in the Toronto market, in favour of Rawlco's application. Milestone's second attempt at an urban station was also passed over in favour of CBLA; the company finally won a licence on its third attempt, and launched CFXJ-FM in 2001.\n\nRogers Communications announced a deal to buy the station in February 1999. The deal would not be completed until August, but immediately after the deal was announced, Rogers took control of the station's programming by way of a local management agreement or LMA (at the time, LMAs were not actively regulated by the CRTC). Without much warning, on February 5, 1999, at 7:30 p.m., the station flipped formats to Top 40 (CHR) and changed monikers to \"Power 92\", becoming the first city-grade Top 40 station to serve Toronto since the demise of CHOG in October 1995. The final song on \"CISS-FM\" was \"The Dance\" by Garth Brooks, while the first song on \"Power\" was \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" by Lauryn Hill.\n\nThe way the transition was announced to most of the station's on-air staff became legendary in Canadian radio circles;they were taken out for a party to celebrate the success of the country station, then returned to the station, unaware, to find their access passes no longer worked and they were out of work. When the station flipped to Power 92, the station attracted adverse attention from the operators of CKDX, then a dance music station branded as \"Power 88.5\" in Newmarket, north of Toronto, and from Corus Entertainment, which owned several \"Power\" stations in western Canada at the time, and who had taken steps towards potentially turning their Toronto rock music station CILQ-FM (\"Q107\") in a new direction as \"Power 107\". On February 26, 1999, the station rebranded as \"Kiss 92 FM\". The station would later rebrand as \"Kiss 92.5\".\n\nIn its early days, the station also aired imaging material in which an announcer pronounced the name of the city \"Toe-ron-toe\", widely considered a mispronunciation of Toronto. New material was soon substituted.\n\nThanks to former CRTC content regulations on FM radio, CISS-FM was the first, and remained the only, top 40/CHR station on FM licensed to the City of Toronto in the late 1990s and early 2000s (the closest formatted station in the market, CIDC, which airs a dance-heavy Top 40 format, is licensed to Orangeville, and is a rimshot from the northwestern portion of the market). The station rode a wave of popularity for pop music acts like Backstreet Boys and N'SYNC, and often seemed to supertarget a primary market of young teenage or preteen girls. In addition, CISS-FM was more rhythmic-leaning than most Top 40 stations due to the market not having an urban or rhythmic station until 2001, when CFXJ-FM signed on the air with an urban format.\n\nStation personalities included Jay Michaels, first paired with Daryn Jones as \"Mad Dog and Daryn\" and then with Billie Holiday in mornings as Mad Dog and Billie (frequently accompanied by voice actress Stephanie Beard as \"Suga BayBee\"), Kris James (a re-hired veteran of the country format, and temporarily the CHR format's first morning host) middays, Tarzan Dan afternoons, Cory Kimm and Taylor Kaye evenings, and Slim hosting \"Slim Jams\", a slow jam/R&B program in overnights.\n\nBy 2002, somewhat ironically, the station moved to take CFXJ's turf with a complete shift to a rhythmic contemporary format billed as \"Toronto's Hip Hop and R&B.\" The station hired local urban flavoured talent DJX and Haddy, Axel, Kwame, DJ Baby Yu and RG.\n\nOn June 4, 2003, at 4:07 p.m., the station flipped to the Jack FM branding and the adult hits format, which had proved quite successful on Rogers-owned stations in Calgary and Vancouver. The station would adopt the CJAQ-FM call letters in February 2004 (with CISS being moved to a Rogers-owned station in Ottawa). The station experienced a ratings drop after the flip, most likely because of the popularity of the previous format. However, once the station established itself, the station gained a boost in the ratings.\n\nWhen it first launched, \"Jack FM\" operated without disc jockeys in an effort to establish the \"Playing What We Want\" concept which was new to Toronto. Though DJs were introduced within weeks of the debut, the station would become Canada's first DJ-free station in late September 2005. At the time, station GM/program director Pat Cardinal cited the move was \"a result of listener feedback. The audience has been telling us that they want no DJs on Jack. They want more music.\" In November 2005, Cardinal defended his decision in an interview with Michael Hainsworth of Report on Business Television and stated why he doesn't see commercial-free iPods and satellite radio as a threat to a non-DJ format. Despite the move, the station's ratings would dive from a 4.1 share in 2005 to the 2.3 share range in 2006.\n\nPat Cardinal would be replaced as GM/PD in June 2006 by Steve Kennedy, who had experience with the \"Jack FM\" format in Calgary. The previous month, the Jack FM playlist would be adjusted to mainstream rock, with the station dropping most pop songs in an effort to compete against Corus-owned stations CILQ-FM (classic rock) and CFNY-FM (modern rock). The move put a dent in the music variety that is a hallmark of the Jack FM format and its \"playing what we want\" slogan (which CJAQ still used at the time and would not replace until March 2008, when it adopted the slogan \"Toronto's Best Rock Variety\"). The move to rock would further hamper CJAQ's overall share in the Toronto radio market (down 17%), even in the male target demographic (down 14%).\n\nOn December 11, 2006, CJAQ abandoned its DJ-free format when they launched a new morning show featuring Ben McVie and Kerry Gray, the former morning team at Dave FM in Cambridge). DJs would surface on other dayparts on December 12, 2006, including Jeff Chalmers and Samantha Stevens. Ben and Kerry were eventually fired on August 16, 2007 and replaced by Jeff Chalmers and Larissa Primeau. Chalmers and Primeau were dismissed in September 2008 and replaced by Carly Klassen and Jeff Brown. (Brown, the former PD of CHEZ-FM in Ottawa, replaced Steve Kennedy as PD on July 4, 2007, when Rogers market manager Sandy Sanderson became GM.) Brown and Klassen would be holding down both the morning and afternoon drive slots by May 2009, one month after \"Jack FM\" registered a dismal 2.0 share in the BBM ratings results for the Toronto market.\n\nAt 3 p.m. on June 5, 2009 (one day after the 6th anniversary of Jack FM's launch), after playing \"Boy Inside the Man\" by Tom Cochrane & Red Rider, the station would revert to Top 40/CHR as \"KiSS 92.5\". KiSS 92.5 started with a stretch of 10,000 songs without commercial or DJ interruption, beginning with \"Boom Boom Pow\" by The Black Eyed Peas. KiSS 92.5 (which would eventually swap the CJAQ-FM call sign for Calgary's CKIS-FM) features a music playlist consisting mainly of pop, hip-hop and R&B music; the station often avoids rock music, though it does include some Canadian rock artists to meet Canadian content regulations. KiSS competes head-on with Toronto area stations CKFM (Mainstream Top 40/CHR), CIDC (which airs a dance-leaning Top 40/CHR format, and is based in the suburbs), and Rhythmic CHR-formatted CFXJ, as well as, to a lesser extent, Toronto hot AC station CHUM-FM, and top 40 station WKSE in Buffalo.\n\nIt was announced on July 8, 2009 that \"ET Canada\"'s Roz Weston will be hosting the new morning show, along with Mocha, formerly of Kitchener, Ontario's CKBT. Both were formerly co-hosts and producers of \"Mad Dog & Billie\" during the station's first Top 40 incarnation.\n\nBeginning in January 2010, CKIS-FM would offer \"Commercial Free Mondays,\" a campaign patterned after many Top 40/CHR stations across the United States, and offer hourly prize giveaways. (CKIS followed Edmonton's CHBN-FM as the 2nd station in Canada to offer a whole day commercial-free; KiSS competitor CIDC-FM would follow suit one month later with a promotion they label as \"The Zone,\" also on Mondays.)\n\nIn February 2011, the station moved towards a more mainstream direction. Their main rival CIDC-FM (Z103-5) began leaning towards rhythmic at the same time. This happened most likely because CKIS began beating CIDC in the ratings, although CIDC's signal covers most Greater Toronto Area suburbs (as well as their studios also located in west Toronto), while CKIS is targets the City of Toronto itself.\n\nIn 2013, the station's DJ Clymaxxx and Mocha won their 2nd consecutive Stylus Award for 'Radio Mixshow DJs of the Year' for Set It Off.\n\nIn April 2016, the CRTC granted approval for CKIS to utilize HD Radio operations. On June 27, CKIS added simulcasts of CFTR and CJCL on their HD2 and HD3 sub-channels, respectively.\n\n"}

The college opened its first satellite campus in Calgary in 2006 in partnership with the Calgary Stampede Board.\n\nTotal student enrollment for the 2008–2009 year was 1,350.\n\nThe college is a member of the Alberta Rural Development Network.\n\nIn 1913, the Alberta provincial government established three demonstration farms near Olds, Fairview, and near the Vermilion townsite. The Olds farm later became known as Olds Agricultural College. In 1963, the name was changed to Olds Agricultural and Vocational College to reflect course offerings which were expanding beyond agriculture. In 1970, the name was simplified to Olds College. In addition, provincial administration of the college was moved from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Advanced Education at that time.\n\nOlds College has two campuses. The main campus, located on the eastern edge of the township of Olds, accommodates the majority of enrolled students. The campus covers over 2,000 acres (810 ha) and includes a number of buildings designed to support the specialized programming offered at Olds College.\n\nAnimal Health Building is home to the National Meat Training Centre at Olds College, and the Animal Health Technology program, including housing facilities for small animals, and research and veterinary facilities.\n\nRalph Klein Centre is home to the Community Learning Campus, The CLC Fitness Centre, the Olds High School, and also has government administration offices. The facility was named after the late Ralph Klein, former premier of Alberta. The Ralph Klein Centre is also home to the Olds College Broncos, and where they host the majority of their games.\n\nLand Sciences Building. The Land Sciences building is connected to the Greenhouses and Landscape Pavilion, and features classrooms, typically in use by Horticulture and Land & Environment Classes, as well as offices for faculty in those programs. Land Sciences (LSC) and James Murray Building (JMB) host the Land Agent, Land Analyst and Land & Water Resources Programs. Here students can specialize in programs like the Environmental Stewardship & Rural Planning Major, a program that is accredited by CACPT (Canadian Association for Certified Planning Technicians). Planning students attend regular field schools in the area or at the Mountain View County Planning Offices, just south of Olds.\n\nThe highlight of the Land Sciences Building is the atrium, a glass seating area filled with vegetation. The atrium occasionally hosts special events.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Theatre opened in late 2008. The facility offers a 350+ seat theatre which is used for community events, high school drama productions and more. This provides a wide range of learning opportunities for high school students as well as Olds College students, who produce fashion apparel for the productions, create stage sets, and more. This building is also home to the Pre-Employment Hair Stylist program, offered in partnership between Olds College and Chinook’s Edge School Division.\n\nThe Olds College campus is home to the Frank Grisdale Hall residence, which hosts 350 students, and a number of townhouses available to second and third year students. In 2014, ground was broken on the new, state of the art Centennial Village residence, which will be open for the Fall 2015 school term.\n\nThe Library Research Commons (LRC) is home to the Library, Alumni Centre, Students’ Association offices, and the Bell E-Learning Centre\nThe main campus is also home to the Botanic Gardens and Treatment Wetlands and two riding arenas.\nThe Calgary campus was opened in 2006 and is located in the Bow Valley College south campus 7th Floor.\n\nOlds College offers over 30 programs. They are authorized by the Government of Alberta to grant certificates, diplomas, Bachelor of Applied Science Degrees and Apprenticeship designations.\n\nOlds College also offers University Transfer programs, and a number of Continuing Education options including courses in the fields of Agriculture, Animal Sciences, Business, Land and Environment, Machinery & Trades, Plants and Horticulture and Special Interest.\n\nIn December, 2012 Olds College entered into an agreement with two Calgary based companies, GoForth Institute and world-class app-designer Robots and Pencils Inc. to provide an iPad-based mobile gamified application in entrepreneurship for students. All new students entering Olds College with a longer-term certificate, diploma, or applied degree will be required to complete this app as part of a graduation requirement.\n\nOlds College offers over 450 scholarships, bursaries and awards annually, valued at over $500,000.\n\nThe Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. Olds College scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: TransAlta Aboriginal Educational Awards.\n\nThe Olds College Centre for Innovation (OCCI) is the applied research division of Olds College. Olds College actively pursues involvement in applied research that advances innovation-based rural economic development in Alberta.\n\nOCCI conducts research on composting technology (including bio-gas energy), environmental microbiology, livestock genetics and nutrition, natural fibers, and new products from crops and bio-processing.\n\nThe Prairie Turfgrass Research Centre is a long-standing joint partnership between the Olds College Centre for Innovation (OCCI) and the industry led Alberta Turfgrass Research Foundation (ATRF).

Integrated with the Olds College Campus, the CLC consists of five multi-use facilities complete with integrated programming.\n\nSharon Carry served as registrar and vice president of student and support services at Olds College.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916516", "title": "Gold State Coach", "text": "Gold State Coach\n\nThe Gold State Coach is an enclosed, eight-horse-drawn carriage used by the British Royal Family. Commissioned in 1760, it was built in the London workshops of Samuel Butler. It was commissioned for £7,562(£1.5 million = US$1.98 million in 2018, adjusted for inflation).\n\nThis coach has been used at the coronation of every British monarch since George IV. The coach's great age, weight, and lack of manoeuvrability have limited its use to grand state occasions such as coronations, royal weddings, and the jubilees of a monarch.\nThe coach is housed at the Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace. It is on view for the public.\n\nThe coach weighs four tons and is long and high. It is gilded and features painted panels by Giovanni Battista Cipriani and rich gilded sculpture including three cherubs on the roof (representing England, Ireland and Scotland) and four tritons, one at each corner (representing Britain's imperial power). The body of the coach is slung by braces covered with Morocco leather and decorated with gilt buckles. The interior is lined with velvet and satin. The sculptor Sir Joseph Wilton produced the elaborate carvings on the coach. The roof supports three cherubs representing the union of England, Scotland and Ireland. They carry the Imperial Crown and hold the sword, scepter and the badge representing Knighthood. The branches of eight gilded palm trees frame the roof. Four corner trees rise from a lion's head and are decorated with symbols of Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War with France. The war was drawing to a close when the coach was built in 1762. Morocco leather straps support the body of the coach and are held by four Triton, mythical sea-gods with a man's head and a dolphin's tail. At the front wheels, the tritons seem to be using the straps to pull the coach. They are blowing conchs, trumpet-like shells to herald the arrival of the Monarch of the Ocean. Gilded dolphins hold in place the bar by which the coach is drawn, and the driver's foot board (no longer used) is in the shape of a scallop shell. The two tritons at the back carry imperial symbols, representing Britain's maritime traditions and status as a dominant sea power.\n\nThe carvings give the Gold Coach the air of a triumphant chariot, reflecting England's powerful position in the world at the time.\n\nThe Gold State Coach is pulled by a team of eight horses wearing the Red Morocco harness. Originally driven by a coachman, the eight horses are now postilion-ridden in four pairs. The coach is so heavy it can only be pulled at a walk. The coach has (gilded) brakes, which are operated by the grooms.\n\nAs the coach is suspended from braces, it lacks more modern comfort. Modern coaches such as the Australian State Coach and the Diamond Jubilee State Coach have electric windows, heating and hydraulic stabilizers.\n\nIn the words of King William IV, a former naval officer, being driven in the Gold State Coach was like being on board a ship \"tossing in a rough sea\". Queen Victoria complained of the \"distressing oscillation\" of the cabin. She would often refuse to ride in the Gold State Coach. A later monarch, King George VI said that his journey from the palace to Westminster Abbey for his coronation was \"one of the most uncomfortable rides I have ever had in my life\". Queen Elizabeth II, referred to her coronation journey in the coach as \"horrible\" and \"not very comfortable\". \n\nKing George VI had the coach overhauled after the Second World War to rubberize the iron-bound wheels. This would afford at least some comfort to the passengers.\n\nThe Gold State Coach has been used since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. She used it on the days of her Silver and Golden Jubilees.\n\nThe coach is managed by four postilions, nine walking grooms (one of whom walks behind the coach), six footmen, and four Yeoman of the Guard carrying their long partisans. Eight of the grooms walk beside the horses. The more ornately dressed footmen walk beside the body of the coach. The postilions have to handle the horses when the animals are unruly, and they carry crooked walking-sticks to hold up the traces that may become slack when the coach is taking a corner. The royal coachmen are traditionally clean-shaven. The horses are always Windsor Greys.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1916517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916517", "title": "Topanga State Park", "text": "Topanga State Park\n\nTopanga State Park is a California state park located in the Santa Monica Mountains, within Los Angeles County, California. It is part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The park has been closed since April 7, 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe park is located adjacent to the community of Topanga, within the City of Los Angeles. Covering 11,000 acres (45 km²), with thirty-six miles of trails and unimproved roads, the park's boundaries stretch from Topanga Canyon to Pacific Palisades and Mullholland Drive. There are more than 60 trail entrances. Topanga State Park is not only the largest park in the Santa Monica Mountains, but it's also considered to be the largest park located in the limits of a city.\n\nThe word Topanga is an old Shoshonean language word meaning 'above' and referring to the canyon settlement being above the flood waters of Topanga Creek. The Tongva and Chumash peoples inhabited the area for thousands of years. The land of Topanga Canyon was originally inhabited by Native American groups collectively referred to as the Topanga Culture, including the Chumash and Tongva.\n\nJuan Rodriguez Cabrillo first claimed California for Spain in 1542. The Topanga region was not invaded until after the establishment of the Pueblo de Los Angeles and Mission San Fernando Rey de España in the late 1700s. When Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, control of Alta California went to the new government. In 1828 the Mexican Governor of Alta California granted Francisco Sepulveda provisional title to the more than 30,000 acres called Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica. The rancho included the eastern portion of the City of Santa Monica, Santa Monica Canyon, and the mountains to the ridgeline on the west bank of Topanga Creek. The land remained relatively unused, except for flat portions used for crops and grazing. The steeper sections were deemed unusable, even for sheep and cattle.\nCalifornia became part of the United States in 1848, and a state in 1850. Eventually ownership of the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica Mexican land grant was confirmed by the U.S. Land Claims Commission. The land was made available under the Homestead Act. Among the many homestead patents filed in the Santa Monica Mountains, the one filed by a beekeeper named McAtee was for the western edge of the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica, and area along what became Entrada Road, the current main entrance to Topanga State Park.\n\nIn the 1920s, the canyon became a popular weekend get-away destination for residents of growing Los Angeles. Summer cabins were built along Topanga Creek and throughout the area in subdivisions in the surrounding hills. In this same trend, in 1917, Oscar A. Trippet, Sr. bought half of the McAtee homestead, which he and his family used as a get-away from the city. When Trippet died in 1923, his son, Oscar Jr., commissioned Los Angeles architect Summer Spaulding to build the superintendent's house, horse stables, and a skeet lodge. A stock pond was also built which is still located inside the park at the northeast corner of the parking lot. The Trippet family owned of the land until 1963 when it was sold to a developer.\n\nThe next year, 1964, a park bond was approved by voters to purchase Trippet Ranch and some adjoined land. Topanga State Park was opened to the public in 1974. Its land includes more than 7,500 acres from the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica land grant. Additional acreage has been added in the form of 1,500 acres from the Palisades Highlands and another 1,600 acres added in 2002, near the mouth of the Topanga Creek.\n\nGeologically, the park has many sedimentary sandstone rock formations, marine fossils, exposed faults, and volcanic intrusions.\n\nThe primary habitats in the park are of the Coastal sage scrub and montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregions. In Trippet Ranch there is a significant area of California oak woodland. The smaller habitats include bay laurel woodland (\"Umbellularia californica\"), walnut woodland (\"Juglans californica\"), and grassland savannah. The various types of plants and habitats are due to microclimate differences across the park.\n\nThere are over eighty mammal species and more than sixty reptile and amphibian species. Snakes present include the Southern Pacific rattlesnake (\"Crotalus oreganus helleri\"). Topanga State Park is home to many species of migratory and resident bird species.\n\nThe Topanga Nature Center houses a collection of mounted native animals and birds, as well as hands-on displays of natural artifacts. It is dedicated to the flora, fauna and geography of the area. The Center is located in the lodge formerly used by Trippet Ranch for skeet shooting, a short walk from the Trippet Ranch parking lot, and is currently open on Sunday afternoons only.\n\nPoints of interest in the park include: Eagle Rock, Eagle Spring Trail, and Hub Junction. Three historical attractions of the park are Trippet Ranch buildings, Will Roger's cabin, and the Josepho Barn.\n\nMany trails exist within the park, which are accessible to hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders, as posted. The primary trailheads are at the Trippet Ranch area, including for the Musch Trail, passing prominent Eagle Rock. Many trails also are wider dirt fire roads. Unpaved portions of Mulholland Drive are accessible through the Temescal Fire Road and Mulholland Drive.\n\nThe Backbone Trail System, a multi-use long-distance trail spanning nearly 70 miles across the Santa Monica Mountains, passes through Topanga State Park. It can be accessed via the Trippet Ranch trailhead.\n\nThe Santa Inez Trail is accessible from Trippet Ranch on the west, or the Palisades Highlands neighborhood on the east. The trail's lower section follows Santa Inez Creek through riparian habitats, and then climbs through unique and massive sandstone formations to the Topanga Fire Road and Trippet Ranch.\n\nWhile never actually closed to the public, Topanga State Park was on a list of 48 California state parks proposed in January 2008 for closure by California's then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program. In protest, environmentalists and area residents collected more than 17,000 signatures asking that the closure idea be halted, with the petition delivered to the governor by a symbolic delegation of school children. This direct public action was credited with averting the proposed closure.\n\nIn July 2012, it was reported that nearly $54 million in \"hidden\" funds was in the possession of California's state park system, creating widespread anger. The funds were more than enough to have covered any of the alleged state park budget shortfalls, and State Parks Director Ruth Coleman, in charge for a decade, resigned her position, with her second in command being fired. Coleman denied any knowledge of the secret assets. Later, the $54 million figure was reported to be misrepresented, with the actual hidden surplus amounting to $20 million, still enough to cover the alleged shortfall that had prompted the plans to close as many as 70 California state parks. In February 2013 it was revealed that the approximately $20 million had been hidden for as long as 20 years by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nIn August 2012, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that he secured federal funds to help improve parks and public areas. His first project was to help restore sections of the 65 mile Backbone Trail, one of the most popular trails in the park and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Congressman said, \"The Backbone Trail provides thousands of hikers, bicyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts with an unparalleled recreational experience through the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. These improvements will enhance that experience and improve safety for everyone that uses this popular trail.\" The money is going to go to clearing back brush on the trails, fixing and preventing landslides along the trail, and repairing the Chicken Bridge in the park. Hikers have reported significant improvements to the trails, and the project was completed in 2013.\n\n\n"}

In 1997, she wrote an \"Economist\" article named \"Sex Is War!\" which was awarded the Glaxo Wellcome Prize by the British Science Writers Association.\n\nHer first book, \"Dr Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation\" (2002), grew out of that article. Written in the style of a sex-advice column to animals, the book details the variety of sexual practices in the natural world and provides the reader with an overview of the evolutionary biology of sex. The book was praised by critics as being witty and engaging, without compromising its scientific integrity. It became an international best-seller, translated into 16 languages and was nominated for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction in 2003.\n\nJudson has also worked as a television presenter.

Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction (TUR) can be subdivided into direct and indirect. Direct use focuses on substituting inputs in the production process and redesigning products to use less or no toxic chemicals. In the indirect process, there are process modifications, operation improvements, and recycling of chemicals.\n\nIn the United States, toxics use reduction programs were set up by some state legislatures during the early 1990s, including in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Oregon. Program elements may include mandatory reporting of toxic chemical use, reduction planning requirements, research and technical assistance. In the mid-1990s, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considered toxics use reporting or materials accounting as an expansion of the public right to know on toxic chemical use. In 1990, Congress issued the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 to try to reduce toxins. Though the restrictions are limited, it is still practiced in over thirty states. The agency issued an advance notice of its proposed rule making in 1996, though toxics use reporting was not adopted.\n\nThe Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) program of 1989 requires facilities that use large amounts of toxic chemicals are required to report on their chemical use, conduct toxics use reduction planning every two years, and pay a fee. The fees paid by TURA filers support the work of the TURA implementing agencies, and are used to provide a wide variety of services to toxics users, including education, training, grant programs and technical assistance. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute, and the Massachusetts Office of Technical Assistance and Technology (OTA) implement the goals of TURA.\n\nIn Europe, attention to toxics use reduction may be seen in the European Union's new regulatory framework (adopted 2003) for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).\n\nLatin America and Asia have industrialized at tremendous rates over the past decades. In doing so, governments focused on output to develop the economy while not paying attention to the environment. This has resulted in toxic accumulation in the land and in water sources. Organisations such as Clean Production Action have published resources for activists to formulate strategies to lobby governments for a less toxic producing industrial processes.\n\nIn Southern China, the Pearl River delta has a high level of toxic accumulation because the area has heavy production facilities which provide 30% of China’s exports. The rivers serves as source of water supply to 47 million people yet still continues to be a dumping site. TURA’s guideline are being used in China to account for the toxic waste in the river and to come up with solution to reduce it. In a study conducted in Thailand, it was concluded that implementing a tax policy can greatly reduce toxicity emissions. The main concern is to ensure that the lower and middle-class families don’t get affected by these policies, thus progressive toxic emission strategy should be enforced where taxation depends on much toxicity an individual or a family produces. n Argentina’s Rio Chuela area, there are around 4100 factories. The toxic emissions are so high that the river is turning black. After a lawsuit from the Citizen’s Action, the court directed factories to reduce the toxic emissions by 50% over five years. To achieve this goal, TURA’s guidelines have been effective in helping the Argentinian government build a framework for its industrial sector.\n\nThere has been a push to focus on the upstream production process to reduce toxins. The idea is to regulate emissions in the early phase of the production process rather than controlling pollution results once the toxins are released into the environment. Governments, private companies and local communities are being brought together to find ways to reduce pollution output rather than pollution control. For example, private companies such as PaperWorks Packaging Group from Ontario, Canada have taken initiative to reduce toxic elements in the production process. The company was using toxic materials in the cleaning solutions which would escape into the atmosphere. The company decided to eliminate the Stoddard solvent from its production process to produce high quality products that are environmentally responsible.\n\nHowever, there has been hesitation to wholeheartedly follow these toxics use reduction programs from a business standpoint. While some businesses found that by switching to a different chemical instead of the toxic ones, some other companies have not changed their production processes or invested in ways to reduce toxic chemical usage because they are unsure if they will make a large enough profit. Some businesses claim that it is too costly to run a business using alternative chemicals. Other reasons why businesses have not necessarily switched over to a different alternative chemical in lieu of the toxic one could be a lack of knowledge that an alternative exists or the fact that the alternative may not have been created yet.\n\n"}

The Lord Lyon King of Arms who is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in that country, issuing new grants of coats of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, recognizes under Scottish law the Chief of Clan MacDougall. The MacDougall chiefs share a common ancestry with the chiefs of Clan Donald in descent from Somerled of the 12th century. In the 13th century the Clan MacDougall whose chiefs were the original Lords of Argyll and later Lords of Lorne was the most powerful clan in the Western Highlands. During the Wars of Scottish Independence the MacDougalls sided with the Clan Comyn whose chiefs rivaled Robert the Bruce for the Scottish Crown and this resulted in clan battles between the MacDougalls and Bruce. This marked the MacDougall's fall from power and led to the rise of their relatives, the Clan Donald, who had supported Bruce and also the rise to power of the Clan Campbell who were the habitual enemies of the MacDougalls and Clan Donald.\n\nThe MacDougalls supported the House of Stuart during the Scottish Civil War of the 17th century and during the Jacobite risings of the 18th century.\n\nThe Clan MacDougall takes its name from Dougall, the son of Somerled. After Somerled's death at the Battle of Renfrew in 1164, Dougall held most of Argyll as well as the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and others.\n\nThe Celtic first name Dougall, or Dugald is derived from the Gaelic \"dubh-gall\", which means \"black stranger\". Dougall's royal descent was acknowledged by the king of Norway and Dougall himself was styled as 'King of the South Isles and Lord of Lorne'. One of Dougall's sons seems to have been Óspakr-Hákon, a man installed as King of the Isles by Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway in 1230. A certain son of Dougall was Duncan, who was in turn the father of Ewan. Duncan and Ewan built many castles to defend their territory. These included Dunstaffnage Castle, Dunollie Castle and Duntrune Castle on the main land. Whilst on the islands they built Aros Castle, Cairnburgh Castle, Dunchonnel Castle and Coeffin Castle. Dunollie Castle is believed to have been fortified since the 6th century and became the seat of the chief of Clan MacDougall. Duncan also built Ardchattan Priory and it was here that the MacDougall chiefs were buried until 1737.\n\nEwan's possessions on the islands were held from the king of Norway, whilst his possessions on the mainland were held from the king of Scotland. This made it hard for him to remain loyal to both. In 1263 Haakon IV of Norway arrived with a huge fleet off the coast of Oban for an invasion of the west coast of Scotland. However, Ewan decided not to join the invasion and thanks to old blood ties Haakon left him in peace. The Battle of Largs then took place and Ewan joined the side of Scots and attacked part of the Norse fleet. The Vikings were utterly defeated and three years later Norway ceded all of the Hebrides to Scotland.\n\nThe MacDougall's influence in Argyll brought them into conflict with the Clan Campbell. In 1294 John MacDougall of Argyll led the Clan MacDougall against the Clan Campbell at the Battle of Red Ford, where Sir Colin Campbell was killed but there were considerable losses on both sides.\n\nThe fourth chief of Clan MacDougall married a sister of John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (the \"Black Comyn\"), whose son, John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (the \"Red Comyn\") was stabbed to death by Robert the Bruce in the church of Greyfriars in Dumfries in 1306, and this brought the MacDougalls into conflict with the Bruces. The MacDougalls who had supported William Wallace in the cause of Scottish independence now found themselves in a blood feud with the Clan Bruce, whose cause was also of Scottish Independence. Shortly after Robert the Bruce's coronation at Scone he was forced by the English to retreat into Argyll, in an attempt to reach his Clan Campbell allies. However, the Clan MacDougall surprised the Bruce and defeated him in what was known as the Battle of Dalrigh. The king escaped but left behind what was described as a magnificent example of Celtic jewellery, known as the \"Brooch of Lorne\" and it became one of the Clan MacDougall's great treasures. Three years later Robert the Bruce led three thousand battle hardened veterans into Argyll against the MacDougalls. John MacDougall of Lorne set an ambush for them but in the ensuing Battle of the Pass of Brander the MacDougalls were defeated and forced to flee. The MacDougalls' lands were then forfeited by the king and he gave them to the Campbells for their loyalty.\n\nAlthough the power of the MacDougalls was never regained, their fortunes were restored somewhat under John MacDougall's grandson, John Gallda MacDougall, Lord of Lorne. In the mid-14th century, the latter relocated from England to Scotland, married a niece of the reigning David II, King of Scotland, and regained the clan's ancestral lands in Lorne. Most of their mainland lands were then returned in a royal charter from David II of Scotland. Although the lordship of Lorne eventually passed into the hands of the Stewarts following John Gallda's death, the MacDougall chiefly line preserved through his son Allan.\n\nIn 1468 the Clan MacDougall fought against the Clan Stewart of Appin at the Battle of Stalc.\n\nDuring the civil war of the 17th century the MacDougalls were generally royalists and chief Alexander MacDougall led five hundred of his clansmen into battle. However, after the defeat of the royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, a Covenanter army, led by David Leslie, Lord Newark was sent into Argyll to deal with royalist supporters. The MacDougalls lands were restored however, after the restoration on the monarchy in 1660.\n\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Clan MacDougall supported the Jacobite cause and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir after which the chief was forced into exile but later returned to Scotland to live as a fugitive. He was pardoned in 1727.\n\nHis son and next chief, Alexander MacDougall did not take part in the Jacobite rising of 1745. However, his brother and some of the clansmen did indeed fight as Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The fighting force of the clan at this time is given as 200 men.\n\nThe current chief of the clan is Morag Morley MacDougall of MacDougall and Dunollie. She is a daughter of the sister of the previous clan chief, Coline Helen Elizabeth MacDougall of MacDougall and Dunollie. The latter was in turn a daughter of the previous chief, Alexander James MacDougall of Dunollie. The chief of Clan MacDougall represents the senior line of Somerled's descendants.\n\nThe chief's coat of arms is blazoned: \"Quarterly, 1st and 4th, azure, a lion rampant argent; 2nd and 3rd, or, a galley sails furled sable, surmounted of a beacon gules\". This coat of arms specifically dates to 1931, and is very similar to one inscribed upon an 18th-century tombstone in the chiefs' Kilbride burial ground.\n\nCastles built or owned by the Clan MacDougall have included amongst many others:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It also speaks to optimization of such processes, charging for them as well as estimating future requirements, sometimes called capacity planning.\n\nOver the past several decades (leading up to 2005), organizations (banks, governments, schools, manufacturers and others) have increased their reliance more on \"Open Systems\" and less on \"Closed Systems\". For example, 25 years ago, a large bank might have most if not all of its critical data housed in an IBM mainframe computer (a \"Closed System\"), but today, that same bank might store a substantially greater portion of its critical data in spreadsheets, databases, or even word processing documents (i.e., \"Open Systems\"). The problem with Open Systems is, primarily, their unpredictable nature. The very nature of an Open System is that it is exposed to potentially thousands if not millions of variables ranging from network overloads to computer virus attacks to simple software incompatibility. Any one, or indeed several in combination, of these factors may result in either lost data and/or compromised data backup attempts. These types of problems do not generally occur on Closed Systems, or at least, in unpredictable ways. In the \"old days\", backups were a nicely contained affair. Today, because of the ubiquity of, and dependence upon, Open Systems, an entire industry has developed around data protection. Three key elements of such data protection are Validation, Optimization and Chargeback.\n\nValidation is the process of finding out whether a backup attempt succeeded or not, or, whether the data is backed up enough to consider it \"protected\". This process usually involves the examination of log files, the \"smoking gun\" often left behind after a backup attempts takes place, as well as media databases, data traffic and even magnetic tapes. Patterns can be detected, key error messages identified and statistics extracted in order to determine which backups worked and which did not. According to Veeam Availability Report in 2014 organizations test their backups for recoverability on average every eight days. However, each quarter, organizations only test an average of 5.26 percent of their backups, meaning that the vast majority of backups are not verified,so could fail and cause downtime.\n\nOptimization is the process of examining productivity patterns in the process of backup to determine where improvements can be made and often, where certain (less important) backup jobs may be eliminated entirely.\n\nVery often, the service of backing up data is done by one person (or persons) in the service of others, the Owners of the data. Becoming more prevalent today also is the charging for those services back to the data Owner(s). A simple fee per backup might be agreed upon, or, as is more often the case, a complex charge based on success rates, speed, size, frequency and retention (how long the copy is kept) is put into place. Usually some form of service level agreement (SLA) is in place between the backup service provider and the data owner in which it is agreed what is to be done and how the service is to be charged for.\n\n"}

It was invented by Hugh C. Williams in 1982. \n\nIt works well if the number \"N\" to be factored contains one or more prime factors \"p\" such that \"p\" + 1 is smooth, i.e. \"p\" + 1 contains only small factors. It uses Lucas sequences to perform exponentiation in a quadratic field.\n\nIt is analogous to Pollard's \"p\" − 1 algorithm.\n\nChoose some integer \"A\" greater than 2 which characterizes the Lucas sequence:\n\nwhere all operations are performed modulo \"N\".\n\nThen any odd prime \"p\" divides formula_2 whenever \"M\" is a multiple of formula_3, where \nformula_4 and \nformula_5 is the Jacobi symbol.\n\nWe require that formula_6, that is, \"D\" should be a quadratic non-residue modulo \"p\". But as we don't know \"p\" beforehand, more than one value of \"A\" may be required before finding a solution. If formula_7, this algorithm degenerates into a slow version of Pollard's p − 1 algorithm.\n\nSo, for different values of \"M\" we calculate formula_2, and when the result is not equal to 1 or to \"N\", we have found a non-trivial factor of \"N\".\n\nThe values of \"M\" used are successive factorials, and formula_9 is the \"M\"-th value of the sequence characterized by formula_10.\n\nTo find the \"M\"-th element \"V\" of the sequence characterized by \"B\", we proceed in a manner similar to left-to-right exponentiation:\n\nWith \"N\"=112729 and \"A\"=5, successive values of formula_9 are:\n\nAt this point, gcd(110229-2,112729) = 139, so 139 is a non-trivial factor of 112729. Notice that p+1 = 140 = 2 × 5 × 7. The number 7! is the lowest factorial which is multiple of 140, so the proper factor 139 is found in this step.\n\nUsing another initial value, say \"A\" = 9, we get:\n\nAt this point gcd(91645-2,112729) = 811, so 811 is a non-trivial factor of 112729. Notice that p−1 = 810 = 2 × 5 × 3. The number 9! is the lowest factorial which is multiple of 810, so the proper factor 811 is found in this step. The factor 139 is not found this time because p−1 = 138 = 2 × 3 × 23 which is not a divisor of 9!\n\nAs can be seen in these examples we do not know in advance whether the prime that will be found has a smooth p+1 or p−1.\n\nBased on Pollard's \"p\" − 1 and Williams's \"p\"+1 factoring algorithms, Eric Bach and Jeffrey Shallit developed techniques to factor \"n\" efficiently provided that it has a prime factor \"p\" such that any \"k\" cyclotomic polynomial Φ(\"p\") is smooth.\nThe first few cyclotomic polynomials are given by the sequence Φ(\"p\") = \"p\"−1, Φ(\"p\") = \"p\"+1, Φ(\"p\") = \"p\"+\"p\"+1, and Φ(\"p\") = \"p\"+1.\n\n\n"}

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\nThe company was founded in 1867 as an operator of wharves and warehouses on the south bank of the River Thames. The name can be traced to Alexander Hay, who acquired a brewhouse there in 1651. It was redeveloped as a 'wharf', in fact an enclosed dock, in 1856 and renamed Hay's Wharf. It was rebuilt after the 1861 Tooley Street fire and still stands; it was converted in the 1980s into a shopping and restaurant area known as Hay's Galleria. \n\nThe Kuwait Investment Authority acquired an indirect 34% holding in the company in 1975, increased to 100% in 1980, chiefly to acquire the property assets on the south bank of the Thames, which were sold to St Martins Property Group in the early 1980s.\nTo develop the management team for the services group, the Kuwaitis backed Hays' acquisition of Farmhouse Securities, a food distribution business owned by Ronnie Frost, and Hays then moved into chemical distribution and office support services with Frost and Peter David Thatcher Roberts as CEO. In 1986, it purchased a personnel business called Career Care Group, which had been founded by Denis Waxman. Hays was also growing its business storage services which included the brands \"Hays Wharf\" and \"Rentacrate\". In 1987, a long-planned management buyout was completed, and the company launched an initial public offering in 1989. Ronnie Frost managed the combined services group from 1987 until he retired in 2001.\n\nIn March 2003, Hays announced that, following a strategic review, it intended to reposition itself purely as a specialist recruitment business and that the company would dispose of all non-core business, including its commercial and logistics operations. Following Hays' change of focus to a recruitment company, Denis Waxman became CEO in July 2004. In November 2004 Hays de-merged its DX delivery network which represented the final step in the transformation of Hays into a recruitment business. In November 2007 Waxman retired and was succeeded by Alistair Cox.\n\nHays is a specialist recruitment group with operations in the UK, Continental Europe (in Germany pronounced Hei(s), as health=Hei(l)), the America and Asia Pacific regions. It has a fairly equal balance of work in temporary and permanent recruitment, which contributes to financial stability through business cycles. Hays operates in 33 countries.\n\nIn 2009 the Office of Fair Trading imposed a £30.4m fine against Hays for its involvement in price-fixing. The firm, along with five other recruitment firms, formed a cartel called the Construction Recruitment Forum which agreed to boycott Parc, a new company that had entered the market in 2003 to act as an intermediary between construction firms and recruitment firms. The six firms received fines totalling £39.3m, Hays receiving the biggest fine. Hays had its fine cut by the Competition Appeal Tribunal from £30.4m to £5.9m following an appeal against the level of a fine imposed by the Office of Fair Trading in September 2009.\n"}

The PC and Sega CD versions have digitized stadium photos. The Genesis version carried the PolyGram Video logo across the stadium advertisement boards in the game.\n\nThis was the last official FIFA World Cup franchise game before Electronic Arts acquired the rights in 1996 for the \"FIFA Soccer\" series.\n\nThe game is viewed from a bird's eye-view perspective. Game time may be customised from as short as a minute per half to the full regular 45 minutes. A coin toss is determined by the 'home' team and play will commence. Depending on the options set before the match, the gamer may opt to have less dribble control (resulting in the game ball sliding in the direction of the player movement); manual goalkeeper control which puts the player in control of all goalkeeper saves and kicks; ball-trapping, of which the player will not be able to shield the ball and allows opponents to snatch it away without necessitating a tackle; and no pass-back rule which was implemented during World Cup '94 where a keeper may not pick up the ball whenever an outfield player passes it back to him.\n\nIf the gamer opts for manual goalkeeper control, the player would have to make a save by guessing where the opponent will place the ball and jumping into the general direction with any of the console buttons and the directional keys if applicable. Similarly, outfield players have the option to either pass the ball, kick it (when attempting to score a goal) or attempt a lob. Freekicks may also be executed using any of the above. However, a penalty kick is done in a different game screen similar to that of World Cup 98 (video game) and where a hovering indicator swings from side to side to indicate the direction of the shot.\n\nBasic tactics (or preset tactics) can also be customised prior to the game and may be changed in-game. Team rosters, while not based on real-life players, have variable attributes amongst its players and divided into three major skills which are speed, dribble control and shooting accuracy. Goalkeepers do not have a separate skill evaluation method and can be picked from normal players.\n\nQualified teams:\n\nTeams that did not qualify:\n\n\"GamePro\" praised the SNES version's controls, sound effects, and \"amazing range of options\", though they criticized the graphics.

Pratt placed fifth in a high school state wrestling tournament; he later recalled that when his wrestling coach asked him what he wished to do with his life, he said \"'I don't know, but I know I'll be famous and I know I'll make a shit ton of money.' I had no idea how. I'd done nothing proactive.\" He graduated from Lake Stevens High School in 1997.\n\nPratt dropped out of community college halfway through the first semester and, after working as a discount ticket salesman and daytime stripper, he ended up homeless in Maui, Hawaii, sleeping in a van and a tent on the beach. He told \"The Independent\", \"It's a pretty awesome place to be homeless. We just drank and smoked weed and worked minimal hours, just enough to cover gas, food, and fishing supplies.\" He recalled listening to the Dr. Dre album \"2001\" daily, to the point where he knew every lyric; years later, he rapped Eminem's verses from the song \"Forgot About Dre\" extemporaneously during an interview.

When he felt he had lost enough, he sent a photo of himself to the casting director and won the part.

Pratt also won over Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, despite having gained weight again for the comedy film \"Delivery Man\". The role was part of a multi-film deal that Pratt signed with Marvel. Bruce Diones of \"The New Yorker\" noted, \"Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays the leader of the pack of misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for seventies music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects.\"\n\nIn November 2013, Pratt, an avid fan of \"Jurassic Park\", who has referred to that film as \"my \"Star Wars\"\", replaced Josh Brolin as the lead in the film \"Jurassic World\" (2015).

Histories written down in the early colonial period portray Tezozomoc as a military and political genius who oversaw an expansion of Tepanec influence, bringing about Azcapotzalco's dominance in the Valley of Mexico and beyond.\n\nTezozomoc was a son of Acolnahuacatzin and Cuetlaxochitzin. He is described by Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl as a tyrant and: \"the most cruel man who ever lived, proud, warlike and domineering. And he was so old, according to what appears in the histories, and to what elderly princes have told me, that they carried him about like a child swathed in feathers and soft skins; they always took him out into the sun to warm him up, and at night he slept between two great braziers, and he never withdrew from their glow because he lacked natural heat. And he was very temperate in his eating and drinking and for this reason he lived so long.\"\n\nHe approved the choice of King Huitzilihuitl in 1403 and gave him his daughter Ayauhcihuatl in marriage, notwithstanding the opposition of his son Maxtla.
