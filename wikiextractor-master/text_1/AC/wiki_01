She is best known for her role as Charlotte King on the ABC drama \"Private Practice\" (2007–2013).\n\nStrickland began acting during high school. She studied acting in Philadelphia and New York City, where she obtained mostly small roles in film, television, and stage projects, among them \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999). Her participation in the 2003 Hollywood films \"Anything Else\" and \"Something's Gotta Give\" led to her receiving significant parts in the 2004 horror films \"\" and \"The Grudge\". She was then referred to as \"the pride of Patterson\" and the horror genre's \"newest scream queen\", though her performances in both films received mixed critical reviews. In 2005, she garnered positive critical reviews for the romantic comedy \"Fever Pitch\", and she was a regular on the television show \"The Wedding Bells\" in 2007. She was subsequently added to the cast of \"Private Practice\".\n\nStrickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde actresses. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She has also worked closely with RAINN after participating in a storyline in which her \"Private Practice\" character was raped.\n\nKatherine Dee Strickland was born in Blackshear, Georgia, on December 14, 1975, to Susan, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school football coach, principal, and superintendent. Her nickname comes from her parents combining the \"K\" in her first name with her father's name (and also her middle name) to make \"KaDee\". She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she referred to as a \"one-stoplight town\", and she had a job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film \"Annie Hall\" (1975) and was \"wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people [...] [she] wanted to be in it\". During her childhood, she was well known locally as a member of the Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements; she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle, and high school, as well as the student council president and a cheerleader. She never considered a career in the arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: \"The minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I was here to do.\"\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Strickland wanted to study drama at college in New York City, but her parents did not want her to live in such a large city so soon. She instead applied to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. During her studies there, she joined the Screen Actors Guild and considered using her given name as the first part of her stage name, before deciding she was \"much too tomboy\" for it. She took a part-time job as a waitress at a local restaurant and interned at a casting agency, where one of her tasks was to read lines at auditions for small roles in local film and television projects; the job landed Strickland her first film role. After graduating from university with a fine arts degree, she was schooled in New York City, and she moved to Los Angeles in late 2003. In 2006, she received the University of the Arts's Silver Star Alumni Award.\n\nStrickland's career began in 1999 with a brief appearance as a mourner at a funeral after-party in \"The Sixth Sense\", a two-line part that she received after impressing writer-director M. Night Shyamalan when reading lines for those auditioning for the film. According to Strickland, her role in the film helped her learn to temper her fake crying. The same year, she served as an extra in the independent film \"The Sterling Chase\", and appeared in a small role opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie in James Mangold's drama \"Girl, Interrupted\".\n\nWhen staying in Philadelphia, Strickland had opportunities to take part in other films in production in and around the city. Those included Rel Dowdell's \"Train Ride\", a date rape thriller filmed in 1998, but not commercially released until 2005 because of financing problems. She was also cast in the crime drama \"Diamond Men\" with Robert Forster and Donnie Wahlberg; it opened to sparkling reviews, with Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" declaring it \"a fantastic film, with a good cast\". After she moved to New York City, Strickland appeared in Adam Bhala Lough's filmmaking debut, \"Bomb the System\", which received unenthusiastic notices from critics and was not shown outside film festivals until 2005.\n\nConcurrent to her film work, Strickland acquired stage experience in productions such as \"A Requiem for Things Past\" in mid-1999, and John Patrick Shanley's \"Women of Manhattan\". She acted in a December 2002 episode of the television show \"\" and made nine guest appearances on \"All My Children\", which enabled her to leave her waitressing job. In 2003, Strickland was cast opposite Eddie Cibrian in the pilot episode for an uncommissioned small screen serial adaptation of John Grisham's novel \"The Street Lawyer\".\n\nStrickland appeared in two romantic comedy films in 2003. \"Anything Else\", written and directed by Woody Allen, featured her as the girlfriend of Jason Biggs's character (whom he snubs for Christina Ricci's Amanda Chase); she said it was a \"dream come true\" to work with Allen, of whom she is an \"obsessive diehard\" fan. The film was greeted with lukewarm reviews and dismal ticket sales, though Strickland later referred to it as her \"big break\". The second, \"Something's Gotta Give\" (starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton), was a major critical and commercial success, though Strickland's part in the film was brief. She played the girlfriend of Keaton's character's ex-husband (played by Paul Michael Glaser), a relationship involving age disparity that raised the eyebrows of Keaton and her daughter (Amanda Peet). The following year, she made brief appearances in the direct-to-cable independent film \"Knots\" and the poorly received satirical comedy \"The Stepford Wives\" with Nicole Kidman, playing a partygoer and a game show contestant, respectively.\n\nStrickland's first lead role came when producer Doug Belgrad saw the dailies of her scene in \"Something's Gotta Give\". He cast her opposite Johnny Messner and Morris Chestnut in the jungle-set horror film \"\", the sequel to \"Anaconda\" (1997). Strickland played an accomplished research scientist who travels to Borneo as part of an expedition team searching for a species of plant rumored to have life-extending properties. She said she initially did not want to follow a Woody Allen film with a \"\"snake\" movie\", but that she changed her mind because the hero was a female Southerner who was not \"a complete idiot\" or \"a chick in shorts about to get whacked\". Though its box office revenue tripled its production budget, \"Anacondas\" did not perform as well as its predecessor, and most reviews panned the project. The cast received positive comment from \"Variety\" magazine and the \"Chicago Sun-Times\"'s Roger Ebert, but a critic for the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" said the film was \"so stupidly plotted and badly acted, it becomes unintentionally funny\", and described Strickland and her co-stars' work as \"garden-variety bad\". Other reviews focussed on the attractiveness of Strickland and her castmates; \"Slant Magazine\" said \"[the film is] populated with anonymous, attractive plastic people from the Los Angeles talent pool.\" During the same period, \"The Florida Times-Union\" referred to her as \"the pride of Patterson\".\n\nStrickland's next project, \"The Grudge\", was another horror film. In Japanese director Takashi Shimizu's U.S. remake of his film \"\" (2003), Strickland played (in a role originated by Misaki Ito) a Tokyo-based American businesswoman whose relatives emigrate from the U.S. Strickland received the role through a casting session with producer Sam Raimi, who picked her based on her work in footage for the then-unreleased \"Anacondas\", and her willingness to work away from home for extended periods. She said that Japan and Japanese cinema had always fascinated her, and that she wanted to be \"a part of that world\" in which filmmakers communicate the story via action rather than dialogue; she also highlighted the importance of being \"able to explore being in the wrong place at the wrong time without being a sex object/damsel in distress.\" \"The Grudge\" was a number-one U.S. box office hit and quickly became one of the year's most profitable films, but reviews were lukewarm. \"The Charlotte Observer\" wrote \"the cast is drab and lifeless\", and earned \"nothing but demerits\". Strickland's presence in \"The Grudge\" and \"Anacondas\" led horror fans to name her \"[their] newest scream queen\", but she said that when deciding what film to do next, she did not focus as much on genre as she did on good characters, scripts, and directors, which she said \"don't come around that often.\" For the scene in which her character hides under her bed covers, Strickland received a 2005 Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice Movie Scary Scene.\n\nIn late 2004, Strickland embarked on what she called \"the craziest job I've ever had\": a role in the Farrelly brothers film \"Fever Pitch\", a baseball-themed romantic comedy starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon (Strickland's \"Anything Else\" co-star) and based on the Nick Hornby book. Strickland said it was \"a blast\" to play \"such a maniac\", particularly after playing emotionally traumatised characters in \"Anacondas\" and \"The Grudge\". On the film's 2005 release, she received praise from \"PopMatters\" magazine, which described her as \"irrepressible\" in her role, and from MSNBC, which said she and JoBeth Williams \"sometimes rescue [the picture] from its plodding moments\". The film raised Strickland's profile further, though its critical response was mixed and it performed moderately at the box office. Strickland appeared as a lawyer and love interest in the film \"American Gangster\", which stars Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington in 2007. In 2008, she played Jillian Cartwright in the film \"The Family That Preys\".\n\nIn early 2005, Strickland was cast in the pilot episode for the fact-based ABC television series \"Laws of Chance\". It was based on the career of Kelly Siegler, a highly successful Houston, Texas-based assistant district attorney. Strickland, whose co-stars in the pilot included Frances Fisher and Bruce McGill, said she was \"really excited to have the opportunity to portray this phenomenal lady\", but the series was dropped from development a few months later. Strickland was also cast in the independently financed 1950s-set film \"Walker Payne\" as laid-off stripminer Jason Patric's love interest; in a review of the film at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, \"Variety\" wrote that Strickland was \"elegant\". In late 2005, she joined the cast of \"The Flock\", a crime drama featuring Richard Gere, Claire Danes and singer Avril Lavigne about a federal agent assigned to track down a missing girl and a paroled sex offender (played by Strickland). Strickland said it was important to participate in such a story because she felt members of society need to consider and be responsible for their views on the sex offender counterculture, which she says \"[is] actually not counter at all, it's very real, very next door to you.\"\n\nStrickland's first aired television project as a cast regular was the David E. Kelley-produced series \"The Wedding Bells\". According to her, she wanted to be in the series because \"the subject of love and commitment is something to me that I want to walk into every day. It's a lot better than dead bodies.\" The show began airing on the Fox Network in March 2007, and it was canceled the following month. The \"Baltimore Sun\" called it \"awful in ways that make the word 'awful' seem inadequate [...] [the cast is] not a bad one at all, but just terrifically ill-served by the material.\" She joined the cast of the \"Grey's Anatomy\" spin-off \"Private Practice\", which began airing in September 2007; and portrayed Charlotte King, chief of staff at the show's local hospital and a doctor specializing in urologic surgery, and later sexology. In 2016, she joined the series \"Shut Eye\" as Linda Haverford, the wife of lead character Charlie (played by Jeffrey Donovan). It was cancelled in January 30, 2018 after two seasons. \n\nIn 1996, Strickland appeared briefly in the music video for Oasis's \"Don't Look Back In Anger\". In 2009, Strickland appeared in the music video for Rascal Flatts's \"Here Comes Goodbye\".\n\nStrickland has cited Jessica Lange, Holly Hunter, Diane Keaton (in \"Annie Hall\"), Ione Skye (her \"Fever Pitch\" co-star) and Jane Fonda as her inspirations and/or influences; for \"The Grudge\", she mimicked Fonda's performance in \"Klute\" (1971) and her \"brilliant way in that film of creating tension and fear for the audience just by walking down a hallway and looking over her shoulder.\" She noted the input of her acting coach, Maggie Flanagan, who instructed Strickland to watch films with the sound turned off to gauge the quality and comprehensibility of a performance, and who Strickland credits as her \"Jedi Knight\".\n\nStrickland cites her work ethic and her \"active imagination\" as sources of inspiration when she is required to convey certain emotions, particularly negative ones. She said she does not practise method acting, but that actors can bring to a role elements that are, in her words, \"an extension of [their] life experience\". According to her, she hopes to have her experience of growing up in an emotionally warm environment incorporated into her work. Strickland has spoken of her difficulty conveying different \"versions\" of emotions such as fear to different members of a worldwide film-watching audience, saying \"what really kept me going was trying to communicate something universal.\" She said she is extremely flattered when people, particularly her fans, genuinely relate to her when her \"version of storytelling\" and work as an actress communicates to them. She said she believed she was \"here\" to act, and that she could not live without it: \"It's my joy, it's what I love, and there's no feeling like being able to do what you love in life, and really fully doing it\", she said. Strickland called her life as an actress \"a crazy existence\" and \"completely unstable\" because of the frequency with which she has to look for new jobs, but she said she is \"gonna be whole hog with it\" and continue to act until her death.\n\nStrickland is a self-described \"big fashionista\" and \"very concerned with looks\", and has noted the need for \"an element of vanity\" in acting, particularly in Los Angeles, where she says she is \"continually surrounded by super-human people\" and has \"never seen so much beauty\". She says she has never had to rely on her appearance or felt pressured to be beautiful. With regard to sources such as magazines, Strickland said she is \"very careful\" about the way she wants to be presented as a woman, saying she strives to avoid \"sensationalizing or sexualizing\" herself. As she put it, she is not accustomed to being considered a \"pretty girl\" or \"attractive by a standard that [she's] never felt that [she] was part of\". She has a very noticeable Southern American accent, which she says is an advantage for her because it is \"the one thing\" that film and casting directors like the sound of and \"really gravitate toward\", particularly in Los Angeles, which she called \"a town full of blondes\". According to her, she learned to speak without the accent at university; because she does not want people to think she has no other skills, she uses it only when it is required or requested. She is experienced in stage combat and has said she \"like[s] to do physical stuff\". In an interview to discuss \"Anacondas\", she said, \"If there was a \"Braveheart\" for women, I'd be all over it.\"\n\nStrickland met fellow actor Jason Behr on the set of \"The Grudge\" in 2004. According to her, they shared an affinity for Japanese culture and became friends almost instantly. The two began a relationship soon after filming ended. When asked about her love life in February 2005, Strickland said it was \"quiet\". On November 10, 2006, she married Behr in Ojai, California, in a ceremony inspired by Japanese culture. Strickland said her experience planning the wedding aided her preparation for her role in \"The Wedding Bells\". Her work on the wedding provided the inspiration for the wedding garden of Casa de Estrellas (House of Stars), a luxury inn and spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Behr proposed to her on her birthday. They have a son named Atticus Elijah Behr (born October 17, 2013).\n\nIn 2004, before the release of \"Anacondas\", Strickland hosted the art debut of fellow actress Heidi Jayne Netzley at the Edgemar Center for the Arts in Santa Monica, California. She was among the actors who picketed alongside writers during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. She also works closely with the anti-sexual assault organization RAINN. When \"Private Practice\" creator Shonda Rhimes wrote a storyline in which Strickland's character was assaulted and raped, Strickland turned to RAINN to ensure that her portrayal was true to life. Through her work for this storyline, Strickland felt a personal connection with RAINN and decided to become an advocate. Since then, she has spoken out for the elimination of the backlog of untested DNA evidence and has become a vocal advocate for using DNA evidence to solve rape cases. She also worked with Gorjana to create an exclusive piece of jewelry for RAINN, in which 80% of the sale price goes directly to the organization.\n"}

One explanation for this is that the word \"taketh\" does not necessarily refer to a physical transportation, it could mean that Satan merely took Jesus in a vision. John Calvin supported this view, and the Geneva Bible made this interpretation explicit. Clarke lists several other explanation that have been given for this statement:\nClark notes that the mountain setting evokes pagan mythology, which often had to gods atop mountains of extreme height. The most famous example being Mount Olympus of the Greeks. The deuterocanonical Book of Baruch also mentions a mountain from where all the kingdoms of the Earth can be seen.\n\nNolland contrasts the\"kingdoms of the world\" to the \"Kingdom of Heaven\" that is mentioned throughout the Gospel, one being the kingdom of Satan and the other the kingdom of God.\n\nThis verse is often considered to be a reference to , where God instructs Moses to climb Mount Nebo and shows him Jericho and Canaan and promises them to the Israelites.

This condition is one of the four basic categories of disruption of acid–base homeostasis.\n\nSigns and symptoms of respiratory alkalosis are as follows:\n\nRespiratory alkalosis may be produced as a result of the following causes:\n\nThe mechanism of respiratory alkalosis generally occurs when some stimulus makes a person hyperventilate. The increased breathing produces increased alveolar respiration, expelling CO from the circulation. This alters the dynamic chemical equilibrium of carbon dioxide in the circulatory system. Circulating hydrogen ions and bicarbonate are shifted through the carbonic acid (HCO) intermediate to make more CO via the enzyme carbonic anhydrase according to the following reaction: formula_1 This causes decreased circulating hydrogen ion concentration, and increased pH (alkalosis).\n\nThe diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis is done via test that measure the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels (in the blood), chest x-ray and a pulmonary function test of the individual.\n\nThe Davenport diagram allows clinicians or investigators to outline blood bicarbonate concentrations (and blood pH) after a respiratory or metabolic acid-base disturbance\n\nThere are two types of respiratory alkalosis: chronic and acute as a result of the 3–5 day delay in kidney compensation of the abnormality.\n\n\nRespiratory alkalosis is very rarely life-threatening, though pH level should not be 7.5 or greater. The aim in treatment is to detect the underlying cause. When PaCO2 is adjusted rapidly in individuals with chronic respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis may occur. If the individual is on a mechanical ventilator then preventing hyperventilation is done via monitoring ABG levels.\n\nIn \"The Andromeda Strain\", one of the characters is exposed to contamination, but saves himself by increasing his respiratory rate to induce alkalosis.\n"}

McNutt\n\nPaul Vories McNutt (July 19, 1891 – March 24, 1955) was an American diplomat and politician who served as the 34th governor of Indiana, high commissioner to the Philippines, administrator of the Federal Security Agency, chairman of the War Manpower Commission and ambassador to the Philippines.\n\nPaul Vories McNutt was born in Franklin, Indiana on July 19, 1891, the only child of John C. and Ruth McNutt. Both his parents were school teachers when they met, but his father began practicing just before he was born. The family moved to Indianapolis in 1893 where his father had become librarian of the Indiana Supreme Court. McNutt was enrolled in public school in the city and attended for two years. In 1898 his father resigned his position and they moved again to Martinsville where he opened a law office. McNutt was moved to a local school where he attended until graduation.\n\nIn 1909, McNutt entered Indiana University where he was active in campus politics, acted in student theater productions and was a close friend and Beta Theta Pi fraternity brother of Wendell Willkie, future Republican candidate for president of the United States who, like McNutt, was then a Democrat. After graduating from Indiana in 1913, McNutt went to Harvard Law School where he became a member of Acacia fraternity as well as taking an extracurricular job as a United Press reporter and sports writer. McNutt took his law degree from Harvard in 1916, then returned to Martinsville where in a race for Morgan County prosecutor he was narrowly defeated.\n\nThe following year he took a job as assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Law, but quit to enlist in the United States Army when the United States entered World War I. McNutt completed officer candidate school at Fort Benjamin Harrison, and received his commission in the field artillery branch. He was assigned to provide instruction in field artillery skills, and served at Camp Travis, Kelly Field, and Camp Stanley, Texas and Fort Jackson, South Carolina. While in Texas, he met and married his wife, Kathleen. He was discharged as a major in 1919, and later joined the reserves, where he rose to the rank of colonel.\n\nAfter leaving active military service, McNutt returned to his law school teaching job, becoming a full professor in 1920 and then, in 1925, the youngest dean in the school's history. He skillfully used both his university connections and his wartime experience to launch his political career. As law school dean, he forcefully attacked pacifists and opponents of compulsory military training on college campuses. He had since returning from the war been active in The American Legion, an influential veterans' organization, and spoke frequently throughout the state. In 1927, he was elected commander of the Indiana department of The American Legion. His group's lobbying brought him contact with many state leaders which began his interest in politics and began building a political base of support.\n\nMcNutt became chairman of the state party and led the Indiana delegation to the Democratic National Convention in 1932. Up until the very last ballot, he and the delegation refused to support the nomination of Franklin D. Roosevelt for President. McNutt was dismissive and rude to Roosevelt when he came to personally ask for their support. Roosevelt never forgot the slight, and from then on in private he referred to McNutt as \"that platinum blond S.O.B from Indiana.\"\n\nThe same year, Indiana's Democrats nominated McNutt for governor at the state convention. In the general campaign he focused his attacks on Republicans by blaming them for doing too little to resolve the problems of the Great Depression. His campaign created the first political club for supporters in the United States. Members could join for a small fee with the contributions going to the campaign. The idea became popular and is now employed in many campaigns nationwide. He won easily, swept along in that year's national Democratic landslide led by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Democrats swept the Indiana General Assembly as well, taking 91 out of 100 house seats, and 43 of the 50 senate seats.\n\nMcNutt was a forceful and controversial governor. With an overwhelming Democratic majority in the legislature, he completely reorganized state government with the passage of the Executive Reorganization Act. The act effectively rolled back over fifty years of restrictions the legislation had placed on the governor in appointing officials, in having control over policy, giving him a measure of control over the more independent branches of the administration, and also granting new and expanded powers to the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana.\n\nTo remedy the state funding problem, he was able to have constitutional amendments passed that legalized a gross income tax. Previously almost all state revenue had come from property tax which fell disproportionately on farmers and rural citizens, while since the 1920s the majority of citizens were living in Indiana's cities. In the city, most people owned much less property, leading few city dwellers to pay any taxes at all. To provide another source of revenue, he advocated creating a state-issued franchise license, so that licensees would be the only business that could sell liquor in the state. The General Assembly approved and legalized beer and wine sales in the store in anticipation of the repeal of federal prohibition. The revenue increases had the desired effect and balanced the state budget and paid off the $3.4 million debt created during World War I. He left office with state possessing a $17 million surplus.\n\nMcNutt was very involved in joining the state to the new federal welfare programs. Legislation was passed to allow the state to participate in Social Security and worker's unemployment programs. Additionally, he was most active in pursuing federal jobs and created the administrative framework necessary for Indiana to participate in the Works Progress Administration programs. More than 75,000 Hoosiers were working in the government program before he left office. This created a massive patronage system that made McNutt one of the most powerful governors in the state's history.\n\nMcNutt earned the reputation of an old-style machine politician by using the reorganization of state government to oust his opponents, both Republican and Democratic, from state jobs and by forcing state employees to pay two percent of their salaries to the Indiana Democratic Party. The system for exclusive franchises for beer distribution were sold to his campaign contributors who in turn made large donations to him and the party. He also had the legislature postpone the 1933 municipal elections as a cost-saving measure, adding an extra year to the terms of local officials, a majority of whom were Democrats. McNutt took up the cause of getting John Dillinger paroled from the Michigan City State Penitentiary. He submitted a false record of Dillinger's criminal and prison activities and excluded two letters from law enforcers. Dillinger was granted clemency and later was named the first \"Public Enemy Number One.\" \n\nMcNutt also took up the cause of welfare reform. The new welfare laws passed effectively made charitable giving by the government an entirely state level controlled operation. Previously, local governments had been in charge of identifying needs and carrying out relief. McNutt began his term with the support of several key labor groups, but soon lost that support. Although McNutt's administration curtailed the use of court injunctions to prevent labor picketing, McNutt did not hesitate to declare martial law in eleven coal-mining counties where major violence accompanied union efforts to organize the miners. In all, McNutt called out the Indiana National Guard three times in response to labor-related violence.\n\nIn the 1934 mid-term elections, Republicans gained seats in both houses of the General Assembly and narrowed the Democratic majority. They began an attempt to rein in McNutt's power by creating a merit system to limit McNutt's control of the current patronage system. Publicly, McNutt supported the legislation, but once enacted it had very little effect on the operation of the government as many parts were simply ignored. Over time though, the system was gradually implemented in some state bureaus.\n\nIndiana's constitution kept McNutt from seeking reelection as governor in 1936, and he launched a bid to be nominated to run for President on the Democratic ticket. He was considered the front-runner until Roosevelt announced he would seek a second term. McNutt was overwhelmingly defeated, but attempted to be nominated for Vice President. Roosevelt, however, still recalled McNutt's lack of support in his previous reelection bid and refused to accept him. Despite the rejection, McNutt campaigned strongly for Roosevelt's reelection as president. Roosevelt made him High Commissioner to the Philippines in 1937, a post that McNutt thought would help him in a presidential bid in 1940 and which Roosevelt, contemplating a third term for himself, thought would effectively sideline McNutt.\n\nWith the Philippines largely self-governing, the post of high commissioner was mostly ceremonial. Nevertheless, McNutt managed to stir controversy by appearing fussy over details of protocol. He also questioned the wisdom of giving early independence to the islands as promised in the 1934 Tydings–McDuffie Act, believing that the small country could not defend itself. McNutt was also the target of criticism from Republicans, notably Representative Albert J. Engel of Michigan, for a proposal to construct a \"summer palace\" in the mountains near Baguio City.\n\nIn a notable humanitarian act, McNutt, in cooperation with Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon, quietly side-stepped the US Department of State in allowing the entry into the Philippines of 1300 Jewish refugees fleeing fascist regimes in Europe. This was at a time when the refugees could not legally enter the United States itself in large numbers.\n\nBy 1938 the press speculated that McNutt would, despite opposition from Roosevelt supporters, \"have to be reckoned with\" for the 1940 Democratic nomination for president because of his military and American Legion service, gubernatorial record, and \"astonishingly good looks.\" He left the Philippines in 1939 to become head of Roosevelt's new Federal Security Agency, an umbrella office that managed an array of New Deal programs that ranged from the Civilian Conservation Corps to Social Security. It also served as a cover agency from 1942 to 1944 for the War Research Service, a secret program to develop chemical and biological weapons. The FSA job gave McNutt high visibility, but his presidential hopes ended because Roosevelt decided to seek a third term. Although McNutt's name was floated as a possible vice-presidential running mate, Roosevelt apparently did not seriously consider the possibility, preferring the more liberal Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. Coincidentally, Roosevelt's opponent in 1940 was McNutt's Indiana University classmate and Beta Theta Pi fraternity brother Wendell Willkie, now a Republican.\n\nMcNutt loyally supported Roosevelt in 1940 and was given added responsibilities at the FSA in managing defense-related health and safety programs. In 1942, Roosevelt appointed him chairman of the War Manpower Commission, which was charged with planning to balance the labor needs of agriculture, industry and the armed forces, but the position carried little real power. While in this capacity, McNutt publicly urged \"the extermination of the Japanese \"in toto\"\". When asked for clarification, McNutt indicated that he was referring to the Japanese people as a whole—not just the Japanese military—\"for I know the Japanese people.\" In a further qualification one week after the original statement, McNutt stated that the comments reflected his personal views and not official U.S. government policy.\n\nMcNutt was among 12 nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Roosevelt's running mate in the presidential election that year, receiving one vote. After Japan's surrender in 1945, President Harry S. Truman sent him back to the Philippines for a second tour as high commissioner. Following Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, McNutt served as America's first ambassador to the islands, a post he left in 1947 to take up law practice in New York and Washington, D.C. After serving as ambassador, he also chaired the Philippine-American Trade Council, a business organization, and was a director of several firms in Manila. McNutt's prominence was demonstrated by his appearance on the covers of \"Life\" and \"Time\" magazines in 1939 when he returned from the Philippines, and on a \"Time\" cover in 1942 when he took the chair of the War Manpower Commission.\n\nIn 1950, McNutt became chairman of the board of United Artists Corporation. His involvement with the company was short-lived, as he and his management team stepped aside in favor of Arthur B. Krim and Robert Benjamin within less than a year.\n\nWhile in Texas, he met and married his wife, Kathleen. He was discharged as a major in 1919, and later joined the reserves, where he rose to the rank of colonel.\n\nMcNutt fell ill in 1955 and decided to travel on a cruise to the Philippines to recover in the warm climate after a surgery. His condition only worsened and after arriving in Manila he flew to New York for better care. He died March 24, 1955 in New York City, aged 63, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPaul V. McNutt Quadrangle, a residence hall complex at Indiana University Bloomington, is named for him and has a bust of him in the front foyer of the main building.\n\n\n"}

John made his Arsenal first-team debut on 28 October 1922 in a 2–1 defeat at home to Newcastle United, and quickly became a regular, succeeding Tom Whittaker at left half. His ability was such that soon after, made his debut for the Welsh national side, against Scotland on 17 March 1923; it was the first of fifteen caps.\n\nJohn was displaced from the Arsenal side in 1923–24 thanks to competition from Billy Blyth and Andrew Young, but after being switched to left back to cover for Andy Kennedy, he was a near ever-present in 1924–25. Eventually however, John was switched back to left half, and this time he remained a first-team regular. A prodigious ball-winner and noted passer of the ball, John reached (but lost) the FA Cup Final with Arsenal in 1926–27, after a mistake by his compatriot and close friend Dan Lewis; it was John who consoled Lewis after the final whistle, assuring him he would get another chance to a win a medal (although Lewis never did). He played in Arsenal's 2–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930.\n\nJohn remained in the Arsenal side through the first half of the 1930s, despite competition from the likes of Charlie Jones. He finally won some silverware with an FA Cup win in 1929–30, followed by three First Division titles, in 1930–31, 1932–33 and 1933–34. John also scored Arsenal's only goal of the 1932 FA Cup Final, in which Arsenal were controversially beaten by Newcastle United. By this time he was one of the senior members of the Arsenal squad, and mentored many of the club's younger new arrivals, such as Alex James.\n\nAlthough John played for Arsenal until his retirement in 1938, for the final three years of his career he was mainly a reserve player, having lost his place to Wilf Copping, and thus missed out on a medal in the Gunners' League win of 1934–35. Nevertheless, he played 470 times for the club in total, the most of any of Arsenal's pre-World War II players; as of 2006 he is tenth in the club's all-time appearances table.\n\nOn retiring in 1938, John joined the coaching staff at West Ham United. He later joined Torquay United as trainer, working under his former Highbury teammate Jack Butler, but when Butler left for Crystal Palace in May 1947, John followed, again as trainer. In 1949 he was appointed trainer-coach at Cardiff City, a position he held until March 1950 when he was appointed manager of Torquay United. He had an unsuccessful spell as manager at Plainmoor, winning only 7 of the 28 games he was in charge for and left his post in November 1950.\n\nHe finished his football career as a scout for Cardiff City. He died in Barry in 1982, at the age of 83. In 2008, his descendants loaned his shirts from the 1927, 1930 and 1932 FA Cup Finals to the Arsenal FC Museum.\n\nArsenal\n\n"}

{"id": "2047107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047107", "title": "Virtual representation", "text": "Virtual representation\n\nVirtual representation refers to the idea that the members of Parliament, including the Lords and the Crown-in-Parliament, reserved the right to speak for the interests of all British subjects, rather than for the interests of only the district that elected them or for the regions in which they held peerages and spiritual sway. Virtual representation was the British response to the First Continental Congress in the American colonies. The Second Continental Congress asked for representation in Parliament in the Suffolk Resolves, also known as the first Olive Branch Petition. Parliament claimed that their members had the well being of the colonists in mind. The Colonies rejected this premise.\n\nIn the early stages of the American Revolution, colonists in the Thirteen Colonies rejected legislation imposed upon them by the Parliament of Great Britain because the colonies were not represented in Parliament. According to the British constitution, colonists argued, taxes could be levied on British subjects only with their consent. Because the colonists were represented only in their provincial assemblies, they said, only those legislatures could levy taxes in the colonies. This concept was famously expressed as \"No taxation without representation\".\n\nIn \"The Constitutional Origins of the American Revolution\", Jack P. Greene writes that during \"the winter of 1764-5, in the months preceding the final passage of the Stamp Act,\" George Grenville and his lieutenant, Thomas Whately, attempted to explicitly articulate \"a theoretical justification for the exertion of parliamentary authority\" in the area of colonial taxation. Grenville and Whately's theory, known as \"virtual representation\", alleged that \"the colonists, like those individuals and groups who resided in Britain but had no voice in elections, were nonetheless \"virtually\" represented in Parliament.\" George Grenville defended all the taxes by arguing that the colonists were \"virtually represented\" in Parliament, a position that had critics on both sides of the British Empire. However, Parliament rejected the criticism that virtual representation was constitutionally invalid as a whole, and passed the Declaratory Act in 1766, asserting the right of Parliament to legislate for the colonies \"all cases whatsoever.\"\n\nThe idea of virtual representation \"found little support on either side of the Atlantic\" as a means of solving the constitutional controversy between colonists and Britons. William Pitt, a defender of colonial rights, ridiculed virtual representation, calling it \"the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of a man; it does not deserve serious refutation.\" Pitt said to the House of Commons in 1766, Pitt then stated to Parliament that, \"I myself would have cited the two cases of Chester and Durham...to show that, even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives...[A] higher example [might be found] in Wales—Wales that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated. Pitt pointed out that, unlike the \"India company, merchants, stockholders, [and] manufacturers\" who \"have it in their option to be actually represented...have connections with those that elect, and...have influence over them,\" the colonists had no such option, connections or influence.\n\nBenjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, \"I know that whenever the subject [of Parliamentary taxation] has occurred in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared to be the opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented...An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\" James Otis Jr. reasoned that the legal liberties of British subjects meant that Parliament should, or could, only tax the colonists if they were \"actually represented\" in Westminster.\n\nAt the time of the American Revolution, only England and Wales and Scotland were directly represented in the Parliament of Great Britain among the many parts of the British Empire. The colonial electorate perhaps consisted of 10% to 20% of the total population, or 75% of adult males. In Britain, by contrast, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population, or between 17% to 23% of males, could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry.\n\nAs virtual representation was founded on \"a defect in the Constitution of England,\" namely, the \"Want of a Full Representation of all the People of England,\" it was, therefore, a pernicious notion that had been fabricated for the sole purpose of arguing the colonists \"out of their civil Rights.\" The colonists, and some Britons, consequently condemned the idea of virtual representation as \"a sham\". Moreover, the poor state of representation in Britain \"was no excuse for taxing the colonists without their consent.\"\n\nDaniel Dulaney Jr. of Maryland, likewise observed that attempting to tax subjects on the inequitable basis of 'virtual' representation was unsound because, The situation of the non-electors in England—their capacity to become electors — their inseparable connection with those who are electors, and their representatives—their security against oppression resulting from this connection, and the necessity of imagining a double or virtual representation, to avoid iniquity and absurdity, have been explained—the inhabitants of the colonies are, as such, incapable of being electors, the privilege of election being exerciseable only in person, and therefore if every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold, not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to be an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great-Britain, a supposition which would be impertinent, because it shifts the question—should the colonies not be taxed by parliamentary impositions, their respective legislatures have a regular, adequate, and constitutional authority to tax them, and, therefore, there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons. There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed in a thousand shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.\n\nDulany Jr. also wrote that, \"the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament...[is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons.\" Dulany Jr. denied that Parliament had a right \"to impose an internal Tax upon the Colonies, without their consent for the single Purpose of Revenue.\"\n\nIn 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis Jr. said that, \n\nIn 1765 Otis Jr. attended the Continental Congress, otherwise known as the Stamp Act Congress, along with other colonial delegates. The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had \"a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists\" and that \"the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature.\" Furthermore, it was declared that, \"it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists.\"\n\nSebastian Galiani and Gustavo Torrens propose that virtual representation imposed a dilemma on the British elite, which had a direct influence on the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. They suggest the call for \"No taxation without representation\" and proposal of the inclusion of American representatives within Parliament, had they actually been implemented, would have encouraged coalition building between Americans and the British opposition (which was opposed to the dominant elite), disrupting the power of the incumbent landed gentry (who made up the elite). Through game theoretic models, Galiani and Torrens show that, once in Parliament, Americans could not feasibly commit to political alliances independent of the British opposition. As a result, mounting pressure for democratic reform would increase, posing a threat to the established British political order. Galiani and Torrens argue that British elites would incur greater losses to their domestic clout from American representation than from simply forfeiting a colony. The implications of forfeiting virtual representation forced the British elite, which dominated the government, to decide between maintaining the rule of the American colonies, which in their minds was infeasible, and engaging in war.\n\nCannon argues that for 18th and 19th century Britain:\n\n"}

She was named for Commodore Edward Preble.\n\n\"Preble\" was laid down by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, 12 April 1919; launched 8 March 1920; sponsored by Miss Sallie MacIntosh Tucker; and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard 19 March 1920, Cmdr. H. A. Baldridge in command.\n\nAfter shakedown in Cuban waters, \"Preble\" was assigned special duty in Mexican waters, arriving Vera Cruz 13 June. During the following weeks she made three voyages to Galveston, Texas, to obtain medical supplies including serum to fight bubonic plague which had developed during the rebellion of the Sonora triumvirate. In August she returned north to join the Atlantic Fleet in East Coast and Caribbean exercises. In January 1921 the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets joined off the Panama Canal Zone and cruised to the west coast of South America. Separating on 23 February, the Atlantic Fleet steamed back to the Caribbean.\n\n\"Preble\" departed Newport, Rhode Island, 20 June en route to the Asiatic Station, via Suez, with units of Squadron 15. She arrived at Chefoo, China, 26 August 1922, and for the next 7 years cruised off the coast of Asia from Manchuria to Burma, in Japanese waters, and amongst the Philippines, East Indies, and Marianas Islands. In September 1923 she assisted victims of violent earthquakes which shook Japan. From 12 June to 2 July 1924 she was at Rangoon, Burma, and Calcutta, India, delivering gas and oil for a round-the-world flight of Army planes. In 1927 \"Preble\" was assigned patrol duty in strife-torn China, taking aboard American and foreign refugees and escorting merchant vessels in the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers. On several occasions Chinese factions fired on \"Preble\" from shore, but there were no casualties.\n\n\"Preble\" departed Tsingtao, China, 12 July 1929 and returned to San Diego, California, 17 August 1929. For several years she was based at San Diego, cruising along the western seaboard of the United States, with operations in waters of Mexico and the Caribbean. During her stay at San Diego, \"Preble\" was used for on-board location shooting of a 1931 RKO-Pathé Pictures film about World War I destroyers, \"Suicide Fleet\", one of the three primary ships used for the filming of the movie. She was assigned to Rotating Reserve Destroyer Squadron 20 at the Mare Island Navy Yard 24 September 1932. In May 1934 \"Preble\" engaged in Fleet Problem 15 off the Panama Canal and in Cuban waters, before returning to the Pacific. She participated in Fleet Problems 16 and 18 in the Hawaiian area in May–June 1935 and April–May 1937.\n\nOn 19 May 1937 \"Preble\" was transferred from Destroyers, Battle Force, to duty with Minecraft, Battle Force. Converted to a light minelayer, she was reclassified DM-20, effective 30 June 1937. She departed Pearl Harbor 20 September 1937 for mine training operations on the West Coast and returned to Hawaii in December. She remained in the Hawaiian area until the outbreak of World War II, engaging in scheduled mining exercises and fleet maneuvers.\n\nOn 7 December 1941 when the Japanese forces launched their attack, \"Preble\" was being overhauled at Pearl Harbor and was unable to get underway. As necessary guns and ammunition were not aboard, a large number of \"Preble's\" crew handled ammunition, fought fires, and cared for the wounded aboard \"Pennsylvania\" (BB-38). On 30 January 1942 \"Preble\" completed her yard overhaul and joined the patrol operating just off the Pearl Harbor entrance. On 1 April she departed Pearl Harbor with units of Mine Division 1 to lay a large minefield at French Frigate Shoals, 500 miles northwest of Oahu. In July she assisted in laying a defensive minefield around the base at Kodiak, Alaska, returning to Pearl Harbor via Seattle, Washington, for overhaul and patrol operations. On 6 December she departed Pearl Harbor for the Fiji Islands and Noumea, New Caledonia, serving on escort duty in the New Hebrides during January 1943.\n\nOn the night of 31 January \"Tracy\" (DM-19), \"Montgomery\" (DM-17), and \"Preble\" laid mines in the mouth of the Tenambo River, Guadalcanal, to prevent the evacuation of enemy troops. During the next two months \"Preble\" performed escort duties to the New Hebrides and Russell Islands.\n\nOn the night of 6 May \"Preble\" with minelayers \"Gamble\" (DM-15) and \"Breese\" (DM-18) in company with \"Radford\" (DD-446) laid mines in Ferguson Passage between Gizo and Wanawana Islands in the Solomons. On the night of 7–8 May these mines sank a Japanese destroyer and damaged two others which were sunk the next day by torpedo bombers from Guadalcanal.\n\nOn 24 May \"Preble\" rescued 85 survivors from torpedoed SS \"Stanvac Manila\". On the night of 28 June \"Breese\", \"Gamble\", and \"Preble\" mined the waters near Shortland Island to prevent units of the Japanese fleet based there from interfering with landing operations on Rendova Island in the New Georgia Group, which were to be carried out at dawn. During July and August \"Preble\" again served as an escort vessel. On 9 September she departed Nouméa for San Francisco.\n\nAfter overhaul and convoy escort duty to Pearl Harbor, \"Preble\" reached Majuro, Marshall Islands, 3 February 1944 where she served as antisubmarine screen and mine layer before returning to Pearl Harbor. She then made three escort voyages from Pearl Harbor to Marshall Islands ports. After minesweeping training, \"Preble\" departed Purvis Bay, Florida Island, 6 September, with minesweeping units of Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's TG 32.5. Arriving off Peleliu in the early morning of 12 September, while fire support ships opened bombardment, \"Preble\" separated to investigate the shoals between Anguar and Peleliu Islands where the enemy had been suspected of planting acoustic mines. The next day she helped rescue survivors of \"Perry\" (DMS-17) which had struck a mine. She continued to perform various screening and minesweeping duties.\n\n\"Preble\" arrived at Manus, Admiralty Islands on 1 October, where she joined mine sweeping Task Group 77.5 which arrived off the entrance to Leyte Gulf 17 October where she remained laying buoys and acting as mine destruction vessel for 6 days before returning to Manus. After training at Manus, she returned to San Pedro Bay 1 January 1945, but steamed a month later for Pearl Harbor and much needed repairs in the States, arriving San Francisco 8 March.\n\nReturning to Pearl Harbor 8 May, \"Preble\" was redesignated a miscellaneous auxiliary vessel (AG-99) 5 June. She was assigned to duty escorting aircraft carriers engaged in training, acting as anti-submarine patrol vessel and plane guard during flight operations. She reached Guam with \"Vella Gulf\" (CVE-111) 20 July, subsequently escorting \"Vella Gulf\" to Okinawa. After returning to Guam, she escorted \"Sitkoh Bay\" (CVE-86) to Samar, Philippines, arriving 20 September.\n\n\"Preble\" steamed for the United States 9 October, arriving Norfolk 20 November. She decommissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard 7 December 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy List 3 January 1946 and she was sold for scrap to Luria Brothers of Philadelphia 26 October 1946.\n\n\"Preble\" earned 8 battle stars for World War II service.\n\nIn the episode \"Long Live the King\" from the first season (1964–1965) of the television show \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\", the long-since-scrapped USS \"Preble\" (DD-345) is plainly visible in stock footage used in the final quarter of the episode, and the Captain Lee Crane character played by David Hedison indicates that the footage is showing the advanced units of the United States Seventh Fleet during the 1970s, the time period in which the first season is set.\nIn the 1931 film \"Suicide Fleet\" the Preble is seen as one of several ships assisting in rescuing survivors of sinking ship. The scene is in the first of hour of the movie. The film stars William Boyd, Robert Armstrong, James Gleason, and Ginger Rogers. Later shipboard scenes are also shot aboard the Preble; giving a good look at the ship as she looked in 1931. There is one particularly interesting scene where a close in shot of the Preble making a close-in pass (with-in 50 ft.) of a sailing ship.\n\nEven though not named but clearly marked 345, the USS Preble appeared in the 1942 movie, \"The Navy Came Through\" starring Desi Arnez and Jackie Cooper. The Clemson class destroyer is easily identified by its tell-tale four smoke stacks, also known as a 'Four Stacker'.\n\nSee USS \"Preble\" for other ships of this name.\n\nThe U.S.S.

He was a central figure of the Greek literary generation of the 1880s and one of the cofounders of the so-called New Athenian School (or Palamian School, or Second Athenian School) along with Georgios Drosinis, Nikos Kampas, and Ioannis Polemis.\n\nBorn in Patras, he received his primary and secondary education in Mesolonghi. In 1877 he enrolled at the School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences of the University of Athens, but he soon abandoned his studies. In 1880s, he worked as a journalist. He published his first collection of verses, the \"\"Songs of My Fatherland\"\", in 1886. He held an administrative post at the University of Athens between 1897 and 1926, and died during the German occupation of Greece during World War II. His funeral was a major event of the Greek resistance: the funerary poem composed and recited by fellow poet Angelos Sikelianos roused the mourners and culminated in an angry demonstration of a 100,000 people against Nazi occupation.\n\nPalamas wrote the lyrics to the Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras. It was first performed at the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first modern Olympic Games. The Hymn was then shelved as each host city from then until the 1960 Winter Olympics commissioned an original piece for its celebration of the Games, but the version by Samaras and Palamas was declared the official Olympic Anthem in 1958 and has been performed at each celebration of the Games since the 1960 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe old administration building of the University of Athens, in central Athens, where his office was located, is now dedicated to him as the \"Kosti Palamas Building\" and houses the \"Greek Theater Museum\", as well as many temporary exhibitions.\n\nHe has been informally called the \"national\" poet of Greece and was closely associated with the struggle to rid Modern Greece of the \"purist\" language and with political liberalism. He dominated literary life for 30 or more years and greatly influenced the entire political-intellectual climate of his time. Romain Rolland considered him the greatest poet of Europe and he was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature on a total of 14 occasions, but never received it. His most important poem, \"\"The Twelve Lays of the Gypsy\"\" (1907), is a poetical and philosophical journey. His \"Gypsy\" is a free-thinking, intellectual rebel, a Greek Gypsy in a post-classical, post-Byzantine Greek world, an explorer of work, love, art, country, history, religion and science, keenly aware of his roots and of the contradictions between his classical and Christian heritages.\n\n\n\n\nPalamas was one of the most respected literary critics of his day, and instrumental in the reappraisal of the works of Andreas Kalvos, Dionysios Solomos and the \"Ionian School\" of poetry, Kostas Krystallis et al.\n\n\n"}

The band had a distinctive guitar-jangle sound with male and female vocals. The band took their name from Elvis Presley's stillborn twin brother, Jesse Garon Presley.\n\nThe original members of the band were Andrew Tully (guitars/vocals), Eric Webster and Angus McPake (bass guitar), Fran Schoppler (vocals), Margarita Vasquez-Ponte (drums), Kevin McMahon (guitars), and Stuart Clarke (guitar). Tully, Webster and Vasquez-Ponte were also members of Rote Kapelle, a band that was active from 1985–1988. \n\nThis initial line-up recorded the first two singles, \"Splashing Along\" and \"The Rain Fell Down\" (described by one reviewer as a \"pop gem that's not to be missed\") on Narodnik Records. With the departure of McMahon and Clarke, Bruce Hopkins and John Robb (not the Manchester writer) were drafted in for third single, the \"Billy the Whizz\" EP; these being replaced on a more permanent basis by Michael Kerr (of Meat Whiplash). Next release was a flexi-disc featuring the track \"Hank Williams Is Dead\" along with a track by The Fizzbombs, a side-project of Margarita and Angus, along with Ann Donald of The Shop Assistants. Moving to Velocity Records, the band released two more well-received singles, \"The Adam Faith Experience\" and \"You'll Never Be That Young Again\", followed by first album, \"A Cabinet of Curiosities\", which collected the tracks released to date.\n\nIn 1989, Robb left to join The Darling Buds, and the band returned in 1990 with single \"Grand Hotel\", a reference to the IRA bombing of Brighton's Grand Hotel, the venue for the Conservative Party conference.

He was a well-known preacher. In 1899 he announced his support for socialism and joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany; for this, he lost his position as minister. The next year, he was elected to the state parliament of Württemberg.\n\nAs the First World War broke out, he declared his belief in a coming Kingdom of God, declaring \"we live in the time before a massive change in the world. This darkness will be vanquished through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" He was a significant influence on the theologians Karl Barth, Hermann Kutter, and Leonhard Ragaz, who were also Christian socialists.\n\nThe son of Johann Christoph Blumhardt, Christoph Blumhardt was born at Möttlingen on 1 June 1842, at the very time his father was becoming involved in the struggle with Gottliebin's demons. As his father had done before him, he took university training pointing toward a Reformed pastorate. However, he became disillusioned with the church and theology and so decided simply to return home to Bad Boll and act as a helper there. Upon his father's death, then, he took over as housefather and continued the work until his own death in 1919.\n\nIn time, the younger Blumhardt became quite renowned as a mass evangelist and faith healer. But after a very successful \"crusade\" in Berlin in 1888, he drastically cut back both activities, saying,\nBlumhardt's interest gradually took what could be called \"a turn to the world\", namely, a focus upon the great socioeconomic issues of the day. Under the impetus of this concern Blumhardt chose, in a public and conspicuous way, to cast his lot with democratic socialism, the much-maligned workers' movement that then was fighting tooth and nail for the right of the working class. Although it brought upon his head the wrath of both the civil and ecclesiastical establishments, he addressed protest rallies, ran for office on the party slate, and was elected to a six-year term in the Württemberg legislature. He was asked to resign his ministerial status in the church. Blumhardt began as a very active and energetic legislator, but as time passed he greatly curtailed this activity and bluntly declined to stand for a second term of office. Clearly, the pattern was of a piece with his earlier retreat from mass evangelism and faith healing.\n\nBlumhardt's disillusionment with democratic socialism – i.e., with the party politics, not with the movement's purposes and ideals – and the even greater disillusionment which came toward the close of his life with the dark years of the First World War. These brought him to a final position expressed in the dialectical motto: Wait and Hasten. Staunchly anti-war, his understanding was that the call of the Christian is still for him to give himself completely to the cause of the kingdom. To do everything in his power to help the world toward that goal. Yet, at the same time, a Christian must remain calm and patient, unperturbed even if his efforts show no signs of success, willing to wait for the Lord to bring the kingdom at his own pace and in his own way. And, according to Blumhardt, far from being inactivity, this sort of waiting is itself a very strong and creative action in the very hastening of the kingdom. Blumhardt suffered a stroke in 1917 and died a peaceful death on 2 August 1919 in Jebenhausen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2047162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047162", "title": "Battle of the Crimissus", "text": "Battle of the Crimissus\n\nThe Battle of the Crimissus (also spelled \"Crimisus\" and \"Crimesus\") was fought in 339 BC between a large Carthaginian army commanded by Asdrubal and Hamilcar and an army from Syracuse led by Timoleon. Timoleon attacked the Carthaginian army by surprise near the Crimissus river in western Sicily (originally it was thought that it was the modern Belice river in southwest Sicily, but it has been recently identified with the modern Freddo river in northwest Sicily ) and won a great victory. When he defeated another much smaller force of Carthaginians shortly afterwards, Carthage sued for peace. The peace allowed the Greek cities on Sicily to recover and began a period of stability. However, another war between Syracuse and Carthage erupted after Timoleon's death, not long after Agathocles seized power in 317 BC.\n\nCarthage had tried to prevent Timoleon's arrival on Sicily, where he had been invited by the citizens of Syracuse to depose the Greek tyrants and restore democracy and order. After liberating Syracuse itself, Timoleon sent his mercenaries to raid the Carthaginian territory on western Sicily. Carthage had already gathered a large army, which was moving towards Syracuse in response to the raids.\n\nVastly outnumbered, Timoleon attacked the Carthaginian army while it was crossing the Crimissus river. The Carthaginians fiercely resisted the initial assault, but a storm which started during the battle worked to the advantage of the Greeks. When the first rank of the Carthaginian army was defeated, the whole army was routed. The Greeks killed or captured many of those who fled and Carthage lost a large number of its wealthiest citizens in the battle.\n\nBecause the citizens of Syracuse suffered from political upheaval and civil war under the regime of Dionysius II, they appealed to Corinth (which had founded Syracuse) to send them a general to depose the tyrants and administer their city. The Corinthian senate chose to send Timoleon.\n\nIn 359/8 BC Dionysius II had made peace with Carthage. Carthage probably profited from the political instability on Sicily because it weakened the military power of the Greeks. As a consequence they tried to prevent Timoleon from setting foot on Sicily in 345/4 BC, but were unsuccessful. A confusing siege of Syracuse ensued in 344/3 BC with Timoleon, Dionysius, Hicetas and his Carthaginian allies each controlling different parts of the city. The two primary sources which describe the siege, Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch, give very different accounts. According to Plutarch Dionysius surrendered the acropolis to Timoleon right away and was expelled to Corinth. Diodoros states that this happened at the end of the siege in 343/2 BC. The Carthaginians broke off the siege and retreated. Timoleon then attacked the forces of Hicetas and drove them out of Syracuse.\n\nTimoleon then proceeded to liberate the other Greek cities on Sicily in 342/1 BC in order to restore them their autonomy and democracy. He sent his mercenaries to raid the Carthaginian territory in western Sicily, which gained him a large amount of booty. As his military strength and reputation grew, all the other Sicilian Greek cities submitted to him voluntarily because of his policy of restoring autonomy to them. He was approached by many other cities under the control of Carthage, including those of the Sicels and the Sicanians, who wished to become his allies.\n\nThe Carthaginians were alarmed by Timoleon's success and shipped a large army to Lilybaeum. According to Plutarch it numbered seventy thousand men and included siege engines and chariots with four horses each. Their army was large enough to conquer Sicily in its entirety, even with the Greeks united under Timoleon. When they received news that their territory was being raided by Timoleon's mercenaries, they marched against them immediately under the command of Hasdrubal and Hamilcar. When the Syracusans heard about the coming of the huge Carthaginian army, they were terrified; Timoleon could gather no more than 3,000 of them to march against the Carthaginians. While on the march, 1,000 of Timoleon's 4,000 mercenaries deserted him and returned to Syracuse. His army now numbered 5,000 foot and 1,000 horse. He led them on march of eight days away from Syracuse towards the river Crimissus, where the Carthaginians were concentrating. Diodorus Siculus reports a greater size of Timoleon's army, giving a number of 12,000 men.\n\nThe battle was fought in early June 339 BC. Timoleon was positioned on a hill with his army, overlooking a plain where the Carthaginian army was located. The Crimissus river separated the two armies and covered the plain in a thick fog, making it impossible to see the Carthaginian camp. However, the noise signaled to the Greeks that the Carthaginians were going to cross the river. The sun had risen higher in the sky and dissipated the fog in the plain, making the Carthaginian troops visible. The four-horse chariots were at the vanguard of the army. Behind them was infantry which the Greeks identified as Carthaginian citizens and at the rear were the foreign troops. Timoleon noticed the army was separated by the river, giving him a good opportunity to attack. He decided to send the cavalry ahead to prevent the Carthaginian citizen infantry from forming their phalanx.\n\nTimoleon then commanded his army to descend into the plain. He assigned the other Sicilian Greeks and a few of his mercenaries to his wings. He commanded the center, which was composed of the Syracusans and his best mercenaries. He saw that his cavalry could not attack the enemy infantry because of the chariots. He ordered his cavalry to ride past the line of chariots to attack the infantry on the flank. He then charged the enemy with the infantry. The Carthaginian citizen infantry resisted the Greeks sturdily however, thanks to their excellent armor and large shields. Fortunately for the Greeks a thunderstorm rose up behind them and started a shower of hail and rain. The storm hit the Greeks in the back, but the Carthaginians in the face. The storm put them at a severe disadvantage: the water and mud made them ineffective fighters because of their heavy armor. To make things worse for the Carthaginians, the storm caused the Crimissus to overflow from its banks and many smaller streams to flow over the plain.\n\nThe Carthaginian army fled when the Greeks defeated the first rank of four hundred men. Many of those who fled over the plain were overtaken by the Greeks and killed. Some drowned in the river when they met the part of the Carthaginian army which still tried to cross the river. Out of the 10,000 casualties for the Carthaginian army, 3,000 were Carthaginian citizens. Carthage had never lost so many of its own citizens before because it was used to employing Libyans, Numidians and Iberians for its armies. At least 5,000 prisoners were accounted for, and many more were hidden or stolen by the Greek soldiers. As they stripped the dead bodies of their possessions, the Greeks acquired a great deal of gold and silver from the rich Carthaginian citizens. After the Greek army captured the Carthaginian camp so much effort was required to gather the spoils that it took until the third day to erect a trophy on the site.\n\nDiodorus Siculus calls the Carthaginian citizen infantry as the Sacred Band of Carthage. He puts their number at 2,500 and states that they all fought to the death. Of the other nationalities of the army, more than 10,000 perished and 15,000 were taken captive.\n\nTimoleon left his mercenaries to plunder the Carthaginian territory and returned to Syracuse. Hicetas and Mamercus, the tyrants who still controlled respectively Leontini and Catana, made an alliance with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians sent a fleet of seventy ships and Greek mercenaries under Gisco to their aid. This force landed in the territory of Messana, where they defeated four hundred of Timoleon's mercenaries. Another group of his mercenaries was ambushed and eliminated by the Carthaginians near Ietae, in Carthaginian territory.\n\nNevertheless, Plutarch relates that Timoleon managed to defeat Hicetas in the Battle of the Damurias River. Mamercus was defeated by Timoleon in the Battle of the Abolus River, in which the Carthaginian soldiers he received from Gisco made up a large part of the casualties. After this defeat Carthage decided to make peace with Timoleon, to which he agreed. The terms were that Carthage was to keep its territory within the Lycus river, to restore the family and property to anyone who wished to move to Syracuse and that it would end their alliance with the tyrants. Mamercus fled to Messana where he took refuge with the tyrant of that city, Hippo. When Timoleon besieged Messana by land and sea, Hippo tried to escape aboard a ship, but was caught and executed by the city's inhabitants. Mamercus then surrendered to Timoleon. In the account of Diodorus Siculus Hicetas is mentioned as well, but Mamercus and Hippo are not. Diodorus does mention other tyrants which Timoleon deposed: the Campanians in Aetna, Nicodemus in Centuripae and Apolloniades in Agyrium.\n\nTimoleon succeeded in ending the warfare on Sicily between the Greek tyrants and with Carthage, but peace and stability did not last for long after his death. A new tyrant, Agathocles, seized power in Syracuse in 317 BC and started another war with Carthage.\n"}

Additionally, FASNY provides legislative representation that monitors and takes action on topics of importance to the services.\n\nThe current president is [http://www.fasny.com/index.php/about/72-2///Kenneth Pienkowski, the First Vice President is Steve Klien, and the Second Vice President is John Farrell Jr..\n\nEach year, FASNY provides training and education programs around the state on a variety of topics. Experts present training to thousands of emergency service providers across the State of New York.\n\nThe purpose of the Training and Education Committee is threefold. First, the committee promotes FASNY as the voice of the volunteer fire service in New York State. The second purpose is to increase the membership of FASNY. The final and most important purpose is to reduce the number of injuries and deaths of fire and EMS responders by providing training in safety and other fire and EMS related topics. This training takes place via workshops and programs covering a wide range of fields: administration, Chaplain's, Fire Police, Haz-Mat and emergency response.\n\nThe FASNY Legislative Committee confronts issues on behalf of its membership on a regular basis, striving to resolve them and provide solutions to future questions and concerns through advocacy.\n\nEach year, FASNY recognizes achievements in firefighting, EMS, teaching, fire safety education and community service. FASNY also helps recognize those volunteer firefighters who have achieved 50 years of service in New York State.\n\n\n\nThe FASNY Firemen’s Home is a facility designed with the members’ comfort in mind. Specialized rehabilitation for both younger and older members includes health care, the camaraderie of socializing with fellow firefighters, and continued connections to firefighting activities.\n\nLicensed by the New York State Department of Health.\n\nThe FASNY Federal Credit Union is chartered to serve the financial needs of members, immediate family members and employees of the Firemen's Association of the State of New York (FASNY) and the Firemen's Home, volunteer organizations such as fire departments, districts, fire companies, EMS and ambulance squads. Also included are members of LAFASNY, as well as employees, State, Department, and Personal members of the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC).\n\nThe FASNY Museum of Firefighting is home to years of firefighting history in New York State. At the 51st State Firemen's Convention held in Hudson in 1923, a resolution signed by the Presidents and Secretaries of both the Volunteer Firemen's Association and the Exempt Firemen's Association of the City of New York said that if the State Association of the Firemen's Home would authorize the erection of a suitable building for a museum, four fire engines, one built in England in 1725, a Gooseneck more than one hundred years old, a piano-style engine 63 years old and a double-deck engine, would all be donated as the first pieces.\n\nSo, amid much anticipation, the Museum was built with a center hall long with two adjoining wings long, amounting to of museum space. At 3 am on the morning of November 12, 1925, six large trucks brought the valuable collection up from New York City. The items were numbered and cataloged and then placed on display. The Museum was dedicated on Memorial Day 1926 with appropriate ceremonies.\n\nIn order to accommodate the numerous donations to the Museum, additions were necessary. The first addition was added in 1957, 31 years after the initial opening. The second addition came in 1972, with another expansion in 1989, and yet another in 2000 adding to the current size, totaling more than .\n\nIn August 1872 as the parade moved along the main street of Auburn, N.Y., a state convention of a benevolent organization had just concluded one of its annual meetings and the members were passing review of the town folk. A group of local volunteer firemen stood on the curb watching, when one of them, whose name history does not record, spoke up, asking: “Why not have a firemen’s convention?” Little did any of those boys realize at the time that this chance remark would provide the incentive for the formation of what was to become one of the largest organizations in the state.\n\nWord was passed around in the various fire companies that they were to meet soon to consider organizing the details for a permanent Firemen's Association. On September 2 the members of the Auburn fire department met at the courthouse. After “much free and uninterrupted discussion” it was agreed that each of the six fire companies at their next monthly meetings would select three members to act as a committee. This steering committee was to meet with the officers of the department on September 6 to present the report relative to forming a national firemen's association.\n\nThree members each from Logan Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, Neptune Hose Co. No. 1, Auburn Hose Co. No. 2, Niagara Hose Co. No. 3, Cayuga Hose Co. No. 4 and Union Hose Co. No. 5 were selected at the regular monthly meetings of the companies on September 4. This committee met the next evening and prepared a report, which was presented at the September 6th meeting of the entire fire department.\n\nThe report was in the form of a resolution stating that the object of the association be “co-operative in nature and with the view to improve the general government of the fire departments, the discussion and adoption of modern and improved fire apparatus, as well as a general interchange of ideas and a discussion of important questions pertaining to the various duties of firemen.”\n\nThe resolution also called for the appointment of an executive committee of three, with full power, and subordinate committees on finance, entertainment, and reception. It stated that at the convention there shall preside a president, six vice-presidents, one corresponding secretary and one recording secretary, also that each company in all fire departments be entitled to one representative in the convention, his expenses to be defrayed by his respective company.\n\nThe report was again read and adopted by clauses. On motion, the following persons were appointed to the respective committees named in the resolution:\n\nFinance Committee George Milk-Logan and Ladder Co. Joseph H. Norris-Neptune Hose Co. George Friend-Auburn Hose Co. N.D. Kierst-Niagara Hose Co. Wright Milk-Cayuga Hose Co. Charles Tallowday-Union Hose Co.\n\nReception Committee George Smith-Logan Hook and Ladder Co. A. Sanford-Niagara Hose Co. Wright Milk-Cayuga Hose Co. Lewis Montgomery-Union Hose Co.\n\nEntertainment William McEwan-Logan Hook and Ladder Co. Joseph Furness-Neptune Hose Co. H.P. Brown-Cayuga Hose Co.\n\nA meeting of the executive committee was held on September 11. At this meeting it was decided that the first annual Convention of the Firemen's National Association be held in the City of Auburn on Tuesday and Wednesday, October 1 and 2, 1872. It was also decided that each fire company in every fire department in the United States be invited to send one delegate, and that the Chief Engineer of every department be requested to procure a list of the names of the delegates selected in his locality and forward the same to the secretary.\n\nAs the day for the opening of the Convention drew near, interest and enthusiasm in the project grew by leaps and bounds. Eleven states sent letters indicating that they would send delegates, though when the Convention opened, only Paterson, NJ and Des Moines, IA were represented. The business community was generous in supplying funds to be used “toward carrying out the purposes of the Committee of Arrangements and the Reception Committee for the hospitable entertainment of all delegates, who will be cared for with a welcome to ensure their best comfort.”\n\nPlans for the first day called for the business of organizing a Firemen's National Convention and “addresses from good speakers.”\n\nIn the evening, a Grand Inauguration Ball would be held at the Academy of Music. The second day would be devoted to a parade and amusements. Visiting steam fire engines, hose and other companies would compete in tests, and a trial of the city water works would be given. As a special feature, arrangements were made for a half-mile race between Hose Co. No. 7 of Ithaca and Niagara Hose Co. No. 3 of Auburn.\n\nInvitations were sent to Syracuse, Ithaca and Oswego inviting fire engine companies to be present with their apparatus. For music, the 49th Regiment Band was engaged. The committee let it be known that contributions were being solicited for dinners of the visiting firemen and that baskets of refreshments of any kind should be left at the Academy of Music by 10:00 a.m. on the second day of the Convention.\n\nThe morning session began an hour later than the scheduled time period. Only two pieces of business were enacted—the report of the Business Committee and the appointment of the first Executive Committee.\n\nMr. Smith of Oswego, chairman of the Business Committee presented his report in the form of a Resolution, the main points being \"That the firemen of Auburn did a wise and beneficent act in organizing the Convention\" and that it was found upon assembling that only a portion of this and other states were represented, \"Therefore, Be It Resolved: That this body be known as the Firemen's Association of the State of New York.\"\n\n\n\nFASNY is also the acronym for the French-American School of New York, a bilingual school located in Westchester County\n"}

In 1885 the German colony of German New Guinea created a town on the site and named it after the discoverer (\"-hafen = -harbor\"). Evangelical Lutheran missionaries, organized by Johann Flierl, settled near the town, establishing a Mission station at Simbang, and later at Sattelberg, approximately away. Malaria was the bane of the town from the start. An epidemic in 1891 caused the colonists to briefly leave and only to return and then leave again ten years later in 1901. Other New Guinea towns were favoured instead, especially Rabaul.\n\nDuring the Second World War Finschhafen was fought over by Japan and Australia, along with the United States. The Japanese first occupied the town on 10 March 1942. Australian forces, as part of US Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's task force, landed nearby and seized the town in October 1943.

The 173-foot (53 m) tall ride was built in 1989 as the fastest looping roller coaster in the world, reaching speeds up to 68 mph (109 km/h). It was designed by Ron Toomer and built by Arrow Dynamics, which built its sister coasters Shockwave (dismantled in 2002) at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois and Viper at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. All three coasters have three loops after the lift hill, a batwing, and a double corkscrew. Scream Machine succeeded its sister coaster Shockwave as the tallest and fastest looping coaster in the world, but relinquished the claim to its other sister coaster Viper. Both Shockwave and Scream Machine only held the claim for one year. Although a roller coaster of the same name exists at Six Flags Over Georgia, that ride is an out and back wooden roller coaster.\n\nThe coaster track was painted red and the supports were white. The trains were named Freedom (red), Liberty (white) and Spirit (blue). The ground underneath the ride featured a red and white design resembling the stripes on a waving American flag. The maximum capacity of the ride was 1,680 guests per hour.\n\nThe over-the-shoulder restraint handles were made of foam instead of metal. The Scream Machine's on-ride camera was located at the curve before entering the double corkscrew, unlike those of its sister coasters; the cameras on both rides were located at the bottom of the Boomerang.\n\nOver the years, the Great American Scream Machine became known as a rough ride, causing pain to riders mostly seated in the rear of the train and often riders just meeting the minimum height limit of the ride or taller than the average rider.\n\n\nAfter its first season, the top of the vertical loops were removed and replaced by track with additional strength bracing. This was due to issues with other Arrow coasters, including Shockwave at Six Flags Great America. The top of the original first loop can be found in the monkeys' enclosure in the Wild Safari at Six Flags Great Adventure. Along with the new loop tops, a trim brake was installed after the first loop. The trim brake is not set up to stop a train; it is used to slightly adjust the speed of the train when temperatures reach around 90 degrees.\n\nIn 2005, The Great American Scream Machine and were repainted.\n\nIn 2009, the Liberty (white) train was ad-wrapped as an advertisement for one of the ride's sponsors, got2b Glued Styling Spiking Glue, a hair gel. Assorted signs were also placed on the station platform advertising. It was the first train in the park to feature advertisements, but as this idea spread throughout the Six Flags chain, it was joined by Kingda Ka and El Toro, whose trains feature The Karate Kid and Stride Gum ads, respectively.\n\nIn the 2010 operating season, guests noticed that the Liberty (white) train was adwrapped as an advertisement for another ride sponsor, Axe, a grooming product for young males. Signs for the product could be found around the rides entrance.\n\nAfter departing the station, the train crossed a transfer track and traveled down a small dip, then completed a 180-degree turn to the left onto the lift hill. After a climb, the train dropped to the left, reaching a top speed of . The train then traveled through its first inversion, a single vertical loop. After exiting the loop, the train turned to the left and traveled through a double-loop. The train then traveled upward with a left turn onto the mid-course brake run. The train came to a complete stop for 2 seconds. The train then dropped down into a boomerang element. After the boomerang, the train made a right turn, where riders' pictures are taken. The train then proceeded to enter the double corkscrew, then completed a 180-degree turn to the left onto the final brake run back into the station.\n\nDuring the 2010 season, speculation that Great American Scream Machine was being removed at the end of the season began circulating on message boards, pegging June 30, 2010, as a possible last day of operation. None of the rumors initially were confirmed nor denied until July 1, 2010, when a staff member stated that the coaster was not being removed. In a contradicting statement released on July 5, 2010, Six Flags Great Adventure informally announced the coaster's permanent closure would occur on July 18, 2010, in order to clear space for a new attraction in 2011. The announcement was officially confirmed on the park's website a few days later.\n\nAs announced, the ride's last operating day was on July 18, 2010. Deconstruction began soon after, and signs teasing the construction of its replacement were posted. A first look at the outline of the new ride replacing the Scream Machine was revealed on August 6, 2010. Six Flags requested permission from Jackson Township to remove parking spaces from the area behind to accommodate the ride's construction. On September 15, 2010, Six Flags unveiled the new ride as Green Lantern, a stand-up roller coaster relocated from Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, where it originally operated as Chang. It would be re-themed to the DC Comics Green Lantern superhero.\n\nFollowing the demolition, only Viper at Six Flags Magic Mountain remained from the original three Arrow installations involving their custom, 7-inversion design. The other one, Shockwave at Six Flags Great America, was demolished in 2002.\n\n\n"}

The game also has the largest character roster — 24 characters playable in Tales of Souls mode and an additional 18 playable in all other modes — and largest battle stage selection in \"Soul\" series history.\n\nThe Character Creation Mode allows the player to choose from several classes, clothing and armor, and physical features. Most of the classes can use up to five disciplines, three of which are unique, and two of which are \"Soul of ...\" disciplines: an exact replica of a main story character's moves. The created fighter's personality can be altered, which influences their quotes and their actions during battle. However, the personality is chosen by the equipment the character wears, and not directly by the player.\n\nThe Soul Arena is a mode that allows both the eight-match Quick Play (the standard Arcade Mode of the game), which is light on story and allows a speedy confrontation with Abyss, as well as the pre-defined Missions which include variations on the standard matches. There is a World Competition mode created to simulate tournament rounds (of either eliminations or Round Robin) against the CPU.\n\nThe Tales of Souls mode is presented as a book, narrating the selected character's story in detail during various chapters. The player can input button combos when an icon appears in the top right-hand corner during cut scene movies. The cut scenes can have different outcomes depending on whether the player successfully inputs the sequence. During movies that precede a battle after the cut scene ends, not inputting the code could result in the player starting the subsequent battle with a disadvantageous effect.\n\nAlthough the \"Mortal Kombat\", \"Street Fighter\" and \"Dead or Alive\" series all supported online play, \"Soulcalibur III\" does not. The game's producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama said \"At the current time, the online infrastructure is extremely different between countries, and there are people that can not enjoy network gaming. We've decided to concentrate on improving the game's offline content and its characters so that people all over the world will be able to have fun.\"\n\nChronicles of the Sword is a one-player game that is turn-based. The objective of this Dungeons & Dragons style RPG is to make a character using the custom character creation system and play it through a story. It begins with the player starting out as a rookie commander for the Grandall Empire. There are 20 chronicles, or levels, each one getting harder than the last. The basis is the player's troops are minimized and they move like board game pieces. The player must fight the enemies and take their strongholds scattered through the level. When two enemies on the map are fighting, the player could have them slash each other on their own or duel it out \"Soulcalibur\" style. Winning the chronicles results in a certain amount of gold, depending on how well the player did. As the characters fight, they gain levels, and become stronger. Sometimes the standard characters may be found in strongholds or standing and they are always level 60 (Olcadan and Abyss, however, do not appear). As the story progresses the player also gain some pre-made characters that can be controlled.\n\nThe plot places the player's character in the role of a young cadet of the Grandall Empire, who is chosen to lead the war against its neighboring countries, Halteese and Dalkia. As the player proceeds in their campaign, taking territories and forcing enemy troops back, they start to realize the true meaning of war and the reason they fight, eventually discovering the true enemies of their country. Throughout the chronicles, the player gains many rewards. Most characters' ultimate weapons (the weapons with four effects) are obtained throughout the story. The player can also unlock more armor, faces, disciplines, etc. for custom characters. If the player starts Chronicles of the Sword after certain weapon disciplines have been unlocked, the character may use those during battle.\n\nThe main three new warriors in the game are Tira, Zasalamel and Setsuka, all with totally different fighting styles than other series fighters. Nearly all of the warriors previously featured in \"Soul\" series titles return, with the exception of Inferno, Necrid, Seong Han-myeong, Edge Master and the console-exclusive \"Soulcalibur II\" special guests (Heihachi, Link, and Spawn). \"Soulcalibur II\"s mimic character Charade does return in a non-playable form, as do the generic Lizardmen.\n\nUnlockable characters include personnel in the Chronicles of the Sword, opponents from the Tales of Souls mode, and the weapon, armor, and item shop owners. In the Character Creation mode, players can re-create KOS-MOS from the \"Xenosaga\" series as well as Taira No Kagekiyo from Genpei Tōma Den and Gilgamesh from The Tower of Druaga.\n\nThis game takes place shortly after the events of \"Soulcalibur II\", in 1590. The amount of time is not specified, but taking into account the various characters' profiles, a minimum of four months has already passed (one month Xianghua needed to carry Kilik back to his master's hermit, three months that took Kilik to surpass his master's training).\n\nThe wicked Soul Edge survived its fated encounter with the wielder of Soulcalibur, Xianghua, and restored its control over the body of Siegfried Schtauffen, turning him back into the Azure Knight Nightmare. Four years later, Nightmare was about to restore Soul Edge, when suddenly a man named Raphael appeared, intending on taking Soul Edge. Nightmare defeated the attacker, but was distracted by Siegfried's latent will trying to restore his body. Using the distraction, Raphael pierced Soul Edge's eye, giving Siegfried the edge he needed to break free from Soul Edge's control once again.\n\nAfter waking up, Siegfried found the holy sword, free from its entrapment within the wicked sword, and out of instinct used it to pierce Soul Edge. The result led to both swords sealed together in a fateful embrace, an \"Embrace of Souls\". Siegfried took both weapons and started a quest to find a definitive way of sealing Soul Edge, but memories of his slaughters, plus the attacks of those resentful of the Azure Knight, drove his mind towards insanity. Unbeknownst to him, the evil soul of the blade escaped and obtained a temporary shell, starting a new killing spree to strengthen himself while seeking its body, Soul Edge.\n\nWhat neither of the two warriors knows is that a man behind the scenes is controlling their steps, searching to end an everlasting curse. And that many other warriors ventured in search of the blade as well.\n\nThe console version of the game was first released in North America on October 25, 2005. A soundtrack for the game was released as \"Soulcalibur III Original Soundtrack - Legend of Sounds\". Two guide books were released in Japan in November–December 2005: \"Famitsu\"'s \"Soul Calibur III Starting Guide Book\" and Namco's own \"Soul Calibur III Official Complete Guide\".\n\n\"Soulcalibur III: Arcade Edition\" is a re-tuned and glitch-fixed version of \"Soulcalibur III\" that was first released in the arcades on April 3, 2006. Almost the entire cast from the home version returns as playable characters except Abyss, who is now a non-playable boss character alongside Night Terror. From the 17 bonus characters only three made it into the arcade: Hwang Seong-gyeong, Li Long and Amy Sorel, who have been reworked and expanded into more deep playing styles. The total roster of the arcade ascends to 27 selectable characters.\n\nThe game has three different modes: Training Mode, where one can try the characters' moves for a set time; Standard Mode, which is a traditional arcade mode with nine battles in a row, without cut scenes or endings; and Legends Mode, a complex eight-round mode based upon the creation of and competition between customized characters with accumulated skills taken from the home version's Chronicles of the Sword mode, such as increased stamina or the ability to automatically escape grapples.\n\nThe Standard mode brings back Inferno as a sub boss character (Stage 8). The only difference is Inferno will now only use a move set similar to Cervantes instead of randomly doing the moves of any character. Your ending boss for the standard mode can be either Night Terror if you get through 8 stages fast, Abyss if you get through pretty fast, or the Highest ranked Legends mode character if you end up getting through standard mode rather slow (8 minutes or higher). The number of times you continue does not seem to affect the boss you receive but the amount of aggression you show towards your opponents seems like it might have an effect.\n\nThe game has generally positive reviews with an aggregate score of 86/100 on Metacritic. IGN lauded it for its \"stunning environment\" and \"charming characters\" but thought that the game could use more diverse sound effects. GameSpot praised the \"fun, fast-paced gameplay\" but criticized the lack of online play.\n\n\nIn 2011, \"Complex\" ranked it as the 34th best fighting game of all time.\n\n\"Soulcalibur III\" is part of the \"Universal Fighting System\" collectible card game, created by Sabertooth Games and later published by Fantasy Flight Games. It was one of the official founding franchises of the card game, next to \"Street Fighter\", when the game was released April 2006. \"UFS\" has seen five expansions based on \"Soulcalibur III\"'s characters and history.\n\n"}

September found \"Lardner\" off Gibraltar and in the Mediterranean, visiting various ports. \"Lardner\" departed for the United States towing , arriving at Philadelphia 12 July 1927. Between August 1927 and September 1929, \"Lardner\" continued operations along the Atlantic coast with annual winter cruises to the Caribbean, often training Naval Reservists.\n\n\"Lardner\" decommissioned at Philadelphia 1 May 1930, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, and was struck from the Navy Register 22 October 1930. She was sold for scrapping to the Boston Iron & Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, 17 January 1931.\n\n"}

Adaptive clothing typically offers rear-closure designs so that an individual can be dressed more easily by a carer or even by themselves. For example, rather than buttons and zippers, hidden magnets or Velcro may be used for garment and footwear closures. A common misconception of adaptive clothing is that it is only for wheelchair users or others that suffer from severe disabilities. Whilst these groups do benefit from the garments, adaptive clothing is for anyone that can be limited by traditional clothing. Adaptive clothing not only benefit the wearer but also the carer or health care professional to be more efficient and helps prevent potential back and shoulder injuries.\n\nAdaptive clothing is specialised clothing that is modified to enable easier dressing for people with a disability. The clothing is modified to help people with a high degree of disability and their carers or to assist individuals with a lower degree of disability to dress independently.\n\nAdaptive clothing typically incorporates flat seams to reduce friction, and discreet adaptations to make the clothing look as consistent with fashion norms as possible, including: easy access snaps, Velcro, stretchy fabric, roomy design to accommodate incontinence aids, longer rise in the back to accommodate sitting in wheelchairs, and elastic waist for increased comfort and easier dressing.\n\nFor individuals suffering from Parkinson's and other disabilities that affect motor skills, magnetic closures have emerged as a great solution across multiple garments. The original technology was developed by MagnaReady and was patented in December of 2015. The technology was licensed for numerous lines of adaptive clothing by brands including Van Heusen and MagnaClick. Magnetic closures again came to the forefront of adaptive clothing when Tommy Hilfiger featured magnetic closures prominently in the launch of their adaptive clothing line in the Spring of 2018. Silvert's Adaptive Clothing & Footwear also carry magnetic closure dress shirts for both men and women.\n"}
{"id": "2047222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047222", "title": "Filipino cuisine", "text": "Filipino cuisine\n\nFilipino cuisine () is composed of the cuisines of more than a hundred distinct ethno-linguistic groups found throughout the Philippine archipelago. However, a majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine are from the cuisines of the various ethnolinguistic groups and tribes of the archipelago, including the Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Tagalog, Bicolano, Visayan (Cebuano, Hiligaynon and Waray), Chavacano and Maranao ethno-linguistic groups. The style of food making and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their Austronesian origins (shared with Malaysian and Indonesian cuisines) to a mixed cuisine of Indian, Chinese, Spanish and American influences, in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate.\n\nDishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to fish curry, chicken curry, complex paellas and \"cozidos\" of Iberian origin created for \"fiestas\". Popular dishes include: \"lechón\" (whole roasted pig), \"longganisa\" (Philippine sausage), \"tapa\" (cured beef), \"torta\" (omelette), \"adobo\" (chicken or pork braised in garlic, vinegar, oil and soy sauce, or cooked until dry), \"dinuguan\" (pork blood stew), \"kaldereta\" (meat stewed in tomato sauce), \"mechado\" (larded beef in soy and tomato sauce), \"pochero\" (beef and bananas in tomato sauce), \"afritada\" (chicken or pork and vegetables simmered in tomato sauce), \"kare-kare\" (oxtail and vegetables cooked in peanut sauce), \"pinakbet\" (kabocha squash, eggplant, beans, okra, and tomato stew flavored with shrimp paste), \"crispy pata\" (deep-fried pig's leg), \"hamonado\" (pork sweetened in pineapple sauce), \"sinigang\" (meat or seafood in sour broth), \"pancit\" (noodles), and \"lumpia\" (fresh or fried spring rolls). Various food scholars have noted that Filipino cuisine is multi-faceted and is the most representative in the culinary world for food where \"east meets west\".\n\nDuring the pre-Hispanic era in the Philippines, the preferred Austronesian methods for food preparation were boiling, steaming and roasting. The ingredients for common dishes were obtained from locally raised livestock. These ranged from water buffalos/carabaos, chicken, and pigs to various kinds of fish and other seafood. In 3200 BCE, Austronesians from southern China (Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau) and Taiwan settled in the region that is now called the Philippines. They brought with them knowledge of rice cultivation and other farming practices which increased the number and variety of edible dish ingredients available for cooking.\n\nFilipino cuisine may be confusing to some people due to it being hard to determine what is actually Filipino. Confusion occurs due to the consistent growing phases of Filipino culture. Filipino culture has been constantly changing throughout history, gaining influence from various cultures and inevitably has evolved. Filipino food today has been shaped by history and society of many unique and affluent cultures. Influences from China, India, Arabia are seen throughout Filipino food and culture due to the agricultural trading of the times. Influences from Spain and the United States are seen through past colonization of the country. Filipino food can be studied and given a definition through the process of indigenizing its people throughout centuries.\n\nIndian influences can also be noted in rice-based delicacies such as \"bibingka\" (analogous to the Indonesian \"bingka\"), \"puto\", and \"puto bumbong\", where the latter two are plausibly derived from the south Indian \"puttu\", which also has variants throughout Maritime Southeast Asia (e.g. \"kue putu\", \"putu mangkok\"). The \"kare-kare\", more popular in Luzon, on the other hand could trace its origins from the Seven Years' War when the British occupied Manila for 2 years mostly with sepoys (Indian conscripts), who had to improvise Indian dishes given the lack of spices in the Philippines to make curry. This is said to explain the name and its supposed thick, yellow-to-orange annatto and peanut-based sauce, which alludes to a type of curry. \n\nAtchara originated from the Indian \"achar\", which was transmitted via the acar of the Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.\n\nThe Arab influence on Filipino cuisine is relatively minor. Historically, Arabs influence arrived via India to Indonesia to Philippines. In the earlier days, Arabs traded with Indians, who in turn traded with Southeast Asia. In the later era, with advancement of sea navigation, Arabs also started to trade directly with the Philippines. Example of Arab influence as Arabic dishes, such as \"kurmah\" and \"biryani\", popular in the Muslim areas of Mindanao.\n\nThe Chinese had been trading with the inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago since the early 9th or 10th centuries. Soon after, the Chinese began to immigrate there in the 16th century. Chinese influence is best seen in pancit noodles and lumpia spring rolls. There are also many ingredients such as soy sauce, black beans, tofu, pork, etc., that are seen in Filipino cooking. \n\nDirect trade and cultural exchange with Hokkien China in the Philippines in the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD) with porcelain, ceramics, and silk being traded for spices and trepang in Luzon. This early cultural contact with China introduced a number of staple food into Filipino cuisine, most notably \"toyo\" (soy sauce; ), \"tokwa\"; (tofu; ), \"toge\" (bean sprout; ), and \"patis\" (fish sauce), as well as the method of stir frying and making savory soup bases. Many of these food items and dishes retained their original Hokkien names, such as \"pancit\" ()(), and \"lumpia\" (). The food introduced during this period were food of the workers and traders, which became a staple of the noodle shops (\"panciterias\"), and can be seen in dishes like \"arroz caldo\" (congee), \"sinangag\" (fried rice).\n\nThe Spanish came to the Philippines and ruled its islands by 1565 until 1898. Filipinos began using the Spanish \"sofrito\" of tomatoes, onions, and garlic cooked in oil for their dishes. Many cooking customs and techniques were adapted as well as various dishes. \n\nSince the Spanish ruled both Mexico and the Philippines, the two were inevitably connected and they transported various goods between the two colonies. Spanish colonizers and friars in the 16th century brought with them produce from the New World such as chili peppers, chocolate, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, pineapples, bell peppers, jicama, chayote, avocado, peanuts, annatto and the method of sautéing with garlic and onions. Chili leaves are frequently used as a cooking green. The Mexicans received rice, sugarcane, tamarind, coconuts, and mangoes from the Philippine soil. \n\nHispanic dishes were eventually incorporated into Filipino cuisine with the more complex dishes usually being prepared for special occasions. Some dishes such as \"arroz a la valenciana\" remain largely the same in the Filipino context. Some have been adapted or have come to take on a slightly or significantly different meaning. \"Arroz a la cubana\" served in the Philippines usually includes ground beef picadillo. Philippine \"longganisa\" despite its name is more akin to \"chorizo\" than Spanish \"longaniza\" (in Visayan regions, it is still known as \"chorizo\"). \"Morcon\" likely refers to a beef roulade dish, not the bulbous specialty Spanish sausage.\n\nAfter the Spanish–American War in 1898, the United States controlled the Philippines due to the Treaty of Paris. US soldiers introduced Filipinos to hot dogs, hamburgers, fried chicken, and ice cream. They also introduced convenient foods such as spam, corned beef, instant coffee. and evaporated milk.\n\nToday, Filipino cuisine continues to evolve as new techniques and styles of cooking, and ingredients find their way into the country. Traditional dishes both simple and elaborate, indigenous and foreign-influenced, are seen as are more current popular international dishes and fast food fare. However, the Filipino diet is higher in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than other Asian diets.\n\nFilipino cuisine centres around the combination of sweet (\"tamis\"), sour (\"asim\"), and salty (\"alat\"), although in Bicol, the Cordilleras and among Muslim Filipinos, spicy (\"anghang\") is a base of cooking flavor.\n\nCounterpoint is a feature in Filipino cuisine which normally comes in a pairing of something sweet with something salty, and results in surprisingly pleasing combinations. Examples include: \"champorado\" (a sweet cocoa rice porridge), being paired with \"tuyo\" (salted, sun-dried fish); \"dinuguan\" (a savory stew made of pig's blood and innards), paired with \"puto\" (sweet, steamed rice cakes); unripe fruits such as green mangoes (which are only slightly sweet but very sour), are eaten dipped in salt or \"bagoong\"; the use of cheese (which is salty-sweet) in sweetcakes (such as \"bibingka\" and \"puto\"), as well as an ice cream flavoring.\n\nCooking and eating in the Philippines has traditionally been an informal and communal affair centered around the family kitchen. Food tends to be served all at once and not in courses.\n\nUnlike many of their Asian counterparts Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks. The traditional way of eating is with the hands, especially dry dishes such as \"inihaw\" or \"prito\". The diner will take a bite of the main dish, then eat rice pressed together with his fingers. This practice, known as \"kamayan\" (using the washed left hand for picking the centralized food and the right hand for bringing food to the mouth), is rarely seen in urbanized areas. However, Filipinos tend to feel the spirit of \"kamayan\" when eating amidst nature during out-of-town trips, beach vacations, and town fiestas.\n\nNowadays, the use of hands during eating, known as \"kamayan\", has become a trend. \"Kamayan\" generally means \"eating with your hands\", which was how Filipinos ate in pre-colonial era. It is further becoming more popular due to the incorporation of the \"boodle fight\" concept, a style of dining popularized by the Philippine Army, which utilizes banana leaves spread out on the table as the main serving platter, upon which is laid out portions of rice and a variety of Filipino dishes for friendly, filial or communal feasting. The use of spoons and forks, however, is still the norm.\n\nDuring the Spanish occupation, which yielded Western influences, Filipinos ate with the paired utensils of spoon and fork. The knife was not used as in other countries, because Spain prohibited them to have knives. Filipinos use the side of the spoon, to \"cut\" the food.\n\nDue to Western influence, food is often eaten using flatware—forks, knives, spoons—but the primary pairing of utensils used at a Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.\n\nFilipino cuisine has a variety of native ingredients used. The biota that developed yielded a particular landscape and in turn gave the place local ingredients that enhanced flavors to the dishes. Kalamansi is the more known of those ingredients, it is a fruit that belongs to the genus citrus. It is mostly used due to the sourness it gives to a dish. Another is the tabon-tabon, a tropical fruit which were used by pre-colonial Filipinos as anti-bacterial ingredient especially in Kinilaw dishes. \n\nThe country also cultivates different type of nuts and one of them is the pili nut, of which the Philippines is the only known exporter of edible varieties. It is usually made as a merienda or is incorporated in other desserts to enhance the flavor due to the milky texture it gives off as it melts in the mouth.\n\nVinegar is a common ingredient. \"Adobo\" is popular not solely for its simplicity and ease of preparation, but also for its ability to be stored for days without spoiling, and even improve in flavor with a day or two of storage. \"Tinapa\" is a smoke-cured fish while \"tuyo\", \"daing\", and \"dangit\" are corned, sun-dried fish popular because they can last for weeks without spoiling, even without refrigeration.\n\nFilipinos traditionally eat three main meals a day: \"almusal\" or \"agahan\" (breakfast), \"tanghalían\" (lunch), and \"hapunan\" (dinner) plus an afternoon snack called \"meryenda\" (also called \"minandál\" or \"minindál\"). \n\nA traditional Filipino breakfast might include \"pandesal\" (small bread rolls), \"kesong puti\" (fresh, unripened, white Filipino cheese, traditionally made from carabao's milk) \"champorado\" (chocolate rice porridge), \"silog\" which is \"sinangag\" (garlic fried rice) or sinaing, with fried egg and meat—such as \"tapa\", \"longganisa\", \"tocino\", \"karne norte\" (corned beef), or fish such as \"daing na bangus\" (salted and dried milkfish)—or \"itlog na pula\" (salted duck eggs). Coffee is also commonly served particularly \"kapeng barako\", a variety of coffee produced in the mountains of Batangas noted for having a strong flavor.\n\nCertain portmanteaus in Filipino have come into use to describe popular combinations of items in a Filipino breakfast. An example of such a combination order is \"kankamtuy\": an order of kanin\" (rice), kamatis\" (tomatoes) and tuyo\" (dried fish). Another is \"tapsi\": an order of tapa\" and sinangág\" or sinaing\". Other examples include variations using a \"silog\" suffix, usually some kind of meat served with sinangág\" or sinaing\", and \"itlog\" (egg). The three most commonly seen \"silogs\" are \"tapsilog\" (having \"tapa\" as the meat portion), \"tocilog\" (having tocino as the meat portion), and \"longsilog\" (having longganisa as the meat portion). Other \"silogs\" include \"hotsilog\" (with a hot dog), \"bangsilog\" (with \"bangus\" (milkfish)), \"dangsilog\" (with \"danggit\" (rabbitfish)), \"spamsilog\" (with spam), \"adosilog\" (with adobo), \"chosilog\" (with chorizo), \"chiksilog\" (with chicken), \"cornsilog\" (with corned beef), and \"litsilog\" (with lechon/litson). \"Pankaplog\" is slang for a breakfast consisting of \"pandesal\", \"kape\" (coffee), and \"itlog\" (egg), it is also a double entendre meaning to fondle breasts. An establishment that specializes in such meals is called a \"tapsihan\" or \"tapsilugan\".\n\nUsually, either breakfast or lunch is the largest meal. \n\nDinner, while still the main meal, is smaller than other countries.\n\n\"Merienda\" is taken from the Spanish, and is a light meal or snack especially in the afternoon, similar to the concept of afternoon tea. If the meal is taken close to dinner, it is called \"merienda cena\", and may be served instead of dinner.\n\nFilipinos have a number of options to take with \"kapé\", which is the Filipino pronunciation of café (coffee): breads and pastries like \"pandesal\", \"ensaymada\" (buttery \"brioche\" covered in grated cheese and sugar), \"hopia\" (pastries similar to mooncakes filled with mung bean paste) and empanada (savoury, meat-filled pasties). Also popular are \"kakanín\", or traditional pastries made from sticky rice like \"kutsinta\", \"sapin-sapin\" (multicoloured, layered pastry), \"palitaw\", \"biko\", \"suman\", \"Bibingka\", and \"pitsi-pitsî\" (served with desiccated coconut).\n\nSavoury dishes often eaten during \"merienda\" include \"pancit canton\" (stir-fried noodles), \"palabok\" (rice noodles with a shrimp-based sauce), \"tokwa't baboy\" (fried tofu with boiled pork ears in a garlic-flavored soy sauce and vinegar dressing), and \"dinuguan\" (a spicy stew made of pork blood), which is often served with \"puto\" (steamed rice flour cakes).\n\nDim sum and dumplings, brought to the islands by Fujianese migrants, have been given a Filipino touch and are also popular \"merienda\" fare. Street food, such as squid balls and fish balls, are often skewered on bamboo sticks and consumed with soy sauce and the sour juice of the calamondin as condiments.\n\n\"Pulutan\" (from the Filipino word \"pulutin\" which literally means \"to pick something up\") is a term roughly analogous to the English term \"finger food\" or Spanish Tapas. Originally, it was a snack accompanied with liquor or beer but has found its way into Filipino cuisine as appetizers or, in some cases, main dishes, as in the case of \"sisig\".\nDeep fried \"pulutan\" include \"chicharrón\" (also spelled \"chicharon\" or \"tsitsaron\"), pork rinds that have been boiled and then twice fried, the second frying gives the crunchiness and golden color; \"chicharong bituka\", pig intestines that have been deep fried to a crisp; \"chicharong bulaklak\", similar to \"chicharong bituka\" it is made from mesenteries of pig intestines and has an appearance roughly resembling a flower, hence the \"bulaklak\" name; and \"chicharong manok\", chicken skin that has been deep fried until crisp. Other examples of deep fried pulutan are crispy crablets, crispy frog legs, \"chicharong isda\" or fish skin cracklings, and \"tugnas\" or deep fried pork fat (also known as \"pinaigi\"). \n\nExamples of grilled foods include: \"isaw,\" or chicken or pig intestines skewered and then grilled; \"Inihaw na tenga\", pig ears that have been skewered and then grilled; \"pork barbecue,\" skewered pork marinated in a sweet soy-garlic blend and then grilled; \"betamax\", salted solidified pork or chicken blood which is then skewered and lightly grilled; \"adidas\" which is grilled or sautéed chicken feet. There is also \"sisig\", a popular \"pulutan\" made from the pig's cheek skin, ears and liver that is initially boiled, then charcoal grilled and afterwards minced and cooked with chopped onions, chillies, and spices.\n\nSmaller snacks such as \"mani\" (peanuts) are often sold steamed in the shell, salted, spiced or flavored with garlic by street vendors in the Philippines. Another snack is \"kropeck\", which is fish crackers.\n\n\"Tokwa't baboy\" is fried tofu with boiled pork marinated in a garlic-flavored soy sauce or vinegar dip. It is also served as a side dish to \"pancit luglog\" or \"pancit palabok\".\n\nYou can also find \"tuhog-tuhog\" accompanied by \"sweet\" or \"spicy sauce.\" This include \"Fish balls, Kikiam, Squid balls etc.,\" these are commonly served during a small gathering or in local bars.\n\nFor festive occasions, people band together and prepare more sophisticated dishes. Tables are often laden with expensive and labor-intensive treats requiring hours of preparation. In Filipino celebrations, \"lechón\" (also spelled \"litson\") serves as the centerpiece of the dinner table. It is usually a whole roasted pig, but suckling pigs (\"lechonillo\", or \"lechon de leche\") or cattle calves (\"lechong baka\") can also be prepared in place of the popular adult pig. It is typically served with \"lechon\" sauce, which is traditionally made from the roasted pig's liver. Other dishes include \"hamonado\" (honey-cured beef, pork or chicken), \"relleno\" (stuffed chicken or milkfish), \"mechado\", \"afritada\", \"caldereta\", \"puchero\", paella, \"menudo\", \"morcon\", \"embutido\" (referring to a meatloaf dish, not a sausage as understood elsewhere), \"suman\" (a savory rice and coconut milk concoction steamed in leaves such as banana), and \"pancit canton\". The table may also be have various sweets and pastries such as \"leche flan\", \"ube\", \"sapin-sapin\", \"sorbetes\" (ice creams), \"totong\" or \"sinukmani\" (a rice, coconut milk and mongo bean pudding), \"ginataan\" (a coconut milk pudding with various root vegetables and tapioca pearls), and \"gulaman\" (an agar jello-like ingredient or dessert).\n\nChristmas Eve, known as \"Noche Buena\", is the most important feast. During this evening, the star of the table is the Christmas ham and Edam cheese (\"queso de bola\"). Supermarkets are laden with these treats during the Christmas season and are popular giveaways by Filipino companies in addition to red wine, brandy, groceries, or pastries. Available mostly during the Christmas season and sold in front of churches along with \"bibingka\", \"puto bumbong\" is purple colored ground sticky rice steamed vertically in small bamboo tubes.\n\nMore common at celebrations than in everyday home meals, \"lumpiang sariwa\", or \"fresh lumpia\", is a fresh spring roll that consists of a soft crepe wrapped around a filling that can include strips of \"kamote\" (sweet potato), \"singkamas\" (jicama), bean sprouts, green beans, cabbage, carrots and meat (often pork). It can be served warm or cold and typically with a sweet peanut and garlic sauce. \"Ukoy\" is shredded papaya combined with small shrimp (and occasionally bean sprouts) and fried to make shrimp patties. It is often eaten with vinegar seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper. Both \"lumpiang sariwa\" and \"ukoy\" are often served together in Filipino parties. \"Lumpiang sariwa\" has Chinese origins, having been derived from popiah.\n\nFilipino food is widely shaped by individual traditions and customs. The same dish may and will differ between households. A dish prepared by your mother might be completely different from your aunts.\n\nAs in most Asian countries, the staple food in the Philippines is rice. It is most often steamed and always served with meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Leftover rice is often fried with garlic to make \"sinangag\", which is usually served at breakfast together with a fried egg and cured meat or sausages. Rice is often enjoyed with the sauce or broth from the main dishes. In some regions, rice is mixed with salt, condensed milk, cocoa, or coffee. Rice flour is used in making sweets, cakes and other pastries. Sticky rice with cocoa, also called \"champorado\" is also a common dish served with \"tuyo\" or dried herring.\n\nRice and coconuts as staples throughout the archipelago as in the rest of Southeast Asia meant similar or adopted dishes and methods based on these crops. Some of these are evident in the infusion of coconut milk particularly in the renowned \"laing\" and \"sinilihan\" (popularized as Bicol Express) of Bikol. Other regional variants of stews or soups commonly tagged as \"ginataan(g)\" or \"with coconut milk\" also abound Filipino kitchens and food establishments. A dish from the Visayas simmered in coconut water, ideally in bamboo, is the \"binakol\" usually with chicken as the main ingredient.\nA variety of fruits and vegetables are often used in cooking. Plantains (also called \"saba\" in Filipino), kalamansi, guavas (\"bayabas\"), mangoes, papayas, and pineapples lend a distinctly tropical flair in many dishes, but mainstay green leafy vegetables like water spinach (\"kangkong\"), Chinese cabbage (\"petsay\"), Napa cabbage (\"petsay wombok\"), cabbage (\"repolyo\") and other vegetables like eggplants (\"talong\") and yard-long beans (\"sitaw\") are just as commonly used. Coconuts are ubiquitous. Coconut meat is often used in desserts, coconut milk (\"kakang gata\") in sauces, and coconut oil for frying. Abundant harvests of root crops like potatoes, carrots, taro (\"gabi\"), cassava (\"kamoteng kahoy\"), purple yam (\"ube\"), and sweet potato (\"kamote\") make them readily available. The combination of tomatoes (\"kamatis\"), garlic (\"bawang\"), and onions (\"sibuyas\") is found in many dishes.\nMeat staples include chicken, pork, beef, and fish. Seafood is popular as a result of the bodies of water surrounding the archipelago. Popular catches include tilapia, catfish (\"hito\"), milkfish (\"bangus\"), grouper (\"lapu-lapu\"), shrimp (\"hipon\"), prawns (\"sugpo\"), mackerel (\"galunggong\", \"hasa-hasa\"), swordfish (\"isdang-ispada\"), oysters (\"talaba\"), mussels (\"tahong\"), clams (\"halaan\" and \"tulya\"), large and small crabs (\"alimango\" and \"alimasag\" respectively), game fish, sablefish, tuna, cod (\"bakalaw\"), blue marlin, and squid/cuttlefish (both called \"pusit\"). Also popular are seaweeds (\"damong dagat\"), abalone, and eel (\"igat\").\n\nThe most common way of having fish is to have it salted, pan-fried or deep-fried, and then eaten as a simple meal with rice and vegetables. It may also be cooked in a sour broth of tomatoes or tamarind as in \"pangat\", prepared with vegetables and a souring agent to make \"sinigang\", simmered in vinegar and peppers to make \"paksiw\", or roasted over hot charcoalor wood (\"inihaw\"). Other preparations include \"escabeche\" (sweet and sour), \"relleno\" (deboned and stuffed), or \"kinilaw\" (similar to ceviche; marinated in vinegar or kalamansi). Fish can be preserved by being smoked (\"tinapa\") or sun-dried (\"tuyo\" or \"daing\").\n\nFood is often served with various dipping sauces. Fried food is often dipped either in vinegar with onions, soy sauce with juice squeezed from \"Kalamansi\" (Philippine lime or \"calamansi\"). \"Patis\" (fish sauce) may be mixed with \"kalamansi\" as dipping sauce for most seafood or mixed with a stew called nilaga. Fish sauce, fish paste (\"bagoong\"), shrimp paste (\"bagoong alamang\") and crushed ginger root (\"luya\") are condiments that are often added to dishes during the cooking process or when served.\n\n\"Adobo\" is one of the most popular Filipino dishes and is considered unofficially by many as the national dish. It usually consists of pork or chicken, sometimes both, stewed or braised in a sauce usually made from vinegar, cooking oil, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, and soy sauce. It can also be prepared \"dry\" by cooking out the liquid and concentrating the flavor. \"Bistek\", also known as \"Filipino beef steak,\" consists of thinly sliced beef marinated in soy sauce and calamansi and then fried in a skillet that is typically served with onions.\n\nSome well-known stews are \"kare-kare\" and \"dinuguan\". In \"kare-kare\", also known as \"peanut stew\", oxtail or ox tripe is the main ingredient and is cooked with vegetables in a peanut-based preparation. It is typically served with \"bagoong\" (fermented shrimp paste). In \"dinuguan\", pig's blood, entrails, and meat are cooked with vinegar and seasoned with chili peppers, usually \"siling mahaba\".\n\n\"Paksiw\" refers to different vinegar-based stews that differ greatly from one another based on the type of meat used. \"Paksiw na isda\" uses fish and usually includes the addition of ginger, fish sauce, and maybe \"siling mahaba\" and vegetables. \"Paksiw na baboy\" is a \"paksiw\" using pork, usually pork hocks, and often sees the addition of sugar, banana blossoms, and water so that the meat is stewed in a sweet sauce. A similar Visayan dish called \"humba\" adds fermented black beans. Both dishes are probably related to \"pata tim\" which is of Chinese origin. \"Paksiw na lechon\" is made from \"lechon\" meat and features the addition of ground liver or liver spread. This adds flavor and thickens the sauce so that it starts to caramelize around the meat by the time dish is finished cooking. Although some versions of \"paksiw\" dishes are made using the same basic ingredients as \"adobo\", they are prepared differently, with other ingredients added and the proportions of ingredients and water being different.\n\nIn \"crispy pata\", pork knuckles (known as \"pata\") are marinated in garlic-flavored vinegar then deep fried until crisp and golden brown, with other parts of the pork leg prepared in the same way. \"Lechon manok\" is the Filipino take on rotisserie chicken. Available in many hole-in-the-wall stands or restaurant chains (e.g. Andok's, Baliwag, Toto's, Sr. Pedro's, G.S. Pagtakhan's), it is typically a specially seasoned chicken roasted over a charcoal flame served with \"\"sarsa\"\" or \"lechon\" sauce made from mashed pork liver, starch, sugar, and spices.\n\n\"Mechado\", \"kaldereta\", and \"afritada\" are Spanish influenced tomato sauce-based dishes that are somewhat similar to one another. In these dishes meat is cooked in tomato sauce, minced garlic, and onions. \"Mechado\" gets its name from the pork fat that is inserted in a slab of beef making it look like a wick (\"mitsa\") coming out of a beef \"candle\". The larded meat is then cooked in a seasoned tomato sauce and later sliced and served with the sauce it was cooked in. \"Kaldereta\" can be beef but is also associated with goat. Chunks of meat are cooked in tomato sauce, minced garlic, chopped onions, peas, carrots, bell peppers and potatoes to make a stew with some recipes calling for the addition of soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, chilies, ground liver or some combination thereof. \"Afritada\" tends to be the name given to the dish when chicken and pork is used. Another similar dish said to originate from the Rizal area is \"waknatoy\". Pork or beef sirloin is combined with potatoes and cut sausages and cooked in a tomato-based sauce sweetened with pickles. \"Puchero\" is derived from the Spanish \"cocido\"; it is a sweeter stew that has beef and banana or plantain slices simmered in tomato sauce.\n\nFilipinos also eat \"tocino\" and \"longganisa\". \"Tocino\" is a sweetened cured meat made with either chicken or pork and is marinated and cured for a number of days before being fried. \"Longganisa\" is a sweet or spicy sausage, typically made from pork though other meats can also be used, and are often colored red traditionally through the use of the anatto seed but also artificial food coloring.\n\nFilipino soups tend to be very hearty and stew-like containing large chunks of meat and vegetables or noodles. They are usually intended to be filling and not meant to be a light preparatory introduction for the main course. They tend to be served with the rest of the meal and eaten with rice when they are not meals unto themselves. They are often referred to on local menus under the heading \"sabaw\" (broth). \"Sinigang\" is a popular dish in this category distinguished by its sourness that often vies with \"adobo\" for consideration as the national dish. It is typically made with either pork, beef, chicken or seafood and made sour with tamarind or other suitable souring ingredients. Some seafood variants for example can be made sour by the use of guava fruit or miso. Another dish is \"tinola\". It has large chicken pieces and green papaya/sayote slices cooked with chili, spinach, and moringa leaves in a ginger-flavored broth. \"Nilagang baka\" is a beef stew made with cabbages and other vegetables. \"Binacol\" is a warm chicken soup cooked with coconut water and served with strips of coconut meat. \"La Paz batchoy\" is a noodle soup garnished with pork innards, crushed pork cracklings, chopped vegetables, and topped with a raw egg. Another dish with the same name uses misua, beef heart, kidneys and intestines, but does not contain eggs or vegetables. \"Mami\" is a noodle soup made from chicken, beef, pork, wonton dumplings, or intestines (called \"laman-loob\"). Ma Mon Luk was known for it. Another chicken noodle soup is \"sotanghon\", consisting of cellophane noodles (also called \"sotanghon\" and from whence the name of the dish is derived), chicken, and sometimes mushrooms.\nNoodle dishes are generally called \"pancit\". \"Pancit\" recipes primarily consist of noodles, vegetables, and slices of meat or shrimp with variations often distinguished by the type of noodles used. Some \"pancit\", such as \"mami\" and La Paz-styled \"batchoy\", are noodle soups while the \"dry\" varieties are comparable to \"chow mein\" in preparation. Then there is spaghetti or \"ispageti\" in the local parlance that is a modified version of spaghetti bolognese. It is sometimes made with banana ketchup instead of tomato sauce, sweetened with sugar and topped with hot dog slices.\n\nThere are several rice porridges that are popular in the Philippines. One is \"arroz caldo\", which is a rice porridge cooked with chicken, ginger and sometimes saffron, garnished with spring onions (chives), toasted garlic, and coconut milk to make a type of gruel. Another variant is \"goto\" which is an \"arroz caldo\" made with ox tripe. There is also another much different rice porridge called \"champorado\" which is sweet and flavored with chocolate and often served at breakfast paired with \"tuyo\" or \"daing\".\n\nAnother rice-based dish is \"arroz a la valenciana\", a Spanish paella named after the Spanish region Valencia that has been incorporated into the local cuisine. \"Bringhe\" is a local rice dish with some similarities to paella but using glutinous rice, coconut milk, and turmeric. \"Kiampong\" a type of fried rice topped with pork pieces, chives and peanuts. It can be found in Chinese restaurants in Binondo and Manila. \"Camaron rebosado con jamon\" has been described as a classic dish in the Binondo district of Manila, the city's Chinatown.\n\nFor vegetarians, there is \"dinengdeng\", a dish consisting of moringa leaves (\"malunggay\") and slices of bittermelon. There is also \"pinakbet\", stewed vegetables heavily flavored with \"bagoong\". A type of seafood salad known as \"kinilaw\" is made up of raw seafood such as fish or shrimp cooked only by steeping in local vinegar, sometimes with coconut milk, onions, spices and other local ingredients. It is comparable to the Peruvian ceviche.\n\nThe Filipino words commonly used for cooking methods and terms are listed below:\nIn a typical Filipino bakery, \"pandesal\", \"monay\" and \"ensaymada\" are often sold. \"Pandesal\" comes from the Spanish \"pan de sal\" (literally, bread of salt), and is a ubiquitous breakfast fare, normally eaten with (and sometimes even dipped in) coffee. It typically takes the form of a bread roll, and is usually baked covered in bread crumbs. Contrary to what its name implies, \"pandesal\" is not particularly salty as very little salt is used in baking it. \"Monay\" is a firmer slightly denser heavier bread. \"Ensaymada\", from the Spanish \"ensaimada\", is a pastry made using butter and often topped with sugar and shredded cheese that is especially popular during Christmas. It is sometimes made with fillings such as \"ube\" (purple yam) and \"macapuno\" (a variety of coconut the meat of which is often cut into strings, sweetened, preserved, and served in desserts). Also commonly sold in Filipino bakeries is \"pan de coco\", a sweet roll filled with shredded coconut mixed with molasses. \"Putok\" (also known in some localities as \"star bread\" or \"pinagong\"), which literally means \"explode\", refers to a small, hard bread roll whose cratered surface is glazed with sugar. \"Kababayan\" (Filipino muffins) is a small, sweet gong-shaped muffin that has a moist consistency. \"Spanish bread\" (nothing to do with the Spanish bread of Spain – \"Pan de Horno\") refers to a rolled pastry which looks like a croissant prior to being given a crescent shape, and has a filling consisting of sugar and butter.\n\nThere are also rolls like \"pianono\", which is a chiffon roll flavored with different fillings. \"Brazo de mercedes\", a rolled cake or jelly roll, is made from a sheet of meringue rolled around a custard filling. Similar to the previous dessert, it takes on a layered presentation instead of being rolled and typically features caramelized sugar and nuts for \"sans rival\". \"Silvañas\" are large, oval-shaped, cookie-sized desserts, with a thin meringue on either side of a buttercream filling and dusted with crumbed cookies. Not overly sweet, they are rich, crisp, chewy, and buttery all at the same time. \"Barquillos\" use sweet thin crunchy wafers rolled into tubes that can be sold hollow or filled with \"polvoron\" (sweetened and toasted flour mixed with ground nuts). Meringues are also present in the Philippines, due to the Spanish influence, but they are called \"merengue\" – with all the vowels pronounced. \"Leche flan\" is a type of caramel custard made with eggs and milk similar to the French creme caramel. \"Leche flan\" (the local term for the original Spanish \"flan de leche\", literally \"milk flan\") is a heavier version of the Spanish flan made with condensed milk and more egg yolks. \"Leche flan\" is usually steamed over an open flame or stove top, although on rare occasions it can also be seen baked. \"Leche flan\" is a staple in celebratory feasts.\n\nA heavier version of \"leche flan\", \"tocino del cielo\", is similar, but has significantly more egg yolks and sugar.\nThe \"egg pie\" with a very rich egg custard filling is a mainstay in local bakeries. It is typically baked so that the exposed custard on top is browned. \"Buko\" pie is made with a filling made from young coconut meat and dairy. Mini pastries like \"turrones de casuy\" are made up of cashew marzipan wrapped with a wafer made to resemble a candy wrapper but take on a miniature look of a pie in a size of about a quarter. There is also \"napoleones\" – again with all the vowels pronounced – a mille-feuille pastry stuffed with a sweet milk-based filling.\n\nThere are hard pastries like \"biskotso\" a crunchy, sweet, twice-baked bread. Another baked goody is \"sinipit\" which is a sweet pastry covered in a crunchy sugar glaze, made to resemble a length of rope. Similar to \"sinipit\" is a snack eaten on roadsides colloquially called \"shingaling\". It is hollow but crunchy with a salty flavor.\nFor a softer treat there is \"mamon\" a chiffon-type cake sprinkled with sugar, its name derived from a slang Spanish term for breast. There's also \"crema de fruta\", which is an elaborate sponge cake topped in succeeding layers of cream, custard, candied fruit, and gelatin. Similar to a sponge cake is \"mamoncillo\" which generally refers to slices taken from a large \"mamon cake\", but it is unrelated to the fruit of the same name. Sandwich pastries like \"inipit\" are made with two thin layers of chiffon sandwiching a filling of custard that is topped with butter and sugar. Another \"mamon\" variant is \"mamon tostada\", basically \"mamoncillo\" toasted to a crunchy texture.\n\nStuffed pastries that reflect both Western and Eastern influence are common. One can find empanadas, a turnover-type pastry filled with a savory-sweet meat filling. Typically filled with ground meat and raisins, it can be deep fried or baked. \"Siopao\" is the local version of Chinese baozi. \"Buchi\" is another snack that is likely of Chinese origin. Bite-sized, \"buchi\" is made of deep-fried dough balls (often from rice flour) filled with a sweet mung bean paste, and coated on the outside with sesame seeds; some variants also have \"ube\" as the filling. There are also many varieties of the mooncake-like \"hopia\", which come in different shapes (from a flat, circular stuffed form, to cubes), and have different textures (predominantly using flaky pastry, but sometimes like the ones in mooncakes) and fillings.\n\n\"Itlog na pula\" (red eggs) are duck eggs that have been cured in brine or a mixture of clay-and-salt for a few weeks, making them salty. They are later hard boiled and dyed with red food coloring (hence the name) to distinguish them from chicken eggs before they are sold over the shelves. They are often served mixed in with diced tomatoes. \"Atchara\" is a side dish of pickled papaya strips similar to sauerkraut. It's a frequent accompaniment to fried dishes like \"tapa\" or \"daing\".\n\n\"Nata de coco\" is a chewy, translucent, jelly-like food product produced by the fermentation of coconut water can be served with \"pandesal\". \"Kesong puti\" is a soft white cheese made from carabao milk (although cow milk is also used in most commercial variants). Grated mature coconut (\"niyog\"), is normally served with sweet rice-based desserts.\n\nChilled drinks are popular due to the tropical climate. Stands selling cold fruit drinks and fruit shakes are common in many of the city areas, where some are based on green mandarin orange (\"dalandan\" or \"dalanghita\"), pomelo (\"suha\"), pineapple (\"pinya\"), banana (\"saging\"), and soursop (\"guyabano\"). The shakes usually contain crushed ice, evaporated or condensed milk, and fruits like the perennially popular mango. Other fruits are avocado, cantaloupe, durian, papaya, strawberry and watermelon, to name a few.\n\nOther chilled drinks include \"sago't gulaman,\" a flavored ice drink of pre-Hispanic Malay origin (Malay: \"gula melaka\") with sago and agar gelatin with banana extract sometimes added to the accompanying syrup; fresh \"buko\" or coconut juice, the water or juice straight out of a young coconut via an inserted straw, a less fresh variation of which is from bottled coconut juice, scraped coconut flesh, sugar, and water; and kalamansi juice, the juice of kalamansi or Philippine limes usually sweetened with honey, syrup or sugar.\n\nThe Philippines is a predominantly coffee-drinking nation. One of the most popular variants of coffee coming from the mountains of Batangas is known as \"kapeng barako\". Another well-known variant of coffee is the \"civet coffee\". It is called \"kape motit\" in the Cordilleras, \"kape alamid\" in Tagalog region, and \"kape musang\" in Mindanao. The Kalinga coffee known for its organic production is also rapidly gaining popularity. Highlands coffee, or Benguet coffee, is a blend of Robusta and Excelsa beans.\n\nEven before the establishment of coffeehouses in the Philippines, coffee has been part of the Filipino meal. Carinderias would often serve them along with meals. The opening of Starbucks in 1997 paved the way for other coffee shops.\n\nTea consumption in the Philippines is driven primarily by growing health consciousness amongst middle- to high-income consumers. Tea is commonly prepared using Philippine wild tea or tea tree. There are several known variations of tea using different additives. Pandan iced tea is one of these, made with pandan leaves and lemongrass (locally known as \"tanglad\"). \"Salabat\", sometimes called ginger tea, is brewed from ginger root and usually served during the cold months, and when illnesses such as flu or sore throat strikes.\n\nThe late 2010s saw the opening of teahouses in major cities, and with a glass of milk tea being more affordable than the usual cold designer coffee, it paved the way into making tea a well-known food trend. Notable teahouse chains in the Philippines are Chatime and Serenitea.\n\n\"Tsokolate\" is the Filipino style of hot chocolate. It is traditionally made with \"tablea\", which are pure cacao beans that are dried, roasted, ground and then formed into tablets. It is also popular during Christmas season, particularly among children.\n\nThere are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks in the Philippines manufactured by local breweries and distilleries.\n\n\"Tuba\" (toddy) is a type of hard liquor made from fresh drippings extracted from a cut young stem of palm. The cutting of the palm stem usually done early in the morning by a \"mananguete\", a person who climbs palm trees and extracts the \"tuba\" to supply to customers later in the day. The morning's accumulated palm juice or drippings are then harvested by noon, and brought to buyers then prepared for consumption. Sometimes this is done twice a day so that there are two harvests of \"tuba\" occurring first at noon-time and then in the late-afternoon. Normally, \"tuba\" has to be consumed right after the \"mananguete\" brings it over, or it becomes too sour to be consumed as a drink. Any remaining unconsumed \"tuba\" is then often stored in jars to ferment for several days and become palm vinegar. \"Tuba\" can be distilled to produce \"lambanog\" (arrack), a neutral liquor often noted for its relatively high alcohol content.\n\nLambanog is an alcoholic beverage commonly described as coconut wine or coconut vodka. The drink is distilled from the sap of the unopened coconut flower, and is known for its potency and high alcohol content (80 and 90 proof). Most of the Lambanog distilleries are in the Quezon province of Luzon, Philippines. Constant efforts at standardizing lambanog production has led to its better quality. Presently, lambanog is being exported to other countries and continues to win foreign customers over due to its natural ingredients as well as its potency.\n\n\"Tapuy\" is a traditional Philippine alcoholic drink made from fermented \"glutinous rice\". It is a clear wine of luxurious alcoholic taste, moderate sweetness and lingering finish. Its average alcohol content is 14% or 28 proof, and it does not contain any preservatives or sugar. To increase the awareness of \"tapuy\", the Philippine Rice Research Institute has created a cookbook containing recipes and cocktails from famous Filipino chefs and bartenders, featuring \"tapuy\" as one of the ingredients.\n\nBeer or \"serbesa\" (from the Spanish \"cerveza\") is the most widely available alcoholic drink in the Philippines. San Miguel Pale Pilsen is the most popular and widely sold brand. Together with associated San Miguel beer brands such as San Mig Light and Gold Eagle Beer the company holds an aggregate market share of 92.7%. Beer na Beer produced by local conglomerate Asia Brewery is another widely sold pale Pilsner style beer. Asia Brewery also produces under license and distributes a number of other mass market beers such as Colt 45, Asahi Super Dry, Heineken and Tiger Beer. Other beer labels include Red Horse Beer, Lone Star, Lone Star Light, Lone Star Ultra, Carlsberg, Coors Light, San Miguel Superdry, San Mig Strong Ice, and just recently, Manila Beer. Echoing trends in international markets, bars in urban areas have also begun to serve locally produced and imported craft beers in a variety of styles.\n\nRum is often associated with Tanduay.\n\nSeveral gins, both local varieties like Ginebra San Miguel (as well as GSM Blue and GSM Premium Gin) and imported brands like Gilbey's, are commonly found. Some people refer to gin by the shape of the bottle: \"bilog\" for a circular bottle and \"kwatro kantos\" (literally meaning four corners) for a square or rectangular bottle. Gin is sometimes combined with other ingredients to come up with variations.\n\nAs the Philippines is a tropical country, it should come as no surprise that there are many treats made from rice and coconuts. One often seen dessert is \"bibingka\", a hot rice cake optionally topped with a pat of butter, slices of \"kesong puti\" (white cheese), \"itlog na maalat\" (salted duck eggs), and sometimes grated coconut. There are also glutinous rice sweets called \"biko\" made with sugar, butter, and coconut milk. In addition, there is a dessert known as \"bitsu-bitsu,\" also known as a Pinoy donut, made with fried rice flour which is then coated with Muscovado sugar syrup. There is also Karioka, made from glutinous rice flour, coconut, and coconut milk, fried and skewered and slathered with a brown sugar glaze. Another brown rice cake is \"kutsinta\".\n\n\"Puto\" is another well-known example of sweet steamed rice cakes prepared in many different sizes and colors. \"Sapin-sapin\" (sapin means layer) are three-layered, tri-colored sweets made with rice flour, purple yam, and coconut milk characterized by its gelatinous appearance. \"Palitaw\" are rice patties that are covered with sesame seeds, sugar, and coconut; \"pisti-pisti\" which are cassava patties coated with cheese or coconut; and \"tibok-tibok\" is based on carabao milk as a de leche (similar to maja blanca). As a snack, \"binatog\" is created with corn kernels with shredded coconut. Packaged snacks wrapped in banana or palm leaves then steamed, \"suman\" are made from sticky rice.\nFor cold desserts there is \"halo-halo\" which can be described as a dessert made with shaved ice, milk, and sugar with additional ingredients like coconut, \"ube halaya\" (mashed purple yam) or ube ice cream, \"leche flan\" or caramel custard, plantains, jackfruit, red beans, tapioca and \"pinipig\" being typical. Some of the Philippines' largest restaurant chains, such as \"Kuya J\", have dedicated dessert menus filled with many traditional Filipino desserts.\n\nOther similar treats made with shaved ice include \"saba con yelo\" which is shaved ice served with milk and \"minatamis na saging\" (ripe plantains chopped and caramelized with brown sugar); \"mais con yelo\" which is shaved ice served with steamed corn kernels, sugar, and milk; and \"buko pandan\" sweetened grated strips of coconut with gulaman, milk, and the juice or extract from pandan leaves. \"Sorbetes\" (ice cream) is popular, as well, with some local versions utilizing coconut milk instead of cow milk. Ice candy, are popular frozen snacks usually made from fruit juice, chocolate or local ingredients such as mung beans and ube. It can be any kind of flavor depending on the maker; chocolate and \"buko\" (coconut) flavored ice candy are two of the most popular. Another dessert, often served during Christmas and New Year's Eve, is mango float, a dessert composed of Graham cracker, mangoes, cream and milk, and created by layering them together in a dish and then refrigerating or blast chilling.\n\nThe Philippine islands are home to various ethnic groups resulting in varied regional cuisines.\n\nIlocanos from the mountainous Ilocos Region commonly have diets heavy in boiled or steamed vegetables and freshwater fish, and they are particularly fond of dishes flavored with \"bagoong\", fermented fish that is often used as a substitute for salt. Ilocanos often season boiled vegetables with \"bagoong monamon\" (fermented anchovy paste) to produce \"pinakbet\". Local specialties include the soft white larvae of ants and \"jumping salad\" of tiny live shrimp.\n\nThe Igorot prefer roasted meats, particularly carabao meat, goat meat, and venison.\n\nDue to its mild, sub-tropical climate, Baguio, along with the outlying mountainous regions, is renowned for its produce. Temperate-zone fruits and vegetables (strawberries being a notable example) which would otherwise wilt in lower regions are grown there. It is also known for a snack called \"sundot-kulangot\" which literally means \"poke the booger.\" It is a sticky kind of sweet made from milled glutinous rice flour mixed with molasses, and served inside \"pitogo\" shells, and with a stick to \"poke\" its sticky substance with.\n\nIsabela is known for Pancit Cabagan of Cabagan, Inatata & Binallay of Ilagan City are rice cakes prepared year-round in the city and both famous delicacies specially during the lenten season. Cagayan for its famous Carabao Milk Candy in the town Alcala and Tuguegarao City for Pancit Batil Patung and Buko Roll.\n\nThe town of Calasiao in Pangasinan is known for its \"puto\", a type of steamed rice cake.\n\nKapampangan cuisine makes use of all the produce in the region available to the native cook. Among the treats produced in Pampanga are \"longganisa\" (original sweet and spicy sausages), \"calderetang kambing\" (savory goat stew), and \"tocino\" (sweetened cured pork). Combining pork cheeks and offal, Kapampangans make \"sisig\".\n\nThe cuisine of the Tagalog people varies by province. Bulacan is popular for Chicharrón (pork rinds) and steamed rice and tuber cakes like \"puto\". It is a center for \"panghimagas\" or desserts, like brown rice cake or \"kutsinta\", \"sapin-sapin\", \"suman\", cassava cake, \"ube halaya\" and the king of sweets, in San Miguel, Bulacan, the famous carabao milk candy \"pastillas de leche\", with its \"pabalat\" wrapper. Cainta, in Rizal province east of Manila, is known for its Filipino rice cakes and puddings. These are usually topped with \"latik\", a mixture of coconut milk and brown sugar, reduced to a dry crumbly texture. A more modern, and time saving alternative to \"latik\" are coconut flakes toasted in a frying pan. Antipolo City, straddled mid-level in the mountainous regions of the Philippine Sierra Madre, is a town known for its \"suman\" and cashew products. Laguna is known for \"buko pie\" (coconut pie) and \"panutsa\" (peanut brittle). Batangas is home to Taal Lake, a body of water that surrounds Taal Volcano. The lake is home to 75 species of freshwater fish, including landlocked marine species that have since adapted to the Taal lake environment. Eight of these species are of high commercial value. These include a population of giant trevally locally known as \"maliputo\" which is distinguished from their marine counterparts which are known as \"talakitok\". Another commercially important species is the \"tawilis\", the only known freshwater sardine and endemic to the lake. Batangas is also known for its special coffee, \"kapeng barako\".\nBicol is noted for its gastronomic appetite for the fiery or chili-hot dishes. Perhaps the most well-known Bicolano dish is the very spicy Bicol Express. The region is also the well-known home of \"natong\" also known as \"laing\" or \"pinangat\" (pork or fish stew in taro leaves).\n\nIn Visayas, another souring agent in dishes in the form of \"batuan\" (\"Garcinia binucao\") is used. It is a fruit that is greenish, yellowish, somewhat rounded, and four centimeters or more in diameter. They have a firm outer covering and contain a very acid pulp and several seeds.\n\nTultul, a type of rock salt, is another ingredient made only in Guimaras, where it is sprinkled on cooked rice to serve as a side dish. The salt is an assortment of reeds, twigs and small pieces of bamboo carried to the shore by the sea tide where they have been soaked in seawater for some time and is then burned in large quantities while continually being doused with salt water on a daily basis. The ashes then is strained continuously by kaings and are then cooked in pans.\n\nBacolod City is the capital of Negros Occidental. There are a plethora of restaurants in Bacolod that serve delicious local dishes which are popular with visitors. It is known for \"inasal\" which literally translates to “cooked over fire”. The \"chicken \"inasal\"\" is a local version of chicken barbecue. It is cooked with red achuete or annatto seeds giving it a reddish color, and brushed with oil and cooked over the fire. The city is also famous for various delicacies such as \"piaya\", \"napoleones\" and \"pinasugbo\" (deep-fried and caramelled banana sprinkled with sesame seeds).\n\nLeyte is home to the famous \"Binagol\", Carabao Milk \"Pastillas\", \"Suman Latik\" and Moron (food). Taclobanon cuisine is made unique by the wide use of \"kinagod\" (grated coconut) and \"hatok\" (coconut milk). It is common to find \"hinatokan\" (dishes integrated in coconut milk) dishes in the city. \"Humba\" is said to have originated from the province since the taste in the region's cuisine distinctly has a slightly sweeter taste than the rest of the country. Because Leyte borders the sea, it is common to find multiple seafood dishes in the province. \"Masag\" (crab), \"tilang\" (scallops) and \"pasayan\" (shrimp) are common sea food in the region. Waray taste varies, allowing each family/\"angkan\" (clan) to create unique recipes. Other native delicacies from the province are \"Roskas\" (hard cookies made from lard, anise, flour, sugar, butter and eggs) and Bukayo (coconut strip candies). \n\nAklan is synonymous with \"inubarang manok\", chicken cooked with \"ubad\" (banana pith), as well as \"binakol na manok\", chicken cooked in coconut water with lemongrass. Of particular interest is \"tamilok\" (woodworms), which is either eaten raw or dipped in an acidic sauce such as vinegar or calamansi. There is a special prevalence of chicken and coconut milk (\"gata\") in Akeanon cooking.\nIloilo is home of the \"batchoy\", derived from “ba-chui” meaning pieces of meat in Hokkien Chinese. The authentic \"batchoy\" contains fresh egg noodles called \"miki\", \"buto-buto\" broth slow-cooked for hours, and beef, pork and \"bulalo\" mixed with the local \"guinamos\" (shrimp paste). Toppings include generous amounts of fried garlic, crushed chicharon, scallions, slices of pork intestines and liver. Another type of pancit which is found in the said province is \"pancit Molo\", an adaptation of wonton soup and is a specialty of the town of Molo, a well-known district in Iloilo. Unlike other pancit, \"pancit Molo\" is not dry but soupy and it does not make use of long, thin noodles but instead wonton wrappers made from rice flour. Iloilo is also famous for its two \"kadios\" or pigeon pea-based soups. The first is KBL or \"kadios baboy langka\". As the name implies, the three main ingredients of this dish are \"kadyos\", \"baboy\" (pork), and \"langka\" (unripe jackfruit is used here). Another one is KMU or \"kadios manok ubad\". This dish is composed mainly of \"kadyos\", \"manok\" (preferably free range chicken called \"Bisaya nga manok\" in Iloilo), and \"ubad\" (thinly cut white core of the banana stalk/trunk). Both of these dishes utilize another Ilonggo ingredient as a souring agent. This ingredient is \"batwan\", or \"Garcinia binucao\", a fruit closely related to mangosteen, which is very popular in Western Visayas and neighbouring Negros Island, but is generally unknown to other parts of the Philippines.\n\nRoxas City is another food destination in Western Visayas aside from Iloilo City and Kalibo. This coastal city, about two to three hours by bus from Iloilo City, prides itself as the \"Seafood Capital of the Philippines\" due to its bountiful rivers, estuaries and seas. Numerous seafood dishes are served in the city's Baybay area such as mussels, oysters, scallops, prawns, seaweeds, clams, fishes and many more.\n\nCebu is known for its lechón variant. Lechon prepared \"Cebu style\" is characterized by a crisp outer skin and a moist juicy meat with a unique taste given by a blend of spices. Cebu is also known for sweets like dried mangoes and caramel tarts.\n\nIn Bohol, \"kalamay\" is popular. In Palawan, crocodile meat is boiled, cured, and turned into \"tocinos\". In Romblon, a specialty dish is pounded and flavored shrimp meat and rice cooked inside banana leaves.\n\nIn Mindanao, the southern part of Palawan island, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, dishes are richly flavored with the spices common to Southeast Asia: turmeric, coriander, lemon grass, cumin, and chillies — ingredients not commonly used in the rest of Philippine cooking. The cuisine of the indigenous ethnolinguistic nations who are either Christian, Muslim or Lumad peoples of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago has much in common with the rich and spicy Malay cuisine of Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Indonesian and Thai cuisine, and from other countries cuisines.\n\nWell-known dishes from the region include \"Satti\" (satay) and \"ginataang manok\" (chicken cooked in spiced coconut milk). Certain parts of Mindanao are predominantly Muslim, where pork is rarely consumed.\n\n\"Rendang\", is an often spicy beef curry whose origins derive from the Minangkabau people of Sumatra; \"biryani\" and \"kiyoning\" (pilaf) are dishes originally from the Middle East, that were given a Mindanaoan touch and served on special occasions.\n\n\"Piyanggang manok\" is a Tausug dish made from barbecued chicken marinated in spices, and served with coconut milk infused with toasted coconut meat.\n\n\"Chupá Culo\" & \"Curacha con Gatâ\" are examples of a Zamboangueño dishes made from shells cooked with coconut milk and crab with sauce blended in coconut milk with spices, respectively. There are other known Zamboangueño dishes and delicacy like \"Estofado\", \"Sicalañg\", \"Alfajor\", \"Endulzao\", \"Tamal\", \"Paella\", \"Arroz a la Valenciana\", \"Rebosao\", \"Toron\", and more.\n\nPopular crops such as cassava root, sweet potatoes, and yams are grown.\n\n\"Sambal\", a spicy sauce made with belacan, tamarind, aromatic spices and chilies, is a popular base of many dishes in the region.\n\n\"Palapa\", is a popular condiment unique to, and widely used in, Maranao and Maguindanaon cuisines, and consists of a base of shredded old coconut, sakurab (a variant of green onion), ginger, chillies, salt, pepper, and turmeric.\n\nAnother popular dish from this region is \"tiyula itum\", a dark broth of beef or chicken lightly flavored with ginger, chili, turmeric, and toasted coconut flesh (which gives it its dark color).\n\n\"Lamaw\" (Buko salad), is a mixture of young coconut, its juice, milk or orange juice, with ice.\n\nAside from pastries and desserts, there are heartier snacks for \"merienda\" that can also serve as either an appetizer or side dish for a meal. \"Siomai\" is the local version\" of Chinese shaomai.\"\n\"Lumpia\" are spring rolls that can be either fresh or fried. Fresh \"lumpia\" (\"lumpiang sariwa\") is usually made for fiestas or special occasions as it can be labor-intensive to prepare, while one version of fried \"lumpia\" (\"lumpiang prito\"), \"lumpiang shanghai\" is usually filled with ground pork and a combination of vegetables, and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. Other variations are filled with minced pork and shrimp and accompanied by a vinegar-based dipping sauce. \"Lumpia\" has been commercialized in frozen food form. Also, one of the common street food would be the Beef Pares in Manila. While Middle-Eastern food such as the Shawarma became popular in the Philippines in the late 1980s.\n\nThere's a distinct range of street foods available in the Philippines. Some of these are skewered on sticks in the manner of a kebab. One such example is \"banana-cue\" which is a whole banana or plantain skewered on a short thin bamboo stick, rolled in brown sugar, and pan-fried. \"Kamote-cue\" is a peeled sweet potato skewered on a stick, covered in brown sugar and then pan-fried. Fish balls or squid balls including Calamares are also pan-fried, then skewered on bamboo sticks and given to the customer, who then has a choice of dipping in a sweet or savory sauce. These are commonly sold frozen in markets and peddled by street vendors.\n\n\"Turon\", a kind of \"lumpia\" consisting of an eggroll or phyllo wrapper commonly filled with sliced plantain and occasionally jackfruit, is fried and sprinkled with sugar.\n\"Taho\" is a warm treat made of soft beancurd which is the \"taho\" itself, dark caramel syrup called \"arnibal\", and tapioca pearls. It is often sold in neighborhoods by street vendors who yell out \"\"taho\"\" in a manner like that of vendors in the stands at sporting events yelling out \"hotdogs\" or \"peanuts\". Sometimes, \"taho\" is served chilled, and flavors have recently been added, such as chocolate or strawberry. \"Taho\" is derived from the original Chinese snack food known as \"douhua\".\n\nThere is also \"iskrambol\" (from the English \"to scramble\"), a kind of iced-based treat similar to a sorbet. The shaved ice is combined with various flavorings and usually topped with chocolate syrup. It is eaten by \"scrambling\" the contents or mixing them, then drinking with a large straw. It was later modified into \"ice scramble\", or simply \"scramble\", but with added skim milk, chocolate or strawberry syrup, and a choice of toppings such as marshmallows, chocolate or candy sprinkles, rice crispies, or tapioca pearls.\nStreet food featuring eggs include \"kwek-kwek\" which are hard-boiled quail eggs dipped in orange-dyed batter and then deep fried similar to tempura. \"Tokneneng\" is a larger version of \"kwek-kwek\" using chicken or duck eggs. Another Filipino egg snack is \"balut\", essentially a boiled pre-hatched poultry egg, usually duck or chicken. These fertilized eggs are allowed to develop until the embryo reaches a pre-determined size and are then boiled. There is also another egg item called \"penoy,\" which is basically hard-boiled unfertilized duck eggs that does not contain embryo.

The Evaporating Cloud (EC) - also referred to in the literature as \"the cloud\", or as a \"conflict resolution diagram\" - is a logical diagram representing a problem that has no obvious satisfactory solution.\n\nThe most commonly used of the TOC tools, the EC was designed to address conflict or dilemma situations (trade-off situations where there is no acceptable compromise) by diagramming the logic behind the conflict and methodically examining the assumptions behind the logic.\nThe EC has a set format with five boxes, labelled A, B, C, D, D’, that are usually laid out as follows:\n\nThe boxes represent two opposing \"wants\" that represent the conflict (D, D’), the \"needs\" that each want is trying to satisfy (B, C), and a common \"objective\" or goal (A) that both needs are trying to fulfil.\n\nThe lines or arrows connecting the nodes represent the rationale or causal assumptions that are used to link the nodes. When communicating the cloud, the arrows should be read as \"in order to\" or \"because\" or \"so that\". For example: \"\"In order to achieve A we require B because there is no way we can have A without B.\"\" Or: \"\"There is no way we can have D and have D’ \"(read as \"D-prime\")\" at the same time.\"\"\n\nAccording to Scheinkopf (2002) the Evaporating Cloud is so named in honor of Richard Bach. In Bach's 1977 book \"Illusions\", the main characters remove storm clouds from the sky by thinking them away.\nThe Evaporating Cloud tool is intended to similarly \"vapourize\" difficult problems by resolving an underlying conflict.\n\nThe general process for applying an EC to problem solving is described by Cohen (2010) as follows:\n\nClouds are \"built\" by filling in the appropriate boxes with statements about the situation. Both the wording of the statements and the sequence of filling the boxes can be important. Below is a guide to the recommended sequence and questions for building \"Day-to-day Conflict\" or \"Inner Dilemma\" clouds.\nDifferent types of problems have slightly different requirements when it comes to documenting and communicating the underlying conflict. Below is a summary of different types of problems, and the suggested sequence for building and communicating the cloud.\nGoldratt has illustrated the use of the evaporating cloud technique in a discussion of the Economic production quantity model. The prerequisite wants are to \"run large batches\" (D) and yet to \"run small batches\" (D’). These are clearly in conflict. The required need that D is trying to meet is to \"reduce setup cost\" (B), whereas the D’ prerequisite needs to \"reduce carrying cost per unit\" (C). Both requirements are aimed at the objective (A): to \"reduce cost per unit\".\nFedurko (2011) recommends checking the logic of the EC by reading the logical statements aloud, in the following sequence:\n\nAccording to Fedurko,\n\nGoldratt claims that each of the logical connections in the EC represent an (often hidden) assumption.\n\nThe assumptions behind the above connections can be surfaced by again reading the statements with a \"because\" clause added. For example, Goldratt surfaces the following assumptions behind the 2nd statement in the example EC:\nAnd again, with the 5th statement:\n\nThe second assumption is challenged by distinguishing between \"production batch\" size (between setups) and \"transfer batch\" size (between workstations), and so allowing different sized batches for different purposes.\n\nThe Core Conflict Cloud is an Evaporating Cloud that emerges from analysis of a current reality tree (CRT), which is one of the Thinking Processes. The CRT provides a way for analyzing many system or organizational problems at once, treating them as symptoms of a single core problem.\nIf an easy solution to such a core problem has not already been implemented, it is likely there is some conflict in the organization that is blocking implementation. The role of the Core Conflict Cloud is to address this inherent conflict that is preventing the sorting out of the core problem.\n\n\n"}

Scholars suppose that it could have resulted from the gradual combination of the pilum and two German spears, the angon and the bebra. As more and more Germans joined the Roman army, their culture and traditions became a driving force for change. The spiculum was better than the old pilum when used as a thrusting spear, but still maintained some of the former weapon's penetrative power when thrown.\n\nVegetius mentions the spiculum in his military manual, but some scholars maintain that the spiculum was simply a different name for the pilum. Whatever the case, most historians accept that the spiculum evolved from the earlier javelins used by the Roman army.\n\nThe main difference between the spiculum and the pilum was the length of the thin point. The spiculum tended to have a much shorter iron point. Thus, the spiculum was significantly shorter than its ancestor, perhaps 190 cm long. The spiculum had a medium iron shank attached to the head. Its exact design is not fully known as there were many variants. The spiculum fell out of favour with the Roman army some time after 400 AD.\n\n"}

Together with Leonhard Ragaz, he was one of the founders of Christian socialism in Switzerland. He was heavily influenced by Christoph Blumhardt. He combined Blumhardt's expectation of a coming Kingdom of God with a belief in socialist progress. He saw social democracy as a \"tool\" of the living God, and its followers as unwitting servants of God. He authored 11 books.\n\nKutter was born at Bern on 12 September 1863, the son of Wilhelm Rudolf Kutter (1818–1888), an engineer, and Marie Albertina König (1833–1923). He married Lydia Rohner (1868–1936) in 1892. He grew up in a pietistic home and studied theology in Basel, Bern, and Berlin. In 1894 he became a pastor in Vinelz (Bielersee), 1898 in Zürich (Neumünster). He died on 31 March 1931 in St. Gallen.\n\nUnder the impression of a combination of the Christian expectation of the Kingdom of God, the life philosophies of the time, and the socialistic faith in the future of the younger Blumhardt, as well as the philosophy of German idealism, Kutter reached a dynamic view of God: God, who through Christ penetrates humankind and the world in eternal reality is the only reality of life. With this theocentric theology Kutter paved the way for so-called \"dialectical theology\" (Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, Eduard Thurneysen). For Kutter, the return to \"direct life\" is completed in the history of humankind; socialism is a sign of this. But for Kutter this return to the direct is at the same time the meaning and goal of Christendom. For him, social democrats are instruments of the living God; \"they must\" proclaim to the world the judgment and the great turning point in their service to God, without realizing it themselves. Nonetheless, Kutter never joined the Social Democratic Party (as Leonhard Ragaz and Karl Barth did); neither did he identify the gospel with socialism.\n\nHe was a pacifist.\n'They Must' by Hermann Kutter (1908) Online\n"}

He was influenced by Christoph Blumhardt. He was married to the feminist and peace activist Clara Ragaz-Nadig.\n\nBorn to a farmer family in Tamins, Grisons, on 28 July 1868, Ragaz studied theology in Basel, Jena, and Berlin. In 1890, he was elected as minister in Flerden, Heinzenberg. In 1893, he moved to Chur, working as a teacher of language and religion, and from 1895 to 1902 as municipal minister. In 1902, Ragaz was elected as minister at the Basel Minster.\n\nIn Basel, Ragaz came into contact with the labour movement. As construction workers went on strike in 1903, Ragaz delivered a sermon in the minster which came to be known as the \"bricklayers' strike sermon\" (), in which he said that \"if institutional Christendom were to be cold and incomprehending towards the becoming of a new world, which after all emerged from the heart of the gospel, then the salt of the earth would have become putrid\".\n\nIn 1908, Ragaz was called to a professorship at the theological faculty of the University of Zurich.\nDuring the of 1918, he took sides with the workers, and as the authorities sent troops to protect the university buildings from the strikers, he protested.\nIn 1921, he resigned as professor, stating that he could not continue to educate ministers for the \"bourgeois\" Swiss Reformed Church.\nHe and his family moved to the proletarian Aussersihl district of Zurich.

{"id": "2047252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047252", "title": "AOL Community Leader Program", "text": "AOL Community Leader Program\n\nThe AOL Community Leader Program or AOL CLP was the official name for the large group of America Online online service volunteers who moderated chat rooms, message boards, and download libraries.\n\nThe program's roots dated back to the use of online remote volunteer \"guides\" by AOL predecessor QuantumLink at its start in 1985. The system which became AOL established the Community Leader Program officially in the early 1990s, and discontinued it in 2005. At the peak of the program, it is estimated that AOL had approximately 14,000 volunteers, including 350 non-adult teenagers.\n\nCommunity Leaders had a wide variety of responsibilities, ranging from hosting chat rooms, monitoring message boards and file libraries, providing customer service, teaching online classes, and particularly creating and managing forum content. However, toward the end of the program, Community Leader duties were generally restricted to monitoring chat and message boards. In exchange for their services, AOL provided free service to their volunteers. Community Leaders also received special accounts (Price Index 77 or Overhead Accounts) that allowed them to restrict disruptive chat, hide inappropriate message board postings, and access private areas on the AOL service, such as the Community Leader Headquarters (CLHQ).\n\nAlthough at times controversial, the Community Leader program arguably played a substantial role in the rapid growth and success of the America Online service in the mid-1990s. Because they were usually recruited from the more active users of a particular online forum, Community Leaders were often very passionate about the area for which they volunteered their time. This enthusiasm usually resulted in a greater sense of community and a higher level of professionalism in that forum. This in turn gave the AOL service more value over the less organized \"frontier\" of the Internet, at least in the eyes of users new to the online scene at the time. It also provided oversight with respect to forum content by knowledgeable individuals.\n\nIn May 1999, Kelly Hallisey and Brian Williams, two former Community Leaders, filed a class action lawsuit against AOL, claiming that AOL volunteers performed work equivalent to employees and thus should be compensated according to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The plaintiffs argued that the Community Leader position required a significant amount of effort and detail to qualify the position as having an \"employee relationship\" with AOL. The plaintiffs specifically demonstrated how Community Leaders had to undergo a thorough, 3-month training program and were required to file timecards for shifts, work at least four hours per week, and submit detailed reports outlining their work activity during each shift. When AOL first started the program it charged for access to its services by the hour, thus Community Leaders, i.e. those who were heavy Internet users saved hundreds of dollars each month. This fact actually hurt AOL when the lawsuit began, however, as the reception of benefits (along with whether the work is full-time and displaces regular employees) is a factor that helps the Department of Labor determine if a volunteer should actually be paid. The U.S. Department of Labor investigated the report, but came to no conclusions, officially closing the investigation in 2001. In response to the investigation, AOL began drastically reducing volunteer responsibilities. By 2000, nearly all Community Leaders had lost content-editing rights and no longer provided customer service or technical support to AOL customers. Additionally, in many AOL forums, Community Leader supervisors became more lax about paperwork and shift hours.\n\nIn February 2008, the court in which the lawsuit was filed denied AOL's Motion to Dismiss and certified the case for class-action status. The court has ordered AOL to provide the names and contact information for all former Community Leaders to notify them and give them the opportunity to join the class-action lawsuit.\n\nIn February 2010, the United States for the Southern District of New York gave preliminary approval to a settlement between AOL and the Community Leaders totaling 15 million dollars. Final approval was granted in May 2010.\n\nThe Department of Labor investigation, which, at least in part prompted AOL to limit Community Leader responsibilities, caused issues for the company. Without unpaid volunteers, the company would have to hire employees to manage and post online content and run effective online communities previously done by Community Leaders. Leading up to and following the AOL Time Warner merger, AOL did not have the time or money to invest in building and maintaining its online community. The company's later focus on advertising as its major source of income rather than high quality bespoke online content, an intention that began earlier in 1996 when subscriber hourly rates were replaced with a single unlimited-use monthly fee, provided the company little apparent profit incentive to monetize community forums.\n\nAlong with the DOL investigation, and with less need for well-managed communities and membership in serious decline, AOL decided to terminate its volunteer program. In late May 2005, AOL informed its Community Leaders that they would be released from their positions on June 8 of that year. AOL offered volunteers 12 months of free service in compensation for their services. While many Community Leaders left the service after this announcement, others stayed with AOL and continued their efforts at building community, albeit in an unofficial role.\n\n"}

Consequently, his nickname became Siener (Afrikaans for \"seer\"). Van Rensburg's visions were typically wrapped in a patriotic, religious format, and have been interpreted by believers as predictions of future events. During the Boer War he became a trusted companion, if not advisor to General de la Rey and President Steyn. The extent of his influence with these figures is disputed, though the devoutly religious de la Rey seemed to have considered him a prophet of God.\n\nVan Rensburg was born on the farm Palmietfontein in the Potchefstroom district, the son of Willem Jacobus Janse van Rensburg and Anna Catharina Janse van Rensburg. He only received 20 days of formal school training at the Rooipoort farm school, and spent much of his youth as a cattle herder. He could never write, but assisted by his mother, he learnt to read from the Bible. He never read anything else.\n\nAt age 16, he participated in a government expedition against the rebellious tribal leader Mabhogo. He contracted and survived malaria on the expedition and afterwards settled near Wolmaranstad in the then western ZAR. At age 21 he was an elected elder for the Hervormde Kerk, perhaps due to his scriptural knowledge. He married Anna Sophia Kruger in 1884.\n\nVan Rensburg and his brother Pieter were commandeered to participate in the second Anglo-Boer War under General Sarel P. du Toit. Van Rensburg however remained unarmed and never fired a shot. His contribution was to be a stream of visions and prophesies for the duration of the war. As the seer would later explain, he believed that a nightly visitor woke him only a day before the outbreak of the war, with a message that his work was dedicated to God.\n\nFollowing this vision, van Rensburg was beset with a fear that would not dissipate. When this disturbed state continued into their sojourn in Kimberley, his superiors sent him home. Experiencing no relief, he returned to the Siege of Kimberley, where he believed a new vision had revealed to him the defeat and loss of life that the war would bring about. Shortly afterwards, possibly at Graspan, his disturbed state lifted permanently as a soldier was wounded on his side, as, according to van Rensburg, another vision had forewarned. Van Rensburg then travelled with general Piet Cronjé but escaped the encirclement by British forces at Paardeberg. Subsequently, he travelled with different commandos, where a number of apparently accurate predictions established his reputation.\n\nA report of his visions attracted the attention of General de la Rey, who recruited Van Rensburg for his commando. On 7 December 1900, General de Wet found himself cornered against the Caledon River, which was in flood, while British forces were assailing his position. When his surrender appeared imminent, a message from De la Rey was delivered by a Boer scout. Van Rensburg had allegedly foreseen the situation and the message outlined an escape route, which was duly followed, leaving the pursuers to flounder in the torrent which De Wet had just traversed. De la Rey, also hard pressed by his enemy, dispatched Van Rensburg to accompany President Steyn to Roodewal, De Wet's safe retreat in the northern Free State. Here Van Rensburg advised them to wait upon two horsemen which he described, who arrived the next day with a message from acting President Schalk Burger.\n\nOn 13 September 1901, van Rensburg found himself in the camp of Commandant Roux at Rietkuil near Vredefort. Sensing imminent danger, he advised those present, who had just retired for the day, to depart from the camp at once. Roux was slow to take heed, and his men even more so, as scouts had not observed enemy units. Van Rensburg, his wife and children escaped on a cart, shortly before the greater part of the camp was captured in a surprise attack.\n\nIn January 1901 Van Rensburg had a vision indicating the flight of three Boer women, who were soon found and rescued by his host Willem Bosman. Days after rejoining De la Rey's commando he had visions of members of his own family being captured, and asked for leave to assist them. The Van Rensburg family fled from their farmhouse as British forces approached, but the wagon train carrying the elderly, women and neighbours was surprised and captured by traitors the following morning. Van Rensburg's parents, eldest daughter Hester and four younger children were subsequently interned at the Mafeking concentration camp.\n\nVan Rensburg, his wife, eldest son Willem and two daughters travelled with a group which managed to evade their pursuers, and Van Rensburg once again joined De la Rey's commando. Upon meeting his wife again in mid October 1901, they found their farmhouse destroyed. Van Rensburg's ominous premonition concerning their daughters, Anna and Maria, was confirmed when news arrived that they and two relatives had died during an outbreak of measles in the concentration camp.\n\nVan Rensburg was present when Commandant Van Aardt's company returned from the action at Yzerspruit on 25 February 1902. Van Aardt was in a despondent state as his brother was missing in action. Van Rensburg however assured him that his brother was neither dead nor captured, but alive, though in great pain. The wounded soldier was returned to camp the same evening, carried on the horse of a burgher who found him.\n\nBefore the Battle of Tweebosch, Van Rensburg gave a number of predictions indicating how the enemy would approach along the Harts River, and when he deemed them most vulnerable. He also envisaged how the victory would enhance De la Rey's reputation. Methuen's force collapsed in the face of De la Rey's sudden attack on 7 March 1902, and Methuen was captured.\n\nOn 17 March 1902, President Steyn, in the company of De Wet and Hertzog, arrived at Zendelingsfontein, De la Rey's headquarters near Klerksdorp, to consult De la Rey's physician about an eye ailment. Van Rensburg was once again dispatched to guard the president. Around the 23rd he had a vision of English troops arriving, but the president was unwilling to heed his warning, until De la Rey intervened urgently on Van Rensburg's behalf. The president departed for the safety of the Molopo River on the evening of the 24th. British troops arrived at Zendelingsfontein during the early hours of the 25th and captured two of De la Rey's adjutants.\n\nGaining entry to General Kemp's war council in the bushveld region, he soon warned them against attacking a retreating enemy, which would leave them vulnerable to encirclement. At the subsequent Battle of Harts River on 31 March 1902, some British units did fall back, though some Canadians stood their ground until overpowered by burgher forces. Kemp, though partially or grudgingly heeding the seer's visions, was generally reluctant to give him credit.\n\nWhen the Union of South Africa came out in support of the Allied Powers in World War I, Van Rensburg allied with the rebels. The rebellion received a fatal blow even before it started, when the influential general Koos de la Rey was accidentally killed on 15 September 1914.\n\nDe la Rey, when killed, was en route to General J.G.C. Kemp, who subsequently organised the rebellion in western Transvaal. On 2 November, Kemp addressed a public meeting at Vleeskraal, near Schweizer-Reneke, with the locally influential Van Rensburg at his side. Van Rensburg also addressed the assembly, and assured them that his visions indicated they had little to fear. 610 men then joined the rebel cause, and with conscription imminent, the number of rebel volunteers grew to 1,800.\n\nGeneral Kemp decided on a company of 720 men, mostly farmers, which included Van Rensburg and his son. They departed immediately on a journey to join Manie Maritz in German South-West Africa. After a desert trek and much hardship they linked up with Maritz's company on 29 November. Rebels under De Wet and Beyers were rounded up by South African forces in the days that followed.\n\nReturning to South Africa, Maritz and Kemp engaged government forces at Nous, Lutzputs and finally at Upington, on 3 February 1915. Van Rensburg's son Willem was mortally wounded in the Upington clash, and the whole rebel force captured, with the exception of Maritz who fled via German South-West Africa, to Angola and from thence to Portugal. Van Rensburg, like his comrades, received a prison sentence. He however served about a year, first in Boksburg, then in the Old Fort, Johannesburg.\n\nAfter his release Nicolaas van Rensburg returned to his farm Rietkuil, near Wolmaranstad. Some of his visions were then recorded by reverend Dr Rossouw. Van Rensburg's daughter Anna Badenhorst also recorded a set of visions up to his death at age 61. The latter set is considered to be difficult to interpret and not very coherent.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the collections of visions were considered inflammatory. Distribution was prohibited and some copies seized on orders of prime minister Jan Smuts. Upon Anna's death her handwritten documents were transferred to Lichtenburg museum's archives, where they were rediscovered in 1991. The farm and van Rensburg family cemetery are located 11 km from Ottosdal, in the North West Province.\n\nHis mother commented on his visual hallucinations as a toddler, and said that these seemed to disturb him. General Hertzog described him as someone continuously distracted by a maze of imagery and symbolism. 700 visions have been documented.\n\nVan Rensburg interpreted his hallucinations as visions that were usually connected to the welfare of the Boere, the Netherlands and Germany. For example, a vision of the sisal plant was interpreted as a portent of an important meeting, assembly or parliament. Van Rensburg's visions have been described by some as predictions of local events, such as the death of general Koos de la Rey and the political transition of South Africa. Van Rensburg and his followers have also interpreted his visions as being connected to international events, such as the start of World War I and the rise of Communism. He did not interpret all of his visions, and some have been posthumously applied to more recent events as prophecies.\n\nBoer soldier Deneys Reitz's account of the Boer War contains a colourful objective account of one of the seer's predictions (shortened):\n\n... a prophet, a strange character, with long flowing beard and wild fanatical eyes, who dreamed dreams and pretended to possess occult powers. I personally witnessed one of the lucky hits while we were congregated around the General's cart. Van Rensburg was expounding his latest vision to a hushed audience. It ran of a black bull and a red bull fighting, until at length the red bull sank defeated to its knees, referring to the British. Arms outstretched and eyes ablaze, he suddenly called out: \"See, who comes?\"; and, looking up, we made out a distant horseman spurring towards us. When he came up, he produced a letter from General Botha, hundreds of miles away.\n\nGeneral de la Rey opened it and said: \"Men, believe me, the proud enemy is humbled\". The letter contained news that the English had proposed a peace conference. \"Coming immediately upon the prophecy, it was a dramatic moment and I was impressed, even though I suspected that van Rensburg had stage-managed the scene. Of the general's sincerity there could be no doubt as he firmly believed in the seer's predictions.\"\n\nThe Suidlanders, an ethnonationalist (völkisch) Afrikaner survivalist group, Suidlanders are heavily influenced by the prophecies of van Rensburg.\n\n"}
{"id": "2047259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047259", "title": "Mission president", "text": "Mission president\n\nMission president is a priesthood leadership position in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A mission president presides over a geographic area known as a mission and the missionaries serving in the mission. Depending on the particular mission, a mission president may also be the presiding priesthood leader of some or all Latter-day Saints within the geographic boundaries of the mission. Mission presidents are ordained high priests of the church.\n\nMission presidents are assigned to a mission by the leadership of the LDS Church and typically discover the location a few months before their departure. Mission presidents are men typically between 40 and 65 years old. In the past some mission presidents have been much younger; LeGrand Richards and Stephen R. Covey both served as mission presidents while in their 20s and Thomas S. Monson became a mission president at age 31. In more recent years younger mission presidents have been more rare. In 2005, there were 130 new mission presidents, the youngest of them, Norbert Ounleu, was 35. The only mission president called under the age of 30 since 2005 was Kerving H. Joseph, who was 29 when he became president of the Haiti Port-au-Prince Mission in 2009.\n\nMission presidents are generally assigned to areas other than where they reside at the time of their call. There are exceptions, such as Richard G. Hinckley, who presided over the Utah Salt Lake City Mission. In 2009, at least two of the newly called mission presidents resided within the boundaries of the missions over which they served: Kerving H. Joseph (who was then still the president of the Haiti Port-au-Prince mission at the time of the 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake) and Claude R. Gamiette, a native and resident of Guadaloupe, who was appointed president of West Indies Mission, which covered Guadaloupe. Tonga has also had a few men native to the country who were residing in the islands when called to serve as presidents of the Tongan mission. Effian Kadarusman, an Indonesian, served as president of the Indonesia Jakarta Mission for four years in the 1980s. With over 400 missions, there are few which have a president who was a resident in the mission boundaries at the time of his call at any given time. An example of an exception occurred in approximately 2005, when the church decided to have Venezuelan natives serve as presidents of all the local missions due to growing discord between the United States and Venezuela, but often the presidents were from areas of Venezuela other than where they were called to.\n\nAccording to current policy, a mission president must be married. Typically, his wife and any dependent children accompany him on his mission. During the first 100 years of the church, there were some single mission presidents and several others who left their wives and children elsewhere while they served. On the other hand, when Wilford Woodruff presided over the Eastern States Mission in the 1840s his wife, Phoebe, was set apart to serve with him. Brigham Young, Jr., not only had his wife, Catherine Curtis Spencer Young, serving with him while he presided over the British Mission in the 1860s but one of their children was born while they were there. When Heber J. Grant brought his wife and six daughters with him when he came to preside over the British Mission in 1903, Francis M. Lyman looked unfavorably upon this new innovation.\n\nMission presidents are either retired or leave their vocations for three years to preside over their mission. They live in properties owned or leased by the LDS Church, which also covers basic living and household expenses for mission presidents. Prominent examples include former United States Congressman Wayne Owens, former Governor of Utah Norm Bangerter, two-time Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award recipient Dale Murphy, and Harvard Business School professor Steven C. Wheelwright. They usually receive training in late June and begin the service about the first of July, unless there are emergencies or medical conditions that require otherwise.\n\nCandidates are typically interviewed in the last few months of each year, initially by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. If candidates are chosen, the First Presidency extends the call to serve. The official announcements of new mission presidents is typically done through the first few months of the subsequent year via the weekly \"Church News\".\n\nUnlike most positions in the church, when they are initially called, mission presidents are not subject to the common consent acceptance of any body of members. Once serving, they are subject to frequent votes of common consent in branches and districts over which the mission president presides.\n\nMission presidents generally supervise a group that ranges between 60 and 200 missionaries and direct their missionary labors. Missionaries are typically between the ages of 18–25, but can also include senior-aged couples and older single women.\n\nMission presidents are usually assisted by two counselors, who reside within the mission boundaries, in overseeing areas of the mission boundaries that are not organized into stakes; the three men together constitute the \"mission presidency\" and are each given the honorific title \"President\". The counselors serve in the mission presidency for varying periods of time while maintaining their regular employment. The responsibilities of the counselors are generally oriented towards the members of the church within the mission, often organized into districts and branches.\n\nAdditionally, mission presidents are assisted by two or more full-time missionaries under the title of \"assistant to the president\", whose duties are primarily directed toward supervision of the missionary work, under the direction of the mission president. These assistants lead an independent hierarchy that may or may not correspond with local church units. The role of a mission president's wife varies depending on the age of her children and her background.\n\nMission presidents are assigned to train and watch over the missionaries who serve under their direction. Mission presidents are typically respected and admired by the missionaries they supervise. Obedience to the mission president is considered a vital part of missionary work.\n\nIn areas within mission boundaries where there are no stakes, the mission president is the presiding church authority. In those circumstances, the mission is divided into districts which are composed of branches. In that role, he serves in a capacity similar to that of a stake president.\n\nWhile missionaries have responsibility for the spiritual progress of those investigating the church in their individual area, the mission president is responsible for all those investigating the church within the mission boundaries, and in special cases interviews those desiring to be baptized.\n\nAfter his three-year term ends, a mission president generally returns to his vocation and activity in his home ward and stake. Many general authorities of the church have previously served as mission presidents, but it is not necessary for a person to have been a mission president to become a general authority.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2047264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047264", "title": "Zuko", "text": "Zuko\n\nZuko is the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation and an incredibly powerful Firebender, meaning he has the elemental ability to create and control fire and to redirect lightning through martial arts techniques. He is the eldest child of Fire Lord Ozai and Princess Ursa, the older brother of Princess Azula, and older half-brother of Kiyi. Before the events of the series, Zuko is exiled from the Fire Nation by his father and told he must capture the Avatar to restore his honor and right to the throne. Zuko is accompanied and advised in his search by his uncle, Iroh. Introduced in Book One, he is the primary antagonist to the Avatar. But over time, Zuko sympathizes with oppressed peoples, and joins the Avatar to restore peace, becoming one of the main protagonists. Zuko has two well known great-grandfathers: on his father's side, Fire Lord Sozin, who started the hundred-year-war and has a comet named after him, and on his mother's side Avatar Roku, the Avatar preceding Aang.\n\nIn \"The Deserter\", Zuko's name was listed on a Fire Nation wanted poster as \"祖寇\" (zǔ kòu). In \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\", his name was written as \"蘇科\" (sū kè) on his segment's title card.\n\nZuko lives in where a large fraction of the human population can manipulate any one of the four classical elements: water, earth, fire, or air. The art of controlling and manipulating an element is called \"bending\" within the narrative. A few years before the events of the series, Crown Prince Zuko voiced opposition to a general's suggestion that the Fire Nation soldiers be sacrificed in their nation's battle with the Earth Kingdom. Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko's father, ordered Zuko to submit to an Agni Kai, a ritual duel fought with firebending, to teach him respect. Zuko accepted the challenge believing that he would fight the general who proposed the plan, but instead he faced Ozai. When Zuko refused to fight his father, the Fire Lord scarred him over his left eye and sent him into exile. Zuko's uncle, the decorated general Iroh, decided to join him as a companion and tutor.\n\nZuko is a handsome teenager with pale skin, golden eyes and black hair. The majority of the left side of his face is taken up by a distinctive burn scar he received from a disastrous Agni Kai (a form of firebending duel used to settle matters of honor, and often fatal to the loser) against his father Ozai. In Book One, Zuko has a shaved head with a ponytail. In Book Two, he cuts off his ponytail in the season premiere and allows his hair to grow back. He obtains a topknot in Book Three, but is usually seen without it outside the royal palace. Zuko has a muscular physique in Book One, but becomes thinner as the series progresses before regaining weight in Book Three. In \"Legend of Korra\", the elderly Zuko now sports a lengthy beard and long white hair, much like his Avatar great-grandfather Roku. He is still quite fit and powerful despite being in his eighties (by the time of his first appearance in Book 3).\n\nThe Blue Spirit design was inspired from a Dragon King Nuo mask from Chinese drama. His mask was made blue, because the creators thought that a red mask would give away the Blue Spirit's secret identity to the audience too easily.\n\nDante Basco voices Zuko in \"The Last Airbender\" as a teenager while Elijah Runcorn voices him as a child. Dev Patel voices him in the video game adaptation of the movie. Bruce Davison voices Zuko in \"The Legend of Korra\" as Fire Lord of the Fire Nation, now in his 80s.\n\nDue to his banishment, Zuko is shown to be hot-tempered, impatient and (at times) also depressive. Despite this, he is also shown to be caring and thoughtful, though his judgement was heavily clouded by his jealousy towards his younger sister Azula and his desire to live up to his father's expectations. He has a close bond with his mother Ursa and his uncle Iroh. He strives to regain honor and attention in his father's eyes by trying to capture the Avatar in his name, but after returning to the Fire Nation from his years of banishment, he realized his father's ill feelings towards him couldn't be fixed, even by capturing the Avatar. After the battle with his father during the solar eclipse, Zuko leaves to join Aang and his friends on their mission to defeat the Fire Nation. Zuko decided that trying to regain honor, as a substitute for love, was worthless and a waste of time. He understood that he played an important role in helping the Avatar end the 100-Year War, and often displayed aggression towards Aang when training him in firebending because of the fact that it was imperative Aang learn it before Sozin's Comet arrived at the end of the summer. He is also shown to have a sarcastic side on several occasions. Due to his scar, he also has an inferiority complex about his appearance, stating angrily that: \"\"Normal\" teenagers worry about bad skin! I don't have that luxury! My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson — \"on my face\"!\"\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Zuko is introduced as the main antagonist who is searching for Aang in hopes of reclaiming his honor. Throughout the season he is hot on the Avatar's trail, at times both helped and hindered by Iroh. Zuko competes in his quest against Zhao, an ambitious Fire Nation admiral. In The Blue Spirit, Zuko rescues Aang from Zhao's fortress to prevent Zhao from accomplishing his goal. Zhao arranges an assassination plot against Zuko, but Zuko escapes with Iroh's help. During the invasion of the Northern Water Tribe, Zuko captures Aang, but both are nearly killed in a snowstorm. Aang then saves Zuko from dying of hypothermia. Zuko encounters Zhao and attacks in an act of revenge, but the Ocean Spirit abducts Zhao before the fight is concluded. Zuko attempts to save Zhao from the Ocean Spirit, but Zhao is too proud to accept Zuko's help. Ozai thereafter assigns Zuko's younger sister Azula to seize Zuko and Iroh due to Zuko's failure to capture Aang and Iroh's betrayal during the siege.\n\nPursued by Azula, sixteen-year-old Zuko and Iroh travel the Earth Kingdom as impoverished refugees. After briefly quarreling with and parting ways with Iroh, Zuko reunites with his uncle against Azula. When Azula wounds Iroh with a bolt of lightning, Zuko nurses Iroh back to health and Iroh teaches Zuko to redirect lightning. Zuko and Iroh arrive at the walled city of Ba Sing Se, meeting in the process. Iroh and Zuko find employment at a tea shop in the slums. Jet accuses Zuko and Iroh of being firebenders, but is arrested after he attacks Zuko. Zuko reluctantly adapts to his new life until he learns of Aang's presence in Ba Sing Se and attempts to steal Appa. However, Iroh convinces Zuko to abandon his quest and let Appa go. Azula infiltrates the city to stage a coup and arranges a trap for Zuko and Iroh. Captured and placed in Crystal Catacombs, Zuko encounters , and both are rescued by Aang. Although Zuko and Katara share a brief moment of compassion, Azula convinces Zuko to betray Iroh and the Avatar. In the resulting fight, Aang is wounded and Iroh is arrested.\n\nReturning to his country a hero, Zuko learns that Azula lied and told Fire Lord Ozai that Zuko killed the Avatar. Zuko suspects that Aang survived and hires an assassin to ensure Aang's death to cover up Azula's lie. Iroh is imprisoned, but manages to lead Zuko to learn that his maternal great-grandfather was Avatar Roku, Aang's previous incarnation. Prior to the Day of Black Sun, Zuko inadvertently catalyzes his father's plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom with Sozin's Comet. Zuko becomes guilty over betraying Iroh and contributing to a second genocide, leading him to confront Ozai during the eclipse. Zuko openly berates his father and states his intention to help Aang overthrow him. Although they initially reject him, Aang and his companions grow to accept Zuko as a member of the group after he proves his allegiance by helping defeat the assassin he had previously set on their track. Zuko also journeys with Aang to the Sun Temple to meet the last dragons, after he finds himself unable to firebend as well as he used to. His previous firebending was fueled primarily by anger, so it was therefore much weaker when he chose his new path. When Zuko and Aang are judged by the dragons, Zuko realizes how colorful fire really is, and finally understands the true beauty of firebending. Afterwards, he becomes an even more powerful firebender, and a better teacher to Aang.\n\nAfter helping Sokka free and Hakoda from the Boiling Rock prison, Zuko makes amends with Katara by locating her mother's killer. On finding out Aang intends to fight Ozai after Sozin's Comet has passed Zuko reveals his father's plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom. When Aang disappears shortly before Sozin's Comet, Zuko leads the effort to track down the Avatar, which leads him to Iroh. Zuko tearfully apologizes to Iroh, who forgives him for his mistakes. Iroh suggests that Zuko become the next Fire Lord, citing Zuko's \"unquestionable honor\". Arriving at the Fire Nation capital with Katara, Zuko duels Azula for the throne. When Azula faces defeat she forces Zuko to place himself in the path of a lightning bolt aimed at Katara, which leaves him wounded and immobile. Katara defeats Azula and heals Zuko. After Aang wins the war, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord, promising world order and harmony with the aid of the Avatar.\n\nFollowing Zuko's crown ceremony, seventeen year-old Zuko asks Aang to promise to kill him if he ever becomes like his father. Aang reluctantly agrees. One year later, Zuko is working with the other nations to return captured colonial lands to the Earth Kingdom as part of the Harmony Restoration Movement. Kori Morishita attempts to assassinate Zuko in retaliation for forcibly relocating the multicultural residents of the Fire Nation colonies. Zuko travels to Kori's hometown, Yu Dao, where he meets people of Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom ancestry living and working together. Zuko becomes conflicted and consults with the imprisoned Ozai, who advises Zuko that whatever decision he makes is inherently the correct choice because he exercises the power of the Fire Lord. Zuko decides to break from the Harmony Restoration Movement. The Earth King responds with a military force of his own and Zuko is forced to lead troops to Yu Dao to protect the Fire Nation civilians. In the battle, Aang and Zuko clash. However, Katara convinces the Earth King that the colonies are neither Fire Nation nor Earth Kingdom, but rather a multicultural people. Peace is restored, and Zuko realizes that forcing Aang to make the promise was a way of distancing himself from his responsibilities as Fire Lord. He releases Aang from the promise, and the two reestablish their friendship and trust.\n\nIn the sequel to the first comic book adaptation of the cartoon series, \"\", Zuko sets his younger sister Azula—now sixteen—with his father to discuss finding his long-lost mother Ursa. It is later revealed that Azula has access to letters written by Ursa to Ikem (a possible paramour), hidden away by Ozai. It is also revealed that Azula wishes to kill Ursa. Later, Zuko finds a note Azula concealed, saying that Ursa wanted to return to her hometown but refrained to protect Zuko. Ozai lied to Ursa and told her he had Ikem killed. In order to save Zuko's life, Ursa made Ozai a toxic potion he could use on his father Azulon and become Fire Lord. After her banishment, Ursa returned to her hometown and found Ikem still alive but with a new face and name given to him by a spirit to protect himself. Ursa is granted a new face as well, but chooses to have her memories of her children erased because she cannot bear the pain of having been separated from them. She then marries Ikem with her new identity and they have a daughter together. Azula tracks their mother down and almost kills her but is stopped by Zuko. Without her memories, Ursa apologizes for not loving her enough and abandoning her if she really is Azula's mother. Azula's mind is still broken and she runs off into the forest, rejecting Zuko's offer to help. Ursa has her old face and memories restored and also apologizes to Zuko, who does not blame her. In the following comic story arc, \"The Rift\", Iroh mentions Ursa and her new family are visiting the Fire Nation capital with Zuko's support.\n\nZuko is escorted back home to the Fire Nation's capital by Team Avatar to assist his mother, Ursa, and her new family adjust to royal life. Unfortunately, an ancient prophecy is foretold that Zuko must be dethroned immediately or annihilation will befall the country. A group of creatures known as the Kemurikage begin stealing children and the New Ozai society, a secret society dedicated to dethroning Zuko, start trying to cause problems to bring Zuko down. Zuko works with Mai and Aang in order to restore order, however, he acts ruthlessly with his people after his sister Kiyi is taken. Later, it is revealed that Azula had planned the whole thing despite apparently coming to terms that her destiny was not to become Fire Lord. Zuko realizes how similar he was acting to her and apologizes to his country for being a poor ruler and becomes determined to be a better one.\n\nIn \"The Legend of Korra\", now eighty-seven years old, Lord Zuko had aided the late Avatar Aang in the creation of the \"United Republic of Nations\" after the Hundred Year War. The creators of the series revealed by the time of the series, he has abdicated his position as Fire Lord in favor of his daughter, Izumi, and travels the world, usually on his dragon Druk, as an ambassador for peace. He is memorialized by a statue at Republic City's Central City Station. His grandson Iroh (also voiced by Dante Basco) serves as a general of the United Forces alongside Aang's eldest son, Bumi.\n\nMaking his debut in \"Book Three: Change\", Zuko is revealed to have been working with the Order of the White Lotus to keep major threats in check while Korra was still in training. Most notably, he worked alongside Sokka, Tenzin (Aang's younger son), and Korra's father Tonraq to thwart an attempt by the criminal Zaheer and his Red Lotus followers to kidnap Korra when she was a child. Fourteen years later, Zuko learned of Zaheer's new air bending skills and subsequent escape. He enlists Korra's father Tonraq and her cousins, Desna and Eska, to keep the last of Zaheer's allies from being freed, but their efforts were unsuccessful. When Zaheer fatally suffocated Earth Queen Hou-Ting and gave an ultimatum to Korra, Zuko immediately returned to the Fire Nation, fearing the anarchists would target his daughter. Zuko briefly councils Korra regarding the situation before he departs, and is surprised to learn that the Avatar has spoken to his long-deceased uncle in the Spirit World. When Zaheer is defeated in the season finale, Zuko attends Jinora's ceremony as airbending master, and expresses concerns about the lingering threat of the Red Lotus.\n\nZuko makes a final non-speaking appearance in \"Book Four: Balance\", attending the coronation of Prince Wu with his daughter, Izumi, and the other world leaders.\n\nDespite his youth, Zuko has demonstrated great agility and strength. His chief education in this is derived from his uncle Iroh; flashbacks reveal that Zuko's skills were subpar as a preteen, but that they improved dramatically under Iroh's tutelage. He is twice shown to be a match in combat to his sister Azula, although he lacks the emotional discipline to generate lightning. He is depicted throughout the series as both powerful and skillful in both martial and aesthetic applications of firebending.\n\nZuko is highly skilled in Firebending which utilizes chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan.<ref name=\"avatar2/index.jhtml\"></ref> The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style. Firebending represents the element of power, and is categorized as the most aggressive of the \"four bending arts\". Firebender discipline stresses self-restraint and breath control as a means of directing and containing the fire manifested. Poor breath control means dangerously poor control of any fire generated. For this reason, breathing exercises are one of the most critical first steps for beginning firebenders.\n\nFirebending involves \"external styles\" that prioritize one's legwork (as opposed to the arms) and emphasizes \"kicking over hand fighting\"; the highly technical kicking strikes are meant to \"extend as far as possible\" without compromising balance. This is intended to sacrifice defense for optimized preemptive strikes and attrition warfare. Zuko's interpretation of firebending uses long, aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent; quick, successive attacks that utilize momentary bursts of extreme \"explosive\" power; with fundamentally strong movements' and the usage of powerful, quick manoeuvres.\n\nZuko is skilled in \"Dao duel-wielding\", as in the episode \"The Blue Spirit\" wherein he withstands a large number of adversaries. In \"Avatar: The Lost Adventures\", it was revealed that he studied under Master Piandao, his uncle's colleague and Sokka's master sword fighting instructor. Zuko has also demonstrated an ability in stealth and unarmed combat, as when able to infiltrate a Fire Nation fortress, the Northern Water Tribe's city, and the Dai Li's base in the Earth Kingdom without detection. His proficiency at stealth was also utilized during the episode \"The Southern Raiders\" in which he and Katara stalked and cornered the former commander of the eponymous Raiders in his home village without revealing themselves. Avatar Extras revealed he has abnormal hearing and that he is also naturally gifted at playing the Tsungi horn (though he is never heard playing).\n\nZuko's character reception has been overwhelmingly positive from critics and fans alike. He is considered by many to have one of the best redemption arcs in television and animation history. Tory Ireland Mell of \"IGN\" thought it was \"painful\" to watch Zuko try to win the trust of Team Avatar as he was \"completely vulnerable, and no one cared.\" Mell found his reunion with Iroh to be \"heartwarming\". Zuko was listed by Paste Magazine as the best character from the \"Avatar\" universe, with writer Zach Blumenfeld noting his complex transformation and redemption story over the course of the series. Dante Basco received praise for his portrayal of the character.\n\n"}
{"id": "2047275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047275", "title": "Southern Nazarene University", "text": "Southern Nazarene University\n\nSouthern Nazarene University (SNU) is a private Nazarene liberal arts college in Bethany, Oklahoma.\n\nThe history of the institution is one of various mergers and, therefore, one of differing institutions. While SNU claims its founding date as 1899, that founding date refers to an institution that merged with what is now SNU: Texas Holiness University. As an Oklahoman institution, SNU dates back to 1906, with the founding of the Beulah Heights Academy and Bible School.\n\nThe roots of the original Southern Nazarene University are primarily in an orphanage of downtown Oklahoma City, founded by Miss Mattie Mallory. Mallory used her inheritance to buy property north of the city, which she named Beulah Heights, and relocated the orphanage there. Then, in 1906, the Beulah Heights Academy and Bible School opened. In 1909, the school was renamed Oklahoma Holiness College and new property was purchased to the west of Oklahoma City at Bethany. That same year the surrounding holiness community became Nazarene and, as its church base swelled, the school’s financial problems \"proved less threatening than those at other institutions\". The school eventually changed its name in 1918 to Oklahoma Nazarene College, when the first Nazarene Educational Regions were established.\n\nWhen Peniel College merged with Oklahoma Nazarene College in 1920, the name changed to Bethany-Peniel College. Peniel was the first of four fellow Nazarene institutions that would be absorbed by the Oklahoma school. The second institution was Central Nazarene College, another Nazarene school in Texas, in 1929. Two years later, Arkansas Holiness College was absorbed by Bethany-Peniel. The last merger was Bresee Theological College, in 1940. As historian Timothy L. Smith wrote, \"It eventually outdistanced and absorbed the schools at Hutchinson, Kansas, Peniel and Hamlin, Texas, Vilonia, Arkansas, and Des Arc, Missouri. Bethany became the Nazarene center for the whole Southwest.\"\n\nIn 1955, the name changed again from Bethany-Peniel College to Bethany Nazarene College (BNC) to avoid confusion with the term \"penal\" or \"penal colony\", and again in 1986, from Bethany Nazarene College to Southern Nazarene University (SNU).\n\nThe main campus is located in Bethany, Oklahoma. Since 1990, SNU has also maintained a presence in Tulsa, providing adult and professional programs.\n\nSNU is one of eight regional U.S. liberal arts colleges affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene. SNU represents the \"South Central Region\". In terms of the Church of the Nazarene, the \"South Central Region\" comprises the Oklahoma, Northeast Oklahoma, Southwest Oklahoma, Texas-Oklahoma Latino, West Texas, South Texas, Dallas, North Arkansas, South Arkansas, and Louisiana districts, which include Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. Each college receives financial backing from the Nazarene churches on its region; part of each church budget is paid into a fund for its regional school. Each college or university is also bound by a gentlemen's agreement not to actively recruit outside its respective \"educational region\".\n\nSouthern Nazarene is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU). SNU has also been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools since 1956.\n\nSNU provides students undergraduate degree options in several different fields of interest. It also offers three graduate degrees and seven professional programs for adults. Southern Nazarene is an open admissions college, meaning that all who apply with a high school diploma are accepted without regard to course grades or standardized test scores; the 2007 acceptance rate for students who applied to the college was 47 percent.\n\nSNU was placed on the list in 1987 after eight faculty members were irregularly terminated in 1986. Discrepancies in the reasons for their termination led the AAUP to investigate: the initial reason given was that of financial difficulty on the part of the institution, due to a decline in student retention and the resulting drop in enrollment, while the reason given later was one of unspecified performance deficiencies in the terminated faculty members. SNU eventually offered some of the terminated faculty members monetary compensation but remained on the list for 18 years, until its administration had drafted academic tenure procedures that met AAUP standards. In 2005, the American Association of University Professors took SNU off its censure list.\n\nA report released in April 2008 found that, of the U.S. institutions surveyed based on data provided under the 1990 Student Right-to-Know Act, SNU had the 17th-largest gap between the average graduation rate for white students and the average graduation rate for black students. White students had an average graduation rate of 50 percent, 7 points below the national average for all students, while black students at SNU were found to have an average graduation rate of 14 percent, 35 points below their white peers. 11 percent of the student population at SNU is black.\n\nIn a separate report issued in 2009 by the American Enterprise Institute, SNU was found to have the 8th-highest graduation rate among noncompetitive institutions in the U.S., with an average graduation rate of 54 percent. Noncompetitive institutions were defined in the report as institutions that \"require only evidence of graduation from an accredited high school\" for admission.\n\nThere were 2,090 students at SNU in 2007, 1,656 of whom were undergraduates. SNU provides on-campus apartments and various dormitories. All students under the age of 22 must live on-campus, although exceptions are made for local students living with families. The housing options include Bracken Hall and Chapman Apartments for upperclassmen,\n\nAs at most Christian colleges, there is an emphasis on spiritual development at SNU. The Office of Spiritual Development is presided over by a Vice President (VP) of Spiritual Development and Chapel services take place each Tuesday and Thursday in Herrick Auditorium. Students are required to go to 25 of 30 chapels offered. There are also alternative chapel credit opportunities available to students: small groups, a student led testimony service, and community service. Chapel speakers and musical groups are arranged by the VP of Spiritual Development. The Office of Spiritual Development work with the SGA Campus Ministries leaders to provide special class chapels and spiritual life retreats.\n\nThe Student Government Association (SGA) coordinates events and services for students. The SGA is broken up into four councils executives: Campus Ministries, Athletic Relations, Publicity, Social Life, Finance, and Presidents, along with the editors for the two SNU publications the campus newspaper, \"The Echo\", formerly \"The Reveille Echo\", and the campus yearbook, \"The Arrow\". Each SGA \"exec\", preside over sub-councils and have a representative on the class level. The SGA councils are responsible for hosting school activities, including the SNL (Southern Nazarene Live) talent contest, T.W.I.R.P., Heart-Pal Banquet, Junior-Senior Banquet, class chapels, and class parties.\n\nThe motto of SNU is \"Character, Culture, Christ\". This was first used in 1931 in a student publication called \"The Reflector.\" In 1948, under the presidency of Roy H. Cantrell the motto was officially revised and adopted by the staff. This change is detailed in this excerpt from Dr. Cantrell's thesis \"The History of Bethany Nazarene College\" : \"Character...Culture...Christ. These three words have ever been basic in the program and in the administration of Bethany-Peniel College. The noble founders of this college and their successors have consistently maintained that sound moral CHARACTER is the most insistent need in the world of men, that true CULTURE makes such moral character attractive and effective, and that the transforming power of CHRIST and the refining operation of the Spirit are indispensable in the building of the truest manhood and womanhood. This standard has ever required that the students in this college be provided with the best in educational procedure and the finest in spiritual atmosphere.\"\n\nThe lyrics for SNU's current Alma Mater were written by a committee in 1940. This committee was composed of Alice Crill, Hoyle Thomas, Marjorie Crooks, Kyle Crist, Dave McKibbon, and Madge Posey. The lyrics were revised by J. Michael Crabtree, Class of 1972, in 1986 to reflect the university's name change from Bethany Nazarene College to Southern Nazarene University. The tune used to accompany the lyrics is Annie Lisle, an 1857 ballad composed by H.S. Thompson.\n\nSNU is a member of the Great American Conference (GAC), in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division II level. SNU offers 17 sports for men and women: baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, indoor track, soccer, tennis, track and field, softball, and volleyball. SNU also competes in cheerleading. There are five facilities and sites for athletic competition and training, including the Sawyer Center (1998) for basketball, volleyball, indoor track, commencement, and other ceremonies, McFarland Park Stadium (2001) for football, the Claud & Betty Cypert Athletic Complex (2000) for baseball and softball, the Wanda Rhodes Soccer Complex (1978), and the tennis courts (1985).\n\nSouthern Nazarene University also has an equestrian center where students can learn the basics of horsemanship or move into more specialized fields of study. The SNU Equestrian Center is \"committed to furthering the education of men and women looking for a career in the Equine Industry\", which they do by offering classes like Equine Anatomy, Introduction to Equine Studies, and Introduction to Equine Reproduction. Additionally, the SNU Equestrian Center offers students the opportunity to try out for the Equestrian Team. Both English and Western riders can try out, and those who make the team participate in events sponsored by the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association\n\nThe mascot has been the \"Thunder Cat\" since 2003, the colors are crimson and white, and the athletic nickname is the Crimson Storm. Until 1999, the nickname was the Redskins, but SNU officials adopted the Crimson Storm as a response to concerns that the term \"Redskins\" as an athletic mascot was derogatory to Native Americans. The athletics program at SNU began in 1964, when it was still known as BNC, with the creation of a men's basketball team.\n\nSeveral SNU alumni have become notable as academics, politicians, and leaders in the Church of the Nazarene.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2047276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047276", "title": "El-Fish", "text": "El-Fish\n\nEl-Fish is a fish and fish-tank simulator and software toy developed by Russian game developer AnimaTek, with Maxis providing development advice. The game was published by Mindscape (v1.1) and later by Maxis (v1.1 + v1.2) in 1993 on 5 diskettes.\n\nEach fish in \"El-Fish\" has a unique Roe, similar to the genome. This allows the user to catch fish and use selective breeding and mutation to create fish to their own tastes for placing them in virtual aquariums. Around 800 possible genetic attributes (fin shape, body color, size, etc.) are available, which can be selectively shaped into virtually infinite numbers of unique fish. Once fish are created, \"El-Fish\" will algorithmically generate up to 256 animation frames so that the fish will appear to swim smoothly around the tank.\n\nThe tank simulator is very customizable for this game's era. The player can select from a large number of backdrops and tank ornaments for the fish to swim between. The user can also import their own images to use as tank ornaments. \"El-Fish\" includes a fractal based plant generator for creating unique aquarium plants. There are several \"moving objects\" that can be added to the tanks which the fish will react to, such as a cat paw, fibcrab, and a small plastic scuba diver. The user can also procedurally generate background music for their tank using an in-game composer, or choose a separate MIDI music file to be played for each virtual aquarium, and feed the fish.\n\nThe tank simulator can run as a \"memory-resident program\" in MS-DOS, making it a screensaver. Multiple tanks can be displayed via \"El-Fish\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slideshow feature.\n\n\"El-Fish\" was created by Vladimir Pokhilko, Ph.D. and Alexey Pajitnov (the creator of Tetris), who had backgrounds in mathematics, computer science, and psychology. They were attempting to create software for INTEC (a company that they started) that would be made for \"people's souls\". They developed this idea, calling it \"Human Software\", with three rules:\n\n\n\"El-Fish\" was developed by many bright minds, most with Ph.D.s, and some had worked on high-profile projects such as the Russian space program.\n\nAlthough \"El-Fish\"s demanding (for its time) system requirements prevented it from selling many units, it was an early version of what would become a very widespread genre.\n\n Has a math co-processor (sometimes called the \"387\" chip)\n\nThe animating time of a fish depends heavily on its size, where a very small fish can be animated on a 386DX40 with 4MB of RAM in 2–4 hours, a very large fish can take easily up to 24+ hours.\n\nThe performance of the game itself in the play mode varies depending how fast/slow the CPU is. The game in the Maxis version measures the speed of the CPU, so on a slow 386 it will only display 1-3 fish at once, but on a 486 it will show 10+ fish. This speed measurement will not work on modern PCs where the CPU speed exceeds the program's maximum and miscalculates the actual speed. For example, the CPU is 3600 MHz, but the program thinks the CPU is too slow and only will display 1-3 fish. This can be solved with several speed limitation software. It does not have to be slowed down to a 486's speed, but it has to fit the programs measurement calculation for displaying the maximum amount of fishes. This varies on the CPU speed. The first Mindscape version of the game does not have this bug.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"While it's true that the \"El-Fish\" graphics are darn close to state-of-the-art, it's questionable as to whether there's enough substance to warrant its purchase\". The reviewer, an aquarium owner, criticized the \"software toy\" on its \"inability to sustain the player's interest. Once the aquarium has been created and viewed, there just isn't much else happening\", with no simulation of an ecosystem needing ongoing maintenance as he had hoped.\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"El-Fish\" the 13th-worst computer game ever released.\n\n"}

{"id": "2047289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047289", "title": "Individualized Education Program", "text": "Individualized Education Program\n\nThe Individualized Education Program, often called the IEP, is a legal document under United States law that is developed for each public school child in the U.S. who needs special education. It is created through a team of the child's parent(s) and district personnel who are knowledgeable about the child's needs. IEPs must be reviewed every year to keep track of the child's educational progress.\n\nAn IEP outlines the special education experience for all eligible students with a disability. An eligible student is any child in the U.S between the ages of 3-21 attending a public school and has been evaluated as having a need in the form of a specific learning disability, autism, emotional disturbance, other health impairments, intellectual disability, orthopedic impairment, multiple disabilities, hearing impairments, deafness, visual impairment, deaf-blindness, developmental delay, speech/language impairment, or traumatic brain injury. The IEP describes present levels of performance, strengths, and needs, and creates measurable goals based on this data. It provides accommodations, modifications, related services, and specialized academic instruction to ensure that every eligible child receives a \"Free and Appropriate Public Education\" (FAPE) in the \"Least Restrictive Environment\" (LRE). The IEP is intended to help children reach educational goals more easily than they otherwise would. The four component goals are: conditions, learner, behavior, and criteria. In all cases, the IEP must be tailored to the individual student's needs as identified by the IEP evaluation process, and must help teachers and related service providers (such as paraprofessional educators) understand the student's disability and how the disability affects the learning process.\n\nThe IEP describes how the student learns, how the student best demonstrates that learning, and what teachers and service providers will do to help the student learn more effectively. Developing an IEP requires the team to evaluate the student in all areas of suspected disability, consider the student's ability to access the general education curriculum, consider how the disability affects the student's learning, and choose a federal placement for the student.\n\nAs long as a student qualifies for special education, the IEP is mandated to be regularly maintained and updated up to the point of high school graduation or prior to the 21st or 22nd birthday. If a student in special education attends university upon graduation, they are no longer \"children with disabilities\" under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) and are instead protected under Section 504. They can apply for and receive Section 504 accommodations, but the process is very different. Placements in public schools often occur in \"general education\" classrooms. Other types of placements include RSP (within a resource room), Special Day Class, Self Contained Class, Co-Teacher and specialized classes, or sub-specialties taught by a special education teacher. Students can also be removed from an IEP if it is determined the student is no longer eligible upon reevaluation.\n\nAn IEP is meant to ensure that students receive an appropriate placement not only in special education classrooms or special schools. It is designed to give the student a chance to participate in regular school culture and academics as much as is possible for that individual student. In this way, the student is able to have specialized assistance only when such assistance is absolutely necessary, and otherwise maintains the freedom to interact with and participate in activities to the same extent of their non-disabled/general education peers.\n\nIn the US, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires public schools to develop an IEP for every student with a disability who is found to meet the federal and state requirements for special education. The IEP must be designed to provide the child with a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). The term IEP refers to both the educational program provided to a child with a disability and to the written document that describes that educational program.The IDEA requires that an IEP be written according to the needs of each student who is eligible under the IDEA; an IEP must also meet state regulations. The following must be included:\n\nThe student should attend when appropriate. If the student is over fourteen, they should be invited to become a part of the IEP team. Additionally, when the student is sixteen years of age, a statement of post-secondary goals and a plan for providing what the student needs to make a successful transition is required. This transition plan can be created at an earlier age if desired but must be in place by the age of sixteen.\n\nAn IEP must also include other pertinent information found necessary by the team, such as a health plan or a behavior plan for some students.\n\nThe outcome of the IEP development process is an official document that describes the education plan designed to meet the unique needs of a student with a disability.\n\nBefore an IEP is written for a student with a disability, the school must first determine whether the student qualifies for special education services. To qualify, the child's disability must have an adverse effect on the child's educational progress.\n\nTo determine eligibility, the school must conduct a full evaluation of the child in all areas of suspected disability. Based in part on the results of the evaluation, the school along with the parents meet to review the resultsthe child's current level of performanceand to determine whether special education services are needed. In some cases, people may go undiagnosed because of strong visual memories and oral skills they pose, which can mask symptoms of having an impaired learning disorder.\n\nIf the child is found to be eligible for services, the school is required to convene an IEP team and develop an appropriate educational plan for the child. The IEP should be implemented as soon as possible after the child is determined eligible. IDEA does not state specific time-frames for each step, but each state determines its own laws for identifying the criteria regarding education and how it should be followed. States have added specific timelines that schools must follow for the eligibility, IEP development, and IEP implementation milestones.\n\nAs outlined by IDEA, students can receive free appropriate education under special education law if they fall under one of 14 categories:\n\n\nWhile teachers and school psychologists have the ability to initiate evaluations for special education service eligibility, they are unqualified to make medical diagnoses. Attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and physical and developmental delays must be diagnosed by a physician. Although most children with physical or developmental delays, who have received consistent medical care , are diagnosed at an early stage by their pediatricians, it is imperative to include a medical professional in the student's evaluation process if one of the aforementioned conditions is suspected but undiagnosed. When children are diagnosed early, they can start receiving services at earlier stages of development. State health and/or education departments offer early intervention services for children under the age of three years, while the public school system offers services for children from ages three through twenty-one.\n\nThe IEP team includes the student, the student's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), a special education teacher, at least one general-education teacher, a representative of the school or of the school district who is knowledgeable about the availability of school resources, and an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of the results of the student's evaluation (such as the school psychologist).\n\nThe parent or school may also bring other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child. For example, the school may invite related service providers, such as speech and occupational therapists. The parent may invite professionals who have worked with or assessed the child or someone to assist the parent in advocating for the needs of their child, such as a parent advocate or an attorney.\n\nIf appropriate, the child may also participate in IEP team meetings. For example, some children begin participating in their IEP meetings when they reach middle school age.\n\nA typical IEP team and team meeting includes:\n\n\nThe following people are invited, but not required to, attend:\n\n\nParents are to be considered full and equal members of the IEP team along with school personnel. Parents have the right to be involved in meetings that discuss the identification, evaluation, IEP development, and educational placement of their children. They also have the right to ask questions, dispute points, and request modifications to the plan, as do all members of the IEP team.\n\nAlthough the IEP team are required to work toward a consensus, school personnel are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the IEP includes the services that the student needs. School districts are obligated by law to make a proposal for services to the parent. If an agreement cannot be reached, the school district cannot delay in providing the services which it believes are the best services to ensure that the student receives an effective educational program.\n\nUnder IDEA Part D, the United States Department of Education funds at least one parent training and information center in each state and most territories to provide parents the information they need to advocate effectively for their child. Some centers may also provide a knowledgeable person to accompany a parent to IEP meetings to assist the parent in the process.\n\nThe school is mandated to make an effort to ensure that at least one parent is present at each IEP team meeting. If they do not attend, the school is required to show that due diligence was made to enable them to attend, including notifying the parents early enough that they have an opportunity to attend, scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place, offering alternative means of participation, such as a phone conference.\n\nThe school is required to ensure that the parent understands the proceedings of IEP team meetings and to include an interpreter for parents who are deaf or whose native language is not English.\n\nAfter the student is determined to be eligible for special education services, the IEP team is required to develop an IEP to be implemented as soon as possible after eligibility is determined. Using the results of the full individual evaluation (FIE), the IEP team works together to identify the student's present level of educational performance, as well as the student's specific academic and any related or special services that the child needs in order to benefit from their education.\n\nWhen developing an IEP, the team must consider the strengths of the student, the concerns of the parent for their student's education, results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the child (including private evaluations conducted by the parents), and the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the student. The team must also consider areas of deficit. Corresponding annual goals and objectives should be created to improve these areas. In the case of a student whose behavior impedes the their own learning or that of other children, the team is required to consider positive behavior intervention and support to address the behavior. An FBA may be required by the team to address the behavioral concerns. An FBA is conducted by a child psychologist with input from the IEP team.\n\nThe IEP team is required to consider the student's communication needs. For example, if a student is blind or visually impaired, the IEP is mandated to provide instruction in Braille unless an evaluation of the student's reading and writing skills, needs, and future needs indicate that this instruction is not appropriate for the student. If a student is deaf or hard of hearing, the team is required to consider the child's language and communication needs, including the need to communicate with school personnel and peers, and the student's need for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode. In the case of a child with limited English proficiency, the team is required to consider the language needs of the child as those needs relate to the child's IEP.\n\nA matrix is drafted containing the student's present level of performance, indicators about ways the student's disability influences participation and progress in the general curriculum, a statement of measurable goals that include benchmarks or short-term objectives, the specific educational services to be provided which include program modifications or supports, an explanation of the extent that the child will not participate in general education, a description of all modifications in statewide or district-wide assessments, the projected date for services to begin and their expected duration, the annual statement of transition service needs (beginning at age 14), a statement of inter-agency responsibilities to ensure continuity of services when the student leaves school (by age 16), and a statement regarding how the student's progress will be measured and how the parents will be informed in the process.\n\nIDEA requires a student's IEP to be developed solely based on the their needs and not on pre-existing programs or services available in the district. Whether particular services are available in the district should not be considered when identifying the services a student needs to receive an appropriate education.\n\nAfter the IEP is developed, the IEP team determines placement—the environment in which the student's IEP can most readily be implemented. IDEA requires that the IEP is completed before placement decisions are made so that the student's educational needs drive the IEP development process. Schools may not develop a child's IEP to fit into a pre-existing program for a particular classification of disability; the placement is chosen to fit the IEP, which is written to fit the student.\n\nIDEA requires state and local education agencies to educate children with disabilities with their non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. A child can only be placed in a separate school or special classes if the severity or nature of the disability prevents the student from receiving an appropriate education in the regular classroom, even with the use of supplementary aids and services. When determining placement, the starting assumption must be the student's current academic level and needs as evident by the disability.\n\nSome of the more common placement settings include the general education classroom, an integrated class, a resource class, a self-contained class, and other settings, which include separate schools and residential facilities. A school system may meet its obligation to ensure that the child has an appropriate placement available by providing an appropriate program for the child on its own, consulting with another agency to provide an appropriate program, or utilizing some other mechanism/arrangement that is consistent with IDEA. The placement group bases its decision on the IEP and which placement option is appropriate for the child. The general education classroom is seen as the least restrictive environment. In addition to the general education teacher, there will also ideally be a special education teacher. The special education teacher adjusts the curriculum to the student's needs. Most school-age IEP students spend at least 80 percent of their school time in this setting with their peers. Research suggests students with special needs benefit from being included in general education and its curriculum.\n\nAn integrated classroom is made up of mostly neurotypical children and several children who have IEPs. These are typically higher functioning children with disabilities that require help in areas of social skills. This setting allows them to model the behavior of neurotypical children. Typically, there is an aide in this classroom setting to assist those children with IEPs.\n\nThe resource class is where the special education teacher works with small groups of students using techniques that work more efficiently with the students. This setting is available for students who spend between 40- 79 percent of their time in the general education classroom. The term \"resource\" in this context refers to the amount of time spent outside general education, not the form of instruction.\n\nAnother setting option is the separate classroom. When students spend less than 40 percent of their day in the general education class, they are said to be placed in a separate class. They are allowed to work in small, highly structured settings with a special education teacher. Students in a separate class may be working at different academic levels. Other settings include separate schools and residential facilities. Students in these settings receive highly specialized training to address both special learning and behavioral needs and acquire both academic and life skills instruction. These schools have the highest degree of structure, routine, and consistency.\n\nAfter the IEP is developed and placement is determined, the student's teachers are responsible for implementing all educational services, program modifications, or supports as indicated by the individual education plan. Schools are required to have an IEP in effect at the beginning of the school year. Initial IEPs are required to be developed within 30 days after eligibility is determined, and the services specified in the child's IEP are required to be provided as soon as possible after the IEP is developed.\n\nAn initial IEP is required to be accepted and signed by a parent or guardian before any of the outlined services may begin. Formerly, parents had 30 calendar days to take the paperwork home for their consideration. Currently, the IEP must be signed or appealed within 10 days, or the school can implement the most recent version.\n\nThe IEP team is responsible for conducting an annual review to ensure that the student is meeting goals and/or making progress on the benchmarks specified for each objective. If an IEP is not helping the student in the classroom, an immediate revision is to occur.\n\nSchool personnel have an obligation to provide parents with a Procedural Safeguards Notice, which is required to include an explanation of all of the procedural safeguards built into IDEA. The information must be understandable and in the native language of the parent.\n\nA copy of the Procedural Safeguards Notice is required to be present at an IEP meeting. The school must give the parent a copy of the child's IEP at no cost.\n\nAn extensive system of conflict resolution procedures are set out in the statutory provisions. They include the right to examine records, advance notification of intent to change the educational program, the right to engage in mediation, and a right to an impartial due process hearing.\n\n\nSpecially designed instruction affects the instructional content, method of instructional delivery, and the performance methods and criteria that are necessary to help the student make meaningful educational progress. This instruction is designed by or with an appropriately credentialed special education teacher or related service provider. Students may have better success with small-group instruction as presented in a resource room (mandated by program and placement outlined in the IEP) particularly with language-based instruction.\n\nFor some students, teachers may need to present information through the use of manipulatives. For other students, teachers may need to select and teach only important key concepts and then alter evaluation activities and criteria to match this content change.\n\nThe IEP team determines whether a specific type of instruction is included in a student's IEP. Generally, if the methodology is an essential part of what is required to meet the individualized needs of the student, the methodology is included. For instance, if a student has a learning disability and has not learned to read using traditional methods, then another method is used. When including such an IEP recommendation, the team describes the components of the appropriate type of methodology, as opposed to naming a specific program.\n\nResearch has shown the importance of parental involvement in a child's education. James Griffith (1996) found that schools having higher levels of parental involvement and empowerment also had higher student criterion-referenced test scores. Although much attention has been focused on ways of involving the parent in school activities, little has been written on how to better involve parents of special education students. The U.S. Office of Education 1998 revisions to IDEA contained major changes designed to increase the parent's involvement in the educational process. These revisions required school districts to invite the parent to be involved in the diagnosis of the disability, determination of the need for special education programs and services and the extent to which the child would receive these services.\n\nModifications can be made to the program's content, such as lowering success criteria for academic success, decreasing alternative state assessments, such as off-grade level assessments, or allowing the student to receive a \"focused grade\"a grade that is recognized in a high school diploma, but is noted as \"focused\".\n\nSome of a student's educational needs may be met using class accommodations. Accommodations are typically provided by general educators within the general education environment. Accommodations do not involve modifying the material's content but rather allows students to receive information or to demonstrate what they have learned in ways that work around their impairment, thereby minimizing the likelihood of a significant disability. For example, a child may complete fewer/different parts of a homework assignment or an assessment than other students. They may also write shorter papers or be given different projects and assignments in replacement of the original task.\n\nAccommodations may also include provisions such as preferential seating, providing photocopies of teacher notes, giving oral rather than written quizzes, extended time for tests and assignments, use of a word processor or laptop, taking tests in a quiet room, prompts and reminders for focus breaks for sensory needs, and assistance with specific subject areas.\n\nModifications in the curriculum can occur if a student needs to learn material that the class has moved on from, like working on exponents while the class is moving on to applying them in the order of operations. They also may occur in grading rubrics, where a student with an IEP may be assessed on different standards than other students.\n\n\nIf the child needs additional services to access or benefit from special education, schools are required to provide the related services, which include: speech therapy, occupational or physical therapy, interpreters, medical services (for example, a nurse to perform procedures the child needs during the day, for example, catheterization), orientation and mobility services, parent counseling, and training to help parents support the implementation of their child's IEP, psychological or counseling services, recreation services, rehabilitation, social work services, and transportation. If necessary a student is provided with specialized transportation. This can be the case if the student has a severe disability and requires a wheelchair, or is identified to have an emotional problem.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the equivalent document is called an Individual Education System.\n\nCanada has similar documents called an Individualized Education Plan, a Special Education Plan (SEP), Individualized Program Plan (IPP), Student Support Plan (SSP), or an Individual Support Services Plan (ISSP), depending on the province or territory. The IEP system in Canada functions relatively similar to the US, though regulations vary between provinces.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the document is known as an Individual Education Program. In Saudi Arabia, all schools must provide an IEP for all students who have disabilities. The process of creating an IEP in Saudi Arabia may exclude the parents and other providers of services.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2047298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047298", "title": "Stokes flow", "text": "Stokes flow\n\nStokes flow (named after George Gabriel Stokes), also named creeping flow or creeping motion, is a type of fluid flow where advective inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces. The Reynolds number is low, i.e. formula_1. This is a typical situation in flows where the fluid velocities are very slow, the viscosities are very large, or the length-scales of the flow are very small. Creeping flow was first studied to understand lubrication. In nature this type of flow occurs in the swimming of microorganisms and sperm and the flow of lava. In technology, it occurs in paint, MEMS devices, and in the flow of viscous polymers generally.\n\nThe equations of motion for Stokes flow, called the Stokes equations, are a linearization of the Navier–Stokes equations, and thus can be solved by a number of well-known methods for linear differential equations. The primary Green's function of Stokes flow is the Stokeslet, which is associated with a singular point force embedded in a Stokes flow. From its derivatives, other fundamental solutions can be obtained. The Stokeslet was first derived by the Nobel Laureate Hendrik Lorentz, as far back as 1896. Despite its name, Stokes never knew about the Stokeslet; the name was coined by Hancock in 1953. The closed-form fundamental solutions for the generalized unsteady Stokes and Oseen flows associated with arbitrary time-dependent translational and rotational motions have been derived for the Newtonian and micropolar fluids.\n\nThe equation of motion for Stokes flow can be obtained by linearizing the steady state Navier-Stokes equations. The inertial forces are assumed to be negligible in comparison to the viscous forces, and eliminating the inertial terms of the momentum balance in the Navier–Stokes equations reduces it to the momentum balance in the Stokes equations:\n\nwhere formula_3 is the stress (sum of viscous and pressure stresses), and formula_4 an applied body force. The full Stokes equations also includes an equation for the conservation of mass, commonly written in the form:\n\nwhere formula_6 is the fluid density and formula_7 the fluid velocity. To obtain the equations of motion for incompressible flow, it is assumed that the density, formula_6, is a constant.\n\nFurthermore, occasionally one might consider the unsteady Stokes equations, in which the term formula_9 is added to the left hand side of the momentum balance equation.\n\nThe Stokes equations represent a considerable simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations, especially in the incompressible Newtonian case. They are the leading-order simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations, valid in the distinguished limit formula_10\n\n\n\nWhile these properties are true for incompressible Newtonian Stokes flows, the non-linear and sometimes time-dependent nature of non-Newtonian fluids means that they do not hold in the more general case.\n\n\nAn interesting property of Stokes flow is known as the Stokes' paradox: that there can be no Stokes flow of a fluid around a disk in two dimensions; or, equivalently, the fact there is no non-trivial solution for the Stokes equations around an infinitely long cylinder.\n\nA Taylor–Couette system can create laminar flows in which concentric cylinders of fluid move past each other in an apparent spiral. A fluid such as corn syrup with high viscosity fills the gap between two cylinders, with colored regions of the fluid visible through the transparent outer cylinder.\nThe cylinders are rotated relative to one another at a low speed, which together with the high viscosity of the fluid and thinness of the gap gives a low Reynolds number, so that the apparent mixing of colors is actually laminar and can then be reversed to approximately the initial state. This creates a dramatic demonstration of seemingly mixing a fluid and then unmixing it by reversing the direction of the mixer.\n\nIn the common case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the Stokes equations take the (vectorized) form:\n\nwhere formula_12 is the velocity of the fluid, formula_13 is the gradient of the pressure, formula_14 is the dynamic viscosity, and formula_4 an applied body force. The resulting equations are linear in velocity and pressure, and therefore can take advantage of a variety of linear differential equation solvers.\n\nWith the velocity vector expanded as formula_16 and similarly the body force vector formula_17, we may write the vector equation explicitly,\n\nWe arrive at these equations by making the assumptions that formula_19 and the density formula_6 is a constant.\n\nThe equation for an incompressible Newtonian Stokes flow can be solved by the stream function method in planar or in 3-D axisymmetric cases\nThe linearity of the Stokes equations in the case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid means that a Green's function, formula_21, exists. The Green's function is found by solving the Stokes equations with the forcing term replaced by a point force acting at the origin, and boundary conditions vanishing at infinity:\n\nwhere formula_23 is the Dirac delta function, and formula_24 represents a point force acting at the origin. The solution for the pressure \"p\" and velocity u with |u| and \"p\" vanishing at infinity is given by\n\nwhere\n\nis a second-rank tensor (or more accurately tensor field) known as the Oseen tensor (after Carl Wilhelm Oseen).\n\nThe terms Stokeslet and point-force solution are used to describe formula_27. Analogous to the point charge in Electrostatics, the Stokeslet is force-free everywhere except at the origin, where it contains a force of strength formula_28.\n\nFor a continuous-force distribution (density) formula_29 the solution (again vanishing at infinity) can then be constructed by superposition:\n\nThis integral representation of the velocity can be viewed as a reduction in dimensionality: from the three-dimensional partial differential equation to a two-dimensional integral equation for unknown densities.\n\nThe Papkovich–Neuber solution represents the velocity and pressure fields of an incompressible Newtonian Stokes flow in terms of two harmonic potentials.\n\nCertain problems, such as the evolution of the shape of a bubble in a Stokes flow, are conducive to numerical solution by the boundary element method. This technique can be applied to both 2- and 3-dimensional flows.\n\nHele-Shaw flow is an example of a geometry for which inertia forces are negligible. It is defined by two parallel plates arranged very close together with the space between the plates occupied partly by fluid and partly by obstacles in the form of cylinders with generators normal to the plates.\n\nSlender-body theory in Stokes flow is a simple approximate method of determining the irrotational flow field around bodies whose length is large compared with their width. The basis of the method is to choose a distribution of flow singularities along a line (since the body is slender) so that their irrotational flow in combination with a uniform stream approximately satisfies the zero normal velocity condition.\n\nLamb's general solution arises from the fact that the pressure formula_31 satisfies the Laplace equation, and can be expanded in a series of solid spherical harmonics in spherical coordinates. As a result, the solution to the Stokes equations can be written:\n\nwhere formula_33 and formula_34 are solid spherical harmonics of order formula_35:\n\nand the formula_37 are the associated Legendre polynomials. The Lamb's solution can be used to describe the motion of fluid either inside or outside a sphere. For example, it can be used to describe the motion of fluid around a spherical particle with prescribed surface flow, a so-called squirmer, or to describe the flow inside a spherical drop of fluid. For interior flows, the terms with formula_38 are dropped, while for exterior flows the terms with formula_39 are dropped (often the convention formula_40 is assumed for exterior flows to avoid indexing by negative numbers).\n\nThe drag resistance to a moving sphere, also known as Stokes' solution is here summarised. Given a sphere of radius formula_41, travelling at velocity formula_42, in a Stokes fluid with dynamic viscosity formula_43, the drag force formula_44 is given by:\n\nThe Stokes solution dissipates less energy than any other solenoidal vector field with the same boundary velocities: this is known as the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem.\n\nThe Lorentz reciprocal theorem states a relationship between two Stokes flows in the same region. Consider fluid filled region formula_46 bounded by surface formula_47. Let the velocity fields formula_7 and formula_49 solve the Stokes equations in the domain formula_46, each with corresponding stress fields formula_51 and formula_52. Then the following equality holds:\n\nWhere formula_54 is the unit normal on the surface formula_47. The Lorentz reciprocal theorem can be used to show that Stokes flow \"transmits\" unchanged the total force and torque from an inner closed surface to an outer enclosing surface. The Lorentz reciprocal theorem can also be used to relate the swimming speed of a microorganism, such as cyanobacterium, to the surface velocity which is prescribed by deformations of the body shape via cilia or flagella.\n\nThe Faxén's laws are direct relations that express the multipole moments in terms of the ambient flow and its derivatives. First developed by Hilding Faxén to calculate the force, formula_28, and torque, formula_57 on a sphere, they took the following form:\n\nwhere formula_43 is the dynamic viscosity, formula_41 is the particle radius, formula_61 is the ambient flow, formula_62 is the speed of the particle, formula_63 is the angular velocity of the background flow, and formula_64 is the angular velocity of the particle.\n\nThe Faxén's laws can be generalized to describe the moments of other shapes, such as ellipsoids, spheroids, and spherical drops.\n\n\n"}

If the mean amplitude is zero, there is no DC bias. A waveform with no DC bias is known as a \"DC balanced\" or \"DC free\" waveform.\n\nThe term originates in electronics, where \"DC\" refers to a direct current voltage. In contrast, various other non-DC frequencies are analogous to superimposed alternating current (AC) voltages or currents, hence called \"AC components\" or \"AC coefficients\".\n\nIn the design of electronic amplifier circuits, every active device has biasing to set its \"operating point\", the steady state current and voltage on the device when no signal is applied. In bipolar transistor biasing, for example, a network of resistors is used to apply a small amount of DC to the base terminal of the transistor. The AC signal is applied at the same terminal and is amplified. The bias network is designed to preserve the applied AC signal. Similarly, amplifiers using field-effect transistors or vacuum tubes also have bias circuits. The operating point of an amplifier greatly affects its characteristics of distortion and efficiency; power amplifier classes are distinguished by the operating point set by the DC bias.\n\nDC offset is usually undesirable when it causes clipping or other undesirable change in the operating point of an amplifier. An electrical DC bias will not pass through a transformer or capacitor; thus a simple isolation transformer or series-wired capacitor can be used to block or remove it, leaving only the AC component on the other side. In signal processing terms, DC offset can be reduced in real-time by a high-pass filter. For stored digital signals, subtracting the mean amplitude from each sample will remove the offset. Very low frequencies can look like DC bias but are called \"slowly changing DC\" or \"baseline wander\".\n\nDC-balanced signals are used in communications systems to prevent bit errors when passing through circuits with capacitive coupling or transformers. Bit errors can occur when a series of 1's create a DC level that charges the coupling capacitor, bringing the signal input down incorrectly to a 0-level. In order to avoid these kinds of bit errors, most line codes are designed to produce DC-balanced signals. The most common classes of DC balanced line codes are constant-weight codes and paired-disparity codes.\n\nIn audio recording, a DC offset is an undesirable characteristic of a recording sound. It occurs in the capturing of sound, before it reaches the recorder, and is normally caused by defective or low-quality equipment. The offset causes the center of the recording waveform not to be at 0, but at a higher or lower value, for example, +0.1 or -0.1. This can cause two main problems. Either the loudest parts of the signal will be clipped prematurely, since the base of the waveform has been moved up, or inaudible low-frequency distortion will occur. Low-frequency distortion may not be audible in the initial recording, but if the waveform is resampled to a compressed or lossy digital format, such as an MP3, those corruptions may become audible.\n\nA DC tape bias was used in early tape recorders to reduce distortion.\n\nA DC bias is applied to the control grid of vacuum tubes in power amplifiers in order to regulate power.\n\nOn a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), such as in a radio transmitter, selection of the center frequency of the carrier wave is done with a DC bias. For frequency modulation (FM), the AC component is the baseband audio signal plus any subcarriers. Frequency-shift keying can be done solely by changing the DC bias.\n\nThe concept has been extended to any representation of a waveform and to two-dimensional transformations like the discrete cosine transform used in JPEG.\n"}
{"id": "2047323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047323", "title": "Apostolos Andreas Monastery", "text": "Apostolos Andreas Monastery\n\nApostolos Andreas Monastery (; ) is a monastery situated just south of Cape Apostolos Andreas, the north-easternmost point of the island of Cyprus, in Rizokarpaso in the Karpass Peninsula. The monastery is dedicated to Saint Andrew and is an important site for the Cypriot Orthodox Church. It was once known as \"the Lourdes of Cyprus\", served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such it is visited by many people for votive prayers. The contents of the monastery are also noteworthy.\n\nThe traditional story of the monastery's founding says that, during a journey to the Holy Land, the ship transporting Saint Andrew went off course and struck rocks here. On coming ashore, Andrew hit the rocks with his staff, at which point a spring gushed forth. The waters proved to have healing powers and restored the sight of the ship's captain who had been blind in one eye. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage. A fortified monastery stood here in the 12th century, from which Isaac Comnenus negotiated his surrender to Richard the Lionheart. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The church of the main monastery dates to the 18th century, while the main buildings are 100 years later.\n\nMass pilgrimage, however, is only comparatively recent, dating back to the 20th century. The story is told that in 1895 the son of Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. Telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, and on hearing of a pair of birthmarks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks, and mother and son were reunited.\n\nAfter the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the number of pilgrims to the monastery dwindled, but with the opening of crossing points in 2004 more pilgrims have begun to visit the monastery. The monastery has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years, and UN funding is in place to pay for refurbishment.\n\nA bi-communal technical committee was created in 2008 to be responsible for protecting the island’s cultural heritage. The committee has been coordinating Apostolos Andreas’ restoration efforts for the past year. Initially the Church of Cyprus refused to co-operate because a document prepared by the United Nations Development Programme did not name it as the owner of the monastery, but merely donors, with Archbishop Chrysostomos II saying he was willing to let the historic monastery collapse rather than sign up to a plan that did not recognize the Church of Cyprus as the owner. However, this position was reconsidered, in late January 2013, when the United Nations formulated a proposal that the project would go ahead on a \"“multi-donor partnership”\" allowing more than one donor to fund the project. The UNDP signed separate protocol agreements with the Church of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriot EVKAF’s religious foundation EVKA.\n\nOn 12 January 2013, authorities in the north of Cyprus stated that the monastery will undergo extensive restoration costing more than 5 million Euros. The restoration work is currently being conducted by an international team of experts and is being funded by the Church of Cyprus (2,500,000EUR), EVKAF Administration (2,500,000EUR) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (25,000EUR).\n"}

In liquids it usually decreases with increasing temperature, whereas in gases viscosity increases with increasing temperature. This article discusses several models of this dependence, ranging from rigorous first-principles calculations for monatomic gases, to empirical correlations for liquids.\n\nUnderstanding the temperature dependence of viscosity is important in many applications, for instance engineering lubricants that perform well under varying temperature conditions (such as in a car engine), since the performance of a lubricant depends in part on its viscosity. Engineering problems of this type fall under the purview of tribology.\n\nHere dynamic viscosity is denoted by formula_1 and kinematic viscosity by formula_2. The formulas given are valid only for an absolute temperature scale; therefore, unless stated otherwise temperatures are in kelvins.\n\nViscosity in gases arises from molecules traversing layers of flow and transferring momentum between layers. This transfer of momentum can be thought of as a frictional force between layers of flow. Since the momentum transfer is caused by free motion of gas molecules between collisions, increasing thermal agitation of the molecules results in a larger viscosity. Hence, gaseous viscosity increases with temperature. \n\nIn liquids, viscous forces are caused by molecules exerting attractive forces on each other across layers of flow. Increasing temperature results in a decrease in viscosity because a larger temperature means particles have greater thermal energy and are more easily able to overcome the attractive forces binding them together. An everyday example of this viscosity decrease is cooking oil moving more fluidly in a hot frying pan than in a cold one.\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases allows accurate calculation of the temperature-variation of gaseous viscosity. The theoretical basis of the kinetic theory is given by the Boltzmann equation and Chapman–Enskog theory, which allow accurate statistical modeling of molecular trajectories. In particular, given a model for intermolecular interactions, one can calculate with high precision the viscosity of monoatomic and other simple gases (for more complex gases, such as those composed of polar molecules, additional assumptions must be introduced which reduce the accuracy of the theory).\n\nThe viscosity predictions for four molecular models are discussed below. The predictions of the first three models (hard-sphere, power-law, and Sutherland) can be simply expressed in terms of elementary functions. The Lennard–Jones model predicts a more complicated formula_3-dependence, but is more accurate than the other three models and is widely used in engineering practice.\n\nIf one models gas molecules as elastic hard spheres (with mass formula_4 and diameter formula_5), then elementary kinetic theory predicts that viscosity increases with the square root of absolute temperature formula_3:\n\nwhere formula_8 is the Boltzmann constant. While correctly predicting the increase of gaseous viscosity with temperature, the formula_9 trend is not accurate; the viscosity of real gases increases more rapidly than this. Capturing the actual formula_3 dependence requires more realistic models of molecular interactions, in particular the inclusion of attractive interactions which are present in all real gases.\n\nA modest improvement over the hard-sphere model is a repulsive inverse power-law force, where the force between two molecules separated by distance formula_11 is proportional to formula_12. This is not a realistic model for real-world gases (except possibly at high temperature), but provides a simple illustration of how changing intermolecular interactions affects the predicted temperature dependence of viscosity. In this case, kinetic theory predicts an increase in temperature as formula_13, where formula_14. More precisely, if formula_15 is the known viscosity at temperature formula_16, then\n\nTaking formula_18 recovers the hard-sphere result, formula_19. For finite formula_2, corresponding to softer repulsion, formula_21 is greater than formula_22, which results in faster increase of viscosity compared with the hard-sphere model. Fitting to experimental data for hydrogen and helium gives predictions for formula_21 and formula_2 shown in the table. The model is modestly accurate for these two gases, but inaccurate for other gases.\n\nAnother simple model for gaseous viscosity is the Sutherland model, which adds weak intermolecular attractions to the hard-sphere model. If the attractions are small, they can be treated perturbatively, which leads to\n\nwhere formula_26, called the Sutherland constant, can be expressed in terms of the parameters of the intermolecular attractive force. Equivalently, if formula_15 is a known viscosity at temperature formula_16, then\n\nValues of formula_26 obtained from fitting to experimental data are shown in the table below for several gases. The model is modestly accurate for a number of gases (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, air, and others), but inaccurate for other gases like hydrogen and helium. In general, it has been argued that the Sutherland model is actually a poor model of intermolecular interactions, and is useful only as a simple interpolation formula for a restricted set of gases over a restricted range of temperatures.\n\nUnder fairly general conditions on the molecular model, the kinetic theory prediction for formula_1 can be written in the form\n\nwhere formula_33 is called the \"collision integral\" and is a function of temperature as well as the parameters of the intermolecular interaction. It is completely determined by the kinetic theory, being expressed in terms of integrals over collisional trajectories of pairs of molecules. In general, formula_33 is a complicated function of both temperature and the molecular parameters; the power-law and Sutherland models are unusual in that formula_33 can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.\n\nThe Lennard–Jones model assumes an intermolecular pair potential of the form\n\nwhere formula_37 and formula_5 are parameters and formula_11 is the distance separating the centers of mass of the molecules. As such, the model is designed for spherically symmetric molecules. Nevertheless, it is frequently used for non-spherically symmetric molecules provided these do not possess a large dipole moment.\n\nThe collisional integral formula_33 for the Lennard-Jones model cannot be expressed exactly in terms of elementary functions. Nevertheless, it can be calculated numerically, and the agreement with experiment is good – not only for spherically symmetric molecules such as the noble gases, but also for many polyatomic gases as well. An approximate form of formula_33 has also been suggested:\n\nwhere formula_43. This equation has an average deviation of only 0.064 percent of the range formula_44.\n\nValues of formula_5 and formula_37 estimated from experimental data are shown in the table below for several common gases.\n\nIn contrast with gases, there is no systematic microscopic theory for liquid viscosity. However, there are several empirical models which extrapolate a temperature dependence based on available experimental viscosities.\n\nA simple and widespread empirical correlation for liquid viscosity is a two-parameter exponential:\n\nThis equation was first proposed in 1913, and is commonly known as the Andrade equation. It accurately describes many liquids over a range of temperatures. Its form can be motivated by modeling momentum transport at the molecular level as an activated rate process, although the physical assumptions underlying such models have been called into question.\n\nThe table below gives estimated values of formula_48 and formula_49 for representative liquids. Comprehensive tables of these parameters for hundreds of liquids can be found in the literature.\n\nOne can also find tabulated exponentials with additional parameters, for example\n\nand\n\nRepresentative values are given in the tables below.\n\nThe effect of temperature on the kinematic viscosity formula_2 has also been described by a number of empirical equations.\n\nThe Walther formula is typically written in the form\nwhere formula_54 is a shift constant, and formula_48 and formula_49 are empirical parameters. In lubricant specifications, normally only two temperatures are specified, in which case a standard value of formula_54 = 0.7 is normally assumed.\n\nThe Wright model has the form\nwhere an additional function formula_59, often a polynomial fit to experimental data, has been added to the Walther formula.\n\nThe Seeton model is based on curve fitting the viscosity dependence of many liquids (refrigerants, hydrocarbons and lubricants) versus temperature and applies over a large temperature and viscosity range:\n\nwhere formula_3 is absolute temperature in kelvins, formula_2 is the kinematic viscosity in centistokes, formula_63 is the zero order modified Bessel function of the second kind, and formula_48 and formula_49 are empirical parameters specific to each liquid.\n\nFor liquid metal viscosity as a function of temperature, Seeton proposed:\n\n\n"}

He made his debut for the club against Leicester City on 2 April 1977, and marked it by scoring the opening goal. Rix immediately became a regular on the left wing, replacing George Armstrong. Together with Liam Brady, he formed part of an impressive attacking midfield, which helped Arsenal to three successive cup finals between 1978 and 1980. Arsenal only won one of these, in 1979 against Manchester United; the final score was 3–2, with Rix crossing for Alan Sunderland's last-minute winner, just seconds after United had equalised to level the score 2–2.\n\nArsenal reached the Cup Winners' Cup final the following season, against Valencia; the match finished 0–0 after extra time – a penalty shootout ensued, but Rix missed his kick and Arsenal lost. After the departure of Liam Brady to Juventus that summer, many believed Rix would also leave but he stayed at the club, and became captain in 1983. Arsenal's form slumped in the early 1980s, though, meaning Rix was unable to claim any silverware as skipper. Arsenal won the 1986-87 League Cup; Rix was not part of the squad for the final against Liverpool but he contributed three appearances en route.\n\nA series of injuries to his achilles tendon kept Rix out of the team in the mid-1980s, and he lost his starting place in the side to Martin Hayes. Rix spent a spell on loan at Brentford, before being released in 1988. In all, he played 464 times for the Gunners, scoring 51 goals.\n\nAfter leaving the London club, Rix was the subject of offers from Sheffield Wednesday as well as Queens Park Rangers, but he instead signed for French club Caen, where he would spend three years before transferring to Le Havre, and then played in Scotland for Dundee before announcing his retirement as a player in 1993.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1984, Rix played for the England national team, including making five appearances at the 1982 World Cup. He was capped 17 times, but failed to score. His first appearance came on 10 September 1980 in a 4–0 win over Norway, his last in a 1–0 win over Northern Ireland on 4 April 1984.\n\nRix joined Chelsea as youth team coach in mid-1993. During an injury crisis, he briefly enlisted as a player for the club, playing a solitary Premier League match in May 1995 against his old side Arsenal. Rix became assistant manager in 1996 under new Blues boss Ruud Gullit, and continued in the same role under Gullit's successor Gianluca Vialli, winning the FA Cup in 1997, and the League Cup and Cup Winners' Cup in 1998. He won the FA Cup again in 2000, before leaving the club, after a brief spell as caretaker manager following Vialli's sacking by Ken Bates.\n\nRix managed Portsmouth between 2001 and 2002, where his enthusiastic style of management started well, but tapered off in the middle of the 2001–02 season. A string of poor results, including a 4–1 home loss in the FA Cup to bottom of the Football League Leyton Orient, meant that Director of Football Harry Redknapp was given more responsibilities until he eventually replaced Rix as team manager toward the end of the season. Rix then managed Oxford United for seven months in 2004. Their form declined sharply during the last three months of the 2003–04 Division Three campaign: they fell from the automatic promotion places to ninth in the final table, failing to achieve a playoff place. He was sacked after their poor form continued into 2004–05, where he led the club nearer to the relegation zone than to the play-offs.\n\nIn November 2005, after speculation linking him with the manager's job at Scottish Premier League club Heart of Midlothian, it was confirmed that Rix would take over at Tynecastle. He officially took the position of head coach on 8 November 2005. Events reported in February 2006, by Scottish newspapers, suggested that Rix was unhappy with Vladimir Romanov's \"hands on\" approach and speculation increased that Romanov was involved in team selection. On 22 March 2006 Rix was sacked as manager after just four months in charge, with the club citing poor results as the reason.\n\nOn 13 August 2012, Rix was named the first manager of Central FC, which was a newly formed club founded by former Trinidad and Tobago international football player Brent Sancho, that competed in the TT Pro League. Rix recorded his first league win with Central FC on 19 October 2012 with a 1–0 win over Police. Rix and Central FC parted ways through mutual consent on 21 December 2012.\n\nIn February 2013, he was appointed head coach of AFC Portchester. He left the club in August 2017.\n\nIn March 1999, Rix was sentenced to 12 months in prison, of which he served six, for having underage sex with a 15-year-old girl. He was placed on the sex offender registry for 10 years and banned by the FA from working with youth players under the age of 16. In 2013 he told \"The Independent\" that he thought she was of legal age. On his release from prison, he immediately returned to his old job. He subsequently claimed that there were \"mitigating circumstances\" in the case, saying \"I know the true story that I've never ever said\".\n\nRix has a daughter from his first marriage with Gill. After getting divorced, he married his second wife, Linda. In April 2017 Rix suffered a heart attack. In 2018, he was accused by multiple Chelsea trainees of racism and physical assault. Rix denied the allegations. The police decided after a seven-month investigation there was insufficient evidence to take any action.\n\n\n\n"}

Out of costume, he is also the host of the syndicated The Three Stooges \"Stooge-a-Palooza\" program.\n\nKoz got his start in broadcasting at WMTH-FM, the high school radio station at Maine East in Park Ridge, Illinois. While Koz was at Northwestern University, he sent the original Svengoolie, Jerry G. Bishop, material for the horror-movie program. Bishop subsequently invited Koz on to the show. When the show was cancelled in 1973, Bishop and Koz worked together doing mornings on WMAQ radio in Chicago, and Koz worked with radio legend Dick Orkin on commercials and syndicated features, including \"ChickenMan Returns for the Last Time Again.\" When Bishop left for San Diego in 1978, he gave Koz permission to create a show known as \"Son of Svengoolie\", now simply known as \"Svengoolie\". (The character is often known simply as \"Sven.\")\n\nIn June 1979, on WFLD-TV Ch. 32, Koz began as Son of Svengoolie, winning numerous local Emmy awards , and having his show syndicated to Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, and San Francisco for a brief period. In 1986, after the station was acquired by the News Corporation, WFLD canceled \"Svengoolie\", believing the show not dignified for a network affiliate. Koz did some freelance radio, including stints as a fill-in at WGN radio.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1993, Koz returned to WFLD (now \"Fox 32\") to host a new hosted movie show where he appeared to be \"breaking in\" to the Fox signal (a take-off of an actual event where WGN and WTTW had their signals pirated). The show was originally untitled, but viewers were asked to address letters to \"Lose Weight by Selling Real Estate, No Money Down\" until the show adopted the name \"The Koz Zone.\" The show featured cartoons presented by Koz, interspersed by sketch comedy bits. This show won Koz his next local Emmy, and later became the daily \"Koz Zone for Kids\". Koz also did mornings on WCKG radio for a brief period, co-hosted live 4 July and New Year's Eve programming, and became weekend and fill-in weather anchor for Fox 32 News.\n\nIn 1995, Koz came back on the air as part of the launch team for newly independent station WCIU-TV, Channel 26. He became Svengoolie (after Jerry G. Bishop -- the original Svengoolie from 1970 to 1973 -- told him he could drop the \"Son of\" because he was \"all grown up now\") and resumed weekly horror movie shows, along with numerous other duties. Koz is now well known and well regarded in the Chicago area, having won numerous regional Emmy awards and having been admitted to the NATAS/Emmy \"Silver Circle\" for \"outstanding contributions to Chicago television.\" Beginning in 2011, Koz began to be seen nationwide when his show became a regular Saturday night staple on the MeTV classic TV network.\n\nIn his Son of Svengoolie persona, Rich Koz is also known for the early '80s 3-D broadcast of \"Revenge of the Creature\" (the sequel to \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\") that resulted in a civil action lawsuit by people who felt they didn't get enough 3-D for the 89 cents they spent for the cardboard glasses. \n\nIn November 2012, Koz suffered a heart attack at his home. He had been stricken by a heart attack previously in March 2002.\n\n"}

The railway company were obliged to open it as a 'personal' station for Lord Montagu, a concession to him for allowing the railway to be built over part of his Beaulieu Estate. A special signal would indicate to the train drivers that they should stop for Lord Montagu and his guests.\n\nThe station was closed by the London and South Western Railway (which had absorbed the S&DR in 1848) on 1 March 1860, and reopened on 1 November 1895. It was destaffed in the early 1960s.\n\nNowadays the station is served by London Waterloo to Poole stopping services operated by South Western Railway. As of the December 2007 timetable, on Mondays to Fridays trains call only during the morning peak and late afternoon. From May 2008, a late morning service has also been added in each direction.

They were originally broadcast on NBC, and all of them deal with some aspect of the criminal justice system. Together, the original series, its various spin-offs, the TV film, and crossover episodes from other shows constitute over 1,000 hours of programming.\n\nShared people and resources in a common fictional setting are the connecting links between the shows, e.g., Hudson University and the \"New York Ledger\" tabloid newspaper. Many supporting characters, such as district attorneys, psychologists, and medical examiners are also shared among the shows. Occasionally, crossovers of main characters or shared storylines between two of the shows will occur. A few major characters have also left the cast of one show within the franchise only to eventually join another. The music, style, and credits of the shows tend to be similar, with the voiceover in the opening of every series performed by Steven Zirnkilton. The shows share the iconic \"dun, dun\" sound effect of a jail cell locking, created, along with the theme songs, by Mike Post. Past episodes of the American series are in syndication with local over-the-air stations, along with cable channels such as USA Network and Bravo (both owned by the franchise's production company, NBCUniversal), TNT, WGN America, Ion Television, and AMC Networks' SundanceTV and WeTV, showing episodes sometimes up to six times a day.\nIn October 2012, \"\" showrunner/executive producer Warren Leight said of the future of the \"Law & Order\" franchise, \"[Dick Wolf and I] sometimes talk in general terms of where (the franchise) could go. I'm curious to see if there's another iteration somewhere down the line,\" he says. \"We try hard to maintain a certain level of quality which I think is why the shows sustained in reruns so well. And I'd like to believe there's room for another generation in some way.\" In February 2015, NBC was purported to have interest in bringing back the flagship \"Law & Order\" as a limited series. As of February 2016, NBC has not publicly announced intentions to revive the original series.\n\n\"SVU\" follows the cases investigated by NYPD Captain Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and her Manhattan Special Victims Unit colleagues. The show's focus is on detectives who investigate sexually based crimes and crimes against children, the elderly, and women. At the start of season twenty-one, these detectives included characters portrayed by Jamie Gray Hyder, Kelli Giddish and Ice-T, while Peter Scanavino co-stars. Season twenty-one premiered on September 26, 2019. In 2020, the series was renewed through the 24th season.\n\n\"Law & Order\", a crime procedural, features both a police investigation of a crime discovered during the cold open, and a prosecution case set forth by the New York County District Attorney, at the Manhattan DA's office. The first thirty minutes of an episode typically features a lead detective trio (in the final season, Jeremy Sisto, Anthony Anderson, and S. Epatha Merkerson), while the second thirty minutes follows their legal counterparts (in the final season, Alana de la Garza, Linus Roache, and Sam Waterston). On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it was canceling the original series, although various spin-offs will continue. The series finale aired on May 24, 2010. Wolf briefly attempted to continue the series on cable, but the series \"moved into the history books\".\n\n\"Criminal Intent\" focuses on high-profile cases investigated by the Major Case Squad, with special focus on the actions of the criminals pursued, often including scenes from the victim's or perpetrator's lives not involving the police, thereby giving a hint as to the \"criminal intent\". The detectives depicted, portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe, during the final season, will often attempt to infiltrate the mind of the suspect. Julia Ormond and Jay O. Sanders also star in the tenth season of the series. On July 15, 2011, USA Network co-president Jeff Wachtel confirmed \"Law & Order: CI\" would end with its .\n\n\"Trial by Jury\", starring Bebe Neuwirth, Amy Carlson, and Jerry Orbach, followed the preparation by the legal teams, both prosecution and defense, for a jury trial. This was the first \"Law & Order\" spin-off to be canceled due to low ratings. Orbach's death (which occurred while the show was in production) was one factor to in the show's cancellation; competition from the hit series \"NUMB3RS\" was another.\n\nOriginally titled \"Law & Order: Los Angeles\", \"LA\" was the first American \"Law & Order\" series set outside of New York City. As with the original series, the first half hour of the show focused on the police investigation of a crime discovered in the cold open; the second half took place at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office and focused on the prosecution of the criminal suspect(s). On May 13, 2011, \"Law & Order: LA\" was canceled by NBC after only one season, but because of the hiatus did not air its final episode until July 11, 2011.\n\nIn April 2016, Wolf and NBC announced they were working on \"True Crime\", a scripted anthology series that will follow one significant true-to-life case per season. Season one, titled \"Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders\" stars Edie Falco as Leslie Abramson, Gaston Villanueva as Lyle Menendez, and Gus Halper as Erik Menendez. It premiered on September 26, 2017 and concluded its first season on November 14, 2017. The series is currently on hiatus.\n\nOn September 4, 2018, NBC announced that it had given an order of 13 episodes of the latest installment of the franchise entitled \"Law & Order: Hate Crimes\". However, March 4, 2019, NBC announced that the series would be heading back into redevelopment to flesh out the concept and such introduction on \"SVU\" would not take place. The series was once again touted in 2020 as part of a multi-year contract signed with creator Dick Wolf.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, NBC announced that a 13-episode order had been given to an as-yet-untitled \"Special Victims Unit\" spin-off starring Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, now the head of an organised crime task force. Meloni had previously starred on \"SVU\" from 1999 to 2011.\n\nThe \"Law & Order\" franchise has one TV film, \"\" (1998). Chris Noth reprises his role as Mike Logan, as the film explores what happened to the character following his departure from the original series.\n\nThe franchise has also spawned a series of video games for the PC, which feature appearances by then-current cast members of the TV series.\n\nThe typical course of most of the games follows the original series' format with the player investigating a crime with interviews of witnesses and examination of evidence. After the arrest is made, the player then prosecutes the case with challenges such as selecting appropriate questions for witnesses on the stand, recognizing improper questions to raise objections and selecting the most persuasive arguments for the judge to allow certain evidence in court.\n\nThe following table lists all the crossover stories in the \"Law & Order\" franchise.\n\nThe character John Munch, who originated on \"Homicide: Life on the Street\", is notable for either appearing in or being referenced in a wide variety of other series, ranging from appearing in the science fiction series \"The X-Files\", to the sitcom \"Arrested Development\", to being referenced by name in the UK crime drama \"Luther\". Whether this places these series in the \"Law & Order\" universe is a matter of debate.\n\n\"New York Undercover\" (1994–1998)\n\n\"Deadline\" (2000–2001)\n\n\"Conviction\" (2006)\n\nThe franchise, as a result of its popularity, has led to the adaptation of scripts from the American series into foreign-produced series. These are:\n\nParis enquêtes criminelles (\"Paris Criminal Investigations\") \n\"Paris Criminal Investigations\" follows the format of \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\", adapted to Paris and the French legal system, with detectives from the Prefecture of Police DRPJ and the Ministère public attempting to secure a conviction. The series stars Vincent Pérez, Sandrine Rigaux, Jacques Pater, Hélène Godec, Laure Killing, and Audrey Looten. The show is also aired in Germany on ZDF, under the title \"Law & Order: Paris\".\n\n\" Division of Field Investigations\" follows the format of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", set in Moscow and adapted to the Russian justice system. The series stars Ivan Oganesyan, Alisa Bogart, Dmitry Brusnikin, Alexander Naumov, Valery Troshin and Xenia Entelis.\n\n\"Criminal Intent\" follows the format of \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\", set in Moscow and is adapted to the Russian Justice System. The series stars Mikhail Homyakov, Igor Lagutin, Elena Kovalchuk and Boris Mironov.\n\"UK\" follows the format of the original \"Law & Order\" show but adapts it to the new setting of London, with detectives from the Metropolitan Police CID and the Crown Prosecution Service attempting to secure a conviction. The series stars Bradley Walsh, Jamie Bamber, Harriet Walter, Ben Daniels, Freema Agyeman, Bill Paterson, Paul Nicholls, Dominic Rowan, Georgia Taylor, Peter Davison, Sharon Small, Paterson Joseph, and Ben Bailey Smith.\n\nMost of the American series have been filmed almost entirely in the New York City area. The original \"Law & Order\" series has filmed a few episodes in the Los Angeles area and Baltimore; these episodes or portions of episodes were set in the cities in which they were filmed and concerned multi-jurisdictional investigations or extradition.\n\n\"Law & Order: LA\" expanded the franchise to a new main city, the new series' namesake. \"L&O: LA\" was canceled after one season.\n\nWith some frequency, actors have appeared on the various series that make up the franchise, usually as different (sometimes very different) characters. This is because filming occurs in the New York City area and thus draws from the same pool of actors. Some prominent examples of the same actor playing different roles in different episodes are:\n\nAlso due to the New York filming, a number of actors appearing in \" Law & Order\" shows have had regular or recurring roles on soaps. Most notable is Tamara Tunie, who simultaneously played both medical examiner Melinda Warner on \"SVU\" as well as (until 2007) District Attorney Jessica Griffin on \"As the World Turns\". Likewise, New York theater actors have also been frequently cast.\n\nAlso as the result of sharing the same pool of New York-based television actors, the series' casts have had significant overlap with that of the former HBO series \"Oz\". This is perhaps most pronounced in \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", whose cast has included three regularly credited actors (Christopher Meloni, BD Wong and Dean Winters), as well as two recurring actors (J. K. Simmons and Mike Doyle) who were also regularly credited actors on \"Oz\", also Kathryn Erbe from \"Oz\" starring in \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\". Similarly, \"Law & Order: UK\" sees significant overlap with other programs' casts; most prominently series regulars Freema Agyeman and Peter Davison, who starred in \"Doctor Who\" as companion Martha Jones and the Fifth Doctor as well as Bradley Walsh who joined the show at the same time as Jodie Whittaker the Thirteenth Doctor as her companion Graham O'Brien\n\n"}

After a brief career as a professional footballer, he was an English teacher and became a local councillor – serving twice as a Council Leader. He was very narrowly elected as a Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament for Ayr in 1999 but resigned at the end of the year, disillusioned at his failure to achieve office and having decided that he was uncomfortable with the mode of politics.\n\nWelsh was born and brought up in Prestwick, Ayrshire; he attended Prestwick Academy and Ayr Academy. He was a professional football player for Kilmarnock F.C., but when his football career ended he studied English Literature and History at the University of Glasgow and obtained a Diploma in Educational Management at Jordanhill College. He was employed as an English teacher at the James Hamilton Academy in Kilmarnock in 1977. He moved on to Auchinleck Academy in 1980, and became deputy Head Teacher there in 1992.\n\nWelsh went into politics as a councillor for Prestwick ward on Kyle and Carrick District Council in 1984. From the late 1980s chaired the Prestwick Airport Steering Group; he campaigned alongside Scottish MPs to preserve the monopoly which Prestwick then enjoyed on cross-Atlantic flights from Scotland. Welsh became council leader of Kyle and Carrick Council in 1990, holding office until Labour lost control of the council in 1992. In 1995 he was elected to South Ayrshire Council, and served as Leader of the Council until 1999. He left teaching in 1997 and after briefly working as Director of Human Resources and Public Affairs for Prestwick Airport, was appointed Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C.\n\nIn the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in May 1999, Welsh won the seat of Ayr by just 25 votes (0.07%) ahead of the Conservative and Unionist candidate, Phil Gallie. The seat was the most marginal of the election, and there had to be two full recounts. He was named as member of the Education, Culture and Sport committee of the Parliament. In November 1999 he cautioned the members of the committee not to intervene in delicate negotiations over funding of Hampden Park before it had a full briefing from the Minister responsible.\n\nAn assessment of the performance of each MSP by \"The Herald\" newspaper published in the middle of December 1999 noted that Welsh was only on leave of absence from being Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C., and said that he was \"clearly finding the transition to 'humble' back bencher a bit hard\". A week later, Welsh suddenly resigned his seat, explaining that the decision came after \"considerable heart searching and extended family debate\". After press speculation that he was disappointed not to have achieved high office, Welsh wrote an article explaining that as a council leader he delivered \"real service to constituents, rather than the threadbare and raddled soundbites of politicians who promise everything and deliver nothing\". At 230 days after election, he was the first MSP to resign from the job. The subsequent by-election was won by John Scott for the Conservatives, gaining the party their first ever constituency seat in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nWelsh returned to his post as Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C., but in July 2001 was appointed as Chief Executive of Rehab Scotland. He was Chief Executive of Momentum Scotland, a charity providing rehabilitation and training for disabled people, from 2001 to 2007. He was also Chairman of Borderline Theatre Company from 2002 to 2007, and became chairman of AUFA in 2007. He was Director of UK Services for the Rehab Group from 2007 to 2011. He is Chief Executive of the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland.\n\n"}

{"id": "2047446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047446", "title": "New standard tuning", "text": "New standard tuning\n\nNew standard tuning (NST) is an alternative tuning for the guitar that approximates all-fifths tuning. The guitar's strings are assigned the notes C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4 (from lowest to highest); the five lowest open strings are each tuned to an interval of a perfect fifth {(C,G),(G,D),(D,A),(A,E)}; the two highest strings are a minor third apart (E,G).\n\nAll-fifths tuning is typically used for mandolins, cellos, violas, and violins. On a guitar, tuning the strings in fifths would mean the first string would be a high B, something that was impractical until recently. NST provides a good approximation to all-fifths tuning. Like other regular tunings, NST allows chord fingerings to be shifted from one set of strings to another.\n\nNST's C-G range is wider, both lower and higher, than the E-E range of standard tuning in which the strings are tuned to the open notes E2-A2-D3-G3-B3-E4. The greater range allows NST-guitars to play repertoire that would be impractical, if not impossible, on a standard-tuned guitar.\n\nNST was developed by Robert Fripp, the guitarist for King Crimson. Fripp taught the new standard tuning in Guitar-Craft courses beginning in 1985, and thousands of Guitar Craft students continue to use the tuning. Like other alternative tunings for guitar, NST provides challenges and new opportunities to guitarists, who have developed music especially suited to NST.\n\nNST places the guitar strings under greater tension than standard tuning. Standard sets of guitar strings do not work well with the tuning as the lowest strings are too loose and the highest string may snap under the increased tension. Special sets of NST strings have been available for decades, and some guitarists have assembled NST sets from individual strings.\n\nNew standard tuning (NST) was invented by Robert Fripp of the band King Crimson in September 1983. Fripp began using the tuning in 1985 before beginning his Guitar Craft seminars, which have taught the tuning to three thousand guitarists.\n\nThe tuning is (from low to high): C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4. The original version of NST was all-fifths tuning. \nHowever, in the 1980s, Fripp never attained the all-fifth's high B. While he could attain A, the string's lifetime distribution was too short. Experimenting with a G string, Fripp succeeded. \"Originally, seen in 5ths all the way, the top string would not go to B. so, as on a tenor banjo, I adopted an A on the first string. These kept breaking, so G was adopted.\" In 2012, Fripp suggested that Guitar Circle members experiment with an A String (0.007) from Octave4Plus of Gary Goodman; if successful, the experiment could lead to \"the NST 1.2\", C2G2D3A3E4-A4, according to Fripp. In 2010, Fripp suggested renaming the tuning as \"Guitar Craft Standard Tuning or C Pentatonic tuning\".\n\nThe lowest five strings are tuned in perfect fifths from a low C. The first string is a minor third up from the E to a G. Since the lowest five strings are tuned in fifths, guitars with NST can be played with the fingerings for chords and scales used on the violin, cello, and mandolin.\n\nThe first five strings of NST have all-fifths tuning, and so its all-fifths chords are movable around the fretboard. In contrast, standard tuning has an irregular major-third interjected among its perfect fourths, which complicates the learning of chords by beginners.\n\nThe distinct open-notes {C,G,D,A,E} are the notes of the major pentatonic scale on C, which contains only consonant intervals. The C-pentatonic scale omits the open B of standard tuning and all-fifths tuning, which forms a dissonant second-interval with C. With the 1980s King Crimson, Fripp had used pentatonic harmony in \"Discipline\", \"Thela Hun Ginjeet\", and \"Sartori in Tangier\".\n\nNew standard tuning lists four notes (C,G,E,G) from the harmonic sequence (overtones) for the note C. When the low open-note C-string is struck, its harmonic sequence begins with the notes\nTo strengthen a given chord, Vincent Persichetti's \"Twentieth-century harmony\" recommends adding perfect fifths above the initial overtones, rather than adding higher overtones, such as B and the higher C. Persichetti's book influenced Fripp. In new standard tuning\n\nLike all-fifths tuning, NST has a greater range than the standard tuning, a perfect fifth greater (a major third lower and a minor third higher).\n\nAsked whether NST facilitates \"new intervals or harmonies that aren't readily available in standard tuning\", Fripp responded, \"Yes, that's part of it. It's more effective. It's a more rational system, but it's also better sounding—better for chords, better for single notes.\" To build chords, Fripp uses \"perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves\", so avoiding minor and major thirds. Quartal and quintal harmony was stressed from the beginning of Fripp's teaching of Guitar Craft. Fripp began a 1986 course with these directions: \"Now, pick a note from the following series—[it was a series of fourths or fifths]. \"When you are ready\"—do not be in any hurry, but \"when you are ready\" play your note, then pick others and play them as the situation demands it. Your first note will be the first \"intentional\" note you have played in a week.\"\n\nIt is a challenge to adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning. NST has wider intervals between consecutive strings than standard tuning.\n\nModern quartal and quintal harmony revives the polyphonic traditions of medieval Europe. Before the common practice period, European polyphony emphasized unison intervals and octaves and also perfect fifths. From the Renaissance to 1900, Western symphonic music was diatonic, emphasizing the tertian harmony of major and minor scales, keys, and chords. Much popular music, especially rock, retains diatonic harmony.\n\nWith traditional guitar strings, the low C may be loose and the high G may be too tight. Special gauges are therefore more suitable for NST. For steel-stringed acoustic-guitars, many Guitar-Craft participants use either an .011–.058 inch set or an .011–.059 inch set; string-sets may be purchased as a set from a manufacturer or purchased singly and assembled by the guitarist.\nIn 2012, a 0.007 inch gauge was being evaluated by Fripp and other members of Guitar Circle, who are considering replacing the first string's G note with an A note, the better to approximate the B note of all-fifths tuning. The 0.007 inch gauge was produced by Octave4Plus of Gary Goodman. Robert Fripp uses lighter strings for electric guitar.\n\nRobert Fripp has used the New Standard Tuning since 1984.\n\nFripp has taught NST in his Guitar-Craft courses. In Guitar Craft and since 2010 in the successor Guitar Circles, students use only New Standard Tuning. Having to use a new tuning, the students are challenged to approach their playing with greater mindfulness, putting to rest their habitual use of automatic chords or licks. With the new tuning, guitarists have to find new ways of musical expression.\n\nThe tuning is used by students of Guitar Craft, of which there have been three thousand. Guitar-Craft alumni who continue to practice NST are called \"crafty guitarists\" or \"crafties\". Some crafty guitarists formed The League of Crafty Guitarists (LCG), which toured with Robert Fripp and released several albums. The Guitar-Craft experience and the League of Crafty Guitarists trained guitarists who went on to form new bands, such as the California Guitar Trio and Trey Gunn; the California Guitar Trio and Gunn toured with Fripp as The Robert Fripp String Quintet. Other alumni of the League of Crafty Guitarists include members of Los Gauchos Alemanes, such as U.S. guitarist Steve Ball; Ball is associated with the Seattle Guitar Circle, along with LCG alumnus Curt Golden. \nThe collection \"A Plague of Crafty Guitarists\" features the following Guitar-Craft alumni, who were listed in a review by Barry Cleveland: Tobin Buttram, Nigel Gavin, Geary Street Quartet, Bill Hibbits, Janssen and Jensen, Alejandro Miniaciand From Power Trio /Project , Sur Pacifico, Playmovil, and Santos Luminosos.\nNST has been adapted for instruments besides guitar. Trey Gunn (Crimson's touch-guitar player from 1994 to 2003) and Markus Reuter (TUNER with Crimson drummer Pat Mastelotto) have adapted NST for their 8- and 10-string instruments; in 2007 Reuter used a B-F-C-G-D-A-C-D tuning. Finnish musician Heikki Malmberg uses a 7-string guitar tuned in NST with an additional low F. Additionally, British musician Michael Linden West plays the oud in NST.\n\n\n"}

Located on the bank of the river Chenab, it is the 28th largest city of Pakistan. It is also known for its intricate wooden furniture, architecture, and mosques, and is home to the Omar Hayat Mahal.\n\nThe origins of Chiniot are obscure, and historical records accurately detailing its founding are unavailable. According to some accounts, the city was founded by an ancient king's daughter named Chandan, who while on a hunting expedition, was charmed by the surrounding area, and ordered the construction of the settlement of \"Chandaniot,\" alternatively spelt \"Chandniot,\" which was named in her honour. The name Chiniot, a contracted version of the original name, eventually gained favour, though the older name had been used up until at least the 1860s.\n\nDuring Mughal rule, Chiniot was governed as part of the \"subah,\" or province, of Lahore. The city reached is zenith under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, and his governor of the area, Nawab Sadullah Khan of the \"Thahim\" tribe, who served between 1640 and 1656. Under Sadullah Khan's governorship, Chiniot's famous Shahi Mosque was built. Chiniot's artisans were renowned for their skill during the Mughal era, and were employed in the decoration of the Taj Mahal, and Lahore's Wazir Khan Mosque.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Mughal authority after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, the local Sial tribe], a tribe of Zamindar status, s under the rule of Walidad Khan was officially granted governorship of the area on account of his loyalty to the Delhi throne. Though nominally a part of the declining Mughal realm, Walidad Khan forged an largely independent state in western Punjab that controlled the region between Mankera and Kamalia Chiniot suffered heavily during the Durrani invasion of the late 1748.\n\nThe Sial state around Chiniot was encroached upon by Sikh chieftains in the north, and from Multani chiefs in the south, before coming under control of the Bhangi Misl Sikhs by 1765. The Sikhs imposed an annual tribute on the Sial chief, Inayatullah Khan, which he ceased paying in 1778 before also capturing Chiniot. He died in 1787, though the city had reverted to Bhangi Sikh rule before his death.\n\nThe city suffered during the Sikh \"Misl\" states period in which the city region's Bhangis battled the Sukerchakia \"Misl\". Chiniot was captured by Ranjit Singh in 1803, and thereafter became part of the Sikh Empire. The city was invested in Sial chief Ahmad Khan, who promised to pay tribute to Ranjit Singh's kingdom. Khan stopped paying tribute, and briefly seized full control of the region in 1808, but was decisively defeated by Ranjit Singh's forces in 1810.\n\nThe city came under British rule by 1849, and the city was constituted as a municipality in 1862. In 1875, the city's population was 11,999. During the British period, a vast network of canals were laid to irrigate Punjab, resulting in the creation of many new \"canal colonies\" around Chiniot. Chiniot's famous Omar Hayat Mahal was built between 1923 and 1935 for a businessman who made his fortune in Calcutta.\n\nChiniot is at the intersection of the Faisalabad-Sargodha and Lahore-Jhang roads. It is 158 kilometres northwest from Lahore and 38 kilometres north of Faisalabad. Chiniot city is spread over an area of 10 square kilometres with an average elevation of 179 metres (587 ft).\n\nRabwah city, the headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Community is on the other side of the Chenab River. In the center of river a worship center (or Chilla Gah) of the Sufi Bu Ali Shah Qalandar is located.\n\nChiniot city lies on left bank of the Chenab River, and is located on a small rocky hill. Much of the surrounding area consists of alluvial plains, interspersed with rocky outcroppings of slate and sandstone that reach up to 400 feet in height around Chiniot.\n\nChiniot has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSh\"). The weather in Chiniot is variable.\n\nAccording to the 1998 census, the population of Chiniot Tehsil was 965,124 (included urban 172,522). According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, the city has the population of 278,747. The language spoken is Punjabi.\n\nThe important products of Chiniot includes silk, cotton, wheat, sugar, rice, milk, pottery, wooden furniture, etc. The city's agricultural economy is largely derived from \"canal colonies\" established during British rule when a vast network of canals were laid to irrigate Punjab.\n\nChiniot is famous for his wooden furniture, and developed as a centre of woodworking given its close proximity to the Chenab River - as timber from Kashmir would be floated down the river towards Chiniot. Chiniot's artisans are renowned for their skill, and were employed in the construction of both the Taj Mahal and Wazir Khan Mosque. The city's metalworkers, along with those of Lahore, were considered the best in Punjab during the British period, and Chinioti designs and were considered superior to those of Hoshiarpur or Jalandhar. Ramzan Sugar Mills is located at Faisalabad Road.\n\nEducational institutions in Chiniot include\n\nAfter his death, Sheikh Omar Hayat's palace Omar Hayat Mahal was converted into a library by the government of Pakistan.\n\nChiniot is connected with the rest of Pakistan by a main highway and rail line. The nearest international airport is Faisalabad International Airport, which is 48.5 kilometres from Chiniot.\n\nThe railway track is the easiest and cheapest way of transportation. Chiniot railway is a main source of transporting the furniture from Chiniot to the rest of Pakistan; it is a main source of importing the wood for furniture from all over Pakistan. Chiniot Railway Station was built in 1927 during the British Raj. It was a great step for the local economy.\n\nKhatm-e-Nabuwat Chowk is the main place of and main intersection between GT roads connecting large cities of Pakistan. Chiniot Bridge is crossing over Chenab river on the Chiniot-Sargodha road.\n\nIn Chiniot people celebrate Islamic occasions with great arrangements. On 12 Rabi' al-awwal, 1440th birthday celebration of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, people of Chiniot arranged a 63-maund cake, one of the largest cakes in the world.\n\nChiniot is known for its furniture. Chinioti craftsmen and artisans have for centuries carved flowers and geometric patterns onto cellulose fibres. Masons from Chiniot are thought to have been employed during the construction of the Taj Mahal and Golden Temple.\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in Chiniot. Football is also played in Chiniot. Other popular sports include Hockey, Volleyball, Basketball, Badminton, Tennis, Kabbadi, and Horse racing.\n\nChiniot region was agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley Civilization.

{"id": "2047474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047474", "title": "Phillip DeFreitas", "text": "Phillip DeFreitas\n\nPhillip Anthony Jason \"Daffy\" DeFreitas (born 18 February 1966) is a former English cricketer. He played county cricket for Leicestershire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, as well as appearing in 44 Test matches and 103 ODIs. Cricket writer Colin Bateman noted that \"DeFreitas was an explosive hitter when the mood took him, an aggressive pace bowler, inclined to pitch everything short and a spectacular fielder\".\n\nDeFreitas has the distinction of being the only player in the history of the County Championship to take a five-wicket haul against each of the 18 first-class counties.\n\nDeFreitas went to Willesden High School, in London, where he played football and cricket. He had trials at Luton Town F.C., but although offered an apprenticeship, wanted to play cricket.\n\nDeFreitas made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in 1985 against Oxford University and recorded the startling bowling analysis of 3.4–2–3–3 as the students collapsed to a humiliating 24 all out. The following year he had a wonderful season, taking what was to remain a career high of 94 wickets and scoring his maiden century (at number 9) against Kent, and he was selected for the successful Ashes tour in 1986/87.\n\nIn the course of his 21 seasons in first-class cricket, DeFreitas had a somewhat nomadic county career, playing for Leicestershire from his debut in 1985 until 1988, then Lancashire from 1989 to 1993, and Derbyshire from 1994 to 1999. In 2000, he returned to Leicestershire, averaging over 45 with the bat that season, and captained the side in 2003 and part of 2004. He also played for the South African side, Boland, in 1993/94 and 1994/95.\n\nDeFreitas announced in April 2005 that he would retire from cricket at the end of that season. This meant that had England not beaten the Australians that summer, there would be no remaining Englishmen in first-class cricket who had played in a victorious Ashes side, but this did not happen. On hearing the news, Mike Gatting, who had captained that 1986/87 team, told the BBC: \"He's one of those guys you want in the game. It's sad he's going to retire but he's been good for the game.\" DeFreitas has the honour of being the 100th player in test cricket to take 100 wickets.\n\nHe remained part of England's plans until the advent of Dominic Cork in the mid-1990s, but was generally much less successful abroad than at home. His two best Test series were in 1991 against West Indies and, in 1994, against New Zealand, when he took 22 and 21 wickets respectively. DeFreitas was the first victim of Shane Warne's 1994 hat trick at the MCG. His top Test score of 88 was achieved during the same tour, during which he hammered Craig McDermott for 42 runs off three overs with the new ball, helped England to a win against Australia in Adelaide, and earned him the Man of the Match award. DeFreitas was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1992.\n\nDefreitas also played the 1987 World Cup, but he, on the other hand, during the match against West Indies played in Pakistan as part of the 1987 World Cup, had to stop in the middle of his run-up in order to vomit. He had not been feeling well and the searing heat had made the affliction worse. Anxious not to lose his place, he had not mentioned his illness to the captain, preferring to try and see the day through instead. He managed this, without compromising his teammates.\n\nMost would probably agree that DeFreitas never quite reached the heights his early promise suggested he would attain. In one-day internationals, DeFreitas seldom let England down – but bowled more economically than penetratively until his second Australian tour. In the World Series Cup that season, DeFreitas was often punished by the powerful Australian top order particularly Dean Jones. He performed creditably despite a persistent groin strain in the World Cup of 1992 but form was beginning to desert him by this stage.\nHe was notoriously thrashed all over the ground by Sanath Jayasuriya in the 1996 World Cup quarter final – by no means alone – in a game where England were thrashed and ended up making their tournament exit.\n\nAs well as making irregular television appearances, DeFreitas became a cricket master at Oakham School in January 2009, under the school's director of cricket, Frank Hayes. he taught at Magdalen College School, Oxford.\n\nHis autobiography, \"Daffy: My Life in Cricket\", was published on 16 June.\n"}

His father, unknown, and his mother, Luigia Laccheni, left the baby to a foundling hospital. The child was moved to Italy in August 1874 and transferred between orphanages and foster families. Lucheni worked odd-jobs in Italy, Switzerland, and Austria-Hungary. He served in the military for three years and moved to Switzerland, where he befriended anarchists in Lausanne.\n\nOn September 10, 1898, Lucheni used a tapered file to fatally stab Empress Elisabeth of Austria during her visit to Geneva. Elisabeth and her lady-in-waiting, Countess Sztáray, had departed their hotel on Lake Geneva to ride a paddle steamer to Montreux. They walked without their attendants, as Elisabeth disdained royal processions. On the docks in the early afternoon, Lucheni approached and stabbed Elisabeth below her left breast with a wooden-handled, four-inch file, the kind used to file the eyes of industrial needles. Badly wounded, she nevertheless continued walking, with the support of two other people, 100 yards to board the departing steamer. The steamer returned to shore after Countess Sztáray first noticed Elisabeth's bleeding, whereupon the Empress was carried back to the hotel on a makeshift stretcher. Two doctors pronounced her dead within an hour of the attack. Documentation of the autopsy was destroyed.\n\nLucheni was apprehended upon fleeing the scene and his file was found the next day. He told the authorities that he was an anarchist who came to Geneva with the intention of killing any sovereign as an example for others. Lucheni used the file because he didn't have enough money for a stiletto.\n\nHis trial began the next month, in October. He was furious to find that capital punishment had been abolished in Geneva, and wrote a letter demanding that he be tried in another canton, such that he could be martyred. He received the sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nLucheni wrote his childhood memoirs while in Geneva's Évêché prison. He was harassed in prison and his notebooks were stolen. He was found hanged in his cell on October 19, 1910. His head was preserved in formaldehyde and transferred to Vienna in 1986.\n\nThe assassination begot an international conference at which delegates from 21 nations defined anarchism as terrorism and resolved to begin agencies to surveil suspected anarchists and permit capital punishment for assassination of sovereigns. Elisabeth's life and subsequent murder is depicted across many stage productions, films, and novels. Lucheni's childhood memoirs were published in 1998.\n\n"}

In the 18th century, a fair was held twice a year in August and October.\n\nOld versions of the place-name include \"Guadel\" in 799, \"Wadel\" in 816, \"Vadel\" in 851, \"Wael\" in 1096, \"Gael\" as soon as 1112.\n\nIts Breton name is \"Gwazel\", that comes directly from \"Wadel > Gwadel > Gwazel\", in Breton intervocalic [d] becomes [z], like in \"mezo\" ″drunk″, Welsh \"meddw\" ″drunk″. In French intervocalic [d] disappears totally : \"Wadel > Wael\" (Latin \"cadena\" > French \"chaine\" > English \"chain\") and initial Germanic \"w-\" became \"gu-\" [gʷ] (+ \"-a\") before becoming simply [g] : \"Guadel > Gael\" (cf. Old French \"guarder\" > French \"garder\", English \"guard\"). The symbol \"ë\" means in Modern French that the preceding \"a\" has to be pronounced : \"Ga-el\" [gaɛl] (not [gɛʲl])\n\nNevertherless the place-name is not from Breton but from Gallo-Romance \"Wadellu(m)\", derived of Old Low Franconian \"*wad\" ″ford″ > French \"gué\" ″ford″ (Old Norman \"wei\" > Norman \"vey\", Picard, Walloon \"wez\"). There were always Gallo-Romance speaking communities east of Saint-Brieuc and the Breton languages disappears totally around \"Gaël\" in the Middle Ages to be replaced by Gallo.\n\nA main ford allowed to cross the Meu stream.\n\nIt is best known to English historians as being the ancestral seat of Ralph de Guader the first earl of Norfolk and Suffolk in post-Conquest England circa 1070 A.D.\n\nThis is an ancient Breton parish to the west of Rennes, whose boundaries formerly stretched to include the territories of Bran, Muel, Saint-Onen, Crouais, Saint-Méen-le-Grand, Concoret and Loscouët-sur-Meu. The parish of Gaël (Guadel) was a dependency of the Archbishopric of Saint-Malo. In the 6th and 7th centuries, Gaël was a major town in the kingdom of Domnonia.\n\nThe name is alleged to derive from the word for a ford, river-crossing or river (see Guad- and Guadal-). In local myths there was a 6th-century king Hoël (possible link to King Coel) known as the forest king or \"Rex Arboretanus\". It is a fact that the town is situated amidst the vast forests of Poutrecouët. A royal castle from this era was sited at Meu, not far from Gaël. This later became the seat of the De Montfort family. The emplacement was captured and dismantled by De Guesclin in 1372.\n\nDuring World War II, the German Luftwaffe occupied an airfield near Gaël in 1941. The Allied Air Forces based in England attacked the airfield on several occasions in 1943 and 1944 before it was seized by the United States Army in June 1944. Known as Advanced Landing Ground \"A-31\", the 354th Fighter Group based P-51 Mustang fighters at the airfield from 13 August through 17 September 1944 before moving east to Orconte in the Marne département along with the advancing Allied armies.\n\nAfter the war, the airfield was dismantled and the land returned to agricultural use.\n\nThe village lies on the left bank of the Meu, which flows southeastward through the commune.\n\nInhabitants of Gaël are called Gaëlites.\n\n\n\n"}

It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.\n\nNine Elms has residential developments along the riverside, like Chelsea Bridge Wharf or Embassy Gardens, and also three large council estates—Carey Gardens, the Patmore Estate and the Savona.\n\nNine Elms Lane was named around the year 1645, from a row of elm trees bordering the road, though a path probably existed between York House and Vauxhall from the 1200s. In 1838, at the time of construction of the London and Southampton Railway, the area was described as \"a low swampy district occasionally overflowed by the River Thames [whose] osier beds, pollards and windmille and the river give it a Dutch effect\".\n\nNine Elms railway station opened on 21 May 1838 as the first London terminus of the London & South Western Railway, (LSWR) which that day changed its name from the London & Southampton Railway. The neo-classical building was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was connected to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge by Thames steam boats. It closed in 1848 when the railway was extended via the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct to a new terminus at Waterloo (then called Waterloo Bridge). The redundant station and the adjacent area, to the north of the new main line, became the LSWR's carriage and wagon works and main locomotive works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909. The company's largest locomotive depot was located on the south side of the main line. The buildings were damaged by bombs in World War II, and closed in 1967. They were demolished in 1968 and replaced by the flower section of the New Covent Garden Market.\n\nGasworks were established in 1853, close to the existing waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. Later Battersea Power Station was built on the site.\n\nVauxhall Motors was formed in 1857 by Scottish engineer Alexander Wilson at Nine Elms, originally as Alex Wilson and Company, before moving to Luton in 1907. There was a plaque commemorating the site of the original factory at the Sainsbury's Nine Elms petrol station on Wandsworth Road which has now been demolished and replaced with a new Sainsbury's superstore and high rise apartments as part of the current Nine Elms regeneration.\n\nNine Elms is represented by three councillors who are elected to Wandsworth Council every four years. The next election scheduled to take place in May 2022.\n\nIn October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair; the new embassy was completed in December 2017, and began operating in January 2018. The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the area from its current location in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington. The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating to the area.\n\nOn 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved Ballymore Group's plans for the 15 acre development. Embassy Gardens is set to provide \"up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches\". In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about €2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.\nWork commenced in 2013 on regeneration of the area around Battersea Power Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential buildings. An essential part of the work is an extension of the London Underground to service the area. The extension will branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea - creating two new stations. The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by late 2020.\n\nPart of these plans is the creation of the linear park – a car-free area extending from Battersea Power Station to Vauxhall Cross. The park will open out onto other public areas such as shops, hotels and other parks and public squares alongside homes and residential areas. The linear park will open up onto the Thames Path in places.\n\nIn 2015, Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a £40m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico.\n\n"}

Rev. Ratu Josaia Rayawa was appointed President of the party, with Ratu Epeli Ganilau, son of former Fijian President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau and son-in-law of the then-current President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, as interim leader. Other prominent members of the party included Adi Koila Nailatikau (Mara's daughter and Ganilau's sister-in-law), Poseci Bune, Rev. Manasa Lasaro (a former Secretary-General of the Methodist Church, who had advocated banning all commercial and sporting activities on Sundays), and Josefa Vosanibola.\n\nIn the general election of 1999, the VLV was widely seen as playing a spoiler role. Campaigning on a platform of strengthening anti-corruption laws, establishing programs to eradicate poverty, and reinforcing the family unit, it took 19 percent of the indigenous Fijian vote, mostly at the expense of the SVT, which lost the election. Ganilau himself failed to win a seat, however, and Bune replaced him as leader. The VLV joined the People's Coalition government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, and Bune and Nailatikau were appointed to the Cabinet.\n\nThe VLV splintered in the political realignment that followed the coup d'état, which deposed the Chaudhry government. Many of its members, including Rayawa and Vosanibola, joined the new Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua of interim Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, while others, including Bune, joined the Fiji Labour Party of deposed Prime Minister Chaudhry. A rump of the party continued under the leadership of Taniela Tabu and fielded two candidates, unsuccessfully, in the general election held to restore democracy in September 2001, but most members of this rump subsequently merged with members of the SVT and the New Labour Unity Party to form the Fiji Democratic Party under the leadership of the former SVT leader Filipe Bole. In 2005, this party merged into the new National Alliance Party of Fiji, founded by the former VLV leader, Ratu Epeli Ganilau.\n"}

The first scheduled train arrived from Williams on September 17 of that year; branch line trains and excursions from Southern California, Chicago, and Texas could run directly to the Rim. On June 29, 1929, service commenced on the \"Grand Canyon Limited\", which became a celebrated vacation train.\n\nThe westward train split at Barstow, one section running to San Francisco (Oakland-Richmond) via the Tehachapi Loop while the other continued to Los Angeles. In 1938 it began running via Amarillo instead of La Junta; in 1950 it became two trains west of Kansas City, one by each route.\n\nDuring World War II the \"Limited\" often ran in two or three sections carrying troops. In later years the train lost passengers to the railroad's newer trains such as the \"Super Chief\" with its streamlined cars.\n\nThe \"Grand Canyon\" train lost its name in early 1968 when the railway petitioned the ICC to drop service to Grand Canyon National Park; the train would continue as Trains 23 and 24 until the May 1, 1971, handover of all passenger service to Amtrak. While the Santa Fe had been willing to continue operating its famed \"Chiefs\" and the \"San Diegan,\" the prospect of having to operate its less successful routes until at least 1976 led it to hand its passenger routes to Amtrak.

Nicknamed \"Knowledgeable Star\", he ranks third among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel portrays Wu Yong as having a fair and handsome face and a long beard – typical features of learned and sophisticated men in Chinese literature. When Wu Yong was still a teacher in a village school in Yuncheng County of Shandong province, he was already compared to Zhuge Liang and Chen Ping, two famous strategists of the Han dynasty, for his astuteness. He is hence nicknamed \"Knowledgeable Star\".\n\nWu Yong first appears in the book when he watches from his village school a fight between the constable Lei Heng and the vagabond Liu Tang. Liu has come to ask Chao Gai, the headman of Dongxi village, to partner him to hijack birthday gifts in transportation to the Imperial Tutor Cai Jing. But he was tied up by Lei's patrol group while sleeping drunk in a temple as he looked suspicious. Chao Gai got him released when Lei's group rested at his manor. But Liu still felt bitter and caught up with Lei to demand that he returned the money Chao had given him. Wu Yong, who is a friend of Chao, steps in to stop the fight when he senses Lei Heng is about to lose. Chao comes to the scene and puts an end to the fray.\n\nTaking Wu to his house, Chao Gai discloses Liu's proposal. Wu suggests recruiting the three Ruan brothers as the current team is too small. He goes to the fishing village where the Ruans live, pretending that he has come to buy fish from the fisherman brothers. He coaxes them to reveal whether they are hugely dissatisfied with their poverty and want improvement. When he tells them his real intention in calling, the Ruans welcome the invitation. The group is then joined by Gongsun Sheng, a travelling Taoist priest.\n\nWu devises the heist plan. Bai Sheng, a loafer whom Chao Gai has once helped, poses as a wine seller. Bai stops by at the Yellow Mud Ridge, where the gifts-escorting party as well as Chao's group, who disguise as date sellers, are taking a rest. Bai first sells a bucket of wine to Chao's group. Liu Tang pretends to want a free scoop from the second bucket. After he had a sip, Bai snatches the ladle from him and pours the remaining wine, which is now laced with drug, back into the bucket. Believing that the wine seller is genuine, the soldiers badger their leader Yang Zhi to allow them to buy the remaining bucket from Bai. Once they become numb all over, the seven men cart away the valuables.\n\nMad at being robbed of his gifts to his father-in-law Cai Jing, Grand Secretary Liang Shijie of Daming Prefecture orders Jizhou Prefecture, which includes Yuncheng, to quickly track down the robbers. Jizhou's authorities soon find clues and send constable He Tao to arrest the group in Chao Gai's house. However, with the help of Zhu Tong and Lei Heng, Yuncheng's chief constables, and the magistrate's clerk Song Jiang, Chao Gai, Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng and Liu Tang escape and flee to the Ruan brothers' village. There Wu Yong sets an ambush that practically wipes out the soldiers who come for them. They then seek refuge in the Liangshan Marsh.\n\nSensing that Wang Lun, the leader of Liangshan, is unwilling to take them in, Wu Yong instigates Lin Chong, who has joined earlier but has been cold-shouldered, to kill Wang. Chao Gai is then elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Wu Yong taking the second position. Then, he uses the topography of Liangshan to defeat the soldiers sent to take down the stronghold.\n\nAll his time at Liangshan Wu Yong is the outlaw band's chief strategist. His cunning helps to recruit many of the chieftains and enables Liangshan to triumph in many military conflicts. He plans the rescue of Song Jiang and Dai Zong in Jiangzhou (江州; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) and the sabotage that topples the Zhu Family Village. His beguiling tongue dupes Lu Junyi, setting him on the path to join Liangshan.\n\nAlthough Wu Yong is sceptical about Song Jiang's quest for imperial amnesty, he casts his lot with him. He assists Song to become Liangshan's chief following Chai Gai's death. He also persuades the rest to be receptive to the idea of amnesty. After being pardoned by Emperor Huizong, the Liangshan outlaws are sent on military campaigns against invasion by the Liao Empire and rebel forces on the Song territory. Wu Yong's resourcefulness and astuteness help win many battles in the expeditions.\n\nWu Yong is one of the few Liangshan heroes who survive the campaigns. In recognition of his contributions, he is given a prefectural appointment. One night, Song Jiang and Li Kui appear in his dream, telling him that they have been poisoned by corrupt officials. Wu Yong travels to Song Jiang's grave in Chuzhou (楚州; present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu), where he meets Hua Rong, who has had a similar dream. Consumed with grief, they hang themselves from a tree near the grave.\n\n"}

Unlike emoticons, they are not text art, and instead describe the action using words or images (similar to emoji).\n\nIn most IRC chat clients, entering the command \"/me\" will print the user's name followed by whatever text follows. For example, if a user named Joe typed \"/me jumps with joy\", the client will print this as \"Joe jumps with joy\" in the chat window.\n\nIn chat media which do not support the \"/me\" command, it is conventional to read text surrounded by asterisks as if it were emoted. For example, reading \"Joe: *jumps with joy*\" in a chat log would suggest that the user had intended the words to be performed rather than spoken.\n\nIn MMORPGs with visible avatars, such as EverQuest, Asheron's Call, Second Life and World of Warcraft, certain commands entered through the chat interface will print a predefined /me emote to the chat window and cause the character to animate, and in some cases produce sound effects.

This system, sometimes known as emergency feedwater, can be used to shut down the reactor, if normal feedwater to the steam generators fails to work. It works by pumping water to the steam generators from reserve tanks or a larger body of water (e.g. lake, river, or ocean) to remove decay heat from the reactor. PWRs are often equipped with \"motor driven\" aux feedwater systems (MDAFWs), and, as an additional measure, \"turbine driven\" aux feedwater systems (TDAFWs) that are driven not by electricity but by steam from the normal secondary side steam circuit of the plant. In contrast to emergency core cooling systems for loss-of-coolant accidents, the auxiliary feedwater system does not inject directly into the reactor core. Instead, it cools in an indirect manner by cooling the primary circuit with the reactor via the steam generators.\n"}

It is a united church formed by the union of various Protestant churches in the region, principally Anglican and Presbyterian. The Church of Bangladesh is also a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches.\n\nThe Church of Bangladesh came into being as the outcome of the separation from Pakistan. This started as a movement which focused on language and took shape through the liberation war in 1971, which created an independent Bangladesh. The Synod of the Church of Pakistan on 30 April 1974 declared and endorsed a free and independent status for the Church of Bangladesh. The Church of Bangladesh brings together the Anglican and English Presbyterian Churches.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Church of Bangladesh, efforts were made to increase local leadership. B. D. Mondal was consecrated as the first national bishop of Dhaka Diocese in 1975. He tried to follow the path of Bishop Blair, by encouraging the active participation of lay leaders from all sections of the church congregations. After the creation of the Synod, B. D. Mondal became the first moderator of the Church of Bangladesh and Michael S. Baroi the deputy moderator. At the time of B. D. Mondal's retirement, a new bishop was elected, and Paul Sarker, in January 2003, became the third national bishop of the Church of Bangladesh. Although the title 'archbishop' is not employed in this province, since the acknowledgement of the Bishop of Dhaka as a Primate within the Anglican Communion, he has been entitled to the usual archiepiscopal prefix \"the Most Reverend\". The current Primate is Samuel Mankhin, enthroned on 5 December 2018.\nThere are three dioceses of the Church of Bangladesh:\n\nErected in 1956 by dividing the Diocese of Calcutta, the diocese (originally called \"East Bengal\") covered all East Pakistan. It was in the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon until the 1970 union of the Church of Pakistan. It became the sole diocese of the Church of Bangladesh upon the church's 30 April 1974 independence. Since it was split to create Kushtia diocese, the Moderator of the Synod has usually also been Bishop in Dhaka.\n\nFounded from Dhaka diocese in 1990; the Bishop in Kushtia was \"ex officio\" Deputy Moderator until 2018, when the new Bishop in Barisal became Deputy Moderator (as the second mosty senior bishop by consecration).\n\nFormed in 2017 from Dhaka diocese.\n\nThe Church of Bangladesh is a member of the Global South. Moderator Paul Sarker attended an Anglican Church in North America meeting on 13–15 May 2017, at Holy Cross Cathedral, in Loganville, Georgia. He and Archbishop Foley Beach, of the ACNA, signed \"A Joint Statement on Communion from the Primate of Bangladesh and the Primate of the Anglican Church\", to affirm and celebrate the communion between both churches. It was also discussed how both provinces could work together with mission partnerships. The Church of Bangladesh was the first united province of the Anglican Communion to declare full communion with the ACNA.\n\nThe Church of Bangladesh wasn't represented at GAFCON III, on 17–22 June 2018, because it took place in Jerusalem, Israel, but Samuel Mankhin attended G19, the additional conference that took place in Dubai, on 25 February – 1 March 2019.\n\n"}

{"id": "2047667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047667", "title": "Minnesota Constitution", "text": "Minnesota Constitution\n\nThe Constitution of the State of Minnesota was initially approved by the residents of Minnesota Territory in a special election held on October 13, 1857, and was ratified by the United States Senate on May 11, 1858, marking the admittance of Minnesota to the Union. Nearly 120 amendments have been approved (often multiple items at once), with perhaps the most significant being a reorganization in 1974 to simplify the document, making it easier for modern readers to comprehend and reducing the extensive verbiage. It is believed that the constitution was even amended twice prior to ratification.\n\nAn election in Minnesota Territory to select Republican and Democratic delegates to a state constitutional convention was held on June 1, 1857, following passage of an enabling act by the U.S. Congress on February 26 of that year (\"The Enabling Act for a State of Minnesota\"). The Republican version, as drafted by William Winthrop, a Yale Law graduate, abolitionist, future Civil War officer, and leading scholar of military law, called for universal male suffrage. The convention was held in Saint Paul from July 13 to August 29. However, the divisions between the two political parties were so great that they each held their own separate conventions and never met together aside from five people from each party who met in a conference committee to create a document acceptable to both sides. Still, the tension was so extreme that delegates would not sign anything that had previously been signed by a member of the complementary convention.\n\nIn the end, each convention signed their own copies of the document. The two were essentially identical, but had about 300 differences in punctuation, grammar, and wording because of errors in transcription produced as copyists worked late into the night on August 28. The Republican version, written on white paper, ran 39 pages and was signed by 53 delegates, while the Democratic version, written on blue-tinged paper, was 37 pages long and had 51 signatures.\n\nOn October 13, an election to approve the constitution was held. Ballots only provided for an affirmative answer, which probably reduced the number of negative votes since doing so required altering the ballot. The tally was 30,055 for acceptance and 571 for rejection.\n\nThe territorial secretary, a Democrat, sent a certified copy of the Democratic version to Washington, D.C. to be ratified by the Senate. A copy of the Republican version was also sent by an unknown party, and there is good historical evidence to show that both versions were available to Congress members. Additionally, the Republican version was sent with the bill returned to Minnesota.\n\nThe Minnesota State Legislature began to convene before the constitution was ratified, although officials elected to other positions such as governor did not begin acting in their official roles until later. The first two acts created by the legislature were amendments to the constitution, and they were approved by voters on April 15, 1858. One authorized a loan to railroads of US$5 million, and the other related to the term of office of the first state officers. Amended constitutions were apparently the ones viewed by Congress during the ratification process. The validity of the early laws passed by the Legislature is somewhat in doubt, although they have never been challenged in court.\n\nA bill of rights is featured prominently in the constitution as Article I. There are currently seventeen sections, including many that echo the amendments to the United States Constitution by subject, but not necessarily by language. The Minnesota Supreme Court, which has final authority over how the Bill of Rights is interpreted, has given conflicting signals about when the state Bill of Rights should be interpreted differently from the federal one.\n\nFor example, Section 3 states that \"the liberty of the press shall forever remain inviolate, and all persons may freely speak, write and publish their sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right.\" The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, by contrast, states that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" Despite the affirmative protections of Section 3, the Minnesota Supreme Court has followed the majority position of most states, rejected the position of the Supreme Court of California in the landmark case of \"Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center\", and stubbornly refused to interpret such language any differently from the First Amendment. The court's most recent case on this issue was \"State v. Wicklund\", in 1999, which involved a failed attempt by fur-coat protesters to demonstrate at the privately owned but publicly financed Mall of America.\n\nBy contrast, Section 16 addresses the \"freedom of conscience,\" or more generally freedom of religion. In the 1990 case of State v. Hershberger, which involved the Amish's successful attempt to be declared exempt from a state traffic law, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed more expansive protections for Minnesotans than the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause provides.\n\nAlthough the text of Section 10 is exactly the same as the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Minnesota Supreme Court has frequently interpreted it differently, so as to provide more expansive protections for persons subject to criminal prosecution under state law. For example, in the 2003 case of State v. Carter, the court held that a police dog's \"sniff\" of a rented storage locker is a \"search\" under the state Bill of Rights even though it is not a search under the federal Bill of Rights. In the 1994 case of Ascher v. Commissioner of Public Safety, the court held that DWI sobriety checkpoints, while constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, were unconstitutional under Article 1, Section 10.\n\nSome of the other provisions in the Minnesota Bill of Rights are for trial by jury and due process of law.\n\nAmongst other rules, the state legislature may not meet in regular session \"after the first Monday following the third Saturday in May of any year.\" The governor may call a special session following that date to handle unresolved issues from the regular session or to deal with unforeseen events such as emergency funding following natural disasters.\n\nMinnesota's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, so if a biennial budget isn't passed by the end of June in an odd-numbered year, the effect is a government shutdown, as happened in 2005 and again in 2011.\n\nSimilar to the Tennessee State Constitution, bills brought before the legislature may deal with only one subject.\n\nArticle XIV of the constitution is dedicated to discussing the public highway system of the state and the methods of funding. It authorizes a trunk highway system overseen by the state and methods of funding roadways overseen by smaller political divisions within Minnesota. Sections 4 and 5 in Article X also describe the taxation of fuel and vehicles used in relation to airborne transportation, including aircraft and supplemental vehicles.\n\nIn 1920, the Babcock Amendment authorized 70 \"constitutional route\" (CR) highways cris-crossing the state. Until the 1974 modification of the constitution (see section below), these were enumerated in the document itself, though today they are listed in the Minnesota Statutes (§161.114). Still, the general routes cannot be altered or removed without amending the constitution and are therefore somewhat fixed. In many cases, the constitutional route numbers do not match highway numbers. In fact, it has been common for CR highways to be composed of several different trunk highways. When the U.S. Highway system was created in 1926, many of these roads were made up of one or more U.S. highways. Today, they now use a mix of Minnesota state highways, U.S. highways, and Interstate highways.\n\nThere is some ambiguity in how literally the Minnesota Department of Transportation must interpret the constitutional routes. In some cases, the routes no longer directly serve communities they were once designated for, but are routed along nearby interstates instead.\n\nThe strong support given to automobile and aircraft transportation is often criticized by advocates of public transportation (buses, light rail, etc.), which they believe is inappropriately funded. While highways have a consistent source of money, Metro Transit has had to frequently petition the legislature for funding.\n\nIn 1971, the legislature created a commission to study the constitution and make recommendations to maintain its utility. After reviewing the document for two years, it was recommended that the constitution be amended to rewrite it in modern language and allow easier reference. The amendment was approved by voters on November 5, 1974. This did not alter the meaning of the constitution, although if there is a case where meaning is ambiguous, the original document remains the final authority.\n\nThe earlier wording of the constitution, including all of the amendments approved since adoption in 1857, is printed in the \"Minnesota Legislative Manual 1973–74\", pages 445–484.\n\n\n"}

Much of its length goes through the Diablo Range as Mount Hamilton Road, where it is a narrow two-lane highway. The remainder of SR 130 is numbered along Alum Rock Avenue in San Jose.\n\nLegislatively, SR 130 extends east to Patterson in Stanislaus County, forming a route between the Santa Clara and San Joaquin valleys. The traversable route from Mount Hamilton is San Antonio Valley Road, but this connection remains as county roads.\n\nSR 130 begins in the west at U.S. Route 101 just east of Downtown San Jose and runs along the 4-6 lane Alum Rock Ave. It continues over a junction with Interstate 680 through San Jose's Alum Rock neighborhood. The road narrows as it begins to run into the foothills from four to six lanes down to two. Where Alum Rock Ave and Mt Hamilton Rd meet, SR 130 heads east up into the mountains along Mt Hamilton Rd, offering vistas of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and traveling through some of the last remaining ranch and naturally wild land in Santa Clara County as well as Joseph D. Grant County Park. As SR 130 approaches the base of Mount Hamilton itself, the road narrows further and is barely capable of supporting two cars abreast. The narrow road begins a series of tight switchbacks that culminate on the summit of Mount Hamilton at the Lick Observatory. The observatory also serves as the existing route's eastern terminus at around 4,200 ft. (1,280 m) elevation. When snow falls on the higher elevations of the road, it is closed until crews can clear the snow and black ice. There is a small community in this area. \n\nThough SR 130 is only signed up to this point, the road continues as San Antonio Valley Road. San Antonio Valley Rd terminates at the intersection of Mines Rd (To Livermore) and Del Puerto Canyon Rd which eventually leads to Patterson . It consists of one to two lanes, and may be considered a part of SR 130 in the future. To the west, after the continuation of SR 130 Alum Rock Rd continues as Santa Clara Street, after which it becomes SR 82, continuing north to San Francisco. There are currently no plans to designate Santa Clara St between US Route 101 and SR 82 as SR 130.\n\nA portion of SR 130 in San Jose is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nSR 130 did not exist as a state highway before 1964; however, the roads it travels had existed since Lick Observatory was built. Legislatively, SR 130 continues for 30 additional miles (48 km) east of Lick Observatory to State Route 33 in Patterson, California through the San Antonio Valley. It is not signed officially as such and is not commonly recognized as existing beyond Lick Observatory. Both locals and most map makers do not acknowledge SR 130 existing east of the summit. In addition, east of Lick Observatory the road is maintained by the county rather than the state; the eastern portion still remains technically unbuilt.\n\nRecently, signs have been erected with \"San Antonio Road\" with a small \"CA-130 East\" symbol in the upper right hand corner.\n\nMoney had been set aside by the state to study the feasibility of turning part of SR 130's legislative route from San Antonio Valley Road east to Interstate 5 into a freeway. This was intended to facilitate traffic between the Santa Clara Valley and the Central Valley; the former is experiencing population growth and real estate development. The project's main proponent was former United States Representative Richard Pombo, who was the House Resources Committee chair when in Congress and himself a member of a family with extensive Central Valley property holdings near the proposed freeway's path.\n\nThe proposed freeway's path west of San Antonio Valley Road would have bypassed Mount Hamilton either to the north toward State Route 237 or to the south toward San Jose's Evergreen district. The feasibility of the project came into question, however, as constructing a freeway over the Diablo Range near three of its highest peaks (Mount Hamilton included) would have been very difficult. The project also faced stiff opposition from taxpayers, environmentalists, residents of the area looking to preserve their area's local charm, and the Lick Observatory. (A freeway through the mountains near the observatory would render it useless by light pollution.) The freeway plan was quietly abandoned after Congressman Pombo failed in his reelection bid in 2006.\n\n"}

{"id": "2047703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047703", "title": "Bangladesh Army", "text": "Bangladesh Army\n\nThe Bangladesh Army (, \"Bangladesh Senabahini\") is the land warfare branch, and the largest of the three armed services of Bangladesh Armed Forces. The primary mission of the Army is to provide necessary forces and capabilities to deliver the Bangladeshi government's security and defence strategies, and most notably, defending the nation's territorial integrity against external attack. Control of personnel and operations is administered by the Department of the Army, Armed Forces Division. In addition to its primary mission the Bangladesh Army is also constitutionally obligated to assist the government and its civilian agencies during times of domestic national emergency. This additional role is commonly referred to as \"aid to civil administration\".\n\nThe martial tradition of Bengal has its roots in the army of Kings and their chiefs who were called Senapati or Mahasenapati. Armies were composed of infantry, cavalry, war elephants and war boats. The arrival of Muslims and the establishment of the Bengal Sultanate further strengthened the military. The sultanate had well organised disciplined armies. During Mughal rule Cannons and artillery were introduced to Bengal. During the Colonial Rule of the British, Bengal was principally a bulwark of British power and trade in the South Asian region. The British under Robert Clive defeated a 50,000 strong Bengal Army of Nawab Siraj-ud-daullah in the Polashey(Plassey) in 1757 and later the forces of Nawab Mir Qasim at the Battle of Buxar in 1764. The Army of Bengal was formed, which later became part of a united Indian Army from 1895 to 1947. The eastern part of the British India was a prominent place for military and police recruitment, with entire horse-mounted cavalry and lancer units being recruited there prior to the Bengal Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. Post-mutiny, units with the epithet \"Bengal\" in their name, such as Bengal Sappers and Bengal Cavalry, were largely recruited from non-Bengali peoples from Bihar, Varanasi and Uttar Pradesh which were technically still part of Bengal Presidency at that time. During the First World War, the Bangali Paltan was formed to recruit soldiers from Bengal. In 1916, the British Government created Bengali Double Company. The soldiers were trained in Karachi and shipped to the Bagdad. They fought in the war and after the war helped crush a rebellion by Kurds in 1919.\n\nDuring the Second World War, British Armed Forces Eastern Command created an auxiliary force who were part engineers and part infantry named as Indian Pioneer Corps. Most of the soldiers were recruited from both West and East Bengal. This force assisted the main war effort by building roads, airfields, fortifications and, when needed, fought the Japanese in an infantry role. These force was organised in company groups attached to various regiments of Indian Army in direct support role. Captain Abdul Gani was a Company Commander in the Burma front and led his troops in battle. After the war these Pioneer Troops were concentrated in Jalna, India, waiting to be demobilised and return home. In 1946 Captain Ghani the then Adjutant and Quartermaster of Indian Pioneer Corps Centre at Jalna envisioned and generated the idea of forming an Infantry regiment out of the Pioneer soldiers from East Bengal who would be returning home demobilised, to the Centre Commander. After receiving permission from the Chief of Staff of Pakistan Army General Sir Frank Messervy, he organised his men to form the nucleus of an Infantry Regiment, the Bangali Paltan (Platoon).\n\nAt the time of the creation of Pakistan Captain Ghani got the approval of the then newly appointed Commander in Chief to Pakistan Army General Messervey to form the East Bengal Regiment composed solely of youths from East Bengal, would be East Pakistan. On 17 August 1947 General Messervey while bidding farewell to the Pioneer Corps soldiers from Bombay the General endorsed the views of Captain Ghani and said' you will prove to the world that Bengali soldiers are equally competent as other nations of the world.' With these inspiring words Captain Ghani moved to Dhaka in September 1947 with two Pioneer Companies and was temporarily located in Pilkhana now the Headquarters of Border Guards Bangladesh. He was later told by the administration to find a suitable place to accommodate the soldiers. He moved to the north of the Capital and found Kurmitola as the perfect place for a cantonment. Toiling day in and day out the barracks were constructed and jungles cleared, parade ground prepared.\n\nOn 15 February 1948 the flag of First East Bengal Regiment the pioneer of Bangladesh Army was raised with Captain Ghani on the lead of all the affairs though the first commanding officer was British Lt Col V J E Patterson. and Major Abdul Waheed Choudhury a Bengali Officer from Pakistan Army Headquarters , Rawalpindi was designated as the Officer Commanding of the East Bengal Regiment , East Bengal Regiment. After the raising of the first battalion the second battalion was approved Captain Gani began to recruit the personnel for the regiment. On 7 February 1949 the flag of the Second East Bengal was raised with the newly recruited soldiers and from personnel from First East Bengal. Before the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, a total of 8 battalions of the East Bengal Regiment were formed.\n\nIn 1970 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman lead Bangladesh Awami League to win the General Elections of Pakistan. The Pakistan Army which was then in power refused to handover power and unrest broke out. On 25 March 1971 Pakistan Armed Forces cracked down on the civilian population of East Pakistan through the start of Operation Searchlight and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh. The Pakistan Army and allied paramilitaries killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and uniformed personnel. As a result, in March 1971, Bengali soldiers in East Pakistan revolted and the Bangladesh Liberation War started. There was a Bangladesh Army Sector Commanders Conference during 11–17 July 1971. The conference was held three months after the oath of the newly formed Bangladesh Government at Meherpur, Kushtia. During this conference the structure and formation as well as resolving issues surrounding the organisation of the various sectors, strategy and reinforcements of the Bangladeshi forces was determined. It was of considerable historical importance from a tactical point of view, as it determined the command structure of the Bangladeshi forces throughout Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nThis conference was presided over by the Bangladesh interim government in exile, headed by then Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed and Colonel (Retd.) M. A. G. Osmani was made the chairman of the \"Joint Chiefs of Staff\" of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. M. A. G. Osmani was reinstated into active duty from his retirement. Principal participants of this conference included: Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan, Major Ziaur Rahman, Major Abdul Jalil, Captain ATM Haider, Lt. Col. MA Rab and Major Khaled Mosharraf.\nAs a result of this meeting, Bangladesh was divided into eleven sectors. These sectors were placed under the control of Sector Commanders, who would direct the guerilla war against Pakistani occupation forces. For better efficiency in military operations each of the sectors were also divided into a number of sub-sectors. As a point of note, the 10th Sector was under direct command of the Commander-in-Chief and included the Naval Commando Unit as a C-in-C's special force.\n\nFollowing the conference a period of prolonged guerrilla warfare was launched by Bangladesh Forces, which continued for a number of months. A further restructuring was undertaken and the Bangladesh Forces were organised into three brigade size combat groups:\n\nDuring the sensitive and formative years after the end of the war, personnel of the Mukti Bahini were absorbed into different branches of Bangladesh Army. In 1974 Bangladeshi soldiers and officers repatriated from Pakistan after the Bangladesh Liberation war were absorbed into Bangladesh Army.\n\nDuring the 1972-73 tenure, engineers, signals, army services, ordnance, military police, remount veterinary and farm and medical corps was established in Bangladesh Army. Bangladesh military academy was established in Cumilla cantonment in 1974. On 11 January 1975, the passing out parade of the first Bangladesh Army short course took place. In 1975 the President Guard Regiment (PGR) was established.\n\nThere were suspicion among the army personnel of the formation of the paramilitary Jatiya Rakhi Bahini and the addition of civilian Mukti Bahini members in it. These suspicions and misconceptions laid the foundation and formed the bedrock of disputes between professional army officers and the ruling administration which led to a very bloody chapter in the history of newly independent Bangladesh.\n\nOn 15 August 1975 a few sacked army officers, disgruntled junior officers and NCOs secretly planned and assassinated President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his entire family at his personal residence in Dhanmondi, Dhaka, except for his two daughters (Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana) who were abroad. Five of those responsible officers were executed in January 2010 while others are still absconding and are outside Bangladesh. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman a new government, led by Khandkar Mushtaq Ahmed and supported by the coup plotters, was set in place. Khandakar Mushtaq passed the Indemnity ordinance which provided immunity to the assassins of Sheikh Muibur Rahman.\n\nThree months later on 3 November 1975, several senior officers and NCO's led by Maj. Gen. Khaled Mosharraf and Colonel Shafaat Jamil led their own forces to remove Khandakar Mushtaq's government from power whom they believed was an unlawful government in the first place. That same day the same group of disgruntled army personnel who assassinated Sheikh Mujib and had jailed politicians involved with the Bangladesh Liberation war, assassinated Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, Muhammad Mansur Ali and AHM Qamaruzzaman in Dhaka Central Jail. Chief of Army Staff, Major General Ziaur Rahman was placed under house arrest.\n\nOn 7 November 1975, a short but highly organised uprising concentrated only in Dhaka, formed by members of the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal (National Socialist Party) and members of enlisted personnel led by Lt. Col. (Retd.) Abu Taher also resulted in the killing of several army and air force officers and soldiers including Major General Khaled Mosharraf, Major ATM Haider. Colonel Shafaat Jamil was arrested and forcibly retired. Colonel Abu Taher released Major General Ziaur Rahman who was imprisoned by Khaled Mosharraf. Ziaur Rahman took promotion to Lieutenant General and appointed himself as the Chief of Army Staff and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. He then executed Lt. Col. Taher for his role in the coup on 7 November. Later, in 1977 under a public referendum of a yes no vote he took the helm as President. On 30 May 1981 President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in the Chattogram Circuit House in a military coup.\n\nLess than a year later, the then Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Hussein Muhammad Ershad on 24 March 1982 took power in a silent coup at dawn, suspended the constitution and imposed martial law and remained in power through farce elections and corruption. He remained in power until 6 December 1990.\n\nThe Chattogram Hill Tracts Conflict was the political and military conflict between the Government of Bangladesh and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (United People's Party of the Chattogram Hill Tracts) and its armed wing, the Shanti Bahini over the issue of autonomy and the rights of the tribes of the Chattogram Hill Tracts. The Shanti Bahini launched an insurgency against government forces in 1977, and the conflict continued for twenty years until the Bangladesh government and the PCJSS signed the Chattogram Hill Tracts Peace Accord in 1997.\n\nAt the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-President of Bangladesh Major General Ziaur Rahman created a Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust among the local tribes against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of tribal people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the Kaptai Dam by the then Pakistan government in 1962. Displaced tribesmen did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India. In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many tribesmen and a significant alteration of demographics. Having constituted only 11.6% of the regional population in 1974, the number of Bangalis grew by 1991 to constitute 48.5% of the regional population.\n\nPeace negotiations were initiated after the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991, but little progress was made with the government of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the Awami League. The Chattogram Hill Tracts Peace Accord was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997.\n\nFollowing the 1975 coup, additional personnel were absorbed into the regular army when the martial law government abolished the Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini. Under Zia's rule, Bangladesh was divided into five military regions. When Ershad assumed power in 1982, army strength had stabilised at about 70,000 troops. Starting in 1985, the army had experienced another spurt in growth. As of mid-1988, it had about 90,000 troops (although some observers believed the number was closer to 80,000), triple the 1975 figure.\n\nBangladesh Armed Forces participated in the Gulf war in 1991 Operation Desert Storm alongside other multinational forces under Allied Command. The Bangladesh Army brought in a contingent of Engineers and undertook the task of clearing mines and bombs in Kuwait. This assistance took place under the operational code name \"Operation Kuwait Punargathan (OKP)\" in English \"Operation Rebuilding Kuwait (ORK)\".\n\nThe Bangladesh Army structure is similar to the armies of the Commonwealth Nations. However, major changes have taken place following the adoption of US Army tactical planning procedures, training management techniques and noncommissioned officer educational systems.\n\nBangladesh armed forces are going through a long term modernization plan named Forces Goal 2030. Bangladesh army is under a massive expansion and modernization drive as per the plan. The force is being divided into three corps — Central, Eastern and Western. Three new infantry divisions have been raised, the 17th infantry division at Sylhet, 10th infantry division at Ramu in Cox's Bazar and 7th infantry division at Barishal-Patuakhali to make the number of total infantry divisions ten. The soldiers are being equipped with modern gear like Night Vision Goggles (NVG), Ballistic helmets, Eye protective gear, Bulletproof vest, person to person communicators, palmtop GPS device and BD-08 assault rifles with Collimator sight.\n\nTo increase special operation capabilities, 2nd Commando Battalion has been raised. The two battalions formed sole the para-commando brigade of the country. Bangladesh Army procured 44 MBT-2000 tanks from China in 2011. Bangladesh army engineers have completed the upgrade of Type 69 tanks to \"Type 69IIG\" standard. They are now upgrading 174 Type 59 tanks to Type 59G Durjoy standard. To increase the mobility of the infantry forces, 300 armoured vehicles such as BTR-80 APC, Otokar Cobra LAV and BOV M11 ARV have been procured.\n\nTo modernize the artillery forces, Nora B-52 K2 self-propelled artillery system have been procured from Serbia. Their firepower is further increased by the addition of two regiment of WS-22 Guided Multiple Rocket Launcher System. For anti-tank role Metis-M missile systems and PF-98 rocket systems were procured. Two regiments of FM 90 surface to air missile were added in 2016 to enhance air defence capabilities. The army aviation wing is also being modernized. Two Eurocopter AS365 Dauphins were put into service in 2012. Six Mil Mi-171Sh were procured in 2016. One C-295W transport aircraft was ordered from Spain which was delivered in 2017. Bangladesh Army also procured 36 \"Bramor C4EYE\" battlefield reconnaissance UAV from Slovenia in 2017.\n\nThe Bangladesh Army has been actively involved in a number of United Nations Peace Support Operations (UNPSO) since its formation in the 1970s. Its first deployments came in 1988, when it participated in two operations – UNIIMOG in Iraq and UNTAG in Namibia President HM Ershad initiated these deployments for the first time, starting with the contribution to UNIIMOG in Iraq.\n\nLater, as part of the UNIKOM force deployed to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia following the Gulf War the Bangladesh Army sent a mechanised infantry battalion (approx. 2,193 personnel). Since then, the Bangladesh Army has been involved in up to thirty different UNPKOs in as many as twenty five countries. This has included activities in Angola, Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Uganda, Rwanda, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Mozambique, former Yugoslavia, Liberia, Haiti, Tajikistan, Western Sahara, Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Georgia, East Timor, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire and Ethiopia.\n\nAs a result of its contributions to various UN peacekeeping operations, up to 88 Bangladesh soldiers have lost their lives (as of February 2009). However, the performance of Bangladesh's contingents has been described as being of the \"highest order\" and the appointment of several senior Bangladesh military officers as the Commander of UN peacekeeping missions and Senior Military Liaison Officers, may be seen as further recognition of the Bangladesh Army's growing esteem in the peacekeeping community. In January 2004, BBC described the Bangladeshi UN Force as \"Cream of UN Peacekeepers\".\n\nBangladesh Army has specialised its peacekeeping operation capabilities around the world through participation in numerous peacekeeping and nation building operations. It has created BIPSOT (Bangladesh Institute of Peace Support Operation Training) which specialises in the training of peacekeepers for employment in all types of UNPSO (UN Peace Support Operations). This institute fulfills the requirement of UNDPKO as per U.N. General Assembly resolution which outlines 'the necessity and responsibility of every nation to train their armed forces before any deployment.\n\nBangladesh Army is divided into the following administrative Corps:\nCommission is given in Bangladesh Military Academy and commissioned officers are honoured as 'first class gazetted officer' by the Bangladesh government.\nNCO rank starts from Lance Corporal. Sergeants holds key appointments in companies, batteries (company equivalent of artillery), infantry battalions and artillery regiments, e.g. Company Quartermaster Sergeant (CQMS), Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), persons holding these appointments have separate rank insignias though these are not actually ranks.\n\nCantonments are where Bangladesh Army personnel work, train, and live.\n\nUnder Army Training and Doctrine Command (ARTDOC)\n\nBangladesh has made a long term modernisation plan for its Armed Forces named Forces Goal 2030. As per the plan, Bangladesh Army will be divided into three corps — Central, Eastern and Western. A riverine brigade is being formed at Mithamain of Kishoreganj district. Government has a plan to add 97 new units within 2021. Of them, 19 units will be formed for the Sylhet Cantonment, 22 for the Ramu Cantonment and 56 units for the Sheikh Hasina Cantonment in Lebukhali. A Riverine Engineer Battalion is also going to be formed under a proposed cantonment at Mithamoine in Kishorganj. Formation of two new tank regiments is under consideration. Process of converting some regular infantry battalions into para infantry battalions and mechanized infantry battalions is also going on.\n\nBangladesh Army has started an ambitious modernisation program for its infantry soldiers named \"Infantry Soldier System\". This system includes equipping all of its soldiers with modern equipment like Night Vision Goggles (NVG), Ballistic helmets, Eye protective gear, Bulletproof vest, person to person communicators, palmtop GPS device and BD-08 assault rifles with Collimator sight. In April 2018, a RFI was published for procurement of assault rifles and submachine guns. Evaluation notice for medium range Anti-tank guided missile was also published in April 2018. In March 2018, Bangladesh Army issued tender for the procurement of 220 anti-tank weapons. The models shortlisted are Russian RPG-7V2 and Chinese \"Tyoe 69-1\".\n\nEvaluation process of 155mm howitzer also started in September 2017. In November 2017, Bangladesh army started the evaluation process of 122 mm field artillery howitzers. Later on in November 2017, the Bangladesh Army published the tender for the procurement of 105mm towed field artillery systems. In 2019, army signed contract to procure one regiment of T-300 Kasirga MMultiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) system from Turkey.\n\nBangladesh Army signed contract with China for 44 VT-5 light tanks. The tanks will be delivered within 2020. Army also selected Otokar Cobra-I as LAV and Otokar Cobra-II as the MRAP role. Hundreds of these two vehicles are being procured. In January 2020, the minister responsible for defence affairs in the parliament, Mr. Anisul Huq told the parliament that contract has been signed with an USA-based company to procure 50 MRAP vehicles with jammers. However, he did not specify the model or the company name.\n\nIn March 2018, tender was floated for two local warning radars. The models shortlisted for the tender are Ground Master 400 of Thales, \"TRML 3D/32\" of Hensoldt and \"KRONOS Land\" of Leonardo.

The enzyme is a mitochondrial protein containing a biotin prosthetic group, requiring magnesium or manganese and acetyl CoA.\n\nPyruvate carboxylase was first discovered in 1959 at Case Western Reserve University by M. F. Utter and D. B. Keech. Since then it has been found in a wide variety of prokaryotes and eukaryotes including fungi, bacteria, plants, and animals. In mammals, PC plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, and in glucose-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic islets. Oxaloacetate produced by PC is an important intermediate, which is used in these biosynthetic pathways. In mammals, PC is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with its activity found to be highest in the liver and kidney (gluconeogenic tissues), in adipose tissue and lactating mammary gland (lipogenic tissues), and in pancreatic islets. Activity is moderate in brain, heart and adrenal gland, and least in white blood cells and skin fibroblasts.\n\nStructural studies of PC have been conducted by electron microscopy, by limited proteolysis, and by cloning and gasa sequencing of genes and cDNA encoding the enzyme. Most well characterized forms of active PC consist of four identical subunits arranged in a tetrahedron-like structure. Each subunit contains a single biotin moiety acting as a swinging arm to transport carbon dioxide to the catalytic site that is formed at the interface between adjacent monomers. Each subunit of the functional tetramer contains four domains: the biotin carboxylation (BC) domain, the transcarboxylation (CT) domain, the biotin carboxyl carrier (BCCP) domain and the recently termed PC tetramerization (PT) domain. From the two most complete crystal structures available, an asymmetric and symmetric form of the protein have been visualized. The \"Staphylococcus aureus\" tetramer in complex with the activator coenzyme A is highly symmetric, possessing 222 symmetry, and has been confirmed by cryo-EM studies. In contrast the \"Rhizobium etli\", tetramer in complex with ethyl-CoA, a non-hydrolyzable analog of acetyl-CoA, possesses only one line of symmetry.\n\nPyruvate carboxylase uses a covalently attached biotin cofactor which is used to catalyze the ATP– dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate in two steps. Biotin is initially carboxylated at the BC active site by ATP and bicarbonate. The carboxyl group is subsequently transferred by carboxybiotin to a second active site in the CT domain, where pyruvate is carboxylated to generate oxaloacetate. The BCCP domain transfers the tethered cofactor between the two remote active sites. The allosteric binding site in PC offers a target for modifiers of activity that may be useful in the treatment of obesity or type II diabetes, and the mechanistic insights gained from the complete structural description of RePC (R. etli) permit detailed investigations into the individual catalytic and regulatory sites of the enzyme.\n\nThe reaction mechanism can be subdivided into two partial reactions (see figure to the right). In the first reaction, ATP is carboxylated to produce carbonic phosphoric anhydride [O(O)P(=O)O–C(=O)O] which in turn carboxylates a biotin cofactor that is covalently attached to a lysine residue of the BCCP domain. Carbonic phosphoric anhydride decomposes into carbon dioxide and phosphate prior to attack by the enzyme linked biotin molecule. In most species, this reaction requires acetyl-CoA as an allosteric activator binding to the PT domain. In the second reaction, occurring in the CT domain of an adjacent monomer, carbon dioxide is transferred to the acceptor molecule, pyruvate, to form oxaloacetate. The reaction proceeds via the removal of a proton from pyruvate, by an as yet unidentified active site residue, to generate an enolate intermediate. The enolate intermediate then attacks CO transiently released from the enzyme linked biotin molecule. The resultant oxaloacetate is released. The biotin molecule is protonated by the aforementioned active site residue and released from the active site of the CT domain to be recarboxylated. The major regulator of enzyme activity, acetyl-CoA, stimulates the cleavage of ATP in the first partial reaction and also it has been shown to induce a conformational change in the tetrameric structure of the enzyme.\n\nDuring gluconeogenesis, pyruvate carboxylase is involved in the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from pyruvate. Pyruvate is first converted by pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate (OAA) in the mitochondrion requiring hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. The OAA is then decarboxylated and simultaneously phosphorylated, which is catalyzed by one of two isoforms of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) either in the cytosol or in the mitochondria to produce PEP. Under ordinary gluconeogenic conditions, OAA is converted into PEP by mitochondrial PEPCK; the resultant PEP is then transported out of the mitochondrial matrix by an anion transporter carrier system, and converted into glucose by cytosolic gluconeogenic enzymes. However, during starvation when cytosolic NADH concentration is low and mitochrondrial NADH levels are high oxaloacetate can be used as a shuttle of reducing equivalents. As such OAA is converted into malate by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH). After export into the cytosol, malate is converted back into OAA, with concomitant reduction of NAD; OAA is subsequently converted to PEP which is available for gluconeogenesis in the cytosol along with the transported reducing equivalent NADH.\n\nVery high levels of PC activity, together with high activities of other gluconeogenic enzymes including PEPCK, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase in liver and kidney cortex, suggest that a primary role of PC is to participate in gluconeogenesis in these organs. During fasting or starvation when endogenous glucose is required for certain tissues (brain, white blood cells and kidney medulla), expression of PC and other gluconeogenic enzymes is elevated. In rats and mice, alteration of nutrition status has been shown to affect hepatic PC activity. Fasting promotes hepatic glucose production sustained by an increased pyruvate flux, and increases in PC activity and protein concentration; diabetes similarly increases gluconeogenesis through enhanced uptake of substrate and increased flux through liver PC in mice and rats. Similarly to other gluconeogenic enzymes, PC is positively regulated by glucagon and glucocorticoids while negatively regulated by insulin. Further supporting the key role of PC in gluconeogenesis, in dairy cattle, which have hexose absorption ability at adequate nutrition levels, PC and the associated gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK are markedly elevated during the transition to lactation in proposed support of lactose synthesis for milk production.\n\nAside from the role of PC in gluconeogenesis, PC serves an anaplerotic role (an enzyme catalyzed reaction that can replenish the supply of intermediates in the citric acid cycle) for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (essential to provide oxaloacetate), when intermediates are removed for different biosynthetic purposes.\n\nAs a crossroad between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, pyruvate carboxylase expression in gluconeogenic tissues, adipose tissues and pancreatic islets must be coordinated. In conditions of over nutrition, PC levels are increased in pancreatic β-cells to increase pyruvate cycling in response to chronically elevated levels of glucose. In contrast, PC enzyme levels in the liver are decreased by insulin; during periods of overnutrition adipocyte tissue is expanded with extreme expression of PC and other lipogenic enzymes. Hepatic control of glucose levels is still regulated in an over nutrition situation, but in obesity induced type 2 diabetes the regulation of peripheral glucose levels is no longer under regulation of insulin.\nIn type 2 diabetic rats, chronic exposure of β-cells to glucose due to peripheral insulin resistance results in decreased PC enzyme activity and decreased pyruvate cycling The continued overproduction of glucose by hepatocytes causes dramatic alteration of gene expression in β-cells with large increases in normally suppressed genes, and equivalent decreases in expression of mRNA for insulin, ion pumps necessary for insulin secretion, and metabolic enzymes related to insulin secretion, including pyruvate carboxylase Concurrently adipose tissue develops insulin resistance causing accumulation of triaglycerols and non-esterified fatty acids in circulation; these not only further impairing β-cell function, but also further decreasing PC expression. These changes result in the decline of the β-cell phenotype in decompensated diabetes.\n\nA deficiency of pyruvate carboxylase can cause lactic acidosis as a result of lactate build up. Normally, excess pyruvate is shunted into gluconeogenesis via conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate, but because of the enzyme deficiency, excess pyruvate is converted into lactate instead. As a key role of gluconeogenesis is in the maintenance of blood sugar, deficiency of pyruvate carboxylase can also lead to hypoglycemia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2047749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047749", "title": "Pet banks", "text": "Pet banks\n\nPet banks is a derogatory term for state banks selected by the U.S. Department of Treasury to receive surplus Treasury funds in 1833. Pet banks are sometimes confused with wildcat banks. Although the two are distinct types of institutions that arose concomitantly, some pet banks were known to also engage in practices of wildcat banking. They were chosen among the big U.S. banks when President Andrew Jackson vetoed the recharter for the Second Bank of the United States, proposed by Henry Clay four years before the recharter was due. Clay intended to use the rechartering of the bank as a topic in the upcoming election of 1832. The charter for the Second Bank of the United States, which was headed by Nicholas Biddle, was for a period of twenty years beginning in 1816, but Jackson's distrust of the national banking system (which he claimed to be unconstitutional) led to Biddle's proposal to recharter early, and the beginning of the Bank War. Jackson cited four reasons for vetoing the recharter, each degrading the Second Bank of the United States in claims of it holding an exorbitant amount of power. These reasons for vetoing the recharter were centered around Jackson's belief in his role as the representative of the common man. Amos Kendall, who was the intellectual driving force behind Jackson's 1832 election and Jackson himself, led Jackson to believe that the bank posed a political threat to Jackson. Kendall cautioned Jackson that unless he got rid of the Second Bank of the United States, it would find a way to elect its own candidate to the White House after Jackson was gone. Jackson saw the bank as a threat to the common man and \"the great enemy of republicanism\", and argued that as long as the national bank existed, the working class was constantly in danger of losing their stake in government.\n\nThe term \"pet banks\" gained currency because most of the banks were chosen not because of monetary fitness but on the basis of the spoils system, which rewarded friends and political allies of Andrew Jackson with positions in government. After winning reelection in 1832 significantly due to his argument for the removal of the Second Bank of the United States, Jackson ordered the removal of the government's deposits in the Second Bank of the United States to these pet banks, which were essentially state-chartered banks that were loyal to the Jackson administration because of the spoils system. By 1833 there were 23 \"pet banks\" or state banks with US Treasury funds. The institution of these pet banks led to a huge increase in land speculation, mainly due to the managers' inability to effectively handle and control the nation's money. The nation's banking capital, loans, and note circulation all increased by an incredible amount during the period of the pet banks because of the unqualified management, leading to an increase in land speculation during this period.\n\nMost pet banks eventually lost money and didn't succeed in their investments, partially due to the fact that the 23 pet banks were not sufficient to hold the entirety of the public's money. The pet banks and smaller \"wildcat\" banks flooded the country with paper currency. Because this money became so unreliable, Jackson issued the Specie Circular, which required all public lands to be purchased with gold and/or silver. Eventually, the way that all of the government's funds were spread throughout the country because of pet banks made it so that it was near impossible to mobilize the remaining money in the specie reserves, which were the reserves of gold and silver created by the Specie Circular. These factors ultimately contributed to the major dip in the economy that was dubbed the Panic of 1837.\n"}

However, the line was re-opened in the 1980s in an attempt to stimulate jobs and employment in the valley in response to the closure of the last few coal mines.\n\nIn 2005, following further grant from the Welsh Assembly, the stations at Abercynon, Penrhiwceiber, Fernhill, Cwmbach and Aberdare were extended to four-car length to accommodate longer peak trains in an initiative to relieve overcrowding, train leasing/running costs also funded by the Welsh Assembly Government.\n\nThe line follows the Rhondda line as far as Pontypridd, serving Cathays, Llandaf, Radyr, Taff's Well, Treforest and Pontypridd. It then divides at Abercynon with separate branches to Merthyr and Aberdare up diverging valleys.\n\nThe Merthyr branch serves Quakers Yard, Merthyr Vale, Troed-y-rhiw, Pentre-bach and Merthyr Tydfil. The Welsh Assembly Government confirmed in February 2007 that it is grant funding, in conjunction with European Union Objective 1 assistance, a scheme to upgrade the line north of Abercynon, including reinstatement of 2 miles of double track, to enable the introduction of a half-hourly train service, the revenue costs of which the Welsh Assembly Government will also meet. The enhanced service was said to commence in 2008 but postponed to May 2009.\n\nThe Aberdare branch serves Penrhiwceiber, Mountain Ash, Fernhill, Cwmbach and Aberdare. The line continues beyond Aberdare – for goods purposes only – to serve Tower Colliery, which was the last deep coal mine to remain open in South Wales. Mountain Ash station was redeveloped with a grant from the Welsh Assembly Government in the early part of the decade, the scheme including the provision of a new station and a passing loop to permit an upgrade of the passenger service to two trains per hour from late 2003. There are a few gaps in the half-hourly service to enable coal/stone trains to run to/from Tower Colliery/Hirwaun.\n\nThe line is currently operated by Transport for Wales (TfW) as part of the Valley Lines network.

This was in response to demand from the local Assembly Member. The trial was deemed a success and the extra Sunday services were made permanent from April 2018.\n\nSince its termination at Aberdare following the Beeching Axe, there have been various proposals to extend the line northwards towards Hirwaun again. In recent years, these have been driven by the Welsh Assembly Government.\n\nIn 2006, a study by local transport alliance Sewta appeared to rule out any such extension for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn November 2009, WAG sponsored Network Rail in a feasibility study to reopening both the section to Hirwaun, and parts of the former Anglesey Central Railway between Llangefni on Anglesey, and Bangor.

A light source attracts insects to an electrical grid, where they are electrocuted by touching two wires with a high voltage between them. The name comes from the characteristic onomatopoeic zap sound produced when an insect is electrocuted.\n\nIn its October 1911 issue, \"Popular Mechanics\" magazine had a piece showing a model \"fly trap\" that used all the elements of a modern bug zapper, including electric light and electrified grid. The design was implemented by two unnamed Denver men and was conceded to be too expensive to be of practical use. The device was , contained 5 incandescent light bulbs, and the grid was wires spaced apart with a voltage of 450 volts. Users were supposed to bait the interior with meat.\n\nAccording to the US Patent and Trademark Office, the first bug zapper was patented in 1932 by William M. Frost;\n\nSeparately, Dr. William Brodbeck Herms (1876–1949), a professor of parasitology at the University of California, had been working on large commercial insect traps for over 20 years for protection of California's important fruit industry. In 1934 he introduced the electronic insect killer that became the model for all future bug zappers.\n\nBug zappers are usually housed in a protective cage of plastic or grounded metal bars to prevent people or larger animals from touching the high voltage grid. A light source is fitted inside, often a fluorescent lamp designed to emit both visible and ultraviolet light, which is visible to insects and attracts them.\n\nThe light is surrounded by a pair of interleaved bare wire grids or spirals. The distance between adjacent wires is typically about . A high-voltage power supply powered by mains electricity, which may be a simple transformerless voltage multiplier circuit made with diodes and capacitors, generates a voltage of 2,000 volts or more, high enough to conduct through the body of an insect which bridges the two grids, but not high enough to spark across the air gap. Enough electric current flows through the small body of the insect to heat it to a high temperature. The impedance of the power supply and the arrangement of the grid is such that it cannot drive a dangerous current through the body of a human.\n\nMany bug zappers are fitted with trays that collect the electrocuted insects; other models are designed to allow the debris to fall to the ground below. Some use a fan to help to trap the insect.\n\nThese traps are not effective at killing biting insects (female mosquitoes and other insects), being much more effective at attracting and killing other harmless and beneficial insects. A study by the University of Delaware showed that over a period of 15 summer nights, 13,789 insects were killed among six devices. Of those insects killed, only 31 were biting insects. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide and water vapor in the breath of mammals, not ultraviolet light. However, there are now bug zappers that emit carbon dioxide or use an external bait, such as octenol, to better attract biting insects into the light.\n\nResearch has shown that when insects are electrocuted, bug zappers can spread a mist containing insect parts up to about from the device. The air around the bug zapper can become contaminated by bacteria and viruses that can be inhaled by, or settle on the food of people in the immediate vicinity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that the bug zapper should not be installed above a food preparation area, and that insects should be retained within the device.

This event has generally been understood to mark the founding of colonial Singapore, a break from its status as a port in ancient times during the Srivijaya and Majapahit eras, and later, as part of Melaka and Johor.\n\nA significant port and settlement, known as Temasek, later renamed Singapura, existed on the island of Singapore in the 14th century. Vietnamese records indicate possible diplomatic relationship between Temasek and Vietnam in the 13th century, and Chinese documents describe settlements there in the 14th century. It was likely a vassal state of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese at different times in the 14th century. Around the end of the 14th century, its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca, Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on present-day Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small-scale trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay archipelago was gradually taken over by the Europeancolonial powers, beginning with the Portuguese conquest of the Malacca Sultanate in 1511. In 1613, the Portuguese burnt down a trading settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River, after which Singapore lapsed into insignificance in the history of the region for two hundred years.\n\nThe early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the region's ports. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British, were limited to a relatively minor presence in that period.\n\nSingapore's name comes from 'Singa Pura' which means Lion City in Sanskrit and 'Singam oor' which means city of lions in Tamil. According to the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), a Sumatran prince called Sang Nila Utama landed on Temasek (Singapore's old name) and saw a Lion which is called 'Singa' in Malay. Thus he gave the island a new name, 'Singapura'.\n\nIn 1818, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at Bencoolen. Raffles believed that the British should find a way to challenge the dominance of the Dutch in the area. The trade route between China and British India passed through the Malacca Strait, and with the growing trade with China, that route would become increasingly important. However, the Dutch had tight control over the trade in the region and intended to enforce the exclusive rights of its company ships to trade, and that trade should be conducted at its entrepot Batavia. British trading ships were heavily taxed at Dutch ports, stifling British trade in the region.\n\nRaffles reasoned that the way to challenge the Dutch was to establish a new port in the region. Existing British ports were not in a strategic enough position to becoming major trading centres. Penang was too far north of the southern narrow part of Straits of Malacca controlled by the Dutch, whereas Bencoolen faced the Indian Ocean near the Sunda Strait, a much less important area as it is too far away from the main trading route. Many other possible sites were either controlled by the Dutch, or had other problems.\n\nIn 1818, Raffles managed to convince Lord Hastings, the then governor-general of India and his superior in the British East India Company, to fund an expedition to establish a new British base in the region, but with the proviso that it should not antagonise the Dutch. Raffles then searched for several weeks. He found several islands that seemed promising, but were either already occupied by the Dutch, or lacked a suitable harbour.\n\nEventually Raffles settled on the island of Singapore, because of its position at the southern tip of the Malay peninsula, near the Straits of Malacca, and its excellent natural harbor, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing ships. Most importantly, it was unoccupied by the Dutch.\n\nRaffles' expedition arrived in Singapore on 29 January 1819 (although they landed on Saint John's Island the previous day). He found a Malay settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River, headed by Temenggong Abdul Rahman for the Sultan of Johor. The Temenggong had originally moved to Singapore from Johor in 1811 with a group of Malays, and when Raffles arrived, there were an estimated 150 people governed by the Temenggong, mostly of them Malays, with around 30 Chinese. Although the island was nominally ruled by Johor, the political situation was precarious for the Sultan of Johor at the time. The incumbent Sultan of Johor, Tengku Abdul Rahman, was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis, and would never agree to a British base in Singapore. However, Abdul Rahman was Sultan only because his older brother, Tengku Hussein, also known as Tengku Long, had been away in Pahang getting married when their father died. Hussein was then living in exile in the Riau Islands.\n\nWith the Temenggong's help, Raffles smuggled Tengku Hussein to Singapore. He offered to recognize Hussein as the rightful Sultan of Johor, and provide him with a yearly payment; in return, Hussein would grant the British East India Company the right to establish a trading post on Singapore. In the agreement, Sultan Husain would receive a yearly sum of 5,000 Spanish dollars, with the Temenggong receiving a yearly sum of 3,000 Spanish dollars. This agreement was ratified with a formal treaty signed on 6 February 1819.\n\nRaffles returned to British Bencoolen (Sumatra) the day after the signing of the treaty, leaving Major William Farquhar as the Resident and Commandant of the new settlement, supported initially by some artillery and a single regiment of Indian soldiers. Establishing a trading port from scratch was in itself a daunting prospect, but Farquhar's administration was, in addition, practically unfunded, as Raffles did not wish his superiors to view Singapore as a liability. In addition, it was forbidden from earning revenue by imposing port duties, Raffles having decided from the outset that Singapore would be a free port.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, the new colony rapidly proved to be a spectacular success. As news of the free port spread across the archipelago, Bugis, Peranakan Chinese, and Arab traders flocked to the island, seeking to circumvent the Dutch trading restrictions. During the first year of operation, $400,000 (Spanish dollars) worth of trade passed through Singapore. It has been estimated that when Raffles arrived in 1819, the total population of the whole of Singapore was around a thousand, mostly of various local tribes. By 1821, the island's population had increased to around five thousand, and the trade volume was $8 million. By 1825, the population had passed the ten thousand mark, with a trade volume of $22 million. (By comparison, the trade volume for the long-established port of Penang was $8.5 million during the same year.)\n\nRaffles returned to Singapore in 1822. Although Farquhar had successfully led the settlement through its difficult early years, Raffles was critical of many of the decisions he had made. For instance, in order to generate much-needed revenue for the government, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for gambling and the sale of opium, which Raffles saw as social evils. Raffles was also appalled by the slave trade tolerated by Farquhar. Raffles arranged for the dismissal of Farquhar, who was replaced by John Crawfurd. Raffles took over the administration himself, and set about drafting a set of new policies for the settlement.\n\nRaffles banned slavery, closed all gambling dens, prohibited the carrying of weapons, and imposed heavy taxation to discourage what he considered vices such as drunkenness and opium smoking. Raffles, dismayed at the disarray of the colony, also arranged to organise Singapore into functional and ethnic subdivisions under the drafted Raffles Plan of Singapore. Today, the remnants of this organisation like the Raffles Town Plan can be found in the ethnic neighbourhoods, within public housing estates or various places across Singapore.\n\nFurther agreements of the Malay chiefs would gradually erode their influence and control over Singapore. In December 1822, the Malay chiefs' claim to Singapore's revenue was changed to a monthly payment. On 7 June 1823, Raffles arranged for another agreement with the Sultan and Temenggong to buy out their judicial power and rights to the lands except for the areas reserved for the Sultan and Temenggong. They would give up their rights to numerous functions on the island, including the collection of port taxes, in return for lifelong monthly payments of $1500 and $800 respectively. This agreement brought the island squarely under British law, with the proviso that it would take into account Malay customs, traditions and religious practices, \"where they shall not be contrary to reason, justice or humanity.\"\n\nA further treaty, the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, was arranged by the second Resident John Crawford with the Malay chiefs and signed on 2 August 1824 to replace the Singapore Treaty. Singapore, including its nearby islands, was officially fully ceded to the East India Company, and in return, the chiefs would have their debts cancelled and receive an allowance for life, with each given an additional lump sum of 20,000 Spanish dollars.\n\nAfter installing John Crawford, an efficient and frugal administrator, as the new governor, Raffles departed for Britain in October 1823. He would never return to Singapore. Most of his personal possessions were lost after his ship, the \"Fame\", caught fire and sank, and he died only a few years later, in 1826, at the age of 44.\n\nThe status of Singapore as a British possession was cemented by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, which carved up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers. The area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Penang, Malacca, and Singapore, was designated as the British sphere of influence, while the area south of the Straits was assigned to the Dutch.\n\nThis division had far-reaching consequences for the region: modern-day Malaysia and Singapore correspond to the British area established in the treaty, and modern-day Indonesia to the Dutch. In 1826, Singapore was grouped together with Penang and Malacca into a single administrative unit, the Straits Settlements, under the British East India Company.\n\n"}
{"id": "2047802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047802", "title": "King of the Hill (The Simpsons)", "text": "King of the Hill (The Simpsons)\n\n\"King of the Hill\" is the twenty-third episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 3, 1998. It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Steven Dean Moore, and guest stars Brendan Fraser and Steven Weber. The episode sees Homer trying to climb a large mountain to impress Bart after he humiliates him at a church picnic with his lack of fitness.\n\nAfter his obesity embarrasses Bart at a church picnic, Homer attempts to lose weight, and begins going on midnight jogs around town. He soon discovers \"Power Sauce\", an energy bar made out of apples which he starts to eat regularly.\n\nAt a gym, Homer meets Rainier Wolfcastle who becomes his fitness coach. In two months, Homer is healthier, more muscular, and reveals what he has been doing to his family. At the gym, two \"Power Sauce\" representatives ask Rainier to climb to the top of Springfield's tallest mountain, \"The Murderhorn\", as a publicity stunt. When he refuses, Bart insists Homer do it.\n\nDespite Grampa telling him about how he was betrayed by a friend, C. W. McAllister, during their climb on the Murderhorn, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them secretly dragging him up. Once the \"Power Sauce\" representatives get wind of the situation, they unsuccessfully attempt to warn Homer not to continue with the dangerous stunt, revealing that the bar is actually made up of apple cores and Chinese newspapers.\n\nThe mountain proves too treacherous and high for Homer, who takes shelter in a cave. In it, he finds McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Grampa who betrayed him. Too tired and ashamed to continue, Homer sticks his flag pole on the ledge, ripping off the \"Power Sauce\" flag and tying his own make-shift white flag to the pole. The ensuing crack collapses the rest of the mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is greeted by the crowd. When he goes to show the family, they find out that the flag has disappeared from the pole. Nevetheless, Bart is proud of his father for making it to the top of the mountain.\n\nThe episode was pitched and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff had to find a new angle for Homer's weight problems, as the idea had been used several times before. This was emphasized in this episode when Marge does not seem to care that Homer is going to try to lose weight again.\n\nIn the scenes where the Sherpas were speaking, the show staff went to great lengths to find translations. Originally, the producers of the film adaption of the book \"Into Thin Air\" were contacted to help. The film producers were shocked at the trouble the \"Simpsons\" staff were going to, and replied that they had simply made up translations in the film. The staff then had to consult various experts by telephone.\n\nThe idea of the upper part of the mountain collapsing so Homer would be at the peak came from Mike Scully's brother Brian, after the staff \"desperately needed a way out\".\n\nThe mountain Homer must climb, the Murderhorn, is a reference to the mountain Matterhorn, which is located in the Swiss Alps. The name of the episode is a reference to the Fox series \"King of The Hill\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"King of the Hill\" finished 23rd in ratings for the week of April 27–May 4, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.4, equivalent to approximately 9.2 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"King of the Hill\", and \"Ally McBeal\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, stating: \"A quite charming little adventure in which, in an effort to impress Bart, Homer undertakes a dangerous adventure and comes through successfully. It's nice because just for once, to all intents and purposes, Homer actually succeeds in something.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2047817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047817", "title": "Sewer gas", "text": "Sewer gas\n\nSewer gas is a complex mixture of toxic and nontoxic gases produced and collected in sewage systems by the decomposition of organic household or industrial wastes, typical components of sewage.\n\nSewer gases may include hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, esters, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Improper disposal of petroleum products such as gasoline and mineral spirits contribute to sewer gas hazards. Sewer gases are of concern due to their odor, health effects, and potential for creating fire or explosions.\n\nSewer gas is typically restricted from entering buildings through plumbing traps that create a water seal at potential points of entry. In addition, plumbing vents allow sewer gases to be exhausted outdoors. Infrequently used plumbing fixtures may allow sewer gas to enter a home due to evaporation of water in the trap, especially in warm weather. The result is the most common means of sewer gas entering buildings and can be solved easily by using the fixtures regularly or adding water to their drains. One of the most common traps to dry out are floor drains such as those typically placed near home furnaces, water heaters and rooms with underfloor heating. Infrequently used utility sinks, tubs, showers, and restrooms also are common culprits. Trap primers are available that automatically add water to remote or little used traps such as these. Blocked plumbing vents, typically at the roof, also can cause water seals to fail via siphoning of the water.\n\nExposure to sewer gas also can happen if the gas seeps in via a leaking plumbing drain or vent pipe, or even through cracks in a building’s foundation. Sewer gas is typically denser than atmospheric gases and may accumulate in basements, but may eventually mix with surrounding air. Individuals who work in sanitation industries or on farms might be exposed on the job if they clean or maintain municipal sewers, manure storage tanks, or septic tanks.\n\nIn buildings with HVAC air handlers that admit outside air for ventilation, plumbing vents placed too closely to air intakes or windows can be a source of sewer gas odors. In some cases airflow around buildings and wind effects may contribute to sewer gas odor problems even with appropriately separated vents and air intakes. Increasing vent heights, adding vent pipe filters, or providing powered dilution and exhaust can help reduce occurrences.\n\nDuring the mid-1800s, when indoor plumbing was being developed, it was a common idea that disease was caused largely by miasmas, or literally \"polluted air.\" (Malaria, a disease spread by mosquitoes that breed in marshy areas, got its name from the Italian words for \"bad air\" because people initially blamed it on marsh gas.) Originally, traps in plumbing drain pipes were designed to help keep this bad air from passing back into living spaces within buildings. However, during the Broad Street cholera outbreak in London, in the Summer of 1854, physician John Snow, among others, worked to prove that polluted water was the culprit, not the foul smells from sewage pipes. Subsequently, even as the germ theory of disease developed, society was slow to accept the idea that odors from sewers were relatively harmless when it came to the spread of disease.\n\nIn most homes, sewer gas may have a slightly unpleasant odor, but does not often pose a significant health hazard. Residential sewer pipes primarily contain the gases found in air (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.). Often, methane is the gas of next highest concentration, but typically remains at nontoxic levels, especially in properly vented systems. However, if sewer gas has a distinct “rotten egg” smell, especially in sewage mains, septic tanks, or other sewage treatment facilities, it may be due to hydrogen sulfide content, which can be detected by human olfactory senses in concentrations as low as parts per billion. Exposure to low levels of this chemical can irritate the eyes, cause a cough or sore throat, shortness of breath, and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Prolonged low-level exposure may cause fatigue, pneumonia, loss of appetite, headaches, irritability, poor memory, and dizziness. High concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (>150 ppm) can produce olfactory fatigue, whereby the scent becomes undetectable. At higher concentrations (>300 ppm), hydrogen sulfide can cause loss of consciousness and death. Very high concentrations (>1000 ppm) can result in immediate collapse, occurring after a single breath.\n\nSewer gas can contain methane and hydrogen sulfide, both highly flammable and potentially explosive substances. As such, ignition of the gas is possible with flame or sparks.\nThe methane concentration in open sewers is lower (7 to 15 ppmv) than the closed drains (up to 300 ppmv) in samples collected 2 cm above the level of sewage.\n\nFully vented sewer gases contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Septic vent pipes can be fitted with filters that remove some odors.\n\nSewer gas can be used as a power source, thus reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The gas is piped into a cleaning system and then used as a fuel to power a generator or combined heat and power (CHP) plant.\n\nGases present in sewerage can strongly impact material\ndurability due to the action of microorganisms. The most deleterious one is associated to hydrogen sulfide that can result in biogenic sulfide corrosion or microbial corrosion. In worst cases, it may lead to the collapse of the structure with significant cost for its rehabilitation.\n\n"}

The club competes in the Super League, and plays at Xanthi FC Arena.\n\nFounded in 1967, Xanthi is well set up in terms of their financial support and youth setup. Xanthi participated in the UEFA Cup / Europa League in 2001–02, 2005–06, 2006–07 and 2013–14 seasons. In the 2004–05 season, Xanthi finished fourth in the Alpha Ethinki (first division, today Super League), the club's all-time best performance.\n\nXanthi's first appearance in the first division was in 1989, and the club has been taking part continuously since then.\n\nThe club was formed in 1967 from the merger of two local clubs: Aspida Xanthi, who was founded in 1922 and was the club of the most popular layers of the region. The \"blues\" in 1961 had become champions in the Northern League of Beta Ethniki, losing the accession from Panelefsiniakos in the barrage game) and Orfeas Xanthi, who was founded in 1903 and was the bourgeoisie of the city. From 1957 to 1964, Orfeas competed in the Northern Group of the Beta Ethniki (which held in 3 groups). The derby of the two teams was the most characteristic, with the city divided into two in each encounter.\n\nIn June 1967, with the Greek military junta in government, the movements in Xanthi were also made to create a team that would unite the dynamics of the two clubs, while the national championships were reorganized. The strengthening of the region in sport at that time had also taken place in other parts of the country and at the same time AO Xanthi (among other clubs) participated directly in the single second national category. Not long ago, from 1967 until 1985, the club remained in the Beta Ethniki, with all the restructuring that had suffered the class and benefited in the early years. The difficulties were great, the revenues were few, but Xanthi's stadium was always filled. The yellow and black beads of Orfeas Xanthi and the shades of Aspida Xanthi, have brought the red of AO Xanthi, which has joined and united the city for many years. Those years were different, difficult, but \"sweet\". Without the abundance of images, the imagination was rampant, transforming footballers into \"holy monsters\" of the sport. Something that apply for all teams.\n18 years stays Xanthi Football Club on the stadiums of the Beta Ethniki. In this timeframe, the club generally completed the racing season under the 10th place of the scoreboard, while only in 1969–70 they had reached the 7th and the 1974–75 season in the 9th place. When they started to show how they were preparing for the jump in the top division, the 1982–83 season ended 5th, the next 4th and the 1984–85 season which was ambitious for something bigger, they were downgraded.\n\nIn 1985–86, with this new administration of Mr. Kokkalas, Xanthi was reformed and returned stronger. First title in the Gamma Ethniki in 1985–86, followed by another three seasons in the Beta Ethniki until the big dream came true. From the 8th and 11th places of '87 and '88 respectively, in the summer of 1989 the city and the club lived unforgettable moments by conquering the title of the Beta Ethniki and at the same time the historic rise in the big lounges. In one year, Xanthi had first goal scorer Achilleas Adamopoulos with 30 goals.\n\nThe specificity of the city of Xanthi and the club's also is that the overwhelming majority over the years and many of the following that followed, in the club's team were also Muslim footballers in the region. Xanthi proved and demonstrates in practice also in sports that diversity can unite by sending its own message.\n\nThe first experiences in the Alpha Ethniki were unique, difficult and unforgettable. With enthusiasm, passion and a \"hot\" atmosphere at the stadium, the basic goal of staying in the early years was achieved with a lot of stress. Mr Kokkala's administration first brought foreign footballers, with the Brazilians Marcelo Veridiano and Sandro making the start and following others. Especially Marcelo, he has a special place in the heart of the fans, as he still continues to be the top scorer of the club. Despite the anxiety and the end result justifying the efforts, Xanthi remained until October 1991 in the Alpha Ethniki and with the same profile.\n\nIn the chairmanship of Theodoros Kokkalas, Xanthi had already managed to win two championships in the Gamma and Beta Ethniki, the rise and the renewal of the team stay for two consecutive season in the top division, the Alpha Ethniki. But the top achievement of then Xanthi's administration was to find the ideal choice for the next day of the team, the city and the wider area in the football world. Even randomly, as the original agreement was a sponsorship of Skoda vehicles company in Greece for which the responsible importer in Greece was the company Viamar S.A. by Christos Panopoulos. Everything was done very quickly, but not too quickly, and timing was such a legal one that allowed the clubs to have a \"sign\" sponsor in their original name. That's how Xanthi was renamed \"Skoda Xanthi\". The signatures that fell on 10 October 1991 between Kokkalas and Panopoulos at Ledra Marriott hotel in Athens, really took off the shares of the club and kept alive, in time, the names of all those who had been abused for the club.\n\nThe modern history of Xanthi brings broadly the signature of the great shareholder of the club, Christos Panopoulos, who is already the most long-lasting owner in Greek football, keeping the club to the same high standards that he has set since his first days at the leading peak of Xanthi, as he is called since 2016, when the cooperation with Skoda was ended and the club's name returned to its original.\n\nAlso, while several companies perceive marketing as a feature of impressions, Xanthi has been successful since Christos Panopoulos took over this business. In 1991, Xanthi giving its solutions in the economic field and at the same time becoming a rising-initially-and constant force afterwards. They were the first club that established for many years in the 1990s the award of its best Player of the Year, with a donation of a sponsor car. It was the first provincial club that in 1994 had organized an international tournament at the Xanthi Ground with the participation of Coventry City, Portsmouth and AEK Athens. That same year he had brought coach Howard Kendall, who a few months earlier was a coach in Everton.\nIn 2005, the world's top football player, Pelé, launched its sports center and its new stadium Xanthi FC Arena, giving the world glamor to the event. At the same year, on 7 July, Xanthi announced one of the biggest transfers in its history, the Brazilian defensive midfielder Emerson.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, Xanthi has changed its name without including \"Skoda\".\n\nXanthi has been established in the consciousness of all the fancy public, ending many times higher than all the other provincial clubs. Having reached the final of the Greek Cup in 2015 and in the championship has ended in all the positions except for the relegation. In 2015, Xanthi coached by Răzvan Lucescu lost the trophy from Olympiacos with 3–1.\n\nIn the early years, the team's emblem consisted exclusively of Democritus. A new emblem with small changes was introduced in 1985. The emblem was retained in this form until 1991 when elements of VIAMAR SA, a new owner of the club, were added. In 1996, Skoda's brand was added. A further change in the emblem took place in 2001, with the addition of the soccer ball, while in 2007 a different version of the particular emblem was presented. In 2012 a new emblem was presented, in which the bust of Democritus was now in the middle.\n\nThe year 2016 is a new reference point in the history of Xanthi. Many and radical changes to issues that were not racing. At the end of the 2015–16 season, and more specifically from 1 June 2016, Skoda Xanthi SA returned to its roots and is now called AO Xanthi Football Club. The cooperation of the \"mother\" of the football club VIAMAR SA ended with the well-known automotive industry and therefore the association that has linked its name for 25 consecutive years with its sponsor, goes back with its own forces and of course, under the auspices of VIAMAR, the company of the major shareholder Mr. Christos Panopoulos.\nThis has led to many changes. From the name and logo, to the field and the philosophy.\n\nThe yellow and black kits of Orfeas and the shades of Aspida, have brought the red of AO Xanthi, which has joined and united the city for many years.\n\nXanthi left their old stadium, the Xanthi Ground (capacity 9,500), located near the centre of the city, for the Xanthi FC Arena in 2004. Their new stadium sited 8 km outside the city, near Pigadia village, has a capacity of 7,244, however has only 3 stands. When the final stand is finally built, the new capacity will be around 9,000 seats. The stadium is located in the same place as the sports center of the Thracian Club, a real jewel for Greek football. The sports center includes, among other things, seven stadiums, as well as the hotel \"Le Chalet\". The construction of the stadium itself, costing €6,500,000.\n\nThe first game at the Xanthi FC Arena took place on 18 September 2004, with the team of Xanthi being imposed 3–1 on Aris for the 1st match of Alpha Ethniki Championship for the 2004–05 season.\n\nThe stadium was officially inaugurated by the Brazilian legend Pelé on 12 May 2005.\n\nOn 16 January 2005, and before the game with Ionian a fan of Xanthi, Stamatis Georgoudakis lost his life. Since then the Gate B-C has been named after the stadium. The ticket record was played with Panathinaikos on 20 January 2007 with 6,642 spectators. In the summer of 2016, the stadium was renamed \"Xanthi FC Arena\".\n\nRight next to Xanthi FC Arena, there is the club's athletic center, which, in addition to the two courts, has all the necessary spaces for coaches, players and staff to work on their field. In a huge area almost adjacent to the stadium, it is located in the sports center of Xanthi, with the \"despotic\" presence of the hotel Le Chalet. A hotel that after its complete destruction on 7 March 2003 by fire, was not the few who supported, that Christos Panopoulos would leave everything and would be away from the team and generally from football. This has not been done, and to this day, Le Chalet overlooking the 7 football fields, the pool, the pool bar, the basketball court, the tennis court and the changing rooms, has all the specifications for an excellent sporting preparation. For the team of Xanthi and all the departments of its Academy and many other clubs that have preferred the athletic center of Xanthi to preparation before the start of the season. In 2017, it was also characteristic that the coach of Greece, Michael Skibbe, in one of his first statements as a federal coach, referring to the sports center of Xanthi with the best words.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nBest position in bold.\n\nKey: 2R = Second Round, 3R = Third Round, 4R = Fourth Round, 5R = Fifth Round, GS = Group Stage, R16 = Round of 16, QF = Quarter-finals, SF = Semi-finals.\n\n\nCo-trainer\n\nDirector of Sport\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2047871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047871", "title": "Atlanta Crackers", "text": "Atlanta Crackers\n\nThe Atlanta Crackers were Minor League Baseball teams based in Atlanta, Georgia, between 1901 and 1965. The Crackers were Atlanta's home team until the Atlanta Braves moved from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1966.\n\nAtlanta played its first Southern Association game (against the Nashville Baseball Club) on Saturday, April 26, 1902 (Memorial Day) in Piedmont Park before a crowd of around 3,500. For 60 years (until 1961), the Crackers were part of the Class AA Southern Association, a period during which they won more games than any other Association team, earning the nickname the \"Yankees of the Minors\". In 1962, the Association disbanded. Then, the former Miami Marlins, a Class AAA International League team that had spent 1961 playing in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Charleston, West Virginia, moved to Atlanta and adopted the Crackers name. The franchise was relocated to Richmond, Virginia, as the Richmond Braves after the arrival of the Atlanta Braves in 1966.\n\nThe Crackers played in Ponce de Leon Park from 1907 until a fire on September 9, 1923, destroyed the all-wood stadium. Spiller Field (a stadium later also called Ponce de Leon Park), became their home starting in the 1924 season; it was named in honor of a wealthy businessman who paid for the new concrete-and-steel stadium. That new park was unusual because it was constructed around a magnolia tree that became part of center field. Balls landing in the tree remained in play, until Earl Mann took over the team in 1947 and had the outfield wall moved in about fifty feet. The Crackers played their last season in the newly built Atlanta Stadium (later known as Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium) in 1965.\n\nThe Crackers were independent of major league farm systems until 1950. They then became a AA affiliate of the Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves (1950–58) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1959–61) during the last decade of the Southern Association's existence. As an International League team, they were the top affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals (1962–63), Minnesota Twins (1964) and the Braves again (1965).\n\nAccording to Tim Darnell, who wrote \"The Crackers: Early Days of Atlanta Baseball\", the origins of the team name is unknown.\n\nDarnell cites several possibilities as to why this name was chosen:\n\nHowever, this list does not represent the most likely origins of the name. The term \"cracker\" is derived from the Gaelic \"craic\", meaning entertaining conversation or boasting, with the latter sense still attested in the idiom \"not all it's cracked up to be.\" It was used in the 18th century to denote Irish and Scottish colonists of the Deep South backcountry. The Earl of Dartmouth had this to say in a 1766 correspondence: \"I should explain to your Lordship what is meant by Crackers; a name they have got from being great boasters; they are a lawless set of rascals on the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia, who often change their places of abode.\"\n\nDuring the period of Reconstruction following the American Civil War, there was also a political party of the same name. Organized in Augusta, Georgia, this party's platform was one of \"opposition to Catholics and segregation of blacks\".\n\nWhile now sometimes used as a derogatory term for a white southerner that promotes racism, it is also used as a term of pride by some white southerners to indicate one that is descended from those original settlers of the area.\n\nAs in several other cities, Atlanta's local Negro league team was named after the local White league team: the Atlanta Black Crackers joined the Negro Southern League in 1920, and existed until the early 1950s.\n\n\nPlay-by-play announcer Ernie Harwell called Cracker games on the radio from 1943 to 1949 before being traded to Brooklyn Dodgers for catcher Cliff Dapper, the only time an announcer has been traded for a player.\n\n"}
{"id": "2047880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047880", "title": "Constitution of Bangladesh", "text": "Constitution of Bangladesh\n\nThe Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is the constitutional document of Bangladesh. It was adopted on 4 November 1972 and effective from 16 December 1972. It provides the framework of the Bangladeshi republic with a parliamentary government, fundamental human rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary, democratic local government and a national bureaucracy. The constitution includes references to socialism, Islam, secular democracy and the Bengali language. It commits Bangladesh to “contribute to international peace and co-operation in keeping with the progressive aspirations of mankind”. The constitution has several controversial elements like Article 70.\n\nJudicial precedent is enshrined in Bangladesh's constitution under Article 111, which makes Bangladesh an integral part of the common law world. Judicial review is also supported by the constitution.\n\nThe advent of British rule in the 18th century displaced the centuries of governance developed by South Asian empires. The Regulating Act of 1773 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom was the first basic law in the Bengal Presidency. The British Empire did not grant universal suffrage and democratic institutions to its colonies. The British slowly granted concessions for home rule. The Government of India Act 1858, Indian Councils Act 1861, Indian Councils Act 1892 and Indian Councils Act 1909 were later important laws of government. The legislatures of British India included the Bengal Legislative Council and the Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council in the early 20th century. The Nehru Report recommended for universal suffrage, a bi-cameral legislature, a senate and a house of representatives. The Fourteen Points of Jinnah demanded provincial autonomy and quotas for Muslims in government. The Government of India Act 1935 established provincial parliaments based on separate electorates.\n\nThe 1940 Lahore Resolution, supported by the first Prime Minister of Bengal, asked the British government that \"the North Western and Eastern Zones of (British) India should be grouped to constitute ‘independent states’\". It further proclaimed \"that adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards should be specifically provided in the constitution for minorities in these units and in the regions for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights\". The resolution's status is akin to the magna carta in Bangladesh and Pakistan, in terms of the concept of independence. On 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the partition of Bengal. It was decided by 120 votes to 90 that, if Bengal remained united, it should join the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. At a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal, it was decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the Constituent Assembly of India. At another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that Bengal should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan if Bengal was partitioned. On 6 July 1947, the Sylhet referendum voted to partition Sylhet Division from Assam Province and merge it into East Bengal. On 11 August 1947, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the president of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, declared that religious minorities would enjoy full freedom of religion in the emergent new state.\n\nSection 8 of the Indian Independence Act 1947 provided that the Government of India Act, 1935 with certain amendments and adaptations would be the working constitution of the Dominion of Pakistan during the transitional period. The Constituent Assembly of Pakistan included 79 members, of whom 44 were from East Bengal, 22 from West Punjab, 5 from Sind, 3 from the North West Frontier Province, 1 from Baluchistan and 4 from the acceding princely states. The Bengali Language Movement and demands for replacing separate electorates with joint universal suffrage were key issues in East Bengal. The first constituent assembly was arbitrarily dissolved by the Governor General in 1954. This led to the court challenge of \"Federation of Pakistan v. Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan\", in which the federal court supported the Governor General's decision, although Justice A. R. Cornelius expressed dissent. The dissolution of the assembly was one of the first major blows to democracy in Pakistan.\n\nThe Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 was adopted by a second constituent assembly elected in 1955. It declared two provinces- East Pakistan and West Pakistan; and two federal languages- Urdu and Bengali. The first Pakistani constitution was in place for only a few years. General Ayub Khan staged a military coup and introduced the Constitution of Pakistan of 1962. The 1962 constitution introduced a presidential system in which electoral colleges would be responsible for electing the president and governors. The chief ministers' offices were abolished; and parliament and provincial assemblies were delegated to a mainly advisory role. The system was dubbed \"Basic Democracy\". In 1965, Fatima Jinnah's failed bid for the presidency prompted allegations of a rigged electoral system. The Six Points of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman demanded parliamentary democracy. Rahman's Six Points were part of the manifesto of the Awami League, the party which won first general election in East and West Pakistan in 1970. The Awami League ran on the platform of developing a new Pakistani constitution based on the Six Points. The League won 167 out 169 East Pakistani seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan and 288 out of 300 seats in the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. The refusal of Pakistan's military junta to transfer power to Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman triggered the Bangladesh War of Independence.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Bangladesh issued the Proclamation of Independence on 10 April 1971, which served as the interim first constitution of Bangladesh. It declared “equality, human dignity and social justice” as the fundamental principles of the republic. East Pakistani members of Pakistan's federal and provincial assemblies were transformed into members of the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh. The constituent assembly had 404 members. After the war, the Constitution Drafting Committee was formed in 1972. The committee included 34 members with Dr. Kamal Hossain as its chairman.\n\nThe Constitution Bill was introduced in the Assembly on 12 October. Its first reading began on 19 October and continued till 30 October. The second reading took place from 31 October to 3 November. Manabendra Narayan Larma made an impassioned appeal to declare the term of citizenship as “Bangladeshi” instead of “Bengali”. Larma argued that labeling all citizens as Bengali discriminated against non-Bengali communities, including his own Chakma ethnic group.\n\nThe third reading began on 4 November and it approved 65 amendments to the Constitution Bill and adopted and enacted the Constitution on 4 November. The Constitution came into effect on 16 December 1972. A Westminster style political system was established. It declared nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism as the fundamental principles of the republic. It proclaimed fundamental human rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, the right to education and public healthcare among others. A two thirds vote of parliament was required to amend the constitution.\n\nAfter winning the 1973 general election, the Awami League government often flouted constitutional rules and principles. The government received strong criticism from the Bangladeshi press, including both Bengali and English newspapers. The Committee for Civil Liberties and Legal Aid was formed to defend the constitution. The Awami League enacted three constitutional amendments between 1973 and 1975. The most drastic amendment was in January 1975. It introduced a one party state and a presidential government, while the judiciary's independence was greatly curtailed.\n\nConstitutional rule was suspended on 15 August 1975 with the assassination of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the declaration of martial law. The Chief Martial Law Administrator issued a series of Proclamation Orders between 1975 and 1979 which amended the constitution. Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman is credited for many of these Proclamation Orders. The most significant of these orders was defining citizenship as Bangladeshi; other orders included the insertion of religious references and the controversial Indemnity Ordinance. In 1979, martial law was lifted, multiparty politics was restored and constitutional rule was revived. The Fifth Amendment in 1979 validated all Proclamation Orders of the martial law authorities. An executive presidency continued until 1982.\n\nMartial law was again imposed in the 1982 Bangladesh coup d'état. When constitutional rule was restored in 1986, the Sixth Amendment validated previous Proclamation Orders issued by the Chief Martial Law Administrator. The Eighth Amendment in 1988 declared Islam as the state religion and initiated limited devolution of the judiciary.\n\nIn 1990, a pro-democracy uprising ousted President Ershad. The uprising was followed by parliamentary elections in 1991. The Twelfth Amendment passed by the fifth parliament is the most influential constitutional amendment in Bangladesh. It re-established parliamentary government. It amended Articles 48, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 70, 72, 109, 119, 124, 141A and 142. The Prime Minister became the executive head of government, and along with the cabinet, was responsible to parliament. Local government was made more democratic. However, the amendment restricted the voting freedom of MPs. According to Article 70, MPs would lose their seat if they voted against their party. This made it impossible for parliament to have a free vote, including no-confidence motions to remove a prime minister. Experts have described the amendment as instituting prime ministerial dictatorship. The Thirteen Amendment in 1996 introduced the Caretaker government of Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2010, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruled that the Fifth Amendment of 1979 went against the constitutional spirit of the country and hence invalidated its removal of clauses related to secularism. The Supreme Court gave the verdict in the case of \"Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd. v. Government of Bangladesh\". While implementing the supreme court's verdict in the Fifteenth Amendment in 2011, the Awami League-led parliament abolished the caretaker government system, which the party itself had advocated in 1996.\n\nIn 2017, the Supreme Court declared the Sixteenth Amendment Act of 2014 illegal and void. The amendment had introduced the provision of impeaching judges in parliament. The Supreme Court held that parliament cannot have conscience votes due to Article 70.\n\nWe, the people of Bangladesh, having proclaimed our independence on the 26th day of March, 1971 and through a historic struggle for national liberation, established the independent, sovereign People's Republic of Bangladesh;\n\nPledging that the high ideals of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our brave martyrs to sacrifice their lives in, the national liberation struggle, shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution;\n\nFurther pledging that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens;\n\nAffirming that it is our sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace and co operation in keeping with the progressive aspirations of mankind;\n\n\nThere are two references to Islam to in the introduction and Part I of the constitution. The document begins with the Islamic phrase بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ which is translated as “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful”. Article 2A declares that Islam is the state religion of the republic.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stated that Bangladesh will be governed in line with the spirit of the Constitution of Medina.\n\nFreedom of religion is one of the cornerstones of Bangladesh's constitution. Article 12 calls for secularity, the elimination of interfaith tensions and prohibits the abuse of religion for political purposes and any discrimination against, or persecution of, persons practicing a particular religion. Article 41 subjects religious freedom to public order, law and morality; it gives every citizen the right to profess, practice or propagate any religion; every religious community or denomination the right to establish, maintain and manage its religious institutions; and states that no person attending any educational institution shall be required to receive religious instruction, or to take part in or to attend any religious ceremony or worship, if that instruction, ceremony or worship relates to a religion other than his own. Governments have generally supported and respected religious freedom.\n\nAs of 2017, Bangladesh is a state party to the following international treaties concerning human rights. Bangladesh can in theory be held liable for its performance in the fields of these treaties. \nAmong the notable agreements Bangladesh is not a state party to include the following.\n\nArticle 111 of the constitution proclaims the doctrine of binding judicial precedent. According to the article, the law declared by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, including its Appellate Division and the High Court Division, are binding in all subordinate courts.\n\nThe constitution does not specifically mention the term judicial review, but Article 102 allows writ petitions to be filed at the High Court Division for reviewing laws, the actions and policies of authories and lower court proceedings. Articles 7(2), 26, 44(1) & 102 are considered to indirectly support the system of judicial review.\n\n\nDespite constitutional guarantees of fundamental human rights, Bangladesh's government and security forces are accused of many human rights abuses.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, the government of Bangladesh has sought to trample its citizens' right to free speech on the internet through the Information and Communications Technology Act. The law can be argued to be in violation of Article 39 of the constitution. The Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act which imposed the government's restrictions over the work of non governmental organizations. The law has also been argued to be against the spirit of the constitution.\n\nIn 2017, Radio Sweden ran an investigative report which alleged torture and secret killings by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). RAB has been described by Human Rights Watch as a \"death squad\". Torture and other ill-treatment in custody was widespread; however, complaints were rarely investigated. The 2013 Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act was poorly enforced due to a lack of political will and awareness among law enforcement agencies. Human rights groups accused several security force branches – including police and the Rapid Action Battalion – of torture and other ill-treatment. Torture was carried out to extract “confessions”, for extortion or to punish political opponents of the government.\n\nThese activities of Bangladeshi security forces contravenes Article 32 of the constitution which concerns the right to life and personal liberty.\n\nThe government is yet to fully implement the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord. There have been legal challenges which question the accord's place in the unitary structure of the Bangladeshi state. Regional political parties have demanded constitutional recognition for the indigenous people of the region.\n\nDr. Kamal Hossain, who is described as the “father of the Bangladeshi constitution”, has been an ardent supporter of reforming the document to reflect the values of the 21st century. Hossain has blamed amendments during military rule for eroding the constitution's principles. Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman, a former Chief Justice and interim prime minister, proposed that a Constitution Commission be formed to explore the prospects for constitutional reform.\n\nA. T. M. Shamsul Huda, a former Chief Election Commissioner, has called for a constitutional amendment to ensure \"checks and balances\" and the separation of powers.\n\nProfessor Anwar Hossain, a leading Bangladeshi historian, has called for the term “People’s Republic of Bangladesh” to be changed to the “Republic of Bangladesh”.\n\nBarrister Nazmul Huda, a politician and former cabinet minister, has proposed that a new constitution be drafted after the election of a new constituent assembly. One criticism of the document stems from the fact that it was drafted by a constituent assembly dominated by the left-wing Awami League and lacked representation from most other political groups. The League has governed Bangladesh for 18 years in its 45-year history as of 2017.\n\n, the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh has been amended 17 times.\n\nBangladesh has a single codified document as its constitution, as in the United States, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Germany and France. It is not an unwritten constitution or a set of constitutional statutes, as in Britain, Israel, Canada, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\n\n\n"}

In the Reds' best year with Critz on the team, 1926, they finished second in the league two games behind the champion St. Louis Cardinals. Alongside the Reds' success that year, he also had what could easily be considered his best season, batting .270, with 3 homers and 79 RBIs. He tied his career high for triples with 14 and had his next-best career high in RBIs with 79. He finished second in MVP voting, behind only Bob O'Farrell.\n\nAlthough his speed numbers only decreased from his rookie season, when he stole 19 bases, he still averaged 11 stolen bases per season for his career.\n\nIn 1930, his career took a sudden turn when he was traded to the Giants for pitcher Larry Benton.

Johns\n\nHarold Elford Johns, OC (4 July 1915 – 23 August 1998) was a Canadian medical physicist, noted for his extensive contributions to the use of ionizing radiation to treat cancer.\n\nJohns was born to missionary parents in Szechuan, China. He lived in China until 1926, when political unrest there prompted his parents to return to North America. After spending time in Tacoma, Washington, and in Brandon, Manitoba, his family settled in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nIn Hamilton, Johns pursued a degree in mathematics and physics at McMaster University, and he completed his bachelor of science degree (B.Sc.) in 1936. He then moved to the University of Toronto, where he earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in physics in 1939.\n\nJohns' graduation coincided with the start of World War II. For the duration of the war, he taught physics, mathematics, radar systems, and radio navigation to newly recruited airplane pilots as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Based on his radiography and physics experience, Johns was also involved in non-invasive X-ray testing of metal aircraft castings. A meeting in August 1946 with William Valentine Mayneord, while Mayneord was at the Atomic Energy Project at Chalk River, Ontario, contributed to Johns's making a career in medical physics.\n\nJohns married Sybil Hawkins Johns in 1940. Their marriage lasted until Johns's death fifty-eight years later.\n\nAfter the close of the war, Johns was invited to work with Ertle Harrington at the University of Saskatchewan. It was there that he conducted his pioneering research in the use of cobalt-60 as a gamma ray source for the radiation therapy in cases of cancer.\n\nInterest in nuclear technology exploded in post-war Canada. Nuclear research facilities constructed at the Chalk River Laboratories, Chalk River, Ontario near the end of the war were expanded and opened to civilian research projects. The first operational nuclear reactor outside the United States - the NRX - was located at Chalk River, and it provided a source of activated cobalt-60 for Johns's experiments.\n\nTwo groups - Johns's at the University of Saskatchewan, and another one in London, Ontario - designed and constructed external beam radiotherapy instruments using radioactive cobalt sources. The first treatment of a patient using the new source was carried out in London, Ontario, on 27 October 1951. In November 1951, the first Saskatoon patient, a 43-year-old mother of four, was treated for cervical cancer with a carefully calibrated dose of cobalt-60 radiation.\n\nIn early 1952, \"Maclean's\" magazine had dubbed the cobalt-source radiotherapy machine the \"cobalt bomb\" - a tongue-in-cheek tribute to this peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n\nJohns's original treatment device was used in Saskatchewan until 1972.\n\nIn 1956, Johns assumed the headship of the physics division of the Ontario Cancer Institute at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto.\n\nTo further scientific and medical collaborations between radiologists, radiotherapists, physicians, and physicists, Johns guided the creation of the Graduate Department in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto in 1958. Johns served as the second Chair of the Department, succeeding Arthur Ham in 1960.\n\nOver the course of his career, Johns supervised sixty-eight graduate students, published more than two hundred peer-reviewed papers, and with John R. Cunningham, published the textbook \"The Physics of Radiology\".\n\n\n\n"}

The Municipality of Clanwilliam – Erickson immediately north takes its name from the community.\n\nClanwilliam is in a mainly agricultural area located north of Minnedosa along PR 262. A post office was opened there in 1882 and was originally identified as \"Clan William\" (30-16-17W). In 1902 the post office was moved to coordinate with the Canadian National railway on 13-16-18W. The original name requested for the community by the residents was Lamontagne but Ottawa assigned the present name to honour Richard Meade, 4th Earl of Clanwilliam. Clanwilliam is home of the Fastball team the Clanwilliam Greys. A team which was inducted into the Manitoba Softball Hall of Fame in 2013. Clanwilliam Greys 1972-77: The 1972-77 Clanwilliam Greys Fastball Team represented the 100 inhabitant village of Clanwilliam, north of Brandon. A team in their early 20s, they dominated fastball in southern Manitoba. They were undefeated during the first two seasons in the Minnedosa and District Fastball League; and, combined with tournament games, played 90 games in 1972 and 92 games in 1973. The latter brought them $1,100.00 in tournament prize money. With several additions, they joined the Brandon Centennial Fastball League in 1973, and by 1976, they won the league title and played in the Senior 'A' provincials for the 4th consecutive year. A dominating presence in league and provincial play. The name \"Greys\" comes from the school in Clanwilliam that was called \"Grey School\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2047900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047900", "title": "The Contest", "text": "The Contest\n\n\"The Contest\" is the 51st episode of the NBC sitcom \"Seinfeld\". The 11th episode of the fourth season, it aired on November 18, 1992. In the episode, Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer hold a contest to determine who can go for the longest time without masturbating.\n\nAs NBC thought that masturbation was not a topic suitable for prime time television, the word \"masturbation\" is never used in the episode. The term \"master of my domain\", describing someone who has resisted the urge to masturbate, has since become a catchphrase in popular culture.\n\nThe writer of the episode, Larry David, won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Comedy Series for his work. The episode was ranked number 1 on \"TV Guide\"s 2009 list of \"100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time\".\n\nAt Monk's Café, George tells Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer that his mother caught him masturbating, resulting in her falling over in shock and going to the hospital. George resolves never to masturbate again. When the others express skepticism, they make a bet over who can go the longest without masturbating. The men put up $100, while Elaine puts up $150, as the men insist it's easier for a woman to go without masturbating than a man.\n\nKramer fails almost immediately after seeing a naked woman in a neighboring apartment. The others meet various temptations: George is distracted while visiting his mother in the hospital by an attractive nurse giving another attractive woman a sponge bath; Elaine's fitness club is patronized by John F. Kennedy Jr.; and Jerry is frustrated because his girlfriend Marla, a virgin, will not have sex with him. Jerry sedates his urges by watching children's cartoons.\n\nThe remaining contestants suffer insomnia. Elaine shares a cab ride with Kennedy, and tells him that she lives Uptown near Jerry to extend the ride. He arranges to see her again. The pressure becomes too much for her and she drops out of the contest. While making out on the couch, Marla asks Jerry if they can have sex, claiming that she is ready. However, Jerry mentions the contest, prompting Marla to leave in disgust. Elaine believes that Kennedy has stood her up, but George reveals that Kennedy missed her and went with Marla. They see Kramer with the naked woman across the street.\n\nThat night, everyone sleeps well, but it is not revealed whether Jerry or George won. Marla is in bed with Kennedy, having finally lost her virginity to him.\n\n\"The Contest\" was written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there actually was a contest in which David and some friends of his took part, although he did not initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of \"Seinfeld\", he did not talk about it with Jerry Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. \n\nThe original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word \"masturbate\". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided it would be better to remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about \"The Contest\" was the \"Dovetailing\" of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word \"masturbation\" in the episode (in \"The Ticket\"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says \"you must have a good story; otherwise, it's just masturbation\") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script originally written for \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\", the pilot episode.\n\n\"The Contest\" is the first episode to feature Estelle Costanza, George's mother, as an on-screen character. Estelle Harris, who played the character, had not seen \"Seinfeld\" before she auditioned. The cast and crew commented positively on the similarity in appearance between Harris and Jason Alexander, as it made it more believable that their characters could be related. Alexander's real-life mother looks similar to Harris.\n\nRachel Sweet has a cameo role in this episode as George's cousin Shelly. She appears in the scene with George and his mother in the hospital.\n\nThere are two deleted scenes in \"The Contest\". One features Joyce—the teacher of Elaine's fitness class—in the opening scene talking to Elaine, Jerry, and Kramer. The second features George and Estelle Costanza in the hospital, where the female patient has been moved to the room next door after Estelle complained about her nakedness.\n\n\"The Contest\" is considered one of the best \"Seinfeld\" episodes, winning several awards and positive reviews from the critics. David won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Comedy Series for the episode. He also won a Writers Guild of America Award for his work on the episode. Director Tom Cherones won a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series for this episode. He was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing. \"TV Guide\" ranked the episode #1 on its list of \"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\".\n\n\"The Contest\" received a Nielsen rating of 13/19, meaning that the episode was watched by an average of 13% of households and 19% of all televisions were tuned to the episode when it was broadcast. Approximately 18.5 million people watched the episode then. The first repeat of the episode gave \"Seinfeld\" its highest ratings up till that point, with a 20.1/30 Nielsen Rating. It also received only 31 complaints from viewers, despite the subject matter. There were worries from advertisers who did not want to advertise during the episode due to the topics that were being discussed. Most regular advertisers did not broadcast adverts during the show, because the series did not have good ratings at the time.\n\nThe episode is considered by most reviewers as a success for being able to cover a controversial subject in an inoffensive manner. Jonathan Boudreaux for tvdvdreviews.com said, \"The Emmy-winning script by Larry David introduced the brilliant euphemism 'master of my domain' to our lexicon and helped the series to truly become must-see TV. We know what the episode is about, but the script never explicitly says it. 'The Contest' effortlessly takes a potentially incendiary subject and renders it utterly inoffensive yet hilarious.\" He also said that \"The Contest\" was \"one of the series' most infamous\" episodes. Donna Dorsett from audaud.com commented on the refusal to use the word \"masturbation,\" saying, \"If the word had been used, even once, the show would not have been nearly as hilarious. The episode was totally inoffensive.\"\n\nJames Plath from DVD Town said, \"Estelle Harris, as George's mother, is hilarious.\" Although he himself did not appear in the episode, John F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to have had no problem with appearing as a character in the episode, with his role being played by an uncredited actor.\n\nThis is the second \"Seinfeld\" episode to feature Elaine's fondness for the Kennedy family, the first being \"The Baby Shower\".\n\nSeinfeld claimed that he had never heard of the song \"The Wheels on the Bus\" before recording the episode.\n\nThe original script featured Jerry watching the TV series \"Flipper\". It was changed to \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" due to concerns over music rights.\n\n\"The Contest\" is referenced in other \"Seinfeld\" episodes, the first being \"The Outing\", of which the plot is that Jerry and George are mistakenly outed as gay. During the episode, when George visits his mother, there is a male patient in the hospital, who receives daily sponge baths from a male nurse. Although the winner of the contest is not mentioned, it is implied in \"The Puffy Shirt\" that George was the winner. However, as the plane is going down in \"The Finale\", it is revealed that George had actually cheated, therefore making Jerry the true winner. When Jerry asks him why he cheated, George simply replies, \"Because I'm a cheater!\"\n\n\"The Contest\" is referenced in the \"Shaq\" episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (S02E08), in which Larry David and Shaquille O'Neal watch \"The Contest\" together. Shaq also refers to this episode as his favorite.\n\n\"The Contest\" is referenced in the \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" book \"This Book Sucks\" as an excuse to get out of finishing a homework assignment. In the book, Kramer is mis-identified as \"Creamer\" and the act of masturbation is referred to as \"spanking the monkey.\"\n\nIn the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Jungle Love\", Peter pays the people of a South American village to re-enact \"The Contest\" as one of them hums the \"Seinfeld\" scene-changing music. A Shaman plays Elaine, but she says \"You can't spare one square?\", a reference to \"The Stall\".\n\nIn the \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" episode \"The Gang Does a Clip Show,\" The gang misremember this episode as one of their schemes.\n\nIn the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" episode riffing on \"The Beast of Hollow Mountain\", Crow delivers a short summary of the episode during an in-character riff.\n\nIn 2020, \"The Contest\" was the main source of inspiration for the creators of \"Too Hot to Handle\", a reality television dating show on Netflix which had the contestants abstain from masturbating.\n\n"}

The riding merged with Drumheller in 1963 to form Drumheller-Gleichen.\n\nThe district was named after the town of Gleichen Alberta, that is situated north of Siksika Nation.\n\nDistrict results from the first province wide plebiscite on electricity regulation.\n\nOn October 30, 1957 a stand-alone plebiscite was held province wide in all 50 of the then current provincial electoral districts in Alberta. The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.\n\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments. Question B was slightly modified depending on which city the voters were in.\n\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Gleichen voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plebiscite. The district recorded about average voter turnout, being a couple points above the province wide 46% average.\n\nGleichen also voted on question B1 with just 19 residents lying inside the electoral district within the corporate limits of Calgary. Only 5 residents showed up to vote, they unanimously voted to allow mixed drinking.\n\nOfficial district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. The Social Credit government in power at the time did not considered the results binding. However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new \"Liquor Act\".\n\nMunicipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the Plebiscite were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2047964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047964", "title": "Diphosphenes", "text": "Diphosphenes\n\nDiphosphene is a kind of organophosphorus compound that has a phosphorus-phosphorus double bond, denoted by R-P=P-R'. These compounds are not common but are of theoretical interest. Normally, compounds with the empirical formula RP exist as rings. However, like other multiple bonds between heavy main-group elements, P=P double bonds can be stabilized by a large steric hindrance from the substitutions. The first isolated diphosphene bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene was exemplified by Masaaki Yoshifuji and his coworkers in 1981, in which diphosphene is stabilized by two bulky phenyl group.\n\nIn 1877, Köhler and Michaelis claimed that they synthesized the first isolated diphosphene (PhP=PPh). However, the molecular weight determination and X-ray crystallographic analysis later proved that this \"diphosphene\" only had a P-P single bond. Then the research to diphosphenes kept silent over almost 20 years until Masaaki Yoshifuji and his coworkers isolated the unprecedented diphosphene--bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene in 1981. They first synthesized the (2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)phosphorus dichloride by adding phosphorus trichloride to (2,4,6-tri-butylphenyl)lithium that was the product of the lithium and halogen exchange. The phosphorus dichloride dimerized to a diphosphene after magnesium extracted two chlorine from (2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)phophorus dichloride. P-P bond distance here was measured as 2.034 Å, which was much shorter than the average bond length in (CHP) (2.217Å) and (CHP) (2.237Å), indicating its double bond character. This research was a milestone in diphosphene studies because the product here was the first reported compound that had the isolated localized P=P bond. Moreover, this bulky structure provided a instructive pathway for the future synthesis of diphosphene.\n\nTris(trimethylsilyl)methyl group is also a very bulky group that is often used to stabilize multiple bond between heavy elements. By dropwise addition of (Si(Me))CPCl to sodium napthelenide. P, H and C spectras all proved the formulation of this alkyl-group stabilized diphosphene.\n\nBoryl substituents reveal the potential as both π-electron acceptors and σ-electron donors. The vacant p orbitals enable it to accept the electrons, while low electronegativity reflects the σ donors properties. Computational studies predicted the existence of the boryl-substituted diphosphene and Makoto Yamashita et al. proved it experimentally in 2016. A borylzinc chloride was prepared by from a bulky boryl-lithium compound. This nucleophilic borylzinc compound could attack the phosphorus trichloride and formed boryl-substituted phosphorus dichloride. Similar to the synthesis procedure of a aryl-substituted diphosphene, the boryl-substituted diphosphene was obtained by mixing the boryl-substituted phosphorus dichloride with magnesium. Cyclic voltammogram and UV/Vis Spectrum illustrated that this boryl-substituted diphosphene has lower LUMO level and larger the HOMO-LUMO gap than the aryl-substituted diphosphene.\n\nIn 2019, Stephan and co-workers at the University of Toronto reported the first examples of di-vinyl-substituted diphosphenes via a ring opening/dimerization process from kinetically unstable 2H-phosphirenes.\n\nX-ray analysis indicates certain important bond lengths and angles of the first diphosphene--bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene: P-P=2.034 Å; P-C=1.826 Å; formula_1P-P-C=102.8; formula_1C-P-P-C=172.2. Compared with the bond length of P-P single bond in HPPH (2.238 Å), the P-P bond distance is much shorter, which reveals double bond character. The P-P double bond in bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene exhibits E configuration. But by visible irradiation of the trans isomer, an interconversion between cis isomer and trans isomers would occur. In 1984, M. Koening et al. noticed a different splitting mode and chemical shift in H NMR and P NMR under a direct irradiation of a toluene solution of E-bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene, which suggesting a cis-trans isomerization.\n\nDiphosphene compounds usually exhibit a symmetry-allowed (formula_3) (intense) and symmetry-forbidden electronic transitions (formula_4) (weak). In Raman, there is significant enhancement of P=P stretch in the resonance with allowed electron formula_3 transition than with the forbidden formula_4 transition due to different geometries of excited states and enhancement mechanism. Also the observed strong Raman shifts for (CH(SiMe))P and (CH(SiMe)P=PC(SiMe)) suggest stronger dipnictenes feature of diphosphene compared with P-P single bond.\n\nEfforts to elucidate the excited states of diphosphenes is important and valuable to realize the application of PP double bonds in molecular electronics. In triplets trans-HPPH, the P-P bond length is predicted to be 2.291 Å. It's not only longer than the P-P double bond in ground state trans-bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene, but also longer than that of P-P single bond in HPPH. Calculation of the dihedral angle of trans-HPPH suggests that it's almost 90 degree, which means the formation of formula_7 and formula_8 P-P bonds is forbidden and σ bond is enhanced.\n\nSelected reactivity of diphosphenes is summarized in the following picture, including oxidation, reduction, sulfurization, polymerization, carbene addition, halogenation, photolysis and coordination to the transition-metal\n\nSimilar to the ring-formation behavior in the carbene addition reaction of C=C double bonds, diphosphene can form a P-C-P three-membered ring with dihalocarbene <chem>:CCl2</chem> or <chem>:CBr2</chem>. Diphosphiranes can further rearrange to 1,3-diphospha-allene via ring opening reactions by using MeLi or n-BuLi.\n\nCleavage of C=C double bonds is very common and important in organic chemistry while that of unsaturated bonds between heavy Group 14 and Group 15 elements are lack of investigation. Successful polarization of Si-Si multiple bonds reveals potential interconversion between formula_7 -bonding electrons and lone-pair electrons in heavy Group 14 and Group 15 compounds that contain multiple bonds. Diphosphene, as the typical heavy-element multiple bonds in those compounds, can be cleaved by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), forming NHC-bound phosphinidenes.\n\nDiphosphenes can bind to transition metal either in a η mode by donating a lone pair on phosphorus, or in a η behavior via a formula_7 interaction. If the bulky groups are aryl- groups, arene-coordinated products of η-type coordination are also possible.\n\nIn 1983, Philip P. Power synthesized a transition-metal complex containing P=P double bond (trans-{[Fe(CO)][PCH(SiMe)]2}) via a simple one-step procedure. They mixed Na[Fe(CO)] and dichlorobis(trimethylsilyl)methylphosphine and got a dark red-brown crystals, which was the first complex that contained unbridged P-P double bond. Each phosphorus exhibited terminal coordination nature and the P-P distance was essentially unchanged. Later in 1983, A. H. Cowley reported ArP=PArFe(CO)(Ar=2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl) by treating diphosephene with Fe(CO) or NaFe(CO). In this synthesis procedure, there was only one terminal P-coordination and P-P double bond had Z configuration. Apart from iron, other similar transition metal complexes by reacting diphosphenes with transition metal carbonyls of nickel, tungsten and chromium were discovered and they all exhibited Z configuration. M. Yoshifuji proved E/Z isomerization can take place under lighting, probably via migration of the metal moiety from one side to the other.\n\nApart from the very bulky substituents, a η-coordination of diphosphene to a metal is also possible to stabilize the P-P double bond. In 1982, K. R. Dixon et al. synthesized Platinum and Palladium complexes (M(PhP=PPh)L2), {M=Pt, Pd; L=(PPh3) or PhP[CH]PPh}) which contained side-on coordination. Different from η coordination complex, where P-P still kept the double bond nature, P-P distance in side-on coordination complexes (2.121Å in Pd(PhP=PPh)PPhCHCHPPh) was significantly longer than that in non-coordinated bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)diphosphene.\n\nIf there are aryl- groups on phosphorus, transition-metal can not only bind to the phosphorus directly, but also form arene-coordinated products of η-type coordination. Refluxing diphosphene in 1,4-dioxane with the excess of Cr(CO) can generate mono and bis arene tricarbonylchromium(0) complexes.\n\nDiphosphene is inert to ground-state oxygen but can be oxidized by triplet oxygen to give a mixture of phosphine oxides and hydroxy benzophosphole oxide.<nowiki> Compared to oxygen involved oxidation, reaction of diphosphene with ozone is much more rapid and indicates a 2:1 (ozone : diphosphene) stoichiometry. Ozonolysis of bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)methyl]diphosphene (Tsi</nowiki>P) gives a cyclic diperoxides.\nAluminum hydrides (AlH) such as lithium aluminum hydride can reduce diphosphene to give stable diphosphanes: <chem>ArP=PAr\\ +\\ AlH\\rightarrow ArHP-PHAr</chem>(Ar=2,4,6-BuCH)\n\n"}

Let formula_1 denote the norm of vector \"x\" and formula_2 the inner product of vectors \"x\" and \"y\". Then the underlying theorem, attributed to Fréchet, von Neumann and Jordan, is stated as:\n\nThe various forms given below are all related by the parallelogram law:\n\nThe polarization identity can be generalized to various other contexts in abstract algebra, linear algebra, and functional analysis.\n\nIf \"V\" is a real vector space, then the inner product is defined by the polarization identity\n\nIf \"V\" is a complex vector space the inner product is given by the polarization identity\n\nwhere formula_9 is the imaginary unit. Note that this defines an inner product which is anti-linear in its first argument and linear in its second argument. For the convention using the reversed definition, one needs to take the complex conjugate:\n\nThe parallelogram law can be used to derive other forms:\nIn a normed space (\"V\", formula_3), if the parallelogram law holds, then there is an inner product on \"V\" such that formula_4 for all formula_5.\nConsidering the real case the inner product will be the one suggested by the polarization identity\n\nWe need to prove that this is actually an inner product and that the norm induced by this product is formula_3 which defines (\"V\", formula_3).\nFor formula_18 to be an inner product it must satisfy the following properties:\n\nIn our case formula_20 with formula_21\nWhich is obvious because formula_23\nFirst we show that formula_25:\n\nformula_26 remembering that formula_27\n\nNow using the parallelogram law we can see that:\n\nformula_28\n\nWe will use these three form depending on what we need.\n\nConsidering formula_29 we can show that formula_30 using the homogeneity and the subadditivity of formula_31:\nBecause formula_33 (Property of norms).\n\nThis property holds in particular with formula_34 as formula_35. Using symmetry and the sign property already shown above\nTherefore formula_37. Being at the same time greater and smaller than 0 we can be sure that formula_38\n\nIf formula_39 then let be formula_40 (formula_41):\n\nformula_42\n\nNow we show that formula_43 \nBecause formula_45 (triangular inequality). \n\nAgain considering the just found relation with formula_46 in the place of formula_47 we can prove that formula_48. Therefore formula_49 \n\nCombining the equations we have found we can conclude that formula_50 Concluding that formula_51 is linear and therefore it is an inner product. \n\nNow we complete the proof showing that formula_51 induces formula_31:\n\nformula_54\n\nThe second form of the polarization identity can be written as\n\nThis is essentially a vector form of the law of cosines for the triangle formed by the vectors u, v, and u – v. In particular,\n\nwhere \"θ\" is the angle between the vectors u and v.\n\nThe basic relation between the norm and the dot product is given by the equation\n\nThen\n\nand similarly\n\nForms (1) and (2) of the polarization identity now follow by solving these equations for u · v, while form (3) follows from subtracting these two equations. (Adding these two equations together gives the parallelogram law.)\n\nIn linear algebra, the polarization identity applies to any norm on a vector space defined in terms of an inner product by the equation\n\nAs noted for the dot product case above, for real vectors \"u\" and \"v\", an angle θ can be introduced using:\n\nwhich is acceptable due to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:\n\nThis inequality ensures that the magnitude of the above defined cosine ≤ 1. The choice of the cosine function ensures that when formula_63 (orthogonal vectors), the angle θ = π/2 or −π/2, where the sign is determined by an orientation on the vector space.\n\nIn this case, the identities become\n\nConversely, if a norm on a vector space satisfies the parallelogram law, then any one of the above identities can be used to define a compatible inner product. In functional analysis, introduction of an inner product norm like this often is used to make a Banach space into a Hilbert space.\n\nThe polarization identities are not restricted to inner products. If \"B\" is any symmetric bilinear form on a vector space, and \"Q\" is the quadratic form defined by\n\nthen\n\nThe so-called symmetrization map generalizes the latter formula, replacing \"Q\" by a homogeneous polynomial of degree \"k\" defined by \"Q\"(\"v\") = \"B\"(\"v\", …, \"v\"), where \"B\" is a symmetric \"k\"-linear map.\n\nThe formulas above even apply in the case where the field of scalars has characteristic two, though the left-hand sides are all zero in this case. Consequently, in characteristic two there is no formula for a symmetric bilinear form in terms of a quadratic form, and they are in fact distinct notions, a fact which has important consequences in L-theory; for brevity, in this context \"symmetric bilinear forms\" are often referred to as \"symmetric forms\".\n\nThese formulas also apply to bilinear forms on modules over a commutative ring, though again one can only solve for \"B\"(\"u\", \"v\") if 2 is invertible in the ring, and otherwise these are distinct notions. For example, over the integers, one distinguishes integral quadratic forms from integral \"symmetric\" forms, which are a narrower notion.\n\nMore generally, in the presence of a ring involution or where 2 is not invertible, one distinguishes ε-quadratic forms and ε-symmetric forms; a symmetric form defines a quadratic form, and the polarization identity (without a factor of 2) from a quadratic form to a symmetric form is called the \"symmetrization map\", and is not in general an isomorphism. This has historically been a subtle distinction: over the integers it was not until the 1950s that relation between \"twos out\" (integral \"quadratic\" form) and \"twos in\" (integral \"symmetric\" form) was understood – see discussion at integral quadratic form; and in the algebraization of surgery theory, Mishchenko originally used \"symmetric\" \"L\"-groups, rather than the correct \"quadratic\" \"L\"-groups (as in Wall and Ranicki) – see discussion at L-theory.\n\nIn linear algebra over the complex numbers, it is customary to use a sesquilinear inner product, with the property that formula_67 is the complex conjugate of formula_68. In this case the standard polarization identities only give the real part of the inner product:\n\nUsing formula_70 (holds with the convention that the inner product is linear in the second variable), the imaginary part of the inner product can be retrieved as follows:\n\nFinally, in any of these contexts these identities may be extended to homogeneous polynomials (that is, algebraic forms) of arbitrary degree, where it is known as the polarization formula, and is reviewed in greater detail in the article on the polarization of an algebraic form.\n\nThe polarization identity can be stated in the following way:\n"}

His name is thus the equivalent of \"Joe Public\", \"Joe Everyman\", \"Joe Shmoe\", or \"John Doe\".\n\nThe first appearance of \"Zé Povinho\" was on 22 May 1875, in \"A Lanterna Mágica\" magazine, although that appearance did not attribute him with a name. He was named in the 6 December 1875 issue of the same magazine. Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro kept drawing this character throughout his lifetime (nearly another 30 years); the drawings were published in many of the more popular magazines and newspapers such as \"O António Maria\", \"A Paródia\", \"O Commércio do Porto Illustrado\" and \"Pontos nos iis\".\n\nPovinho is a well-regarded, kindly man who lives simply, and is regularly depicted as mocking the powerful.

{"id": "2048010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048010", "title": "Vector W8", "text": "Vector W8\n\nThe Vector W8 is a sports car produced by American automobile manufacturer Vector Aeromotive Corporation from 1989 to 1993. It was designed by company founder and chief designer Gerald Wiegert while receiving refinements by Vector's head of engineering David Kostka. The W8 was the production version of the Vector W2 prototype that the company demonstrated throughout the 1980s.\n\nThe W8 was an improved version of the company's earlier prototype, the W2. Production was delayed after the W2 was presented to the public in 1976 due to a downturn in the world economy and insufficient financial backing. Weigert was finally able to secure sufficient financial reserves by the late 1980s, and the company grew from one building and four employees to four buildings and 80 employees, enough to accomplish Weigert's dream to create his ultimate sports car. The design of the W8 was inspired by the Alfa Romeo Carabo, which had a futuristic aerodynamic design. The W8 combined the design characteristics of the Carabo with technologies and geometry from fighter jets of the era. The company utilized the newest and most advanced aerospace materials in manufacturing the W8, and the term \"Aeromotive Engineering\" was used by the company when referring to the manufacturing process of the W8. Prior to production, the W8 successfully passed DOT crash tests, as well as emissions tests. The semi-aluminum monocoque chassis was epoxy bonded and riveted with an aluminum honeycomb structure floor pan, and 5,000 aircraft specification rivets were used in the car's assembly. The body was made largely of lightweight carbon fiber and Kevlar.\n\nThe car was based around a Rodeck aluminum resleevable racing engine featuring TRW forged pistons, Carrillo stainless-steel connecting rods, stainless-steel valves, roller rocker arms, a forged crank, a dry-sump oiling system with three separate filters and braided stainless-steel hoses, with anodized red and blue fittings. The transmission was a highly modified Turbo-Hydramatic 425 General Motors three-speed automatic that had been used in front wheel drive Oldsmobile Toronado dating back some two decades earlier. The engine had two intercooled Garrett turbochargers, and had an advertised power output of at 5,700 rpm and of torque at 4,900 rpm on 8 psi of boost pressure. Boost pressure levels were driver adjustable between 8 and 14 psi and during dyno testing at the factory, the engine recorded a maximum power output of at 14 psi of boost pressure. The W8 utilized special Michelin XGT Plus tires (255/45ZR-16 at the front, 315/40ZR-16 at the rear) bespoke to the car with wide wheels in a design made to the owner's specifications. The W8's suspension utilized double A-arms up front and De Dion tube suspension at the rear, located by four trailing arms that stretched all the way forward to the firewall. Koni adjustable shocks, with concentric springs, were used all around. Brakes were 13-inch vented discs with Alcon aluminum 4-piston calipers at the front and rear.\n\nThe interior was upholstered in premium leather and suede, along with wool carpeting and floor mats. Electrically adjustable Recaro leather seats and a premium air-conditioning system completed the luxurious interior. The seating position of the driver was slightly towards the center of the car for better drivability. The dashboard had four display screens with information about the car's status, along with buttons for adjusting the car's various functions. The dashboard displays were similar to fighter jets of the era. Some driving amenities were excluded, such as power-assisted steering and anti-lock brakes, to lower the curb weight. The W8 generated a skidpad acceleration of 0.97g, the highest in its class.\n\nVector claimed the W8 could reach a projected top speed of , with acceleration from achievable in a time of 3.9 seconds. During testing at the Bonneville Salt Flats, the W2 prototype attained a maximum speed of with a Donovan aluminum block engine that was less powerful than a production W8's engine, as reported by Top Wheels magazine. This top speed was attained while still using a high downforce rear wing. Later aerodynamic testing further honed efficiency, bringing the car's drag coefficient (formula_1) down to just 0.32 prior to DOT crash testing in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The W8's design included subtle changes to the body during the production run, so that the initial car off the line looked slightly different from the last. Changes included the elimination of some gills, a lower front fascia and air splitter, and adjustments of the rear wing, mirror intakes, and front grill. After the top speed testing, production Vector W8s were no longer fitted with a removable glass roof due to buffeting that occurred at extreme speeds.\n\nSeventeen customer cars and two pre-production cars were produced before Vector went into receivership in 1993.\n\nThe AWX-3 and AWX-3R were intended to be the successors of the W8. The model designations stood for Avtech Wiegert Experimental, 3rd generation, with the R suffix meaning the roadster version. Series production of the AWX-3 never began, production of the W8 ended in 1993 after a hostile takeover by the primary shareholder, Megatech. Wiegert sued Megatech and won back the design copyrights, equipment, and remaining unsold cars. In 1995, Megatech began production of the M12 which was based on the Lamborghini Diablo and was loosely based on the design of the AWX-3.\n\nIn 1991, the car received negative publicity when tennis star Andre Agassi returned his for a refund after the rear carpeting burned due to an overly hot exhaust system. Agassi had insisted upon delivery before the car was fully prepared, and Vector agreed to deliver it on the condition that the car would be kept in storage and not driven until Vector adjusted the emissions to make it road legal.\n\nAlso in 1991 \"Car and Driver\" was unable to complete testing of the W8 because all three cars provided broke down in different ways. In a 2017 article, the magazine noted that the Vector W8 serves as an example of why they don't believe manufacturer's claims about a vehicle without testing it themselves and described the W8 as \"vaporware\".\n\nIn contrast to the negative \"Car and Driver\" article, \"Road & Track\" road tested the car without encountering any problems, and published tests of the W8 in its March 1991 and August 1992 issues, praising nearly every aspect of the car's performance. In their tests, the W8 recorded a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 4.2 seconds. Despite not conducting a top speed test, they provided an estimated top speed based on the redline RPM of the W8's top gear in its 3-speed automatic transmission. The review concluded with: \"Hats off to Gerald Wiegert and his team of dedicated engineers, and to all others with the fortitude and determination to have their dreams see the light of day.\"\n\n"}

Largely inspired by the British use of herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency, it was one of the so-called \"Rainbow Herbicides\" that included the more infamous Agent Orange. Agent Purple and Orange were also used to clear brush in Canada.\n\nAgent Purple was chemically similar to the better-known Agent Orange, both of them were consisting of a mixture of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and in both cases the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T constituted equal shares of the Agent. The difference was in the form of 2,4,5-T. While all the 2,4,5-T in Agent Orange was as the \"n\"-butyl ester, the 2,4,5-T in Agent Purple was itself mixture of \"n\"-butyl and isobutyl ester forms (60%:40% respectively). The Agent Purple had then the following composition: 50% \"n\"-butyl ester 2,4-D, 30% \"n\"-butyl ester 2,4,5-T, and 20% isobutyl ester 2,4,5-T. \n\nEven prior to Operation Ranch Hand (1962-1971) it was known that 2,4,5-T, and thus Agents Purple, Pink, Green and Orange, were contaminated with tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), an extremely toxic and persistent by-product formed during synthesis. Dioxin-levels varied considerably from batch to batch, and even within the same batch; generally, agents produced earlier, such as Purple and Pink suffered from higher levels of contamination. A 2003 \"Nature\" paper by Stellman et al., which re-apprised the average TCDD content of Agent Orange from the 3 ppm that USAF had reported to a level of 13 ppm, also estimated that Agent Purple may have had 32.8 ppm of TCDD on average. A sample of Agent Purple archived at Eglin Air Force Base had an even higher content of 45 ppm TCDD.\n\nAgent Purple was used only in the earliest stages of the spraying program, between 1962 and 1965 as well as in earlier tests conducted by the US military outside of Vietnam. About 500,000 gallons were sprayed in Vietnam total. (~1.9 million liters). When the need to clear brush around CFB Gagetown in Canada arose, quantities of Agent Purple and Agent Orange were also sprayed there in a testing program during 1966 and 1967.\n"}

In 1938, he was elected the President of Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a position in which he served till his death.\n\nBahadur Yar Jung wanted his own princely home state, Hyderabad, to be separate from the rest of India as a Islamic/Muslim state with Sharia Law in force.

{"id": "2048074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048074", "title": "Australian Party", "text": "Australian Party\n\nThe Australian Party was a political party founded and led by Billy Hughes after his expulsion from the Nationalist Party. The party was formed in 1929, and at its peak had four members of federal parliament. It was merged into the new United Australia Party in 1931, having never contested a federal election.\n\nBilly Hughes was a former prime minister who had been successively a member of the Labor Party, the National Labor Party, and the Nationalist Party. By 1928, he was the \"de facto\" leader of a group of backbenchers hostile to the government of Stanley Bruce (who had replaced him as Nationalist leader in 1923). He and his supporters began to frequently cross the floor and vote against the government, particularly on the controversial subject of industrial relations. On 22 August 1929, Hughes and Edward Mann were expelled from the Nationalist Party for voting in favour of an unsuccessful censure motion against the government. Tensions finally came to a head on 10 September, when Hughes successfully moved an amendment to the government's flagship Maritime Industries Bill. Bruce took this to be a vote of no confidence, and called an election for 12 October. Labor under James Scullin won a landslide victory, while Hughes and two other ex-Nationalists were re-elected as independents.\n\nAfter the 1929 election, Hughes made unsuccessful attempts to rejoin both the Nationalists and the Labor Party, in the hopes that he could return as prime minister. He eventually resolved to form his own party, which he hoped would secure the balance of power. The new party was launched on 2 December 1929. Three other federal MPs joined Hughes as members—Walter Marks, George Maxwell, and Senator Walter Duncan. The press regarded the Australian Party as a simply a vehicle for Hughes' ambitions; \"The Sun\", a Sydney tabloid, was the only newspaper to give it favourable publicity. The party claimed 75 branches and 4,000 members at its peak, but the only real activity took place in the electorates of its MPs. It was predominantly based in New South Wales, with a limited presence in Victoria and abortive attempts to expand to South Australia. Hughes and Marks were the party's chief financial backers, because membership fees were deliberately kept low and one of the party's planks was to refuse corporate donations. However, Hughes in particular was stingy with his money, sending the party treasurer only £100 out of a requested £250 for expenses and even then complaining about the cost.\n\nThe first election the Australian Party contested was a by-election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in July 1930, in the Lane Cove constituency. With Frederick Dunn (a former mayor of Lane Cove) as its candidate, the party polled 25.6% of the vote, putting it in third place behind Labor (30.7%) and the Nationalists (43.5%). Despite it being a safe seat for the Nationalists, it was suggested by some that the Australian Party would have won if Labor had not contested the election.\n\nAt the October 1930 state election in New South Wales, the Australian Party fielded candidates in 18 seats (all but two in Sydney). It polled 9.8% of the vote in seats it contested, but only 2.1% state-wide. The campaign was widely regarded as a failure, given that the party had hoped to win multiple seats. Hughes had little interest in state politics, and campaigned mainly on federal issues. He presented his party as an alternative to the incumbent Nationalist government of Thomas Bavin, but anti-government voters overwhelmingly voted for Jack Lang's Labor Party, which won a landslide victory with 55.0% of the vote. Hughes complained frequently about the lack of press coverage his party received, calling the media \"as conformist as fascist Italy or Soviet Russia in following a party line\".\n\nGeorge Maxwell resigned from the party in May 1930 to rejoin the Nationalists, citing policy differences. The party secretary, W. F. Jackson, did likewise in August, personally attacking Hughes in an open letter to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\". In September, Hughes published a 16-page pamphlet titled \"Bond or Free? Sir Otto Niemeyer’s Report\", which sold nearly 50,000 copies in a month (at threepence each). It was widely quoted in newspapers. The statement effectively placed the Australian Party to the left of the federal Labor government on economic issues, and close to the radical views held by Lang Labor. \"The Sun\" withdrew its support of the party, and Walter Marks resigned his membership, citing Hughes' failure to consult him.\n\nThe Australian Party virtually ceased to exist after the 1930 state election. On 15 April 1931, John Latham—the Nationalist leader and leader of the opposition—wrote to Hughes, Joseph Lyons, and Earle Page suggesting that they unify their parties and factions and form a united opposition to the Scullin government. Hughes and Lyons accepted, and the new United Australia Party (UAP) officially came into existence on 7 May, with Lyons as leader. Hughes and Walter Duncan, the Australian Party's sole remaining parliamentary members, joined the new UAP, as did Marks and Maxwell.\n\nHughes' biographer Laurie Fitzhardinge wrote of the Australian Party: \"The party had no popular roots, but had been created from above, and only the untiring efforts of Hughes and Duncan kept it going. It lacked experience, it lacked a coherent programme, and above all it lacked finance\".\n\nThe Australian Party presented itself as apolitical. It had a \"vague and eclectic platform\" which mixed left-wing populism and economic nationalism. Hughes wanted the party to be \"democratic and progressive […] indeed so democratic that any Labor man may join and support it\". Some policies were more or less lifted directly from the Labor platform, such as the abolition of state governors and legislative councils. Hughes nonetheless denounced the Labor Party as controlled by communists, while simultaneously attacking the Nationalists as responsible for the Great Depression. Other Australian Party policies reflected Hughes' pet interests, such as amending the constitution to increase the federal government's powers over commerce and industrial relations. In general the party platform put forward few specifics, and the party was almost wholly reliant on the personal appeal of Hughes for its support.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a national survey of the songs which are the most popular in nightclubs across the country and is compiled from reports from a national sample of disc jockeys. It was launched as the Disco Action Top 30 chart on August 28, 1976, and became the first chart by \"Billboard\" to document the popularity of dance music. Since its inception, several artists have set various records and garnered multiple achievements. In January 2017, \"Billboard\" proclaimed Madonna as the most successful artist in the history of the chart, ranking her first in their list of the 100 top all time dance artists and Janet Jackson being the second most successful dance club artist of all-time; Madonna also holds the record for the most number-one songs, with 50. Katy Perry holds the record for having eighteen consecutive number-one songs. Perry's third studio album, \"Teenage Dream\" (2010), became the first album in the history of the chart to produce at least seven number-one songs by a lead artist between 2010–2012, a record it held solely until Rihanna's eighth studio album \"Anti\" produced eight chart toppers through 2016-2017. Rihanna is the only artist to have achieved five number-one songs in a calendar year.\n\nThe first number-one song on the Dance Club Songs chart for the issue dated August 28, 1976, was \"You Should Be Dancing\" by the Bee Gees; it spent five weeks atop the chart and was the group's only number-one song. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the closures of clubs, \"Billboard\" has temporarily suspended the chart. The most recent number-one song on the Dance Club Songs chart for the issue dated March 28, 2020, is \"Love Hangover 2020\" by Diana Ross.\n\nDance Club Songs has undergone several incarnations since its inception in 1974. Originally a top-10 list of tracks that garnered the largest audience response in New York City discothèques, the chart began on October 26, 1974 under the title \"Disco Action\". The chart went on to feature playlists from various cities around the country from week to week. \"Billboard\" continued to run regional and city-specific charts throughout 1975 and 1976 until the issue dated August 28, 1976, when a 30-position \"National Disco Action Top 30\" premiered. This quickly expanded to 40 positions, then in 1979 the chart expanded to 60 positions, then 80, and eventually reached 100 positions from 1979 until 1981, when it was reduced to 80 again.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"></ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 1980s the chart maintained 80 slots until March 16, 1985 when the Disco charts were splintered and renamed. Two charts appeared: \"Hot Dance/Disco\", which ranked club play (50 positions), and \"Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales\", which ranked 12-inch single (or maxi-single) sales (also 50 positions, later reduced to 10 and discontinued after 2013, replaced with Dance/Electronic Digital Songs).\n\nOnly \"Hot Dance Club Songs\" still exists today. In 2003 \"Billboard\" introduced the Hot Dance Airplay chart (now known as Dance/Mix Show Airplay), which is based solely on radio airplay of six dance music stations and top 40 mix shows electronically monitored by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. These stations are also a part of the electronically monitored panel that encompasses the Hot 100.\n\nOn January 26, 2013, \"Billboard\" added a new chart, Dance/Electronic Songs, which tracks the 50 most popular Dance and Electronic singles and tracks based on digital single sales, streaming, radio airplay, and club play as reported on the component Dance/Electronic Digital Songs, Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs, and Dance Club Songs charts. Radio airplay is not limited to that counted on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the closures of clubs, \"Billboard\" made the decision to temporarily suspend the Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nAlthough the disco chart began reporting popular songs in New York City nightclubs, \"Billboard\" soon expanded coverage to feature multiple charts each week which highlighted playlists in various cities such as San Francisco, San Diego, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Detroit and Houston (among others). During this time, \"Billboard\" rival publication \"Record World\" was the first to compile a dance chart which incorporated club play on a national level. Noted \"Billboard\" statistician Joel Whitburn has since \"adopted\" \"Record World\"s chart data from the weeks between March 29, 1975 and August 21, 1976 into \"Billboard\"s club play history. For the sake of continuity, \"Record World\"s national chart is incorporated into both Whitburn's \"Dance/Disco\" publication (via his Record Research company) as well as the 1975 and 1976 number-ones lists.\n\nWith the issue dated August 28, 1976, \"Billboard\" premiered its own national chart (\"National Disco Action Top 30\") and their data is used from this date forward.\n\n \n\nSources:\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n"}

It broadcast foreign language programming 24 hours a day, in cooperation with major international broadcasters. Capital FM also aired Yle broadcasts about Finland in English and Russian, French and German. Capital FM could be listened to in Greater Helsinki (97.5 MHz), Tampere (88.3 MHz), Turku (96.7 MHz), Lahti (90.3 MHz) and Kuopio (88.1 MHz). In August 2005, the name of the station was changed into Yle Mondo. The FM frequencies outside Helsinki were unavailable for use by the Yle Mondo, but services continue in Helsinki. The channel is also available throughout Finland as one of the audio channels of the Yle Digital Television.\n\nCapital FM had started in 1978 as a relay of Yle External Service (Yle Radio Finland) programming for the capital metroplex area. With the gradual expansion of foreign language output on YLE Radio Finland, the station was on the air almost 12 hours per day, but there were blank hours between segments. For some special occasions, a full-service schedule was produced, such as the tenth anniversary of the CSCE 1975 Summit arranged in 1985 and Summit between George Bush and Michail Gorbachov in September 1990.\n\nDuring an international broadcasting meeting (hosted by the CBC) in Hamilton, Ontario, in the spring of 1990, the head of external broadcasting at Yle, Juhani Niinisto, had talked with various international broadcasters about the possibility of a launching a relay-based service. The response had been positive, but final corporate go ahead was not given in Finland until the summer of 1991.\n\nThe first programme lineup included the Voice of America in its light VOA Europe version, BBC World Service and Deutsche Welle in German. Radio France Internationale in French joined shortly. By the mid-1990s, the station had added ABC Radio Australia (via WRN, London), National Public Radio (US) and the Spanish domestic news network RNE Todo Noticias in Spanish. For some two years, the station also carried the CSpan Weekly Radio Journal from the US.\n\nSpanish was important as tens of thousands of Finnish nationals spent part of winters in Spain. It was also better to relay a domestic channel than the external broadcaster from that country. In the early 2000s, China Radio International in English, domestic services from Norway and Denmark, in Norwegian and Danish, South African Broadcasting Corporation SABC in English (via WRN) and the Vatican Radio in Italian had been added. The Vatican Radio was taken as efforts to get RAI in Italian had failed.\n\nIn 1998, the Yle international foreign language production was changed to be produced primarily for the Capital FM, with secondary use as an international service. That meant early morning production for the domestic prime time. With the closing of the Yle external service foreign language production in English, German and French in October 2002, the Yle News unit established within Yle News kept producing morning newscasts on the previous schedule.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the service was expanded, part-time, to five other Finnish cities where additional Yle frequencies were available.\n\nFor several years, the Capital FM offered separate DAB versions on two DAB channels in Southern Finland, one of them was in English only, the other in non-English foreign languages. The service was closed with the end of DAB services in the mid-2000s.\n\n"}

Fronted by lead singer/bassist Gregory \"Sugar Bear\" Elliot, the group has had a fluctuating membership over the years, but they have maintained a fairly loyal following.\n\nThe band's biggest hit was 1988's \"Da Butt\" which charted at number 35 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Following the Spike Lee soundtrack success the band signed a deal with Virgin Records and scored two additional Top Billboard Hits. The first hit was \"Buck Wild\" which was co-written and co-produced by William \"Ju Ju\" House and the late Kent Wood. \"Buck Wild\" peaked at #7 on the R&B/Hip Hop Charts. The second Top Billboard hit following the group's #1 R&B hit \"Da Butt\" was released on February 2, 1988.\n\n\"Taste of Your Love,\" sang by E.U.'s lead singer, Edward \"Junie\" Henderson, was the band's last Billboard top-ten hit. It was co-written (along with Harold \"Chucky\" Lloyd) and produced by Marvin Ennis. Ennis also played all of the instruments and did all of the background vocals on the track contrary to what the credits on the \"Livin' Large\" album reflect. The song \"Da Butt\" and the actual band which included Gregory Elliott, William House, Ivan Goff, Kent Wood, Valentino Jackson, Edward Henderson, Mike Taylor, Darryl Hayes, and J. Foxx, were featured in Spike Lee's film \"School Daze.\"\" The song was written by Marcus Miller and performed by E.U. The song reached number one on the Billboard's Hot Black Singles chart[1] for the week of April 23, 1988, and was ranked #61 on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s. The music video was directed by Spike Lee.\n\nE.U. further injected DC go-go into the public consciousness with the release of Beck's \"Where It's At\", a mid 1990s alt-radio staple. The Dust Brothers, who produced Beck's accompanying album, \"Odelay\" sampled the intro break from E.U.'s \"Knock Him Out Sugar Ray.\"\n\nE.U. experienced a resurgence in the mid to late 1990s, by partnering with the jazz, gospel, pop and gospel session singer, Maiesha Rashad, while performing under the name Maiesha and The Hip Huggers featuring E.U. Maiesha and The Hip Huggers have headlined events and concert venues such as B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, DAR Constitution Hall, Black Family Reunion and D.C.'s Stone Soul Picnic and Unifest.\n\nIn 2012, \"Da Butt\" was licensed for an Xbox 360 game Dance Central 3.\n\nIn 2019, E.U. have reunited to perform Da Butt at the 2019 BET Awards.\n\n\n\n"}

As a devoted pacifist, he later joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). He was a Fellowship holder at Woodbrooke College (now Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre), Selly Oak, Birmingham during 1934-5.\n\nFuchs was both a committed Christian and socialist and wrote numerous books on the relationship of Marxism and christianity. In 1958 Fuchs became honorary member of the East German CDU, that was part of the East German government and pursued a pro-communist course. On 9 February 1961 Fuchs was member of a Christian commission that was charged with discussing the issues of state and church with the GDR leader Walter Ulbricht. Since then Emil Fuchs engaged for normalisation of relations between the state and church in East Germany. Though a loyal GDR supporter Fuchs occasionally opposed the party line: he was against the persecution of the Young Congregations (\"Junge Gemeinden\") in 1950s and when conscription was introduced in East Germany, he managed to persuade the communist leadership to allow an alternative for armed service. Men who refused usual service in the army could accordingly serve as 'construction soldiers' (), who, as evident from the term, did mostly construction tasks.\n\nIn 1906 he married Else Wagner (1875–1931), who later committed suicide.

In present-day Las Vegas, the site is at the southeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue, less than one mile north of the downtown area and Fremont Street. This is the only U.S. state park located in a city that houses the first building ever built in that city. The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 1, 1972. The site is memorialized with a tablet erected by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1997 and with Nevada Historical Marker #35.\n\nMormon missionaries arrived on June 14, 1855 and selected a site, along one of the creeks that flowed from the Las Vegas Springs, on which they would build the fort. The fort served as the midpoint on the trail between Salt Lake City, Utah and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe fort was surrounded by high adobe walls that extended for . While called a fort, it was never home to any military troops but like many Mormon forts provided a defense for the local settlers against an Indian attack. As a result of the beginning of the Utah War, the Mormons abandoned the fort.\n\nAround 1860, a small detachment of U.S. Army troops was assigned to protect the settlers at the fort.\n\nThe fort was called Fort Baker during the Civil War, named after Edward Dickinson Baker. In a letter from Col. James Henry Carleton written to Pacific Department headquarters, December 23, 1861, Carleton mentions his plan to send an advance party of seven companies from Fort Yuma to reoccupy Fort Mojave and reestablish the ferry there. Carleton then intended to send on from there three cavalry companies and one of infantry to the Mormon fort at Las Vegas, and establish a post called Fort Baker. This was in preparation for an advance to Salt Lake City the following year. The move to reoccupy Fort Mojave never occurred as planned because Carleton's California Column at Fort Yuma were sent instead into Arizona and New Mexico to evict the Confederates there the next year. However, Fort Mojave was later reoccupied in 1863 by Union troops from California. In 1864, a road survey party led by Captain Price, Company M, 2nd California Cavalry traveled on the route from Fort Douglas to Fort Mojave passing through Las Vegas, stopping for water there on June 10. No mention is made of any garrison there. Presumably the post was never garrisoned during the Civil War.\n\nIn 1865, Octavius Gass re-occupied the fort and started the irrigation works, renaming the area to Los Vegas Rancho (later renamed Las Vegas in 1902). Gass defaulted on a loan to Archibald Stewart in 1881 and lost the ranch, with Stewart and his wife Helen becoming the new caretakers. In 1902, William A. Clark's San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad acquired the property from Helen Stewart along with most of what is now downtown Las Vegas, transferring most of the company's land to the now defunct Las Vegas Land and Water Company.\n\nOwnership of the fort and the land around it changed hands many times and it had several close calls with destruction. In 1955, the land was acquired by the Las Vegas Elks. With support of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers, the city of Las Vegas acquired the fort in 1989. Long-term protection was gained when the state acquired the site as a state park in 1991. A $4.5 million renovation and visitor center, designed by assemblageSTUDIO, was completed in 2005.\n\nA visitor center is available to help explain the history of the fort.\n\n\n"}

The work had its first performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 2 December 1970 conducted by Sir Colin Davis and produced by Sir Peter Hall. There is a recording with the original cast.\n\nThe first American performance was in 1974 at Northwestern University, and the first German performance in 1987 at the Musiktheater im Revier in Gelsenkirchen. In 1984 Tippett authorised Meirion Bowen to create a reduced orchestration for a revival with the London Sinfonietta at the Wilde Theatre, conducted by Howard Williams. The reduced version has been revived six times, with productions in Britain, America, Australia, and Austria. There was a revival at the Royal Opera House in 1988, directed by Nicholas Hytner and, in 2005, Scottish Opera produced the opera for the Tippett centenary.\n\nThe psychiatrist Mangus introduces the action. Thea enters, soon followed by the hysterical girl Flora, who rushes screaming into Thea's arms. Faber enters, and Thea sends Flora off with Mangus, then scolds Faber for (as she imagines) playing the lecher with Flora. Faber protests \"I do not flirt with Flora; Flora screams before I...impossible!\"\n\nMel and Dov enter dressed up as Ariel and Caliban from \"The Tempest\". They are lovers, but Mel flirts with Thea, and out of jealousy Dov makes a play for Faber. This tense foursome is disrupted when Flora again rushes in screaming: Thea's sister Denise has arrived for a visit, and she is disfigured by torture. Denise introduces herself in a dramatic aria about her struggle for universal justice. This becomes an ensemble, and the act closes on Mel's soft rejoinder, \"Sure, baby.\"\n\nThe second act is a dreamlike series of dialogues. In the score, the composer described his vision of the staging: \"It appears as if the centre of the stage had the power to 'suck in' a character at the back of the stage, say, and 'eject' him at the front. During their passage through the maze, characters meet and play out their scenes. But always one of the characters in these scenes is about to be ejected while a fresh character has been sucked in and is whirled to the meeting point.\"\n\nThe first pair to appear are Thea and Denise, who speak in parallel, unable to meet. Thea is replaced by Faber, who does make some contact with the touchy Denise, but she is then replaced by Flora, who again reacts to Faber with screams. She is whirled offstage and Denise reappears with a horsewhip, followed by Dov, who continues his earlier flirtation. Faber is responsive, but is spun offstage and replaced by Mel, and the lovers share a duet acknowledging that their affair is ending. Dov now disappears to be replaced by Denise, who sees Mel as representing the oppressed of the earth (the tune to \"We Shall Overcome\" appears in the orchestra). Characters appear and disappear in quick succession until the sequence ends with Flora alone with Dov.\n\nDov comforts Flora by encouraging her to sing, and she performs \"Die liebe Farbe\" from Schubert's \"Die schöne Müllerin\". Dov responds with the song that would later form the first part of the \"Songs for Dov\" cycle. The act ends on Mel's re-entry.\n\nMangus declares that his production of \"The Tempest\" has begun: \"This garden is now an island,\" and the characters obligingly play out the roles Mangus assigns them. In addition to Mel and Dov as Caliban and Ariel, Faber becomes Ferdinand, Flora becomes Miranda, and Mangus is Prospero. Thea and Denise remain themselves and comment on the action, critical of Mangus's controlling and voyeuristic role as impresario of the drama. At the conclusion of the charade Mel and Denise leave together, followed by Dov, who is not yet able to let go. Flora goes off alone. Thea and Faber are reconciled.\n\n\n\n"}

The Grand Prix and World Championship Tennis (WCT) were the two predecessors to the current tour for male players, the ATP Tour, with the Grand Prix being more prominent.\n\n\nThe manipulation of Grand Slam tournaments by professional promoters at the start of the Open Era led promoter Jack Kramer, the top male tennis player in the world in the 1940s and 1950s, to conceive of the Grand Prix in 1969. He described it as \"a series of tournaments with a money bonus pool that would be split up on the basis of a cumulative point system.\" This would encourage the best players to compete regularly in the series, so that they could share in the bonus at the end and qualify for the special championship tournament climaxing the year.\n\nWhen only a few contract players showed up for the 1970 French Open, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) approved Kramer's Grand Prix proposal. In April 1970, its president Ben Barnett announced the creation of the Grand Prix circuit, on an experimental basis during its first year.\n\nThe first World Championship Tennis tournament was held 1-3 February 1968 in Kansas City, U. S. The first NTL tournament was held 18-21 March 1968 in São Paulo, Brazil. In July 1970, the WCT absorbed the NTL. In 1971, WCT ran a twenty-tournament circuit with the year-ending WCT Finals held in November. At the end of 1970, a panel of journalists had ranked the best players in the world. The best thirty-two men based on this ranking were invited to play the 1971 WCT circuit, which included Ilie Năstase, Stan Smith, Jan Kodeš, Željko Franulović, and Clark Graebner.\n\nThe Australian Open was part of the WCT circuit while the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open were Grand Prix events. The conflict between the ILTF (running the Grand Prix) and WCT was so strong that Rosewall, Gimeno, Laver, Emerson, and other WCT players boycotted the 1971 US Open. The third professional circuit that year was the U. S. Indoor Circuit run by Bill Riordan, the future manager of Jimmy Connors.\n\nIn July 1971, the ITLF voted to ban all WCT contract professionals from competing in ITLF tournaments and from using ITLF facilities from the beginning of 1972 onwards. The 1972 editions of the French Open and the Wimbledon Championships excluded all contract professional players. Then in April 1972, the ITLF and WCT agreed to divide the 1973 tour into a WCT circuit that ran from January through May and a Grand Prix circuit that ran for the rest of the year. The conflict between the ITLF and WCT led all tennis players to attend the 1972 US Open where they agreed to form their own syndicate, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), through the efforts of Jack Kramer, Donald Dell, and Cliff Drysdale.\n\nIn 1973, there were four rival professional circuits: the WCT circuit battled with the U. S. Indoor Circuit from January to April and the Grand Prix until July; both tours competed with the \"European Spring Circuit\" until June.\n\nThe WCT and Grand Prix circuits were separate until 1978, when the Grand Prix circuit integrated the WCT circuit. In 1982, the WCT circuit split from the Grand Prix again and created a more complex WCT ranking, similar to the ATP ranking. The split was short-lived, however, and in 1985 the Grand Prix absorbed the four remaining WCT tournaments.\n\nDuring the 1988 US Open the ATP, led by then-World No. 1 Mats Wilander, staged an impromptu meeting known as the \"Parking Lot Press Conference\" during failed negotiations with the MTC over the organisation of the Grand Prix and key issues such as player fatigue. During this press conference, the ATP declared that it would be starting its own tour in 1990, meaning that the 1989 Grand Prix would effectively be its last. \n\nThe governance of the Grand Prix was led by the Men's International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC) from 1974 through 1989. (Its name was shortened to the Men's Tennis Council (MTC) in 1988.) The MIPTC's duties included imposing fines for violations of its Code of Conduct, drug testing, and administrating the Grand Prix circuit. It also moved the Australian Open from its December date – which had been adopted in 1977 so that it could be included in the Grand Prix points system – to January for the 1987 edition so that the Grand Prix Masters could be held in December from 1986 onwards. It failed, however, to prevent the number of tournaments on the Grand Prix circuit from growing, with 48 being held in 1974 compared to 75 in 1989.\n\nBased on USLTA Tennis Yearbooks and Guides and World of Tennis yearbooks the history of sponsors is as follows:\n\nIn 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals, led by Hamilton Jordan, replaced the MTC as the sole governing body of men's professional tennis and the ATP Tour was born. The nine most prestigious Grand Prix tournaments became known as the \"Championship Series Single Week\" from 1990 through 1995. In 1996, Mercedes began sponsoring these series of events, renamed as the \"Super 9\" until 1999. In 2000, they became known as the \"Tennis Masters Series\" until 2004, then the \"ATP Masters Series\" until 2009. They are now called the ATP World Tour Masters 1000. Grand Prix tournaments below this level were originally called the Grand Prix Super Series. They were retained by the ATP and renamed as the \"Championship Series\". All remaining Grand Prix Tour events became part of the \"World Series\".\n\n\"NB: All rankings were calculated using the Grand Prix points system and do not necessarily reflect the ATP rankings at the same time.\"\n 1971\n 1972\n 1973\n 1974\n\n 1976\n 1977\n 1978\n 1979\n\n 1981\n 1982\n 1983\n 1984\n\n 1986\n 1987\n 1988\n 1989 \"(last year)\"\n\n\n"}

Despite many expeditions, no physical proof of Noah's Ark has been found. Many of the supposed findings and methods are regarded as pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology by geologists and archaeologists.\n\nModern organized searches for the ark tend to originate in American evangelical circles. According to Larry Eskridge, \nAn interesting phenomenon that has arisen within twentieth-century conservative American evangelism – the widespread conviction that the ancient Ark of Noah is embedded in ice high atop Mount Ararat, waiting to be found. It is a story that has combined earnest faith with the lure of adventure, questionable evidence with startling claims. The hunt for the ark, like evangelism itself, is a complex blend of the rational and the supernatural, the modern and the premodern. While it acknowledges a debt to pure faith in a literal reading of the Scriptures and centuries of legend, the conviction that the Ark literally lies on Ararat is a recent one, backed by a largely twentieth-century canon of evidence that includes stories of shadowy eyewitnesses, tales of mysterious missing photographs, rumors of atheistic conspiracy, and pieces of questionable \"ark wood\" from the mountain. (...) Moreover, it skirts the domain of pop pseudoscience and the paranormal, making the attempt to find the ark the evangelical equivalent of the search for Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster. In all these ways, it reveals much about evangelicals' distrust of mainstream science and the motivations and modus operandi of the scientific elite.\n\nArk-seeker Richard Carl Bright considers the search for the ark a religious quest, dependent on God's blessing for its success. Bright is also confident that there is a multinational government conspiracy to hide the \"truth\" about the ark:\n\nI firmly believe that the governments of Turkey, Russia, and the United States know exactly where the ark sits. They suppress the information, but (...) God is in charge. The structure will be revealed in its time. We climb the mountain and search, hoping it is, in fact, God's time as we climb. Use us, O Lord, is our prayer.\n\nAccording to Genesis 8:4, the Ark came to rest \"on the mountains of Ararat.\"\nEarly commentators such as Josephus, and authorities quoted by him, Berossus, Hieronymus the Egyptian, Mnaseas, and Nicolaus of Damascus, record the tradition that these \"mountains of Ararat\" are to be found in the region then known as Armenia, roughly corresponding to Eastern Anatolia.\n\nAccording to Jewish Rabbinic tradition, the Ark was looted in antiquity, the remains being used for idol worship, as related in the Talmud tractate Sanhedrin 96a by Sennacherib circa 705 – 681 BC, and as related in the Midrash anthology Yalkut Shimoni by Haman circa 486–465 BC.\n\nSyrian tradition of the early centuries BC had a tradition of the ark landing at Mount Judi, where according to Josephus the remains of the ark were still shown in the 1st century BC. The location of the \"Place of Descent\" (αποβατηριον, i.e., \"Nakhchivan\") described by Josephus was some 100 km to the southeast of the peak now known as Mount Ararat, in what is today Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nSometime in the third century AD, Epiphanius of Salamis is recorded as having asked critics: \"Do you seriously suppose that we are unable to prove our point, when even to this day the remains of Noah's ark are shown in the country of the Kurds?\" Later, in the fourth century AD, the Archbishop of Constantinople John Chrysostom similarly asked during a sermon, \"Do not the mountains of Armenia testify to it, where the ark rested? And are not the remains of the ark preserved there, to this very day, for our admonition?\"\n\nMarco Polo (1254–1324) wrote in his book, \"The Travels of Marco Polo\":\nSir Walter Raleigh, writing c. 1616, made a laborious argument taking up several whole chapters of his \"History of the World\", that the term \"Mountains of Ararat\" originally encompassed all the adjoining and taller ranges of Asia, and that Noah's Ark could only have landed in the Orient – especially since Armenia is not technically east of the plain of Shinar (or Mesopotamia), but more northwest.\n\n\nSearches since the mid-20th century have been largely supported by evangelical, millenarian churches along with local farmers and sustained by ongoing popular interest, faith-based magazines, lecture tours, videos and occasional television specials.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Located in Atlanta, Georgia, it replaced a shantytown known as Tanyard Bottom or Tech Flats. It was completed on August 15, 1936, but was dedicated on November 29 of the previous year by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The apartments included bathtubs and electric ranges in each unit, 189 of which had garages. Central laundry facilities, a kindergarten and a library were also provided. Techwood was intended to eliminate the slums that the poor had been living in, but eventually became one itself.\n\nThe complex was designed by Georgia Tech alumnus and architect Flippen David Burge (later Stevens & Wilkinson), and organized by Charles Forrest Palmer, a real estate developer who had become an expert on public housing and would later head up both the newly created Atlanta Housing Authority and the Chamber of Commerce. The landscaping was designed by Edith Henderson, who also designed the neighboring Clark Howell Homes with her partner Grace Campbell.\n\nThe name came from Techwood Drive, in turn named for nearby Georgia Tech. The project included a 300-student dormitory for Georgia Tech, McDaniel Dormitory, commonly referred to as Techwood Dorm. It was run by the Atlanta Housing Authority. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s the area was synonymous with urban blight in Atlanta.\n\nTechwood Homes was built on land cleared by demolishing the Flats, a low-income integrated neighborhood adjacent to downtown that had included 1600 families, nearly one-third of whom were African American. The Public Works Administration remade the neighborhood with 604 units for white families only.\n\nThe neighboring Clark Howell Homes was built in 1941 in a less institutional style. A. Ten Eyck Brown was the architect. Clark Howell was reserved for whites only until 1968, with an all-black counterpart at the University Homes project (built 1938) near Atlanta University Center.\n\nExcept for a few historic buildings, Techwood Homes was demolished in 1996 before the 1996 Summer Olympics. It and neighboring Clark Howell Homes are now a mixed-use area called Centennial Place. The first phase opened in 1996 just before the Centennial Olympics, hence the new name. Former residents were relocated to other areas, and given Section 8 vouchers to pay part of the rent. Many moved back into Centennial Place, though it had far fewer subsidized units than Techwood Homes.\n\n\n"}

He was Ordinary Professor of Fundamental Theology at the University of Münster, and a consultant to the synod of German dioceses. He is regarded as one of the most important German theologians after the Second Vatican Council, who influenced liberation theology and focused on compassion.\n\nMetz was born on 5 August 1928 in Auerbach in der Oberpfalz and grew up there. As a teenager, Metz was drafted into the German military in 1944, towards the end of the Second World War. Six months before the end of the war, he was captured by the Americans and sent to prisoner of war camps in Maryland and then Virginia. After the war, he moved back to Germany. He studied theology and philosophy from 1948, first in Bamberg, then in Munich and at the University of Innsbruck, He completed his dissertation on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger in 1951. Metz was ordained a priest in 1954, working in ministry from 1958 to 1961. He was then promoted to Ph.D., with a work on the theology of Thomas Aquinas under the supervision of Karl Rahner. His experience in the war matches that of the German Calvinist theologian Jürgen Moltmann who would go on to write with Metz on political theology against a background of direct confrontation with Nazism. In 1962–63, he was granted a scholarship from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n\nHe was professor of Fundamental Theology at the University of Münster from 1963 to 1993, where he developed a Theology after Auschwitz (Holocaust theology). He introduced philosophical and political ideas of 1968, by Ernst Bloch and the Frankfurt School of Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, in theology, which was received with opposition. His concepts were applied by the liberation theology in Latin America. He participated in the founding of the University of Bielefeld, and was a leading member of the international Paulus-Gesellschaft dedicated to a dialogue of Christianity and Marxism. After the Second Vatican Council, he was a consultant of the papal secretariate for the \"noncredentibus\" from 1968 to 1973. Metz was a consultant of the Würzburg Synod of the German dioceses from 1971 to 1975, and was the principal author of its document \"Unsere Hoffnung\" (Our hope) which became a key document for the reception of the Second Vatican Council in Germany.\n\nMetz lived in Münster until his death on 2 December 2019.\n\nA student of Karl Rahner, Metz broke with Rahner's transcendental theology in a turn to a theology rooted in praxis. Metz was at the centre of a school of political theology that strongly influenced liberation theology. He is regarded as one of the most influential post–Vatican II German theologians. His thought turned around fundamental attention to the suffering of others. Key topics of his theology were memory, solidarity, and narrative. Works in English include: \"The Emergent Church\", \"Faith in History and Society\", \"Poverty of Spirit\", and \"Hope Against Hope\". Collected articles can be found in \"A Passion for God: The Mystical-Political Dimension of Christianity\", translated by Matthew Ashley and in John K. Downey, ed., \"Love's Strategy: The Political Theology of Johann Baptist Metz\".\n\nFundamental to Metz's work is the concept of \"dangerous memory\", which relates to \"anamnesis\" in the Greek New Testament, a term which is central to the theology of the Eucharist. Metz spoke variously of \"the dangerous memory of Jesus Christ\", \"the dangerous memory of freedom (in Jesus Christ)\", the \"dangerous memory of suffering\", etc. One of the motivating factors for this category is Metz's determination, as a Christian theologian from Germany, to rework the whole of Christian theology from the ground up in light of the disruptive experience of the Holocaust. This need explains in part his break with Rahner, whose transcendental method appeals to historicity but does not come to terms with actual history. Metz was in dialogue with progressive Marxism, especially Walter Benjamin and the authors of the Frankfurt School. He levelled a fierce critique of what he called bourgeois Christianity and believed that the Christian Gospel had become less credible because it had become entangled with bourgeois religion. His work \"Faith in History and Society\" develops apologetics, or fundamental theology, from this perspective.\n\nA key motif of his theology is compassion, as a sensitivity for the suffering of others, a compassion of God, and also a passion for God (\"Leidempfindlichkeit für andere, die Mitleidenschaft Gottes, auch die Leidenschaft für Gott\").\n\n\n"}

The senior member of a group of composers collectively known as the Boston Six, Paine was one of those responsible for the first significant body of concert music by composers from the United States. The Boston Six's other five members were Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, Edward MacDowell, George Chadwick, and Horatio Parker.\n\nPaine grew up in a musical family in Maine. His grandfather, an instrument maker, built the first pipe organ in the state of Maine and his father and uncles were all music teachers. His father carried on the family musical instrument business. One uncle was an organist. Another was a composer. In the 1850s Paine took lessons in organ and composition from Hermann Kotzschmar, completing his first composition, a string quartet, in 1855 at the age of 16. After his first organ recital in 1857, he was appointed organist of Portland's Haydn Society, and gave a series of recitals with the object of funding a trip to Europe where he hoped to further his music education.\n\nOn arrival in Europe Paine studied organ with Carl August Haupt and orchestration with Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht in Berlin. He also toured Europe giving organ recitals for three years, establishing a reputation as an organist that would precede his return to the United States. After returning to the US and settling in Boston in 1861, he was appointed Harvard's first University organist and choirmaster. While acting in this role Paine offered free courses in music appreciation and music theory that would become the core curriculum for Harvard's newly formed academic music department (the first such department in the United States) and his appointment as America's first music professor. He would remain a member of the faculty of Harvard until 1905, just a year before his death.\n\nPaine's well received 1867 Berlin premiere of Mass in D would give Paine a reputation that helped him to shape the musical infrastructure of the United States. His pioneering courses in music appreciation and music theory made the curriculum of Department of Music at Harvard a model for American Departments of Music. His service as a director of The New England Conservatory of Music (and the lectures he gave there) establish his place at the root of an instruction chain that leads (through Eugene Thayer) from George Chadwick to Horatio Parker to Charles Ives. He was the first guest conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the final concerts of its first season, and his works were audience favorites. Paine is noted for beginning American's symphonic tradition. He is also known for writing America's first oratorio (St. Peter), the Centennial Hymn that (with orchestra) opened the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, was a founder of American Guild of Organists, and co-editor of \"Famous Composers and their Works\".\n\nIn 1889, Paine made one of the first musical recordings on wax cylinder with Theo Wangemann, who was experimenting with sound recording on the newly invented phonograph.\n\nJohn Knowles Paine was among the initial class of inductees into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nThe \"Grove Music Encyclopedia\" says of him:\n\n... Paine served the Harvard community for 43 years. By his presence and by his serious concern with music in a liberal arts college he awakened a regard for music among many generations of Harvard men. His writings testify to his insistence upon the place of music within the liberal arts...\n\nPaine Hall, the concert hall for Harvard's Department of Music, is named after him. A history of that building includes many references to his pioneering role in music at Harvard.\n\nOpera\n\nOrchestral\n\nChorus and Orchestra\n\nOrgan\n\n\n\n"}

The Miami neighborhood is home to one of the largest concentrations of African Americans in South Florida, Census. Although often referred to as \"Model City\" both historically and by the City of Miami government, the neighborhood is more commonly referred to as \"Liberty City\" by local residents.\n\nIt is serviced by the Miami Metrorail at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza and Brownsville stations along NW 27th Avenue.\n\nOnce a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.\n\nInto the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.\n\nConstruction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.\n\nCrime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate post–civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.\n\nThe plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama \"Miami Vice\", which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.\n\nInto the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy and NFL players Chad \"Ocho Cinco\" Johnson, Antonio Brown, and Willis McGahee.\n\nClimate gentrification is increasing real estate values in parts of Miami that are at higher elevation such as Liberty City, and decreasing values in lower-elevation areas. By 2017, Liberty City, along with Little Haiti started becoming more attractive to investors. A community land trust is planned to maintain affordability for current residents.

The first performance of the opera was at the Teatro San Angelo, Venice, in November 1727. It is to be distinguished from an earlier Vivaldi opera of 1714, \"Orlando furioso\", set to much the same libretto, once thought to be a revival of a 1713 opera by Giovanni Alberto Ristori but now considered by Vivaldian musicologists to be a fully-fledged opera by Vivaldi himself.\n\nThe opera – more formally, the \"dramma per musica\" – alternates arias with recitative, and is set on an island at an unspecified time. The story line combines several plot lines from Ariosto: the exploits of the hero Orlando are detailed, as well as the tale of the sorceress Alcina.\n\nIn a delightful garden in which two springs are seen, Medoro escapes from a shipwreck into the arms of his beloved Angelica. Alcina magically helps Medoro and he recounts how he was first captured, then shipwrecked. Orlando is jealous of Medoro, but Angelica lies and says Medoro is her brother.\n\nAlcina is attracted to the knight Ruggiero. She uses her magic to make him forget Bradamante and love her instead. Bradamante discovers Ruggiero's \"betrayal.\" She shows him the ring he gave her therefore breaking Alcina's spell. Ruggiero feels guilty for his actions.\n\nIn a grove with green secluded spots, Astolfo reflects how he loves Alcina, but is tormented by her unfaithfulness.\n\nMeanwhile, in a mountainous alpine region with a high, precipitous cliff, Angelica and Medoro swear their love and part ways. To rid herself of Orlando, Angelica sends him to fight a monster who guards an elixir of youth.\n\nOrlando enters a cavern and is trapped. Realizing Angelica's faithlessness, he digs his way out.\n\nAngelica and Medoro marry in a countryside at the foot of a hill. They carve their vows on a nearby tree. Orlando finds the tree, and on reading the inscription, becomes so furious that he starts destroying the trees.\n\nThe place is at the Entrance Hall before the Temple of Hecate. Astolfo believes Orlando dead. With Ruggiero and Bradamante, he plots revenge against Alcina. The secret of Alcina's power lies in an urn, which is locked in the temple of Hecate. They await Alcina's return.\n\nInside the temple of Hecate, Bradamante disguises herself as a man. Alcina falls in love with her.

Based on feedback from fans who heard the leaked version, the band decided to record two harder rocking songs, \"World Gone Wild\" and \"Nothin' Comes Close,\" which were included on the American version of the album, which now did not retain \"I'm Not That Way\" from the Japanese release.\n\n\"Arrival\" produced a minor adult contemporary hit with the ballad \"All the Way.\" Peaking at No. 56 on \"Billboard\"'s album chart, \"Arrival\" was the band's first album to not receive at least gold status since 1977's \"Next.\" It was also their last studio album under Columbia Records, which had been the band's label since their self-titled 1975 debut.\n\nThe US and SACD editions do not include \"I'm Not That Way\" as on the Japanese edition, but instead add \"World Gone Wild\" and \"Nothin' Comes Close\"\nThe US CD edition features an edited version of \"To Be Alive Again\", the full version is only on the Japanese CD\n\n\n\n"}

It was a registered party from 1999 to 2002, and its members have contested mayoral, local, and national elections since 1998.\n\nThe People's Choice Party was formed in 1999 by Rusty Kane and Doug Wilson. Wilson had previously held a protest walk from New Plymouth to Wellington, during which he collected 56,000 signatures for a petition. \n\nWilson stood for the 1998 Taranaki-King Country by-election as a candidate for People's Choice. The People's Choice Party was officially registered before the 1999 election, which required at least 500 paid members. The party contested the 1999 general election to show opposition to the MMP voting system and received 387 party votes and a total of 154 electorate votes in two electorates. This included Kane standing in the Te Tai Hauāuru Maori electorate, the first non-Maori to stand in that seat.\n\nThe party was deregistered after Doug Wilson's retirement in 2002. However, it continued to act as an unregistered party and Rusty Kane remained active in politics. As of 2015, Kane had unsuccessfully stood in six national elections, run for the Stratford mayoralty, the Taranaki District Health Board, twice for a place on the Taranaki Regional Council, and once for the New Plymouth council. He also ran for Bay of Plenty Regional Council in 2016. He has frequently stood for electorates and local councils for areas he does not live and has been described as a \"serial campaigner\" and as \"the man who runs more than a nose during winter\". Kane has run sometimes under the People's Choice banner and sometimes as an independent; he also joined the Conservative Party but left in 2012 citing its 'anti-gay stance'.\n\nKane has described the party as a \"ginger group, set up to advocate a political voice on behalf of small groups and individuals\". Kane has stated that the party seeks to highlight issues, not to win seats. For example, the party stood in the 2009 Mt Albert by-election to support the binding of Citizens Initiated Referenda.\n\nIn 2016, The People's Choice began to contest local body elections and won three counselor seats on the Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury).

The structure is found in living and extinct groups of animals including bats, birds, some dromaeosaurs, pterosaurs, gliding mammals, some flying lizards, and flying frogs. The patagium that stretches between an animal's hind limbs is called the uropatagium (especially in bats) or the interfemoral membrane.\n\nIn bats, the skin forming the surface of the wing is an extension of the skin of the abdomen that runs to the tip of each digit, uniting the forelimb with the body.\n\nThe patagium of a bat has four distinct parts:\n\nIn the flying pterosaurs, the patagium was composed of the membrane forming the surface of the wing, supported primarily between the body and the elongated fourth finger.\n\nThe patagium of a pterosaur had three distinct parts:\n\nFlying squirrels, sugar gliders, colugos, anomalures and other mammals also have patagia that extends between the limbs; as in bats and pterosaurs, they also possess propatagia and uropatagia. Though the forelimb is not as specialised as in true flyers, the membrane tends to be an equally complex organ, composed of various muscle groups and fibers. Various species have styliform bones to support the membranes, either on the elbow (colugos, anomalures, greater glider, \"Eomys\") or on the wrist (flying squirrels).\n\nIn gliding species, such as some lizards and flying frogs, it is the flat parachute-like extension of skin that catches the air, which allows gliding flight.\n\nIn some lepidoptera insect species, it is one of a pair of small sensory organs situated at the bases of the anterior wings.\n\nIn birds, the propatagium is the elastic fold of skin extending from the shoulder to the carpal joint, making up the leading edge of the inner wing. Many authors use the term to describe the fold of skin between the body (behind the shoulder) and the elbow that houses the outer segments of the \"latissimus dorsi caudalis\" and \"triceps scapularis\" muscles. Similarly the fleshy pad that houses the follicles of the remiges (primary and secondary feathers) caudal to the hand and the ulna is also often referred to as a patagium. The interremigial ligament that connects the bases all the primary and secondary feathers as it passes from the tip of the hand to the elbow is thought to represent the caudal edge of the ancestral form of this patagium.\n\n\"Yi qi\" has a rather elaborate, superficially bat-like patagium in the forelimbs, unique among dinosaurs. The exact extent isn't clear, but it was extensive and supported by a long styliform bone as in gliding mammals. Other scansoriopterygids might have had similar patagia, based on their long third fingers.\n\nA patagium has been found in the dinosaur \"Psittacosaurus\", and ran from the animal's ankle to the base of the tail.\n\n"}

Quebradillas is spread over seven wards and Quebradillas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nQuebradillas is called \"La Guarida del Pirata\" (The Pirate's Hideout). A well known beach in the area, Puerto Hermina, is home to an old structure known to have been a hiding place for pirates and their contraband.\n\nThe town was founded in 1823 by Felipe Ruiz. This town derives its name from the large amount of streams flowing through it. The name literally means \"small streams\".\n\nQuebradillas is home to one of the 20 designated forest preserves in Puerto Rico, the Guajataca Forest. The forest serves as a great example of an unusual topography known as \"karst country\". Karst is characterized by dissolved limestone formations such as sinkholes and haystack-shaped hills known as \"mogotes\". It is also home to the beautiful man-made reservoir, Guajataca Lake ( long), where you can fish for largemouth bass, peacock bass, tilapia and bluegill (in Spanish known as \"chopa\"). You can also go hiking or camping. The Puerto Rico Council of the Boy Scouts of America maintains a campground on the lake known as Camp Guajataka. The name Guajataca comes from the name of a Taíno Indian chief who lived in this area. This Indian chief also gives his name to Guajataca Beach to the north where Río Guajataca flowing from Guajataca Lake meets the Atlantic Ocean. Guajataca Beach is popular with surfers and is known for its white sands and wild waters. This beach is ideal for sunning and collecting seashells.\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Quebradillas is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as .\n\nThe general climate of the town is subtropical.\n\nThe United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Quebradillas was 7,432. \n\nThere are 6 beaches in Quebradillas.\nThe main attractions of Quebradillas are:\n\nA small shopping center called Quebradillas Plaza is located in this municipality along with some manufacturing industries.\n\nAn event which negatively affected the region in the decade of the 1990s was the disappearance of tax exemptions to the private corporations [section 936 of the code of the US Internal Revenue Service ], which at the time was the ideal excuse for the closing of one of the greater manufacturers of textiles in the northwest area of the island. This decline of the industry of the needle occurred similarly in the bordering cities like Isabela and Camuy, generating a regional economic decline as the locals greatly depended on these jobs. In nearby towns like Hatillo, Mayagüez and Aguadilla, the arrival of mega stores and new shopping centers attracted the jobs that used to be in Quebradillas, helping to create the general vision of the town as \"ghostly\" because there is little movement in the city.\n\nAt the same time, since the Island lacks mass public transportation, people must resort to private cars (known as \"carro publico\", public car in English) used as a bus as a mode of transportation. This, coupled with the fact that the only road to access the important cities, the Puerto Rico Highway 2, is congested most of the day, makes it difficult for people in the area to find work and thus contributes to the general economic decline.\n\nIronically, the town possesses one tunnel that at the beginning of the 20th century was utilized by steam driven trains that traveled throughout the Island. The disappearance of the same is considered as one of the most ironic facts of the modern history of Puerto Rico, since these railways were very extensive, built through earthly bluffs and were of great utility. Today, their absence only aggravates the problem of mass transit and the dependence on privately owned vehicles as the only method of transportation.\n\nThe economy, entering into the 21st century, is based on retail sales. Many small businesses are located along the two main thoroughfares that cross Quebradillas. These consist mainly of light hardware, bakeries, pharmacies, seafood restaurants, American fast food chains and automobile car repair shops.\n\nThe town has bank branches for Banco Popular and local savings and credit Unions. These credit unions are most noted for their involvement in common and cultural activities, sponsoring and participating in festivals of typical music [Festival of the Gourd in December], sports and educational activities.\n\nSpearheaded by then governor Sila María Calderón, Law 1-2001 was passed in 2001, to identify Puerto Rico's marginalized communities. In 2017, then governor Ricardo Rosselló created a new government agency to work with the Special Communities of Puerto Rico Program. Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Quebradillas: Guajataca, Montadero, Parcelas Italas in Terranova, San Antonio, and Sector Las Piedras Barrio Cocos.\n\n\nThe town's official basketball team is \"<nowiki>Los Piratas'</nowiki>\"\" \"who have won a dramatic number of tournaments in the past. Presently the team has made a \"comeback\" and has won the championship of the island (2013).\n\n\nThe town's government is a small unit with few powers it can execute. Small elections are hosted in specific schools every four years to choose a town mayor.\n\nThere are 4 bridges in Quebradillas.\n\nIt has two red quarters. The red stands for struggle, effort and sacrifice. The other two quarters have each five green and white stripes, similar to those that appear in the shield.\n\nThe three waved stripes represent the quebradillas, over the green background of the vegetation. The fish and the walking stick (distinctive of the traveler), are insignias of San Rafael Arcángel, by allusion from the episodes narrated in the book of Tobías in the Old Testament.\n\nThe town features many public and private schools. There is also a public electronic library near Los Chorritos Pirata water park.\n\nNew schools have been created thanks to a government initiative to have \"21st century\" schools.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After the Grouse demonstrated that the new layout was a success, the British Air Ministry placed an order for three prototype fighters based on the Grouse (and therefore derived ultimately from Folland's Nieuport Nighthawk fighter of 1919), but powered by a Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar III radial engine, as the \"Nighthawk (thick-winged)\".\n\nThe first of the prototypes (Gloster built a fourth machine as a company-owned demonstrator), by now known as the Grebe I, flew during May 1923. The performance of these prototypes during testing at RAF Martlesham Heath was good, and the Air Ministry decided to order the type into production as the Grebe II, this having a Jaguar IV engine.\n\nLike the Sopwith Snipe it replaced, the Grebe was a single-seat, single-engined biplane of fabric-covered wood construction. The fuselage had ash longerons and spruce stringers joined to plywood formers, while the single-bay wings (which had a considerable overhang outboard of the struts), had fabric-covered spruce spars and ribs. Two synchronised .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns were mounted on the fuselage top decking.\n\nGrebes entered service with the RAF during October 1923 when a flight of 111 Squadron re-equipped with the new fighter. The Grebe was popular in RAF service, being much faster than the Snipe that it replaced and was also very agile. One problem with the Grebe was that it suffered from wing flutter, owing to the large overhang outside the interplane struts, which led to all RAF aircraft being modified with additional Vee-struts supporting the outer upper wing. Another problem was the Jaguar engine, which was heavy and unreliable, being prone to catching fire.\n\nA total of 133 Grebes were produced, including the four prototypes, 108 Grebe II single-seat fighters and 21 two-seat dual-control trainers. Grebes were retired from the RAF in 1929, replaced in part by the Gloster Gamecock, which was a developed Grebe, (Gloster fighter design, from Nighthawk to Gloster Gladiator was evolutionary).\nTwo Grebes were modified for suspension beneath the R33 airship on a 'trapeze' for \"parasite\" trials. The Grebe was developed into the Gloster Gamecock fighter, which also entered production for the RAF. A Grebe was given to New Zealand by Sir Henry Wigram and another two Grebes were acquired by the New Zealand Permanent Air Force, fore-runner of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, entering service in March 1928 and serving for more than ten years until the mid-1938. The two survivors were used as instructional airframes until destroyed in 1943–44.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played college football for Utah State University, and was drafted by the Redskins in the third round of the 2004 NFL draft. Cooley holds the Redskins' franchise record for most receptions at tight end.\n\nCooley attended Logan High School in Logan, Utah, and lettered in football, wrestling, and baseball. As a senior football tight end, he caught 45 passes for 625 yards (13.34 yards per rec. avg.) and on defense, added eight sacks and numerous tackles. In wrestling, he posted a 54–0 record his senior season and won the state championship and All-America honors.\n\nCooley finished his college football career at Utah State University with 95 receptions for 1,255 yards (13.2 yards per reception). He was part of a talented receiving unit with teammate Kevin Curtis.\n\nIn 2003, his senior season at Utah State, Cooley led the NCAA in receptions by a tight end.\n\nIn 2017 he was inducted into the Utah State University Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2004, Cooley was drafted in the third round, with the 81st overall pick, of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. After being used sparingly in the first half of the 2004 season, Cooley began to be used more extensively in the last eight games, developing a rapport with Redskins quarterback Patrick Ramsey. In his first NFL season, Cooley led the team in touchdowns with six, while recording 37 receptions for 314 yards, catching three passes of more than twenty yards, and getting 23 first downs. He finished the season with an average of 8.5 yards per catch. He was the Redskins' nominee for the NFL Man of the Year award for his work reading to children and feeding the poor. He is also lesser known by the nickname \"Johnny White Guy,\" which was given to him by Clinton Portis during one of Portis' colorful press conferences, but the off color nickname did not stick.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, Cooley had a solid season as a receiver, catching 71 passes for 774 yards and seven touchdowns, including three in a game versus the rival Dallas Cowboys, breaking the Redskins franchise record for receptions as a tight end in a single season. Those three touchdowns cost Cooley his fantasy football playoff game, because his opponent had Cooley on his fantasy team. He led all NFC tight ends in fan voting for the annual Pro Bowl with 422,314 votes, but following player and coach voting (each group had 1/3 weight), was not chosen for the position. He was named first team All-NFC by Pro Football Weekly.\n\nIn 2006, Cooley got off to a slow start under the play-calling of the Washington Redskins' new offensive coordinator, Al Saunders. With only three receptions in the first two weeks of the season, Cooley appeared to not have a place in the new offensive scheme, but in the weeks following, became a growing part of the Redskins offense. He ended the season with numbers slightly less than his sophomore outing, but was still one of the top tight ends in the game.\n\nOn September 1, 2007, Cooley signed a six-year $30 million contract extension.\nIn 2007, he had scored in all but one game as of week six. In the sixth week, Cooley had 9 receptions for a career-high 105 yards and one touchdown in a 17-14 loss against the Green Bay Packers. On December 18, 2007 he was named to the 2007 Pro Bowl team with Redskins tackle Chris Samuels, long-snapper Ethan Albright, and the late safety Sean Taylor. Cooley set an NFL record by being the only tight end in league history to have six or more touchdowns in each of his first four seasons.\n\nIn 2008, Cooley scored only one touchdown. In Week 5, he had 8 receptions for a career-high 109 yards and one touchdown from a pass from Antwaan Randle El in a 23–17 win against the Philadelphia Eagles. Cooley finished the season with 83 catches for 849 yards and 1 touchdown, with career highs in both catches and yardage. He was the only player not to get into the stat book in the 2009 Pro Bowl.\n\nCooley broke his ankle in a \"Monday Night Football\" matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on October 26, 2009. It was initially speculated that Cooley would miss the remainder of the 2009 season. On October 27, 2009, Cooley commented via Twitter that the break may not have been as bad as originally thought and that he could possibly return in as little as four weeks. His longest play of the year was a 66-yard touchdown. On November 30, 2009, Cooley was placed on injured reserve.\n\nCooley played in all sixteen games of 2010 season, but had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee after the season on January 3, 2011.\n\nStill recovering from the arthroscopic surgery to his left knee, Cooley did not play in any of the preseason games in 2011. Cooley played only in the 2011 season's first five games. After the win in Week 1 against the New York Giants, Cooley became the Washington Redskins' all-time leader in receptions at the tight end position with 422 receptions, breaking the previous franchise record of 421 set by Jerry Smith.\nIn Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys, Cooley subbed in for Darrel Young and Mike Sellers, who were both injured, and played the fullback position for the first time in his career.\nIn Week 6 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cooley suffered a broken finger.\nOn October 25, 2011, Cooley was placed on injured reserve after his knee was examined further by his doctor and he was told that it would take another four or five weeks before full recovery.\n\nDuring the preseason, it was reported that Cooley's knee was completely healed from the surgery and that he even lost 20 pounds to prepare for the 2012 season. However, Cooley was released by the Redskins on August 28, 2012. It had been hinted by general manager Bruce Allen that Cooley could return to the Redskins.\n\nOn October 21, 2012, Cooley agreed to re-sign with the Redskins after Fred Davis tore his Achilles tendon and was done for the season.\n\nOn July 16, 2013, \"The Washington Post\" reported that Cooley was retiring from the NFL. \"The Post\" further reported that Cooley would join the Washington Redskins' radio broadcast team as an analyst.\n\nCooley also co-hosted \"Cooley & Kevin\", a morning drive time sports show on ESPN 980 in D.

He also produces weekly film review segments on the Redskins' official website.\n\nOn August 11, 2015, it was reported that Cooley expressed interest into returning to the NFL after working out at the Redskins facility during the off season. Cooley never officially retired from the NFL after not being re-signed by the Redskins in 2013. After playing only with the Redskins throughout his entire career, he was afraid to tarnish his legacy by joining another team.\n\nOn September 29, 2015, Cooley attended a workout for the New York Giants.\n\nCooley resides in Hamilton, Virginia.\n\nThough he has previously attended The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he has not affiliated with that Church since at least 2004. He and his first wife Angela divorced in 2005. Later that year, he started dating Redskinnette (Redskin cheerleader) Christy Oglevee. She was fired for fraternizing with Redskins players, which the Redskins organization prohibits. They married on May 23, 2008 in Landsdowne, Virginia. In January 2012 they separated and in September they announced their intent to divorce.\n\nCooley's first child, daughter Sloane, was born on September 11, 2014.\n\nCooley, frequently referred to by his nickname \"Captain Chaos,\" is known for his eccentric hair styles, affinity for heavy metal music, and what one reporter has called an \"\"Animal House\" persona\". This nickname was created when teammates bet him he would not go out to the opening coin toss and introduce himself to the opposing team captains as \"Captain Chaos\". Cooley did so and the nickname stuck.\n\nCooley maintains his own blog, \"The Cooley Zone.\" On Sunday, September 14, 2008, Cooley posted on his blog a photo of Redskins training materials that also included his genitals. The picture remained on his site all day Sunday until it was finally removed. Cooley apologized and referred to the incident as \"a complete accident\", claiming that he initially posted the photo without realizing it showed his genitals. He at one time maintained an online store through eBay, featuring jerseys, cards, and other personalized memorabilia. Cooley is an avid trading card collector, a hobby he rediscovered while searching for Chris Cooley football cards.\n\nCooley is executive producer of the independent film \"Ghosts Don't Exist\", which began production in May 2009. He was featured in an episode of \"Jake and Amir\" for the comedy website CollegeHumor.\n\nCooley majored in art at Utah State, and now pursues a side career as a potter. He owns an art gallery in Leesburg.\n\nCooley made several appearances in TV commercials for Easterns Automotive Group, a local car dealership group on the DC and Baltimore areas, alongside Clinton Portis, Antwaan Randle El, Sean Taylor and Jason Campbell.\n\n\n"}

A student and a colleague of Sigmund Freud, he was the earliest exponent of psychoanalytical concepts with regard to clinical psychosis and the personality of the artist.\n\nTausk was born as son of a jewish journalist. He had been a lawyer and writer when he began to study medicine in Vienna around 1910. He joined the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and soon began to contribute papers.\nIn 1900 he converted from Judaism to Protestantism. During the First World War, he was recruited as a military doctor. The originality of his contribution to military medicine is contained in his theories on psychoses and his understanding of the phenomenon of desertion (Tréhel, G., 2006). Building up on his war experience, he wrote on war-induced psychoses while the other psychoanalysts were working on war neurosis. He took part in the debate on the disorder within the Society (Tréhel, G., 2011).\n\nIn 1919, after he had stepped out from Freud's shadow, Tausk published a paper on the origin of a delusion common to a wide array of schizophrenic patients, namely that an alien device, malignant and remote, had influenced their thoughts and their behavior. This device was referred to as \"the Influencing Machine\" and the paper was called \"On the Origin of the \"Influencing Machine\" in Schizophrenia\". It is the most well known of his publications, reaching beyond his own field of research into others, such as literary theory, for example. This work influenced many later theorists of psychoanalysis, including Heinz Kohut in his book \"Analysis of the Self\" where narcissistic regression showed great similarities with psychotic fantasmatic configurations.\n\nHis many other works include \"On Masturbation\" and \"The Psychology of the War Deserter\", all of which have generated much controversy and discussion, arguably due to his experience within the psychoanalytic community. However, Paul Roazen has argued that Tausk's legacy is still ongoing, and that his influence has not been properly acknowledged by the psychological, or psychoanalytical communities.\n\nOn the morning of July 3, 1919, after Helene Deutsch had stopped Tausk's treatment after Freud had demanded it, and after a complicated relation with Freud and Lou Andreas-Salomé, Tausk committed suicide by tying a curtain braid around his neck, then placing a pistol against his right temple and firing, hanging himself as he fell.\n\nFreud wrote to Salomé that \"\"I confess that I do not really miss him; I had long realised that he could be of no further service; indeed that he constituted a threat to the future.\"\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He published books on many areas of Turkish life, cookery, and history, as well as a life of Atatürk, and a universally admired autobiography (\"Portrait of a Turkish Family\", 1950). He also wrote two educational books for children.\n\nEducated at Kuleli Military High School, Harbiye Staff College, and Eskişehir Air College (1919–1933), Orga was born into a wealthy Ottoman Turkish family in Istanbul. Soon, with the outbreak of World War I, his life was changed forever. His father Hüsnü died on the way to the Dardanelles, his uncle Ahmet in Syria. Orga witnessed at first hand not only the hardships of war, but also the Allied Occupation of Constantinople, the end of Ottoman Empire, and the birth of the modern Turkish republic.\n\nOrga opens his iconic memoirs with images of his childhood. He tells of his wealthy bourgeois family in Istanbul, Turkey, in the early 1900s. His mother, Şevkiye (1895–1940), is a young Balkan/Turkish beauty (aged fifteen at his birth). His father runs his own business. He describes his autocratic grandmother as an eccentric socialite.\n\nIn 1942/43, while he was in the UK on a three-year diplomatic posting from the Turkish Air Force, he met a young married Norman-Irish woman, Margaret Veronica Gainsboro \"née\" D'Arcy-Wright (1919 [?1914]-1974). Since living with a foreigner was then a military offence in Turkey, Orga, having resigned his commission in early 1947, eventually fled the country for the UK, arriving in London just before the Christmas of that year (\"in absentia\", he was convicted and fined in an Ankara court in September 1949). He never returned. Once Margaret's divorce had been finalised in January 1948, they married.\n\nIn the UK, Orga sought various menial jobs, unsuccessfully, turning eventually to writing in 1949. \"Portrait of a Turkish Family\" received exceptional reviews from critics including John Betjeman, Harold Nicolson, Arthur Anderson, Barbara Worsley-Gough and Peter Quennell. His wife joined the publishers Secker & Warburg in 1957, later being appointed editor at W H Allen in the early 1960s.\n\nOrga tells his stories with multiple layers of complexity. He quickly makes clear his changing environment, with the death of his grandfather, the main provider of two generations of his family and their servants. His father, being a worldly man, understands that war is imminent. He proposes that his family sell their hereditary home in Istanbul, and move to another less expensive place, outside the city. However, reluctance is voiced. Orga captures the fear that a man can be suddenly in charge of a large group of people who depend on him for their survival.\n\nOrga was well-travelled, and wrote about his experiences. \"The Caravan Moves On\" (1958, Book Society Recommendation) is a story about the Yoruk nomads of the Taurus mountains in southeastern Turkey. An earlier title, \"Cooking with Yogurt\". was the first book in post-war Britain to specifically promote yogurt and its properties.\n\nAteş Orga, the writer and record producer, sums up his father as \"a gentle and kind person, a man of wisdom and sensitivity, of psychology and perception, a man of honour [...] a dreamer, a questioner, a lover of life's spirit [...] the fortress of our existence [...] a good human being\".\n\n\n\n"}

The U.S. 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was also a major contributor, by leading the attack Iraq's Adnan Motorized Division was also a participant. Medina Ridge is the name American troops gave to a low rise, approximately seven miles (11 km) long.\n\nThe battle, which was waged over approximately two hours, was considered by some sources the largest tank battle of the war. It took place west of Phase Line Kiwi, east of Phase Line Smash, and north of Phase Line Grape. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometers used to measure progress of an offensive operation.\n\nThe 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 M1A1 Abrams tanks. The 1st Armored Division's Cavalry Squadron—1-1 Cavalry—made contact with the Medina Division and informed the Division Commander of the location of the enemy forces. 1st Armored Division's 2nd Brigade (comprising three battalions TF 4-70th Armor, TF 2-70th Armor and TF 1-35th Armor) saw major action in this battle and was commanded by Colonel Montgomery Meigs (a descendant of General Montgomery C. Meigs of Civil War fame) 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel James Riley replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade for the duration of the war and was also heavily involved in the battle.\n\nMedina Ridge was one of the few battles during Desert Storm in which American forces encountered significant Iraqi resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. The Iraqi forces were well-deployed such that they could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridgeline. This reverse slope position was intended to give the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the M1 Abrams tanks and the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. \n\nDuring the battle the American forces destroyed 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly T-72Ms, Asad Babils and obsolete Type 69s) and 127 armored vehicles. Only four Abrams tanks were hit by direct fire. Evidence suggests that some of them were hit by Iraqi T-72 fire. Ballistics reports have further confirmed this as well as physical evidence such as obvious sabot holes. All four were lost. Thirty-eight of the Iraqi tanks were destroyed by U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches and U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. The 75th Field Artillery Brigade and Battery B, 25th Field Artillery, the division's target acquisition battery, conducted counterartillery fire missions and destroyed two Medina Field Artillery battalions in the process. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Field Artillery Regiment also eventually participated in these counterbattery missions. \n\nOn 25 February, the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division conducted a 113km movement to contact to destroy elements of the 26th Infantry Division resulting in the capture of 299 Prisoners of War. On February 26, the 3rd Brigade was ordered to attack east to gain contact with and destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command in zone. The 3rd Brigade began an aggressive and continuous movement to contact which covered 74 km in 12 hours, while fighting multiple engagements throughout the day and night with elements of the 52nd Armored Division, 17th, Adnan, and Tawakalna Divisions. During one engagement with the Tawakalna Division the Brigade destroyed 27 Soviet export model T-72 tanks which had established a hasty defense to cover the Iraqi forces withdrawing from the Kuwaiti Theater of Operation. \n\nAs the heaviest Armor Brigade, consisting of the 6th Battalion, 6th Infantry; the 1st Battalion, 35th Armor; the 2nd Battalion, 70th Armor; the 4th Battalion, 70th Armor; the 2nd Battalion, 1st Field Artillery and the 47th Support Battalion (Forward), the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division acted as the lead brigade during combat operations. On 27 February, the 2nd Brigade was fully engaged with the Medina's 2nd Brigade and, in the largest single engagement of the war, destroyed 61 Iraqi T-72/T-55 tanks, 34 APCs and five SA-13 air defense systems in less than one hour. \n\nOn 27 February, the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to transition to pursuit operations to establish contact with and destroy the RGFC forces in zone. As the Brigade attacked and fought through the Adnan Division, securing a RGFC major logistics base, it captured 465 POWs and made contact with the Medina Armored Division, which was augmented by elements of four other Iraqi divisions. A fierce battle ensued culminating in the destruction of 82 tanks, 31 Armored Personnel Carriers, 11 artillery pieces, 48 trucks, 3 AAA guns and captured 72 POWs for the loss of 2 Bradley Cavalry vehicles, 1 soldier killed, and 30 soldiers wounded. \nWhile conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division fought on the Division's right flank as it led the VII Corps main attack against the RGFC. Completing the destruction of the RGFC Brigade, the 3rd Brigade rejoined the Division transitioned to pursuit operations and continued its attack eastward. Executing an aggressive and continuous movement, the 3rd Brigade fought numerous engagements. The Brigade made contact with a tank battalion defending the western flank of a RGFC's major logistics base. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division raced eastward at a rate of 15 kilometres per hour. In 24 hours of nearly continuous combat, the 3rd Brigade destroyed or captured 547 vehicles, including 102 tanks, 81 armored personnel carriers, 34 artillery pieces, 15 AAA guns and captured hundreds of tons of supplies and 528 POWs. The 3rd Brigade completed this exemplary action without the loss of a single soldier or vehicle and only three soldiers WIA. \n\n1st Armored Division's aviation assets conducted thirty-nine straight hours of continuous combat operations, rotating companies into and out of the battle prior to and after the actions at Medina Ridge. Attack helicopters maintained a steady destructive presence in front of the Division, engaging targets of opportunity and rapidly shifting their focus and combat power as the scenario required. The Brigade's final battle commenced when the Division raced to clear its zone of advance to the Kuwaiti border prior to the impending cease-fire. \n\nAlthough the Iraqis used a correct defensive tactic by deploying their armor behind the ridge, this was not properly repeated through the rest of the war. In one incident, an Iraqi commander attempted to repeat what had been done at Medina but mistakenly deployed his armor too far from the ridgeline. This gave the American units the upper hand, as the Abrams tanks specialize in long-distance kills; their Chobham armor is extremely resistant to long-range fire. The American height advantage also reduced the effective range of the Iraqi tanks and presented the Iraqi gunners with a targeting situation for which they were under-trained. \n\nNevertheless, the Iraqis had fought hard, shooting down an A-10 Thunderbolt II,and two AH-64 Apache helicopters.\nMost of the units belonging to the 1st Armored Division and the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division were awarded Valorous Unit Award Citations. \n\nIn early April 1991, Colonel Montgomery Meigs, the commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division, paid his respects to his former enemy's Medina Division reporting that, \"\"These guys stayed and fought.\"\" The same newspaper articles notes that, \"\"The Americans had more than 100 battle tanks on hand, about the same as the total number of tanks in the Iraqi force. But the Americans had some noteworthy advantages over the Iraqis like attack helicopters and A-10 anti-tanks planes. The Iraqis had no support aircraft.\"\"\n\nIn a short six-month period during 1990 and 1991, the 1st Battalion, 37th Armor, was alerted for deployment to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, deployed all of its personnel and equipment over from an already forward deployed location, fought a major battle against a well equipped enemy over terrain they had never trained on and then redeployed the unit to its home station.\n\nThe 1st Battalion 37th Armor (1st Armored Division) from Rose Barracks, Vilseck, Germany, commanded by LTC Edward L. Dyer, was alerted for deployment to the Persian Gulf on 8 November 1990. 1–37 Armor was the first brigade unit from Vilseck to deploy. 1–37 Armor was attached to the 3rd \"Bulldog\" Brigade from Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany, under their former commander, Colonel Daniel Zannini. A small advance party deployed on 14 December and the main body began departing on 26 December. By 30 December, the battalion had arrived in Saudi Arabia. Vehicles and equipment which had been shipped from ports in Europe began to arrive on 4 January and by 12 January all the equipment had arrived. When hostilities commenced on 15 January 1991, the battalion was in the process of closing the last elements into TAA Thompson. The next month was spent task organizing, training, rehearsing, and preparing for the ground war.\n\nOn 24 February, Task Force 1–37 crossed the line of departure as part of VII Corps' attack against Iraqi forces. On 25 February, the battalion attacked and seized the division headquarters of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division destroying four armored vehicles, eight air defense weapons and captured over forty Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW). After attacking all day on 26 February, TF 1–37, part of 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, made contact with a brigade of the Tawakalna Armored Division of the Republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) which had established a defensive position to protect the flank of the RGFC and facilitate their escape from Kuwait. After a thirty-minute fire fight, TF 1–37 was ordered to assault the enemy position. The assault, conducted at night, in driving rain, resulted in the destruction of twenty-six T-72 tanks, 47 armored personnel carriers (mostly BMP's) and a handful of other vehicles, as well as the capture of over one hundred EPWs. TF 1–37 suffered the loss of four M1A1 tanks destroyed and six personnel wounded in action. After consolidation and reorganization, the task force continued the attack throughout the night of 26–27 February, reestablishing contact with the RGFC at approximately 0530, 27 February. The task force continued to attack, fighting numerous engagements with elements of multiple Iraqi divisions throughout the 27th and into the morning of the 28 February. At 0800 local time, 28 February, the task force established a hasty defensive position astride the Iraq-Kuwait border. During the last 28 hours of the attack, TF 1–37 destroyed an additional thirty-one tanks, thirty-one BMPs, numerous other APCs, air defense weapons and trucks, and captured over 200 EPWs.\n\nFour days after the cease fire, TF 1–37 moved nine miles (14 km) further into Kuwait. Two missions were conducted to destroy additional enemy weapons, ammunition and equipment, bury enemy remains, and to recover the four M1A1's which had been destroyed on 26 February.\n\nOn 24 March, TF 1–37 moved back into Iraq and established a defensive position in the vicinity of the Rumayilah oil fields. For the next three weeks, task force missions centered on refugee assistance and security operations. On 10 April, TF 1–37 began movement to the Rear Assembly Area (RAA) in the vicinity of King Khalid Military City (KKMC), Saudi Arabia. By 13 April, the task force had closed into the RAA and preparations began for the redeployment of the unit to Germany.\n\nOn 16 August 1991 the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division was redesignated as the 3d Brigade, 3d Infantry Division.\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division distinguished itself by gallantry in action from 26 to 28 February 1991, while conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command during operation DESERT STORM. As the heaviest Armor Brigade, consisting of the 6th Battalion, 6th Infantry; the 1st Battalion, 35th Armor; the 2nd Battalion, 70th Armor; the 4th Battalion, 70th Armor; the 2nd Battalion, 1st Field Artillery and the 47th Support Battalion (Forward), the 2nd Brigade led the first Division in the largest tank battle against the Republican Guard Forces Command. Throughout the entire operation, the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, demonstrated tenacity, esprit de corps, and courageous professionalism. The actions of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Army.\n\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored division distinguished itself by gallantry in action from 24 to 28 February 1991, while conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) during Operation DESERT STORM. The Brigade fought on the Division's right flank as it led the VII Corps main attack against the RGFC. Completing the destruction of the RGFC Brigade, the 3rd Brigade rejoined the Division transitioned to pursuit operations and continued its attack eastward. Executing an aggressive and continuous movement, the 3rd Brigade fought numerous engagements. The Brigade made contact with a tank battalion defending the western flank of a RGFC's major logistics base. Attacking with all three Battalions on line, the enemy vaporized in front of the Brigade, ten armored vehicles destroyed in the first minute of the battle. The Brigade's relentless attack continued throughout the day and into the night as it raced eastward at a rate of 15 kilometers per hour. In 24 hours of nearly continuous combat, the Brigade destroyed or captured 547 vehicles, including 102 tanks, 81 armored personnel carriers, 34 artillery pieces, 15 AAA guns and captured hundreds of tons of supplies and 528 EPWs. The Brigade completed this exemplary action without the loss of a single soldier or vehicle and only three WIAs. Through their demonstrated courage, tenacity, esprit de corps and professionalism, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division actions reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Army.\n\n\nFor exceptionally meritorious service as the Advanced Guard Brigade of the 1st Armored Division during offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) during Operation Desert Storm from 24 to 28 February 1991. As an attached Brigade consisting of 1/7th Infantry, 4/7th Infantry, 4/66th Armor, 1/1st Cavalry, 2/41st Field Artillery, 16th Engineer Battalion, and 26th Forward Support Battalion, the 3d Brigade led the 1st Armored Division and VII Corps main attack against the RGFC. On 25 February, the Brigade conducted a 113km movement to contact to destroy elements of the 26th Infantry Division resulting in the capture of 299 Enemy Prisoners of War (EPWs). On February 26, the Brigade was ordered to attack east to gain contact with and destroy the RGFC in zone. The 3d Brigade began an aggressive and continuous movement to contact which covered 74km in 12 hours, while fighting multiple engagements throughout the day and night with elements of the 52d, 17th, Adnan, and Tawakalna Divisions. During one engagement with the Tawakalna Division the Brigade destroyed 27 Soviet T-72s which had established a hasty defense to cover the Iraqi forces withdrawing from the Kuwaiti Theater of Operation.

Through their demonstrated tenacity, Esprit de Corps, and courageous professionalism, the units of the 3rd Phantom Brigade have brought great credit upon themselves, the 3rd Infantry Division and the United States Army.\n\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division distinguished itself by gallantry in action against an armed enemy during Operation DESERT STORM from 23 to 28 February 1991. The Brigade conducted combat operations to ascertain enemy dispositions along the Division's zone of advance. The Brigade's aircraft conducted continuous flight operations as the Division's movement to contact accelerated into Iraq. Time and again the attack helicopters were employed against Iraqi armored elements forward of the Division's ground forces. The Brigade conducted thirty-nine straight hours of continuous combat operations, rotating companies into and out of the battle. Because of their integration into the Division's close fight, the destruction of the Medina and Adnan Divisions was assured. Attack helicopters maintained a steady destructive presence in front of the Division, engaging targets of opportunity and rapidly shifting their focus and combat power as the scenario required. The Brigade's final battle commenced when the Division raced to clear its zone of advance to the Kuwaiti border prior to the impending cease-fire. The Brigade completed its combat operations without suffering the loss of any aircraft, vehicles or personnel. Through their expertise, tenacity, and courage, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division actions reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Army.\n\n\nThe Battle of Medina Ridge is recognized as the largest tank battle of the Gulf War by some sources. Other sources put it second behind the Battle of Norfolk.\n\n\n"}

Although the novel itself is not directed against state \"per se\" and a number of points underlined are true of modern-day bureaucracy and science, it met with a cold reaction during Soviet times and was quite difficult to obtain, therefore achieving a \"forbidden fruit\" status.\n\nThe novel exists in two slightly different variants - \"Smena\" and \"Angara\", by the names of the magazines in which they were published. They differ by characters and some plot lines and was caused by Angara editorial request to fit the novel for the magazine volume. \n\nOne version can be considered a more direct sequel to \"Monday Begins on Saturday\", at the end of which the main character is told he will be sent to Kitezhgrad for a business trip, and that is where this version of \"Tale of the Troika\" takes place.

{"id": "2048381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048381", "title": "Golden Bull of 1222", "text": "Golden Bull of 1222\n\nThe Golden Bull of 1222 was a golden bull, or edict, issued by Andrew II of Hungary. King Andrew II was forced by his nobles to accept the Golden Bull (Aranybulla), which was one of the first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch. The Golden Bull was issued at the year 1222 diet of Fehérvár. The law established the rights of the Hungarian nobility, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (\"jus resistendi\"). The nobles and the church were freed from all taxes and could not be forced to go to war outside of Hungary and were not obligated to finance it. This was also a historically important document because it set down the principles of equality for all of the nation's nobility. Seven copies of the edict were created, one for each of the following institutions: to the Pope, to the Knights Templar, to the Knights Hospitaller, to the Hungarian king itself, to the chapters of Esztergom and Kalocsa and to the palatine.\n\nThe charter's creation was influenced by the emergence of a nobility middle class, unusual in the nation's feudal system. As a regular gesture of generosity, King Andrew often donated property to particularly faithful servants, who thereafter gained new economic and class power. With the nation's class system and economic state changing, King Andrew found himself coerced into decreeing the Golden Bull of 1222 to relax tensions between hereditary nobles and the budding middle class nobility.\n\nThe Golden Bull is often compared to Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England.\n\nThe Golden Bull that Andrew II of Hungary issued in the spring of 1222 is \"one of a number of charters published in thirteenth-century Christendom that sought to constrain the royal power.\" Peter II of Aragon had already in 1205 planned to make concessions to his subjects. Simon de Montfort, supreme commander of the Albigensian Crusade, issued the Statute of Pamiers in 1212, confirming the privileges of the clergymen and limiting the authority of the future rulers of Toulouse and Carcassone. The statute influenced the Magna Carta of John, King of England, which also secured the liberties of the Church and regulated feudal relationships in 1215. The Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, strengthened the authority of the imperial prelates in 1220.\n\nContacts between Hungary and these countries can be demonstrated during this period. Aragonese nobles settled in Hungary in the early 13th century. Hungarian participants of the Fifth Crusade could meet Robert Fitzwalter and other leaders of the movement which had achieved the issue of the Magna Carta. Two Hungarian prelates visited Canterbury in 1220. However, no direct connection between the texts of the Golden Bull and other early 13th-century grants of liberties can be demonstrated. Historian James Clarke Holt says, there is no need to assume that the authors of these documents borrowed from each other, because all these charters embodied the \"natural reaction of feudal societies to monarchical importunity\".\n\nThe existence of at least a dozen distinct social groups can be documented in Hungary in the 12th and 13th centuries. Freemen and serfs were the two fundamental categories, but intermediate \"semi-free\" groups also existed. Freemen could in theory freely choose their lords, but they were in practice required to remain loyal to their masters. On the other hand, unfree warriors could hold large estates which were legally protected against arbitrary actions of royal officials.\n\nThe highest-ranking royal officials were appointed from among men who regarded themselves the descendants of either the Hungarian chieftains of the period of the establishment of the kingdom or of the foreign warriors who settled in Hungary during the subsequent centuries. They were mentioned as \"noblemen\" from the end of the 12th century, but they did not form a hereditary elite. The most prominent families started to name themselves after their forefathers in the 1200s, but their genealogies were often fabricated. The \"Gesta Hungarorum\", which was completed around 1200, emphasized that the ancestors of many noblemen played a preeminent role in the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin.\n\nInitially, each freeman was required to serve in the royal army. Those who were unable to perform this duty were obliged to pay taxes in the 12th century. The majority of the castle warriors were unfree, but freemen could also choose to serve the \"ispáns\" (or heads) of the royal castles. They were to defend the royal castles and accompany the monarchs to their military campaigns in exchange for the parcels they held in royal lands around the castles. Free castle warriors could also retain their own estates. The highest ranking castle warriors started to refer to themselves as \"freemen\" or \"warriors of the holy kings\" to emphasize their privileged status.\n\nThousands of foreignersSlavs, Germans, Italians and Walloonscame to Hungary to populate the sparsely inhabited lands or to work in the centers of royal administration. These \"guests\" preserved their personal freedom even if they settled in the estates of the aristocrats or churchmen. Jews could legally settle only in the centers of the bishoprics, but they actually also lived in other towns. They were primarily merchants, engaged in long-distance trade. Muslims who settled in Hungary were primarily employed in the administration of royal revenues, but the presence of Muslim warriors is also documented.\n\nBéla III of Hungary, who ruled from 1172 to 1196, was one of the wealthiest European monarchs of his time, according to a summary of his revenues. He earned income from the periodical exchange of coins, royal salt monopoly and customs duties, but significant part of his revenues came from the royal estates, because he owned more than half of landed property in the kingdom. He decreed that each transaction proceeding in his presence was to be recorded, which gave rise to the development of the royal chancellery. Thereafter private transactions were also frequently recorded and preserved at specific monasteries or cathedral chapters, known as \"places of authentication\".\n\nBéla III's eldest son and successor, Emeric, faced a series of rebellions initiated by his younger brother, Andrew. Both the king and his brother, who seized Croatia and Dalmatia, made generous grants to their partisans to secure their loyalty. Prelates and high-ranking officials supported Andrew against the king, but Emeric defeated his brother. Andrew mounted the throne after the sudden death of Emeric's infant son, Ladislaus III, in 1205.\n\nAndrew appointed his former supporters to the highest offices, but most of his brother's former officials could retain their offices, because he needed their assistance. For instance, four of Andrew's first seven palatinesCsépán Győr and his brother, Pat, Julius Kán and Bánk Bár-Kalánhad held offices already during Emeric's reign. The \"ispáns\" of Bács, Sopron, Zala and other important counties were mostly nominated from among Emeric's former supporters. The heads of the royal householdincluding the master of the horse and the master of the stewardsbecame the members of the royal council during Andrew's reign. He always appointed one of his old partisans to these new offices.\n\nAndrew started to grant large areas of royal estates and significant sums of money to his former supporters. For instance, Alexander of the Hont-Pázmány clan, who had helped Andrew to flee from his brother's prison, received 300 marks in 1217. Andrew's predecessors had also donated royal estates in perpetuity, but mostly those situated in the borderlands. Breaking with this practise, Andrew gave away large domains which were located in the central regions. The new policy of donations, known as \"novae institutiones\" (\"new arrangements\"), significantly reduced the revenues of the \"ispáns\" of the counties, because one third of all royal revenues from their counties were due to them. The \"new arrangements\" also diminished royal revenues. Andrew introduced new taxes and ordered the exchange of coins twice a year to secure the funds to the maintenance of his royal court. He farmed out the collection of the taxes and the administration of the royal mint to Jews and Muslims.\n\nAccording to a widespread scholarly theory, the appearance of wealthy landowners in the counties threatened the social position of both the free and unfree royal warriors. Lesser landowners started to emphasize their direct link to the monarch. According to the available sources, landowners from Hosszúhetény were the first to call themselves \"freemen and royal servants\" during a court case against the abbot of Pécsvárad Abbey in 1212. Andrew started to grant the same status from the 1210s. Royal servants were to serve in the royal army, but independently of the \"ispáns\" who were the commanders of the county troops.\n\nAndrew's \"new arrangements\" stirred up discontent among his subjects. A group of dignitaries made attempts to dethrone him in favor of his cousins in 1209. His wife, Gertrude of Merania, who had persuaded him to make generous grants to her German relatives and courtiers, was assassinated in 1213. He was forced to have his eight-year-old son, Béla, crowned king in 1214. After he left for a crusade to the Holy Land in 1217, his deputy, John, Archbishop of Esztergom, was expelled from Hungary. Andrew returned to Hungary in 1218. Shortly thereafter, his chancellery issued a series of charters which were dated as if he had started to reign in the spring of 1204, thus ignoring the last months of his brother's reign and the entire period of his nephew's rule. According to historian Attila Zsoldos, Andrew wanted to invalidate the royal charters which were issued during the eighteen months before his actual ascension to the throne.\n\nThe royal council ordered the revision of the grants concerning the estates of the \"udvornici\" (or semi-free peasants) in 1220. Next year, a similar decision was passed about the estates of the castle folk. Andrew was forced to appoint Béla to administer the lands beyond the Drava River in 1220. The noblemen who had lost Andrew's favor assembled in his son's new court.\n\nThe circumstances of the promulgation of the Golden Bull are uncertain because of the lack of sources. The Golden Bull itself is the principal source of the events which forced Andrew to issue it. Royal charters and Pope Honorius III's letters to Hungarian dignitaries provide further information about the political history of the year.\n\nOn 4 July 1222, the pope urged the Hungarian prelates to apply ecclesiastical censures against those who had claimed that they did not owe loyalty to Andrew, but to Béla.\n\nThe available data suggest that discontented noblemen, many of whom had held high offices during Emeric's reign, staged a coup in the spring of 1222.\n\nMore than one third of the articles of the Golden Bull dealt with the grievances of the royal servants. The king promised that neither the \"collecta\" (an extraordinary tax) nor the freemen's pennies (an ordinary tax) would be collected on their estates. He also pledged that he would not force them to accommodate him and his officials. Royal servants who had no sons were granted the right to freely dispose of their estates in their testaments. The Golden Bull limited the judicial power of the \"ispáns\", stating that in the royal servants' estates they could administer justice only in cases concerning the tithe and coinage. Royal servants were exempted of the obligation of accompanying the monarch to military expeditions to foreign lands.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2048408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048408", "title": "Presto card", "text": "Presto card\n\nThe Presto card (stylized as PRESTO) is a contactless smart card automated fare collection system used on participating public transit systems in the province of Ontario, Canada, specifically in Greater Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa. Presto card readers were implemented on a trial basis from June 25, 2007, to September 30, 2008. Full implementation began in November 2009 and it was rolled out across rapid transit stations, railway stations, bus stops and terminals, and transit vehicles on eleven different transit systems.\n\nA variant of the Presto card is the Presto ticket introduced on April 5, 2019, which is a single-use, paper ticket with an embedded chip. The Presto ticket can only be used for the services of the Toronto Transit Commission.\n\nOne of the 10 strategies of The Big Move, the GTHA's regional transportation plan, was to create an integrated transit fare system amongst the 10 public transit agencies in the GTHA. The Presto system was designed to support the use of one common method of fare payment on various participating public transit systems, comparable with other systems such as London's Oyster card and Hong Kong's Octopus card. Presto is an operating division of Metrolinx, the Ontario government agency that manages and integrates road transport and public transportation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA).\n\nIn 2002, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), in conjunction with GO Transit and GTHA municipalities, began investigating the merit of a regional fare card. In October 2006, the Ministry of Transportation signed a 10-year, $250-million contract with Accenture to design, develop and operate the base Presto system for the GTHA. Two major transit agencies, OC Transpo and the TTC, agreed to adopt the fare card system in 2007 and 2009 respectively. The larger anticipated userbase prompted the MTO to decide on developing a new system, called Presto Next Generation (PNG). Auditor General of Ontario criticized this move, suggesting that the base Presto system should have been expanded to accommodate OC Transpo and the Toronto Transit Commission.\n\nThales Group and Accenture were awarded the contract to supply this system in October 2009. Implementation is the responsibility of Metrolinx, of which Presto became an operating division in 2011.\n\nThe Presto project was strongly criticized by the Auditor General of Ontario in 2012 for \"roll-out glitches, cost escalations and untendered contract extensions\" and warned the system could become the world's most expensive fare-card implementation project. Instead of putting the development Presto Next Generation out to competitive tender, Metrolinx simply increased the size of the original base contract awarded to Accenture in 2006. By 2012, the cost of the system ballooned to $700million.\n\nThe Presto rollout on the TTC's surface transit fleet have been marred with abnormally high failure rates of the readers themselves and cost overruns. A TTC position paper noted that faulty Presto card readers used by fare inspectors on the proof-of-payment streetcar system is making it \"difficult to get customers to comply with inspections\" and costing the TTC in lost fare revenue.\n\nA June 3, 2017, story in the \"Toronto Star\" first reported that customers' Presto travel histories were provided to police authorities 12 times in the previous year, with a warrant having been required for only two of those disclosures and customers typically not having been notified that their records had been shared. The figures were confirmed by Metrolinx in later reports, stating that they had granted 12 of 26 requests received from various police agencies. In response to calls for reforming the data sharing system from experts and transit riding advocates, Metrolinx launched a formal review of its privacy policies.\n\nThe rollout of the fare system and accompanying replacement fare gates on the TTC's subway network was met with poor reliability and issues with processing transactions. Presto was forced to use its existing software back-end for other municipal transit partners that have completed the roll-out, as the TTC has yet to develop its own dedicated infrastructure to process the larger volume of transactions it typically handles. The new fare gates suffered from persistent mechanical and software problems, prompting the TTC to suspend the rollout for a month to work with the contractor, Scheidt & Bachmann, to resolve reliability issues. As a result, over 2,000 motors on more than 1,000 gates had to be replaced in addition to numerous hardware and software updates. The June 2018 deadline for the complete roll-out of Presto for the TTC will be further pushed to 2019 due to these ongoing issues, prompting a delay in the phasing out of cash fares, tokens and other legacy fare media. As a result, the TTC will face higher fare collection costs as it incurs \"transitional costs\" of operating parts of Presto and the legacy fare regimes concurrently over the next few years. A situation TTC board member John Campbell describes as \"totally inefficient\".\n\nIn its annual report released in 2018, Metrolinx indicated it expected the cost of the Presto system to reach $1.2billion, with $1billion already spent in the development and implementation the system between 2002 and March 2018. While Presto was designed for complex fare transactions between GTA transit agencies, up until the fourth quarter of 2019, the system on TTC buses was not able to support the payment of special surcharges for TTC express downtown buses and TTC trips that enter Mississauga and York Region where a Miway or YRT fare was required. , the TTC Presto system at large continues to experience abnormally high failure rates. This led to an estimated loss of at least $3.4 million in revenue in 2018 alone according to the TTC. The 2018 Audit Work Plan by the auditor general of Ontario noted that the number of reports of Presto collection machines not functioning properly is likely under-counted and a breakdown in communication between Metrolinx, the TTC, and two of its vendors led to operational issues. This included a finding that over half the \"out-of-service\" incidents raised for the fare vending machines on the TTC's new Flexity streetcars are \"coin or token box full\" errors, the root cause being miscommunication between the TTC and Metrolinx on coin and token collection leading to the vending machines not being emptied frequently enough. \n\nIn early 2018, Metrolinx detailed a plan to increase transit ridership by use of a mobile app (available for Android and iOS devices) which it released to the public for testing in beta version in late 2018. The app will eventually allow transit users to pay directly from their mobile device.\n\nPresto cards are available to purchase at most Shoppers Drug Mart stores, transit centres in the GTHA and Ottawa, over the phone and online. Beginning in Stage 3, cardholders will also be able to load passes for up to three transit systems at a time on to their Presto card. When boarding, riders tap the prepaid card, embedded with an RFID chip, on to a reader. The reader will then check for either a valid transit pass, or automatically deduct the lowest available fare from the card's balance stored in its e-purse (\"stored balance\"). GO Transit and Union Pearson Express riderswhose fares are calculated by distanceand those riding TTC buses which travel into the City of Mississauga or York Regionwhich require an extra fare to be paid when crossing the fare zone boundariesmust also tap their cards at the end of a trip. The readers can display one of several messages, depending on transit system and type of fare:\n\nLoyalty programs are also available on some transit systems, where frequent use of the system results in greater discounts on fare payment.\n\nThe Presto card works on several transit systems and has other features:\n\nA Braille letter \"P\" was placed on the Presto card to help distinguish it from other cards in a wallet, after consultation with feedback from visually impaired customers.\n\nPresto cards purchased from the Presto website or from automated self-service vending machines in TTC, GO Transit and UP Express stations are set to the adult fare rates. For concessionary fares (such as child, senior, youth or post-secondary student), one must present the Presto card at either a transit centre or at a Shoppers Drug Mart location with appropriate identification to have the concession fare rate set.\n\nThe following transit service providers use Presto:\n\nIn July 2007, 500 commuters who normally commuted from Meadowvale and Cooksville GO stations in Mississauga to Union Station in downtown Toronto received a free card and tried the system under a trial termed \"Launch 1\". Officials decided to test the fare system on Mississauga's neighbourhood shuttle service in Meadowvale and Cooksville that transports passengers to GO Transit. During the Launch 1 trial, the Presto card could be used at:\nThe Launch 1 trial concluded September 30, 2008.\n\nThe Presto card has been introduced in stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009.\n\nThe first stage of the production rollout schedule was launched on November 30, 2009 and included a limited number of recruited customers to test the system.\nStage One included Oakville, Bronte and Union GO Stations, TTC Union Subway Station, and ten Oakville Transit buses on three routes.\n\nThe second stage of the production rollout schedule was launched on May 10, 2010. In this stage, the Presto system became available to the general public and transit users were able to purchase Presto cards and use them at participating stations and transit systems. Stage Two was launched similarly to Stage One, but with full participation from Oakville Transit and Burlington Transit. GO Transit continued its system-wide rollout, with the Lakeshore East, Milton and Georgetown lines coming online at a rate of a few stations a week. The Toronto Transit Commission added six downtown stations (St. George, Queen's Park, St. Patrick, Dundas, College, Bloor/Yonge) to the Presto system. Two more stations (Kipling and Islington) were added in mid-2010. The third stage of the production rollout schedule was scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010 to bring more transit systems and stations into the Presto system.\n\nThe third stage of the rollout schedule expanded the rollout to a larger scale, covering the entire 905 region and Hamilton. GO Transit completed its rollout for trains and buses in mid-2012. Since then, all new GO Train stations and buses have had Presto readers on the first day of service.\n\nIn the end of this stage, all but two local transit systems had completed their rollout. Hamilton Street Railway was the first to roll out in this stage on May 3, 2011. Brampton Transit became fully Presto-enabled on May 30, 2011. On the same date, MiWay made the farecard available to adult passengers only. Durham Region Transit launched Presto card for co-fares with GO Transit on June 27, 2011. Almost a month later, York Region Transit launched the Presto card in all of its Vivastations and buses. The TTC added Presto card as fare payment option in Don Mills, Downsview, Finch, Yorkdale and York Mills subway stations. In this stage, concession fares were added for GO Transit, Oakville Transit, Burlington Transit, Brampton Transit, York Region Transit and MiWay; and co-fares for GO buses have been offered by MiWay and Brampton Transit exclusively for Presto cardholders. Also in this stage, only Durham Region Transit remains to roll out its regular fares.\n\nPresto's self-service kiosks debuted at Union Station for a pilot project during this period. Reception of the pilot kiosks was found to be favourable. The pilot kiosks have since been removed and a widespread rollout of automated reload systems is ongoing throughout GO, TTC, and Union Pearson Express stations.\n\nThe fourth stage of the rollout added Ottawa's OC Transpo, commencing as a soft launch in the second quarter of 2012 and as a full rollout on May 18, 2013. It is the only agency to receive the Presto card so far outside the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area. This stage involved the initial rollout of Presto Next Generation (PNG). OC Transpo's Presto readers are compatible with the Société de transport de l'Outaouais's new Multi farecards and Presto cards are compatible with pass readers on STO buses, thus facilitating transfers between the two.\n\nStage Four also marked the extensive rollout of the Presto fare system on the TTC, also using the Presto Next Generation system, while the participating transit systems that had already fully rolled out in the earlier stages were to receive Presto Next Generation cards late in the fourth quarter of 2012. Payment by other means, such as open payment and mobile payment systems, will also be made compatible with this updated version of Presto card.\n\nStage Four and Presto Next Generation had been criticized for numerous delays with launching OC Transpo service. Metrolinx set July 1, 2012 as the Presto launch date for Ottawa, but in June 2012, it was postponed to February 1, 2013. City staff decided to launch Presto in several stages for 2013, the last of which occurred on May 18, 2013.\n\nThe first major addition of Presto on the TTC took place in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the introduction of Presto card machines in several more Toronto subway stations, and the launch of new streetcars equipped with this system (see below).\n\n\nParticipating transit systems have different fares and fare policies when using the Presto card compared to traditional fare media; generally, passengers receive a discount using Presto compared to cash fares. The implementation of the Presto card has also unified the fare categories of GO Transit and local transit agencies, with local transit agencies adopting the GO Transit standard: local transit agencies used to have different age limits for child and senior fares and different types of students that may use student fares (some excluding post-secondary students while others do not). Registered Presto card holders are assessed the senior or child fares as appropriate. Student fare classification must be activated by the card-issuing transit authority through its normal procedures, which differ between transit systems. For example, post-secondary student fares are classified as students in only GO Transit and MiWay, while the rest classify them under the adult category.\n\nOther Presto card fare notes:\n\n\nLocal transit systems (except for the TTC and OC Transpo) within the Presto card's service area have always honoured transfers from neighbouring transit systems, and transferring between neighbouring transit systems continues to be honoured with the Presto Card where they were honoured with traditional fare media.\n\nOn most transit agencies, paper transfers are not required for Presto card users since the card itself acts as proof-of-payment (POP) which can also be used to transfer from vehicle to vehicle or vehicle to station (and vice versa) and/or to show enforcement officers on designated POP routes on which they carry hand-held devices to verify that payment was made (tapped on upon entry to the station or vehicle) except in the following cases:\n\nAs the Presto card is meant to replace paper transfers along with cash, tickets, tokens and paper passes, local transit operators have generally adopted the Presto card's transfer policies in their paper transfers (in the sense that, with the exception of the TTC and OC Transpo, all local transit operators accept each other's transfers, and will not reissue transfers originally issued by other local transit operators), except for a generally longer transfer window provided by the Presto card.\n\n\nA Presto ticket is a single-use, paper ticket with an embedded electronic chip. Like the Presto card, users must tap the Presto ticket on a Presto reader when entering a TTC bus, streetcar or subway station. Unlike the Presto card, the Presto ticket is valid only for TTC services; it cannot be used for any other regional service providers or on TTC bus routes operating outside of the City of Toronto, such as those in York Region (north of Steeles Avenue) and Mississauga (west of Pearson Airport). The Presto ticket is intended for infrequent TTC customers.\n\nThere are 3 types of Presto ticket: 1-ride, 2-ride and day pass. Customers can purchase up to 10 Presto tickets at a time from Presto fare vending machines at all TTC subway stations. Unlike Presto cards, Presto tickets do not support concession fares for seniors, students, youth or children. As with Presto cards, there is a 2-hour transfer period for 1- and 2-ride Presto tickets for TTC services. The Presto day pass expires at 2:59a.m. on the day following the ticket's first use.\n\nA Presto ticket is not reloadable and is meant to be discarded once the travel period has ended. Because of the embedded chip, the ticket is not recyclable. Presto tickets bought by individuals must be used within 90 days of purchase, although service agencies may purchase Presto tickets that can be used up to one year from purchase. All Presto tickets have an expiry date so as not to overload the central computer system that tracks all unexpired Presto tickets. Presto fare vending machines at subway stations have an inquiry feature to check whether a purchased Presto ticket is still valid.\n\n, Presto tickets are available for purchase at all TTC subway stations. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2048410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048410", "title": "Pride (comics)", "text": "Pride (comics)\n\nPride is a fictional supervillain team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters are depicted as a criminal organization that controlled the Los Angeles area of the Marvel Universe. As they are the parents and the initial and most prominent foes the Runaways have faced, they are perhaps the team's greatest enemy to date. The Pride consists of six couples—the mafia-controlling Wilders, the time-traveling Yorkeses, the telepathic mutant Hayeses, the alien invader Deans, the mad scientist Steins, and the dark wizard Minorus.\n\nPride was often considered to be an efficient super-villain team that barred other villains from controlling Los Angeles. Although the real world did not know of The Pride's existence, other mafia mob bosses who did, such as the Kingpin, admitted the group ran Los Angeles with efficiency and vision. The Pride first appeared in \"Runaways #1\", published by Marvel Comics in 2003, and were created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona.\n\nPride also appeared in the Hulu television series \"Runaways\", where most of them are presented as caring parents who act out of a desire to protect their children from a greater threat.\n\nAlthough Pride were the center of focus throughout the first volume of the series, their actual origin was only covered in the 13th issue. The six couples were called together in 1985 by the Gibborim, three mythical giants who had ruled the world when it had \"originally been one, serene utopia\". The Gibborim informed the couples (who revealed themselves to be aliens, time-travelers, magicians, scientists, mutants, and criminals) that they desired to turn the world into the same peaceful utopia it had been millions of years before, but did not have the strength. The Gibborim required the six couples' help (\"a Pride\") to wipe out the entire planet, and when they achieved their goal, six of the twelve who served them the best would be able to rule the world with them, while the other six would perish with the rest of the human race. The couples agreed, and formed The Pride.\n\nThe Gibborim required a sacrifice every year for twenty-five years in order to get their strength. During this time, the Gibborim rewarded The Pride with wealth and with enhancements to their natural abilities and powers so they could rule over Los Angeles, to a point where Norman Osborn calls them \"the dominant and most feared criminal organization of the West Coast\". Every year, The Pride gathered at the Wilder residence, using the excuse of an \"annual charity fundraiser\", while in reality, they would perform the \"Rite of Blood\", the ritual sacrifice of an innocent young female victim; the spirit of the victim would then be fed to the Gibborim in the \"Rite of Thunder\".\n\nAfter Janet Stein became pregnant during their third year as Pride, Pride agreed to end its struggle against one another. Instead of half the couples surviving, they would instead have one child, with those children receiving the six places in the coming paradise, allowing Pride's legacy to go on. Unbeknownst to the rest of Pride, the Deans and the Hayes had made a deal: to murder the rest of Pride and take the six tickets to paradise for themselves and their daughters, Karolina Dean and Molly Hayes, considering themselves superior to the other four families due to their natural abilities compared to the others' reliance on technology and tools.\n\nWhen Obadiah Stane took his company, Tony Stark relocated to Los Angeles after saving a homeless man with psychological problems, but unintentionally attracted the attention of Pride who believed that he had come to Los Angeles specifically to confront them. Despite their attempts to eliminate Stark by hiring the Serpent Society to kill him, Tony was able to assemble a new company called Imperio Techworks, convincing the locals to invest (with the new Iron Man acquiring Japanese investors after defeating a monster), which prompts Wilder to send Tony a message about his presence in the city, unintentionally exposing the Pride. Only aware that the Serpent Society had been sent after him by a bald man, Tony had assumed their attacks against him were organized by Stane. Although he was able to defeat and imprison Pride with the aid of the Illuminati when they tried to confront him directly, knowing that he couldn't hold his \"territory\" once Pride were out of prison as they were too well-connected, Tony handed Imperio Techworks over to one of his employees and departed after leaving Geoffrey Wilder a message, if Pride left Imperio alone, Tony would not bring in virtually every superhuman contact he possessed to attack them.\nSeventeen years later, Pride's children inadvertently see the Rite of Blood and run away. With assistance of LAPD Lieutenant Flores, their parents frame their children for the murder of the innocent girl who served as their most recent sacrifice. A note left at the Deans' house reveals that one of the Runaways is secretly loyal to Pride. The mole within the Runaways tips off Pride about their involvement with Cloak and Dagger and alerts the Pride of their new hideout, forcing the Runaways to escape.\n\nDuring a ceremony at the Rite of Thunder, Alex obtains Nico's Staff of One, Chase's Fistigons and Gertrude's dinosaur (Old Lace), manipulating his teammates into defeat and revealing himself as the mole. In reality, he also discovered the Deans' and Hayeses' betrayal.\n\nAlex manipulated the Runaways as a way of taking the six tickets in paradise for himself, his parents, Nico and her parents. Nico brutally refuses his offer, beating up Alex in the process. Within seconds, the other Runaways retrieve their stolen items from Alex. Molly crushes the container carrying the soul of the latest girl sacrificed, the Gibborim destroy Alex, and the undersea lair in which they offer the soul collapses, trapping The Pride inside. Right before the lair collapses, the rest of Pride finally learns of the Deans and Hayeses betrayal.\n\nThe Runaways assume Pride is dead, even though no bodies were found.\n\nWith their defeat, the activities and the true extent of the Pride's influence in L.A. is reported to the public, leading to a slew of indictments, most notably within law enforcement ranging from theft to homicide. A news report three months later announces that the government is refusing to reveal any detail about Pride or the Runaways (who are now known to the public as Pride's children and vanquishers).\n\nAt the end of issue #6 in the second series, a figure who had impersonated Chamber from the X-Men, is implied to be a resurrected Alex Wilder, and has formed a new Pride using some of the original team's tools, including the Minorus' Chameleon Glamour, a small talisman to disguise the user into any form. They had later used the Minorus' Eye-Spy Cauldron to spy on the Runaways, who had left from New York City and were returning to Los Angeles. They had also obtained the Steins' copy of the Abstract. It was later revealed that they were a group of Alex's former online friends on a role-playing game consisting of Stretch, Hunter, Lotus, and Oscar.\n\nIt was later revealed they were the \"new Pride\". Hunter hacked into Alex's game account, and through that eventually found his computer's journal and learned about Pride. After Alex's death, the friends find certain items from Pride in an attempt to bring back Alex, but end up killing Oscar, and bringing back a younger version of Alex's father Geoffrey from a time period of one year after joining Pride. Geoffrey then lied to the new Pride acting as the \"good guy\" and saying that the Runaways killed Alex. Ironically, the new Pride formed because Alex's friends claimed that they wanted to become more \"responsible members of society\", and begin acting like adults, the Runaways' philosophy states that no adults are to be trusted.\n\nGeoffrey Wilder murders Gertrude Yorkes as part of a sacrificial ritual, but he is captured and returned to his own time (with his memory erased in the process) the new Pride disbands after the Runaways reveal Geoffrey Wilder's true goal. Following Gert's death, Stretch checks himself into a mental health facility, and Hunter joins the Peace Corps to atone for the \"blood\" on his hands. Lotus is kidnapped (or, as she puts it, \"hired\") by Chase Stein to help him resurrect Gert. When the attempt fails, Chase releases Lotus, telling her to burn her copy of the Abstract.\n\nAlex Wilder starts a third incarnation of Pride where he has gotten known Harlem crime lords Black Mariah, Cottonmouth, Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton, Gamecock and some unnamed people to join him. Alex later approached Tombstone and Mr. Fish where he tells them about his father's group and that he is starting a new incarnation of Pride in Harlem. Afterwards, Alex beats up Tombstone and banishes Mr. Fish to Hell.\n\nDespite Pride's allegiance to one another, rifts and alliances had been common amongst the group; indeed, the most notable of the alliance was the Hayeses and Deans, who had plotted to betray the other remaining Pride members because they were human. All members of the Pride are given nicknames by the Gibborim.\n\nGeoffrey and Catherine Wilder (\"the Thieves\") are Alex Wilder's parents. They are crime bosses who posed as businesspeople. They handled illegal drug trade, gambling and robbery in Los Angeles. For this, these two established strong and powerful connections throughout Los Angeles, a reason the Pride is able to frame their kids for kidnap and murder. Geoffrey had led the entire Pride. Geoffrey originally appeared as a stern, demeaning man, who had forbidden his son from playing online roleplaying games. His cool persona is often distinguished, meaning other characters can detect his attitude, as evidenced when Nico is able to identify a 1985 version of Geoffrey. When the Gibborim had called them to the first meeting, Geoffrey and Catherine had been on the run from the cops, after a fresh robbery, where it was revealed that Geoffrey and Catherine had eloped, defying Catherine's mother's wishes. Originally appearing as average parents, it is shown the two can also have short tempers; when one of the Pride's agents informed Geoffrey that their children had run away, Geoffrey carried a dagger to Alex's room; Catherine later shot the same agent in the knee.\n\nGeoffrey Wilder later returns, after a group unintentionally brings a 1985 version of him back from his time. He was later defeated, and returned to his time with his memory wiped by Nico.\n\nDale and Stacey Yorkes (\"the Travelers\") are Gertrude Yorkes's parents. They are time travellers who posed as antique dealers. The two, using a special 4-D portal, traveled all over time, and had commissioned a genetically-engineered dinosaur, mentally linking it with their daughter. They had lived in the 87th century. When the Gibborim had called them to the first meeting, Dale and Stacey had accidentally landed in 1985, where Stacey quotes was \"the worst decade of the century\". They believed the Gibborim would make a better world, one that wasn't full of superheroes who had foiled their plans in the past (and presumably the future). The two have a distinct way of speech (unlike the rest of the Pride, they have older-fashioned speech), and often imply they know what will go on in the future. They dress in pilot styles resembling that of Amelia Earhart, complete with the goggles, scarves, and gloves. It was later revealed their outfits were actually technical advances; their gloves cause fire and restraining shields. The Yorkes appear as self-righteous, obnoxious people, particularly Stacey. Gert had had a strong dislike of her parents because of an incident involving Gert's pet pig, which the Yorkes hated; after Gert had been playing with it, she had briefly left to answer the phone, and when she returned, she found it gone. She suspected her parents of the disappearance.\n\nWhen the runaways are time-displaced to 1907, it was revealed the runaways had landed in a time the Yorkes were visiting, where the Yorkes are the heads of a super powered street gang known as the Sinners. When Chase reveals Gert is dead to Dale, he snaps, prompting him to almost assault Chase with his fiery gloves. Later on, Dale reveals the Yorkes have several kingdoms through time, and plan on destroying all of 1907 New York for the sake of their daughter. Unable to wipe their memories as she had already used that spell, Nico stops the Yorkes with her most complex spell yet (\"The show must go on\"), revealing a painful secret about the Yorkes: the Yorkes will remember everything they now know about their daughter's upcoming death as well as their own, but are enchanted to be unable to act on this knowledge in any way, even to each other; they cannot change the future or say anything that would cause a Grandfather Paradox.\n\nFrank and Leslie Dean (\"the Colonists\") are Karolina Dean's parents. They are alien invaders from Majesdane (the homeworld of their race) who posed as Hollywood actors. The Deans are intergalactic arms traders to the Skrulls. In their alien form, they appear humanoid with bright, wispy skin, and can manipulate and control solar energy for a variety of purposes. When the Gibborim had called the Deans for the first meeting, the Deans were on a Hollywood set for their show, \"General Hospital\". The two had inhibited Karolina's alien powers for most of her life by way of a medical alert bracelet that was forged from far-distant metal, telling her she had an allergy to penicillin. Frank had included Karolina in his will with a paper instructing her to take off the bracelet, but Karolina had discovered the will early. Frank and Leslie had originally appeared as a happy, smiling couple that complimented Karolina's special powers, but as issues went on, it was shown the two would have violent and warlike tempers; when the runaways battle their parents over Molly Hayes, Leslie appears rather viciously, returning every time she was knocked out; when Frank arrived from New York and discovered his daughter had already left home and discovered her powers, he had violently attacked Victor Stein roaring for his daughter. The Deans also were the only ones that didn't want a child. However, Leslie eventually believed that a child would put them on \"People\" magazine's cover. The Deans had conspired with the Hayeses to kill the rest of the Pride and take the six tickets in paradise for the two couples and their daughters.\n\nWhen on the run, Karolina meets Xavin, an alien, and more about the Deans is revealed: the Deans had actually been exiled from their planet for criminal activities; the two immigrated to Earth where they took their last name from a memorial of James Dean. When Prince De'zean of the Skrulls had arrived at Earth to conquer it, Frank and Leslie had stopped him. In exchange, the two gave the Skrulls the coordinates of a much more valuable planet: \"Majesdane\", the Deans' birth planet, which was hidden beneath a white dwarf star. To assure the Skrulls the coordinates were real, the Deans offered the prince their daughter's hand in marriage; therefore, Karolina was engaged to the son of the prince, Xavin. The Skrulls then left to destroy Majesdane, culminating in a fifteen-year war. The Deans had privately believed that Xavin would die in the war and wouldn't come to collect the marriage agreement. More recently, Karolina had a dream involving both her parents; in a split image, Leslie pulled Karolina to Earth, while Frank pulled Karolina to a milky ball that was Majesdane. It was later revealed by vaDanti, a Majesdanian soldier, that it was specifically Frank Dean who told the Skrulls where Majesdane was hidden.\n\nDaken, the psychopathic son of Wolverine, invades Los Angeles with the hope of usurping the void left by the Pride. He begins taking drugs that are mixed with Majesdanian blood, referred to as \"Heat Pills\" but unaware it's costing him his abilities.\n\nVictor and Janet Stein (\"the Wise Men\") are Chase Stein's parents. They are world-renowned brilliant inventors (Tony Stark was once impressed by their work) who are known for making fortunes for what people believe are necessities. They also made \"weaponized\" gloves called Fistigons, multi-spectral goggles and the transport ship \"the Leapfrog\". When the Gibborim had called them for the first meeting, the Steins were in their laboratory. At the back of the Stein home is their workshop, which appears as a small shed. When entered, the space is equal to that of a large cave. The Steins are also responsible for the money the Pride obtains, as Victor revealed he and Janet had counterfeited the new fifty dollar bill within two minutes. The Steins have also created watches that zap electricity, watches that scan police radars and senses, creating the container that carries the soul they sacrifice, and they dress in scientific outfits for their villainous costumes. Janet Stein's pregnancy is the reason the remaining Pride wished to have children, and started the idea of offering their place to a child. Victor is the one parent often described as being the most abusive, as he first appears punching Chase across the face for getting C's, with Janet scolding slightly. A remark from Chase implies that his father regularly beats him. Chase later quotes his parents often argue. On the night of the Rite of Thunder, Victor tells Geoffrey that he really loves his son, and Janet later admits she doesn't know how her soul is, because of the murders.\n\nWhen Chase receives an opportunity to bring Gert back to life, he immediately agrees to take it: sacrifice an innocent life and Gert would return alive. Chase agrees to the deal and wishes to sacrifice himself, because he had realized he was innocent; Victor would often abuse Chase when he was young, hitting him with a Burbank phone book, which Chase quotes as \"strong enough to hurt but not leave any marks\". Janet would then put on the radio, so she wouldn't hear her son crying downstairs. Victor would hurt him for getting a D in Algebra, a parking ticket, or even if he was just having a bad day. Chase had never thought of them as good excuses, so he had begun to make up his own, and even believe them, until he realized that he was entirely innocent.\n\nGene and Alice Hayes (\"the Outcasts\") are Molly Hayes' parents. The two are telepathic mutants who posed as doctors. Gene first appears as a very awkward man, unwilling to talk about his daughter's puberty. Alice is described a strong and caring mother, but still able to offer up her own daughter as a ransom to capture the five other runaways. When the Gibborim had called the Hayes for the first meeting, Gene and Alice had been getting harassed by the neighbours, who had thrown rocks at them for being mutants. Just before a furious Gene was about to protect a whimpering Alice, the two had been called forth by the Gibborim. This led to the Hayeses' strong hatred towards humans, a reason they were willing to conspire with the Deans to kill the human members of the Pride and ensure the six tickets in paradise for themselves, Molly, and the three Deans. It was revealed early on that the Hayes had no idea Molly was a mutant herself, Molly having tested negative for the mutant gene, but when Molly's supposed puberty was actually her mutant genes kicking in, the Hayes were shocked. The two are telepaths, capable of memory removal and sedation, but this has been reversed on at least one occasion—when they had wiped Cloak's memory of ever encountering the Runaways, Cloak and Dagger traveled back to New York, where after receiving a blow to the head, Cloak remembered.\n\nMolly had difficulty in believing her parents were villains for two main reasons: because of her age, and her strong empowering belief her parents were actually innocent people. After Molly had escaped a villain named \"the Provost\", Molly rescued several other runaway children who had thought their parents villains and offered them a place on the team. When they rejected and said they would go to their families, Molly later had a dream of her parents, reminding her they would still be going to Disneyland, and Molly admitting to her dream-mother that her whole experience as a runaway was a horrible nightmare. The dream-Alice comforts Molly by telling her it was nothing but a dream, and not to worry, because she's home.\n\nEmma Frost later mentions that she knew the Hayeses; The Hellfire Club had originally reached out for them, but the Hayeses refused. Frost tells Cyclops that the Hayeses were monsters and suggested that Molly was probably better off without them. Later, Molly and her chaperone Wolverine are captured by a super-villain seeking revenge against the Hayeses for stopping his bid for Pride territory and brutally massacring his men and sadistically torturing him seven years previously. He happily confronts Molly with the reality of her parents' evil and sadism, telling her that her parents allegedly killed many people, including children, often for no reason and took pleasure in torturing them. He plans on exacting his revenge by killing Molly, though Wolverine manages to defeat him. Afterward, Wolverine comforts her, stating that her parents must have truly loved her despite being super-villains, though Molly accepts that they were \"bad people\" and realizes that she will never see her parents in the same light as before.\n\nWhen Molly is sent to stay with her grandmother after the team disbands, she learns that this grandmother was her direct maternal grandmother, who had taken in Molly's father when he ran away, and carried out various genetic research to give Molly's parents their powers, accounting for how Molly's parents could share the same mutant power. Molly's grandmother eventually reveals her true agenda to try and genetically recreate Molly's dead parents, but Molly rejects this idea, choosing instead to return to the Runaways as the team come back together.\n\nRobert and Tina Minoru (\"the Magicians\") are Nico Minoru's parents. The two are dark wizards who posed as an average, church-going, middle-class couple. The two are the least-liked by the Pride; in a holograph, it's revealed the Steins and Yorkes consider them unstable because they're magicians; the Deans and Hayes hate them because they're humans; Geoffrey Wilder also criticizes Robert on one occasion. When the Gibborim had first abducted the Pride for the first meeting, the Minorus were on their wedding day. Arriving in the Gibborim's chamber with the rest of the Pride, the two quickly unleashed a black hole of bats at the Pride. In their first appearance, the two appear as an average couple, where Robert is unwilling to be late, and Tina is an \"Oprah\" fan. When the Runaways witness the Rite of Blood, they see that Robert conducts the enchanted spell of sacrifice. The Runaways see the Minorus in action when they get ambushed at the Steins' laboratory; Tina conducts her powers using a mystical Staff known as the \"Staff of One\", and Robert conducts his powers through a spellbook. Tina attempted to stab Nico with the Staff, but, due to Nico's own innate magic and hereditary link with Tina, the Staff was absorbed by Nico, who kept it. It is later hinted that there is more than one Staff of One, as shown when Bo, the first lady to a drug dealer in New York, knew of Nico's incantation and Chase commented that Nico had \"a Staff of One.\" The Minorus, though having mentioned that they only \"dabbled\" in the dark arts the first time the Pride was gathered, were given enough mystical power by the Gibborim to rule Los Angeles and even beyond. In the final battle with the Pride at the Marine Vivarium, Nico ignored the Wilders' and her parents' wishes to rule in the new world. Regardless, Tina screamed at Nico to run while she and Robert held back the Gibborim, a reason the Runaways were able to flee to safety.\n\nThe Minorus are considered highly proficient spellcasters of the dark arts, able to evoke spells of various effects with spoken incantations and without, capable of conjuring bats from nowhere, conducting the Rite of Blood, garbing themselves and others in their costumes, summoning the Staff of One and an enchanted tome (the Abstract), summoning waterspouts, killing a genetically engineered prehistoric creature, teleporting a Majesdanian alien back to his home planetoid in another galaxy, freezing another, even a holder of the Staff of One in time, and project energy blasts of sufficient strength to hold off Elder Gods (if but for moments). The Minorus are involved with various other mystical matters such as Dormammu and Agamotto. Nevertheless, for whatever reason (presumably due to the lack of the Staff of One because Nico stole it), the Minorus appeared incapable, despite their immense power and experience in dark magic, of locating the Runaways, though they were but at most several miles from the Pride.\n\nWhen the Minorus combine their strength, without the usage of magical artifacts, they are capable of sending Frank Dean back to the planet he came from, while the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, with access to all his own magical items at the Sanctum Sanctorum, claims he cannot bring the New Avengers to Japan through \"any\" magical means.\n\nRobert and Tina later appear in a dream that Nico has, where the two criticize Nico and call her a slut for kissing Alex, Chase, Topher, and Victor. Nico then overcomes her previous insecurities by quickly killing her parents in her dream by screaming a spell, \"and I liked you better dead!\"\n\nThe Minorus are mentioned to Nico by Marie LaVeau, who reveals that they were acquaintances of hers, and that they were never fully committed to the Dark Path, only to the Pride, unlike Marie. Marie claims to Nico that the Minorus used her, gained her trust, and betrayed her, taking the valuable and extraordinarily powerful \"Black Mirror\" from her. The Mirror possessed the ability to gaze into other dimensions, and even the power to travel through time, \"if used correctly.\" Maries scathingly adds certain members of the Pride, such as the Yorkes, had access to the secrets of time traveling, which were shared not with the Minoru clan. The Minorus were so determined to learn about their own past and family secrets they used the Mirror to do so. Yet whatever vision they saw, it was so terrifying even they were unnerved and magically sealed the Mirror so none could ever use it again, instead causing a mere reflection to stare back at the beholder. Nico is told Marie requires her blood to unlock the Mirror's locking spell, and Nico herself does so, though also, as she intended, releases the Staff of One. Nico engages Marie in direct magical combat, and triumphs. However, after Nico unsuccessfully tries to utilize the power of the Mirror to revive Alex Wilder, Marie finds the last page of the Darkhold, and promises Nico that they will encounter each other again, leaving the teenage witch to stare at the shattered remains of the Black Mirror, indeed a mirror of her own life at the time.\n\nAfter their death, their influence still lives on—the \"New Pride\" found their magical runestone as part of the ritual to summon Geoffrey Wilder to their present time, and uses more of their magical artifacts to their benefit, such as the Eye-Spy Cauldron to spy upon the Runaways and the chameleon glamour charm Wilder utilized to conceal his true identity by magically giving himself the voice and physical appearance of Chamber and Alex Wilder. The Minorus have also curiously made mention to the Spine of Agamotto, a benevolent powerful magical being who is the main patron of the Sorcerer Supreme and creator of the Eye of Agamotto to install a \"lummox\" as Los Angeles's governor. Nico also assumed the security daemons in their hostel were among the old defense spells of the Minorus, and according to her, the Silver Bullet Gang (a gang of werewolves) were actually driven out from Los Angeles by her parents.\n\nMonk Theppie, an ally of Val Rhymin mentions Robert Minoru, his (presumed late) friend, once said that all things are possible, and says he misses the Minorus, appearing near tears when he thinks of them, and saying that the L.A. magic scene hasn’t been the same without them: \"\"Good times.\"\" This past relationship to the Minorus is also revealed to Nico when the two confront.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pride is mentioned as ruling Southern California in the \"House of M\" reality. Unlike the mainstream reality, their children stay with their parents.\n\n\n\nThe Pride appears in \"Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2\". They appear in the \"Runaways\" DLC.\n\n"}

He is best known as the youngest member of the late '80s pop group, New Kids on the Block. He has sold over one million records worldwide as a solo artist.\n\nMcIntyre was born in Needham, Massachusetts and raised in Jamaica Plain, United States. His parents were Thomas McIntyre, a union official, and his wife Katherine (née Bowen) a community theater actress. His mother died on November 30, 2014, after a long battle with Alzheimer's. His father died on November 12, 2018. He is the youngest of nine children with older siblings, Judy, Alice, Susan, Tricia, Carol, Jean, Kate, and Thomas Jr. in an Irish-American Catholic family. McIntyre graduated from Catholic Memorial School in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, an all-male Catholic private school. He shares the same birth date as his sister, Carol. Another sister, Judy, is an actress.\n\nIn 1985, just before his 13th birthday, he joined New Kids on the Block, replacing [Jamie Kelly]. Since the other four members of the band were already long-time school friends, he initially found it difficult to mesh with them. They eventually became one of the most successful boy bands of the late 20th century, producing two number one albums on the US Billboard charts. In 1991, \"Forbes\" listed the band as the highest-earning entertainers, beating Madonna and Michael Jackson. They split in 1994, but they reunited in 2008 and have remained active since.\n\nFollowing their split, McIntyre busied himself with songwriting and sought a solo recording contract. He made his acting debut in the film \"The Fantasticks\", which was based on the long-running off-Broadway musical. This 1995 film, starring Joel Grey and Jean Louisa Kelly, was released in theatres five years later.\n\nDisenchanted by his inability to find a recording contract, McIntyre used his own money to record his first solo album \"Stay the Same\" and sold it on his website. He then chose the album's title track as a single and took it to local Boston DJs, which eventually garnered the song national airplay. The combination of airplay and website sales for the single led to him signing a recording contract in 1999 with Sony Music USA, under the C2 label, a subsidiary of Columbia Records, which had previously been home to New Kids on the Block. The album was re-released on Sony's Work Records and sold more than a million copies around the world and the single \"Stay The Same\" peaked at #10 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 . The second single from the album was \"I Love You Came Too Late\".\n\nAlso in 1999, McIntyre recorded the song \"Remember Me\" for the film \"Southie\", which starred former bandmate Donnie Wahlberg. In 2001, McIntyre released his second solo album, \"Meet Joe Mac\", but it did not chart. \"Rain\" was the only single released from this album.\n\nIn 2004, McIntyre released his fourth solo album, \"8:09\", followed by \"Talk To Me\", an album of cover versions, in December 2006.\n\nIn April 2008, the New Kids on the Block reunited. The single \"Summertime\" was released in May 2008. Their first full-length album in fourteen years was released on September 2, 2008, titled \"The Block\". On September 18, 2008, they kicked off their reunion tour. In 2009, they began a 'Full Service' summer tour. They toured with Backstreet Boys in 2011.\n\nOn November 17, 2009, McIntyre released the single and video \"Here We Go Again\" from his upcoming EP of the same name. It was produced by Brent Paschke, Gabe Lopez, and Drew Ryan Scott. Paschke, Lopez and Scott also share cowriting with McIntyre on the project. The EP was released on iTunes in December 2009.\n\nIn November 2011, McIntyre released a Christmas album titled \"Come Home for Christmas\". The album features a collaboration with fellow New Kid Jordan Knight on \"Peace on Earth\" and includes holiday classics such as \"Winter Wonderland\", \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" and \"The Christmas Song\".\n\nMcIntyre played Jon in Jonathan Larson's \"Tick, Tick... BOOM!\" for both the off-Broadway (Fall 2001) and national tour (2003) versions of the play. In 2002, he appeared for a season on the television program \"Boston Public\". The following year, he released the live acoustic album \"One Too Many\" with Emanuel Kiriakou.\n\nIn 2004, he starred in the film \"Tony n' Tina's Wedding\" alongside Mila Kunis and also played Fiyero, the leading male role in the Broadway musical \"Wicked\" for which he received rave reviews. He replaced Norbert Leo Butz on July 20, 2004 and remained with the show until January 9, 2005 where he was later replaced by David Ayers. He also competed on the first season of the reality television show \"Dancing with the Stars\", winning third place with dance professional partner Ashly DelGrosso.\n\nMcIntyre appeared as Fonzie in \"Happy Days\", a musical based on the hit TV show at the Falcon Theater in Los Angeles from February 15 to March 12, 2006 and a second run from June 23 to August 13, 2006. McIntyre appeared in the film \"On Broadway\", which was filmed in his hometown of Boston.\n\nIn 2007, McIntyre appeared as Gary in \"Christmas At Cadillac Jacks\". It played around Christmas of that year on The Hallmark Channel and other various Christian channels and recently became available on DVD.\n\nOn November 2, 2011, McIntyre guest starred on an episode of the detective comedy \"Psych\". The title of the episode is \"The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2\" - season 6, episode 4.\n\nIn 2013, McIntyre appeared in the American buddy cop comedy \"The Heat \", as Peter Mullins, brother of Detective Shannon Mullins, played by Melissa McCarthy.

In 1764 he was made abbot \"in commendam\" of the rich abbey of Molesme. The support of his uncle, physician in ordinary to the duchess of Orléans, mother of the Regent, eventually rendered him rich, enabling him to set aside his former circumspect style of life and openly seat his mistresses at his table. His genuine capacity attracted the attention of Louis XV's chancellor, René Nicolas de Maupeou, who made him controller general in December 1769. His first big venture was helping Mme du Barry's partisans to bring down the minister of foreign affairs, Étienne François, duc de Choiseul the very next year by demonstrating that the government could not afford to go to war with Great Britain. \"Intelligent, plain-speaking, hard-working and rich\", Terray spent the next few years stabilizing the finances of the country by repudiating part of the national debt, suspending payments on the interest on government bonds, and levying forced loans. These reforms aroused mass protest among nobles and commoners alike, which forced Maupeou to strip the Parlements of their political power in 1771, so that further reforms could be enacted.\n\nTerray continued his overhaul of the financial system by reforming the collection of both the \"vingtième\" (a five percent tax on income) and the \"capitation\" (head tax) of Paris and renegotiating more advantageous agreements with the farmers general, the financiers who held the right to collect indirect taxes. These measures were responsible for a large increase in government revenue; however, he continued to face opposition, particularly over his restriction of free trade of grain, which opponents charged was part of a \"Pact of Famine\" with Louis XV designed to allow the king to profit from artificially high grain prices. When Louis XV died in May 1774, his successor Louis XVI bowed to pressure and dismissed both Terray and Maupeou.\n\nTerray's position enabled him to become a lavish patron of the arts. His rebuilding of his \"hôtel\" in rue Nôtre-Dame-des-Champs, c. 1769–74, was the last commission of Antoine-Mathieu Le Carpentier (1709–1773), who did not live to see its completion. The Hôtel Terray, \"notable for the good arrangement of its rooms\", later housed the Collège Stanislas and was demolished in 1849, when the rue Stanislas was extended through its garden, leaving an isolated pavilion. Pairs of paintings he commissioned from Nicolas Bernard Lépicié in 1775 (an \"Interior of a Customs-house\" and an \"Interior of a Market\") and from Claude-Joseph Vernet in 1779, displayed a strong didactic bias reflecting Terray's concerns with the economics of commerce, rather than a choice by the artists From the history painter Nicolas-Guy Brenet he commissioned two subjects, equally referent to his official position; one, \"Cincinnatus Made Dictator\" was a clear reference to the enlightened despotism under which he operated; the other made a less open reference to his reputation as a speculator in grain: \"The Roman Farmer\", in which Caius Furius Cressinus was wrongly accused of sorcery on account of the abundance of his crops: it had been exhibited at the Salon of 1775. Not all subjects of his commissions were so severe: from Jean-Jacques Caffiéri he commissioned a pair of table bronzes in 1777, on \"galante\" subjects: \"Cupid Vanquishing Pan\" (Wallace Collection, London) and \"Friendship Surprised by Love\" (Toledo Museum of Art). A small marble \"Bartholomew\" by Pierre Le Gros the Younger was purchased from the estate of the painter Jean-François de Troy, the head of the French Academy in Rome. Among the rich furnishings of the Hôtel Terray was a secretary desk by Bernard II van Risamburgh. His funeral monument was sculpted by Clodion.\nAfter his death, the collection was dispersed by his nephew at auction in 1779.\n"}

{"id": "2048531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048531", "title": "St. Louis Arsenal", "text": "St. Louis Arsenal\n\nThe St. Louis Arsenal is a large complex of federal military weapons and ammunition storage buildings operated by the United States Air Force in St. Louis, Missouri. During the American Civil War, the St. Louis arsenal's contents were transferred to Illinois by Union Captain Nathaniel Lyon, an act that helped fuel tension between secessionists and those citizens loyal to the Federal government.\n\nIn 1827, the United States War Department decided to replace a 22-year-old arsenal, Fort Belle Fontaine (located north of St. Louis on the bluffs above the Missouri River) with a larger facility to meet the needs of the rapidly growing military forces in the West. Lt. Martin Thomas selected a tract of land on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River and procured the land for the new arsenal. It was close to the main military base, Jefferson Barracks, and had easy access to the city and the river. By 1840, 22 separate buildings had been erected, and a garrison of 30 ordnance soldiers manned the site, along with 30 civilian employees, who assembled finished weapons and artillery from parts supplied by private contractors and armories. In its original configuration it included Arsenal Island in the Mississippi River. The island has since disappeared.\n\nWhen the Mexican–American War erupted, the demand for small arms, ammunition, and artillery substantially increased. At its peak during the war years, the St. Louis Arsenal employed over 500 civilian workers. During the two years of war, the arsenal produced 19,500 artillery rounds, 8.4 million small arms cartridges, 13.7 million musket balls, 4.7 million rifle balls, 17 field cannon with full attachments, 15,700 stand of small arms, 4,600 edged weapons, and much more. Production was curtailed following the cessation of the war, although the arsenal workers (back to their normal complement of 30) did spend considerable time refurbishing and reconditioning surplus arms returned from the war.\n\nAnother flurry of activity accompanied the Utah War in 1857–58, when President James Buchanan ordered an expedition of Federal troops to suppress the Mormons. Employment exceeded 100 workers, and the arsenal provided much of the weaponry for William S. Harney's forces.\n\nAnticipating secession, a number of Southern states asked for their quota of arms and ammunitions to be shipped from the St. Louis Arsenal to state armories and arsenals. Buchanan's Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, a Virginian, was accused of aiding in this transfer of arms and resigned his post in December 1860 to return to Virginia. An investigation cleared him, but many suspected that his involvement had helped arm the Confederate States of America and prepare it for war in advance of actual ordinances of secession from the individual states.\n\nThe armory, which was used for assembling weapons rather than manufacturing them, had the biggest collection of rifles and muskets of any of the slave states and was fourth after Massachusetts, District of Columbia, New York and California in total number of muskets and rifles (38,141). It also had the third largest arms and munitions manufactury in the Federal system (behind Springfield, MA and Harper's Ferry, VA).\n\nDespite its enormous strategic importance, it had traditionally been lightly guarded, with a staff of forty military and civilian personnel.\n\nIn March 1861 the Missouri Constitutional Convention of 1861 voted 98 to 1 to stay in the Union but not supply weapons or men to either side if war broke out. The security of such a large munitions depot became an immediate flash point.\n\nOn April 20, 1861 a pro-Confederate mob at Liberty, Missouri seized the only other arsenal in the state—the Liberty Arsenal and made off with about 1,000 rifles and muskets.\n\nOn April 23, Brigadier General Harney departed for Washington, leaving Captain Lyon in temporary command of the Western Department an the Arsenal. Lyon immediately began enlisting Missouri Unionist Volunteers into Federal service. This action had been ordered over a week before by Secretary of War Simon Cameron, but blocked by General Harney's refusal to execute his orders.\n\nCameron, General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, and midwestern Unionists continued to be concerned for the safety of the over 30,000 weapons at the Arsenal. During the evening of April 29, on orders from Secretary Cameron, Captain Nathaniel Lyon transported 21,000 rifles and muskets to Alton, Illinois via steamer.\n\nAround May 1 Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson who had favored the South but had publicly pledged to uphold Missouri neutrality (at least until open hostilities between the Federal Government and the CSA) called out the Missouri Volunteer Militia for \"maneuvers\" about northwest of the arsenal at Lindell's Grove (now the campus of St. Louis University) then outside the city of St. Louis in what has been called \"Camp Jackson.\"\n\nLyon suspected the maneuvers were a thinly veiled attempt to seize the arsenal (suspicions furthered by the discovery that Jefferson Davis had sent artillery to the maneuvers).\n\nOn May 10, Lyon surrounded the militia, which surrendered. While marching the Militiamen through the streets of St. Louis back to the arsenal, a riot erupted. The troops opened fire on the crowd killing 28 and wounding 90 civilians outright and then killing another seven as the night progressed in what is called the Camp Jackson Affair.\n\nOn May 11, the Missouri General Assembly approved a measure to create the Missouri State Guard to \"resist invasion\" (by federal forces) and \"suppress rebellion\" (by Missouri Unionists enrolled in Federal service) with Sterling Price as its major general. \n\nOn May 12, Price and William S. Harney signed the Price-Harney Truce which pledged that the state and federal forces would: maintain order in the parts of the state they controlled; protect the rights of all persons in their zones of control; and avoid any provocative acts. Price promised Harney that he would hold the state of the Union and if Confederate forces entered, he would fight them.\n\nWhile MG Price's statement was probably simply a deception to buy time, it caused consternation in the Confederate capitol at Richmond. At that moment, envoys secretly dispatched by Governor Jackson, with Price's knowledge, were asking Confederate President Jefferson Davis to order an invasion to \"liberate\" Missouri. They had informed Davis that the Missouri State Guard would fight alongside the Confederate troops and drive the Federal forces from the state.\n\nOn May 30, Harney was relieved of command by Abraham Lincoln after demands by Missouri Unionists who felt he was allowing Governor Jackson and General Price to build a secessionist army which would eventually march on, and capture, St. Louis, the main Unionist stronghold in the state.\n\nOn June 11, Lyon and Jackson met one last time, at the Planter's House hotel in St. Louis, to discuss the right of access to the interior of the state for Federal troops. Jackson demanded that Federal forces be limited to metropolitan St. Louis, and that pro-Unionist \"Home Guard\" companies in St Louis and elsewhere in the state be disbanded. Lyon responded that such a limitation on Federal authority \"means war\", and the meeting broke up. Jackson and General Price, who were in St. Louis on a safe conduct, immediately returned to Jefferson City, ordered the railroad bridges burned, and prepared for war. Lyon followed several days later, moving troops and artillery up the Missouri river by steamboat. He captured the state capitol without resistance, and routed the Missouri State Guard at the Battle of Boonville on June 17, 1861. This action secured most of the key strategic parts of the state for the Federal Government, which would control those areas for the rest of the war.\n\nLyon pursued Governor Jackson and the State Guard down towards the Arkansas border. In August, with the enlistments of his Three Month regiments expiring and facing a combined force of 12,000 Missouri State Guard, Confederates and Arkansas State Troops, Lyon was forced to commit his 5,000 troops to a preemptive attack south of Springfield. The Battle of Wilson's Creek, often called the \"Bull Run of the West\" was a confused and bloody one. With a few exceptions, the troops on both sides fought hard and well, and in the end number told. General Lyon was killed leading a charge late in the day, and his successor, Major Schofield, concerned about low ammunition stocks withdrew towards Springfield. The exhausted southern army did not pursue.\n\nA significant tactical victory for the Confederates, in the end Wilson's Creek was strategically barren. The Arkansas and Confederate troops withdrew across the border, leaving Sterling Price to \"liberate\" Missouri on his own. While Price went on to win several subsequent engagements, in the end he too had to withdraw, due to a lack of supplies.\n\nThe St. Louis Arsenal remained in Federal hands throughout the Civil War, and, with St. Louis firmly in Union control, provided substantial quantities of war materiel to the armies in the Western Theater.\n\nIn March 1869, of the old arsenal grounds were given to the City of St. Louis for the creation of Lyon Park, named for Lyon.\n\nIn 1871 the arsenal was transferred to the better secured Jefferson Barracks. That complex was retained by the U.S. Army, with substantial peaks in weaponry and ammunitions storage and dispensing during World Wars I and II. In 1956, it was transferred to the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe arsenal complex remains an active part of the military today, with much of it off limits to tourists and visitors. The Arsenal is maintained by the USAF and the Department of Defense, housing a major branch of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. \n\n"}

He played college baseball at Alabama for coach Jim Wells from 1996 to 1999 and played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Cincinnati Reds. Phillips was raised in Demopolis, Alabama, where he played baseball for the Demopolis Academy Generals. Phillips was an All-American for the Tide.\n\nPhillips was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers as a shortstop in the 41st round of the draft as a high school senior and again by the New York Yankees in the 7th round of the 1999 draft as a college graduate of the University of Alabama. He signed with the Yankees, but did not reach the Major Leagues until a call-up session towards the end of the 2004 season; he made his Major League debut on September 14, 2004. In his first Major League AB, he hit a home run over the Green Monster in Fenway Park off Terry Adams of the Boston Red Sox. Phillips is one of ten players to homer in his first at bat as a Yankee, along with Marcus Thames, Bubba Crosby, Todd Zeile, Wilson Betemit, Cody Ransom, Mark Reynolds, Curtis Granderson, Tyler Austin, and Aaron Judge. He became the 21st player in Major League history to hit a home run on the first pitch of his Major League career.\n\nAlso, in 2004, Phillips received the Yankees' Kevin Long \"Minor-League Player of the Year\" Award in a season where he led all Yankees minor leaguers in batting average (.321) and RBI (101), ranked second in home runs (30), and was voted the Most Valuable Player of the International League All Star Game after hitting a 10th inning walk-off home run. In , Phillips earned the James P. Dawson Award as the Yankees' most outstanding rookie during spring training.\n\nPhillips's time previous to at the Major League level had been limited to defensive replacement and late season call-up. In 2006, Phillips started the year as the primary backup at first base, behind Jason Giambi. This changed, however, when Gary Sheffield went on the disabled list. Primary designated hitter Bernie Williams took over the starting right field job, leaving the DH spot open. With Giambi's bad knees and his sub-par defense in the field, he became the primary DH. Phillips took over at first base and played well. This proved manager Joe Torre correct when he said all that Phillips needed was more at bats. He led the team with a .333 batting average in June and continued with his .333 average for the first 22 games of July. His average on July 26 was .300, with 30 hits in 100 at bats. Earlier, his light hitting triggered GM Brian Cashman to go out and trade for Craig Wilson of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Phillips was kept on the roster mostly because of his versatility to play second base or third base. Also, he could play first if Wilson was forced to play the outfield or catch.\n\nA family emergency (his mother Linda was hurt in a car crash) caused Phillips to miss much of his 2007 spring training with the Yankees. In the end, he only played in 15 games, saw 26 at bats, and had a .192 average. Due to his inability to make up for lost time and Josh Phelps's (Phillips opponent for a roster spot on the Yankees) outstanding performance (spring training stats include 3 home runs, 14 hits, a .667 slugging percentage, and .389 batting average), Phillips was passed over for a roster spot on the 2007 team. When informed of manager Joe Torre's decision to go with Phelps over Phillips, Phillips reportedly thanked Torre for the opportunity and asked if Phelps had been informed of the decision yet so he could congratulate him.\n\nPhillips was called up to the Yankees on June 19, 2007, after Phelps was designated for assignment. Throughout the 2007 season, Phillips became an important part of the team as a result of injuries to first baseman Jason Giambi and Doug Mientkiewicz. Due to these injuries, Phillips found himself used in the role of primary first baseman for the Yankees. He enjoyed great success through the months of July (hitting .320 with 16 RBI) and August (hitting .273 with 7 RBI). On September 2, while batting in the 5th inning against Devil Rays starter Jason Hammel, Phillips was hit on the wrist by a pitch. He would later leave the game and get an MRI and an X-Ray taken. It was announced on September 3 that Phillips had a fractured wrist and surgery would be required, needing 4–6 weeks, ending his season. Phillips was designated for assignment on December 3, 2007, to make room for Jose Molina. He cleared waivers on December 7, was offered an outright assignment to Triple-A Scranton, but declined the assignment and opted to become a free agent. In 2013, Andy appeared in the Old Timers Day game at Yankee Stadium.\n\nOn January 4, 2008, Phillips signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. On March 28, after hitting .277 in 2008 spring training, he was reassigned to minor-league camp, and he began the season with the Reds' Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville Bats. On May 28, the Reds purchased his contract, and he was added to the active roster. On June 22, 2008, Phillips was designated for assignment to make room for Jeff Keppinger, who was coming off of the disabled list. Three days later, Phillips was claimed by the New York Mets and added to their 25-man roster. He was then designated for assignment by the Mets on July 1, 2008. He was reclaimed by the Cincinnati Reds off waivers on July 3.\n\nOn December 22, 2008, he signed to a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, and was invited to Spring Training as a \"non-roster invitee\", the same status in which he was invited to Spring Training with the Reds in 2008. He played so well early in spring training that he was considered a lock to make the opening day roster, but a back injury sidelined him for three weeks, and he ended up assigned to Indianapolis instead.\n\nOn April 17, 2009, Phillips was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for pitcher Michael Dubee, and assigned to the Charlotte Knights of the International League. He filed for free agency on June 15, 2009.\n\nOn June 23, 2009 Phillips signed with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball. Following the 2009 season, the Carp did not pick up Phillips' option for the 2010 season and he signed with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in January 2010.\n\nOn December 22, 2010 Phillips was introduced as the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team's hitting coach beginning in 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "2048555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048555", "title": "Bran Mak Morn", "text": "Bran Mak Morn\n\nBran Mak Morn is a hero of five pulp fiction short stories by Robert E. Howard. In the stories, most of which were first published in \"Weird Tales\", Bran is the last king of Howard's romanticized version of the tribal race of Picts.\n\nAt the age of 13, Howard, being of Scottish-Irish descent, began his studies of Scottish history and became fascinated with what he calls \"the small dark Mediterranean aborigines of Britain\". This \"Mediterranean aborigines\" reference described Howard's readings on the now-discredited Turanid race theory of the 1800s and early 1900s proposing a common Mediterranean origin for varied European peoples of the Neolithic era. As these Picts were portrayed as inferior to later tribes, Howard imagined them as a link between modern and ancient times.\n\nHis Picts originated on a group of islands in the Western Ocean at the time Valusia, the kingdom of the Atlantean Kull, existed. The Picts and the barbaric Atlanteans had some kind of ancient blood feud. King Kull, however, formed a strong political link between the Pictish Isles and his kingdom of Valusia. When Atlantis, Lemuria, and Valusia sank into the sea thousands of years after Kull's time, the Picts survived and were flung into a period of cultural decline. They forgot the art of metalworking and returned to their technique of flintknapping.\n\nHoward marks Bran as the \"chief of the Cruithni Picts\" suggesting that he followed the belief that the Picts once colonized Northern Ireland as well as Scotland (cf Cruthin).\n\nThey migrated north until they reached Caledon, the northern lands of the later British Isles. They drove the extant tribes northward until the Aryans, Celts, and Germans invaded.\n\nThe Picts were pushed to the North, where they mingled with the tribes they had defeated earlier. Forgetting most of their technological skills, they became brutish and skilled in warcraft.\n\nAlthough Bran Mak Morn has dark eyes, he doesn't resemble the Caledonian Picts as Howard depicts them. He refers to himself as a Mediterranean, possibly meaning that he associates himself with the more ancient Picts.\n\nFollowing Bran Mak Morn's death, he is deified and worshipped as the \"Dark Man\" or \"Dark One\" by the Caledonians of Pictish descent. There seems to be a cult centred around him on \"the Isle of Altar, near the Scottish mainland\". There is a legend, similar to the idea that Bran The Blessed's severed head guards Britain from invasion, about Bran: \"...mayhap we shall come to you again in your need, as Bran Mak Morn, great king of Pictdom, shall come again to his people some day in the days to come.\"\n\nIn \"Tigers of the Sea\", taking place in the time of King Arthur, Picts are one of the groups active in the turbulent British Islands in the aftermath of the Fall of Rome. In one story, they kidnap a Briton girl and intend on sacrificing her to their deity. In another, they are oppressed by Norse invaders before planning a bloody and ruthless revenge. Cormac Mac Art, Howard's Irish Viking character, alternately fights them or makes temporary alliances with them, as circumstances dictate. None of the stories set in this period makes any mention of Bran Mak Morn.\n\nHoward's Picts still seems to be a mysterious, active fighting force during the Norwegian occupation of the Scottish islands as late as the 11th Century. They seem to be withdrawing from civilization at this time: \"When the Scot Kenneth McAlpine broke the Kingdom of Galloway, the last remnant of the Pictish empire faded like snow on the mountains. Like wolves, we live now among the scattered islands, among the crags of the highlands and the dim hills of Galloway. We are a fading people.\"\n\nIn the story \"The Children of the Night\" (1931) set in contemporary times, a character states that a \"Bran Cult\", involving the worship of Bran's statue in a secret cave, still exists among the modern descendants of the Picts.\n\nMany writers have been drawn to the idea of the Picts and created fictional stories or mythology about them in the absence of real knowledge. This romanticized view tends to portray them as occasionally noble savages, much as the view of Europeans on Native Americans in the 18th century. Howard is not among these romantics, representing his Picts as a tribe of primitive savages sinking into brutehood, with Bran alone avoiding this decay. In fact, Robert E. Howard's romanticism belongs more to view of the \"Celtic Twilight\" (see Celtic Revival) – showing the Picts suffering a \"Pictish Twilight\" at the hands of the Celts, Romans, and Scandinavians in the Bran Mak Morn story strand.\n\nThey are a special favorite race of Robert E. Howard and are mentioned frequently in his tales. The Picts have a continuity throughout Howard's fiction. In terms of internal chronology, the Picts first appear in the James Allison stories \"Marchers of Valhalla\" (c. 1932) and \"The Valley of the Worm\" (1934) where the Picts are a prehistoric tribe at the beginnings of human history. Later, the descendants of these Picts appear in the tales of King Kull of Atlantis, where they are Kull's allies (although culturally enemies of his people, the Atlanteans), and the Hyborian Age of Conan the Barbarian where they are the mortal enemies of the Cimmerians, who are actually descended from the old Atlanteans though they don't remember their ancestry or alliance. The Picts of the Hyborian Age are depicted as analogous to Native Americans. Howard also wrote tales about the last King of the Picts, Bran Mak Morn, set in real historical time and they figure commonly as enemies of Cormac Mac Art. These Picts are closer to the common image of cave men than to Native Americans. In fact, the character of Brule, the Spear Slayer, in the Kull stories, is a member of the Pre-Cataclysmic Age Picts. The world of Kull is destroyed by a Great Cataclysm, which drives its peoples northward and reduces them to \"brute hood\". Over a millennium, the humans rise again to a barbaric culture and start to spread out once more over the world.\n\nAccording to the long historical exposition which Howard attributes to a Pict wizard in \"Men of the Shadows\", the Picts have originated in the westernmost reaches of North America and gradually migrated eastwards until reaching the Mediterranean area. At one time, they spread to large areas of the world, but gradually vanished except for several splinter groups. Although some of these groups lived in remote jungles and southern continents, the most prominent body of Picts settled in the British isles, where they displaced a supposedly mongoloid race that had been the initial residents of the isles (though their origins were elsewhere).\n\nAn interesting point is that, in the Hyborian age, when they populate the western edge of Europe and share a border with Aquilonia, which tries to push them further west to colonize new provinces, the Picts show clear Native American influence, in their appearance, dress, armament, manner of conducting wars, and even in the regional names of the new Aquilonian provinces. It's hard to tell whether this is a case of inconsistency on the part of Howard, or a throwback to their earliest origins and savagery, as Hyborian Picts are definitely more primitive and savage than those Kull knew.\n\nEventually, as Howard describes in \"The Hyborian Age\", the Picts gain metal-working and armored cavalry, unite under a charismatic leader, conquer the Hyborian kingdoms, and destroy Aquilonia. However, they are not able to maintain the culture they conquered and are eventually engulfed in the cataclysm which ends the Hyborian Age - though some of them survive into later times.\n\nThis previous race sought refuge underground, and over long millennia they evolved into stunted and hideous creatures, who were the initial subjects of tales concerning elves and dwarves. The Picts were in turn displaced by the invading Celts. So, they fled northward and interbreeded with a tribe of \"red haired barbarians\", resulting in a genetic shift toward diminished height. Following subsequent Roman, Breton, and Saxon invasions, the Picts too sought refuge underground, just like the natives they had displaced before.\n\nHoward's descriptions of the later Picts portray them as very small in height, squat and muscular, adept at silent movement, and most of all brutish and uncivilized. They painted themselves with woad, much like the historical Picts, and lived in very large caverns, some natural and some artificially expanded. They had a custom of burning enemy prisoners alive, a ceremony usually presided over by their 'wizards' or priests, whom Howard portrayed as having a twisted philosophy and mindset produced by many years of hatred, in direct opposition to the Pictish warrior-king Bran Mak Morn, who attempted to restore the Picts to their honourable place in the world and drive out the Roman invaders.\n\nBran Mak Morn's mindset was very unusual for his time and location, because he favored an alliance between the \"native\" British populations, including the Picts, Bretons, and Celts, against the Romans, in a setting when each of these tribes fostered an intense hatred or mistrust for all the others. Robert E. Howard also mentions that some warriors among the Picts could assume the forms of wolves, in the manner of werewolves, on their own free will. These Picts were a \"race\" with whom Howard felt the most affinity, and for this reason they were one of his favorite subjects, despite being almost wholly fictitious and deviating from historical fact.\n\nThe exact time of Bran's life is unclear, but would seem to be the end of the 3rd Century of the Christian Era, while Rome was ruled by the co-emperors Diocletian and Maximian. He is mentioned as both a chief and king. Bran lead his Picts in attacks against Hadrian's Wall, and cause the later Roman Empire some trouble. He travels as far south as the city of Eboracum (York). He is said to have died in battle.\n\nThe name is derived from the name of Brennus, the Gaul who sacked Rome, and comes from a Britonnic word meaning \"raven\". One should also not overlook Bran the Blessed, the giant \"High King of the Isles of the Mighty\" in the Welsh Mabinogion. Howard says the Mak Morn was inspired by the Irish hero Goll mac Morna. He added a \"k\" to give the name a non-Gaelic appearance.\n\nThe Bran Mak Morn stories are connected to the Cthulhu Mythos and occur in the same fictional universe. Twice in \"Worms of the Earth\", mention is made of the black gods of R'lyeh, resting place of Cthulhu, from the works of H. P. Lovecraft, a friend and correspondent of Howard. In the earliest extant copy of \"Worms of the Earth\", mention of Cthulhu himself is made by name although this was later changed to \"Nameless Gods\" in the final edition. Also mentioned in the same story is Dagon, a water monster mentioned in some stories by Lovecraft and named after a real-world Philistine god. Lovecraft himself references Bran Mak Morn in his short story \"The Whisperer in Darkness\".\n\nBran Mac Mufin, a character in Dave Sim's comic book series \"Cerebus\", is an homage and parody of Bran Mak Morn. His name is a play on words, referring to the pastry bran muffin and the McDonald's breakfast sandwich the McMuffin.\n\nMost of Howard's Bran Mak Morn stories were first published in \"Weird Tales\". A few stories didn't appear in print until after Howard's death.\n\nNote: The order of publication doesn't correspond with the order in which the stories were written.\n\n\n\n\nHoward's stories, poems, and fragments featuring Bran Mak Morn have been published several times as a collection in book form. Not every publication has been a complete collection.\n\n\nOther writers have published novels featuring Howard's Bran Mak Morn.\n\n\nBran Mak Morn has appeared in several issues of Marvel Comics' \"Savage Sword of Conan\". In 1974 \"Men of Shadows\" was adapted by writer Roy Thomas and appeared in \"SSoC #102-104\", and \"106\".\n\nDark Horse Comics published \"Robert E. Howard's Savage Sword\" which features stories such as \"Worms of the Earth\" to \"Men of Shadows\" to \"Kings of the Night\". Some are brand new adaptations exclusive to the title, while others are reprints from previous publications.\n\nTwo band's have written songs about Bran Mak Morn:\n\n\nPeter Berg will direct the movie \"Bran Mak Morn\" for Universal Pictures. Chris Romano is writing the script. The movie was slated for 2012 release but till now no new information has been available about the film.\n\nThe name Bran Mak Morn and the names of Robert E. Howard's other principal characters are trademarked by Paradox Entertainment of Stockholm, Sweden, through its US subsidiary Paradox Entertainment Inc. Paradox also holds copyrights on the stories written by other authors under license from Robert E. Howard Properties Inc. Since Robert E.

Proctor Knott\n\nJames Proctor Knott (August 29, 1830 – June 18, 1911) was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky and served as the 29th Governor of Kentucky from 1883 to 1887. Born in Kentucky, he moved to Missouri in 1850 and began his political career there. He served as Missouri Attorney General from 1859 to 1861, when he resigned rather than swear an oath of allegiance to the federal government just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nKnott was disbarred and briefly imprisoned for his refusal to take the oath of allegiance. He returned to Kentucky in 1863 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.\n\nIn 1883, Knott left Congress and made a successful run for governor. He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and helped organized the college's law school in 1894. He served as dean of the law school until an illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died at his home in Lebanon, Kentucky on June 18, 1911.\n\nJ. Proctor Knott was born in Raywick, Marion County, Kentucky on August 29, 1830. He was the son of Joseph Percy and Maria Irvine (McElroy) Knott. He was tutored by his father from an early age, and later attended public school in Marion and Shelby counties. In 1846, he began to study law. In May 1850, he relocated to Memphis, Missouri, where he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in 1851. He also served in the offices of the circuit court and county clerks.\n\nKnott married Mary E. Forman on November 17, 1852. Forman died during the birth of the couple's first child in August 1853. On January 14, 1858, Knott married his cousin, Sarah R. McElroy.\n\nKnott's political career began in 1857 when he was elected to represent Scotland County in the Missouri House of Representatives. He served as chair of the judiciary committee and conducted the impeachment hearings against Judge Albert Jackson. Knott resigned his seat in the legislature in August 1858 to accept Governor Robert M. Stewart's appointment to fill the unexpired term of Missouri's attorney general, Ephraim B. Ewing. In 1860, he was elected to a full term as attorney general.\n\nIn January 1861, Missouri called a convention to determine whether it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union. Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.\n\nIn 1863, Knott returned to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in Lebanon. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1867. As a legislator, he opposed the Reconstruction agenda of the Radical Republicans and ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. He was re-elected to a second term, but did not stand for re-election in 1870.\n\nKnott's most notable action as a legislator occurred near the end of his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.\n\nKnott's speech, known as \"Duluth!\" or \"The Untold Delights of Duluth\", brought him national acclaim and copies of the speech were reprinted and sold. Residents of Duluth apparently were not offended by the speech, extending an offer for Knott to visit the city; Knott accepted the offer in 1891. In 1894, a city near Duluth was incorporated as \"Proctorknott\"; in 1904, it adopted its present name of Proctor, Minnesota.\n\nIn 1871, Knott made an unsuccessful bid to become governor of Kentucky, losing the Democratic nomination to Preston Leslie. He was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1875, serving four consecutive terms. He chaired the House Judiciary Committee for the first three of these terms. In 1876, he was named one of the managers of impeachment proceedings against ex-Secretary of War William W. Belknap.\n\nKnott was one of several candidates seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1883. Other prominent candidates included Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones, former Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner, Judge John S. Owsley, and Louisville mayor Charles Donald Jacob. Balloting began on May 16, 1883, with Jones as the leading vote-getter but unable to secure a majority. After four ballots, Jacob withdrew his name, and Knott moved into the lead. The following day, Owsley dropped out of the balloting, and Knott extended his lead. Though Buckner remained on the ballot, the race came down to Jones and Knott. Delegates from Owen County switched to Knott, and other counties soon followed suit. Jones withdrew, and Knott was nominated unanimously.\n\nIn the general election, Knott defeated Republican Thomas Z. Morrow by a margin of nearly 45,000 votes. During his term in office, he asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making equitable tax assessments. The legislature also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.\n\nKnott's most successful initiatives were in the area of education. Under his leadership, the state established a normal school for blacks in Frankfort and created a state teacher's organization. New legislation spelled out, often for the first time in the state's history, the duties and responsibilities of educators, administrators, and school boards.\n\nKnott's major shortcomings were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds that continued to rage in the state, including one that lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved the construction of the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of the groundwork for this project.\n\nFollowing his term as governor, Knott continued his legal practice in Frankfort. He declined two separate appointments offered to him by President Grover Cleveland. The first was to become Territorial Governor of Hawaii; the other was an appointment to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky's attorney general in 1887 and 1888, and in 1891, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.\n\nKnott became a professor of civics and economics at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1892. In 1894, Knott and Centre president William C. Young organized a law department at the college; Knott became the department's first dean. An illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died in Lebanon on June 18, 1911, and was buried at the Ryder Cemetery in Lebanon. Knott County, Kentucky was formed in 1884 and named in his honor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2048568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048568", "title": "Lake Vermilion", "text": "Lake Vermilion\n\nLake Vermilion is a freshwater lake in northeastern Minnesota, United States. The Ojibwe originally called the lake Nee-Man-Nee, which means “the evening sun tinting the water a reddish color”. French fur traders translated this to the Latin word \"Vermilion\", which is a red pigment. Lake Vermilion is located between the towns of Tower on the east and Cook on the west, in the heart of Minnesota's Arrowhead Region at Vermilion Iron Range. The area was mined from the late 19th century until the 1960s, and the Soudan Mine operated just south of the lake.\n\nThe lake contains black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, tullibee (cisco), walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch. Lake Vermilion is known for its walleye and muskie fishing. In the spring of 2005, Lake Vermilion was host to the annual Minnesota Governor’s Fishing Opener Weekend. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake's bluegill, cisco, crappie, northern pike, walleye, and white sucker due to mercury contamination. Many feel the increased population of muskies has had a detrimental effect on the walleye population, although some believe the walleye fishing when the walleye slot limit changed (18\" to 26\") and the bag limit was reduced (from 6 to 4) in recent years. However, as the population rebounded, a new special regulation for walleye came into effect in May 2017. The new regulation is a 20 to 26 inch protected slot limit, with one fish over 26 inches allowed in a four fish possession limit.\n\nThe lake attracts visitors from all parts of Minnesota and the midwestern United States, who lodge at the lake's numerous resorts and hotels. Tourists are drawn by Lake Vermilion's reputation as a fishing destination, as well as its setting in the northern Minnesota wilderness. The lake is near the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW).\n\nThe Minnesota DNR rates Lake Vermilion as the fifth largest lake by surface area within Minnesota borders. The surface area of Lake Vermilion is and has a maximum depth of . It is the southernmost section of the Canadian Shield, and contains over 365 islands.\n\nIn 2007, Governor Tim Pawlenty announced the state was negotiating the purchase from U.S. Steel of a large area of land on the southeastern shore of the lake for a proposed new Minnesota state park. The sale of the land at a cost of $18m was finalized in June 2010. Lake Vermilion State Park is being developed on the easterly southern shore of the lake, and is adjacent to and to the east of Soudan Underground Mine State Park.\n\nThe claim that \"in the 1940s, the National Geographic Society declared Lake Vermilion one of the top ten most scenic lakes in the United States\" has been rebutted by a representative of the National Geographic Society.\n\nOn May 13, 2014, it was announced that the 2015 Governor's Fisher Opener weekend would be held at Lake Vermilion again.\n\n"}
{"id": "2048575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048575", "title": "Legislative route (Minnesota)", "text": "Legislative route (Minnesota)\n\nIn the U.S. state of Minnesota, a legislative route is a highway number defined by the Minnesota State Legislature. The routes from 1 to 70 are constitutional routes, defined as part of the Babcock Amendment to the Minnesota State Constitution, passed November 2, 1920. All of them were listed in the constitution until a 1974 rewrite. Though they are now listed separately in §161.114 of the Minnesota Statutes, the definitions are legally considered to be part of the constitution, and cannot be altered or removed without an amendment. Legislative routes with numbers greater than 70 can be added or deleted by the legislature.\n\nUntil 1933 Constitutional Routes corresponded exactly to the number marked on the highways, but this is no longer necessarily the case. In fact, it is common for CR highways to be composed of several different trunk highways. When the U.S. Highway system was created in 1926, many of these roads were made up of one or more U.S. highways. Today, they now use a mix of Minnesota state highways, U.S. highways, and Interstate highways.\n\nConstitutional Route 1 is currently one of the most complex routes, composed of:\nHowever, the route can be considered to be superseded along almost its entire length by Interstate 35 (and I-35E) and Minnesota State Highway 61. By contrast, Constitutional Route 58 still has the same marked number and extent that it did in 1920.\n\nThere is some ambiguity in how literally the Minnesota Department of Transportation must interpret the constitutional routes. In some cases, the routes no longer directly serve communities for which they were once designated, but are routed along nearby highways instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n[See Note.]\n\n\nSubd. 232.*[[ (Minnesota)|Legislative Route 301.\n\nBeginning at a point on *[[ (Minnesota)|Legislative Route 3; thence extending in a general westerly direction to the main entrance of the Minnesota State Reformatory for Men.\n\nSubd. 233.\n\n[Repealed, 1Sp2003 c 22 s 3]\n\nSubd. 234.*[[ (Minnesota)|Legislative Route 303.\n\nDiscontinued and removed from T.H. system.

The studio also produced material for the Polish national television network, Telewizja Polska, as well as numerous promotional and commercial films for industry.

The official symbol of the IHS is the “Happy Human” supporting the world.\n\nIn June 1999, the Institute for Humanist Studies, Inc., was incorporated in the state of New York. With financial support from Larry Jones, the founding president of the Institute, the organization began its work as an educational non-profit institute, with the purpose of providing information to policy makers and others in order to advance humanism as a life philosophy. Much of this information was made available through its on line publication – Humanist Network News. In addition to information in the form of papers, etc., the Institute also offered distance-learning opportunities through its on line “Continuum of Humanist Education” curriculum. With time, these courses were made available without cost to those interested in them. Furthermore, through its registered lobbyist, the Institute sought to promote humanism within New York State Legislation. Intentionally avoiding a framework based on membership, the Institute understood itself as thereby being free to partner with other humanist organizations without competition for members. Based on this approach, the Institute became a founding member of the Secular Coalition for America. In addition to supporting these organizations through information, the Institute also provided grants averaging between $10,000-$20,000 to humanist organization in support of the policy efforts and programming. Those receiving grants include: Secular Student Alliance; International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organization (Belgium); Prometheus Society of Slovakia, Bratislava; and the International Humanist and Ethical Union (London).\n\nIn 2008, the Institute for Humanist Studies, Inc., began conversations with the American Humanist Association (AHA) with the purpose being a partnership with the AHA. In 2009, the conversations shifted to the possibility of the AHA taking over the operations of the Institute with the exception of its lobbying efforts. It was eventually decided in 2009 that the Institute should be reconstitute along the lines of a formal think tank, with another organization (The Humanist Institute) taking over its online classes. It was argued a formal think tank would be positioned to provide the humanist movement with information and other modes of assistance with the promotion of humanism in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nA meeting was held in Arizona in 2009 to map out the reconstituted Institute for Humanist Studies. Shortly after that meeting, a board of directors was constituted, and Anthony Pinn was asked to serve as Director of Research. The first Programming Director was Diane Griffin, who served in that capacity during the first nine months of the Institute. The vision statement for the new Institute was drafted and approved by the Board in November 2010. This document outlined the structure and purpose of the organization. \n\n\n"}

He has won major Australian national prizes for the short story, the novel, the essay, and for script writing. His work has been published in the United Kingdom, France and the United States and also translated into German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Serbian, and Swedish.\n\nMoorhouse is perhaps best known for winning the 2001 Miles Franklin Literary Award for his novel, \"Dark Palace\"; which together with \"Grand Days\" and \"Cold Light\", the \"Edith Trilogy\" is a fictional account of the League of Nations, which trace the strange, convoluted life of a young woman who enters the world of diplomacy in the 1920s through to her involvement in the newly formed International Atomic Energy Agency after World War II.\n\nFrank Thomas Moorhouse was born in Nowra, New South Wales, Australia, to a New Zealand born father of British ethnicity and a mother who was a third-generation Australian of British convict descent. His father was an inventor of agricultural machinery who, together with his wife, established a factory in Nowra to make machinery for the dairy industry.\n\nMoorhouse was a constant reader from an early age and decided to be a writer after reading \"Alice in Wonderland\" while bed-ridden for months from a serious accident when he was 12: \"After experiencing the magic of this book, I wanted to be the magician who made the magic.\"\n\nMoorhouse's infant and primary schooling was at Nowra Central and his secondary schooling at Wollongong Secondary Junior Technical (WSJT) High School to the Intermediate Certificate, and Nowra High School to Leaving Certificate. His military service includes army school cadets for two years at WSJT including signals specialist course and cadet officer course. He completed his compulsory national military service of three months basic training and three years part-time in the Reserve Army (infantry) in the University of Sydney Regiment and in the Riverina Regiment, Wagga Wagga (1957–1960). He studied units of undergraduate political science, Australian history, English and journalism – law, history and practice, at the University of Queensland as an external student while working as a cadet newspaper journalist in Sydney and as a journalist in Wagga Wagga, without completing a degree.\n\nAfter leaving school, Moorhouse began his career as a copy boy and then trained as a cadet journalist on the \"Daily Telegraph\" (1955–1957). He then worked as a reporter and editor on country newspapers during the years 1958–1962; the \"Wagga Wagga Advertiser\" as a reporter, the \"Riverina Express\" as reporter, and the \"Lockhart Review\" as editor. He returned to Sydney to become an administrator and tutor in media studies for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) and later became editor of the WEA magazine \"The Highway\" (1963–1965). He worked as a trade union organiser for the Australian Journalists' Association and as part-time editor of \"The Australian Worker\" newspaper of the AWU – a union representing shearers, drovers and other rural workers – the oldest trade union newspaper in Australia (1964). In 1966, he was briefly editor of the country newspaper \"The Boorowa News\".\n\nAt eighteen, he published his first short story, \"The Young Girl and the American Sailor\", in \"Southerly\" magazine and this was followed by publication of early stories in \"Meanjin\", \"Overland\", \"Quadrant\", \"Westerly\" and other Australian literary magazines.\n\nMoorhouse became a full-time fiction writer during the 1970s, also writing essays, short stories, journalism and film, radio and TV scripts. In his early career he developed a narrative structure which he has described as the 'discontinuous narrative'.\n\nMoorhouse has also written and lectured on the way communication and the control of communication has been developing and the relationship of creative professionals to the economy and to the political system. He has been active in the defence of freedom of expression and in analysis of the issues affecting it and in the 1970s was arrested and prosecuted on a couple of occasions while campaigning against censorship. He has been a chairman and a director and one of the founding group of the Australia Copyright Agency (CAL), which was set up by publishers and authors to coordinate the use of copyright and which now distributes millions of dollars annually to Australian writers. He has been a president of the Australian Society of Authors and member of the Australian Press Council. He was also an organiser for the Australian Journalists' Association.\n\nMoorhouse was appointed a member of the SYDNEY PEN eminent writers' panel in 2005.\n\nHe has participated in Australian and overseas conferences in arts, communication and related areas and has taught, been a guest lecturer and writer-in-residence at Australian and overseas universities.\n\nMoorhouse married his high school girlfriend Wendy Halloway in 1959, but they separated four years later, having no children. Since then he has led a sometimes turbulent bisexual life shaped by his own androgyny, some of which is chronicled in his book \"Martini: A Memoir\" (Random House 2005). Moorhouse currently lives alone in Potts Point, Sydney. Early in his career he committed himself to a philosophy of personal candour, stating that there was no question a person could ask of him to which he would not try to give an honest answer. In his public commentary he has questioned the notion of separation of public and private life and the concept of privacy.\n\nThroughout his life he has frequently gone alone on eight-day, map-and-compass, off-trail treks into wilderness areas. He is also a gourmand. He once said that he was a member of a think-tank called \"Wining and Dining\".\n\nDuring the researching and writing of his League of Nations novels – the 'Edith Trilogy' (1989–2011) – he lived in Geneva, various parts of France, Washington DC, Cambridge and Canberra.\n\nHis parents are dead and he has two older brothers, Owen and Arthur.\n\nIn 1985, Moorhouse was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to Australian literature; and in 2001 he received the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through writing. Moorhouse has been conferred with a Doctor of Letters \"honoris causa\" by Griffith University.\n\nMoorhouse's most significant literary award was the 2001 Miles Franklin Literary Award for his novel \"Dark Palace\", published in 2000.\n\n\"Forty-seventeen\" won \"The Age\" Book of the Year Award and the Australian Literature Society's Gold Medal in 1988. \"The writer in a time of terror\" appeared in \"Griffith Review\" and won the 2007 Alfred Deakin Prize for an Essay Advancing Public Debate in the Victorian Premier's Literary Award and the award for Social Equity Journalism in The Walkley Awards for Excellence in Journalism. In 1994, \"Grand Days\" won the Adelaide Festival National Prize for Fiction; in 1975 \"The Electrical Experience\" won the National Award for Fiction; and in 2012 \"Cold Light\" won the Queensland Literary Award for Fiction and made the short list for the 2012 Miles Franklin Literary Award.\n\n\"The Coca-Cola Kid\", a romantic comedy film based on Moorhouse's short stories in \"The Americans\", \"Baby\", and \"The Electrical Experience\", where Moorhouse also wrote the screenplay, was entered into the 1985 Cannes Film Festival; although did not receive an award.\n\nIn 2009 Frank Moorhouse was awarded the Senior Fellowship of the Zukunftskolleg at the University of Konstanz.\n\nMoorhouse has been conferred a Doctor of Letters \"honoris causa\" by the University of Sydney, and Doctor of the University by Griffith University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartini: A Memoir was published in 2005. Part autobiography, part history of the martini, the book's minimal plot involves deep conversations about the cocktail between the author and his martini-obsessed friend, V.I. Voltz, a character based on Moorhouse's friend, screenwriter Steven Katz.\n\nThe book includes love letters written by Moorhouse's ex-wife, the journalist Wendy James, to him during her time as a student in Nowra. She was deeply unhappy at their unauthorised publication and at the suggestion that she had had an affair with one of her teachers. James requested that any monies earned from the book's publication be donated to charity, suggesting that charities which aid children affected by AIDS would be suitable recipients. Moorhouse offered to return 20–30 letters to James but refused to apologise for the passages of the book dealing with the affair with the teacher saying, \"Nowhere in the book is it seriously suggested that the ex-wife – not that it's purely Wendy – ever had an affair with her teacher. This idea exists only in the mind of the character – of the demented narrator-author.\"\n\n\n\"In Australian writing, Moorhouse stands apart...\" Le Monde, Paris\n\n\"I doubt whether Frank Moorhouse, whose reputation in Australia has been built on his witty reporting of life among city-dwelling professionals and conference-goers, would expect to find himself likened to Henry James. Yet James's complicated explorations of American innocents (supposed) and their European corrupters (assumed) is strongly brought to mind in Moorhouse's duo of novels about the interwar activities of the League of Nations, of which \"Dark Palace\" is the concluding part.\"\nPeter Porter the Guardian (UK), 9 April 2002\n\n\"The chair incident is a minor but emblematic moment in \"Grand Days\", the first volume in the League-based Palais des Nations series produced by Australian writer, Frank Moorhouse. It would be a striking novel set in any period, well-written and peopled with engaging characters, but Moorhouse's choice of time frame makes \"Grand Days\" especially poignant; the hopes and idealism expressed in Geneva in the 1920s are shadowed by the reader's knowledge that the League of Nations is destined to be a noble failure.\n\n\"There is, in short, much of Henry James in this novel-the emphasis on the complexities of social interaction, on the overlooked details of life, on the clash of manners and cultures. Moorhouse, naturally, is more modern than James – one of Edith Berry Campbell's great friends is transsexual – but also more arch, giving \"Grand Days\" a humour and drollery absent from most of the master's work.\n\n\"Like James, too, Moorhouse isn't overly concerned with surface plot. When Edith, early in the novel, accepts the gift of a revolver from an odd American named Col. Strongbow, the reader expects the gun to reappear at some point; it never does, though, for few of the charged, apparently significant incidents in \"Grand Days\" have external consequences.\"\nChris Goodrich, Los Angeles Times, 5 June 1994\n\n' \"Let us drink to the discipline of indiscipline which must guide us all in every action.\" The hero announces near the start of Frank Moorhouse's wry, elliptical, funny and sad novel which like a casual outfit from a couture house, is constructed with the art that conceals art – a veritable model of dishevelled elegance.\n\n'...In between these affirmations of rigorous flexibilities a novel crammed with ideas, constructed in brief chapters crafted as finely as if they were individual short stories, threaded together with verbal echoes and emotional resonances...'\n\n'...an utterly distinctive voice—discursive, sexy, furiously sceptical, literate, desperately romantic, rude.'\n\n'...Comparisons with Milan Kundera are not out of place, although Mr Moorhouse's female characters are far more credible...his effect is unexpected, exhilarating, disorienting, sometimes hilarious...He makes you laugh, and think.'\n\nAngela Carter, New York Times (\"Forty-Seventeen\"), full page 3 review. \"[Date is being located]\"\n\n'Unlike many male writers Moorhouse is at ease writing about the way people understand and express themselves sexually...this is a stunning collection...Most of all; it's a terrific read...'\n\n'Monstrous, pathetic and hilarious...he creates admirable female characters...'\nElizabeth Ward Washington Post (\"Forty-Seventeen\") \"[Date is being located]\"\n\n'with the skill of his writing and the shrewdness of his observations about human behaviour, but by his ability to fictionalize records which might otherwise be too painful to read.

{"id": "2048621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048621", "title": "Fan Zhongyan", "text": "Fan Zhongyan\n\nFan Zhongyan (5 September 989 – 19 June 1052) from Wu County of Suzhou (Jiangsu Province, China), courtesy name Xiwen (), ratified as the Duke of Wenzheng () posthumously, and conferred as Duke of Chu () posthumously, was a Chinese poet, politician, philosopher, writer, and military strategist. Fan was one of the most prominent figures of the Song dynasty (960 - 1279), an era when China possessed the world’s largest economy and population. After serving the central government for several decades, Fan rose to a seat of Prime Minister or Chancellor over the entire Chinese empire nearing the zenith of its pre-modern economic, social, and cultural development. Fan's philosophical, educational and political legacy is one that changed the course of the Chinese history, one so powerful that it continues to exert a profound impact on the Chinese civilization today, and his philosophy and writings remain a core component of the Chinese literary canon. While Fan spent the majority of his time governing China, his myriad deeds and teachings, well represented by his well-known saying \"Be the first to bear the world's hardship, and the last to enjoy its comfort\" (), have served as an inspiration to the Chinese people for a thousand years. Fan is one of the most prominent members of the Fan family and is considered a Saint in China by some, other Saints including the philosophers Confucius and Mencius.\n\nFan Zhongyan traces his lineage to Emperor Yao, Emperor Ku, and Emperor Huang. Emperor Yao is a 5th generation descendant of Emperor Huang (or Yellow Emperor), and the second son of Emperor Ku. Often extolled as the morally perfect and intelligent sage-emperor, Emperor Yao became the founding father of the “Power Bestowing System” (), by abdicating his throne and bestowing the Emperor-hood to Shun () instead of his own children to make Shun the Emperor Shun (), an act appraised by Confucianism as “Power Bestowing” for several thousand years. Emperor Yao's benevolence and diligence served as a model to future Chinese monarchs and emperors.\n\nDuring the Zhou Dynasty, Dubo (), a 51st generation decedent of Emperor Yao, the monarch of the TangDu Kingdom and a Marquis by hereditary, exhorted the then King Zhou Xuan, and was killed by King Zhou Xuan. His family left Kingdom Zhou to other Kingdoms subsequently. Shihui (), a descendant of Dubo, later became the grand marshal and governed the Jin Kingdom (see Jin dynasty). Shihui is the first person to have “Fan” () as family name. He was conferred the name Fàn with the territory of Fan (in Henan Province today) by the King of the Jin Dynasty, and has been called Fan Wuzi (, BC 660 - BC 583, see Fan Clan since. From there, the Fan family became one of the most prominent governing families in the Jin Dynasty, and the most powerful of the six controlling families of the Jin Dynasty at the end of the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nAmong Fan Zhongyan’s famous ancestors, there is Fan Li, a prominent businessman from the Spring and Autumn period, who was the Chancellor of Kingdom Qi, a prominent statesman, military strategist, and the founding father of the Chinese commercial business who is worshiped as the \"God of Prosperity\" (or Caishen) by the Chinese. Fan Li was the lover and husband of Xi Shi, the No.1 of the renowned Four Beauties of ancient China, and said to be the most beautiful Chinese woman of all time. Fan Zhongyan's other ancestors include Fan Ju (, d. 255 BCE), a powerful chancellor of the Qin Dynasty. Fan Zhongyan is also a descendant of Fan Lübing (), a Grand Chancellor (see Grand councilor) of the Tang Dynasty. Fan Zhongyan’s close ancestors all served as officials in the imperial governments. His grandfather Fan Zanshi () famously passed the Imperial examination at age nine as a child prodigy.\n\nAll four sons of Fan Zhongyan served as officials in the imperial government of the Song Dynasty, and two of them Fan Chunren and Fan Chunli also became Chancellors of China. Among Fan Zhongyan and his sons, and the families married with Fan Zhongyan's family, together there were eight Chancellors, indicating the powerful influence of Fan Zhongyan's family on the Song Dynasty at the time.\n\n\nLiving descendants of Fan Zhongyan include Fan Lei, a famous American musician currently teaching at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China.\n\nFan Zhongyan, from Wu County of Suzhou, was born in Xu Prefecture (of Jiangsu Province) at a government residence. His father Fan Yong had been serving as an official of the government at different locations, and died in Xu Prefecture the subsequent year after Fan Zhongyan was born. Fan Zhongyan's mother Lady Xie returned to Suzhou and buried her husband at Fàn Clan's ancestral burial ground Tianping Mountain. Two years later, due to poverty and no financial means, Lady Xie remarried Zhu Wenhan (), a government official at the Wu County. Fan Zhongyan's name was subsequently changed to Zhu Yue (). Fan Zhongyan moved with step-father Zhu and mother Lady Xie to different places where Zhu took governmental posts. Always feeling grateful to step-father Zhu's kindness, Fan tried to pay back to Zhu's family after becoming very successful.\n\nFan Zhongyan studied in residence at Changbai Mountain Jiuquan Temple as a young boy. It's said he lived in hardship with very little food everyday, but he never cared about it and instead persisted on learning. He read almost all the books available at the Changbai county.\n\nAfter learning his Fan family origin as a young adult by accident, Fan Zhongyan bid farewell to his mother Lady Xie. He traveled far away to today's Shanxi province, befriended Taoist priests Zhou Debao, Qu Yingyuan, and other intellectuals such as Wang Zhu. The experience broadened Fan's views about the world. In year 1011, Fan started schooling at the Yingtian Institute (, in today's Henan Shangqiu ), the head of the Big Four Institutes (, similar to today's big four universities). He lived an austere lifestyle but studied very hard days and nights. After several years, he had mastered different classics books, and established his aspiration of being generous and taking the world as his responsibilities.\n\nIn 1015, he successfully passed the Imperial Examination and became a Jinshi, after which he returned to using the Fan surname and received his mother again to provide for her.\n\nIn the 1020s, Fan served a variety of regional posts, including as magistrate for the Jiqing Army (in modern-day Bozhou, Anhui), and as a salt store inspector in Taizhou. He then became the county magistrate of Xinghua County (in modern-day coastal Jiangsu), where with his colleague and friend Teng Zongliang he engaged in a series of dyke-building activities along the coastal counties. Not long after the completion of this project, Fan's mother died and he resigned his post for filial mourning.\n\nIn the 1030s, Fan served as the prefect of Kaifeng. While there, he took on a young Ouyang Xiu as a disciple; a partnership that would become very important a decade later. However, after criticizing the Chief Councillor of the Song state when he submitted a proposal to reform criteria used in the advancement and demotion of officials, he was demoted to regional government.\n\nIn 1038, faced with the revolt of Li Yuanhao, the court dispatched Fan along with Han Qi to Shanxi, to inspect the defences; they rendered effective support to the ending of the revolt. Fan was recalled in 1040 when the Liao and Western Xia once again threatened Song borders from the north. Fan, who had long favored a strong defense, was brought back to devise a response to the northern threat.\n\nAfter the Song granted Western Xia indemnities similar to those granted the Liao in the Treaty of Shanyuan, Fan, along with other advocates of Confucian ideals, sought reform at the court. He presented a ten-point proposal covering various aspects of government administration, including reforms to the recruitment system, higher pay for minor local officials to discourage corruption, and wider sponsorship programs to ensure that officials were drafted more on the basis of their intellect and character. However, many of the reforms that he introduced met with the opposition of conservative ministers who felt the system did not need drastic changes (and who felt threatened by the prospect of change halfway through their careers as state bureaucrats). The emperor rescinded the reforms in 1045, after Fan and his friend and colleague Ouyang Xiu had been charged with forming a faction, which was considered subversive by definition. Nevertheless, his idealist approach to governance inspired others, like the later Chancellor Wang Anshi.\n\nFan also began educational reforms in the 1040s. In the early Northern Song era, prefectural schools were neglected by the state and were left to the devices of wealthy patrons who provided private finances. While Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan issued an edict that would have a combination of government funding and private financing to restore and rebuild all prefectural schools that had fallen into disuse and abandoned since the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-960). Fan attempted to restore all county-level schools in the same manner, but did not designate where funds for the effort would be formally acquired and the decree was not taken seriously until the later Emperor Huizong of Song who expanded the county-level school system dramatically. Fan's trend of government funding for education set in motion the movement of public schools that eclipsed private academies, which would not be officially reversed until Emperor Lizong of Song in the mid 13th century.\n\nFan Zhongyan's most famous work of literature is \"Memorial to Yueyang Tower\". The descriptive prose piece was composed at the invitation of Teng Zongliang, who was then the local prefect and had rebuilt the famed ancient tower. Yueyang Lou, a city gate by the side of Dongting Lake, was known as one of the three great towers in Southern China, due to their association with famous literary works (the others being Yellow Crane Tower and Pavilion of Prince Teng).\n\nThis commemorative \"Ji\" was written in prose, with extensive usage of phrases in four, and culminates in the oft-quoted \"\". This can be translated as \"Feel concern for others \"under heaven\" before others, and rejoice after others under heaven have rejoiced\"; or \"Be the first to feel concern about the country and the last to enjoy oneself\"; or \"Bear the hardship and bitterness before others, enjoy comfort and happiness after others\".\n\nFan Zhongyan was known for his ci poetry. Among the most famous are Su Mu Zhe () and Yu Jia Ao (). Together with Su Shi, he was considered one of the founders of the \"haofang\" () school of \"ci\".\n\nFan Zhongyan and his wife who from Peng Clan () had four sons, all of whom also entered the government: \n\nFan Zhongyan had many descendants. According to the Book of Gaoping Fan Clan Genealogy (), his 9th descendant is Fan Fachuan () who lived at Meixian in Guangdong Province and truly integrated into Hakka Chinese society.\nFan Daliang (), 12th descendant from Fan Fachuan and 21st descendant from Fan Zhongyan who migrated to Nanyang or Southeast Asia and arrived in 1879 at Cirebon, West Java, Indonesia when he was 18. Fan Daliang had another spelling name in Indonesia because influenced by the spelling of the Dutch language: \"Hoan Tat Liang\" or \"Hoan Tat Liong\". The second name of Fan Daliang is Hoan Tje Huang () as a kleermaker, garment business owner, and fabric shop owner. Hoan Tat Liang had seven children by married to Sundanese women who called Arengsih or Nyai Hoan Tat Liang.\n\nSons :\n\nDaughters:\n\n\n\n"}

The 11th overall pick in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Kopitar became the first Slovenian to play in the NHL upon making his debut in 2006. Kopitar has spent his entire NHL career with the Kings, and has led the team in scoring in all but two seasons and is fifth in franchise history in points, goals, and assists. Following the 2015–16 season, he was named the Kings' captain. Noted for both his offensive and defensive play, Kopitar was awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward in the NHL in 2016, as well as the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly play the same year. He won his second Selke trophy in 2018.\n\nKopitar played junior hockey for his hometown team HK Acroni Jesenice before moving to Sweden at age 16 to play in a more competitive league. He spent one season with the junior teams of the Södertälje SK organization, and then with the senior team of the top-level Elitserien. He moved to North America to join the Kings in 2006, one year after he was drafted, and finished fourth in the Calder Memorial Trophy voting for the league's top rookie. Kopitar's offensive talent was immediately apparent when he joined the Kings, though his defensive developed in later seasons and he has become recognized for his two-way play, being a finalist for the Selke Trophy 3 times, and a Selke Trophy winner, twice. In 2018 he was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Praised as one of the best players in the League, Kopitar won the Stanley Cup championship with the Kings in 2012 and 2014, leading the playoffs in points on both occasions (tied with teammate Dustin Brown in 2012). Internationally, Kopitar has represented the Slovenian national team in several junior and senior tournaments, as well as at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. He also played for Team Europe at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nKopitar was born in Jesenice, Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) to Matjaž and Mateja Kopitar. Matjaž played hockey for HK Acroni Jesenice, winning the league title three times, and was a member of the Yugoslav and Slovenian national teams. He also coached HK Acroni Jesenice of the Austrian Hockey League during the 2006–07 season and the Slovenian national team from 2010 until 2015. Mateja worked at the family restaurant, Hrušica, a village about five kilometres from Jesenice.\n\nWhen Kopitar was four, his father first taught him how to skate; Matjaž built an ice rink in their backyard in Hrušica, and Kopitar would play there whenever he could. Kopitar has a brother, Gašper, who is five years younger. Gašper also plays hockey; when the Kopitar family moved to Los Angeles, Gašper joined a junior team sponsored by the Kings. He then played for the Portland Winterhawks of the major junior Western Hockey League (WHL) and the Des Moines Buccaneers of the United States Hockey League (USHL), before turning professional with Mora IK in Sweden. Kopitar's grandmother taught English at a local high school, and both Kopitar and his brother learned to speak English from her. Kopitar speaks five languages: Slovene, Serbian, German, Swedish, and English. He enjoys playing football and is a declared supporter of Slovenian football club NK Maribor.\n\nKopitar is renowned in Slovenia due to his hockey exploits, with a government-sponsored website declaring that after he won the Stanley Cup in 2012 he was \"the most recognised Slovenian sportsman.\" As a youth, he played in the 2000 and 2001 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a team from Slovenia. He also hosts an annual charity golf tournament that benefits various groups, mainly youths.\n\nKopitar lived with his parents until moving to Sweden, where he lived alone in an apartment. After his first season in the NHL, the rest of Kopitar's family joined him in Los Angeles; Kopitar bought a home in Manhattan Beach in 2014. Kopitar met Ines Dominc in Slovenia in 2005; they married in July 2013. Their first child, a daughter named Neža, was born on 14 March 2015. Their second child, son Jakob, was born 5 October 2016.\n\nIn 2002, Kopitar began playing for the youth team of his hometown, HK Acroni Jesenice. He split the year between the team's under-18 and junior clubs, and also appeared in 11 games for the senior team HK Kranjska Gora of the Slovenian Ice Hockey League. Kopitar had four goals and four assists in the senior league, and recorded 76 points in 14 games for the Jesenice under-18 team and 27 points in 20 games for the junior club. He led the Slovenian Ice Hockey League in scoring at the age of 16, and Swedish scout Lars Söder recruited Kopitar for the Elitserien in 2004 (Söder had originally discovered Kopitar when he was 13 at the 2001 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival in Vuokatti, Finland).\n\nThe Slovenian Ice Hockey League did not have a high enough skill level, so Kopitar decided that if he wanted to improve his career prospects, he would have to leave the country. He was offered a chance to play in Sweden for Södertälje SK, eventually joining their junior team where he led the League in scoring, with 49 points (28 goals, 21 assists) in 30 games. Prior to the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Kopitar was ranked the top European skater by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. After his first season in Sweden, he was chosen 11th overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 2005 Draft. Unlike most top-ranked prospects, Kopitar was not at the draft, but in Sweden playing in preseason games. Some members of the team had a party for the draft, including Niclas Bergfors, who was selected 23rd overall by the New Jersey Devils. Prior to the NHL Draft, Kopitar was also selected in the CHL Import Draft by the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He declined to move to North America, however, hoping to further his development by continuing to play against professionals in the Elitserien, rather than against major junior players in the WHL.\n\nKopitar signed an entry-level contract with the Kings on 7 September 2005, but returned to play in Sweden for another season. The next year, 2006, he accepted an invitation to Los Angeles' rookie camp. He made his NHL debut on 6 October 2006, against the Anaheim Ducks and scored two goals in the game. In January 2007, he was named to the NHL YoungStars Game, an event included at the All-Star Game festivities; Kopitar recorded two goals and three assists. Kopitar completed his first NHL season third among rookies in scoring, behind Evgeni Malkin and Paul Šťastný, with 20 goals and 41 assists for 61 points. It marked the fifth-highest point total by a Kings rookie, and the highest since Luc Robitaille in 1986–87. He finished fourth in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. Kopitar was awarded the Mark Bavis Memorial Award as the best first-year member of the Kings and was also named the Kings' Most Popular Player.\nThe following season, 2007–08, Kopitar was selected to represent the Western Conference at the 56th NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta, his first all-star game appearance. He was the youngest player in the game, nearly two years younger than the second-youngest player, Paul Stastny (Sidney Crosby was younger, but had to withdraw prior to the game due to injury). Kopitar finished the regular season with 32 goals and 45 assists for 77 points; he led the Kings in assists and points and was second in goals. Kopitar won the Bill Libby Memorial Award as the most valuable player on the Kings.\n\nEarly in the 2008–09 season, on 11 October 2008, Kopitar signed a seven-year contract extension with the Kings worth $47.6 million. The contract would keep Kopitar with the team until the conclusion of the 2015–16 season. He finished the season with 66 points in 82 games, leading the Kings in both assists and points, while again finishing second in goals scored. The following season, Kopitar scored his first career NHL hat-trick (3 goals in one game) on 22 October 2009 against the Dallas Stars. He finished the 2009–10 season with a career-high 34 goals and 81 points. For the second time in his career, Kopitar won the Bill Libby Memorial Award as the Kings' most valuable player, and led the team in scoring for the third-straight year. Kopitar made his Stanley Cup playoff debut that season, as the Kings qualified for the post-season for the first time since 2002. The Kings lost in the Western Conference Quarterfinals to the Vancouver Canucks, and Kopitar finished tied for third on the team with five points in six games.\nThe 2010–11 season saw Kopitar play in his 325th consecutive NHL game, which set a new Kings team record, passing Marcel Dionne on 15 March 2011. However eleven days later, Kopitar's season and ironman streak came to an abrupt end at 330 games after he suffered a broken ankle. Despite the injury setback, Kopitar led the team in scoring for the fourth straight season with 73 points, and was named the team's most valuable player for the second time. In the 2011–12 season, Kopitar led the Kings in scoring with 76 points, including a career-best 51 assists. The Kings won the Stanley Cup as playoff champions, their first title in team history. Kopitar finished tied with Kings captain Dustin Brown to lead the team in playoff scoring, with each having 20 points from 20 games played. Kopitar became the first Slovenian-born player to win the Stanley Cup. In recognition of this, Kopitar was named as the 2012 Slovenian male Athlete of the Year.\n\nThe 2012–13 NHL season was delayed due to the NHL lockout, so Kopitar joined his younger brother Gašper on Mora IK of the Swedish second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan, signing a contract with the team for the 2012–13 season. He played 31 games for Mora, scoring 34 points, before the NHL lockout ended in January 2013. A shortened, 48-game NHL season commenced, Kopitar recorded 42 points in 47 games to once again lead the Kings in scoring, and was named the team's best defensive player.\n\nThe 2013–14 season saw Kopitar lead the team in scoring for the seventh consecutive season, with 70 points, and was named both the team's most valuable player and best defensive player. He also was a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as best defensive forward in the NHL for the first time. In the playoffs, Kopitar led the entire league in scoring, recording 26 points in 26 games, as the Kings won their second Stanley Cup championship. The next season saw Kopitar tie Marcel Dionne as the only player in Kings history to lead the team in scoring eight times, having scored 16 goals and 48 assists for 64 points. Kopitar was a finalist for the Selke Trophy again, and also for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, awarded for sportsmanship.\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season Kopitar signed an eight-year contract extension with the Kings. It would pay him an average of $10 million per season until the end of the 2023–24 season. He finished the season with 74 points, setting a team record by leading the Kings in scoring for a ninth consecutive season. Kopitar also was awarded both the Lady Byng and Frank J. Selke Trophies, the first player from the Kings to win either award. He also won the Bill Libby Memorial Award as the most valuable player on the Kings for the fifth time. On 16 June 2016, Kopitar was named the captain of the Kings, replacing Dustin Brown. In his first season as captain of the Kings, Kopitar saw his production drop, and he finished with 52 points, second on the team and ending his nine-year streak of leading the team in scoring.\n\nKopitar returned to form in the 2017–18 season scoring a career high 35 goals and 57 assists for 92 points, helping the Kings get back to the playoffs. After the season, Kopitar was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy and was awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy for the second time in his career.\n\nKopitar first played in an international tournament when he participated in the Division I (second level) tournament of the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships for the Slovenian national junior team. He appeared in five games and recorded three points. The following year he appeared in the 2004 U18 tournament and the 2004 World Junior Championships. Slovenia competed in Division I at both tournaments, one level below the top division. Kopitar scored six goals and eight points in five games during the under-18 tournament and finished second overall for goals scored and third for points, leading Slovenia in both categories; at the World Juniors he had one goal and one assist in five games.\n\nIn 2005 Kopitar appeared in three international tournaments for Slovenia; he took part in the U18 Championship, World Juniors, and the senior World Championship, his first tournament with the Slovenian national team. Slovenia competed at the Division I level for both junior tournaments, but at the top level for the senior championship. He would play his last junior tournament in 2006 at the Division I level, with six points in five games. At the 2006 World Championship he played for Slovenia at the top level and recorded three goals and nine points in six games, tying for fifth among scoring leaders. Slovenia was relegated to Division I for 2007, where Kopitar had 13 assists and 14 points, leading the tournament in both categories. Back in the top division for the 2008 IIHF World Championship, Kopitar appeared in five games and had four points to lead his team, though Slovenia was once again relegated.\n\nSlovenia qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi; as the qualifying games were held during the NHL season Kopitar was unable to participate, though his father Matjaž coached the team and Gašper played in the matches. Though Gašper was part of the team that secured qualification for Slovenia, he was not named to the Olympic roster. Kopitar helped Slovenia reach the quarterfinals of the tournament by scoring two goals and one assist.\n\nKopitar was also named to play in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey for Team Europe, which includes players from most of Europe (the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, and Sweden have their own teams). Prior to the announcement Kopitar had expressed excitement towards the concept, which was to be introduced during the tournament, noting that as a Slovenian he had few opportunities to play in tournaments like this.\n\nKopitar is known in the NHL as one of the most effective two-way forwards, in that he is effective both as an offensive and defensive player. He won the Frank J. Selke Trophy, which is given to the best defensive forward in the NHL, in 2016, after being a finalist for the award in both 2014 and 2015. He is known for being skilled at taking faceoffs, with one of the highest averages in the league during his career. He is also skilled at offence, and led the Kings in team scoring from 2008 until 2016.\n\n\n"}

The ill-fated Donner Party infamously took that route.\n\nA sentence in Hastings' guidebook briefly describes the cutoff:\n\nThe most direct route, for the California emigrants, would be to leave the Oregon route, about two hundred miles east from Fort Hall; thence bearing West Southwest, to the Salt Lake; and thence continuing down to the bay of St. Francisco, by the route just described.\nThe cutoff left the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger in Wyoming, passed through the Wasatch Range, across the Great Salt Lake Desert, an 80-mile waterless drive, looped around the Ruby Mountains, and rejoined the California Trail about seven miles west of modern Elko (also Emigrant Pass).\n\nThe west end of the cutoff is marked as Nevada Historical Marker 3.\n\nHastings led a small party overland late in 1845 and spent the winter in California. Significantly, his stay at Sutter's Fort coincided with a visit by John C. Frémont, who had just explored the Great Salt Lake Desert and whose letter describing a new route to California would be widely published in Eastern newspapers. In April, Hastings set out with a few companions to meet the emigration of 1846. He stayed in the vicinity of the Sweetwater River while an eastbound traveler carried his open letter inviting emigrants on the California Trail to meet him at Fort Bridger. Between 60 and 75 wagons did so and traveled with Hastings on his cutoff. They endured a difficult descent down Weber Canyon, a waterless drive of 80 miles across the Great Salt Lake Desert, and a lengthy detour around the Ruby Mountains. Despite the usual trials of overland travel, they arrived safely in California.\nThe Donner Party, following in the wake of this initial party in 1846, had an unsuccessful experience with the Hastings Cutoff. They had arrived about a week late to travel with Hastings' party, and on his suggestion pioneered an alternate route to avoid Weber Canyon. The roadbuilding required through the Wasatch Mountains and the grueling Great Salt Lake Desert delayed them. When they had arrived at the California Trail, they were delayed about a month. The party arrived at Donner Pass just as an early winter storm rendered it impassable. After becoming snowbound in the Sierra Nevada, many died of starvation, and some of the emigrants resorted to eating their animals and the deceased members of the group.\n\nIn July 1847, Mormon leader Brigham Young led a vanguard company of emigrants from Winter Quarters, in what is now Omaha, to the future site of Salt Lake City. The company chose to use the Hastings Cutoff passing through modern-day Emigration Canyon. Young's group made remarkable improvements to some parts of the cutoff on their journey so subsequent Mormon companies could more easily make it through to the Salt Lake valley. William Clayton, the company's scribe, stated in his journals that the company tried to follow the route left by the Donner Party the previous year, yet only occasionally could identify the tracks.\n\nThe California gold rush created an enormous increase in westward traffic and several parties of 1849 and 1850 used the Hastings Cutoff. The year 1850 saw the development of a new route called the Salt Lake Cutoff that avoided the Great Salt Lake Desert west of the lake. Subsequently, the Hastings Cutoff was abandoned, except for portions east of Salt Lake City, where it remained as the end of the Mormon Trail.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first published in 1919 in the journal \"Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse\" and then, after translation into English by Dorian Feigenbaum, in the \"Psychoanalytic Quarterly\" in 1933.\n\nThe paper describes Tausk's observations and psychoanalytic interpretation of paranoid delusion that occurs in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The delusion often involves their being influenced by a \"diabolical machine\", just outside the technical understanding of the victim, that influences them from afar. It is typically believed to be operated by a group of people who are persecuting the individual, whom Tausk suggested were \"to the best of my knowledge, almost exclusively of the male sex\" and the persecutors \"predominantly physicians by whom the patient has been treated\".\n\nThese delusions are known in contemporary psychiatry as \"passivity delusions\" or \"passivity phenomena\" and are listed among Kurt Schneider's 'first rank' symptoms which are thought to be particularly diagnostic of schizophrenia, and still form some of the core diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe schizophrenic influencing machine is a machine of mystical nature. The patients are able to give only vague hints of its construction. It consists of boxes, cranks, levers, wheels, buttons, wires, batteries, and the like. Patients endeavor to discover the construction of the apparatus by means of their technical knowledge, and it appears that with the progressive popularization of the sciences, all the forces known to technology are utilized to explain the functioning of the apparatus. All the discoveries of mankind, however, are regarded as inadequate to explain the marvelous powers of this machine, by which the patients feel themselves persecuted.\nThe main effects of the influencing machine are the following:\n\n\nThe most well-known example of an influencing machine is that of James Tilly Matthews who believed he was being controlled \"body and mind\" by a device called the \"Air Loom.\" Matthews was a tea merchant and political activist before he was admitted to the Bethlem Royal Hospital (Bedlam) after shouting \"treason\" in the British House of Commons in 1797. He was a prolific writer and artist and described the \"air loom\" in great detail. His descriptions were published as a book in 1810 by John Haslam entitled \"Illustrations of Madness\".\n\nIn the novel \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", the narrator, \"Chief\" Bromden, believes that the psychiatric ward in which he is committed (including the staff) is a machine in the service of a broader \"Combine\" - his name for technological society. This portrayal has been described as one of the best-known fictional examples of an \"influencing machine\" patient.\n\n\"Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television\" by Jerry Mander (1978).\nActivist Jerry Mander's book argues for the complete removal of television from our lives because of its ill effects. Mander gives the example of Tausk's \"Influencing machine\" as being a parallel for television: \"Doubtless you have noticed that this 'influencing machine' sounds an awful lot like television ... In any event, there is no question that television does what the schizophrenic fantasy says it does. It places in our minds images of reality which are outside our experience. The pictures come in the form of rays from a box. They cause changes in feeling and ... utter confusion as to what is real and what is not.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2048736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048736", "title": "Steven Greenberg (rabbi)", "text": "Steven Greenberg (rabbi)\n\nSteven Greenberg (born June 19, 1956) is an American rabbi with a rabbinic ordination from the Orthodox rabbinical seminary of Yeshiva University (RIETS). He is described as the first openly gay Orthodox Jewish rabbi, since he publicly disclosed he was gay in an article in the Israeli newspaper \"Maariv\" in 1999 and participated in a 2001 documentary film about homosexual men and women raised in the Orthodox Jewish world.\n\nGreenberg is a Senior Teaching Fellow and Director of Diversity Project at CLAL – the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership, and the author of the book \"Wrestling with God and Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition\" which received the Koret Jewish Book Award for Philosophy and Thought in 2005.\n\nIn 2011, Greenberg performed a same-sex commitment ceremony, but he believes that formal kiddushin for same-sex couples is against Jewish law. \n\nHe was listed number 44 in the 2012 \"The Daily Beast\" and \"Newsweek\" list of \"America's Top 50 Rabbis for 2012\".\n\nGreenberg, the son of Conservative Jewish parents, was raised in Columbus, Ohio. When he was about 15, he began studying with an Orthodox rabbi. He attended Yeshiva University in New York as an undergraduate and then as a rabbinical student. When he was 20, he went to study at the Yeshivat Har Etzion, a hesder yeshiva in Alon Shvut in Gush Etzion near Jerusalem. He received his BA in philosophy from Yeshiva University, and his rabbinic ordination from the rabbinical seminary of Yeshiva University (RIETS) in 1983.\n\nWhile at Yeshivat Har Etzion, he was attracted to a fellow student and concluded that he was bisexual. He went to consult with rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, a respected old rabbi in Jerusalem, telling him: \"Harav, I am attracted to both men and women. What shall I do?\" And the rabbi replied according to Greenberg: \"My dear one, my friend, then you have twice the power of love. Use it carefully.\" Greenberg remembers that he left with the trust that it would all work out. However, he realised that the rabbi wasn't permitting him to have sex with men, but was telling him that his desire was not ugly in and of itself.\n\nGreenberg did not acknowledge he was gay until he was 28, and even afterwards continued to date women for another seven years. In 1993, he wrote the article \"Gayness and God\", admitting he was gay, and published it under the pseudonym \"Yaakov Levado\" (meaning Jacob alone) in \"Tikkun\" magazine, but only came out six years later in an article titled \"In the name of partnership\" published in the Israeli daily newspaper \"Maariv\" on March 5, 1999.\n\nEarly in his career, Greenberg held an Orthodox pulpit on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Since 1985, he has been a Senior Teaching Fellow and Director of the Diversity Project at CLAL – the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership, an interdenominational Jewish think tank, leadership training institute, and resource center. He is a co-founder and director of Eshel, a support, education and advocacy organization for orthodox LGBT Jews that saves lives and families. He is also on the faculty of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, a project of the Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998 he spent two years as a Jerusalem Fellow with the Mandel Institute, studying educational policy issues and researching rabbinic attitudes toward homosexuality. Greenberg participated in the critically acclaimed 2001 documentary film \"Trembling Before G-d\", featured at the Sundance Festival. The film about gay men and women raised in the orthodox Jewish world helped break the silence around homosexuality in religious Jewish circles.\n\nOn November 10, 2011, Greenberg officiated a civil marriage according to the laws of the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C. It was widely misreported Greenberg performed a religious ceremony; Greenberg has repeatedly agreed that same gender kiddushin is incompatible with Jewish law.\n\nGreenberg officiating at a civil marriage between two orthodox men in the United States, first reported by \"+972 Magazine\" on November 11, 2011, attracted controversy and was misunderstood and rejected by many within the orthodox Jewish community. Many were confused and thought that he had performed the rites of a Jewish wedding (kiddushin).\n\nGreenberg described the wedding as a \"same-sex commitment ceremony\", commenting that \"while it was a wedding according to the laws of the District of Columbia, it was not a kiddushin,\" adding \"my position was and still is that kiddushin is not appropriate for same-sex couples.\" Two weeks later, he wrote in an article in the \"Jewish Week\", \"I did not conduct a 'gay Orthodox wedding'. I officiated at a ceremony that celebrated the decision of two men to commit to each other in love and to do so in binding fashion before family and friends. Though it was a legal marriage according to the laws of the District of Columbia, as far as Orthodox Jewish law (halacha) is concerned, there was no kiddushin (Jewish wedding ceremony) performed.\"\n\nOn December 5, 2011, in response to the ceremony, more than 100 orthodox rabbis signed a statement calling gay marriage a \"desecration of Torah values\", saying: \"We, as rabbis from a broad spectrum of the Orthodox community around the world, wish to correct the false impression that an Orthodox-approved same-gender wedding took place. By definition, a union that is not sanctioned by Torah law is not an Orthodox wedding, and by definition a person who conducts such a ceremony is not an Orthodox rabbi.\"\n\nGreenberg currently lives in Boston with his family.\nGreenberg has been a frequent commentator for the media and has published several articles on Jewish law and church and state issues.\n\nIn a 2001 article \"Between Intermarriage and Conversion: Finding a Middle Way\" published in CLAL, Greenberg proposes using the rabbinic concept of \"ger toshav\", (resident alien), to provide an accepted place for non-Jewish partners of intermarried couples, allowing them to experience \"the joys of living in a Jewish home without insisting on conversion\". As a marriage of a Jew and a ger toshav would not be legitimate under halachic law, Greenberg suggests using \"cultural creativity\" to find \"new rituals that partake of Jewish resources and speak honestly about what is actually happening\", the same as for gay couples, where in his opinion \"kiddushin, the traditional ritual for the Jewish wedding, simply doesn't apply\".\n\nIn 2004 Greenberg's book, \"Wrestling with God and Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition\" was published, meeting with critical acclaim. In particular it addressed permitted and forbidden sexual behaviour: \"While the common understanding of the verse 'Thou shall not lie with a male as one lies with a woman' [] has been taken to refer to both active and passive partners ... it would appear that the verse directly refers only to the active partner engulfing his penis in the body of another man. According to this analysis the verse prohibits one, and only one, sexual practice between men, namely, anal intercourse, and speaks specifically to the active partner. There is no mention of any other behavior that this verse would prohibit.\" In Greenberg's reading \"the verse prohibits the kind of sex between men that is designed to effect the power and mastery of the penetrator. Sex for the conquest, for shoring up the ego, for selfaggrandizement, or worse, for the perverse pleasure of demeaning another man is prohibited,\" and he adds that reading Leviticus 18:22 \"as a law against sexual domination and appropriation ... offers gay people a way to reconnect to God, Torah, and the Jewish people\". Greenberg says that he interprets the passage in this way \"because it offers me a way of coming back to Judaism. It's a radical reading, but if you believe that God hates what you are, why would you go to such a temple?\"\n\nIn addition to it, Greenberg's interpretation of Leviticus 18:22, \"the very verse that was for centuries read as requiring the ongoing demotion of women through the marking of intercourse as humiliation and thus femininity as degraded could be read as a full-fledged critique of the maledominated social hierarchy! The only way to redeem intercourse from its inevitable dominations is to press for gender equality on the deepest of emotional planes, to work formally toward ending the gender hierarchy, and to heal the ugly misogyny at its foundation\".\n\n\"Wrestling with God and Men\" received the 2005 Koret Jewish Book Award for Philosophy and Thought, considered one of the highest honors for authors writing prose on Jewish themes, and was a finalist for the 17th Annual Lambda Literary Awards.\n\nSome orthodox Jews have criticized Rabbi Greenberg and questioned his orthodox credentials. After Greenberg came out, Rabbi Moshe Tendler, Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University stated: \"Being an Orthodox Rabbi and actively gay is an oxymoron ... [It is] the exact same as if he said, 'I'm an Orthodox rabbi and I eat ham sandwiches on Yom Kippur'. In Tendler's opinion \"it is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society\" and called Greenberg \"a Reform rabbi\".\nCommenting on Greenberg's role in \"Trembling before God\", Rabbi Avi Shafran, a public relations professional for Agudath Israel of America who scolded the movie for not showing Orthodox Jews who have undergone conversion therapy to change their sexual inclinations, wrote: \"Rabbi Steve Greenberg, billed as 'the first openly gay Orthodox rabbi'[, a]ddressing the Torah's strong prohibition of male homosexual acts, ... suggests to the camera, without elaboration: 'There are other ways of reading the Torah'. What Rabbi Greenberg apparently believes is that elements of the Jewish religious tradition are negotiable, that the Torah, like a Hollywood script, can be sent back for a rewrite. That approach can be called many things, but 'Orthodox' is not among them.\"\n\nIn his review of \"Wrestling with God and Men\" for the Edah Journal, Rabbi Asher Lopatin affirmed Greenberg's \"importance as a voice within the Orthodox community\", and calls him \"a brilliant, thoughtful and courageous rabbi\" and his book \"a brilliant work of creativity and research\", he writes that \"\"Wrestling with God and Man\" [sic], and Rabbi Greenberg's voice in this book fall outside the bounds of Orthodoxy\" for three reasons: Because Greenberg \"is not committing himself fully to Orthodoxy\", because he \"does not follow Orthodox methodology\", and because he \"is not sufficiently halakhically creative\", not having \"combined — in a novel way to be sure — [his] commitment to his homosexual identity and way of life with the binding nature of halakhah\". At the same time, Lopatin is confident, that \"Greenberg can write the Orthodox book that will show us that he is committed to staying the long and difficult course of persuasion that Orthodoxy demands\".\n\n"}

It is visible for from the air and it sits above the city of Roanoke.\n\nIn 1949, the Roanoke Merchants Association decided to kick off that year's Christmas shopping season by having a neon star built on top of Mill Mountain. Although the structure was always intended to be a permanent addition, the merchants at first weren't sure if the star should be lit year round. When the star immediately became very popular, the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants Association decided to keep it lit all year. The Merchants Association is credited with the construction of the star, but no single person claimed credit.\n\nInitially, the star was illuminated in all-white. Later, the star's color would change from white to red to indicate a traffic fatality on that day. As part of the bicentennial celebration in 1976, the design was changed to an outer single star of red encompassing inner double-stars of white and blue. Generally all the colors have been lit at once, but occasionally the colors have been lit in a repeating sequence: each color shows exclusively for a second or two, or in succession. To commemorate a tragic event, the red outer star has been used alone, in a manner akin to a lowered flag. Such commemorations have been made for national and local events. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the star was kept in a red, white, and blue configuration for nearly six years, until April 2007.\n\nOn August 12, 2006, the star was turned off for eight days for the city to perform significant electrical upgrades. Outdated junction boxes, transformers, wiring, and conduits were replaced. Many of these devices are from the star's original 1949 construction. The upgrades cost $100,000. The work is expected to save the city more money in the long run due to a reduced need for maintenance.\nOn April 17, 2007, the star had to be turned off because one of the power lines had been heavily damaged by a tree. When the star was relit on April 22, 2007, officials changed the color configuration to all-white \"as a symbol of hope\" after the Virginia Tech massacre.\n\nRed, white and blue colors were restored May 24, 2007 and remained that way until returning to all white on September 12, 2011.\n\nThe Mill Mountain Star is tall with 2,000 feet of neon tubing. It requires 17,500 watts of power to illuminate the neon tubes, so it puts out a pleasant little hum. Roy C. Kinsey of Kinsey Sign Company built the neon tubes with his three sons Roy Jr., Bob, and Warren. It was assembled near a local airplane hangar to study how it looked. Then it was driven to the top of the mountain and placed onto a steel structure. Robert L. Little was the Structural Engineer for Roanoke Iron & Bridge Works at the time and helped on the project as well.\n\nCertain sections of the original red neon tubing still exist, while all of the white and blue sections have been replaced. Most maintenance on the star today involves the replacement of transformers and the repairing of circuit breakers.\n\nThe star was \"lit\" by Mayor A.R. Minton on November 23, 1949. Minton threw a \"ceremonial\" dummy switch, and Bob Kinsey flipped the actual switch behind the circuit breaker. \"Congressman Clifton A. Woodrum dedicated the star with the Biblical text, 'When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.' Mayor A. R. Minton threw the switch to light the star, and Greene Memorial Methodist Choir sang 'America' and 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' James H. Moore, manager of WSLS-TV, was the master of ceremonies.\"\n\nDirectly in front of the star is an overlook that features dramatic views of the Roanoke Valley and, particularly, downtown Roanoke. The overlook is a well known place to photograph Roanoke. It is also a site where area residents take visiting friends and relatives.\n\nA small zoo was built near the star on the summit of Mill Mountain. Mill Mountain Zoo was originally designated as strictly a children's zoo, but the number of exhibits and variety of animals has expanded. The star, overlook, and zoo are accessible both from Roanoke and from a spur of the Blue Ridge Parkway at Roanoke Mountain. There are numerous hiking trails to the star, and from the star to the zoo.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1929, an inclined railway ran from near the current location of Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital to the mountain's summit. The path of the incline is still visible today. The primary destination was an inn. A group dedicated to making Roanoke an attractive community for 40-year-olds has proposed rebuilding the inn. David Bowers, former mayor, stated opposition to the park building proposal in his campaign, as did the Roanoke chapter of the Sierra Club and the Roanoke Valley Preservation Foundation.\n\nThe star and the park around it are popular picnic spots by day. They are also popular hangouts at night.\n\nMill Mountain's summit is feet above sea level.\n\n"}

{"id": "2048766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048766", "title": "Iron Monkey (1993 film)", "text": "Iron Monkey (1993 film)\n\nIron Monkey is a 1993 Hong Kong martial arts film written and produced by Tsui Hark and directed by Yuen Woo-ping, starring Donnie Yen, Yu Rongguang, Jean Wang, Angie Tsang and Yuen Shun-yi. It is not related to the 1977 Hong Kong film of the same title.\n\nThe film is a fictionalised account of an episode in the childhood of the Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung and his father Wong Kei-ying, and their encounter with the \"Iron Monkey\". In 1996, a separate film entitled \"Iron Monkey 2\" was released, but it was not a sequel to this film.\n\nThe plot centers on a masked martial artist known as Iron Monkey. Iron Monkey is actually the alter ego of a traditional Chinese medicine physician called Yang Tianchun. In the day, Yang runs his clinic and provides free medical treatment for the poor, which he subsidises by charging his rich patients. At night, he dresses in black and travels around town to rob the rich and help the poor. Once, he breaks into the governor's residence and makes off with a hoard of gold. The guards and four Shaolin monks are unable to stop him. The governor orders the chief constable, Fox, to hunt down Iron Monkey and to arrest anyone who is linked to him in any way. Fox appears to be a bungler who is not aware that Iron Monkey is actually the physician treating his injured men who fought with Iron Monkey the previous night.\n\nIn the meantime, Wong Kei-ying, also a physician and martial artist from Foshan, arrives in town with his young son, Wong Fei-hung. Wong Kei-ying fights with street thugs who attempt to rob him. Some soldiers who have been observing the fight nearby suspect that Wong is Iron Monkey, and they arrest him and his son. During the trial, the governor orders Wong Fei-hung to be branded for defiance, but Iron Monkey shows up and disrupts the proceedings. Wong Kei-ying is eager to prove his innocence, and he fights with Iron Monkey. Neither of them is able to defeat his opponent, and Iron Monkey escapes. The governor is impressed by Wong Kei-ying's skill, and he holds Wong Fei-hung hostage to force Wong Kei-ying to help him capture Iron Monkey within seven days.\n\nThe locals despise Wong Kei-ying for assisting the governor in capturing their hero, so they refuse to sell him food or provide him with shelter. Wong eventually arrives at Yang's clinic and is taken in by Yang and Miss Orchid, while he is still unaware of Yang's true identity. With help from Fox, Yang manages to bring Wong Fei-hung, who has fallen sick, out of prison and keeps him in his clinic. Wong Fei-hung learns new martial arts from Yang and Miss Orchid during his stay with them.\n\nMeanwhile, a Shaolin traitor named Hin-hung, who has become an imperial official, arrives in town with his followers. Hin-hung takes over as the new governor. Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying run into Hin-hung and his men in two separate encounters, and they are severely wounded by him. They retreat back to the clinic, where Wong is surprised to discover that Yang is actually Iron Monkey. They assist each other and recover from their wounds quickly. Concurrently, Hin-hung orders his men to search the town for Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying, but Fox gets to the clinic first to warn Orchid. It turns out that Fox has known Iron Monkey's true identity all along, and he has been secretly helping Iron Monkey.\n\nHin-hung's monks eventually find their way to the clinic, and they engage Orchid in a fight. When Orchid proves far too skillful for the monks, they drug her and attempt to rape her. She is saved by Wong Fei-hung, who continues the battle with the monks using the staff movements he learn from Yang and Orchid. Although Wong Fei-hung is able to defeat the Hin-hung's best monks, he is captured and tortured. Orchid escapes to warn Wong Kei-ying and Iron Monkey.\n\nIron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying (also wearing the Iron Monkey costume) break into the governor's residence to rescue Wong Fei-hung and defeat Hin-hung's men and monks. They have a final confrontation with Hin-hung on top of burning wooden poles. After an intense fight, Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying defeat Hin-hung and knock him down into the inferno below. At the end of the film, the protagonists learn that a new governor has taken office, and they hope that he will be a good official. The Wongs leave town for Foshan while Yang and Orchid see them off. Fox says that he would like to visit the Wongs, but that he is too busy \"trying to catch that Iron Monkey\". After the film, screen captions inform viewers that Yang and Orchid are married, and that Wong Fei-hung, inspired by his father and the Iron Monkey, later becomes a hero among the Chinese and restores honor to the Shaolin Monastery.\n\n\nThe film's domestic release was delayed due to producer Tsui Hark's insistence on filming some additional comedic scenes after Yuen Woo-ping had finished the film. According to an interview with Tsui on the \"Iron Monkey\" DVD release, this delay may have had a negative effect on the film's box office earnings.\n\nThe film was given a wide release in the United States by Miramax Films, backed by director Quentin Tarantino. It opened in October 2001 on 1,225 screens, earning just over $6 million in its opening weekend and more than $14 million overall. It received good reviews in America and became the 11th highest-grossing foreign language film in the United States. The film received favorable reviews from critics and holds a 90% rating on the film review website Rotten Tomatoes. The film was ranked #99 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\nIn its release in 2001, numerous controversial edits and changes were made to the film for the United States release, to the dismay of Hong Kong cinema fans.Miramax made several changes that the company felt would make the film more marketable to American audiences:\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, the film was initially released by Megastar (later Deltamac) in a basic version. This version was released in the United States by Tai Seng. Later, it was re-released in Hong Kong by IVL in a digitally remastered edition in the \"Donnie Yen & Yuen Woo Ping Action Collection\".\n\nOn 26 March 2001, the DVD was released by Hong Kong Legends in the United Kingdom in region 2. On 1 March 2004, the DVD for the film was released in a two-disc platinum edition. One year later, the Epic Action Collection DVD was released on 26 December 2005 in a four-disc set, which includes two other martial arts films - \"Wing Chun\" and \"Tai Chi Boxer\" - also directed by Yuen Woo-ping. Five months later, The Donnie Yen Collection DVD was released on 29 May 2006 in a four-disc set, which includes another two martial arts films - \"New Dragon Gate Inn\" and \"Once Upon a Time in China II\". Miramax (with assistance from Lionsgate on some versions) released their version on DVD in the United States and also on Blu-ray on 15 September 2009, with the English audio in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the Chinese audio in Dolby Digital 5.1.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2048773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048773", "title": "Letter beacon", "text": "Letter beacon\n\nLetter beacons are radio transmissions of uncertain origin and unknown purpose, consisting of only a single repeating Morse code letter. They have been classified into a number of groups according to transmission code and frequency, and it is supposed that the source for most of them is Russia.\n\nLetter beacons have been referred to as:\n\nThese radio transmissions were discovered in the late 1960s. Their presence became known to the wider amateur radio community in 1978, when beacon \"W\" started transmitting on 3584 kHz, in the 80 meters band. There is indirect evidence that this particular transmitter was located in Cuba.\n\nIn 1982 there were also reports, supposedly based on HF direction finding by the US military, that beacon \"K\" transmitting on 9043 kHz was located at , near the city of Khabarovsk in the USSR. A few years later, it was suggested that the \"K\" beacons were actually located at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula and the \"U\" beacons were located at the Barents Sea coast, between Murmansk and Amderma.\n\nAccording to D.W. Schimmel, in 1986 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released the following HF direction finding results for single letter beacons, all of which indicate locations in the USSR:\n\nThe link with the USSR and, more recently, Russia is further supported by the existence of single letter beacons transmitting letters existing only in the Cyrillic Morse code alphabet.\n\nThe ENIGMA group also accepted these locations for cluster beacons \"C\", \"D\", \"P\" and \"S\", adding Vladivostok for beacon \"F\".\n\nA recent source (2006) regarding locations was published on the Web by Ary Boender. This publication also contains an extensive list of letter beacon frequencies, both current and historical. The following locations are given for cluster beacons:\n\nFor solitary beacons and markers, Boender suggests these locations:\n\nTransmissions of the \"P\" beacon in December 2007, even on medium frequency (420 and 583 kHz), suggest the Russian naval base at Kaliningrad as a possible source. Kaliningrad officially uses the ITU registered call sign \"RMP\".\n\nThe single letter beacons can be classified into two groups, \"cluster beacons\" and \"channel markers\". A beacon \"P\" exists in both groups. A third group, called FSK beacons, is now extinct. The following sections list the beacons active as of December 2007, according to published listeners’ reports.\n\nA group of radio beacons with single-letter identifiers (\"C\", \"D\", \"M\", \"S\", \"P\", \"A\", \"M\" and \"K\") have been regularly reported near 3594, 4558, 5154, 7039, 8495, 10872, 13528, 16332 and 20048 kHz. The term \"cluster beacons\" is frequently used for them, as they transmit in parallel on frequencies only 0.1 kHz apart. These beacons transmit only their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.\n\nThe following call signs and frequencies of cluster beacons have been reported recently (September 2007 to November 2008) in Numbers&Oddities newsletter, Utility DX Forum and ENIGMA-2000:\n\nOccasionally, some cluster beacons (especially \"F\" and \"M\") have been reported transmitting on frequencies different from their regular channel for short periods.\n\nA second family of letter beacons includes all those operating outside the clusters. For this reason, they are often called \"solitary beacons\" or \"solitaires\". They also transmit their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.\n\nA few solitary beacons, like \"R\" on 4325.9 and 5465.9 kHz, operate exactly like the cluster beacons, sending only their single letter identifier.\n\nHowever, the majority of solitary beacons, most notably \"P\" on various MF and HF frequencies, transmit their single-letter identifier in Morse code. Sometimes the routine transmission is interrupted and brief messages are sent in fast Morse code or in an FSK digital mode. Therefore, a more appropriate term for these beacon-like single-letter transmissions is \"channel markers\", as their purpose is to occupy and identify a particular HF transmission channel when no traffic is transmitted. There is no evidence that the cluster beacon \"P\" and the solitary beacon \"P\" are directly related.\n\nIt was reported in \"Numbers and Oddities\", issue 142, that beacon C on 8000 kHz also transmitted messages under the regular call sign RIW, which is allocated to a Russian naval communication station in Khiva, Uzbekistan.\n\nThere are also a few oddities transmitting signals with poor modulation and irregular timing, like \"V\" on 5342 and 6430.7 kHz.\n\nThe following call signs and frequencies of solitary beacons and markers have been reported recently (September 2007 to September 2009) in Numbers&Oddities newsletter, Utility DX Forum and ENIGMA-2000:\n\nThis group includes the \"K\" and \"U\" beacons, which are no longer active. They transmitted their Morse code single letter identification by shifting the frequency of the carrier by approximately 1000 Hz. This mode of \"FSK-CW\" is designated F1A. The use of FSK indicated that the transmitter was suitable for FSK data transmissions, like radioteletype.\n\nENIGMA devised a naming scheme for all stations in their sphere of interest. In the original scheme, the following identifications were issued to letter beacons:\n\nENIGMA-2000, the Internet-based ENIGMA successor group, revised the original ENIGMA designators. The current designations for letter beacons are the following (since 2007):\n\nThe purpose of the letter beacons is not yet known with certainty. Many theories have appeared in specialized publications, but none is based on documentary evidence. They have been postulated to be radio propagation beacons, channel markers, or beacons used in tracking satellites or for civil defense purposes. Some stations of this family, in particular the \"U\" beacon, have been implicated in deliberate jamming.\n\nAccording to ENIGMA, cluster beacons are used by the Russian navy (especially its submarine branch) to find the most suitable radio frequency for contact based on current radio propagation conditions.\n\nRobert Connolly also links \"P\" channel marker with communications facilities at the Russian naval base of Kaliningrad. \"P\" transmissions carrying Russian navy \"XXX\" (flash priority) Morse code messages with call signs \"RPM\" and \"RDL\" further support this view.\n\nA few aero navigation non-directional beacons also transmit single letter identification codes. They can be easily distinguished from letter beacons because they transmit in the allocated low frequency and medium frequency bands; most of them are listed in appropriate aviation handbooks and their transmission mode is A2A (full carrier with audio modulation).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2048780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048780", "title": "Safe at Home", "text": "Safe at Home\n\nSafe at Home is a 1968 album by country rock group the International Submarine Band, led by the then-unknown 21-year-old Gram Parsons. The group's only album release, \"Safe at Home\" featured four of Parsons' original compositions rounded out by six covers of classic country and rock and roll songs made famous by the likes of Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, and Hank Snow. Described as \"hippie and hillbilly in equal measure\", the album helped to forge the burgeoning country rock movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nRecording of \"Safe at Home\" began in July 1967 for Lee Hazlewood's LHI Records, with the group's official lineup consisting solely of Parsons and lead guitarist John Nuese. Session musicians rounded out the lineup for recording: drummer Jon Corneal, bassist Joe Osborn, pedal steel guitarist Jay Dee Maness and pianist Earl \"Les\" Ball. Hazlewood's girlfriend Suzi Jane Hokom was assigned by LHI to produce the album. Corneal, a childhood friend of Parsons, soon joined the band as a full member. Recorded during these initial sessions were the Parsons originals \"Blue Eyes\" and \"Luxury Liner\", soon issued on a 45 single. With the additions of guitarist Bob Buchanan and bassist Chris Ethridge, the group gigged around the west coast over the next few months. Ethridge and Parsons would play together often in the coming years, with both the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Fallen Angels.\n\nFour months later, with the group's line-up consisting of Parsons, Nuese, Corneal and Buchanan (augmented by Ball, Maness and Ethridge) the group again entered the studio and recorded two new Parsons-penned originals, \"Strong Boy\" and \"Do You Know How It Feels To Be Lonesome\" along with seven covers, six of which ended up on the original album. By early December, the album was finished and given a target release date of late January or early February 1968, in order to avoid the Christmas rush.\n\nPrior to its release, Parsons left the band after accepting an offer to join The Byrds, and \"Safe at Home\" lay dormant for months. According to Corneal, Parsons became so caught up in his new role in The Byrds that he barely acknowledged \"Safe at Home\" as its release approached. \"I don't think he wanted to look back, but just keep going in the direction he wanted to go\", said Corneal. Rock journalist John Einarson surmised decades later that Parsons abandoned his band and his friends without a second thought once the opportunity to join The Byrds was presented to him.\n\nAfter months of legal wrangling, with the group unable to find a suitable replacement for Parsons, the album was finally released. Though Hazelwood saw no point in devoting a promotional budget to a band which essentially no longer existed and were unavailable to promote the album, \"Safe at Home\" nonetheless received rave reviews from the likes of Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard, and Don Everly. \"The album got buried\", according to producer Hokom, who noted that Hazelwood was a musician first and foremost and not a businessman, and he may have erred in failing to market the release.\n\nAs part of the legal settlement resulting from Parsons' abrupt departure from The International Submarine Band, The Byrds' 1968 album \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" had much of Parsons' lead vocals removed and re-recorded by Roger McGuinn. This would be one of Parsons' chief gripes about his tenure in the group, and by the time \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" was released in August, 1968, Parsons had already moved on to form The Flying Burrito Brothers.\n\nWhile compiling material for a 2001 , the lost track \"Knee Deep in the Blues\" (originally a single by Marty Robbins in 1957) from the \"Safe at Home\" sessions was re-discovered and issued on that anthology, as well as on the 2004 compact disc re-release of \"Safe at Home\" (the original mid-1980s CD pressing having been on the tiny Shiloh Records).\n\nReviews of \"Safe at Home\" have been mixed but generally positive. Upon its 1968 release, renowned music journalist Robert Christgau seemed pleasantly surprised by the notion of \"four smiling longhairs\" playing skillful country music, referring to the album as \"a good record and a brilliant conception.\" Parsons' future Byrds and Flying Burrito Brothers' bandmate Chris Hillman referred to the album as \"sort of fluff now. It's light weight. Gram had not quite developed into the soulful guy he was going to be.\" \"Hit Parader\" magazine gave the album high marks for daring to tackle country music, an area that most contemporary American groups wouldn't touch in the liberal heyday of the late 1960s.\n\nWriter Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times described the album as authentic, noting a \"vitality not always found in traditional country performers\". Rock journalist John Einarson wrote in his 2008 book \"Hot Burritos: The True Story of The Flying Burrito Brothers\" that the album is \"hardly the cutting-edge country-rock classic it is often claimed to be, nor is it groundbreaking\", though he also noted a sincerity to the band's approach which preserves the spirit of the country & western genre.\n\n\"Blue Eyes\", the album's opening track, was covered in 1993 by American alternative country pioneers Uncle Tupelo. It saw release on the \"Conmemorativo: A Tribute to Gram Parsons\" compilation album. Parsons himself re-recorded \"Do You Know How It Feels to Be Lonesome\" (with the title shortened to \"Do You Know How It Feels\") with The Flying Burrito Brothers on the 1969 album \"The Gilded Palace of Sin\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2048786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048786", "title": "Oak processionary", "text": "Oak processionary\n\nThe oak processionary (\"Thaumetopoea processionea\") is a moth whose caterpillars can be found in oak forests, where they feed on oak leaves, causing significant damage. They travel in nose-to-tail processions (hence their name), often arrow-headed, with a leader followed by rows of several caterpillars abreast. They are a human irritant because of their venomous setae (hairs), which can cause skin irritation and asthma. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\".\n\nThe moths are widely distributed in central and southern Europe, and are occasionally found as far north as Sweden. In the southern countries of Europe the populations are controlled by natural predators, but these predators are not present in northern Europe. Their range is expanding northward, possibly or partly as a result of global warming. The moth now has an established population in the UK. The eggs arrived on oak imported to the Richmond and Ealing areas of London in 2006 and the range of the species in the UK has been steadily expanding despite efforts to eradicate it.\n\nThe wingspan of adult stage moths is between . Their pattern of tan, brown and white make the adults difficult to see against oak bark. Adults fly during July and August. The larvae construct communal nests of white silk from which they crawl at night in single file, head to tail in large processions to feed on foliage in the crowns of trees, returning in the same manner.\n\nOak is its preferred food source, but the moth also eats the leaves of hazel, hornbeam, sweet chestnut, birch and beech.\n\nThe caterpillars live and feed almost exclusively on oak trees. They may march in procession across the ground between oak trees, and cluster together as they feed on oak leaves. In early summer they build silk nests on the trunks and branches, but not in the leaves, of oak trees, and leave silk trails on the trunks and branches. The nests and trails are originally white and visible, but soon become discoloured and hard to see.\n\nThe nests may be hemispherical, teardrop shaped, bag-like, and blanket-like (surrounding part of a trunk or branch), and may be at any height on the tree. The diameter may range from about 25 mm (one inch) to stretching several meters up the trunk. The caterpillars stay in these nests during the day between feeding periods, and later in the summer they remain in the nests to pupate into adult moths.\n\nThe caterpillars are mostly found in oak trees or on the ground under them in late spring and early summer, and do not live on fences, walls, etc. as other caterpillars do. They have very long, white hairs contrasting markedly with shorter hairs. The caterpillars of several other species may be mistaken for the oak processionary.\n\nThe moths pose an increasing nuisance to humans as their range is extended. The backs of older caterpillars (3rd to 6th instars) are covered with up to 63,000 pointed defensive bristles, sized between 0.2 and 0.3 millimeters, which contain an urticating toxin, the protein thaumetopoein. The setae break off readily, become airborne and can cause epidemic caterpillar dermatitis (lepidopterism), manifested as a papular rash, pruritus, conjunctivitis and, if inhaled, pharyngitis and respiratory distress, including asthma or even anaphylaxis.\n\nIt has been found that the skin irritation and itching caused by contact with these hairs can be largely eliminated by the use of cetirizine-based antihistamine tablets.\n\nTransmission of the hairs can be airborne, by ground contact via plants or grass or even by water contact in stillwater e.g. garden ponds. The toxicity of the hairs remains active beyond the normal life cycle of the moth and in some cases can remain a problem for several seasons.\nMowing a lawn can bring a person into contact with these hairs. One alternative is to adopt a grass mulching technique to reduce possible contact, and to speed up the biological breakdown of the irritant hairs.\n\nLarge populations can strip trees bare, leaving them weakened and vulnerable to other threats.\n\nNests can be removed, or the caterpillars sprayed with pesticides soon after they hatch. However, neither approach is 100% effective. Male moths can be trapped in pheromone traps; this does not significantly reduce the population, but provides an indication of moth distribution.\n\nThe caterpillars were accidentally introduced to the UK in 2005, almost certainly as eggs on live oak plants imported from continental Europe. Later distribution of the pest probably arose from several similar introductions, in addition to spread from the original point of introduction. By 2019 they had spread to all 33 London boroughs, and the Government had spent £37 million trying to control them.\nThe general public have been asked to look out for these caterpillars and to report them, rather than deal with them themselves. The London Boroughs of Brent, Ealing, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames set up task forces to deal with outbreaks. Sightings of these caterpillars in other areas should be reported to the Forestry Commission, whose research agency issued guidance on the way to contain outbreaks and deal with infestations, so as not to increase the risk to the public.\n\nOn 31 March 2008 an emergency amendment added the moth to the list of pests in The Plant Health (Forestry) Order 2005, and has required all oak trees coming into the UK from the rest of Europe to have Plant Passports.\n\nIn 2013 the Forestry Commission announced helicopters would be deployed to \"blanket spray woodland\" where the caterpillars posed a health threat.\n\nIn 2015 fifteen OPM nests were found in Hampstead Heath, Highgate Wood and Queen's Park; in 2018 over 2,000 were found at those sites. In April 2018 an outbreak of the caterpillars was declared in Greater London and surrounding areas. In Spring 2019 more were reported at Bracknell by the BBC News website , and a number were also found in Virginia Water.\n\nOn 15 July 2019 strengthened measures on the import of most species of oak into England were introduced to protect native trees from the threat of the pest.\n\nThe moth is reported as being fairly common in Belgium, notably in the Campine but also elsewhere, the population fluctuating from year to year. In 2007 infestations in the province of Limburg were so acute that soldiers were deployed to burn them.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the caterpillars are dealt with by biological pest control. As in Germany, local authorities use fluids containing Bt toxins, a biological pesticide. These fluids are sprayed onto the infected trees. In cases of serious contamination, the use of relatively mild chemical pest killers has been allowed by local authorities. \n\nAn experiment with bird houses for the great tit began in 2016. It has been observed that great tits like to eat the young, not yet hairy caterpillars in April. \n\nBecause chemicals may be harmful to other insects, an alternative is to use vacuuming equipment to remove the caterpillars and then incinerating them.\n\n\n"}

He was also a U.S. Army associate, business partner, and close friend of President Harry S. Truman.\n\nJacobson was born in New York's Lower East Side. His parents, David (1851–1935) and Sarah Rubin Jacobson (1862–1941) were impoverished Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. Jacobson had three brothers and two sisters. The family moved to Kansas in 1893, settling in Leavenworth, before finally relocating to Kansas City, Missouri in 1905.\n\nJacobson met Truman in 1905, when both worked in downtown Kansas City, MO. They renewed their acquaintance in 1917 when they reported for basic training at Fort Sill, near Lawton, Oklahoma, with a unit of soldiers from the Kansas City area. They successfully managed a canteen together, and were thus inspired to open a haberdashery together after World War I. The business failed as a result of the post-war recession and the resulting debts burdened both for many years. Jacobson spent the rest of his career as a traveling salesman, which enabled him periodically to visit Truman in Washington. According to David McCullough, Jacobson had open access to the Oval Office.\n\nWhen Jacobson first heard about what was happening to the Jews in Germany before and during World War II, he took to discussing it with Truman. After he heard the post-war reports regarding the Holocaust and its survivors, his talks with Truman about how to help the Jewish people became more intense. Because Jewish leaders in the U.S. knew Jacobson was a friend of the President, they approached him to lobby Truman with even more fervor.\n\nOn March 13, 1948, Jacobson went to the White House, and at that meeting persuaded Truman to meet with the leader of the Zionist movement, Dr. Chaim Weizmann. Truman had been increasingly irritated by lobbying from Zionists, and had issued instructions that he did not want to see any more Zionist spokesmen, but Jacobson reminded him about his admiration for Andrew Jackson, and said \"Your hero is Andrew Jackson. I have a hero too. He's the greatest Jew alive. I'm talking about Chaim Weizmann. He's an old man and very sick, and he has traveled thousands of miles to see you. And now you're putting him off. This isn't like you, Harry\". Truman then decided to meet with Weizmann. Partly as a result of Jacobson's efforts, the United States became the first nation to grant diplomatic recognition to the new state of Israel on May 14, 1948.\n\nIn 1949, Jacobson visited Israel, where he met with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and President Chaim Weizmann. One Kansas City rabbi told reporters that Jacobson should become President of Israel, and Truman wrote him that while Israel \"couldn't nominate a better man, I sincerely hope you won't take it\". Jacobson rejected the suggestion, saying that it was just \"a silly dream of a very emotional rabbi\", and that he was \"too proud of my American citizenship to trade it for any office in the world\".\n\nAfter Truman's retirement in 1953, Jacobson had wanted to be his escort for his first visit to Israel. However, before he had the chance, he died of a heart attack in 1955.\n\n\n"}

The lake was created by a hydroelectric dam (about downstream on the Red Cedar at Cedar Falls. The lake, a popular resort and fishing spot, has a surface area of approximately .\n\nBefore the installation of the dam at Cedar Falls (Kakabika Falls), Tainter Lake did not exist. The decision to build the mill and dam came from Andrew Tainter (1823 - 1899), a wealthy lumber baron who was a partner in Knapp, Stout and Company, the largest lumber mill in the country during the 1870s. It was reported that they owned of pine land and employed 1,200 men. By that time the company had logging camps on nearly every stream leading to the Red Cedar and controlled almost all of the Red Cedar River and its tributaries. The company's largest mill operation was on the Menomonee River (what the Red Cedar was commonly called) where the lumber settlement became known as the \"mills of Menomonie\" or \"Menomonie Mills\" and finally Menomonie, now the county seat of Dunn. The firm continued to log until 1899 when the forests were exhausted and competition keen. The mill at Cedar Falls closed in 1901.\n\nDuring those productive years of logging, acres of forest land near and next to the Red Cedar River were cleared. While the company owned a number of farms to provide food and meat for the loggers, pioneer farmers also moved to the area, removed stumps and began farming. Most of the newly created farm land sloped, or had access, to the river as it had been so efficient for logging. Decades later this same watershed, and the farming industry, would mean trouble for Tainter Lake. Vegetation maps of the mid-1880s show that the area was 90% forest and 10% native grasses. Maps of the early 1980s indicate that the basin area is less than 50% forest and 40% agricultural land. These are the historical issues that affect the area today, contributing to the excessive algae in Lake Tainter. \nTainter Lake is located in the Town of Tainter in northern Dunn County, Wisconsin. A small channel divides the lake into North and South regions. the channel creates some of the narrowest parts of the lake (50 ft) and also contains the deepest part of the lake (35 ft). The average depth of the lake is .\n\nA few very small resorts are situated on the shores, although the lake is not known for its large fish populations. North Tainter is better known for its fishing than the southern part. This is because the north has multiple fish cribs that were planted over the last 20 years, is significantly shallower than the southern part of the lake, and has many species of fish that spawn in the shallow slow moving water.\n\nNorth Tainter Lake is fed primarily by the Red Cedar River, but also by the Hay River. Both rivers drain the farm fields north of Lake Tainter. The TMLIA (Tainter Menomin Lake Improvement Association) has been diligently working on an algae problem for the last several years. With their increased participation; hopefully the lake will continue to see some improvement. The Red Cedar River south of the Cedar Falls dam creates flows for about three miles (5 km) until it reaches Lake Menomin, which was also created by a dam on the Red Cedar. Because the Lake Menomin dam is the last one on the Red Cedar River before the Mississippi, it is legal to fish that part of the river out of season.\n\nCommon species of fish in Tainter Lake include walleye, black crappie, and bluegill. Somewhat common species include yellow perch, northern pike, common carp, white bass, and bowfin. Water quality is an issue for fishing in the summer months as large algae blooms decrease water visibility making it hard for fish to see bait fish. Walleye are heavily pressured by fishermen year round and have an average length of less than 15 inches. Walleye from 20 inches to 24 inches cannot be kept.\n\nXcel Energy operates the Cedar Falls Hydroelectric Project, which impounds Tainter Lake. The project consists of a long high dam located near Cedar Falls, Wisconsin. Its powerhouse contains three 2,000 kW electrical generators with a total capacity of 7.1 MW. The facility can produce over 33.6 million kilowatt hours of electricity each year. It is a modified run-of-the-river hydroelectricity project. The Cedar Falls dam was originally a timber dam and was replaced with a concrete dam in 1910. New generators were added in 1912 and 1915 and the project has changed little since that time. In 2005 the dam's gates were upgraded to include Obermeyer spillway gates with inflatable rubber bladders that allow more consistent water levels on the lake through the year. Before the installation of the inflatable gates, the dam featured gates made of plywood that were designed to break as the ice melted. During the installation of the inflatable gates the water level of the lake dropped about 5 or . This caused the water to erode some of the land that people put their docks on. When the water level returned to normal residents living on the lake with docks had to shorten the length of their dock because the water had become significantly deeper.\n\n\n"}
