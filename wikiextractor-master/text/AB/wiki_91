It is now an international event; in 2005, over two million students in the U.S. participated, as well as students in Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Ghana, Guam, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Malaysia, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Scotland, Singapore and South Africa.\n\nIn the U.S., school-sponsored prayers in public schools have been found unconstitutional, but prayers organized by students themselves are allowed and protected by free speech rights.\nThe organization advocating and guiding student participation in SYATP events insists that they be exclusively student-initiated and led without official endorsement or interference, according to rights affirmed by the \"Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\" decision of the U.S. Supreme Court—as well as a 1995 Clinton administration assignment of the President's Secretary of Education for legalization of particular school religious activities as long as they passed constitutional guidelines. The American Civil Liberties Union also approves of student-led SYATP events held before or after school, provided the school neither encourages nor discourages participation.\n\nPastors, teachers, and other adults are often involved, and critics say that SYATP events often are only nominally student-led.\n\nIn 2006, school officials at South Floyd High School in Floyd County, Kentucky tried to deny students permission for the flag pole rally, but attorneys from the Rutherford Institute successfully argued that the rally was protected by free speech rights. \"It's important that students, teachers and others know about their right to participate in See You at the Pole events—a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court,\" said John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, in a released statement. \"The rallies are part of a long tradition of free and equal participation in expressive activities guaranteed by our Constitution.\"\n\nIn the case of \"Doe v. Wilson County School System\" (M.D. Tenn. 2006, pending), the ACLU alleged that a parent group promoted the SYATP event and a National Day of Prayer with support from the school. Support for SYATP was one of several religious endorsements alleged in the case, along with sing-along prayers, hymns, and a Nativity play.\n\nAfter SYATP rallies are events which usually take place the evening of SYATP. These rallies are sponsored by local churches or local youth ministry networks and generally include one or more of the following elements: Contemporary Christian Music concert, worship, testimonies, drama, and/or a speaker.\n\n"}

Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope.\n\nFossilised specimens of \"Isoetes beestonii\" have been found in rocks dating to the latest Permian. Quillworts are considered by some to be the last remnant of the fossil tree \"Lepidodendron\" with which they share some unusual features including the development of both wood and bark, a modified shoot system acting as roots, bipolar growth, and an upright stance.\n\nAll quillworts and their extinct relatives are heterosporous. Some fossil species are very well known, with many stages of development and the life cycle preserved. Two of the best known are the Carboniferous \"Chaloneria\" and Cretaceous \"Nathorstiana\".\n\n"}

After an apprenticeship as an enamel painter at a Pforzheim factory he attended the School of Arts and Crafts in Stuttgart. He subsequently studied under Hans Thoma and Wilhelm Trübner at the Academy in Karlsruhe. Called for military service in World War I, he carried out a hunger strike to secure early release, and in 1919 he moved to Berlin where he joined the Communist Party of Germany and the \"November\" group. He took part in a Dada fair in 1920 and also worked as an illustrator for several periodicals. \n\nA major work from this period is his \"Dada Roof Studio\", a watercolor showing an assortment of figures on an urban rooftop. Around a table sit a woman and two men in top hats. One of the men has a prosthetic hand and the other, also missing a hand, appears on closer scrutiny to be mannequin. Two other figures in gas masks may also be mannequins. A child holds a pail and a woman wearing high button shoes (for which Schlichter displayed a marked fetish) stands on a pedestal, gesturing inexplicably.\n\nIn 1925 Schlichter participated in the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" exhibit at the Mannheim Kunsthalle. His work from this period is realistic, a good example being the \"Portrait of Margot\" (1924) now in the Berlin Märkisches Museum. It depicts a prostitute who often modeled for Schlichter, standing on a deserted street and holding a cigarette. \n\nWhen Adolf Hitler took power, bringing to an end the Weimar period, his activities were greatly curtailed. In 1935 he returned to Stuttgart, and four years later to Munich. In 1937 his works were seized as degenerate art, and in 1939 the Nazi authorities banned him from exhibiting. His studio was destroyed by Allied bombs in 1942.\n\nAt the war's end, Schlichter resumed exhibiting works. His works from this period were surrealistic in character. He died in Munich in 1955.\n\n"}

His twin brother is the historian Roy Medvedev.\n\nZhores Medvedev and his twin brother Roy were born on 14 November 1925 in Tbilisi, Transcaucasian SFSR, USSR. Their mother Yulia (\"nee\" Reiman), was a cellist, and their father, Alexander Medvedev, was a philosopher in a military academy in Leningrad. Zhores, named after French socialist leader Jean Jaurès (his twin was named after Indian revolutionary M. N. Roy), was drafted into the Red Army in 1943, but was soon discharged after being seriously wounded in a battle on the Taman Peninsula. He then began his studies in biology at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in Moscow. In December 1950, Zhores was awarded a PhD degree for his research into sexual processes in plants.\n\nHe became a junior research scientist in the Agrochemistry and Biochemistry Department at Timiryazev Academy and he was promoted to senior research scientist in 1954 and remained at the academy until 1963. Beginning in 1952, Medvedev had focused his attention on the problems of aging, concentrating on the turnover of proteins and nucleic acids. In 1961, he published the first paper suggesting that aging is the result of an accumulation of errors in the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. In 1962, Medvedev wrote his book on the history of Soviet genetics, which passed an editorial review but was withheld by state censors. It was later published in the United States in 1969 as \"The Rise and Fall of T.D. Lysenko\".\n\nIn 1963, Medvedev moved to Obninsk to the Institute of Medical Radiology, where he was appointed head of the molecular radiobiology laboratory. He published two books, \"Protein Biosynthesis and Problems of Heredity Development and Ageing\" and \"Molecular Mechanisms of Development\".\n\nMedvedev was dismissed from his position in 1969. Between 1968 and 1970, Medvedev wrote two more books: \"International Cooperation of Scientists and National Frontiers\" and \"Secrecy of Correspondence is Guaranteed by Law\" (about postal censorship in the USSR). These works were widely circulated in the USSR among scientists, along with a copy of his 1962 history of Soviet genetics (which had been published in \"Grani,\" a Russian journal published outside the USSR), and this activity resulted in Medvedev's arrest and forced detention in the Kaluga psychiatric hospital in May 1970. This action, however, produced many protests from scientists (academics Andrei Sakharov, Pyotr Kapitsa, Igor Tamm, Vladimir Engelgardt, Boris Astaurov, Nikolai Semyonov, and others) and writers (including Solzhenitsyn, Tvardovsky, Vladimir Tendryakov, Vladimir Dudintsev), which resulted in Medvedev's release (this experience was reflected in Zhores and Roy Medvedev's book \"A Question of Madness\").\n\nIn 1971, Medvedev was given the job of Senior scientist of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of Farm Animals in Borovsk, in the Kaluga region.\n\nIn 1972, Medvedev was invited for one year's research by the National Institute for Medical Research in London at its new Genetic Division. In August 1973, however, his Soviet passport was confiscated and he was stripped of his Soviet citizenship. He remained in London and worked as Senior Research Scientist at the National Institute for Medical Research until his retirement in 1991.\n\nIn 1977, Medvedev published \"Hazards of Nuclear Power\", which mentioned the Kyshtym nuclear disaster in passing. At the time, the disaster was essentially unknown, and his work was dismissed as baseless propaganda even by his Western colleagues. Medvedev responded by publishing \"Soviet Science\" in 1978, which assembled evidence from Soviet publications that taken together comprised conclusive evidence of the disaster's occurrence. He followed this with the book \"The Nuclear Disaster in the Urals\" in 1979, and a further critique \"The Legacy of Chernobyl\" (1990), which connected the two disasters as being a product of the same attitudes toward science and engineering in the USSR.\n\nIn London, Medvedev acted as his brother Roy's representative, managing his publishing contracts and financial affairs. In 1975 he created a small publishing house, \"T.C.D. publications\", for the purpose of publishing the Russian-language version of Roy Medvedev's samizdat journal \"XX Century\". The two brothers also coauthored \"Khrushchev: The Years in Power\" (1978) and several other books, the last one \"The Unknown Stalin\" (2007).\n\nMedvedev died in London on 15 November 2018, one day after his 93rd birthday, with his family by his side. \nIn 2019, his memoirs posthumously appeared in Russian under the title \"A Dangerous Profession.\"\n\nMedvedev published about 170 research papers and reviews, about sixty of them during his time in London. In 1973 he was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto. He received the Aging Research Award from the United States Association of Biogerontology in 1984 and the Rene Schubert Prize in Gerontology in 1985.\n\nAccording to Michael Gordin, a professor of History at Princeton University, Medvedev provided critiques of the Soviet Union that were \"powerful, persuasive and principled\", with Medvedev being \"sympathetic to the dreams of the [Russian] Revolution,\" but opposed to the \"cronyism and Stalinism [that] had contaminated the early promise.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The descriptor term for crater chains is catena, plural catenae (Latin for \"chain\"), as specified by the International Astronomical Union's rules on planetary nomenclature.\n\nMany examples of such chains are thought to have been formed by the impact of a body that was broken up by tidal forces into a string of smaller objects following roughly the same orbit. An example of such a tidally disrupted body that was observed prior to its impact on Jupiter is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. During the Voyager observations of the Jupiter system, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede (except those formed by secondary craters). Later some of these chains turned out to be secondary or tectonic features, but some other chains were discovered. As of 1996, 8 primary chains on Callisto and 3 on Ganymede were confirmed.\n\nOther cases, such as many of those on Mars, represent chains of collapse pits associated with grabens (see, for example, the Tithoniae Catenae near Tithonium Chasma).\n\nCrater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from larger craters, and in such cases are thought to be either caused by secondary impacts of the larger crater's ejecta or by volcanic venting activity along a rift.\n\n\n"}

Jesus has just rebuffed \"the tempter's\" first temptation; in this verse, the devil presents Jesus with a second temptation while they are standing on the pinnacle of the temple in the \"holy city\" (Jerusalem).\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:6\n\nAs with , Satan is not doubting that Jesus is the Son of God but rather is stating that he should do these things because he is the Son of God. Satan here is trying to convince Jesus to throw himself from the pinnacle of the temple because God has promised that he will not be hurt. To advance this temptation the devil quotes scripture, something Swiss theologian Eduard Schweizer sees as an escalation over the first temptation.\n\nThe verse quoted is taken from the eleventh and twelfth verses of Psalm 91. In the KJV, those verses read:\n\nThe quotation omits the line \"to guard you in all your ways\". Robert Gundry notes that the original wording makes it clear that God is promising only to protect from accidents, not from deliberate acts such as the one Satan is proposing.\n\nThe exact evil Satan is trying to induce in this verse is open to debate. The traditional view was that the temptation narrative was one of rejecting sin and this test was simply Satan luring Jesus with the sin of hubris. Most modern scholars reject this view of the temptation. A view that was popular for a time was that the three temptation sequences each represent Jesus rejecting one vision of what the Messiah should be. In this verse Satan tries to convince him that he should be a magician and miracle worker who wins converts by his spectacular acts. Gundry notes that the choice of the Temple as a setting is evidence for this theory. There are many precipices in the wilderness, that Satan brings him to the top of the temple implies that the miraculous rescue would be a very public act. A view that is in vogue today is that Satan is placing before Jesus the same pitfalls that the Jewish people fell into during the period after Exodus. In the desert the Israelites attempted to test God and Satan is proposing that Jesus do the same. This interpretation fits most closely with Jesus' response to this temptation in the next verse.\n"}

Emelec\n\nClub Sport Emelec is an Ecuadorian sports club based in Guayaquil that is best known for their professional football team. The football team plays in the Ecuadorian Serie A, the highest level of professional football in the country.\n\nEmelec has won fourteen Serie A titles, holding the record of doing so in all decades in which the Serie A has been played. They also have won seven regional titles (record in their region), a record-tying 5 of them in the professional era.\n\nEmelec was founded on April 28, 1929 by George Capwell, the American head of the Electric Company of Ecuador (), from which the club is named after. The name of their home stadium pays homage to the club's founder. The club's most intense rivalry is with crosstown-team Barcelona. Matches between the clubs are known as \"El Clásico del Astillero\".\n\nThe club was found after an assembly of employees at the Empresa Eléctrica del Ecuador, an electric company in Guayaquil, decided to start an amateur sports league. The initiative was spearheaded by George Capwell, the executive officer of the company who came from the United States. The first sports played in the club were baseball, basketball, boxing, swimming, handball, and football. Capwell did not enjoy football, so the sport was supported only by his employees in non-official but recognized championships. This changed in the 1940s, when Capwell finally lent his support, resulting in the club winning several official local championships, building their own stadium, and hosting the 1947 South American Championship entirely in it.\n\nIn 1957, the club became the first national champions in football with a \"dream team\" that included Derek Haack, Cipriano Yu Lee, José Vicente Balseca, Cruz Ávila, Mariano Larraz, Carlos Alberto Raffo, Jaime Ubilla, Daniel Pinto, Rómulo Gómez and Suárez-Rizzo; they were coached by Eduardo \"Tano\" Spandre. Since then, they have accumulated thirteen more national titles, placing them 2nd in the national title count behind Barcelona with 15 titles and followed by El Nacional with 13. They have also won seven local titles (two in the amateur area and five in the professional era).\n\nIn the 1990s, the football team saw success internationally. In 1995, they reached the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores; they lost to eventual champions Grêmio. In 2001, the team was close to becoming the first Ecuadorian club to win an international title when they were a finalist in the 2001 Copa Merconorte. In the finals, they lost to Millionarios 3–1 on penalty kicks after tying on aggregate 2–2.\n\nSeveral years after the creation of the Empresa Eléctrica del Ecuador sports club, its founder, George Lewis Capwell, decided that it was time for the club to have its own Baseball stadium, so in 1942 Guayaquil's Municipal authorities donated 4 city blocks for the construction of the first private sports stadium in Ecuador. A year after that, in 1943, Emelec's staff officially named and initiated the construction of the George Capwell Stadium.\n\nGeorge Capwell Stadium opened its doors for the first time on October 21 of 1945, the inaugural game was a Baseball match between Emelec and Oriente, and George Capwell played as a catcher for the \"Azules\" (Emelec). Although Emelec's president did not like football and their stadium was not initially intended to be a football field, soon after the inauguration the first football match was held. Emelec won 5–4 against an all stars team from the cities of Manta and Bahia.\n\nThe 1947 Copa America competition was held exclusively at George Capwell Stadium, and an undefeated Argentina became South America's champion with an all star team that included names like Alfredo Di Stéfano, Félix Loustau, and Norberto Doroteo Méndez. Ecuador finished in 6th place. (Brazil did not participate on this competition).\n\nAfter the Estadio Modelo was opened in 1959, the George Capwell Stadium became obsolete and was closed for many years. On several occasions it was almost destroyed for various projects that, luckily for the club, were never actually completed.\n\nIt wasn't until 1991 that with the leadership of Nassib Nehme that the George Capwell Stadium was reopened, to become once again the house of Emelec. Since its reopening the stadium has been enlarged twice and a new and final change was scheduled for 2014, to reach a final capacity of 45,000 spectators by March 2016.\n\nAt the moment the official capacity of the stadium according to the FEF (Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol) is 18,000 spectators. However, that number has not been changed even after the two enlargements were finished. The club completed a thorough overhaul and expansion of the stadium in 2017. It is now a state of the art world class stadium fully FIFA compliant with a capacity of 40,000 spectators.\n\nEmelec's training ground is located in the north of Guayaquil in a neighborhood called Los Samanes and the training ground itself is called Complejo Deportivo de Los Samanes, translated to Los Samanes Sports Complex. The construction of the Samanes training ground started in 1984 and was finished in 1986 and was built by Filanbanco a large financial institution in Ecuador at the time.\n\nFilanbanco had its own professional football which used Los Samanes until 1989 when despite being one of the top teams at the time, Filanbanco's football club was disbanded due to lack of supporters and high maintenance costs.\n\nDuring the 1993 Copa America held in Ecuador, the Samanes complex was used by the Argentinean delegation, they stayed and trained there and were very appreciative of its secluded nature and excellent facilities, that among other things included 4 professional football fields, an indoor football field, basketball courts, tennis courts, an Olympic size pool, social area and sleeping area.Club Social Cultural y Deportivo Don Café \n\nAfter Filanbanco's football club was disbanded, the complex remained in the hands of Filanbanco for their employees to use its facilities, until 1999 when the Ecuadorian financial crisis ended with Filanbanco going bankrupt and ending up in the hands of the AGD a governmental agency created to control, protect and administrate the assets of Filanbanco and other financial institutions that went bust during the crisis.\n\nThis meant that Los Samanes ended up in the hands of the Issfa (Instituto de Servicio Social de las Fuerzas Armadas) the Ecuadorian army's social security agency. Because Issfa had no real use for it, the then Football director of Emelec Mr. Omar Quintana Baquerizo managed to loan the training ground for the club and Emelec has been using it ever since.\n\nInitially the agreement was a loan for 5 years, but when the 5 years passed the government and the club arranged a 100-year loan for the facilities, however the high monthly cost agreed has made the payments very difficult for the club and the new administrators led by the club's president Mr. Elias Wated are in talks with the government to settle on a definitive purchase of the training ground.\n\nEcuadorian Serie A\n\nEcuadorian Serie B\n\nCampeonato Unión Deportiva Comercial de Guayaquil\n\nCampeonato Amateur del Fútbol del Guayas\n\nCampeonato Profesional de Guayaquil\n\n\nEmelec has had nine players become the season top-scorer in the Serie A, three players become the top-scorer of the Costa champion (two players repeated), and one player become the top-scorer of the Copa Libertadores.\n\n\n\n\nThe following managers won at least one trophy when in charge of Emelec:\n\nEmelec is not only one of the most important football clubs in Ecuador, but it is rated as one of the most important sports club of the country.

It starred Edward Woodward as David Callan, an agent of a state secret service dealing with internal security threats to the United Kingdom. Though portrayed as having responsibilities similar to those of the real-life MI5, Callan's fictional \"Section\" has \"carte blanche\" to use the most ruthless of methods. In the storylines interrogation is by means of torture, while extrajudicial killings are so routine they have a colour-coded filing system. With the possible exception of \"La Femme Nikita\", no TV series has ever presented a Western government agency in so sinister a light as \"Callan\". Despite being an assassin who stays in the socially isolating job because it is the only thing he is good at, Callan is a sympathetic character by comparison to his sadistic upper-class colleagues and implacable superior. The downbeat cover for the Section's headquarters was the scrap metal business of \"Charlie Hunter\" (a possible reference to the Richardson Gang). Produced by ABC Weekend Television and Thames Television, the programme proved extremely popular; as well as four series between 1967 and 1972, followed by a feature length film in 1974 and a TV movie in 1981.\n\n\nThe series pilot episode aired in February 1967, in an \"Armchair Theatre\" play entitled \"A Magnum for Schneider\" by James Mitchell. Mitchell was later responsible for creating \"When the Boat Comes In\" (1976–81) for the BBC. The haunted character of Callan caught the public's imagination to such an extent that a six-episode series was commissioned and broadcast, later in the same year. A further series of 16 followed, though with both ABC and Associated Rediffusion (broadcasters in the London region) going through the process of merging, by the time the second series was broadcast in 1969 it was attributed to Thames Television (the result of the merger).\n\nOverall, the series was successful in the television ratings, running between 1967 and 1972. The closing episode of the 1969 series saw a severely under-pressure Callan get shot, with a clever publicity campaign following to ensure that viewers cared whether the character lived (he did) or died. The last two series were in colour and proved as popular as ever. A cinema film simply entitled \"Callan\" followed in 1974, directed by Don Sharp. Callan was last seen in the 1981 feature-length television story made by ATV, entitled \"Wet Job\". Though less satisfactory than the preceding series, it was a chance for viewers to see the main characters of Callan and Lonely one more time.\n\nThe Section used a series of colour-coded files to indicate targets of different priorities (with much relevance for the title of the novel \"Red File for Callan\");\n\nThe original TV play was screened in 1967, followed by a first series of six episodes, a second series of fifteen episodes, a third series of nine episodes and a fourth series of thirteen episodes (in all, 22 black-and-white and 22 colour episodes).\n\nCallan has been retired from an anonymous government agency known as \"The Section\", run by Colonel Hunter (the name \"Hunter\" is used as a code name for the current Section Chief, similar to the C of SIS). The Section removes those who pose a danger to the public, using either persuasion, blackmail, extortion or death. David Callan had been the Section's top operative, but had become too curious about his targets and the rationale for their removal. The Section considered him vulnerable, volatile and dangerous, so had laid him off to a dead-end book-keeping job with an ungrateful employer.\n\nThe pilot was novelised by its scriptwriter, James Mitchell, who went on to write most of the TV series episodes. The book was published under the title \"Red File For Callan\" in the US, and as \"A Magnum for Schneider\" in the UK, the storyline being based around Callan's love for toy soldier war games, an interest shared by his target, Schneider, a Hampstead-based arms dealer.\n\nThe pilot, filmed in black-and-white, was later remade in colour as a feature film in 1974, two years after the television series ended.\n\nABC commissioned a first series of six episodes in 1967. In the first episode Callan rejoins the section in an unofficial capacity. The series was characterised by Callan's stand-off, barely-respectful, relationship with his boss, Hunter, who schemed to retain Callan on his side, and would play him off in little divide-and-rule scenarios with or against his fellow agents, in an effort to maintain his control. It was not always apparent that these ploys worked. Callan's underworld contact, Lonely (Russell Hunter), developed into an unofficial sidekick, whose shadowing qualities outshone his sense of personal hygiene, something Meres in particular took joy in pointing out. Lonely remained ignorant of Callan's real work and believed him to be something of a gangland villain.\n\nBy 1969, ABC Weekend Television had, due to an enforced merger with Rediffusion, become Thames Television. A second series of fifteen episodes, which had already been completed by ABC, was therefore transmitted under the name of the new company. This run ended with \"Death of a Hunter\", in which the Section chief meets his demise, and Callan is shot – perhaps fatally. It had not been decided whether the show would return for a third series, so this device was used to leave open either the possibility of more stories in the future, or a way of winding-up the show. Two endings were taped, in which Callan either lived or died. In the end, Thames decided to bring the programme back in 1970, this time in colour, for a series consisting of a further nine episodes.\n\nThe third series, the first in colour, saw Callan still recovering from having been shot and struggling to come to terms with his situation. Interviews with Snell (the Section's doctor) and poor shooting range results portrayed Callan as a barely-functioning human being, whose future with the Section looks to be in serious doubt. If Callan is to be of any use to Hunter, something has to spark him into life. In league with Meres' younger, brasher, edgier and unpredictable replacement, James Cross (played by Patrick Mower), the new Hunter concocts a scenario whereby Callan's energies are incited into real emotions that can be turned against the enemy. The remaining eight episodes see the revitalised yet ever-more world-weary assassin cover more ground, including one episode where love comes unexpectedly into his life, and which has the (expected) unexpected ending.\n\nThe final set of thirteen episodes was broadcast in 1972. This saw Callan develop further than before. An unsuccessful mission results in Callan being interrogated in a Russian prison, but he is exchanged by the Soviets for one of their agents. Now he is known to them, he has become a liability. What to do with the Section's top agent is solved by promoting him to the position of Hunter – a post he dislikes as much or even more than actually serving under a Hunter. However, this move by his masters has motives, and he is eventually relieved of his duties after an incident in which he re-enters the fray as an agent, which was against the rules. He is replaced as Hunter by his predecessor. The final three episodes form a trilogy based around the defecting Soviet agent Richmond (played by T. P. McKenna), which was sub-titled \"The Richmond Files\".\n\nThe 1981 feature-length television story \"Wet Job\", written by Mitchell and produced by ATV (without the original theme music or logo), rounded off the saga with a positive ending to the story of Callan and Lonely. Callan has become the proprietor of a military memorabilia shop when he is recruited by the new Hunter for one more job. Alas, he has to do this alone: Lonely has become a dapper gent, engaged to be married, and with enough self-confidence to defy Callan's request for help. In the end, Callan completes the task, survives, and even ends up with a girlfriend.\n\nA Callan documentary entitled \"This Man Alone\" was released on DVD in November 2015. Narrated by Edward Woodward's son Peter Woodward, it includes contributions from Peter Mitchell, Reginald Collin, Mike Vardy, and James Goddard. Additionally the DVD includes a new transfer of \"A Magnum for Schneider\" and \"The Good Ones Are All Dead\", a music-themed TV special \"The Edward Woodward Hour\", and a documentary on James Mitchell, \"A World of My Own\".\n\nThe cinema film was an expanded re-working of James Mitchell's original 1967 TV pilot episode, \"A Magnum for Schneider\". Taking much of its new material from Mitchell's own novelisation of that teleplay, it was based more on the novel than on the original television script. For legal reasons, no mention is made of the pilot teleplay or the TV series. The film's credits mention only the novel as its source, identifying it by the title – \"Red File for Callan\" – under which it had been published by Simon & Schuster in the United States in 1969, so as to avoid any reference to the title of the ABC television pilot.\n\nIn 1974 Dell reissued the novel in paperback, as \"Red File for Callan\". But despite coinciding with the film's release this edition gave no hint of being a tie-in.\n\nIn the film, Callan's boss Hunter is played by Eric Porter, and Meres too is re-cast, this time played by Peter Egan (known at the time as a trendy gangster, from the controversial TV series \"Big Breadwinner Hog\", but now better known for sitcoms such as the BBC's \"Ever Decreasing Circles\"). The only recurring actors from the TV series were Edward Woodward as Callan, Russell Hunter as Lonely, and Clifford Rose as Dr Snell (who appears in five of the television episodes from series two, three and four – although in the film, reflecting the screenplay's 1967 origin, it's stated that Callan has never met Snell before).\n\n\nThere are two short story collections\n\nOn 7 December 2017, Big Finish Productions announced plans to release two box sets of Callan audio adventures based on the Sunday Express Short Stories written by James Mitchell. The tales have been adapted by Peter Mitchell, the series creator's son, and star Ben Miles in the title role, with Frank Skinner as \"Lonely\", Nicholas Briggs as \"Hunter\" and Jane Slavin as \"Liz\".\n\nVolume One released July 2018 Volume Two was expected to follow, however it has been delayed with no release date announced as of February 2020.\n\nThe following is a table listing the awards and nominations received by \"Callan\"\n\nThe series' theme tune, \"Girl in the Dark\" (also known as \"This Man Alone\"), was a library piece credited to Dutch composer Jan Stoeckart (under the penname \"Jack Trombey\", one of several aliases he used), issued by De Wolfe Music.\n\nHowever, an edition of \"Billboard\" newspaper dated 15 November 1975 reported on the conclusion of a seven-year copyright case brought in 1968 by Mood Music (a subsidiary of the Sparta-Florida Music Group), who claimed that \"Girl in the Dark\" was \"sufficiently similar\" to an Italian song, \"Sogno Nostalgico\", as to be an infringement of copyright. That song was claimed to have been composed in 1963, with records of it released in Italy in 1964 which were made available from Mood Music's library in 1965. But Mood proved oddly reluctant to push the case to a trial.\n\nThe accuracy of their claim may be judged from the fact that Mood also claimed, incorrectly, that \"Sogno Nostalgico\" was used as the theme for the British television series \"The Rat Catchers\", a piece of music which has always been credited to UK composer Johnny Pearson.\n\nDe Wolfe maintained that \"Girl in the Dark\", the work of Dutch composer Jan Stoeckart in 1960, had been submitted to other people before the copyright was assigned to them in 1966 (i.e. including a period before \"Sogno Nostalgico\" had been composed). A settlement was reached in 1975 once it became clear – from the 1974 feature film – that \"Callan\" was no longer using the piece, so that royalties had dried up. Copyright in it was vested by agreement in Mood Music in 1975, together with future royalties (but \"Callan\" never used it again), with De Wolfe retaining the majority of the royalties earned up to that point.\n\nDue to the ongoing legal action, the 1974 feature film conspicuously did not use the composition \"Girl in the Dark\", and the terms of the settlement of the case in 1975 led to its also not being used in ATV's 1981 reunion TV movie.\n\nIncidental music was not a feature of the \"Callan\" television series, except in \"A Magnum for Schneider\" where \"Girl in the Dark\" was repeatedly played in scenes in which Callan set to work.\n\nThe \"Armchair Theatre\" play from 1967 exists as a 16mm film recording of the original 405-line black-and-white television broadcast.\n\nThe 21 episodes of series 1 and 2 were recorded on black-and-white videotape, with filmed inserts; but several of these episodes have been lost or wiped. The surviving episodes from Series 1 still exist as 405-line tapes, and those episodes featured on the 2015 DVD \"A Man Alone\" had proper electronic conversions to 625-line video, but the episodes have previously had poor quality optical conversions by merely pointing a 625-line electronic camera at a monitor displaying the original 405-line recording. The surviving Series 2 episodes also exist on 405-line videotapes, but for DVD these were electronically (as opposed to optically) converted. In the case of \"The Worst Soldier I Ever Saw\", Network's DVD cover blurb states that the episode only survives as an unedited studio block, which had to be edited into its proper sequence for the DVD release.\n\nAll of the colour episodes exist, and the 1970 series was released on DVD in the UK in 2001. The episodes were edited to remove captions which would have led into the commercial breaks in the original transmission. This resulted in some awkward visual and audio jump cuts. The subsequent British DVD releases all retain the commercial break captions. The 1974 feature film was released on DVD separately.\n\nBoth the 1970 and 1972 series have had Region 4 DVD releases by Umbrella Entertainment. The 1972 series DVD also includes the feature film.\n\nThe separate DVD release of the 1974 feature film includes an interview, recorded in 2000, with Edward Woodward.\n\nAcorn Media released \"Callan - Set 1\" on 7 July 2009 which includes all 9 episodes from series 3. On 26 January 2010, \"Callan - Set 2\" was released featuring all 13 episodes from series 4. It has not been decided whether further series will be released to DVD in Region 1.\n\nClear Vision Video released three DVDs subtitled \"Series 1 Parts 1 – 3 of 3\", also available in a box titled \"Callan – The Complete Series One\", in 2001. In fact these DVDs comprise the nine episodes of Series 3 aired in 1970, the first colour series, although the back covers incorrectly claim that \"This edition comes from the first series that was ever shown on Thames Television\" (ABC had aired the complete first series before changing its name in the 1968 ITV franchise round; then, renamed Thames, it had shown the second series in 1969).\n\nPrism Leisure released the cinema film as \"Callan – The Movie\" on Region 0 PAL in 2001. The DVD also includes an interview with Edward Woodward.\n\nNetwork released \"Callan – The Monochrome Years\" in a DVD edition on 22 February 2010. This four DVD set includes the \"Armchair Theatre\" pilot play, 'A Magnum For Schnieder', plus the surviving 2 episodes of the first series (out of the original 6), and the surviving 9 episodes of the second series (out of the original 15). Network also released \"Callan – The Colour Years\" in 2010. \"Callan – Wet Job\" was then released by Network in 2011. Network were due to release the complete series, containing all the surviving episodes, \"The Definitive Collection\", the following year, but this did not happen; and eventually, in 2015, the special features announced for the set began to be released individually. This suggests the collection has been abandoned.\n\nUmbrella Entertainment released the third and fourth series on DVD in Australia in 2007.\n\n"}

Smith was brought up in the Wester Hailes area of the city, where he was encouraged by his stepfather, George Smith, an avid jazz fan and drummer in the Gene Krupa style, to take up the tenor saxophone at the age of twelve. When he was thirteen he attended a weekly jazz workshop under the direction of Gordon Cruikshank. He met pathologist and pianist Vincenzo Crucioli, who became a mentor. With drummer John Rae, his first group won Edinburgh International Jazz Festival Best Group award in 1981. At fourteen Smith won Best Soloist. He attributes much of his early success to the tuition of Vincenzo Crucioli. Under additional clarinettist Jim O'Malley and pianist Jean Allison at Wester Hailes Education Centre, Smith was soon performing around Edinburgh and Scotland with his quartet with John Rae. In 1983, at sixteen, he recorded his first album \"Giant Strides\" with a trio featuring Rae & Alan Taylor. During the same year, he recorded his second album \"Taking Off\", and won a scholarship, assisted by a fund-raising program organized by his music teacher, Jean Allison, to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston. At Berklee he formed the band Forward Motion with Norwegian bassist Terje Gewelt, Canadian drummer Ian Froman, and Hungarian pianist Laszlo Gardony. The band recorded two albums, \"Progressions\" and \"The Berklee Tapes\".\n\nWith a recommendation from Chick Corea, Smith joined Berklee vice-president Gary Burton's group with bassist Steve Swallow, pianist Makoto Ozone, and drummer Adam Nussbaum, touring the world and recording the album \"Whiz Kids\" for ECM.\n\nIn 1989, when he was twenty-two, Smith signed with Blue Note, which released his album \"Step by Step\". Burton produced the album with a band consisting of John Scofield (guitar), Eddie Gómez (bass), and Jack DeJohnette (drums). Three more albums followed for Blue Note: \"Peeping Tom\" (1990), \"Standards\" (1991), and \"Paris\" (1992). During this period Smith hosted a series of BBC-TV specials called \"Jazz Types\" in which he performed with guests such as Tommy Flanagan, Gary Burton, Chick Corea, Bobby Watson, Arild Andersen, Hue and Cry, and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Smith recorded and toured with Hue and Cry, a duo of brothers Pat and Greg Kane with American vibist Joe Locke, percussionist Trilok Gurtu, and Arild Andersen. Smith also examined classical composition, leading to his first saxophone concerto, \"Unirsi in Matrimonio\", and a suite for saxophone and strings, \"Un Ecossais a Paris\".\n\nIn 1993, Smith joined Scottish label Linn Records. His albums, \"Reminiscence\" (1993), \"Misty Morning and No Time\" (1994), \"Azure\" (1995, with Jon Christensen, Lars Danielsson and Kenny Wheeler), and \"Beasts of Scotland\" (1996) were released. Writing in \"Playboy\" magazine, Neil Tesser noted of \"Beasts of Scotland\" that \"Smith's artful writing makes the ensemble sound like a petite Philharmonic.\" \"The Sound of Love\" followed. Recorded in New York City in September 1997 with Kenny Barron (piano), Peter Washington (bass), and Billy Drummond (drums), it focused on the Duke Ellington-Billy Strayhorn songbook. \"Gymnopedie: The Classical Side of Tommy Smith\" (1998) was recorded with his regular duo partner, classical pianist Murray McLachlan. The disc included music by Satie, Bartok, Grieg, and Chick Corea, and Smith's Sonatas No. 1 \"Hall of Mirrors\" and No. 2 \"Dreaming With Open Eyes\" based on Michael Tucker's book of the same title. Returning to jazz and to New York the following year, Smith then recorded his final album for Linn, \"Blue Smith\", with John Scofield and his regular rhythm section of bassist James Genus and drummer Clarence Penn.\n\nIn 1995 Smith founded the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra, which has presented programs of repertory classics and more contemporary works, often specially commissioned.\n\nThe repertory programs have included Duke Ellington's extended suites, celebrations of Count Basie and Benny Goodman (with special guest Ken Peplowski) and the collaborations between Miles Davis and Gil Evans – \"Porgy & Bess\", \"Sketches of Spain\" (both with Gerard Presencer as trumpet soloist) and \"Miles Ahead\" (with Ingrid Jensen). SNJO has presented the music of Charles Mingus, Oliver Nelson, Benny Carter, Stan Kenton, Thelonious Monk, Steely Dan, Astor Piazzolla, and Pat Metheny (with guitarists Jim Mullen, Phil Robson, Mike Walker and Kevin MacKenzie) and premiered special commissions by Keith Tippett, Florian Ross, and Geoffrey Keezer, as well as specially commissioned arrangements of John Coltrane, Chick Corea (with drummer Gary Novak), Wayne Shorter featuring Gary Burton, Electric Miles featuring John Scofield, Weather Report featuring Peter Erskine, and Kurt Elling.\n\nIn addition, SNJO has performed music by contemporary jazz musicians. These include Kenny Wheeler's \"Sweet Sister Suite\"; Joe Lovano's \"Celebrating Sinatra\" with arrangements by Manny Albam; the music of Maria Schneider conducted by the composer; and Smith's \"Planet Wave\", a large-scale composition made possible by the Arts Foundation/Barclays Bank jazz composition fellowship prize which marries Smith's music to text by poet Edwin Morgan. The concerts with Lovano also featured the premiere of Smith's \"Torah\", a work based on the first five books of the Bible in which a titanic struggle occurs between good and evil. Written over seventy days, the fifty-minute composition was created for Lovano and SNJO. During the same evening that \"Torah\" was being premiered in Scotland, Cleo Laine and John Dankworth premiered \"The Morning of the Imminent\" by Smith and Morgan at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\n\nIn 1989 Smith performed \"An Rathad ùr\", a concerto for saxophone by William Sweeney, with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra for the television series \"Jazz Types\", which Smith also presented. Prompted by Roger Pollen of the Scottish Ensemble, he spent six months studying orchestration for strings with a commission for saxophone and strings very much in mind. As a Blue Note musician at the time, Smith had access to the parent company EMI's classical catalogue. He researched orchestration texts by Samuel Adler, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Cecil Forsyth, and spent two productive years in Paris where he studied classical music. He wrote his first classical composition, \"Unirsi in Matrimonio\", for saxophone and strings in 1990. This was followed by another work for strings and saxophone, \"Un Ecossais A Paris\" in 1991, and he collaborated with classical pianist (Murray McLachlan) for \"Sonata No.1 - Hall of Mirrors\" and \"Sonata No.2 Dreaming with Open Eyes\", both for saxophone and piano.\n\nThe next seven years were spent preparing for a much bigger orchestral work, the saxophone concerto \"Hiroshima\" (1998). This was premiered with the Orchestra of St. John Smith's Square at Chelmsford Cathedral and included strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, piano, and saxophone. Smith appeared as solo saxophonist for Sally Beamish's \"The Knotgrass Elegy\", commissioned for the 2001 BBC Proms, and performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In 2002, Smith performed his earlier and much lengthier re-invention of \"Children's Songs\" for saxophone and orchestra with the Scottish Ensemble at St John's Kirk, Perth. Other classical music endeavours have included a massive undertaking for the Edinburgh Youth Orchestra's 40th anniversary in 2003. A suite, entitled \"Edinburgh\", was written for the occasion with saxophone, bass, drums, and a one hundred person symphony orchestra. The work toured Scotland, Estonia, Russia, and Finland\n\n\nWith the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra\n\nWith the Tommy Smith Youth Jazz Orchestra\n\nWith Arild Andersen and Paolo Vinaccia\n\n\n"}

The counterfeiter pleads ignorance and is subsequently killed. Tommy 'Hopscotch' Hopkins, who has the money, learns of the death of the counterfeiter and begins to fear for his own safety. Consequently, he asks his friend, the street smart Frankie (who owns a strip club), to assist him in an exchange of the fake money for real money which he has organised with some acquaintances. Frankie reluctantly agrees to assist his friend.\n\nThe two attend the venue of the exchange, which is the house of an undercover police officer, Danny who uses the alias Paco. Danny believes that he is being assisted by two FBI agents in order to arrest Frankie and Hopscotch. Instead the other two men shoot and kill Danny and attempt to kill Frankie and Hopscotch. Frankie manages to shoot the two men after they kill Danny and he and Hopscotch flee the house with the real and the fake money which is contained in three suitcases. Frankie also pulls some paper out of the jacket of one of the two purported FBI agents. The shootout is witnessed by Danny's sister Colleen, who was hiding in the house. Distraught, she mistakenly believes that Frankie killed her brother and provides the police with his description. After fleeing the scene, Frankie escorts Hopscotch to the house of the latter's brother, Marty. Frankie advises Hopscotch to lie low while he conjures up a plan of what to do with the money. Marty seems concerned that his brother is associating with someone like Frankie. \n\nColleen is comforted by the colleagues of her dead brother Danny, including his boss Captain Evans. He advises her that they will do whatever is necessary to find Danny's killers. The investigation into Danny's death is led by Vic, who is Colleen's former lover. It transpires that Vic had ended his relationship with Colleen acrimoniously years previously. Despite their troubled past, he spends time with Colleen to help her combat her grief. However, struggling to restrain her emotions, Colleen becomes frustrated with the investigation into her brother's death as she begins to believe that little progress is being made. As she persistently approaches Captain Evans, in a vexed mood, he advises her that they believe Danny was a 'dirty' cop, something which, based on her knowledge of her brother's character, she strenuously refutes. As a result, she loses faith with her brother's former colleagues and decides to conduct her own investigations. She manages to track down Frankie and asks to be allowed to perform at his strip club. He admits that she is pretty enough to do the job, but states that she ought to think it over before making any commitment.\n\nMeanwhile, after Frankie is attacked by the two masked men who killed the counterfeiter, he and Hopscotch decide to bury the three suitcases of money in the desert to ensure that they are safe. After burying the money Hopscotch is killed and Frankie is forced to engage in a shootout with the killer. The killer is revealed to be one of the two masked men and Hopscotch's brother, Marty. Frankie persuades Marty to inform him of the identity of the other masked man who he soon learns is Vic. In a show of disloyalty, Vic kills Marty and requests that Frankie tell him of the whereabouts of the money. Frankie declines to do so and returns to his strip club, where in a private performance he watches Colleen audition for a job. Afterwards, Frankie takes Colleen to his apartment where they begin kissing. Suddenly, Colleen pulls out a gun and confronts Frankie about the death of her brother. Frankie is initially confused but then elucidates upon the events of the shoot out. He advises her that Danny appeared to trust the other two men who were in the room at his house when he was killed and that they turned on him. To convince Colleen that he is telling the truth he manipulates the gun so that Colleen only needs to pull the trigger in order to kill him. \n\nColleen believes Frankie and he escorts her to her car so that she can travel home. Vic sees Frankie and Colleen together and when Colleen is gone he advises Frankie to stay away from her. The next day Frankie visits Colleen and produces the piece of paper that he took from the purported FBI agent. The piece of paper is part of a map with directions on it in red ink. Frankie advises Colleen that he believes that Vic was involved in her brother's killing. He tells her to tell Vic's superiors in the police and take them to the desert. While Colleen travels to the police station, Frankie advises Vic that he has changed his mind and that he will share the money with him. Frankie and Vic drive to the desert where they dig up the cases with the money in. Meanwhile Colleen and Captain Evans arrive at the desert. Evans advises Colleen to wait in the car as he investigates. As he leaves in pursuit of Vic and Frankie, she finds the other half of the map on the dashboard of the car. Evans walks up a hill and sees Frankie and Vic with the cases of money. Vic manages to hit Frankie with a spade in an attempt to take all of the money for himself after which Evans confronts him. At this point Colleen arrives and Evans shoots Vic in an attempt to conceal his guilt in the affair. He then hugs Colleen and tells her that it is all over. Colleen, now aware that both Vic and Evans were responsible for her brother's death then shoots Evans. Afterwards she and Frankie arrange Vic's and Evans' bodies to make it seem as though they had killed each other in a dispute over one of the cases of money. They then walk off with the other two cases of money and with their arms around each other.\n\n\nBruce Payne and Elizabeth Gracen both played Immortals in the popular Highlander franchise.\n\nThe TV Guide website has given the film a rating of 2.5 out of 4. A reviewer for the \"TV Guide\" stated that 'Frankie's slablike features and seedy-cool demeanor initially makes him just one outsized thug among many, but Payne gradually warms up the protagonist and balances nicely against Hawkes's scenery-chewing Joe Pesci act'.\n"}

It is the third installment in the \"Lords of the Realm\" series, and the last game made by Impressions Games.\n\nAt the start of a game, the player must choose a noble by either selecting one of the default nobles or creating a new one. Nobles act as user accounts within the game, wherein completed campaigns and saved games are local to each noble. A noble consists of three customizable features: \"housename\", \"portrait\", and \"heraldry\".\n\nOnce a noble is selected, the player can choose to play a campaign or battle map, or load a saved game. While all the battle maps are available when a noble is created, the campaigns require that the player complete each level in sequence. The game has four campaigns, each with several scenarios.\n\nIn a battle map, the player is placed in a battlefield and is provided with predefined companies of soldiers available to them. The only victory condition of these battles is to defeat all enemy companies. The gameplay is consistent with that of the battle mode in the campaigns.\n\nExcept for the tutorials, campaigns consist of three layers of gameplay: the \"strategy layer\", the \"diplomacy layer\", and the \"battle layer\". The layers allow the player to control different components of the game.\n\nThe strategy layer allows the player to see a large overview of the lands to command their armies and assign vassals to the lands they possess. The land that the player possesses is subdivided into parcels. The player must assign a vassal to each parcel to manage the land for them.\n\nThere are several different types of parcels that dictate what they will produce. Furthermore, each parcel is of a certain quality which determines how fast they will upgrade their land and produce units. The different categories of vassals are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the diplomacy screen, the player may assess his progress and the progress of the other nobles as well as engage in politics such as trade, war declarations, and forming alliances. The diplomacy screen shows a diplomatic map of all the lands, colored by the nobles who own them, that displays parcel usage, army locations, and territorial control. The player can view their \"chivalry\", \"Christianity\", and \"honor\" levels, and their progress in obtaining the next level in each of them.\n\nThe battle layer engages the player in the battlefield, allowing them to manually control their companies.\n\n\"Lords of the Realm III\" received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. A common complaint was, relative to its predecessors, the simplification of province management and the departure from the turn-based strategy map.\n\n\"Lords of the Realm III\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Games Magazine\"s 2004 \"Best Budget Game\" award, but lost to \"The Political Machine\".\n"}

It was developed by Intel Corporation and was adopted as the IEEE 796 bus.\n\nThe Multibus specification was important because it was a robust, well-thought out industry standard with a relatively large form factor, so complex devices could be designed on it. Because it was a well-defined and well-documented industry standard, it allowed a Multibus-compatible industry to grow around it, with many companies making card cages and enclosures for it. Many others made CPU, memory, and other peripheral boards. In 1982 there were over 100 Multibus board and systems manufacturers. This allowed complex systems to be built from commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and also allowed companies to innovate by designing a proprietary Multibus board and then integrating it with other vendors' hardware to create a system. A good example of this was Sun Microsystems with their Sun-1 and Sun-2 workstations. Sun built custom-designed CPU, memory, SCSI, and video display boards, and then added 3Com Ethernet networking boards, Xylogics SMD disk controllers, Ciprico Tapemaster 1/2 inch tape controllers, Sky Floating Point Processor, and Systech 16-port Terminal Interfaces in order to configure the system as a workstation or a file server. Other workstation vendors who used Multibus-based designs included HP/Apollo and Silicon Graphics.\n\nThe Intel Multibus I & II product line was purchased from Intel by RadiSys Corporation, which in 2002 was then purchased by U.S. Technologies, Inc.\n\nMultibus is an asynchronous bus that accommodates devices with various transfer rates while maintaining maximum throughput. It had 20 address lines so it could address up to 1 Mb of Multibus memory and 1 Mb of I/O locations. Most Multibus I/O devices only decoded the first 64 Kb of address space.\n\nMultibus supported multi-master functionality that allowed it to share the Multibus with multiple processors and other DMA devices.\n\nThe standard Multibus form factor was a , circuit board with two ejection levers on the front edge. The board had two buses. The wider P1 bus which pin assignment was defined by the Multibus specification. A second smaller P2 bus was also defined as a private bus.\n\nMultibus includes the following buses:\n\nIEEE-796: Microcomputer System Bus; First released by Intel in 1974. The cards did not use front panels, and they used card edge fingers as the connectors (similar to ISA/PC-AT cards). Companies like Northwest Technical still provide \"End of Life\" products for Multibus I. This bus is obsolete.\n\nIEEE-1296 32-bit/10 MHz bus, at 40 Mbyte/s. Card sizes are 3U x 220 mm, and 6U x 220 mm. These cards are larger than the VME Eurocard sizes, which are 3U/6U x 160mm. It uses TTL (\"Fast\" series) gates for drivers and the Backplane Connectors are DIN 41612 type C. Multibus II is not yet considered obsolete, but considered mature; however it is not recommended for new designs. IEEE-STD-1296: High-performance synchronous 32-bit bus: Multibus II, released in 1987, and 1994. Also as ISO/IEC 10861.\n\nMultibus-II hardware running the iRMX operating system is used in the majority of the core Automatic Train Supervision subsystems on CLSCS, the London Underground Central line Signals Control System. This was supplied by Westinghouse Rail Systems and commissioned from the mid-1990s. The Central line is an Automatic Train Operation line. The Automatic Train Supervision elements use a mixture of iRMX on Multibus, and Solaris on SPARC computers. Sixteen Multibus-based Local Site Computers are distributed along the line together with six central Multibus-based subsystems in the control centre. Real time control and communications functions are provided by the Multibus-based processors and Sun workstations provide database functions and the operator consoles in the control room. All subsystem computers are dual redundant. The safety-critical Automatic Train Protection component is provided by trackside and train-borne equipment that does not use Multibus. The system was still in full operation . In the control centre, Westinghouse also provided a cut-down mimic of the system for staff training and software test purposes using much of the same hardware and software as the full ATS system, but connected to a computer (also Multibus-II and Sun based) to simulate train movements and signalling behaviour.\n\nOslo Metro or Oslo Tunnelbane uses a similar, although less complex Westinghouse-supplied Multibus hardware control system through the central Common Tunnel or Fellestunnelen tracks, but was expected to be decommissioned in 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2031817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031817", "title": "The Equalizer", "text": "The Equalizer\n\nThe Equalizer is an American crime drama television series, originally airing on CBS from fall 1985 until late spring 1989. It starred Edward Woodward as a retired intelligence agent with a mysterious past, who uses the skills from his former career to exact justice on behalf of innocent people who are trapped in dangerous circumstances. The series combined elements of the spy, private investigator/police procedural, and vigilante genres.\n\nThe series starred British actor Edward Woodward as Robert McCall, a former covert operations officer of an unnamed US government intelligence organization, which was often referred to simply as \"The Agency\" or \"The Company\", who tried to atone for his past by offering, usually free of charge, his services as a troubleshooter, a protector, and an investigator.\n\nPeople in need found him through a newspaper classified ad: \"Got a problem? Odds against you? Call the Equalizer: 212 555 4200.\" When he began this business in the pilot episode, it was revealed the nickname \"Equalizer\" was bestowed on him by an operative named \"Brahms\", played by Jerry Stiller.\n\nAided by a group of sometimes-mysterious contacts, some of whom dated back to his spying days, McCall traversed the streets of New York City, delivered justice upon bullies, corrupt police and politicians, hoodlums, mobsters, rapists, racists, murderers, kidnappers, drug dealers, and other \"truly deserving\" people. \"Please do not do anything you will never live to regret,\" he tells one villain.\n\nHis contacts were also prone to human foibles, that ranged from egoism to domestic problems.\n\nMany episodes focused on McCall interacting with \"Control\" (played by Robert Lansing), the unnamed head of the Manhattan office of the secret organization which McCall used to work for. As a general rule, however, the people answering the newspaper ad were unremarkable, average, and unknown.\n\nMcCall's car, weapons, and other gadgetry at times featured significantly as elements in the plot.\n\n\n\nThe show had quite a number of notable guest stars, many of whom became major stars within a few years of their appearances. Eight-year-old Macaulay Culkin appeared in one episode as a kidnap victim. Nine-year-old Melissa Joan Hart appeared as a young girl whom McCall protected from her ex-con father. Christian Slater appeared as a high-school student in the episode \"Joyride\". Kevin Spacey played a corrupt police officer. Ed O'Neill played a doctor in the first-season episode \"The Children's Song\". John Goodman played a single father who was tricked by co-worker Joe Morton into taking part in a robbery. Goodman's frequent co-star Steve Buscemi appeared in the same episode, which marks the first time the two were on screen together.\n\nStewart Copeland, who composed the show's theme song and much of its music, made a cameo as a pickpocket. Vincent D'Onofrio appeared twice in the series, playing the arsonist son of a mobster in his first appearance, and a mentally-challenged man falsely accused of murder in his second. Adam Ant played a villain in an episode that also featured J.T. Walsh, David Alan Grier, Lori Petty and Luis Guzman. Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys made a rare acting appearance in an episode alongside Alex Winter. Bradley Whitford appeared as a brutal young thug whose terrorizing of a hitch-hiking young couple leads to a siege of the weaponless McCall and his son who are away on a father-son weekend. Melissa Sue Anderson played McCall's daughter (unbeknownst to herself) by an old girlfriend; in real life, Anderson was, and is the wife of series co-creator Michael Sloan. Frank Whaley, Sam Rockwell, and Jerry O'Connell appeared in the same episode as members of a teen robbery gang. Shelby Anderson lent her singing ability as a lounge singer in an episode that also involved her giant panda, ZhenZhen. Singer Vitamin C appeared in two episodes under her real name, Colleen Ann Fitzpatrick.\n\nOther well-known stars at the time, as well as future stars, who appeared on the show included Robert Mitchum, Telly Savalas, Maureen Stapleton, E. G. Marshall, Laurence Fishburne, Jane Kaczmarek, Lauren Tom, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Grey, Reginald VelJohnson, Quentin Crisp, Laurie Metcalf, Frances Fisher, Oliver Platt, Patricia Richardson, William H. Macy, Robin Curtis, Roma Maffia, Olympia Dukakis, Michael Moriarty, Chris Cooper, Michael Rooker, David Strathairn, Charles S. Dutton, Cynthia Nixon, Bruce Payne, Laura San Giacomo, Kasi Lemmons, Al Leong, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Daniel Davis, Jon Polito, Jasmine Guy, Mark Linn-Baker, Meat Loaf, Lori Loughlin, Michael Wincott, Tony Shalhoub, Anthony Zerbe, Michael Cerveris, Giancarlo Esposito and the singing duo of Ashford and Simpson.\n\nThe series also made good use of its New York City filming location/setting by employing actors who were appearing on Broadway in the late 1980s as guest stars. These included Terrence Mann, Frances Ruffelle, Kevin Conway, J. Smith-Cameron, Philip Bosco, Caitlin Clarke, Josef Sommer, Jim Dale, Christine Baranski, and Anne Twomey.\n\nAdditionally, several former stage, and screen co-stars of Edward Woodward appeared on the show. These included Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes (real-life mother of the aforementioned Ms. Plummer), Gwen Verdon, Sandy Dennis, Jenny Agutter, Shirley Knight, and Sylvia Sidney. Harvard-educated Shakespearean theatre, Broadway stage, screen and film actor Richard Jordan appeared as the character Harley Gage in 10 episodes.\n\nWoodward's second wife, Michele Dotrice, appeared as the central character in the season 2 episode, \"Heartstrings\". Her father, Roy Dotrice, also guest-starred on the show in season 4's \"Trial By Ordeal\". Edward Woodward's son, actor Tim Woodward, appeared as McCall's father in a flashback scene in the episode \"Prisoners of Conscience\", also in season 4.\n\nThe show's theme music was created by composer/performer Stewart Copeland. The track is called ‘Busy Equalizing’. An extended version appears on his album \"The Equalizer and Other Cliff Hangers.\"\n\nSix episodes in the 1988 season were scored by Joseph Conlan and the final season was scored by Cameron Allan.\n\nThe show ran for four seasons of 22 episodes each. It was initially renewed for a fifth season (causing Keith Szarabajka to turn down a role on \"Midnight Caller\"). However, the show was later canceled due to a row between CBS and Universal Studios over the renewal of \"Murder, She Wrote\".\n\nIn \"The Story of The Equalizer\", created for the DVD box set, executive producer Coleman Luck also stated that Universal requested a script for a crossover episode with \"Magnum, P.I.\" despite the objections of the crew due to the vastly different tones of the two shows. Ultimately, the crossover did not happen and the episode was re-written as \"Beyond Control\".\n\nAfter the broadcast of the first episode in September 1985, the show received mixed reviews. Critic Tom Shales wrote in The Washington Post that \"to judge from this very attractively atmospheric premiere [the show] could become a welcome guest in many an American home\". However, for People, Jeff Jarvis wrote \"The plot’s confusing and the show’s as erratic as a pacemaker on low batteries\".\n\nOn February 12, 2008, Universal Studios released Season 1 of \"The Equalizer\" on DVD-Video in Region 1 (US only).\n\nOn May 15, 2013, it was announced that Visual Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1. They subsequently released season 2 on DVD on August 26, 2014. Season 3 was released on October 25, 2014, followed by season 4 on November 24, 2014.\n\nVisual Entertainment also released a limited edition complete series set on DVD on August 19, 2014. \"The Equalizer Complete Collection Limited Edition\" set contains all 88 episodes plus 12 hours of bonus content including \"\"; the last film ever done by Edward Woodward, \"A Congregation of Ghosts\"; and \"The Story of The Equalizer\" featuring interviews with cast and crew.\n\nIn Region 2, Universal Playback UK released season 1 on DVD on April 21, 2008. In late 2011, Fabulous Films announced that they had acquired the rights to the series. They have subsequently released seasons 2–4. On May 27, 2013, Fabulous Films released \"The Equalizer: The Complete Collection\" on DVD. This 24-disc box set contains all 88 episodes of the series as well as bonus content including an all-new documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew.\n\nMany fans have noted that the Region 1 version has had several of the originally used songs replaced. In actual fact nearly 50 per cent of all music apart from the theme, and scoring by Stewart Copeland has been replaced by \"covers\" due to expired music licensing agreements, and the costs which would be incurred in the US to have the licensing renewed. In contrast, the Region 2 version contains all of the original music intact.\n\nIn Region 4, Umbrella Entertainment has released all four seasons on DVD in Australia.\n\nA film starring Denzel Washington in the title role, very loosely based upon the series, was released in September 2014.\n\nA sequel film, \"The Equalizer 2\", was released on July 20, 2018.\n\nMelissa Leo, who was a guest star in \"The Defector,\" the third episode of the TV series, appears in both movies.\n\nOn November 2019, CBS announced that a reboot is in development with Queen Latifah in the lead role as Robyn McCall. Andrew Marlowe and Terri Miller will serve as showrunners with Latifah herself as an executive producer. On January 27, 2020, CBS issued a pilot order for the new version.\n\nThe series was among the 14 pilots ordered by CBS in February 2020 and was fast tracked to series the following March, as they are unable to film their pilots where Universal Television was shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn May 8, 2020, CBS picked up the series and they added Chris Noth as William Bishop, a quirky ex-CIA director is the opposite of Latifah.\n\nA collection of novels featuring Robert McCall have been written by the original co-creator Michael Sloan. The first is simply entitled \"The Equalizer\" published in 2014, followed by \"Killed in Action: An Equalizer Novel\", which was released in 2018. The novels are a modern reimagining of the original series and focus on McCall leaving The Company and eventually becoming a private investigator in New York. It also features a number of original recurring characters from the television series such as Mickey Kostmayer, Control and Scott McCall. A third novel, \"Requiem: An Equalizer Novel\" is currently in the works.\n\n\"The Equalizer\" was spoofed by the short-lived Saturday morning TV series \"Flip!\" with a series of short films titled The Get-Even Guy. These starred a teenage boy in a trench coat who sported obviously-dyed hair and an affected UK accent. He would regularly come to the aid of peers who were being treated in an unfair manner by various authority figures, including a middle-school gym-teacher and a video store-clerk.\n\nThe Get-Even Guy never used a real weapon or seriously injured anyone, but rather used whatever was on hand to humiliate his adversary...such as ordinary athletic equipment, or an ordinary VHS cassette (the tape from which was used to entangle the dastardly clerk).\n\n"}
{"id": "2031833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031833", "title": "Glitter (soundtrack)", "text": "Glitter (soundtrack)\n\nGlitter is the soundtrack to the 2001 film of the same name and the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, released on August 18, 2001 in Japan by Sony Music and worldwide on September 11, 2001 by Virgin Records. It was a complete musical departure from any of Carey's previous releases, focusing heavily on recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. By covering or heavily sampling several older tunes and songs, Carey created \"Glitter\" as an album that would help viewers connect with the film, as well as incorporating newly written ballads. The singer collaborated with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and DJ Clue, who co-produced the album.\n\nMusically, \"Glitter\" was structured to be a retro-influenced album and have more of a dance-oriented element. On several songs, critics noted Carey to be more sexually suggestive lyrically than before, in part due to the inclusion of several guest hip hop musicians. \"Glitter\" featured several other musical acts such as Eric Benét, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Fabolous, and Ja Rule.\n\nUpon release, both the album and its accompanying film were met with generally negative reviews from critics, who felt it failed in trying to capture a genuine 1980s theme, and there were too many guest appearances. Retrospective reviews, however, have been largely positive, with many saying the album was unfairly maligned. Universally, \"Glitter\" was viewed as a commercial and critical failure, leading to Virgin Records cancelling Carey's $100 million five-album contract and dropping her from the label. While it debuted at number seven on the US \"Billboard\" 200, it was Carey's lowest-first week sales of any album she had ever released. Internationally, it peaked outside the top-ten in many countries, but topped the charts in Japan. \"Glitter\" became Carey's least successful album at the time, selling two million copies worldwide.\n\nSeveral singles were released but attained weak charting positions. \"Loverboy\" served as the lead single from the album and quickly became Carey's lowest-charting lead single globally. As the song stalled on the American charts, Virgin dropped its price to spur sales, which helped the single peak at number two on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100; internationally, the song failed to garner much traction. Subsequent singles failed to make much of an impact on prominent global charts, with some not charting at all. Nearly two decades after its release, \"Glitter\" began to attract wide praise from mainstream critics and has developed a cult following.\n\nOn May 22, 2020, after many years of Glitter's absence from streaming services, on social media, Carey announced its availability \"everywhere\" while also revealing updated artwork for the album's singles \"Loverboy,\" \"Lead the Way\" and \"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\".\n\nFollowing the release of Carey's album \"Butterfly\" in 1997, she began working on a film and soundtrack project titled at that time as \"All That Glitters\". However, Columbia Records and Carey were also working on a greatest hits album to be released in time for Thanksgiving season in November 1998. Carey put \"All That Glitters\" on hold and her greatest hits album \"#1's\" was released in November 1998. Carey put the project on hold again to record her album \"Rainbow\" (1999). After the album ran its course, Carey wanted to finish the film and soundtrack project. But by this time, Carey and her now ex-husband Tommy Mottola, head of her record company Columbia, did not have a good working or personal relationship. Mottola wanted Carey off the label and Carey wanted to leave; however, she still owed Columbia one more album to fulfill her contract. Virgin Records stepped in and offered to pay Columbia $20 million to let Carey out of her contract early so that they could sign her for an $100 million deal.\n\nCarey signed with Virgin and aimed to complete the film and soundtrack project. As part of her contract on her $100 million five-album record deal with Virgin Records, Carey was given full creative control. She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go with the film's setting. As the release date grew nearer, the film and album title were changed from \"All That Glitters\" to \"Glitter\". In early 2001, Carey's relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended, while she was busy filming \"Glitter\" and recording the soundtrack. Due to the pressure of losing her relationship, being on a new record label, filming a movie, and recording an album, Carey began to have a nervous breakdown. She began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior while on several promotional outings.\n\nMusically, \"Glitter\" was notably different from anything Carey had ever written or recorded, drawing influence from the 1980s. Due to the parent film taking place in 1983, the soundtrack harbored on recreating an older sound, while incorporating the usual ballads for which Carey was known. While some critics favored the album's retro style, and inclusion of several sampled melodies, many felt that \"Glitter\" lacked originality, and its excess of guest artists overpowered Carey's artistry. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the album's content, as well as its influences:\n\nThere are songs that are definitely going to take people back and make them go, 'Oh, man, this song from the '80s — I loved it growing up'. Or people who never heard the songs before might be like, 'This is cool.' When you see the movie, you're gonna see the uptempo songs and the songs that are remakes in there as they would have sounded in the '80s, but the album is the way that I would make the record now, and the ballads can stand on their own as songs from a Mariah Carey album.\n\nServing as the project's lead single, \"Loverboy\" features a sample from \"Candy\" by American band Cameo, which interpolates the melody into the chorus and instrumental introduction. Additionally, aside from sampling \"Candy\" as the musical bed for the song, Cameo serves as a featured artist on the song. Sarah Rodman from the \"Boston Herald\" compared it to Carey's previous lead singles, and described its production as \"another in an increasingly long line of glitzy, candy-coated, creatively stunted Carey songs\". The song's lyrics and vocals were described as \"super-sexed\" by Sal Cinquemani from \"Slant Magazine\" when put into comparison with Carey's previous work. The official remix for \"Loverboy\" also earned a place on \"Glitter\", adding rap verses from both Ludacris and Da Brat to the original version. Serving as the second single from \"Glitter\", \"Reflections (Care Enough)\" was written by Carey and Philippe Pierre. Lyrically, the song'a protagonist \"laments the end of a relationship\", while confronting her mother regarding her early abandonment. Additionally, during its bridge, Carey \"eerily\" refers to abortion, \"You could have had the decency / To give me up / Before you gave me life\", as an option over abandoning the child. Cinquemani felt the song was reminiscent of Carey's ballads during the earlier lengths of her career, and described the song as a \"simple beauty\". In a review for the album in \"The Free Lance–Star\", a writer outed the song's first verse \"A displaced little girl / Wept years in silence / And whispers wishes you'd materialize / She pressed on night and day / To keep on living / And tried so many ways / To keep her soul alive\" as his favorite lyric from \"Glitter\", and described it as an \"emotional and heart-wrenching ballad\". The album's third release, \"Never Too Far\", was written and produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Described as an \"adult-contemporary, slow-jam love song\", the song's lyrics read \"Too painful to talk about it, so I hold it in / So my heart can mend and be brave enough to love again\", speaking of emotions felt by the protagonist in the film. \"Never Too Far\" features \"a bed of synthesized strings, gentle drums and Spanish-style guitar\" as its primary instrumentation, and incorporates violin and keyboard notes prior to the first verse. The fourth and final single from \"Glitter\", \"Don't Stop (Funkin' 4 Jamaica)\", was composed by Carey and DJ Clue, and interpolates \"Funkin' for Jamaica (N.Y.)\" by Tom Browne. Featuring guest verses from Mystikal, with the former declaring \"Ain't nothin' you could do with the man / Except for shake your ass and clap your hands\", while Carey responds \"Don't stop bay-beee, its ex-ta-see / Turn me up a little.\" Conceptualized in 1997, \"Lead the Way\" was an unused track from \"Butterfly\" (1997), written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. The ballad was the last song composed by the pair, as they halted work with one another shortly after its completion, due to their growing creative differences. Though written, the song was recorded during 2000, as Carey began producing \"Glitter\". Beginning with a classic and simple piano introduction, Carey starts the song with soft and breathy vocals, eventually leading to a vocal climax, in which she belts an 18-second note, the longest from any of her recordings. She described it as one of her \"best vocal performances\", as well as one of her \"favorite songs.\" In an interview with MTV News, Carey addressed \"Glitter\" as well as \"Lead the Way\":\nTo me, \"Glitter\" is one of my best albums. A lot of people got confused, not knowing whether it was a soundtrack or an album or what. There's a song called 'Lead the Way' which I did on \"Ally McBeal\", and it's coming out in January. I sang the song on [the show]. It's one of those ballads that basically everybody that's been following my career says reminds them of a 'Vision of Love'-type record, and that's one of my favorite songs from the record. The cool thing for me is to be able to tie in 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. Having the Greatest Hits coming out, to be able to tie in both those records is almost like a circle.\n\nCarey's cover of the 1982 Indeep song \"Last Night a D.J. Saved My Life\" was one of the album's more club-themed songs. It features rappers Fabolous and Busta Rhymes, and was composed and produced by Carey and DJ Clue. Michael Paoletta from \"Billboard\" called it a \"painful low\" on \"Glitter\", and commented how Carey seemed detached and over-powered on the song, due to the inclusion of several male guests. \"Twister\", another one of the album's ballads, drew strong comparisons to Carey's older work, in light of the very different remainder of the album. Paoletta called it \"quietly heartbreaking\", in reference to the song's lyrics, which relate to the suicide of Carey's friend and hairstylist, Tonjua Twist. According to Carey, Twist took her own life in the spring of 2000, and was known for her joy of life and her ability to put people at ease. She was \"child like and effervescent\", but behind her mask of happiness was \"a well\" of lifelong and deep-rooted pain. In \"Twister\", Carey described the hidden inner-struggle of her friend, and tried to find \"closure\"; her \"way of saying goodbye\". Chris Chuck from \"Daily News\" described its lyrics as \"an airy requiem for a friend lost to suicide\" and felt it was \"the only memorable song on the album.\" With lyrics reading \"Feelin' kinda fragile and I've got a lot to handle / But I guess this is my way of saying goodbye\", David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that Carey was possibly referring to her own suicide rather than her friends, especially in light of the events that were taking place during the album's release. \"Didn't Mean to Turn You On\" is a cover of the 1984 Cherelle song of the same title. Aside from the heavy sampling of the hook and lyrics, Carey, who produced the song alongside Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, added keyboard notes and synthesizers to enhance the songs club appeal. In the song, Carey sings \"I was only trying to be nice / Only trying to be nice / Sooooooo, I didn't mean to turn you on\", indicating a woman who is weakly apologetic over fooling a man over intimacy. On the track \"Want You\", American singer Eric Benét duets with Carey, while lyrically implying and suggesting the \"exploration of bedroom fantasies.\"\n\nOn the website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score, the album received a 59/100, indicating \"generally mixed or average reviews.\" AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album one and a half out of five stars, calling it an \"utter meltdown -- the pop equivalent of Chernobyl\" and wrote \"It's an embarrassment, one that might have been easier to gawk at if its creator wasn't so close to emotional destruction at the time of release.\" Michael Paoletta from \"Billboard\" was less critical, citing it as a \"minor misstep in a stellar career that has earned the singer a few free passes. Editor Sarah Rodman from \"The Boston Herald\" gave \"Glitter\" a mixed review, praising Carey's song-writing and voice, although panning the excess of secondary musical guests. While criticizing the album's roster of appearances, Rodman wrote \"the artists contribute mostly distracting, self-promoting jibber jabber all over what could have been Carey's best, most emotionally mature record to date.\" \"Daily News\" editor Chuck Campley rated the album two and a half out of five stars, writing \"Maybe this was the best Mariah Carey could muster under the circumstances, but 'Glitter' needed more work.\" David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave \"Glitter\" a mixed review, criticizing the abundance of rappers and describing Carey's vocals as \"barely there\" on several tracks. Concluding his review on a poor note, Browne wrote \"'Glitter' is a mess, but its shameless genre hopping (and Carey's crash) makes it an unintentional concept album about the toll of relentless careerism.\"\n\nHeather Vaughn from \"The Free-Lance Star\" gave \"Glitter\" a positive review, complimenting both the dance-oriented tracks, as well as the ballads. In reference to their weight on the album as a whole, Vaughn wrote \"Sounds like Mariah's other albums, but with more of an 80s twist. The ballads really let you hear how stunning her voice actually is.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" critic and writer Natalie Nichols gave \"Glitter\" two out of a possible four stars, writing how Carey let the album \"reflect the synth-driven robo-funk of that wretched decade.\" Nichols called the album's covers \"tepid and pointless\", while agreeing that Carey was overwhelmed by the many guest rappers, calling her voice \"semi-disguised\". Rob Sheffield from \"Rolling Stone\" gave the album three out of five stars, criticizing the ballads as \"big and goopy, with zero melodic or emotional punch.\" Aside from the ballads, Sheffield felt \"Glitter\" failed to deliver the success or quality that Carey needed on her debut film and soundtrack. He concluded his review of the album with a comparison to Whitney Houston's massive \"The Bodyguard\" (1992), \"Mariah still hasn't found her theme song, the one people will remember her voice by. \"Glitter\" is good enough to make you hope she finds it.\" \"Slant Magazine\" editor Sal Cinquemani awarded \"Glitter\" three out of five stars, writing \"Carey's edgier tracks are inundated with so many guest artists that her sound ultimately becomes muddled; her pop tunes are so formulaic that it's difficult to distinguish one from the next.\" \"USA Today\"'s Edna Gunderson rated the album one and a half out of four stars, criticizing Carey's overall image for the project, as well as the many guest artists on the record. She described Carey as \"cheapening her image\" and wrote \"The whiff of desperation grows more pungent on 'Glitter' in Carey's gratuitous coloratura and transparent enlistment of street-cred boosters such as rappers Ja Rule and Mystikal.\n\n\"Glitter\" became Carey's least commercially successful album to that point. It debuted at number seven on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 116,000 copies, but far from the first-week sales of 323,000 with her previous release, \"Rainbow\" in 1999. \"Glitter\" became Carey's lowest peaking album in the United States, with her second album \"Emotions\" (1991), coming in at number four. It remained in the album's chart for only eight weeks, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 500,000 units; and as it fell from the charts, received platinum certification, denoting shipments of 1 million in the US. As of November 2018, Nielsen SoundScan estimates sales of the \"Glitter\" album at 666,000 copies in the United States. In Canada, the album peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart. \"Glitter\" entered the Australian Albums Chart at its peak position of number thirteen, during the week dated September 9, 2001. Remaining in the chart for only three weeks, the album made its exit at number forty on September 23. Similarly in Austria, \"Glitter\" peaked at number fourteen, remaining on the albums chart for only four weeks.\n\nIn both the Flemish and Wallonian territories in Belgium, \"Glitter\" peaked at numbers ten and eleven, respectively, while charting for a total of four weeks. In France, \"Glitter\" peaked at number five on the albums chart, during the week dated September 15, 2001. Following seventeen weeks fluctuating in the chart, the album was certified Gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), denoting shipments of 150,000 units. French sales of the album are estimated at 121,100 copies. On the Dutch Albums Chart, \"Glitter\" debuted at number twenty-six, during the week dated September 22, 2001. Reaching its peak position of number twelve the following week, the album remained a total of six weeks in the albums chart. In both New Zealand and Norway, \"Glitter\" peaked at number eleven, staying within the chart for four and one weeks, respectively. In Switzerland, the album peaked at number seven, and stayed within the chart for ten weeks. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified \"Glitter\" Gold in Switzerland, for shipments of 20,000 copies. On the UK Albums Chart dated September 22, 2001, the album made its debut at number ten. The following week, \"Glitter\" fell to number twenty-seven, staying in the chart for one more additional week. British sales of the album are at 55,080 units as of July 2014. In Japan, \"Glitter\" saw particular commercial success, debuting atop the albums chart and selling 450,000 units within a month of release. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide as of 2002.\n\nIn November 2018, the album became the subject of a campaign by Carey fans as part of the build-up to her fifteenth studio album, \"Caution\". This led to it reaching number one on the iTunes albums charts in several countries including the United States, and top 10 in several countries worldwide.\n\n\"Loverboy\" was released as the first single from \"Glitter\" on July 16, 2001. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with many both criticizing and praising the inclusion of the \"Candy\" sample. It became Carey's weakest charting lead single to date, reaching number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Following Carey's publicized hospitalization and breakdown, as well as Virgin's price reduction on the single, \"Loverboy\" managed to attain a new peak of number two on the chart. Although being propelled by high sales, radio airplay was still weak, due to many radio DJs feeling tepid towards its 1980s retro sound. Accompanied by little promotion from Carey, due to her hospitalization, \"Loverboy\" quickly descended the Hot 100. Outside the United States, the song attained weak charting, peaking inside the top ten in Australia and Canada, and within the top twenty in Italy and the United Kingdom. The music video for \"Loverboy\" features Carey dressed in a variation of revealing outfits, while patrolling a large race track as her 'loverboy' wins the race. The video was notable for portraying Carey in a more sexually oriented manner than before.\n\nThe second single released from \"Glitter\" was \"Reflections (Care Enough)\", which received a limited release in Japan on September 27, 2001. Following its limited promotional push from Virgin, and the absence of a music video, the song failed to make much of an impact. \"Never Too Far\", the album's third release, was released on October 23, 2001. It failed to impact the main \"Billboard\" chart, and achieved weak international charting. Carey was unable to film a music video for the single, as she was still recovering from her collapse. Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film \"Glitter\", where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story. The album's fourth and final single, \"Don't Stop (Funkin' 4 Jamaica)\", released on November 26, 2001, mirrored the same weak charting as \"Never Too Far\", although receiving more rotation on MTV due to its video. Directed by Sanaa Hamri, it features the theme of southern bayous and lifestyles, and presents Carey and Mystikal in \"southern style\" clothing and hairstyles. Some shots feature three versions of Carey singing into a microphone on the screen at one time.\n\nThroughout 2000, Carey had already been writing and recording material for \"Glitter\" and during this period, she developed the concept for \"Loverboy\". Originally, Carey had sampled the melody and hook from the 1978 Yellow Magic Orchestra song \"Firecracker\", using an interpolation of it throughout the chorus and introduction. In early theatrical trailers for \"Glitter\", the original version of \"Loverboy\" was still featured. As Carey had ended her contract with Columbia Records, Jennifer Lopez was signed by Tommy Mottola, and had begun recording material for her album, \"J.Lo\" (2001). According to record producer Irv Gotti, Mottola knew of Carey's usage of the \"Firecracker\" sample, and attempted to have Lopez use the same sample before her. At the time, Carey had become increasingly paranoid over outside executives being informed about \"Glitter\", especially following news of Lopez's \"theft\" of the song. When the music publishers for \"Firecracker\" were questioned, they admitted Carey had licensed usage of the sample first (and was in fact the first artist to ever request a license for a sample of that song), and Lopez had signed for it over one month later, under Mottola's arrangement. Ultimately Carey was not able to use the original sample, as Lopez's album was to be released far earlier than \"Glitter\". She subsequently changed the composition of \"Loverboy\", and incorporated a new sample, \"Candy\" by Cameo. The \"Firecracker\" sample was eventually used by Lopez on her song \"I'm Real\" and according to Gotti, Mottola contacted him with instructions to create the Murder Remix of \"I'm Real\" to sound exactly like another \"Glitter\" track he produced, titled \"If We\" featuring rappers Ja Rule and Nate Dogg.\n\nFollowing commencement for \"Glitter\" and the release of the soundtrack's lead single \"Loverboy\", Carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the song and its parent album. On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program \"Total Request Live\" (\"TRL\"). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey began singing \"Loverboy\" a cappella from behind a curtain. As he questioned the audience, she came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt. Seemingly anxious and exhilarated, Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while waving to the crowd down below on Times Square, and joking that the event was her \"therapy\". Carey then walked to Daly's platform and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim \"Mariah Carey has lost her mind!\" While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, she admitted that he was meant to act surprised in order to provide a more dramatic effect for the program. Carey's appearance on \"TRL\" garnered strong media attention, with many critics and newspapers citing her behavior as \"troubled\" and \"erratic\". This TRL appearance led many fans to believe that there was something going quite wrong with Carey behind the scenes.\n\nIn the days following her appearance on \"TRL\", Carey began displaying what was described as \"erratic behavior\". On July 20, Carey held a record signing for the CD single of \"Loverboy\" at Roosevelt Field shopping mall in Long Island before fans and the media. As a camera crew covered the event, she began rambling on several subjects before finally discussing radio-host Howard Stern and how his jokes about herself on his program bothered her greatly and how everything in life should be positive. At that point, Carey's publicist Cindi Berger grabbed the microphone from her hand, and asked the news crew to stop filming. Berger said later, \"She was not speaking clearly and not talking about what she had come to talk about: her record.\" Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website:\n\nI'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.\n\nFollowing the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been \"obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly\" when she posted the letters. Two days later on July 26, she was hospitalized, citing \"extreme exhaustion\" and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed Carey had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Following her induction at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, Carey remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.\n\nFollowing the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both \"Glitter\", as well as its soundtrack of the same name. The announcement was made on August 9, 2001, that both the soundtrack and the film would be postponed three weeks, respectively from August 21 to September 11, and from August 31 to September 21. When asked regarding the motives behind the delay, Nancy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Music Group Worldwide, addressed Carey's personal and physical condition:\n\nMariah is looking forward to being able to participate in both her album and movie projects and we are hopeful that this new soundtrack release date will allow her to do so. She has been making great recovery progress, and continues to grow stronger every day. Virgin Music Worldwide continues to give its absolute commitment and support to Mariah on every level.\n\nWhen discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed the terrorist attacks of September 11. Carey made specific remarks regarding the album's commercial failure stating, \"I released it on September 11, 2001. The talk shows needed something to distract from 9/11. I became a punching bag. I was so successful that they tore me down because my album was at number 2 instead of number 1. The media was laughing at me and attacked me.\"\n\n\"Glitter\" performed poorly at the box-office. And following the poor sales of the album as well, Virgin invoked a clause in its contract with Carey that allowed Virgin to get out of the $100 million deal for approximately $28 million. Subsequently, Virgin dropped Carey from the label roster. These decisions were brought on due to the low sales of the album, as well as the negative publicity surrounding her breakdown. While the two sides were laying out the terms for Carey's exit from Virgin, Carey's team requested that the two parties just use the word \"canceled\" when asked by the media regarding the failed venture. Less than 24 hours after the settlement was made, Virgin released a statement that they had \"terminated\" the contract with Carey, and paid her $28 million to do so. Carey's lawyers threatened to sue, with her attorney Marshall Grossman calling their behavior in the matter \"deplorable\". Virgin replied that in terms of Carey's payout, they only listed the money they gave her for departing, not including the $23.5 million they already had paid while under contract for the first and only album they released by her. Additionally, Virgin stated they would counter-sue Carey for \"defamation\" following Carey's press release. The matter was resolved outside of court, with Carey and Virgin opting not to take the matter to the judicial system. Soon after, Carey flew to Italy for a period of five months. After several months, Carey signed a new $20 million deal with Island Records, which also included Carey's own vanity label, MonarC Entertainment.\n\nAlmost two decades after its release, \"Glitter\" began to attract wide praise from mainstream critics and has developed a cult following. Kara Brown of \"Jezebel\" praised \"Glitter\" and cited: \"Mariah was ahead of us all and the time is now\". Mike Waas of \"Idolator\" commented that \"Glitter\" was \"a misunderstood [record]\" and called it \"the biggest pop music injustices of the 21st century\". Daniel Welsh of \"MSN\" gave the album a positive feedback and felt that \"the brilliance of \"Glitter\" has gone unappreciated for too long\". In a later article for \"Complex\", Michael Arceneaux described the album as \"the perfect ’80s tribute\". In a \"Vulture\" article, Dee Lockett described this record as \"undeniably ahead of its time even despite it being an homage to disco.\"\n\nIn 2017, Everett Brothers of \"Billboard\" ranked \"Lead the Way\" as the second most underappreciated song of Carey's discography, while \"There for Me\", a B-side track of \"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\" 2001 single, was picked as the third best song out this rate. Brothers argues that \"Lead the Way\" shows Carey's \"strongest vocal performance of the 2000s.\" Rich Juzwiak of \"Gawker\" ranked \"Loverboy\" as the eighteenth best single of Carey's career. In 2014 article for \"MySpace\", Steven J. Horowitz praised a remix version of \"Loverboy\", which was included to \"Glitter\" tracklist: \"Mariah invoked the ‘80s and relatively played the background to satiating verses from hot-right-nows and longtime friends.\". He placed this version on the 11th place of Carey's all remixes rating, while Mark Graham of \"VH1\" ordered this remix as the thirtieth best song of her catalog.\n\nIn November 2018, the album became the subject of a campaign by Carey fans as part of the build-up to her fifteenth studio album, \"Caution\". Promoted on social media with the hashtag , the campaign resulted in the album reaching number one on the iTunes albums charts in several countries including the United States, and top 10 in several countries worldwide. Carey herself acknowledged and praised the campaign through social media and interviews. She eventually added a medley of songs from the album on her Caution World Tour, as a thank you to her fans.\n\nNotes\n\n\nCredits for \"Glitter\" adapted from AllMusic.\n\n"}

Ampoules are made of glass.\n\nModern ampoules are most commonly used to contain pharmaceuticals and chemicals that must be protected from air and contaminants. They are hermetically sealed by melting the thin top with an open flame, and usually opened by snapping off the neck. The space above the chemical may be filled with an inert gas before sealing. The walls of glass ampoules are usually sufficiently strong to be brought into a glovebox without any difficulty.\n\nGlass ampoules are more expensive than bottles and other simple containers, but there are many situations where their superior imperviousness to gases and liquids and all-glass interior surface are worth the extra cost. Examples of chemicals sold in ampoules are injectable pharmaceuticals, air-sensitive reagents like tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), hygroscopic materials like deuterated solvents and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and analytical standards.\n\nAmpoules can be pressurised, have air evacuated from them, and have the air in the ampoule replaced with other gasses, often inert ones. The radio-pharmaceutical Xenon-133 often is packaged in glass ampoules and specially-shaped glass ampoules have long been used for samples of gaseous elements, such as all of the Column 18 Noble Gasses save radon (mainly because it is radioactive with a half life less than half a week) and special thick-walled quartz and fluorite ampoules under high pressure containing fluorine and chlorine liquified by the high pressure \n\nTeflon ampoules have been developed, based on the concept of the Teflon jug for high-molarity hydrofluoric acid, for containing chemicals that would corrode and/or ignite glass and/or contaminate themselves, corrode, or disintegrate metal containers where the reagent does not passivate the metal by rapidly forming a layer of a new inert compound on the metal surface reliably and predictably or at all. \n\nPhotosensitive chemicals like many 14-dihydromorphinone opioids like hydromorphone and oxymorphone, various silver salts and so on can be packaged in ampoules of smoked glass, glass with chemicals added in manufacturing that filter out ultraviolet and other types of light, or be made with an opaque top and bottom (usually painted with opaque paint) and the rest of the ampoule wrapped in thick paper.\n\nHistorically, ampoules were used to contain a small sample of a person's blood after death, which was entombed alongside them in many Christian catacombs. It was originally believed that only martyrs were given this burial treatment, though it is suspected to have been a widely practiced tradition.\n\nAn ampoule, allegedly dating back to the year 305 and filled with the blood of Saint Januarius (\"San Gennaro\"), bishop of Benevento, has been kept for centuries in the Cathedral at Naples. Every year on 19 September the town celebrates the Feast of San Gennaro, when the solid reddish-brown contents of the ampoule usually liquifies after being taken out of a safe, carried in procession and placed on the Cathedral's altar.\n\nAnother well-known ampoule is the Holy Ampulla (\"Sainte Ampoule\") which held the anointing oil for the coronation of the French monarchs. The oil was allegedly passed down from the time of Clovis I; it was kept for a time in the tomb of Saint Remigius and later in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims. It was used in coronation of Charles X.\n\nModern glass ampoules are produced industrially from short lengths of glass tubing, shaped by heating with gas torches and gravity in automated production lines. Computer vision techniques are usually employed for quality control.\n\nAmpoules often have colored rings of paint or enamel around their necks that are meant to identify the substance inside the ampoule. The rings are machine-readable and allow for accurate handling of the substance for the purposes of storage, labeling, and secondary packaging.\n\nColor coding of modern ampoules is done during the manufacturing process. A machine applies colored rings on the ampoule between the two ovens. \n\nThe filling and sealing of ampoules may be done by automated machinery on an industrial scale, or by hand in small-scale industries and laboratory. Ampoule filling machines can be categorized in three categories called automatic machine, semi automatic machine and manual (hand-operated) machines.\n\nBlank ampoules can be purchased from scientific glass supply houses and sealed with a small gas torch. \n\nA Schlenk line may be used for sealing under inert atmospheres. There is procedure of purging nitrogen before and after filling liquid into ampoules in order to remove atmospheric air available inside the ampoules. \n\nAmpoules are opened by scoring the neck and snapping the top off. In the \"one point cut\" (OPC ampoules) a dot above the neck identifies the location of a small cut in the glass to help breaking/opening the ampoule.\n\nIf properly done, this last operation creates a clean break without any extra glass shards or slivers; but the liquid or solution may be filtered for greater assurance. \n\nGlass particle contamination is of ongoing concern, with patients who receive medication parenterally, such as intravenously under hospital care, at greater risk of receiving glass particulates when medication is aspirated. A 2016 study of 180 ampoules found 19,473 glass particles in aspirated fluids, with filtering only reducing the mean from 114 to 89 particles per ampoule. Glass particle contamination of an ampule occurred with all intravenous injection methods.\n\nAmpoules are common practice as containers of low frequency RFID tags. These are used mainly for tagging animals, such as dogs, for identification.\n\n\n"}

It was the second Hanna-Barbera feature, after \"Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!\" (1964). The film is a theatrical spin-off of the 1960-66 television series, \"The Flintstones\", and is a swan song (series finale) of the show, made immediately following the end of production on the series. The working title of the film was \"That Man Flintstone\", with the film poster featuring Fred Flintstone in the same pose of the Bob Peak poster for \"Our Man Flint\". The film is a parody of the James Bond films.\n\nThis film was the first feature film voice role for Betty Rubble's voice actress Gerry Johnson. Additionally, it marked the first voice work of Henry Corden, who supplied Fred's singing voice, and would go on to fully assume the role of Fred after Alan Reed's death in 1977. While the film includes numerous musical interludes, including one song performed by Louis Prima, the theme song from the show itself is not used.\n\nIn the opening scene, secret agent Rock Slag, who is physically identical to Fred Flintstone, is being chased through Bedrock. His pursuers, Ali and Bobo, think that they have finally killed him when they push him off a building. Meanwhile, the Flintstones and Rubbles prepare for a camping vacation which includes trying to drop Dino and Hoppy off at the veterinarian. On the way back, Fred crashes Barney's car, and they make a stop at the hospital where Rock Slag is also recovering. After Ali and Bobo find Rock and put him out of commission, Chief Boulder of the Secret Service enlists Fred to take his place in Paris for a special meeting. His assignment is to meet Tanya, the #1 female lieutenant of master criminal the Green Goose, who has agreed to turn over the Green Goose in return for a chance to meet the irresistible Rock Slag. Rock is not sure that this is such a good idea but the Chief reassures him that he will keep an eye on Fred.\n\nThinking that the Green Goose is an actual bird, Fred tells his family that their vacation has become an all-expense-paid trip to Eurock. Barney and Fred return all the camping gear and use the money to buy the Rubbles tickets to go along. Meanwhile, Ali and Bobo make several attempts on Fred's life assuming that he is Rock Slag. Once in Paris, the Chief tells Fred that he must now go to Rome instead, with the help of master of disguise Triple X. Fred makes attempts to sneak away from Wilma to meet with Tanya, but ends up spending the night trying to escape all of Rock's female admirers. After missing a date with Wilma, Fred buys her a \"genuine imitation diamond necklace\" from a street hustler to make it up to her, but finds that she slept soundly through the night without even realizing that he was missing.\n\nDiscovering the Chief's secret office, Fred tries to back out of his assignment but after finding out what the Green Goose really is, he has pangs of guilt over Pebbles' future and makes an excuse to get away and meet Tanya at a restaurant. Unfortunately, Wilma and the Rubbles go to the same restaurant and catch them together - thinking that Fred is having an affair. Rock actually shows up to replace Fred, but gets mistakenly pounded by an angry Wilma, Betty and Barney and ends up out of commission again. Tanya then leads Fred to the Green Goose (whose hideout is at an abandoned amusement park), but he is unaware that the Chief has been taken out by Ali and Bobo, so he has no back-up. Barney, meanwhile, has followed Fred to see what this is all about, and they both end up captured by the Green Goose. Barney is tortured in an effort to get Fred, who is believed to be Rock, to give him secret information. Fred refuses to talk, despite Barney's torture.\n\nThe Green Goose, who is revealed to be Triple X, makes plans to launch his deadly inter-rockinental missile, which is disguised as the park's space ride.

{"id": "2031887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031887", "title": "Laxmikant–Pyarelal", "text": "Laxmikant–Pyarelal\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal are a popular and successful Indian composer duo, consisting of Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar (1937–1998) and Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma (1940- ). They are considered among the most successful composers in Hindi film history and composed music for about 750 Hindi movies from 1963 to 1998, working for almost all notable filmmakers, including Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, B.R. Chopra, Shakti Samanta, Manmohan Desai, Yash Chopra, Boney Kapoor, J. Om Prakash, Raj Khosla, L V Prasad, Subhash Ghai, K Viswanath and Manoj Kumar.\n\nLaxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar was born on the day of Laxmi Pujan, Dipawali on 3 November 1937. Probably, because of the day of his birth, his parents named him Laxmikant, after the goddess Laxmi. He spent his childhood amidst dire poverty in the slums of Vile Parle (East) in Mumbai. His father died when he was a child. Because of the poor financial condition of the family he could not complete his academic education either. Laxmikant's father's friend, a musician himself, advised Laxmikant and his elder brother to learn music. Accordingly, Laxmikant learned to play the mandolin and his elder brother learned to play the tabla. He spent two years in the company of the well-known mandolin player Hussain Ali. He began organising and performing in Indian Classical instrumental music concerts to earn some money. Later, in the 1940s, he also learned mandolin from Bal Mukund Indorker and violin from Husnalal (of the Husanlal Bhagatram fame). Laxmikant began his film career as a child actor in the films \"Bhakt Pundalik (1949 film)\" and \"Aankhen (1950 film)\". He also acted in some Gujarati films.\n\nPyarelal Ramprasad Sharma (born 3 September 1940) is the son of a renowned trumpeter Pandit Ramprasad Sharma (popularly known as \"Babaji\"), who taught him the basics of music. He started learning violin at the age of 8 and practised it 8 to 12 hours daily. He learnt to play violin from a Goan musician named Anthony Gonsalves. The song \"My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves\" from the movie \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" is regarded as a tribute to Mr. Gonsalves (the movie had music by Laxmikant–Pyarelal). By the age of 12, his family's financial condition had deteriorated, which in turn forced him to earn money by playing in studios. Pyarelal then used to frequent and play the violin in studios such as Ranjit Studios, to earn money for his family. Pyarelal's real life brother Gorakh Sharma played guitar for various songs composed by the duo Lakshmikant Pyarelal.\n\nIn an interview with Annu Kapoor recently, he has mentioned that he was quite an adept violinist and expert in western form of music. Pyarelal even thought to try his fortune in the West and wanted to become a regular orchestra player with a renowned group. Lakshmikant dissuaded him and then they started the amazing journey of music for Indian cinema.\n\nWhen Laxmikant was about 10 years old, he once played mandolin in a Lata Mangeshkar concert in Radio Club, Colaba. Lata was so impressed that she talked to him after the concert.\n\nLaxmikant and Pyarelal met at \"Sureel Kala Kendra\", a music academy for children, run by the Mangeshkar family. After she came to know about their financially poor backgrounds, Lata recommended their names to music directors like Naushad, Sachin Dev Burman and C. Ramchandra. Similar financial backgrounds and age made Laxmikant and Pyarelal very good friends. They used to spend long hours at the recording studios, sometimes getting work for each other and even playing together whenever they got the opportunity.\n\nPyarelal often used to frequent the Bombay Chamber Orchestra and the Paranjoti Academy, where he would perfect his skills in the company of Goody Seervai, Coomi Wadia, Mehli Mehta and his son, Zubin Mehta. Laxmikant–Pyarelal were not content with the payments being made to them for their music, so they decided to go to Madras (now Chennai). But, it was the same story there. So, they returned. Once Pyarelal decided to leave India and go to Vienna to play for symphony orchestras, just like Zubin. However, he stayed back at Laxmikant's insistence. Some of Laxmikant–Pyarelal's colleagues at this time included Pandit Shivkumar Sharma (Santoor) and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia (flute). Later, Shivkumar and Hariprasad also ventured into Hindi Cinema as Shiv-Hari.\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal worked with almost all well-reputed music directors (with the exception of O. P. Nayyar and Shankar-Jaikishan though Laxmikant used to play mandolin in Shankar Jaikishan songs) of the 1950s. In 1953, they became assistants to Kalyanji-Anandji and worked with them as assistants till 1963. They worked as music arrangers for many music directors including Sachin Dev Burman (in \"Ziddi\") and also for his son Rahul Dev Burman (in his first film \"Chhote Nawab\"). Laxmikant–Pyarelal and R D Burman remained very good friends, even when Laxmikant–Pyarelal started giving music independently. R D Burman played mouth organ for the two of songs of \"Dosti\". Laxmikant once made a guest appearance playing himself as a composer of the Song \"Dil Ki Baat\" in \"Teri Kasam\" (1982), which had music by R D Burman.\n\nIn their early days, Laxmikant–Pyarelal's music was very similar to Shankar-Jaikishan's music, as Laxmikant was a great fan of theirs. Once Shankar even changed his orchestration to make sure that his music did not sound like Laxmikant–Pyarelal's. Laxmikant–Pyarelal's first film as music directors was not released. The first released movie which featured them as music directors was Babubhai Mistry's \"Parasmani\" (1963), which was a costume drama. All the songs of the film became immensely popular, esp. \"Hasata Hua Nurani Chehara\", \"Wo Jab Yaad Aaye\" and \"Mere Dil Main Halki Si\". Throughout their tenure as music directors, Laxmikant–Pyarelal only used A-grade singers. Their mentors, Mohammad Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar agreed to sing for them in spite of low budgets, and Laxmikant–Pyarelal always remained indebted to them. In fact, all three, Mohammad Rafi, Asha Bhosle and Lata have sung the highest number of songs in their career for Laxmikant–Pyarelal. They continued to give patronage to Mohammed Rafi, sometimes against filmmakers' wishes. They had a great rapport with Kishore Kumar as well. Kishore Kumar sang the most songs (402) for L-P among all male singers, followed by Rafi (about 388 songs).\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal hit the big time with Rajshri Productions' 1964 film \"Dosti\". The film had two newcomer heroes who never became popular, and the film was a success due to its music. Songs like \"Chahoonga main tujhe shaam savere\" and \"Rahi manava\" became very popular. At that time, many used to think that there was a single person by the name of \"Laxmikant Pyarelal\". Laxmikant–Pyarelal won their first Filmfare Best Music Director Award for the movie, ahead of stalwarts like Shankar-Jaikishan (for \"Sangam\") and Madan Mohan (for \"Woh Kaun Thi?\"). Then came \"Lootera\", a superhit musical non-star cast film, which is remembered only because of Lata Manageshkar's superhit songs with Laxmikant–Pyarelal.\n\nIn 1967, L-P consolidated their position in the Hindi film industry with a series of hits, one after another. Non star cast film \"Farz\" was L-P's first golden jubilee musical hit, followed by big star cast films such as \"Anita\", \"Shagird\", yet another Golden Jubilee hit, \"Patthar Ke Sanam\", \"Night in London\", \"Jaal\" and another evergreen musical hit \"Milan\". L-P received their second Filmfare Trophy for \"Milan\" without any stiff competition.\n\nThe rise of Laxmikant–Pyarelal, Rahul Dev Burman, and Kalyanji-Anandji marked the end of an old era of Bollywood music, which had belonged to Jaidev, Shankar-Jaikishan, Sachin Dev Burman, Naushad, C. Ramchandra, Khayyam, Madan Mohan, O. P. Nayyar, Roshan and others. Big film producing names, such as Prasad Productions, Rajshri Productions, J. Om Prakash, Raj Khosla, Manoj Kumar, Ramanand Sagar, Madan Mohla, Mohan Sahagal, V.Shantaram, Raj Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai and many more, started replacing their regular music directors and preferred Laxmikant–Pyarelal on a regular basis, and in return L-P have given outstanding music to justify the replacement among the big names.\n\nOne of the most important associations that the duo developed was with lyricist Anand Bakshi. The team of Laxmikant–Pyarelal and lyricist Anand Bakshi churned out some of the most popular songs in Hindi Cinemas history. The combo composed songs for more than 250 movies. Anand Bakshi was the lyricist who wrote the maximum number of texts Laxmikant–Pyarelal gave music to. He was actually the lyricist for all the films for which Laxmikant–Pyarelal won Filmfare Awards, except their very first award.\n\nActor Rajesh Khanna kept Lakshmikant Pyarelal as music director for 26 of his films.\n\nAnother great collaboration was with Asha Bhonsle. She has sung many hits under their baton. \"Dhal Gaya Din\" (with Rafi) in \"Humjoli\" (1970) became a superhit. \"Roz Roz Rozy\" from \"Khilona\" (1970), \"Bane Bade Raja\" from \"Abhinetri\" (1970), \"Hungama Ho Gaya\" and \"Balma Hamar Motorcar Leke Aayo\" from \"Anhonee \" (1974), \"Aye Mere Nanhe Gulfam\" from \"Jagriti\" (1977), \"Aaiye Shauk Se Kahiye\" from \"Parvarish\" (1977), \"Teri Rab Ne\" from \"Suhaag\" (1979), \"Ek Hasina Thi\" from \"Karz\" (1980), \"Are Bhaago Are Dauro\" from \"Bandish\" (1980), \"Man Kyun Behka Re\" from \"Utsav\" (1985), \"Balram Ne Bahut Samjhaya\" from \"Ram Balram\" (1990) etc. They recorded the second most songs with Asha Bhosle. In the years 1980–1986, most of their songs would be sung by Asha only. \"Hungama Ho Gaya\" from \"Anhonee\" was a chartbuster and Asha was nominated for Filmfare Award in 1974. The song was later re-recorded for the 2014 film \"Queen\", with additional voice by Arijit Singh, it again hit the top charts and became a superhit. \"Man Kyun Behka Re\" with Lata was also a hit and several blockbusters by L-P had Asha as lead voice in films such as \"Suhaag\", \"Vakil Babu\", \"Dostana\", \"Adha Din Adhi Raat\", \"Loha\" and \"Anhonee\" etc. to name a few.\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal composed Indian classical music as well as Western music; they were most popular for their folk tunes and semi-classical music. For \"Shagird\", they wrote Rock-n-Roll-style melodies, and in \"Karz\" the music is closer to disco. For this film they wrote a Westernised version of a Ghazal, \"Dard-e-dil Dard-e- jigar\", and they received the Filmfare Best Music Director Award for the year.\n\nLP dominated the Weekly Hindi Film songs Countdown programme Binaca Geet Mala, the most popular musical radio programme of its time. Its first broadcast was in 1953 by Radio Ceylon and its host was the Ameen Sayani. The Binaca Geet Mala ranked the most popular Bollywood film songs according to sales in select shops in select cities.\n\nIn the third quarter of 1963, L-P's first ever song \"Hasta Hua Nurani Chehara\" from \"Parasmani\" hit the \"Binaca Geet Mala\". After that, L-P's songs were regularly and prominently aired on \"Binaca Geet Mala\". There used to be sixteen songs in each of the weekly \"Binaca Geet Mala\" programme, more than half the numbers of the songs were of L-P. There are certain weekly Binaca Geet Mala programmes in which more than 13 out of 16 songs of LP were broadcast when LP were right on top of their career. BGM used to broadcast annual (Vasrshik) programme giving the orders of the top 32 songs of every year. In this programme also, L-P had the upper hand. Not only that, on average, there used to be at least 15 songs from L-P, also about 50% of the songs between top to tenth position. Laxmikant–Pyarelal have 245 numbers of Binca Geetmala Final Songs...(The songs compiled at the end of every year, to measure the popularity)..The highest numbers of the songs by any music directors appeared in Binaca Geetmala Finals. Apart from Laxmikant–Pyarelal have the highest numbers of the TOP songs for 11 years. The Binaca Geet Mala records show that Laxmikant–Pyarelal have completely dominated this musical programme.\n\nIn all, 174 songs of L-P appeared in Binaca Geet Mala finals.\n\nLata Mangeshkar played a major role in shaping up the careers of Laxmikant–Pyarelal. She sang the highest number of songs for them. Lata Mangeshkar sounds extremely melodious under Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Lata Mangeshkar and Laxmikant–Pyarelal shared a long, close and rewarding association. From 1963, through the next 35 years, Lata Mangeshkar and Laxmikant–Pyarelal were to chalk up around 712 songs together, the highest numbers of the song sung by Lata Mangeshkar under any music directors, which accounted for one in every 10 Hindi film songs recorded by the Melody Queen, and one of every four songs composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Their work includes variety and range; there were chart-slammers and classics, and \"chaalu\" numbers as well as connoisseur choices. Laxmikant–Pyarelal dominates Lata's voice in \n\"Sati Savitri\" (1964), \"Lootera\" (1965), \"Intaquam\" (1968), \"Sharafat\" (1970), \"Abhinetri\" (1971), \"Mera Gaon Mera Desh\" (1971), \"Jal Bin Machhali Nritya Bin Bijle\" (1971), \"Raja Jani\" (1972), \"Bobby\" (1973), \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" and \"Ek Duje Ke Liye\" (1981)... all have different style.\n\nAsha Bhosle recorded almost 494 songs for Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Their collaboration lasted almost 35 years, 1963–1998. They gave Asha hits after hits. They made Asha Bhosle the numero uno singer of the 1970s with chart toppers like \"Hungama Ho Gaya\", \"Dhal Gaya Din\", \"Koi Shahari Babu', \"Ek Haseena Thi\" etc.\n\nSinger Mohammad Rafi has sung as many as 379 songs under Laxmikant-Pyarelal. This is the highest number of songs sung by Mohammad Rafi with any of the music directors in Hindi film music. Songs from \"Dosti\", \"Aaye Din Bahar Ke\", \"Aaya Sawan Jhum Ke\", \"Mere Humdam Mere Dost\", \"Jeene Ki Raah\", \"Dharam Veer\", \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" and \"Sargam\" etc. have the dominance of Rafi. Mohammad Rafi played a very important role in the Music Duo's career. Laxmikant–Pyarelal started their career with a song of Rafi in the film Parasmani (1963). Rafi Sahab sang for L-P for free and blessed them that- \"This music Duo may work together to their last breath\" Therefore, Laxmikant–Pyarelal always respected Rafi till the end and Rafi sang his last song- \"Tere Aane Ki Aas Hai Dost...\" under direction of L-P, which was recorded on 31 July 1980 in Mahboob studio at 10:00 PM. Shortly afterwards Mohd Rafi died at 10:25 PM.\n\nLaxmikant-Pyarelal also produced some memorable songs rendered by Kishore Kumar, 402 songs, the second highest numbers of songs sung by Kishore Kumar under any of the music directors in Hindi film. Namely \"Mere Mehboob Quayamat hogi\", \"Pyar Batate Chalo\", Mere Naseeb Main\", \"Ye Dard Bhara Afsana\", Vaada Tera Vaada\", \"Ye Jeevan Hai\", \"Mere Dil Main Aaj Kya Hai\", \"mere Diwane Pan Ki\", \"My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves\", \"Aap Ke Anurodh Pe\", \"Ik Ritu Aaye\", \"Gadi bula rahi hai\", \"Ruk jana Nahi\", \"Om Shanti Om\" and many more hits.\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal kept a balancing act between Mohammad Rafi (379 songs) and Kishore Kumar (402 songs). During the peak wave of Kishore Kumar after Aaradhana, it is Laxmikant–Pyarelal who gave highest numbers of songs to Mohammad Rafi.. In 1977 L-P brought back the glory of Mohammad Rafi through \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" and \"Sargam\"..\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal also worked with Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Amit Kumar, Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan, Shailender Singh, P.Susheela, S.P.Balasubrahmanyam, S.Janaki and Anuradha Paudwal. However, they also gave big breaks to many newcomers such as Kavita Krishnamurthy, Mohammed Aziz, Suresh Wadkar, Shabbir Kumar, Sukhwinder Singh, Vinod Rathod, and Roop Kumar Rathod. L-P always wanted to engage the voice of Talat Mahmood so they specially composed a very melodious song \"Mohabbat ki Kahaniyan\" in 1971 for the film \"Wo Din Yaad Karo\" in which Lata accompanied Talat Sahab.\n\nOn 7 May 2011, the event house Kakas Entertainment arranged a show called Maestros, by Pyarelal, in which they revived old songs with singers such as, Anuradha Paudwal, Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sudesh Bhosle and many other Bollywood singers.\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal are the only composers who assembled the legendary singers Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar together, for the song \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar Kya Kare\" in \"Amar Akbar Anthony\".\n\nAfter Laxmikant's death, Pyarelal has done some work independently. Yet, Pyarelal always used the name 'Laxmikant-Pyarelal' for all the future compositions. When the playback singer Kumar Sanu turned music director, he approached Pyarelal to arrange music for him. Pyarelal was approached to assist in the music of Farah Khan's \"Om Shanti Om\" song \"Dhoom Tana\". In 2009 Pyarelal won the Sachin Dev Burman International Award for Creative Sound and Music at the Pune Film Festival. Pyarelal has done a show with Kakas Entertainment called Maestros: A musical Journey of Laxmikant–Pyarelal.\n\nAfter Laxmikant–Pyarelalji made their debut as a music director duo in 1963, they were nominated for the Filmfare Awards (Best Music Director) almost every year. Many times, they were nominated for three or more films in a particular year. At the same time L-P narrowly missed the awards for musical hits like \"Aaye Din Bahar Ke\", \"Intaqam\", \"Do Raaste\", \"Mera Gaon Mera Desh\", \"Shor\", \"Daag\", \"Bobby\", \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", \"Utsav\", \"Sur Sangam\", \"Farz\", \"Shagird\", \"Tezaab\", \"Hero\" and \"Mr. India\".\n\nLaxmikant–Pyarelal have won seven Filmfare Awards.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2031890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031890", "title": "Macrotyloma geocarpum", "text": "Macrotyloma geocarpum\n\nMacrotyloma geocarpum is also known as the ground bean, geocarpa groundnut, Hausa groundnut, or Kersting's groundnut. In French, it is often called \"la lentille de terre\". \"M. geocarpum\" is an herbaceous annual plant and a crop of minor economic importance in sub-Saharan Africa, tolerant of drought, with a growth habit similar to that of the peanut.\n\"M. geocarpum\" is a pulse belonging to the legume family. It is primarily produced in western Africa, specifically in Benin and surrounding regions. It can provide nutrition, income, and the ability to alleviate hunger given the further production and enhancement of current practices.\n\nYields reach in dry seed.\n\nFollowing the construction of the Nigerian railway system, which extended from Lagos in 1896 to Ibadan in 1900 and Kano in 1911, the Hausa of northern Nigeria became major producers of groundnuts. They surprised the British, who had expected the Hausa to turn to cotton production. However, the Hausa had sufficient agricultural expertise to realize cotton required more labor and the European prices offered for groundnuts were more attractive than those for cotton. \"Within two years, the peasant farmers of Hausaland were producing so many tonnes of groundnuts that the railway was unable to cope with the traffic. As a result, the European merchants in Kano had to stockpile sacks of groundnuts in the streets.\" This is a great example of the African initiative taken by peasant producers to adapt to a cash economy. It is not clear, however, whether the \"Hausa groundnut\", \"M. geocarpum\", was the groundnut being produced in such significant numbers, as peanuts and Bambara groundnuts are also grown in the region.\n\n\"M. geocarpum\" is noted for relatively low yields, but high protein content and desirable flavour. Per 100g of dried seed, it consists of 9.7 g of water, 348 kcal, 19.4 g protein, 1.1 g fat, 66.6 g carbohydrates, 5.5 g fibre, 103 mg calcium, 392 mg phosphorus, 15 mg iron, 0.76 mg thiamin, 0.19 mg riboflavin, and 2.3 mg niacin. Leaves can also be eaten.\n\nBenin is located in the savanna of Africa which has weather conditions that are fairly humid in the south while being semiarid in the north . It offers growing conditions for a variety of crops that can be intercropped in the differing seasons, known as the dry season and rainy season, as well as having differing climate between the north and south. Southern climate is primarily stable, maintaining temperatures between 27 and 32 °C in the warmest season and 22 to 25 °C during the colder season. In the north, temperatures fluctuate between 27 and 32 °C in the dry season and 25 to 27 °C during the lowest season.\n\nMergeai notes that cultivated forms of Kersting's groundnut are known, but not commonly grown, in coastal African nations from Senegal to Nigeria. Tamini records the declining cultivation of Kersting's groundnut in the south west of Burkina Faso.\n\nThe geocarpa groundnut pod develops in the ground in pods in regions in Benin under the previously noted climate conditions. The growing conditions that allow for the success of the groundnut are seen in several countries across Africa in the savanna.\n\nWhile the groundnut provides nutrition and the potential to alleviate hunger in Africa, it also offers potential to reduce poverty by contributing economically to small-scale farmers. In Benin in 2012, a kilogram of the geocarpa groundnut could sell for $2–$4 - roughly three to five times the price of rice, and selling up to 30 bags a day produces noteworthy incomes. Specifically, incomes average $1000 a month for this product alone. Considering that this crop is being produced on an average of 0.48 ha of land, the underuse is evident. Increasing the area of farming land for this crop would be extremely beneficial to both producers and consumers, as it would allow for a greater generation of the crop and enhance the availability to the greater population. With the generation of $1000 monthly incomes, the possibilities that the geocarpa groundnut offer to the economies of small-scale farming in Benin and other regions is promising.\n\n\"M geocarpum\" crops have been decreasing in production for years. The reduction is causing the adoption to halt, as farmers in regions new to the crop are unwilling to take chances with crops not seen to be a feasible option. With proper implementation and production practices, these constraints can be lifted. One problem is that it is viewed as crop for elders to farm; a reduction in plantation has been occurring and will continue to decrease unless wider adoption is met. \nFurther education in agriculture practices could alleviate this issue.\n\nRusts and mildews can be problematic diseases for this crop in the more humid parts of its range.\n\n\"M. geocarpum\" is indigenous to west Africa, but is not widely grown there, and shows low levels of morphological variation. The need to maintain genetic diversity and food security by continuing to grow this crop throughout its historical range may be more important than promoting its adoption in new regions. It is most widely grown where markets for it exist and where a history of religious and cultural significance for the crop is known.\n\nAlthough variation in regions may be present, Benin is host to a very female-empowered agriculture enterprise. Holding the main role in marketplace interactions, women have an important role in both the production and sale of their products. In southern Benin, where primary production occurs, both men and women contribute. In the north, however, operations run by primarily females are dominant. \nWomen contribute to the production of many underused crop species in Benin more than their counterparts, and the increase in production could enhance the position and empowerment of women in Africa.\n\nThe geocarpa groundnut can be rotated with other species, thus reducing the risk of health degradation to soils. Producing as much as possible without degrading soil quality is as important as the crop itself, but with proper implementation the production can carry on to harvests that will bring upon wealth, both in the economical and health sides of the matter.\n\n"}

His father came from French (Alsatian) nobility, and his mother was from a German Jewish family, which had converted to Catholicism. Zeyer learned the Czech language from his nanny. He was expected to take over the family's factory but instead decided to learn carpentering. Attempts to study high school and university were unsuccessful. During his life he frequently traveled in Europe and the Orient. After 1877 he moved to Vodňany, where he spent over a decade with literary work. Afterwards, he returned to Prague. He died in Prague.\n\nZeyer's prose and poems are restless, nostalgic, mystical, depressive, and usually end tragically. He often blended foreign legends with national themes particular to Czech society and history. Like the Decadents, his work often combines religious and erotic imagery. He was associated with the \"Lumír\" school, a group of writers that grouped around the magazine of the same name and took their influences from Western Europe, in particular France.\n\nZeyer's epic poems, including \"Vyšehrad\" (1880), \"Šárka\" or \"Karolinská epopej\" (1896), draw from Czech and French legends respectively, and celebrate the glorious past of ancients, compared to the bleak present. He took inspiration from the Czech, Russian, Irish, French history and Scandinavian myths. His novels describe persons trying to live a better life under the romantic ideals and people who find peace only at the moment of death. His semi-autobiographical novel \"Jan Maria Plojhar\" (1891) deals with the tragic nature of an artist. Zeyer's dramatic works were written in a similar style. His work “Tři legendy o krucifixu” (1895) uses the story of Christ's crucifixion to explore themes of Czech Nationalism and the value of art. The first story, “Inultus” follows the story of an Italian sculptress who attempts to create a realistic depiction of the crucifixion. The idea of an artist driven mad by their work is explored in the story and leads to the death of her model, a Czech vagabond named Inultus, whom she murders in a fit of creative insanity.\n\nJosef Suk composed his \"Pohádka\" (Fairy Tale) on the play \"Radúz a Mahulen\" by Zeyer. Composer Leoš Janáček used his theater play about a Slavonic heroine \"Šárka\" as a libretto for his opera.\n\n"}

{"id": "2031916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031916", "title": "Thomas Natural Shorthand", "text": "Thomas Natural Shorthand\n\nThomas Natural Shorthand is an English shorthand system created by Charles A. Thomas which was first published in 1935. Thomas described his system as \"designed to meet the existing need for a simple, legible shorthand that is based on already familiar writing lines, and that is written with a minimum number of rules.\" The system has fallen into disuse with the decline of pen shorthand in the later 20th century, but the spirit of the system lives on in Teeline shorthand, with which it shares a number of characteristics (although the symbols used in each system are quite different).\n\nLike Gregg shorthand, and unlike the older Pitman shorthand, Thomas Natural Shorthand is a \"light-line system\", i.e. a system which does not employ \"shading\" (light and heavy strokes) to distinguish symbols. Unlike earlier light-line systems such as Pernin phonography (which was based on the Duployan system), cursive rather than angular strokes are employed. However, Thomas Natural differs from Gregg and resembles Pitman in its use of \"positional writing\"—vowels are deduced according to whether a form is written on, above, or below the line of writing.\n\nThe system aims to be simpler to learn than competing symbol shorthand systems of the time, boasting \"only twelve word signs and one abbreviating principle\". Total mastery of the system could therefore be achieved much quicker than the major court-reporting systems, and although this simplicity did come with a loss of speed, the speeds achieved were still adequate for secretarial use.\n\nThe system's failure to achieve popularity came from its \"jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none\" position. Those looking for an easy to learn system were far more likely to choose alphabetic systems such as Forkner shorthand or Speedwriting; those interested in developing serious shorthand speed were drawn to more established systems with a court reporting track record such as Gregg or Pitman. To the untrained eye, Thomas Natural shorthand bears a close resemblance to Gregg shorthand (despite being unrelated); it was necessary to actually undertake a study of the system to learn how much simpler it really was than Gregg.\n\nTeeline shorthand shares largely the same philosophy and approach as Thomas Natural Shorthand; it is however more accessible to beginners since the symbols used are themselves based on the Latin alphabet (although so abstractly that most would consider Teeline a symbol, rather than alphabetic, system). The Thomas Natural symbols, on the other hand, were chosen for speed rather than familiarity. Furthermore, Thomas Natural was published in the 1930s-1940s, at a time when alphabetic systems were just beginning their ascendency, whereas in the contemporary era in which Teeline is being promoted, the limitations of the alphabetic systems have made them less attractive than formerly, when their potential seemed greater.\n"}

This colorless liquid is the precursor to polyvinyl acetate, an important industrial polymer.\n\nThe worldwide production capacity of vinyl acetate was estimated at 6,969,000 tonnes/year in 2007, with most capacity concentrated in the United States (1,585,000 all in Texas), China (1,261,000), Japan (725,000) and Taiwan (650,000). The average list price for 2008 was $1600/tonne. Celanese is the largest producer (ca 25% of the worldwide capacity), while other significant producers include China Petrochemical Corporation (7%), Chang Chun Group (6%), and LyondellBasell (5%).\n\nIt is a key ingredient in furniture glue.\n\nVinyl acetate is the acetate ester of vinyl alcohol. Since vinyl alcohol is highly unstable (with respect to acetaldehyde), the preparation of vinyl acetate is more complex than the synthesis of other acetate esters. \n\nThe major industrial route involves the reaction of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen in the presence of a palladium catalyst.\n\n<chem> 2 C2H4 + 2 CH3CO2H + O2 -> 2 CH3CO2CHCH2 + 2 H2O</chem>\n\nThe main side reaction is the combustion of organic precursors. \n\nIsotope labeling and kinetics experiments suggest that the mechanism involves PdCHCHOAc-containing intermediates. Beta-hydride elimination would generate vinyl acetate and a palladium hydride, which would be oxidized to give hydroxide.\n\nVinyl acetate was once prepared by hydroesterification. This method involves the gas-phase addition of acetic acid to acetylene in the presence of metal catalysts. By this route, using mercury(II) catalysts, vinyl acetate was first prepared by Fritz Klatte in 1912. Another route to vinyl acetate involves thermal decomposition of ethylidene diacetate:\n\n<chem>(CH3CO2)2CHCH3 -> CH3CO2CHCH2 + CH3CO2H </chem>\n\nIt can be polymerized to give polyvinyl acetate (PVA). With other monomers it can be used to prepare various copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), vinyl acetate-acrylic acid (VA/AA), polyvinyl chloride acetate (PVCA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (Vp/Va Copolymer, used in hair gels). Due to the instability of the radical, attempts to control the polymerization via most 'living/controlled' radical processes have proved problematic. However, RAFT (or more specifically MADIX) polymerization offers a convenient method of controlling the synthesis of PVA by the addition of a xanthate or a dithiocarbamate chain transfer agent.\n\nVinyl acetate undergoes many of the reactions anticipated for an alkene and an ester. Bromine adds to give the dibromide. Hydrogen halides add to give 1-haloethyl acetates, which cannot be generated by other methods because of the non-availability of the corresponding halo-alcohols. Acetic acid adds in the presence of palladium catalysts to give ethylidene diacetate, CHCH(OAc). It undergoes transesterification with a variety of carboxylic acids. The alkene also undergoes Diels-Alder and 2+2 cycloadditions.\n\nVinyl acetate undergoes transesterification, giving access to vinyl ethers:\n\nTests suggest that vinyl acetate is of low toxicity. For rats (oral) LD50 is 2920 mg/kg.\n\nOn January 31, 2009, the Government of Canada's final assessment concluded that exposure to vinyl acetate is not harmful to human health. This decision under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) was based on new information received during the public comment period, as well as more recent information from the risk assessment conducted by the European Union.\n\nIt is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.\n\n\n"}

Just like LPK, the LKCK faction advocated the concept of Natural Albania and military action against the Milošević administration, but contrary to the pacifist policies of the dominant Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and what it perceived as similar tendencies to moderation inside the LPK. After imprisonment of Avni Klinaku by Yugoslavian authorities, Bahri Fazliu would take charge as the leader.

Historically, its support and membership came from Albanian diaspora, especially within Switzerland and Germany, originating mainly from former Yugoslav republics.\n\nThe LPK was formed in the early 1980s, during the turmoil which would bring the Albanian population of Yugoslavia to wider attention. During the 1981 protests in Kosovo, protesters demanded that Kosovo become a republic within the Yugoslav Federation. The movement was crystallized on Feb 17th, 1982, in Switzerland, as a Marxist union of Albanian diaspora organizations with support and sympathy for/from the communist regime of Enver Hoxha, struggling for the rights of Albanians throughout Yugoslavia and unification with Albania, originally named LRSHJ, to be renamed later as PMK.\n\nThe LPK's ideology was left-wing nationalism. Peter Schwarz, while talking about KLA in \"Kosovo and the crisis in the Atlantic Alliance\", (Sep, 1st, 1999), states: \"\"In Germany a ban was in the course of being implemented against the core of the party, the Enver Hoxha-oriented KPM (Kosovo People's Movement)\"\". Robert Elsie states in his \"Historical Dictionary of Kosovo, 2011\" that: \"\"It was initially Marxist-oriented, seeing Kosova's salvation in Albania and thus supporting the regime of Enver Hoxha\"\".\nThe Marxist–Leninist orientation was necessary in order to achieve support from Albania, and was abandoned after fall of communism in Albania.\n\nThe three core organizations that constituted the LPK were the Marxist–Leninist Communist Party of Albanians in Yugoslavia (), the National Liberation Movement of Kosovo and Other Albanian Regions () and the Marxist–Leninist Organization of Kosovo (). The negotiations had started on late November 1981, failing for the first time in Istanbul between Sabri Novosella and Abdullah Prapashtica despite the support of Albanian Ambassador in Turkey. The movement's platform would be based on that of the more moderate PKMLSHJ, shifted aimed for an Albanian Republic within Yugoslavia, while the other two organizations had the goal of unifying Kosovo with Albania.\n\nThere is some controversy regarding the exact identity of the founders of the LPK. One of its founders, Abdullah Prapashtica, has stated that the movement's executive committee included Osman Osmani, Faton Topalli, Sabri Novosella, Jusuf Gërvalla, Bardhosh Gërvalla, Xhafer Durmishi, Kadri Zeka, Hasan Mala, Xhafer Shatri, and Nuhi Sylejmani (joining after the execution of Gërvalla brothers), while others like Emrush Xhemajli give slightly different names and circumstances.\n\nThe LPK remained active throughout Europe and continuously sponsored and supported insurgents, propaganda, and activities inside Yugoslavia, as well as lobbying for the Albanian national cause. Many would be imprisoned or killed by Yugoslav authorities. On 17 January 1982, Jusuf Gërvalla, Kadri Zeka and Bardhosh Gërvalla were executed in Untergruppenbach, West Germany from Yugoslav secret service secret agents. Two other members, Rexhep Mala and Nuhi Berisha died in a shoot-out with Yugoslav police forces in a Prishtina neighbourhood (today \"\"Kodra e Trimave\"\") on 11 January 1984. On November 2, 1989, Afrim Zhitia and Fahri Fazliu would die in a similar shoot-out (from 12:45 till around 19:00) after being surrounded by Serbian police in the \"\"Kodra e Diellit\"\" neighborhood of Pristina.\n\nDespite the difficulties, the LPK would diligently continue to be the main representative of the Albanian resistance against Serbian rule until December 1989, when Ibrahim Rugova and other intellectuals in Kosovo founded the Democratic League of Kosovo ().\n\nThe LPK would establish the core of what would become known as the Kosovo Liberation Army, following later with the UÇPMB in Preševo Valley, the National Liberation Army (UÇK) in North Macedonia, as well as the FBKSh of Gafurr Adili. Many members including most of the leadership would actively join the war, including Adem Jashari, Sami Lushtaku, Fatmir Limaj, Fehmi Lladrovci, Ramush Haradinaj, Azem Syla, Adem Grabovci, Jakup Krasniqi, Ali Ahmeti, and Hashim Thaçi.\n\nOn 14-05-1999, most of the LPK membership would support the creation of Democratic Progress of Kosovo (Partia për Progres Demokratik e Kosovës) as a political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army after the war, renamed on 21-05-2000 as Democratic Party of Kosovo () led by Hashim Thaçi. Many others would join other political entities that emerged into Kosovo's political arena, i.e. the Socialist Party of Kosovo (), National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo (), Vetëvendosje, etc. The fraction that did not support these changes continued political activity under the same original name (\"Lëvizja Popullore e Kosovës\").\n\nAt the last legislative elections, 2001, 2004, 2007 the party won 1 out of 120 seats.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, what remained from the LPK merged into Vetëvendosje.\n\n\n"}

The most common Hidden Mickey is a formation of three circles that may be perceived as the silhouette of the head and ears of Mickey Mouse, often referred to by Disney aficionados as a \"Classic Mickey\". Mickeys may be painted, made up of objects (such as rocks, or three plates on a table), or be references such as someone wearing Mickey Mouse Club ears in a painting. Hidden Mickeys can take on many sizes and forms.\n\nHidden Mickeys are slipped into many Disney animated films as Easter eggs. They are also hidden in architecture and attractions in Disney parks and resorts, and in studio buildings and many other Disney-related features.\n\nThe first published sighting of a Hidden Mickey was made by Arlen Miller, who wrote an article on Hidden Mickeys for WDW's \"Eyes and Ears\" (a Cast Member weekly publication) in 1989. The article listed Hidden Mickeys found in the Disney theme parks. Months later the author was contacted by \"Disney News\" for more information, and the resulting article made the news of Hidden Mickeys spread worldwide.\n\nThe history of Hidden Mickeys can be traced back to when the Imagineers were designing Epcot in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Disney Company had decided that EPCOT Center would be a more adult themed park, including selling alcohol. As alcohol and Disney characters were deemed to be an improper combination, it was decided that none of the Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, would ever be seen at EPCOT Center. To some of the Imagineers working on EPCOT Center, this was taken as a challenge. They started including hidden Mickey Mouse profiles into various design elements of that park. As the park began to grow, guest comments led Disney to include the characters in EPCOT Center, but tradition was well-established by that point. Hidden Mickeys (as well as other Disney characters like Minnie Mouse) have become a staple of all theme park designs since. Because of the popularity of Hidden Mickeys, Imagineers are encouraged to place them in new construction even to this day.\n\nThroughout the years, Hidden Mickeys spread in popularity as a pop culture phenomenon to the point of recognition.\n\nThey are also well-known to appear on animated movies as well.\n\nAs part of the Happiest Homecoming on Earth at Disneyland, the park had been decorated with 50 hidden Mickey 50 Ears, the official symbol of the 50th anniversary of Disneyland. The symbol is the traditional Mickey face and ears, but with a number 50 in the center. Before the 50th anniversary of Disneyland ended on September 30, 2006, the Hidden 50 Mickeys were gradually removed.\n\nCommon locations for deliberate Hidden Mickeys include the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, where they are most commonly found in attractions, stores, and decor around the environment. Although approximately 1,000 Hidden Mickeys have been recorded, The Walt Disney Company has never compiled a complete list of all the \"known\" or \"deliberate\" Mickeys (whether created by an Imagineer or a Disney Cast Member), so there is no way to confirm or disprove any reported Mickey sightings.\nIn the \"George Lopez\" episode \"George Goes to Disneyland\" there was a contest to see how many Hidden Mickeys a viewer could find. The winner won $10,015 and a trip to Disneyland.\n\nThe \"Kingdom Hearts\" series has several Hidden Mickeys throughout different games, with \"Kingdom Hearts III\" placing a larger emphasis on finding them in several different Disney worlds, and are referred to as \"Lucky Emblems\". Finding these Lucky Emblems and taking in-game pictures of them are important, as depending on the difficulty, a certain number are required to unlock the game's secret ending.\n\n\n"}

WCOP-FM's separate programming was initially classical music and was one of the first FM stations in the region to (briefly) broadcast in FM stereo (the station would resume stereo programming in the early 1970s).\n\nIn 1965, WCOP (AM) had become Boston's affiliate for the NBC Radio Network, and WCOP-FM would often simulcast the hourly NBC Radio newscasts. By 1969, NBC Radio's weekend series \"Monitor\" had moved from WCOP to WCOP-FM, to allow the former to broadcast more hours of country music on the weekends.\n\nThe station went through a number of format changes (and later callsign changes), including beautiful music in the late 60s until 1973, oldies (as \"Total Gold 101, WCOP-FM\") from 1973 to 1974), country from 1974 to 1976, album oriented rock (as WTTK, \"TK101\") from 1976 to 1978, beautiful music (as WHUE-FM) from 1979 to 1985, and top 40 (as WKKT, \"The Cat\") for a few months in 1985). In December 1984, while still a beautiful music station, WHUE-FM sought and received the WCOZ call letters formerly on 94.5; the call sign was only used for two weeks prior to becoming WKKT.\n\n100.7 FM adopted its current format and callsign, WZLX, in mid-October 1985. Station owners First Media Corporation hired Gary Guthrie as the architect of its classic hits format, a format aimed at people who experienced adolescence in either the 1960s and 1970s and enjoyed the music of those eras, but did not care for the then-current heavy metal or top 40 'hot hits' of the 1980s. These were people whose mindset was getting too old for AOR and top 40, but were too young for or not interested in oldies. WZLX is considered one of the classic rock format's earliest success stories as reflected by the station's 19th to 2nd place climb in the Adults 25-54 demographic in its first ratings period.\n\nIn 1986, Guthrie spread his concept of the format to other radio stations he consulted and Bill Smith was hired to be the station's program director and morning personality. Guthrie would return in 1990 for an additional on-site stint to repair the station's ratings.\n\nA series of ownership changes made WZLX a part of Cook-Inlet Radio, then Infinity Broadcasting in late 1992. Infinity was renamed CBS Radio in December 2005.\n\nIn 1997, WZLX radio host George Taylor Morris created a media frenzy about the \"Dark Side of the Rainbow\" phenomenon, in which Pink Floyd's album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is said to synch up with the movie \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nIn 2005, WZLX, along with sister stations WBMX and WODS, were rumored to flip to CBS Radio's ever-expanding \"Jack FM\" format. Had WQSX (now WEEI-FM) not flipped to the format as \"93.7 Mike FM\" on April 14, WZLX might have flipped to the format the next day as \"100.7 Jack FM\".\n\nIn the spring of 2007, WZLX became the first station in the country to broadcast programming in full digital 5.1 surround sound. This flagship effort coincides with the recent move of the industry to implement the HD Radio format.\nFrom 1991 to 2007, the station had its studios on the 24th floor of the Prudential Tower in downtown Boston, the location of its transmitter. On March 3, 2007, the station moved crosstown to the facility where sister stations WODS and WBCN are clustered in the CBS studios in Brighton. The transmitter is still atop the Prudential Tower.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom (which locally owned WEEI, WEEI-FM, WKAF, WRKO and WAAF). On October 10, CBS Radio announced that as part of the process of obtaining regulatory approval of the merger, WZLX would be one of sixteen stations that would be divested by Entercom, along with sister stations WBZ and WBZ-FM, as well as WRKO and WKAF (WBMX, WODS, WEEI AM and FM, and WAAF would be retained by Entercom, while WBZ-FM was traded to Beasley Broadcast Group in exchange for WMJX). On November 1, iHeartMedia announced that they would acquire WZLX, WBZ (AM), WRKO, and WKAF. To meet ownership limits set by the FCC, iHeart placed WKOX into the Ocean Stations Trust in preparation for a sale to a permanent buyer. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. iHeart then began operating WZLX, WBZ, and WKAF under a local marketing agreement. The sale of WZLX, WRKO, WKAF, and WBZ to iHeart was completed on December 19, 2017.\n\nThere have been a few morning shows on the station in recent history. With the coming of Howard Stern to WBCN in the early '90s, the Boston legend Charles Laquidara and his show, The Big Mattress, took up residence at 'ZLX. With Charles's retirement, the short-lived \"Mornings with Tai and Steve Sweeney\" eventually gave way to \"Steve Sweeney's Neighborhood\", (co-hosted by Lance Norris) which ended a 5-year run in 2005. Longtime morning team \"Karlson and McKenzie\" took over on August 1, 2005.\n\nBarry Scott and The Lost 45s retro radio show was a Sunday night staple (he was also the Marketing & Promotions Director there from its inception until 1992).\n\nBeginning in October 2013, WZLX carried Boston Celtics games that conflicted with Boston Bruins games. Games were produced by sister station WBZ-FM (which is the flagship for both teams). In addition, some Bruins games conflicting with WBZ-FM's New England Patriots broadcasts aired on WZLX starting in 2011 (previously, WBZ served this function). Celtics and Bruins broadcasts were dropped from WZLX following the sale to iHeartMedia, which separated the station from WBZ-FM (now owned by the Beasley Broadcast Group). As of April 2020, conflicting Bruins games now air on WBOS, while conflicting Celtics games now air on WROR-FM.\n\nWZLX previously aired an all-blues format on its HD2 subchannel called \"Radio Mojo\". On December 19, 2017, WZLX-HD2 began simulcasting sister talk radio station WRKO.\n\nWZLX previously aired a freeform rock format on its HD3 subchannel called WBCN which continued the name of the former Boston AOR station. On January 29, 2016, WZLX-HD3 switched to an adult standards format as \"The Lounge\". After the sale of the station to iHeart was completed on December 19, 2017, the HD3 channel was removed. On early March 2020, the HD3 channel was reopened and is currently simulcasting the K-Love Radio Network under a lease agreement with EMF Broadcasting.\n\n\n"}

He currently serves as a bench coach for the Cleveland Indians. He is the father of retired professional baseball player Beau Mills.\n\nMills was educated at Exeter High School in California, College of the Sequoias, and the University of Arizona, where he was drafted in the 17th round by the Montreal Expos.\n\nMills reached the major leagues in 1980 and went on to post a .256 batting average with one home run and 12 RBI in 106 games played for the Expos (1980–83). He divided his time between Triple-A and the majors in each of those seasons, and sustained a right knee injury that ended his playing career at the age of 29. A full-time left-handed hitter and primarily a third baseman, he also saw time at first base and second. Mills became a part of major league trivia, when in 1983 he was Nolan Ryan's 3,509th career strikeout victim, lifting Ryan past Walter Johnson as the all-time strikeout leader.\n\nMills managed eleven seasons in the minors in the Cubs, Rockies and Dodgers organizations (1987–2002), and also served as an advance scout for the Cubs. Mills was Terry Francona's first-base coach with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1997–2000. In 2003, Mills served as the Montreal Expos bench coach. From 2004 to 2009, Mills was teamed again with Francona when he served as the bench coach for the Boston Red Sox.\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Mills was named manager of the Houston Astros, replacing interim manager Dave Clark.\n\nMills holds the dubious distinction of guiding the Astros to the franchise's first ever 100-loss season, which he did in 2011, the trend continued the following season, as his Astros holding the worst record in the majors, Mills was fired on August 18, 2012 along with hitting coach Mike Barnett and first base coach Bobby Meacham. He was succeeded on an interim basis by Oklahoma City RedHawks manager Tony DeFrancesco. The team would go on to finish the season with 100+ losses for the second consecutive year.\n\nOn October 31, 2012, Mills was hired as the third base coach of the Cleveland Indians, to work with Francona again. Mills was reassigned as the Indians bench coach in 2014. While coaching for the Boston Red Sox under Francona from 2004 to 2009 he was in the same position. On July 11, 2017, Mills managed the American League All-Star team while Francona dealt with a health issue.\n\n, or Retrosheet\n"}

{"id": "2032025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032025", "title": "The Summoner's Tale", "text": "The Summoner's Tale\n\n\"The Summoner's Tale\" is one of \"The Canterbury Tales\" by Geoffrey Chaucer.\n\nThe tale is a fierce counterpunch to the preceding tale by The Friar, who had delivered an attack on summoners. Summoners were officials in ecclesiastical courts who delivered a summons to people who had been brought up on various charges; the office was prone to corruption, since summoners were infamous for threatening to bring people up on charges unless they were bought off. The Friar had accused them of corruption and taking bribes and the Summoner seeks to address the Friar through his own story.\n\nThere are in fact several tales which the Summoner tells and all of them directed at friars. The main tale of a grasping friar seems to contain many original elements composed by Chaucer but Jill Mann suggests that it is based on 'The Tale of the Priest's Bowels', a French thirteenth-century fabliau:\n\n'A pious priest, when on his deathbed, was urged by two holy friars to revoke some of the charitable bequests he has already made, so that he may give something to their order. The priest promises to give them a precious jewel, which turns out to be a gaseous release from his bowels.'\n\nThe bawdy story the Summoner tells in his prologue seems to be an inversion of a story in Caesarius of Heisterbach's \"Dialogus miraculorum\". In Heisterbach's story, a monk ascends to heaven and finds his fellow Cistercians living under the cloak of the Virgin Mary. In the Summoner's version the friar descends into hell and not seeing any other friars believes they are all such goodly men, but the angel who accompanies him says to Satan:\n\nWith that the \"freres\" (friars) fly out Satan's \"ers\" (arse), swarm about the room and disappear back up his \"ers\".\n\nA friar went to preach and beg in a marshy region of Yorkshire called Holderness. In his sermons he begged for donations for the church and afterward he begged for charity from the local residents. The Friar interrupts the story, calling the Summoner a liar, but is silenced by the Host.\n\nThe friar in the story continued to beg house by house until he came to the house of Thomas, a local resident who normally indulged him, and found him ill. The friar spoke of the sermon he had given that day, commenting on the excellent way he had glossed the biblical text (and making the famous comment that \"Glosynge is a glorious thyng\") – and essentially ordered a meal from Thomas's wife.\n\nShe told the friar that her child had died recently. The friar claimed that he had a revelation that her child had died and entered heaven. He claimed that his fellow friars had a similar vision, for they are more privy to God's messages than laymen, who live richly on earth, as opposed to spiritual riches. The friar claimed that, among the clergy, only friars remain impoverished and thus are closest to God; and told Thomas that his illness persists because he had given so little to the church.\n\nThomas claimed that he had indeed given \"ful many a pound\" to various friars, but never fared the better for it. The friar, characteristically, is irritated that Thomas is not giving all of his money solely to him, and points out to him that a \"ferthyng\" (a farthing) is not worth anything if split into twelve. Continuing to lecture Thomas, the friar began a long sermon against anger (\"ire\"), telling the tale of an angry king who sentenced a knight to death, because, as he returned without his partner, the king automatically assumed that the knight had murdered him. When a third knight took the condemned knight to his death, they found the knight that he had supposedly murdered. When they returned to the king to have the sentence reversed, the king sentenced all three to death: the first because he had originally declared it so, the second because he was the cause of the first's death, and the third because he did not obey the king.\n\nAnother ireful king, Cambises, was a drunk. When one of his knights claimed that drunkenness caused people to lose their co-ordination, Cambyses drew his bow and arrow and shot the knight's son to prove that he still had control of his reflexes. The friar then told of Cyrus, the Persian king who had the river Gyndes destroyed because one of his horses had drowned in it.\nAt the close of this sermon, the friar asked Thomas for money to build the brothers' cloister. Thomas, annoyed by the friar's hypocrisy, told the friar that he had a gift for him that he was sitting on, but that he would only receive it if he promised to split it up equally between each of the friars.\n\nThe friar readily agreed, and put his hand down behind Thomas' back, groping round – and Thomas let out a fart louder than a horse could make. The friar became immediately angry, and promised to repay Thomas for his fart, but, before he could, the servants of the house chased the friar out.\n\nThe enraged friar found the lord of the village and told him of the embarrassment he suffered, angrily wondering how he was supposed to divide a fart into twelve. The lord's squire spoke up with a suggestion, in return for a \"gowne-clooth\" from his master: take a cartwheel, and tell each of twelve friars to lay his nose at the end of a spoke. Then the friar of the tale could sit in the centre of the wheel and fart, and each of the spokes would carry the smell along to the rim – and therefore, divide it up between each of the friars.\n\nThe Summoner uses the tale to satirise friars in general, with their long sermonising and their tendency to live well despite vows of poverty. It reflects on the theme of clerical corruption, a common one within \"The Canterbury Tales\" and within the wider 14th-century world as seen by the Lollard movement. The attitude of the lord implies that he is as unimpressed as any layman with the friars.\n\nNeither the Summoner's nor The Friar's Tale leave either of them looking particularly good. After the Friar's tale the Summoner does not use his own tale to defend summoners but rather he replies with his own attack. The short stories warning about ire within his main story are possibly a comment on the unheeded anger between both of them.\n\nHe is described as being lecherous with his red face disfigured with boils and—like the Miller and the Cook—quite drunk. His shield is described as a barley cake. Among his other attributes is extortion-dealing out false summons to court and either tricking foolish persons to bribe him with tavern feasts-or being beaten up by a potential victim; also theft-taking more than his share of court fines; and being a pimp and then blackmailing victims. He also wears a garland of oak leaves; since such a garland proclaimed the wearer was a \"King of Outlaws\" (i.e. William Wallace), Chaucer's readers would have recognised the Summoner as a corrupt clerical servant (as satirised in The Friar's Tale).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2032040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032040", "title": "Culture of Cornwall", "text": "Culture of Cornwall\n\nThe culture of Cornwall () forms part of the culture of the United Kingdom, but has distinct customs, traditions and peculiarities. Cornwall has many strong local traditions. After many years of decline, Cornish culture has undergone a strong revival, and many groups exist to promote Cornwall's culture and language today.\n\nThe Cornish language is a Celtic language closely related to Breton and slightly less so to Welsh. All of these are directly descended from the British language formerly spoken throughout most of Britain. The language went into decline following the introduction of the English \"Book of Common Prayer\" (in 1549) and by the turn of the 19th century had ceased to be used as a community language, (see main article for further discussion.)\n\nDuring the 19th century researchers began to study the language from any remaining isolated speakers and in 1904 Henry Jenner published \"A Handbook in the Cornish Language\" which started the revival proper. Although less than 1% of Cornwall's population speak the language and 'mother tongue' speakers are in their hundreds rather than thousands, the language continues to play a significant part in the culture of Cornwall.\n\nSome events will use Cornish, in short phrases, openings, greetings or names. There is a healthy tradition of music in the language, which can also be enjoyed by non-speakers. The vast majority of place names in Cornwall are derived from the language, and many people who live in Cornwall know a few words or phrases, e.g. 'Kernow bys vyken!' ('Cornwall forever!). Many Cornish houses, businesses, children, pets and boats are named in the language, thus it has use as an \"official community language\" and any Cornish speaker will often be asked to provide translations. The language is also used in official business, with the home of Cornwall Council being renamed from New County Hall to Lys Kernow and several of the region's MPs using the language in the Houses of Parliament. These include Andrew George, Dan Rogerson, Sarah Newton and Scott Mann, who have all used the language, at various times, to swear their oaths of allegiance to the Queen.\n\nThe ancient Brythonic country shares much of its cultural history with neighbouring Devon and Somerset in England and Wales and Brittany further afield. Historic records of authentic Cornish mythology or history are hard to verify but the earliest Cornish language (such as the Bodmin manumissions) marks the separation of Primitive Cornish from Old Welsh often dated to the Battle of Deorham in 577.\n\nDue to language erosion and possible suppression caused by the dominant English language and culture in the later medieval period, many works of Cornish language are thought to have been lost, particularly at the time of the dissolution of the religious houses of Glasney College and Crantock College, which were regarded as repertories of 'Welsh' (i.e., foreign) conservatism by the English. Cornish grievances against the policies of the English government led to the unsuccessful uprisings of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 and the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549.\n\nHowever, significant portions of the 'Matter of Britain' relate to the people of Cornwall and Brittany as they do to the modern 'Welsh'--this extends from Geoffrey of Monmouth to the Mabinogion and the Breton-derived tales of King Arthur which make frequent and explicit reference to the geography of the early Brythonic nation, such as his capital at 'Kelliwic in Cerniw' and the legendary sea fortress of King Mergh at Tintagel.\n\nBy the Shakespearean period, these ancient texts still maintained a currency demonstrated by \"King Lear\" based on the ancient tale of Leir of Britain which names Corineus the eponymous founder of the Cornish nation; he traditionally wrestled the giant Goemagot into the sea at Plymouth Hoe and claimed the land beyond for his people; the probable origin of the tale of Jack the Giant Killer.\n\nThe earliest Cornish literature is in the Cornish language and Cornwall produced a substantial number of passion plays during the Middle Ages. Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the language: they were performed in round 'plen a gwary' (place for playing) open-air theatres. \n\nThere is much traditional folklore in Cornwall, often tales of giants, mermaids, piskies or the 'pobel vean' (little people). These are still surprisingly popular today, with many events hosting a 'droll teller' to tell the stories: such myths and stories have found much publishing success, particularly in children's books.\n\nWriting in the Cornish dialect has generally been overshadowed by the Cornish language. However, from the 19th century onwards poems and short stories have been published, often with a typically Cornish humour. Some Cornish newspapers have featured a column written in Cornish dialect. e.g. \"The Cornish & Devon Post\" . Then there are literary works in standard English including conversations between dialect speakers.\n\n\"Cornish World\", a colour magazine produced in Cornwall and covering all aspects of Cornish life has proved popular with the descendants of Cornish emigrants as well as Cornish residents. It includes a column in the Cornish language.\n\nCharles Causley was born in Launceston and is perhaps the best known of Cornish poets.\n\nThe Nobel-prizewinning novelist William Golding who was born in St Columb Minor in 1911, and returned to live near Truro from 1985 until his death in 1993.\n\nOther notable Cornish writers include Arthur Quiller-Couch, alias \"Q\", novelist and literary critic, Jack Clemo, deaf-blind poet, Ronald Bottrall, modernist poet, Robert Stephen Hawker, eccentric Victorian poet and priest, Geoffrey Grigson, poet and critic, Silas Hocking, a prolific novelist, and D. M. Thomas, novelist and poet.\n\nThe late Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman was famously fond of Cornwall and it featured prominently in his poetry. He is buried in the churchyard at St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick.\n\nThe poet Laurence Binyon wrote \"For the Fallen\" (first published in 1914) while sitting on the cliffs between Pentire Point and The Rumps and a stone plaque was erected in 2001 to commemorate the fact. The plaque bears the inscription \"For The Fallen Composed on these cliffs 1914\" The plaque also bears the fourth stanza (sometimes referred to as 'The Ode') of the poem.\n\nNovels or parts of novels set in Cornwall include:-\n\nDaphne du Maurier lived in Fowey, Cornwall and many of her novels had Cornish settings, including \"Rebecca\", \"Jamaica Inn\", \"Frenchman's Creek\", \"My Cousin Rachel\", and \"The House on the Strand\". She is also noted for writing \"Vanishing Cornwall\". Cornwall provided the inspiration for \"The Birds\", one of her terrifying series of short stories, made famous as a film by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nConan Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot\" featuring Sherlock Holmes is set in Cornwall.\nHoward Spring lived in Cornwall from 1939 and set part or all of various novels in the County.\n\nMedieval Cornwall is also the setting of the trilogy by Monica Furlong, \"Wise Child\", \"Juniper\", and \"Colman\", as well as part of Charles Kingsley's \"Hereward the Wake\".\n\nWinston Graham's series \"Poldark\" (and the television series derived from it), Kate Tremayne's Adam Loveday series, and \"Greenwitch\", and Mary Wesley's \"The Camomile Lawn\" are all set in Cornwall. Writing under the pseudonym of Alexander Kent, Douglas Reeman sets parts of his Richard Bolitho and Adam Bolitho series in the Cornwall of the late 18th and the early 19th centuries, particularly in Falmouth.\n\nHammond Innes's novel, \"The Killer Mine\"; also has a Cornish setting.\n\nCharles de Lint, writer of many modern and urban fairy tales, set his novel \"The Little Country\" in the village of Mousehole in Cornwall.\n\nChapters 24 and 25 of J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" take place in Cornwall (the Harry Potter story at Shell Cottage, which is on the beach outside the fictional village of Tinworth in Cornwall).\n\n\"Over Sea, Under Stone\" and \"Greenwitch\" from the series of fantasy novels \"The Dark Is Rising\", by Susan Cooper, are set in Cornwall. Ciji Ware* set her 1997 novel \"A Cottage by the Sea\" on the Cornish coast. Sue Limb's \"Girl, (Nearly) 16: Absolute Torture\" is partly set in St Ives on the Cornish coast.\n\nCornwall is featured heavily in the beginning of \"The Mists of Avalon\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley as the home of Igraine, wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall. The castle at Tintagel has been said to be where King Arthur was conceived (when Uther Pendragon entered the castle in the form of Gorlois).\n\nAgatha Christie's \"Poirot\" short story, \"The Cornish Adventure\" take place in Polgarwith, an (imaginary) small market town in Cornwall.\n\nCornwall produced a substantial number of passion plays such as the Ordinalia during the Middle Ages. Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the Cornish language. Other notable plays include \"Beunans Meriasek\" and \"Beunans Ke\", the only two surviving plays written in any of Britain's vernacular tongues that take a saint's life as their subject.\nSir Arthur Quiller-Couch author of many novels and works of literary criticism lived in Fowey: his novels are mainly set in Cornwall. Prolific writer Colin Wilson, best known for his debut work \"The Outsider\" (1956) and for \"The Mind Parasites\" (1967), lived in Gorran Haven, a village on the southern Cornish coast, not far from Mevagissey. A. L. Rowse, the historian and poet, was born near St Austell.\n\nThomas Hardy's drama \"The Queen of Cornwall\" (1923) is a version of the Tristan story; the second act of Richard Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\" takes place in Cornwall, as do Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and \"Ruddigore\". A level of \"\", a videogame dealing with Arthurian legend, takes place in Cornwall at a tacky museum above King Arthur's tomb.\n\nThe theatre company Kneehigh Theatre is active in Cornwall. Amateur theatre groups exist in many villages, and the open air Minack Theatre is well known.\n\nThe fairy tale Jack the Giant Killer takes place in Cornwall.\n\nSee also List of Cornish saints\nCeltic Christianity was a feature of Cornwall and many Cornish Saints are commemorated in legends, churches and placenames.\n\nTraditionally, the Cornish have been non-conformists in religion. In 1549, the Prayer Book Rebellion caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. The Methodism of John Wesley also proved to be very popular with the working classes in Cornwall in the 18th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing a central role in the social lives of working-class Cornishmen. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Cornwall today, although Cornwall has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling. \n\nIn contrast to the situation in Wales, the churches failed to produce a translation of the Bible into the local language, and this has been seen by some as a crucial factor in the demise of the language. \nThe Bible was translated into Cornish in 2002.\n\nRenewed interest in Celtic Christianity\n\nIn the late 20th century and early 21st century there has been a renewed interest in the older forms of Christianity in Cornwall. Cowethas Peran Sans, the Fellowship of St Piran, is one such group promoting Celtic Christianity. The group was founded by Andrew Phillips and membership is open to baptised Christians in good standing in their local community who support the aims of the group.\n\nThe aims of the group are these:\n\nFry an Spyrys\n\nIn 2003, a campaign group was formed called \"Fry an Spyrys\" (free the spirit in Cornish). It is dedicated to disestablishing the Church of England in Cornwall and to forming an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion – a Church of Cornwall. Its chairman is Dr Garry Tregidga of the Institute of Cornish Studies. The Anglican Church was disestablished in Wales to form the Church in Wales in 1920 and in Ireland to form the Church of Ireland in 1869.\n\nSaint Piran's Flag, a white cross on a black background is often seen in Cornwall. The Duchy of Cornwall shield of 15 gold bezants on a black field is also used. Because of these two symbols black, white and gold are considered colours symbolic of Cornwall.\n\nThe chough (in Cornish = \"palores\") is also used as a symbol of Cornwall. In Cornish poetry the chough is used to symbolise the spirit of Cornwall. Also there is a Cornish belief that King Arthur lives in the form of a chough. \"Chough\" was also used as a nickname for Cornish people.\n\nAnother animal with a deep association with Cornwall is the “White Horse of Lyonesse”. Arthurian legends tell of a rider escaping on a white horse as the land sunk beneath the waves, surviving and settling in Cornwall.\n\nAn anvil is sometimes used to symbolise Cornish nationalism, particularly in its more extreme forms. This is a reference to 'Michael An Gof', 'the smith', one of two leaders of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497.\n\nFish, tin and copper together are used symbolically as they show the 'traditional' three main industries of Cornwall. Tin has a special place in the Cornish culture, the 'Stannary Parliament' and 'Cornish pennies' are a testament to the former power of the Cornish tin industry. Cornish tin is highly prized for jewellery, often of mine engines or Celtic designs. \n\nAlthough Cornwall has no official flower many people favour the Cornish heath (Erica vagans). In recent years daffodils have been popular on the annual Saint Piran's day march on Perran Sands although they are donated by a local daffodil grower and it is already considered to be the national flower of Wales.\n\nThe Institute of Cornish Studies, established in 1970, moved to the new Combined Universities in Cornwall Campus at Tremough, Penryn in October 2004: the institute is a branch of the University of Exeter. A detailed overview of literature is provided by Alan M. Kent's \"The Literature of Cornwall\": it covers everything from medieval mystery plays to more recent literary works that draw on the Cornish landscape.\n\nThe historian Philip Payton, professor at Exeter University's department of Cornish studies, has written \"Cornwall: a History\" as well as editing the Cornish studies series. Mark Stoyle, Senior Lecturer in Early Modern History at the University of Southampton, asks 'Are the Cornish English?’ in his book \"West Britons\", a work on Cornish history exploring the nature of Cornishness in the early modern period. John Angarrack of the human rights organisation Cornwall 2000 has self-published two books to date, \"Breaking the Chains\" and \"Our Future is History\": both are polemical re-examinations of Cornish history and identity, not historical works.\n\nThe Federation of Old Cornwall Societies is a group of societies of those interested in Cornwall's past which has published a number of books.\n\nSo-called 'Celtic art' is found in Cornwall reflecting its ancient Brythonic heritage, often in the form of Celtic crosses erected from the 6th century onwards. The Trewhiddle style is an insular style of black and white niello metalwork named after an important Cornish find from the 9th century. Many place-names are formed with the element \"Lan\" of sacred enclosures of early Cornish saints from Wales, Ireland and Brittany. The activities of these saints resulted in a shared cultural inheritance which particularly includes the post-Roman corpus of literature relating to King Arthur and Tristan and Iseult, presumed nobility of ancient Dumnonia. .Cornwall boasts the highest density of traditional 'Celtic crosses' of any nation, and medieval holy wells are numerous. The destruction of monastic institutions such as Glasney College and Crantock during the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536–45) is often regarded as the death knell of independence in Cornish language and culture; the very few remaining Cornish language manuscripts, including the miracle plays Beunans Ke and Beunans Meriasek are thought to have originated at these ancient centres of academic excellence, some areas however retain their outdoor performance spaces, known as plen an gwary. After the First World War, many new crosses were erected as war memorials and to celebrate events, e.g. the beginning of the third millennium. \n\nCornwall and its dramatic landscape and distinctive remoteness have produced and inspired many later artists. John Opie was the first Cornish-born artist of note and J. M. W. Turner visited in 1811. A number of London artists settled in the Newlyn area in the 1880s, following the building of the Great Western Railway, who went on to form the Newlyn School.\n\nSickert and Whistler both visited St Ives at the end of the 19th century, and the internationally famous studio potter, Bernard Leach set up his pottery in the town in 1920 St. Ives. In 1928 Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood visited the town and met Alfred Wallis the naive painter, native to St Ives, who was to become an important influence on a generation of British artists: particularly those who were members of the Seven and Five Society.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II Nicholson came to live in St Ives with his wife Barbara Hepworth; staying initially with the philosopher and writer Adrian Stokes (critic) and his wife Margaret Mellis. Naum Gabo also joined them there as well as artists who at the time were at an earlier stage in their careers: John Wells, Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, Terry Frost and Bryan Wynter. Other artists of international repute joined the colony later: notably Patrick Heron, Roger Hilton and Sandra Blow.\n\nThere are still a lot of artists in Cornwall many associated with the Newlyn Society of Artists. Artists led projects like PALP and artsurgery have also been important in the 21st century. \n\nCornish vernacular architecture is characterised by its use of abundant natural stone, especially Cornubian granite, slate, and local white lime-washing and its plain unadorned simplicity, sharing cultural and stylistic similarities, with the architecture of Atlantic Brittany, Ireland and Wales, as well as neighbouring Devon. The architecture of west Cornish towns such as St Ives is particularly distinctive for its use of solid granite and featuring also the type of early promontory hermitage particularly associated with Celtic Christianity.\n\nEarly and continuous use of stone architecture over more than two thousand years, begins with the Romano-British enclosed courtyard houses at Carn Euny and Chysauster is regionally distinct from the largely rectangular timber-derived architecture of Saxon England and often features characteristically rounded or circular forms - such as the ringforts, roundhouses and enclosed settlements known locally as \"rounds\" - the influence of which can be detected up to the building of Launceston Castle and Restormel Castle in the later medieval.\nThe medieval longhouse was the typical form of housing in early Cornish 'Tre' dispersed settlements of small hamlets of farmsteads and associated field systems apparently originating from before the time of the Norman conquest. The longhouse form is notable for its combined accommodation of humans and precious livestock under a single roof in a form found distributed across northwestern Atlantic Europe; France (\"Longere\") Brittany (\"Ty Hir\"), Normandy, Devon and South Wales (\"Ty Hir\") .\nEcclesiastical architecture of Cornwall and Devon typically differs from that of the rest of southern England: most medieval churches in the larger parishes were rebuilt in the later medieval period with one or two aisles and a western tower, the aisles being the same width as the nave and the piers of the arcades being of one of a few standard types; the former monastery church at St Germans demonstrates these features over several periods as the former seat of the bishop of Cornwall. Wagon roofs often survive in these churches. The typical tower is of three stages, often with buttresses set back from the angles.\n\nChurches of the Decorated period are relatively rare, as are those with spires. There are very few churches from the 17th and 18th centuries. There is a distinctive type of Norman font in many Cornish churches which is sometimes called the Altarnun type. The style of carving in benchends is also recognisably Cornish.\n\nCornwall has a rich and vibrant folk music tradition which has survived into the present.\n\nCornish players are regular participants in inter-Celtic festivals, and Cornwall itself has several lively inter-Celtic festivals such as Perranporth's folk festival, Lowender Peran.\n\nCornish Celtic music is a relatively large phenomenon given the size of the region. A recent tally found over 100 bands playing mostly or entirely Cornish folk music. Traditional dancing (Cornish dance) is associated with the music. These dance events are either \"Troyls\", (a dance night more similar to a ceilidh) or \"Nozow looan\", (a dance night more similar to a Breton \"Fest Noz\").\n\nAphex Twin is a Cornish-based electronic music artist, though he was born of Welsh parents in Ireland. Many other pop musicians are based in Cornwall but many of them originate elsewhere.\n\nLanner and District Silver Band is a Cornish Brass band based in Lanner, Cornwall, United Kingdom, and well known for its concerts. There are many other brass and silver bands in Cornwall, particularly in the former mining areas: St Dennis is a notable example.\n\nRecently some bands, such as Hanterhir, have fused classical Cornish folk music with other genre's like rock music.\n\nThere is a long tradition of processional dance and music in Cornwall. The best known tradition is the Helston Furry. The term 'furry' is used generally to describe such a dance or associated tune. These bands have been referred to as 'crowders and horners' and generally have a motley mix of instruments with folk instruments such as the fiddle, bagpipe or crowdy crawn mixed up with brass, reed and anything that can be carried.\n\nPadstow 'Obby 'Oss festival takes place on 1 May, the feast of Beltane to Celtic people.\n\nGolowan festival in Penzance, which was revived in 1991, was part of a much wider tradition of midsummer festivals where bonfires were lit on hilltops on Midsummer's Eve. The tradition of midsummer bonfires continues, albeit to a lesser extent than when fires could be seen on every hilltop, throughout Cornwall.\n\nLowender Perran is held at the end of October in Perranporth. This is a gathering of musicians and dancers from the six Celtic nations.\n\nHistorically Cornwall has had close links with Brittany and this is reflected in the music. The Cornish and Breton languages were mutually intelligible until Tudor times and there were many Bretons living in Cornwall before the Prayer Book Rebellion. Myths, saints, dances and tunes are often shared with Brittany. It has been noted that The Kroaz Du (Black Cross) flag used in medieval Brittany is the exact inverse of the Cornish flag, whether there is a reason for this is unknown. Breton flags are popular in Cornwall and are often seen alongside the Cornish flag on car bumpers and at musical events. This link continues today with Cornish-Breton festivals such as 'AberFest' in Falmouth (Aberfal) and the twinning of Cornish and Breton towns.\nThe Gorseth Kernow (or gorsedh), which was set up in 1928, is similar to the Welsh Gorsedd, and indeed was formed by the Welsh Gorsedd at the request of Henry Jenner. The Cornish Gorseth promotes the arts and the Cornish language through competitions at the open gorseth.\n\nCornwall has a small but growing film industry, mostly focusing on the Cornish language and culture. Numerous films, short and long, have been made in Cornwall. The Cornish film industry is supported by organisations such as War-rag (War-rag meaning \"ahead\" in Cornish).\n\nThe Celtic Film and Television Festival includes entries from Cornish film makers, and was held in Falmouth in 2006. Also the Goel Fylm Kernow/Cornwall Film Festival is held once a year, and supports Cornish film making, including films made in the Cornish or English language.\n\nGoel Fylm Kernow also hosts workshops, screenings and the \"Govynn Kernewek\" competition. In this competition applicants can present their ideas for films to be made in the Cornish language. The prizes in the competition consist of financial, material and technical support for making the film. Films made following this award include \"Kernow's Kick Ass Kung-Fu Kweens\" (2004), a kung fu film in Cornish.\n\nThe only known feature-length film in the Cornish language is \"Hwerow Hweg\" (\"Bitter Sweet\"), which was filmed alongside an English version. However, although it did not become as popular as was hoped, it was nominated for Best Feature Length Film at the 2002 Celtic Film and Television Festival. There are a number of short films which have been made in the language.\n\nCornwall is famous for its pasties (a type of pie often containing meat), but saffron buns, Cornish Heavy (Hevva) Cake, Cornish fairings (biscuit), Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream are also common.\n\nCornish clotted cream is a popular topping on splits and on scones. Opinion varies as to whether or not the cream should be spread on before or after the jam. Clotted cream is often served as \"thunder and lightning\" (with syrup on bread.)\n\nThere are also many types of beers brewed in Cornwall including a stout and there is some small scale production of cider and wine.\n\nSee Sport in Cornwall\n\nEuchre is a popular card game in Cornwall, it is normally a game for four players consisting of two teams. Its origins are unclear but some claim it is a Cornish game, and was popularised in part by Cornish immigrants to the United States. There are several leagues in Cornwall at present. Whist and pub quizzes are also popular in many villages.\n\nThe \"traditional dress\" of Cornwall for women is a bal maiden's or fishwife's costume. This includes the wearing of a bonnet known as a \"gook\" (which were peculiar to a district or community,) aprons and woollen shawls.\n\nFor men fishermen's smocks, Guernsey sweaters (known as worsted-frocks in Cornwall) and long cut shirts are worn.\n\nThe adoption of the Cornish kilt has recently become popular, and these kilts are available in various Cornish tartans or plain black. The first reference to a \"Cornish\" kilt is from 1903 when the Cornish delegate to the Celtic Congress, convening at Caernarvon, L. C. R. Duncombe-Jewell, appeared in a woad blue kilt, to impress upon the delegates the Celtic character of Cornwall. Black kilts are proposed by some as the traditional version of the garment, some claiming that the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry wore black kilts on occasions in the 19th century (this may have been similar to the Irish saffron kilt). The most common kilt used in Cornwall is pleated Scottish-style with a leather, Duchy of Cornwall shield-style, sporran.\n\nThe Cornish national tartan was designed by E. E Morton Nance in 1963 using colours traditionally associated with Cornwall. Fragments of tartan have been found in Penwith.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2032049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032049", "title": "Ukrainian shah", "text": "Ukrainian shah\n\nShah () was the name of several currencies used in Ukraine. The name derives from shilling via shelyag (\"sheleg\"; ; ). The forms \"shahy\" (шаги, for 2 to 4) and \"shahiv\" (шагiв, for five or more) are declensional plurals of the noun used in denominations, for example, 2 shahy, 20 shahiv.\n\nUkrainian-speakers used the term \"shah\" to refer to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's silver coin of 17th-18th centuries with face value of 3 grosz, coined from 1528, and especially during the times of Sigismund III Vasa (ruled Poland-Lithuania from 1587 to 1632). Later, when the Ukrainian lands came increasingly under the influence of Russia, the name was transferred to the Russian copper coin of 2 kopecks. From 1839, when the Russian Empire extended its silver coinage, the term \"shah\" was transferred to the silver ½-kopeck. This term for the kopeck remained in use until 1917.\n\nIn 1917, banknotes were introduced in the newly independent Ukraine. These were denominated in shah, hryvnia and karbovanets, with 100 shahiv = 1 hryvnia and 2 hryvni = 1 karbovanets.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, during World War I (1914—1918), many countries issued currency in the form of stamps. It was done similarly in early independent Ukrainian states: in West Ukrainian National Republic and Ukrainian People's Republic. There, these money stamps were called \"shahivky\" (шагiвки, singular: шагiвка, \"shahivka\"). Stamps in denominations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 shahiv were issued.\n\nThese shahivki were printed on perforated 11 ½ card stock, due to a shortage of metals needed for the war effort at the time. Each currency stamp was inscribed on the reverse with a tryzub (\"trident\") and with some words stating that these shahivki circulate in lieu of coins and that they are prohibited to be used as stamps. However, they do appear on some postal envelopes as there was an acute deficiency of \"true\" stamps. Nevertheless, on July 18, 1918, the independent Ukrainian government authorized its first set of stamp issues, also called shahivki and having nearly identical designs.\n\nThe 10 and 20-shah stamps issues of Ukrainian People's Republic were designed by the artist Anton Sereda and the 30, 40, and 50-shah stamps by Heorhiy Narbut, a master graphic artist and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in Kyiv.\n\nIn 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union after which the newly independent Ukraine was able to choose its own currency, trial runs of coins of 1 shah and 50 shahiv were issued, but were not approved. Therefore, the \"kopiyka\" (копійка) was confirmed as a numismatic term for Ukrainian currency, despite nationalistic sentiments that \"kopiyka\" (Ukrainian for Russian \"kopeyka\") is a Russian term.\n\n\n"}

They may be required to wear a uniform. The term, resembling the pronunciation for \"mother\" (see Mama and papa), is considered polite and respectful in the Chinese language.\n\nThe word \"amah\" may have originated from the Arabic \"amah\" meaning \"female slave\"\nThe word \"amah\" may have originated from the Portuguese \"ama\" meaning \"nurse\". Some however argued that it is the English form of the Chinese word \"ah mah\" (\"ah\" is a common Chinese prefix, and \"mah\" means \"little mother\"), while others say that it originated as \"nai mah\" (wet nurse in Chinese, literally \"milk mother\"). This word is common in East Asia, South East Asia and India to denote a maidservant or nursemaid. \n\nVariants such as \"Amah-chieh\" or \"mahjeh\" (\"chieh\" or \"jeh\" means elder sister in Chinese dialects) have also been used in some countries. In China, \"amah\" may even refer to any old lady in general. In Taiwan and southeastern China where the Minnan language is spoken, amah refers to the paternal grandmother. Similar terms in the same context includes \"ah-yee\" (Aunt), \"yee-yee\" (aunt), or \"jie-jie\" (elder sister). Since the mid-1990s, it has become more politically correct in some circles to call such a person a 'helper' rather than a maid or \"ayah\".\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty in China, the word \"amah\" was used as an informal and poetic title for the Taoist goddess, the Queen Mother of the West. Amah also means mother in many countries.\n\n\"Amah\" and \"ayah\" have been adopted as loanwords into the English language:\n\n\n"}

Tate also stars in all but one of the show's sketches, which feature a wide range of characters. \"The Catherine Tate Show\" airs on BBC Two and is shown worldwide through the BBC. Collectively, the show has been nominated for six BAFTA Awards, two British Comedy Awards and an Emmy Award, and it has won two Royal Television Society Awards, two British Comedy Awards and a National Television Award since its debut in 2004.\n\nThe first series of the show, which consisted of six episodes, aired from 16 February to 22 March 2004. A DVD of this series was released in August 2005.\n\nA second series aired from 21 July to 25 August 2005, and a 40-minute Christmas special was aired on 20 December 2005. For this series a new theme tune was introduced. A DVD of series two was released in October 2006.\n\nThe third series aired from 14 October to 25 November 2006. There had been speculation that this would be the final series; however, Tate explained in an interview on \"This Morning\" that she had never said this and would like to at least do specials in the future.\n\nTate filmed a Christmas special which aired on 25 December 2007, with viewing figures of 6.4 million. Tate has announced that there will be no more series after the special; however, a Christmas special was shown on 25 December 2009. Another 30 minute episode involving the Nan character was shown in January 2014. Two new Christmas specials aired on 27 and 30 December 2015 again involving Nan. On 4 January 2016, Tate announced that she does not plan to make anymore specials as she is busy with other projects.\n\nOn 24 November 2018, during the Sydney show of her Australian tour at the State Theatre, Tate revealed that there will be another series of the show.\nThis is only a list and small description of the most popular or well-known characters.\n\n\nThe first series of the show, which consisted of six episodes, aired from 16 February to 22 March 2004. The programme's theme tune for the first series was \"In These Shoes?\" by Kirsty MacColl, featured on her 2000 album \"Tropical Brainstorm\".\n\nIn the months preceding the launch of the second series, BBC Two aired three \"best of\" episodes, featuring a variety of the funniest clips from the six episodes of series one, including Lauren Cooper the teenager and Joannie Taylor the foul-mouthed grandmother. Meanwhile, repeats of all six episodes of the first series aired on UKTV G2 (now Dave). Tate also appeared in a comedy sketch with boy band McFly (see charity sketches for details).\n\nIn 2004, Catherine Tate won a British Comedy Award for \"Best Comedy Newcomer\" for her work on the first series of \"The Catherine Tate Show\".\n\nThe second series aired from 21 July to 25 August 2005. Following Tate's Comic Relief appearance with McFly, and speculation of her non-existent feud with David Schwimmer, it received slightly more publicity than series one in the run-up to the first episode. BBC Two also promoted the series by running trailers showing Lauren arguing with a furry dog in the shape of the channel's logo.\n\nThis series was far more successful with viewing figures than the first, securing ratings of 2.89 to 3.92 million, with the final episode receiving higher viewing figures than the episode of \"Extras\" which aired beforehand. Celebrities such as Peter Kay and Jill Halfpenny made guest appearances in series two. The series also had new theme music composed by Howard Goodall. For the opening, various characters are in an open field. The camera closes in on Lauren Cooper, zooms into her eye, then zooms out of Sheila Carter's eye. The camera pans to the right, where Bernie enters. The camera zooms into her eye, then zooms out of Nan's eye, where she is seen laughing. The end of the sequence shows the main title \"The Catherine Tate Show\". The zooming is the same for both series two and three although Shelia Carter does not appear in series three (in the 2007 Christmas Special, Sheila is replaced by Geordie Georgie).\n\nThe second series began airing in Australia on 4 April 2007 on ABC TV. Before this the BBC-owned Australian cable channel BBC UKTV had aired the complete series starting in 2004. The re-runs of the series were shown starting from 6 May 2007.\n\nIn November 2005, Tate was a guest at the 77th \"Royal Variety Performance\", and appeared in the guise of teenager Lauren Cooper, accompanied by Lauren's friends, Ryan and Liese. After Lauren embarrassed herself in front of the audience, Ryan pointed out that the Queen was laughing at her. Looking up at the Royal Box, she asked, \"Are you disrespecting me?\" and mimicked the Queen's accent, asking, \"Is one bovvered? Is one's face bovvered?\", before adding, \"Who is looking after the corgis?\" The Queen was seen laughing at this joke, and Prince Philip also appeared to take this in good humour. There were, however, reports that the Prince was extremely unimpressed by the performance and complained to the show's executive producer. She also appeared as Lauren in a special sketch for the BBC's annual Children in Need telethon. The segment was a crossover with \"EastEnders\" (see charity sketches for details).\n\nA Christmas show was aired on 20 December 2005. It featured appearances from celebrity guests Richard Park, Charlotte Church and Chas & Dave. During the show, Paul and Sam's two children were seen for the first time: they looked and acted exactly like their parents. The characters of Margaret and the enigmatic detective, who did not appear in series two, made appearances in the Christmas special. According to BARB's official viewing figures, over 5.66 million viewers watched the show, making it the most-watched programme at the time and the most watched programme on BBC Two the week it was aired. The show was also nominated for the People's Choice Award at the British Comedy Awards in 2005, but did not win after it was announced that the show had received fewer votes than \"Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway\". In an investigation, it was revealed in May 2008 that \"The Catherine Tate Show\" was the true winner of the British Comedy Award, and that Ant and Dec were wrongly awarded; Tate had actually received more votes from the public. A report by independent law firm, Olswang, said \"Robbie Williams was invited to present an award. It was understood that he would be happy [to do so] if the recipients were Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. In order to ensure his attendance, this assurance was given\"; however, it is not known if Williams' comments led to the wrong announcement. It was also exposed that the second half of the ceremony was not broadcast live but with a delay of half-an-hour, yet viewers were still encouraged to vote for the People's Choice Award, even though the votes had been counted and the trophy presented half-an-hour before.\n\nThe second series started airing on UKTV G2 in January 2006. Series one continued on UKTV Gold. The second series was also being screened on BBC America, and repeated on BBC Two, from June 2006. Following the success of series two, Tate launched a range of merchandise based on characters from the show in 2006. In September 2006 \"The Catherine Tate Show\" official calendar 2007 was released. Also, on 2 October 2006 a book was released of the scripts of both series one and two, called \"Am I Bovvered The Catherine Tate Show Scripts\".\n\nOn 13 December 2006, Tate won another British Comedy Award for \"Best TV Comedy Actress\" for her work in the second series of \"The Catherine Tate Show\".\n\nThe third series started on 26 October 2006 and ran until 25 November 2006. Before the launch of the series, it had been reported that BBC One controller Peter Fincham hoped to lure Tate to the channel; however, she decided to stay with BBC Two, where she would not be as pressured to secure higher ratings.\n\nThe series gained strong viewing figures for BBC Two, ranging from 4.00 to 4.92 million, becoming the top show on BBC Two each week. There were many more guest appearances in the third series which included Paul O'Grady being featured in a sketch with Joannie \"Nan\" Taylor when she appeared on \"The Paul O'Grady Show\".\n\nOn 19 February 2007, Tate appeared again on \"This Morning\" and stated that a forty-minute Comic Relief special had been made, which aired on 16 March 2007. Several sketches were interspersed throughout the Comic Relief programme, with guests such as the prime minister at the time, Tony Blair (see charity sketches for details). Kim Cattrall has also expressed an interest in appearing on an episode of the show. Cattrall commented that she is a \"huge fan\" and would like to be given a role.\n\nTate has revealed that she is considering taking the characters from the show on the road for a UK stage tour. Series Three was released on DVD on 12 November 2007. On 31 October 2007 \"The Catherine Tate Show\" won the National Television Award for most popular comedy as voted for by the public.\n\nA new Christmas special episode aired on 25 December 2007 on BBC One, in which pop star George Michael made a guest appearance. He was featured in several scenes with Irish nurse, Bernie, including one kissing scene. The character of Lauren was killed in a kayaking accident during the episode. Rumours had emerged about this story line in July 2007. Kathy Burke and Tamzin Outhwaite also guest starred, and the special averaged with 6.4 million viewers.\n\nThe episode was subject to criticism when some viewers complained about the amount of swearing, and accused Tate of bigotry over the depiction of a family from Northern Ireland as terrorists, whose Christmas presents included a balaclava and a pair of knuckle dusters, in reference to The Troubles. A statement was issued from the BBC that read \"Catherine Tate creates characters who are so over the top as to be almost cartoon-like and this is where her genius lies. Her comedy is never meant to offend any viewer and is always based on satire and grotesque exaggeration.\"\n\nAfter the complaints were made, an Ofcom report later concluded that the show was not offensive and did not violate broadcasting regulations. An extract from the Ofcom report read \"Overall this episode was typical of the Catherine Tate Show and would not have gone beyond the expectations of its usual audience. For those not familiar with the show, the information given at the start was adequate.\"\n\nDuring Tate's appearance on \"The Paul O'Grady Show\" on 24 September 2007, Tate did not make a reference to the speculation of there being any more series, but she did state that she may just continue her work on \"The Catherine Tate Show\" through one-off specials. It has since been announced by Tate that she does not plan any more series after the Christmas special. She commented: \"It's hard to keep coming up with ideas. And I'd like to stay in people's good graces, rather than, 'Oh no, she's not doing another series of that, is she?'\" Tate also left to concentrate on other projects such as her role as Donna Noble, in series four of \"Doctor Who\".\n\nThe BBC confirmed that a new Christmas special will be broadcast in December 2009, titled \"Nan's Christmas Carol\", featuring Tate's Nan character as Scrooge. The special guest stars Mathew Horne (reprising his role as Nan's grandson Jamie) and Ben Miller, David Tennant and Roger Lloyd-Pack as ghosts. Niky Wardley who played many various characters mainly Lisa Jackson, also returned as Joannie Taylor's mother. Despite this special, shown on 25 December 2009, Tate has reiterated that she has no plans for the show to make a full return.\n\nIn 2013, a new New Year's special was produced and was broadcast on 4 January 2014. The story features Nan as she is accompanied by a school girl named Alice, who has volunteered to visit Nan as part of the 'Young and Old Buddy-Up Foundation' while her grandson, Jamie is in Africa helping to build a school for orphans and keeps in contact with Nan regularly via Skype. As Nan's tap is broken, she and Alice head to the council to see if they can get someone to fix and there Nan land herself in trouble for 'disturbing the peace and simulating a heart attack' at the local community centre. Returning guest stars include Mathew Horne and Niky Wardley and with Ami Metcalf as Alice.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that two new 'Nan' specials were produced in 2015 and broadcast in December 2015. The first special was aired on 27 December 2015 and the second on 30 December 2015.\n\nIn early 2019, an announcement was made that \"Catherine Tate's Nan\" would be developed into a feature film adaptation. In September 2019, it was confirmed that the film would receive a release sometime in 2020. Alongside Tate, it was also confirmed that Matthew Horne would be returning as Jamie, and that fellow co-star of the original series, Niky Wardley, would also appear. It will be directed by Josie Rourke.\n\nTate appeared on the BBC's Comic Relief telethon in March 2005, in the guise of Lauren Cooper. In a section of the show, which featured fans of McFly asking questions to the group, Lauren decides to ask, \"Why are you so rubbish?\" When told by Simon Amstell, who is hosting the segment, that only positive questions are allowed, Lauren uses a variety of her catchphrases, including \"Am I bovvered?\" and \"Are you calling me stupid?\" Lauren is then \"ordered\" to ask a more positive question to the group, and confuses them with Busted, asking, \"Are you gutted that Charlie left?\" When told to leave the set, on her way out she asks Danny Jones from McFly to sign her knee, walking away promptly saying \"You can't even spell.\"\n\nIn November 2005, Tate appeared as Lauren in a special sketch for the BBC's annual Children in Need telethon. The segment is posed as a crossover with \"EastEnders\", featuring Barbara Windsor as Peggy Mitchell, Kacey Ainsworth as Little Mo and Lacey Turner as Stacey Slater. The sketch sees Lauren arrive in Walford in search of revenge on Stacey, who has apparently stolen her boyfriend. When she makes an appearance in the Queen Vic, Peggy finds herself getting increasingly frustrated with Lauren, who asks, \"Are you a Cockney? Are you a Cockney sparrow?\" (pronounced 'Cock-er-ney') and \"Do you know Chas & Dave? Are you their mum?\" repeatedly. Peggy also unintentionally uses some of Lauren's catchphrases, such as \"Are you disrespecting my family?\" and \"Are you calling me a ?\" Lauren eventually leaves the pub after mixing some famous lines from the soap, including \"Hello princess\" and \"Rickaay!\" with her usual catchphrase, \"Bovvered?\".\n\nIn the BBC's Sport Relief, Tate created a sketch as \"Nan\", commenting on the 1966 World Cup win and the comments of Kenneth Wolstenholme. The sketch involves \"Nan\" and her grandson watching a David Beckham football game, where she expresses her disgust at the objective of football by exclaiming \"What a load of old shit!\".\n\nOn 16 March 2007, Catherine Tate appeared on \"Red Nose Day 2007\" as many of her well-known characters from the show. The sketches were interspersed throughout the Comic Relief programme. Guests in sketches include David Tennant (who acts as Lauren Cooper's teacher and actually turns out to be the real Doctor), and Daniel Craig as another one of Elaine Figgis' boyfriends whom she has met through the internet. This sketch also spawned a popular internet meme \"Do you fancy Billie Piper, sir?\" During his time as prime minister, Tony Blair made a cameo appearance in a sketch, which features Lauren Cooper on work experience at 10 Downing Street. Upon Lauren attempting to tell Blair who the most famous person she has met is, he asks \"her\" if he is \"bovvered\". Geordie Georgie appeared with Lenny Henry when he does his own fund raising for Comic Relief, and Joannie Taylor also appeared on game show \"Deal or No Deal\" hosted by Noel Edmonds. The DVD of the sketches was available exclusively to Amazon and became the most pre-ordered DVD the site has ever seen.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, Nan appeared on the 2009 Comic Relief. She was receiving a cheque for her Community Centre from Fern Britton and Alan Carr. She was then disgusted that she only got £1000.\n\nOn 27 April 2016, Tate announced she would be taking her characters on tour later the same year. She performed in theatres across the UK between 31 October and 4 December 2016. Tate was joined on stage by long time collaborators Niky Wardley and Mathew Horne as well as actor and comedian Brett Goldstein playing various characters. The show also featured pre-recorded cutaway cameos by Billy Connolly (as God & the Devil), Richard Sandling (as Steve) and Nick Grimshaw (as himself).\n\nOn 17 October 2018, it was announced that the show would run in London's West End at the Wyndham's Theatre for one week from 7 to 12 January 2019. On 29 October 2018, tickets for shows were added due to popular demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three series and the Christmas specials of \"The Catherine Tate Show\" have been released on DVD. In the UK and Australia all three series have been separately released, with the first Christmas special (2005) being part of series two, a series one & two boxset was released, and a complete series boxset was released. The Australian version of the complete boxset includes the second Christmas special (2007), but, the UK version doesn't, it is released as a separate edition. The third Christmas special \"Nan's Christmas Carol\" (2009) has been released in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, Series one and two have only been released separately, and the first Christmas special is released as a separate edition.\n\n"}

{"id": "2032080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032080", "title": "The Bogie Man (comics)", "text": "The Bogie Man (comics)\n\nThe Bogie Man is a comic book series created by writers John Wagner and Alan Grant and artist Robin Smith. The main character is Francis Forbes Clunie, a Scottish mental patient who suffers from the delusion that he is Humphrey Bogart, or rather a composite of the characters he played in his films. Each story revolves round his construction of a completely fictional story in which he is the hero and only he can solve the \"mystery\" of his own construction.\n\nThe title was initially pitched to DC Comics but after they refused it, Wagner and Grant then decided to publish it independently with Fat Man Press, a publishing company based in Glasgow. A four issue black and white miniseries was published, beginning in 1989 to tie in with Glasgow being the 1990 European City of Culture, in which Clunie, newly escaped from a Glasgow mental hospital, stumbles on an attempt by small-time criminals to fence some stolen turkeys. Associating the \"big birds\" with \"The Maltese Falcon\", Clunie drags a gullible waitress and the nearest convenient \"fat man\" into proceedings, until, pursued by the criminals and the police and quoting dialogue from a variety of Bogart films, he demolishes half of Glasgow's Central Station. A collected edition was published by John Brown Publishing in 1992.\n\nMeanwhile, \"the Bogie Man\" next appeared in the pages of \"Toxic!\", a new weekly comic set up in 1991 in direct competition to \"2000 AD\". \"The Chinese Syndrome\", illustrated in colour by Cam Kennedy, involved Clunie thinking he is dealing with a gang of Chinese criminals in Glasgow, but was left uncompleted after co-creator Smith objected to infringement of his copyright. However, \"Toxic!\" did manage to publish a complete \"Bogie Man\" story, \"The Manhattan Project\", in which Clunie went to New York and rescued the then US Vice President Dan Quayle from an entirely imaginary assassination plot, illustrated in full colour by Robin Smith. A collected edition was published by Tundra Publishing in 1992. \"The Chinese Syndrome\" was later revamped, redrawn in black and white by Smith and completed as \"Chinatoon\", a four issue miniseries, and later a collected edition, published by Tundra's UK arm Atomeka Press in 1993. A collection of the first miniseries and \"Chinatoon\" was later published by Paradox Press in 1998.\n\nAfter this the character entered limbo for several years before a fourth story, \"Return to Casablanca\", was serialised in the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" in 2005. Illustrated once again in black and white by Smith, it involves Clunie mistaking a Scottish singer who had appeared before in \"Chinatoon\" for resistance leader Victor Laszlo from \"Casablanca\", while an old foe runs a scam involving illegal immigrants making shortbread, during the Edinburgh Festival.\n\n\nA television film version of \"The Bogie Man\" was produced by the BBC and screened on BBC2 during Christmas 1992. It starred Robbie Coltrane as Clunie, with Fiona Fullerton and Midge Ure, and was based upon the original four issue mini series. It was not received well by critics and had poor viewing figures.\n\nWagner and Grant felt the film was a huge disappointment, partially due to Coltrane's performance, but also due to the makers not granting them more influence in how it was made.\n\nIt has only ever been shown once and there are no plans to release the film on DVD.\n\n"}

Founded in 1915 as a boarding school for Polish boys, by the Salesians of Don Bosco, a religious community of priests and brothers, the school is situated on a campus in Ramsey, in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. The school is operated under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.\n\nLocated in northern New Jersey, approximately from the New JerseyNew York border, the school draws students from a wide geographical region, including Bergen, Passaic, Morris, Essex and Sussex counties in New Jersey as well as surrounding counties in New York.\n\nAs of the 2013-14 school year, the school had an enrollment of 871 students and 60.9 classroom teachers (on a full-time equivalent basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.3:1. The school's student body was 86.1% White, 5.7% Hispanic, 5.7% Black and 2.4% Asian.\n\nIn its early years, from 1915 to 1973, Don Bosco housed resident students on the upper floors of St. Johns Hall. Freshmen were in the center wing while upperclassmen stayed on the top floor in the north annex. During the 1960s, approximately 75 or 10% of the students lived on campus. Resident students attended Mass each morning and were allowed to go home each weekend starting around 1963. Prior to that, weekend home visits were periodic.\n\nThe school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools since 1960.

In the 2009-10 school year, the school competed in the North Jersey Tri-County Conference, which was established on an interim basis to facilitate realignment. Until the NJSIAA's 2009 realignment, the school had participated in Division C of the Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League, which was made up of high schools located in Bergen County, Essex County and Passaic County, and was separated into three divisions based on NJSIAA size classification.\n\nThe athletic teams are nicknamed the Ironmen and the school colors are maroon and white. In 2008 they were ranked as the number nine sports program in the nation by \"Sports Illustrated\".\nThe school was the Group A winner of the NJSIAA ShopRite Cup in 2006-07.

In 2009, they defeated Bergen Catholic High School in the Bergen County Tournament final 3-0, behind goals from Dylan Renna, Gio Esposito and Ryan McNamara. The Bergen County Coaches Association named Don Bosco's Ian Joyce and Steve Franchini to its All Decade Team, but selected Ramapo High School in 2010 as its Program of the Decade, despite both teams having won five championships in the ten-year span, citing the fact that Ramapo had beaten Don Bosco three of the four times the teams had played each other in the county championship.\n\nThe school's football program has been a perennial contender for the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Non-Public Group IV championship. The Ironmen have won 15 state championships, were declared winners in 1968, 1970 and 1973, and won playoff tournaments in 1983–84, 1990, 2002–03, 2006–11 and in 2015, defeating Saint Joseph Regional High School by a score of 21-10 to win the program's first title in four years.

The organization developed a project to print T-shirts bearing the phrase \"gay? fine by me\" and then worked with communities to distribute and wear the T-shirts to show acceptance and support for LGBT people and publicly demonstrate against homophobia.\n\nThe organization began at Duke University in spring 2003 after The Princeton Review's college guide ranked Duke number 1 in the category of \"Alternative Lifestyles not an alternative.\" Fine By Me started when, during a dinner conversation, ten friends, both gay and straight, came up with the idea to distribute free T-shirts with an anti-homophobic message The T-shirts were order and distributed by Lucas Schaefer, a junior, and Leila Nesson Wolfrom, a graduate student both at Duke University, and their friends. In less than two weeks, the group distributed nearly 2,000 T-shirts to students, faculty and staff. Even then university president, Nannerl 'Nan' Overholser Keohane, wore a T-shirt.\n\nWithin two years, Nesson Wolfrom had coordinated the distribution of more than 14,000 \"gay? fine by me\" shirts.\n\nThe idea continued to spread by word of mouth to schools all over the country including to traditionally conservative and religious institutions. When the student government backed by the board of trustees for the University of Notre Dame denied recognition of a gay straight alliance on campus, the students responded by pulling together the resources to purchase and hand out 3000 orange gay? fine by me t-shirts. Joe Dickmann, who was a board member of the unrecognized OutreachND said, \"[The] administration...gave us no support and repeatedly tried to sabotage our efforts...so we worked through email and word of mouth [to] deliver.. 2300 T-shirts by years end.\" Of the decision Nesson Wolfrom would say that the students \"couldn't change the rules, but they could completely overwhelm as a visible presence.\" \n\nOther traditionally conservative and religious institutions such as Boston College, and Texas A&M University would follow suit.\n\nSince its founding in 2003, the organization has expanded its focus to include churches and synagogues, local civic groups, PFLAG chapters, businesses, and other community groups and organizations. For groups wanting to show support, custom T-shirts are printed with a custom organizations name in place of \"us\" in \"gay? fine by us\".\n\nIn September 2008, Fine By Me became a special project of Atticus Circle.\n\n\n"}

Records.\n\nIt is different from the similarly titled 1971 release by the Peter Green incarnation of the band, and contains an entirely different track listing. The 1988 album in fact omits anything before 1975 including \"Albatross\", one of the band's biggest hits.\n\nThe album has proven to be a major success since the time of its release. It peaked at number 14 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, and sold steadily over the years since its release, and has to date been certified 8x platinum for shipping eight million copies there. In the United Kingdom it reached number three upon release and has returned several times to the UK album chart and has been certified triple platinum for shipping 900,000 copies there. In both the US and the UK, the album has returned to the album charts as recently as 2017.\n\nThe album contains two new tracks, \"As Long as You Follow\" (which was released as a single to promote the album), and \"No Questions Asked\". The track listing for the US release differs slightly from that of other territories. It includes the 1975 track \"Over My Head\" but omits the 1987 track \"Seven Wonders\" (despite it being a top 20 hit in the US) as well as the 1982 track \"Oh Diane\" (which failed to chart there in 1983, but was a top-ten hit in the UK).\n\nA number of sources state that this album was the last to be commercially released as an 8-track tape by a major label. The 8-track tape was released only as a Record Club version, as regular retail 8-track tapes had long since ceased by 1988. There is also a possibility that Journey's Greatest Hits album may have been the last commercially released 8-track, as there is debate on whether it was released on 15 November or 22 November 1988.\n\n\nOne US reissue by WB as #R1 25801, does not include tracks 7, 14 or 15, and the order of the tracks on the back side is completely different.\n\n\n\n"}

He has also performed with Cain's Offering, Altaria and Stratovarius vocalist Timo Kotipelto (his bandmate in Cain's Offering).\n\nMost of his technique is self-taught, even though he had a few guitar lessons early in his life. He is endorsed by Ibanez, plays a Destroyer DT 200 Custom, the Ibanez JPM4 P4 (which is John Petrucci's signature model), and Ibanez \"Streetwise\" USA Custom guitars & Ibanez Rg 2020X. He cites Freak Kitchen, Dream Theater, and Pain of Salvation as his biggest musical influences.\n\nHe currently resides in Kotka.\n\nJani was one of the founders of Sonata Arctica in 1995. Besides playing, he also contributed to the band's songwriting with \"My Selene\" on 2004's \"Reckoning Night\" and \"Prelude for Reckoning\", their introduction tape in \"For the Sake of Revenge\". He has also co-written three songs for the band's first album, Ecliptica, \"8th Commandment\", \"Replica\" and \"Picturing the Past\".\n\nIn May 2007, as a result of his failure to do his mandatory civil/military service he spent one month in a Finnish prison until he decided to perform these duties, because of this he and the other members of Sonata Arctica reached an agreement that they would go their separate ways. He left the band on good terms and was then replaced by Elias Viljanen.\n\nJani also played with Altaria, recording two full-length albums, before leaving them to concentrate on his work with Sonata Arctica. In addition, he has (or possibly had) a melodic death metal side-project called Graveyard Shift with former Sonata Arctica band-mate Henrik Klingenberg. He also played in a band called Sydänpuu (Hearttree), that plays rock music in Finnish. In Sydänpuu, he sings and plays guitars, bass, and keyboards alongside drummer Risto Koskinen under the Alias of Allan Anderssén.\n\nIn October 2007, he was the lead guitarist for metal singer Paul Di'Anno's Finnish tour. Since mid-September 2007, Jani has worked with new band Dream Asylum with Altaria singer/songwriter and former band-mate Marko Pukkila. They are yet to make any formal releases but have recorded a few demos.\n\nIn April 2009, Jani announced on his MySpace page that he would be playing in a band by the name of Cain's Offering. Info about the new lineup was also released in the April issue of \"Burrn!\" magazine. Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius and Mikko Härkin (ex-Sonata Arctica) were also a part of the band.

{"id": "2032182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032182", "title": "Eclectic shorthand", "text": "Eclectic shorthand\n\nEclectic shorthand (sometimes called \"Cross shorthand\" or \"Eclectic-Cross shorthand\" after its founder, J. G. Cross) is an English shorthand system of the 19th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it is nonetheless noteworthy as one of the most compact (and complex) systems of writing ever devised.\n\nWhile most later responses to Pitman shorthand aimed for greater simplicity and an elimination of such characteristics as shading and positional writing (cf Gregg shorthand), Cross took his system in the opposite direction. Noting that English spelling is able to express all its many vowel sounds using only five vowel symbols, Cross adopted a five-position system for expressing vowels in his system (Pitman uses three). From there he went on to apply the five positions to consonant symbols as well, and to eliminate perpendicular strokes to make the writing more cursive. Curiously for a symbol system, the writing is based on English spelling rather than phonetics — there are symbols for \"q\" and \"c\", for instance, and a \"wh\" symbol which is different from \"w\" (or \"h\").\n\nMany tricks are employed to make writing more compact: shading a vowel at the beginning of the stroke denotes that it is preceded by an \"r\"; shading the whole stroke denotes a diphthong, while shading the end of the stroke denotes a following \"r\". An \"l\" can be indicated by making the outline of the preceding letter smaller, and a following \"w\" by deepening the curve of the preceding stroke.\n\nAll in all, the system contains far more rules than any other widespread system of English shorthand, and the resulting notes are incredibly concise. However, the amount of practice required to make use of all these techniques without hesitation while taking dictation was undoubtedly quite burdensome. In addition, the heavy use of shading, common in nineteenth century systems when ink pens were the normal instrument of writing and the notion of thin and thick strokes was familiar to those accustomed to the copperplate script of the time, became difficult and counterintuitive in the 20th century. In sum, the system's complexity and the great investment of time that would have been needed to master it were most likely the causes for its downfall.\n\nAn interesting experiment used by Cross was to use paper with slightly curved lines for note-taking, on the assertion that as the hand could move more naturally in an arc across the page than in a straight line; this would improve speed.\n"}

William Stanier had concentrated on introducing larger engines and it was left to George Ivatt to introduce a new class of low-powered locomotive. He designed a tender version of the Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T, introduced at the same time, which was inspired by the Stanier Class 3 2-6-2T, which was inspired by the Fowler Class 3 2-6-2T. The 2-6-0s had greater range: of water and of coal compared to the tank design's and . So they were well-suited to their task and, following attention to draughting problems by both Derby and Swindon, quickly became a success. Further engines of this type were built as the BR standard class 2 2-6-0, these locomotives having BR standard fittings and a modified cab and tender profile to allow completely unrestricted route availability; both LMS and BR 2MT moguls are often nicknamed \"Mickey Mouse\".\n\nA total of 128 were built between 1946 and 1953, mostly at Crewe. 20 were built by LMS and given the numbers 6400–19. On nationalisation in 1948 40000 was added to their numbers to become 46400–19. The remaining 108 locomotives of the class, numbered 46420–46527 were built by British Railways, and from 46465 (Darlington, 1951) an increase in cylinder diameter of yielded a tractive effort of , greater than the original design. The LMS classified them 2F, BR as 2MT.\n\nThe 38 members of the Darlington-built batch (46465 to 46502) were allocated to the Eastern and North Eastern Regions of British Railways. The final 25 (46503 to 46527) were built at Swindon Works and, being allocated to the Western Region, consequently carried the GWR-type vacuum ejector and firehole doors. The Swindon locomotives were turned out, initially, in lined black. Under the Hanks regime, some received lined green livery as they passed through works. The rest carried black livery. None of the class was named in service, however some have been named in preservation.\n\nThe class was withdrawn between 1961 and 1967.\n\nSeven of the class have been preserved but only six engines have run in preservation (46428 is undergoing restoration from scrapyard condition to working order at the East Lancs Railway). Three members of the class have also operated on the mainline in preservation: No's 46441, 46443 & 46521.\n\n46443 Became a popular mainline engine in the 1980s when it was one of the engines used during the 150th anniversary of the Great Western Railway traveling along many old branchlines including the old Bristol Harbour Railway.\n\n46521 Saw use on the mainline in the 1990s but only saw a limited amount of use hauling excursion trains with one of its runs being on the GWML in December 1994.\n\n46441 Was one of the smallest tender engines to operate on the former BR system during the 90's. As well as being a regular at Carnforth and working at its home on the East Lancashire Railway it was also used for the regular steam on the met programme working trains alongside other steam engines. 46441 in recent years has been on static display inside the museum at the Ribble Steam Railway in Preston awaiting an overhaul. In April 2018 the engine was moved by road to its new home at the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway, it is presently the only tender engine based at the railway. The locos current owner Chris Beet who also owns LMS Jubilee no 45690 Leander is having the engine overhauled for use on the railway but it will not be returning to the mainline.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Named in preservation\n\nOnly 46428 has yet to steam in preservation.\n\nSeveral 00 gauge ready-to-run models of the locomotive have been produced. In 1975, Hornby Railways produced a model of the class, in British Railways lined black (mixed traffic) livery. A BR lined green version followed in 1978. They were on sale until 1982. In 2007 Bachmann Branchline introduced a more detailed model, available in several liveries including LMS unlined black, BR lined black and BR lined Brunswick Green, the latter livery of which was used for a model of now preserved 46521. Graham Farish produces several of the same liveries in N gauge. Comet Models produce an all-metal kit.\n\nNo. 46521 appeared in the sitcom Oh, Doctor Beeching! It was for this that it received the name 'Blossom'.\n\nBoth 46443 and 46521 appeared in the 1976 Universal Pictures film The Seven-Per-Cent Solution. For this role both locomotives were heavily disguised to have a European flavour.\n\nBoth \"Oh, Doctor Beeching!\" and \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\" were filmed on the Severn Valley Railway.\n\n"}

He has written widely on conflict resolution and mediation. He holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Colorado. In 1994 he became the founding director for the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University where he was a professor.\n\nLederach was born in Indiana into the family of a local preacher, whom he was named after. He graduated from Bethel College in 1980 with a degree in History and Peace Studies. During this time he was working for the Mennonite Board of Missions in Barcelona, Spain. He then pursued a Ph.D. in sociology with a concentration in the Social Conflict Program from the University of Colorado, receiving his degree in 1988. During this time (from 1975-1996) he was also active with the Mennonite Central Committee serving for a time as the Director of the Mennonite Conciliation Service.\nLederach's theories of elicitive methods of conflict resolution have been influential in the fields of political science, peace studies, international relations and conflict transformation. His works have been published in English, Catalan and Spanish.\n\nHis academic work draws on his experience in the field as a mediator, negotiator, peacebuilding practitioner, trainer and consultant. At the international level, this has involved input into peace processes in Somalia, Northern Ireland, Nicaragua, Colombia and Nepal. Within communities, his work has often been at the level of reconciliation within church and family. In 2014 he said:\n\"Change only comes through ensuring that people are represented. In Somalia where I did a lot of my early work, there was no government and it was a chaotic situation. My job was to engage in longer term bottom-up grassroots work. You do this by establishing organisations for elders, women's associations and so on which build strength into a community by creating space for civil society.\" - from a BBC interview \n\nHis elective approach to conflict transformation has been developed further systemically by Wolfgang Dietrich within the framework of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck, Austria.\n\nLederach has given keynote speeches, commencement addresses, and lectures, among them a keynote lecture entitled \"Narratives of Care: The Social Echo of Community Transformation\" at the Conversations on Attachment conference at Eastern Mennonite University. and a lecture entitled \"Compassionate Presence: Faith-Based Peacebuilding in the Face of Violence\" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.\n\nIn an article in \"Time Magazine\", former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy describes Lederach’s influence on his thinking about social policy and his framing of loneliness as a public health concern: “For John Paul Lederach, an international peace builder and expert in conflict transformation, the first step is to promote a mutual sense of belonging. That means meeting and serving people where they live, by physically going to their homes or neighborhoods.” Murthy quotes Lederach in \"Time\", as well as in his book, \"Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World\", as observing that “a lot of our isolation…is the degree to which people feel invisible. So, when you come and show up and have concern and conversation from their location, you’re rehumanizing the situation that has lost that connection at a very deep level.”\n\nLederach is a Mennonite Christian, and as he wrote in his 1999 book \"Journey Toward Reconciliation\" (), his Christian faith has affected both his thinking and application of non-violent solutions to conflict. In 2000, he received the Community of Christ International Peace Award.\n\nBill Hybels, founder and senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church, praised the book \"Journey Toward Reconciliation\" in a Christmas 2013 sermon series. Its publisher Herald Press subsequently released an updated edition under the title \"Reconcile: Conflict Transformation for Ordinary Christians\" in August 2014 (), which includes a foreword written by Hybels and his wife Lynne.\n\nDuring both days of the 20th Global Leadership Summit August 14–15, 2014, Hybels spoke on the significance of the book and the importance of its principles of peacemaking and conflict resolution for individuals as well as churches.\n\nIn 2014 he received honorary degrees from Conrad Grebel College at the University of Waterloo, St. Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\n\n"}

For example, Maulana Karenga (2001) puts slavery in the broader context of the \"Maafa\", suggesting that its effects exceed mere physical persecution and legal disenfranchisement: the \"destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples\".\n\nUsage of the in English was introduced by Marimba Ani's 1998 book \"Let the Circle Be Unbroken: The Implications of African Spirituality in the Diaspora\". It is derived from a Swahili term for \"disaster, terrible occurrence or great tragedy\". The term was popularized in the 1990s.\n\nThe term \"African Holocaust\" is preferred by some academics, such as Maulana Karenga, because it implies intention. One problem noted by Karenga is that the word \"Maafa\" can also translate to \"accident\" and in the view of some scholars the holocaust of enslavement was not accidental. Ali Mazrui notes that the word \"holocaust\" is a \"dual plagiarism\" since the term is derived from Ancient Greek and thus despite being associated with the genocide of the Jews, no one can have a monopoly over the term. Mazrui states: \"This borrowing from borrowers without attribution is what I call 'the dual plagiarism.' But this plagiarism is defensible because the vocabulary of horrors like genocide and enslavement should not be subject to copyright-restrictions\".\n\nSome Afrocentric scholars prefer the term \"Maafa\" to \"African Holocaust\" because they believe that indigenous African terminology more truly conveys the events. The term \"Maafa\" may serve \"much the same cultural psychological purpose for Africans as the idea of the \"Holocaust\" serves to name the culturally distinct Jewish experience of genocide under German Nazism\". Other arguments in favor of \"Maafa\" rather than \"African Holocaust\" emphasize that the denial of the validity of the African people's humanity is an unparalleled centuries-long phenomenon: \"The Maafa is a continual, constant, complete, and total system of human negation and nullification\"-\n\nHistorian Sylviane Diouf posits that, the terms \"transatlantic slave trade\", \"Atlantic slave trade\" and \"slave trade\" are deeply problematic because they serve as euphemisms for intense violence and mass murder. Referred to as a \"trade\", this prolonged period of persecution and suffering is rendered as a commercial dilemma, rather than as a moral atrocity. With trade as the primary focus, the broader tragedy becomes consigned to a secondary point as mere \"collateral damage\" of a commercial venture. However, others feel that avoidance of the term \"trade\" is an apologetic act on behalf of capitalism, absolving capitalist structures of involvement in human catastrophe.\n\n\n"}

For the WWF, other than Ventura, Schiavone commentated alongside others including Lord Alfred Hayes, Gorilla Monsoon, Hillbilly Jim, Rod Trongard, and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan. Behind the scenes, Tony produced numerous home videos for Coliseum Video.\n\nSchiavone, who has remained on good terms with the McMahon family in the years since, admitted years later that leaving WWF was his biggest career mistake, and that he asked McMahon for his job back as soon as he realized what the Turner Broadcasting System had done to the former Jim Crockett Promotions upon acquiring it. McMahon turned him down, so that Schiavone wouldn't have to move his young family again, but was open to working with him in the future.\n\nSchiavone became the lead voice for WCW's flagship program, \"Monday Nitro\". He also served as the lead announcer of \"Thunder\", typically working alongside Mike Tenay, Bobby Heenan, Larry Zbyszko, and later with Mark Madden and Scott Hudson. Before the advent of \"Nitro\" and \"Thunder\", Schiavone, hosted \"WCW Saturday Night\" and \"WCW WorldWide\". He made an appearance in the movie \"Ready to Rumble\". When WCW's main assets were bought by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF/now WWE) in 2001, he was not retained by WWE.\n\nAn infamous incident involving Schiavone occurred on the January 4, 1999, \"Nitro\". \"Nitro\" was airing live against the pre-taped\" WWF Raw is War\" on USA Network and was to feature a rematch between WCW World Heavyweight Champion Kevin Nash and former champion Bill Goldberg from \"Starrcade\", where Nash had ended Goldberg's undefeated streak and taken his title under controversial circumstances. The \"Nitro\" episode was also the first appearance of \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan since he announced his \"retirement\" from professional wrestling on the Thanksgiving 1998 edition of \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". Meanwhile, \"Raw\" was to feature Mick Foley, who was wrestling as Mankind at the time and who had previously worked for WCW as Cactus Jack, winning his first WWF Championship in a match against The Rock. However, at the time \"Raw\" was taped while \"Nitro\" was live, and it was a practice for WCW and executive producer Eric Bischoff to spoil pre-taped \"Raw\" episodes, by telling the WCW audience the results of the Raw show, and not give fans reasons to change the channel.\n\nAccording to Foley, who wrote about the incident in the first chapter of his book \"Foley Is Good (and the Real World is Faker than Wrestling)\", this was to be a pivotal night for WCW as people believed that WCW, whose record streak of 84 consecutive Monday night wins in the ratings had been snapped by \"Raw\" in April 1998 and had only eight head-to-head wins after that, would turn the ratings tide back to them and potentially take over the lead in the Monday Night Wars. During the show Schiavone spoiled the result of \"Raw's\" main event by saying that Foley, the former Cactus Jack, would win, sarcastically remarking \"That's gonna put some butts in the seats\".\n\nFoley was genuinely upset by what he had heard and telephoned Schiavone to talk about it. When Schiavone called Foley back, he told Foley that Bischoff had ordered him to reveal Foley's title win over the air. The strategy, however, backfired on Bischoff. Almost immediately after Schiavone spoiled Foley's title win, 600,000 households switched from \"Nitro\" to \"Raw\", to watch Foley win the title. This was enough to give the WWF the ratings win for the night, with a 5.7 final rating to \"Nitro's\" 5.0. WCW's ratings never saw more than a 5.0 going head-to-head with \"Raw\" again and \"Nitro's\" rating sank below 5.0 and by the end of the year was struggling to stay above 3.0.\n\nIn 2003, Schiavone made an appearance in NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA: TNA, later Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) during one of their weekly pay-per-views. Schiavone interrupted an interview with Goldylocks and Percy Pringle and proceeded to cut a worked shoot promo in which he insulted both of them. Mike Tenay, TNA's lead broadcaster and Schiavone's former WCW colleague, then entered the ring and the two got into an argument over their careers and what happened during the last days of WCW, where both men lost their jobs. The promo ended when Vince Russo entered the ring and promised Schiavone a job with him. However, nothing ever came of that as Schiavone only made one more appearance in TNA.\n\nOn October 5, 2017, Schiavone returned to professional wrestling at the inaugural event of the resurrected Major League Wrestling (MLW). At the show, Schiavone provided color commentary for the event's matches. He has since continued to provide his commentary work for MLW's television show, \"MLW Fusion\". After taking a break in early 2019 from commentating due to conflicting schedules, he returned in July 2019.. Schiavone noted on the November 20, 2019 \"Clash of the Champions XIII\" episode of \"What Happened When\" with Conrad Thompson that he would no longer be appearing for Major League Wrestling (MLW).\n\nIn August 2019, it was reported that Schiavone had signed a contract with All Elite Wrestling. It is expected that Schiavone will continue to work with MLW while working for AEW. It was announced that Schiavone will be joining AEW as a commentator. Schiavone will also be working as a senior producer for AEW live events.\n\nOn March 25, 2020, due to significant delays with non-audiences, Schiavone filled in on play-by-play commentary for Jim Ross and Excalibur on \"AEW Dynamite\" with other substitute announcers Cody, Kenny Omega, Colt Cabana and Chris Jericho.\n\nAfter wrestling, Schiavone became the morning sports anchor for both WDUN in Gainesville and WSB-AM in Atlanta simultaneously, despite the two stations having different owners (WDUN has a partnership with Cox Media Group, which owns WSB-TV and WSB-AM.) Schiavone also has done morning sports reports for Cox sister stations WHIO AM/FM in Dayton, Ohio. Additionally, Schiavone is a writer for the Georgia Bulldogs Radio Network and produced the Best of the Bulldogs, which won the AP Award for Best Sports Program in 2004. Along with being a writer for the Georgia Bulldogs Radio Network, Schiavone also works one of the post game talk shows on the Georgia Bulldogs Radio Network for home and away games alongside former University of Georgia quarterback David Greene.\n\nAfter a few years of work with the Braves system including pre-game and post-game radio coverage, and also spot duty as an official scorer for games, Schiavone returned to play-by-play duties on radio when the Gwinnett Braves began their first season in Lawrenceville, Georgia as Atlanta's AAA-level affiliate for the 2009–10 season.\n\nOn January 30, 2017, Schiavone began hosting the \"What Happened When?\" podcast with co-host Conrad Thompson on MLW Radio discussing stories from Schiavone's time with Jim Crockett Promotions, his stint in the WWF and his WCW tenure. Schiavone also co-hosts the \"Pro Wrestling Wednesday\" podcast with lifelong wrestling fan Beau Le Blanc for WZGC FM 92.9 The Game in Atlanta, a station in which he often does fill-in work for their sports flash updates. On February 20, 2020, All Elite Wrestling and TNT launched \"AEW Unrestricted\", a weekly podcast hosted by Schiavone and referee Aubrey Edwards.\n\n\n"}

It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication and compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing. Video tracking can be a time-consuming process due to the amount of data that is contained in video. Adding further to the complexity is the possible need to use object recognition techniques for tracking, a challenging problem in its own right.\n\nThe objective of video tracking is to associate target objects in consecutive video frames. The association can be especially difficult when the objects are moving fast relative to the frame rate. Another situation that increases the complexity of the problem is when the tracked object changes orientation over time. For these situations video tracking systems usually employ a motion model which describes how the image of the target might change for different possible motions of the object.\n\nExamples of simple motion models are:\n\nTo perform video tracking an algorithm analyzes sequential video frames and outputs the movement of targets between the frames. There are a variety of algorithms, each having strengths and weaknesses. Considering the intended use is important when choosing which algorithm to use. There are two major components of a visual tracking system: target representation and localization, as well as filtering and data association.\n\n\"Target representation and localization\" is mostly a bottom-up process. These methods give a variety of tools for identifying the moving object. Locating and tracking the target object successfully is dependent on the algorithm. For example, using blob tracking is useful for identifying human movement because a person's profile changes dynamically. Typically the computational complexity for these algorithms is low. The following are some common \"target representation and localization\" algorithms:\n\n\n\"Filtering and data association\" is mostly a top-down process, which involves incorporating prior information about the scene or object, dealing with object dynamics, and evaluation of different hypotheses. These methods allow the tracking of complex objects along with more complex object interaction like tracking objects moving behind obstructions. Additionally the complexity is increased if the video tracker (also named TV tracker or target tracker) is not mounted on rigid foundation (on-shore) but on a moving ship (off-shore), where typically an inertial measurement system is used to pre-stabilize the video tracker to reduce the required dynamics and bandwidth of the camera system.\nThe computational complexity for these algorithms is usually much higher. The following are some common filtering algorithms:\n\n\n"}

Noting that the Great Western Railway 4500 and 4575 Classes of 2-6-2T ('Prairie') had been successful, George Ivatt designed the new engine type incorporating self-emptying ashpans and rocking grates which were labour-saving devices. A tender version, the Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 was also produced. The LMS classified them as 2P, but BR preferred the classification 2MT.\n\nThe class was introduced between 1946 and 1952. They were based on the LMS Stanier 2-6-2T which was, in turn, based on the LMS Fowler 2-6-2T. Ten were built by the LMS before nationalisation in 1948, and were numbered 1200–1209. British Railways added the prefix '4' to their numbers so they became 41200–41209. A further 120 were built by BR, numbers 41210–41329. Most were built at Crewe, including 41272 — the 7000th locomotive to be built there, but the last ten were built at Derby. Fifty engines were fitted with push-pull equipment, these being Nos. 41210–41229, 41270–41289 and 41320–41329.\n\nThe last thirty Crewe-built engines, 41290–41319, were allocated to the Southern Region from new. The rest were London Midland Region engines. Some were also allocated to the Western Region of BR in the 1950s and 1960s such as numbers 41202, 41203 and 41249 which were shedded at Bristol Bath Road in 1959. They spent their lives mostly on branch line work.\n\nThe design formed the basis for the BR standard class 2 2-6-2T (numbers 84000–29), which were built to a slightly smaller loading gauge and so have slanted cab sides. These engines also incorporate a fallplate and fittings common to many BR standard classes, such as the chimneys.\n\nIn 1957 No.41224 hauled the first train to pass along the old Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway since closure six years earlier, and the last before the track was dismantled. It was chartered by the Midland area of the Stephenson Locomotive Society and carried more than 220 railway enthusiasts.\n\nThe class were withdrawn between 1962 and 1967.\n\nFour have survived to preservation, these engines being: 41241, 41298, 41312 & 41313. All four members of the class have steamed in preservation with 41241 & 41312 working on the main line. 41241 appeared at the Rail 150 Cavalcade at Shildon in 1975 arriving at the event under its own power. It was also used on the Shildon shuttle trains during the event taking people from the main station at Shildon to the event and also between Darlington and Shildon. 41312 ran on the main line in the late 1990s/early 2000s. As of 2018 all four preserved engines are currently operational, the latest of them being 41241 which returned to service from an overhaul in June during the KWVR's 50th anniversary steam gala.\n\nNo.41241 is particularly associated with the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway and when initially preserved was painted in a fictitious maroon livery with K&WVR on the tanks, though it was later restored to more conventional BR black.\n\nDuring October 2006, the Ivatt Trust loaned the unrestored no. 41313 to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. In October 2014, it was announced that the engine will be moved to the East Somerset Railway for overhaul. No 41298 was also moved to the Isle of Wight, and ownership of both these locos was transferred to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. These locomotives required conversion/fitment of air braking alongside the vacuum brakes as the rolling stock on the island is air-braked. All of the engines apart from 41241 wear authentic British Railways lined black livery with the later BR crest. 41241 presently wears the livery that it wore when the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway was opened in 1968, at the time it wasnt able to wear BR colours.\n\nBachmann produced a 00 gauge model in various liveries. Dapol have released a model in British N gauge.\n\nArthur from Thomas & Friends is based on this class.\n\n"}

Together with Isaac Levitan, he helped create what came to be known as the \"Landscape of Mood\".\n\nHis father was a Troop Sergeant in the Don Cossacks. He displayed artistic talent at an early age; copying illustrations from \"Niva\" and other popular magazines. His uncle, a local artist named A.V. Pyshkin, taught him how to draw from memory. His father insisted that he follow family tradition, however, and enrolled him in the in 1870. Once there, his instructors noticed that he spent all of his free time drawing and advised his father to give him an art education instead.\n\nIn 1877, after receiving his father's permission, he began auditing classes at the Imperial Academy of Arts, then became a student of the landscape painter Mikhail Clodt. Upon graduating in 1881, he was apparently displeased with his instruction at the Academy and refused to participate in the customary competition for a gold medal. He chose to exhibit at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts instead, winning several medals and achieving his first public recognition. In 1884 his painting, \"Winter\" was acquired by the Tretyakov Gallery. Following that, he began to exhibit regularly with the Peredvizhniki and became a member in 1886.\n\nIn 1887, Ilya Repin invited him to stay at his estate in Siversky, where he painted en plein air and came under Repin's influence. The year 1888 found him touring the Black Sea coast in Georgia on horseback with his friend, Nikolai Yaroshenko. In 1890, his painting \"Притихло\" (\"hushing\" or \"silencing\", before the storm) was purchased by Tsar Alexander III for his collection at the Winter Palace.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1900, he travelled extensively, visiting the Azov Sea, the Volga Region and the Caucasus as well as locations abroad, ranging from Turkey to France and Italy to Germany. In 1897, upon the dismissal of Arkhip Kuindzhi, he was offered a position as Professor of Landscape Painting at the Imperial Academy, but refused the offer.\n\nAfter his friend Yaroshenko's death in 1898, he became one of the leaders of the Peredvizhniki and was known as a moderating force when the newer members had disagreements with the older ones. During this period, he was increasingly influenced by French Impressionism. Later in 1898, despite his refusal to accept a position there, he was named an \"Academician\" by the Imperial Academy and became a full member in 1900.\n\nHe began teaching there in 1908 and, following the death of Alexander Kiselyov in 1911, became head of the landscape painting workshop. An effort to build a special museum for his works had to be halted due to the outbreak of World War I and was never resumed. In 1915, he became a member of the Academy's governing council. During this time, he also hosted a Tuesday \"Salon\", which was attended by notable figures from the scientific community, as well as by artists, writers and musicians. Ivan Pavlov became a close friend.\n\nIn 1918, he died of heart failure and Pavlov delivered one of the funeral orations. During the Soviet era, except for one exhibition in 1938, he was largely forgotten. A street in Novocherkassk was later named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

Parliamentary elections are held every four years, the most recent in 2019.\n\nThe executive power is exercised by the government \"(Qeveria)\", presided over by the Prime Minister. Legislative power is vested in both the executive and the parliament \"(Kuvendi)\". The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe Executive of Kosovo is the collection of Kosovo institutions that exercises executive authority in Kosovo. It is headed by the Prime Minister of Kosovo, and also includes the prime minister, the deputy prime ministers, and various ministers. The President of Kosovo also plays a role.\n\nAlbin Kurti is the Prime Minister of Kosovo and head of government. Hashim Thaçi is the President of Kosovo and head of state. The ruling parties in Kosovo are Vetëvendosje (LVV), Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).\n\n2019 Elections in Kosovo\n\nThe Assembly of Kosovo \"(Kuvendi i Kosovës)\" has 120 members elected for a four-year term. According to the Constitution, Kosovo shall have an Assembly consisting of 120 members. It includes twenty reserved seats which are ten for Kosovar Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (e.g., Bosniak, Roma, etc.). Kosovo has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.\n\nThe Assembly passes all laws in Kosovo, ratifies international treaties, appoints the President, Prime Minister, ministers, and justices of all courts, adopts the budget and performs other duties as established by the Constitution. The Parliament can pass a vote of no-confidence on the Government by a majority of the members.\n\nThe Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963) was established in 1945 as an autonomous entity within the People's Republic of Serbia. Under the 1974 constitution, Kosovo obtained extensive autonomy, and became one of the subjects of the Yugoslav federation.\n\nOn 5 July 1989 this extensive autonomy was largely revoked by Slobodan Milošević's administration and the amount of autonomy of Kosovo had been restored to its pre-1974 status. On 28 September 1990, the name of the province was reverted to Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.\n\nIn 1990, Kosovo was declared independent by the ethnic Albanian politicians and was recognised by Albania. The name of the entity was \"Republic of Kosova\". A period of fighting ensued between Kosovan Albanians and Yugoslav security forces resulting in a humanitarian crisis. In 1999, the United Nations placed Kosovo under their administration in the aftermath of the War in Kosovo. Under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was established on 10 June 1999, which maintained how the Province of Kosovo functioned. UNSCR 1244 called for a political process to determine the future status of Kosovo; UN-sponsored negotiations began in 2006 (see Kosovo status process).\n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted UNMIK with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 gave Yugoslavia no role in governing Kosovo and from 1999, national laws and institutions were not valid in Kosovo. The resolution recognised Yugoslav sovereignty of Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment. \nIn May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG). After 2001, UNMIK gradually transferred increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers such as foreign affairs. Kosovo also established municipal governments and an internationally supervised Kosovo Police Service.\n\nThe largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement against Milošević's rule. The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006. The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaçi and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj. Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named \"Ora.\" Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken seats in the Kosovo Assembly. \nIn November 2001, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly. After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected Ibrahim Rugova as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.\n\nAfter Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in Ramush Haradinaj (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption. \nRamush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005. He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK). But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander Agim Çeku. Çeku won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia was critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claimed he was not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs. A Serbian court had indicted Çeku for war crimes he committed in Kosovo. The Kosovo Assembly elected Fatmir Sejdiu, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. Slaviša Petković, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations of corruption at his ministry.\n\nOn 10 February 2007, nearly 3,000 people protested against the plan by United Nations chief negotiator Martti Ahtisaari which would in effect grant independence to the Kosovo province. Some militant ethnic Albanian groups, like Vetevendosje (Self-determination) that led the Saturday ethnic Albanian protests in Pristina, opposed UN sponsored talks and wanted the Kosovo parliament to declare independence immediately. On Tuesday 13 February 2007, Kosovo interior minister Fatmir Rexhepi resigned on moral grounds after two people died of injuries suffered in clashes with police during the protest. There was no involvement of Kosovo police in the protests, as the clashes were with the UNMIK police. Rexhepi remains as the only politician in Kosovo to have resigned on moral grounds.\n\nElections were held in Kosovo on 17 November 2007. After early results on the morning of the 18th indicating opposition leader Hashim Thaçi was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, he claimed victory for PDK, the Albanian Democratic Party, and stated his intention to declare independence. President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League was in second place with 22 percent of the vote. The turnout at the election was particularly low with most Serbs refusing to vote. \nOn 25 December 2007 it was announced Thaçi's Democratic Party of Kosovo would form a coalition with President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League forming a slight majority of 62 seats out of 120. Thaçi's government will include 7 ministers from his party, 5 ministers from LDK and 3 ministers from non-Albanian communities.\n\nFollowing years of failed negotiations on the status of Kosovo in Serbia, Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi announced on 16 February 2008 that the Assembly of Kosovo would declare independence the following day, 17 February 2008 at 17:00h. The independent Republic of Kosovo has since been recognised by several states.\n\n\n"}

It is known by the common names Indian python, black-tailed python, Indian rock python, and Asian rock python. It is generally lighter colored than the Burmese python and reaches usually .\n\nThe rock python's color pattern is whitish or yellowish with the blotched patterns varying from tan to dark brown shades. This varies with terrain and habitat. Specimens from the hill forests of Western Ghats and Assam are darker, while those from the Deccan Plateau and Eastern Ghats are usually lighter.\n\nThe nominate subspecies occurring in India typically grows to . This value is supported by a 1990 study in Keoladeo National Park, where 25% of the python population was long. Two individuals even measured nearly .\n\nBecause of confusion with the Burmese python, exaggerations, and stretched skins in the past, the maximum length of this subspecies is difficult to tell. The longest scientifically recorded specimen, collected in Pakistan, was long and weighed . In Pakistan, Indian pythons commonly reach a length of .\n\n\"P. molurus\" occurs in India, southern Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and probably in the north of Myanmar. It lives in a wide range of habitats, including grasslands, swamps, marshes, rocky foothills, woodlands, open forest, and river valleys. It needs a permanent source of water. It hides in abandoned mammal burrows, hollow trees, dense water reeds, and mangrove thickets.\n\nLethargic and slow moving even in their native habitat, they exhibit timidity and rarely try to attack even when attacked. Locomotion is usually with the body moving in a straight line, by \"walking on its ribs\". They are excellent swimmers and are quite at home in water. They can be wholly submerged in water for many minutes if necessary, but usually prefer to remain near the bank.\n\nLike all snakes, Indian pythons are strict carnivores and feed on mammals, birds, and reptiles indiscriminately, but seem to prefer mammals. Roused to activity on sighting prey, the snake advances with a quivering tail and lunges with an open mouth. Live prey is constricted and killed. One or two coils are used to hold it in a tight grip. The prey, unable to breathe, succumbs and is subsequently swallowed head first. After a heavy meal, they are disinclined to move. If forced to, hard parts of the meal may tear through the body. Therefore, if disturbed, some specimens disgorge their meal to escape from potential predators. After a heavy meal, an individual may fast for weeks, the longest recorded duration being 2 years. The python can swallow prey bigger than its diameter because the jaw bones are not connected. Moreover, prey cannot escape from its mouth because of the arrangement of the teeth (which are reverse saw-like).\n\nOviparous, up to 100 eggs are laid by a female, which she protects and incubates. Towards this end, they are capable of raising their body temperature above the ambient level through muscular contractions. The hatchlings are in length and grow quickly. An artificial incubation method using climate-controlled environmental chambers was developed in India for successfully raising hatchlings from abandoned or unattended eggs.\n\nThe Indian python is classified as lower risk/near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v2.3, 1996). This listing indicates that it may become threatened with extinction and is in need of frequent reassessment.\n\nIn the literature, one other subspecies may be encountered: \"P. m. pimbura\" Deraniyagala, 1945, which is found in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Burmese python (\"Python bivittatus\") was referred to as a subspecies of the Indian python until 2009, when it was elevated to full species status. The name \"Python molurus bivittatus\" is found in older literature.\n\nKaa, a large and young Indian python, is featured in \"The Jungle Book\".\n\n"}

Wrestling under the ring name Angel, Angel formed a stable known as \"Da Baldies\" (apparently based on a real NY skinhead gang) with Vito LoGrasso, Tony DeVito, Vic Grimes, P.N. News and Redd Dogg. The Baldies feuded with New Jack throughout late 1999 and early 2000 over who was the \"King of the Streets\". This feud saw Angel defeat New Jack at the Guilty As Charged 2000 pay per view, proclaiming himself the King of the Streets, until he and New Jack faced off again in late 2000, with Jack winning, and 'reclaiming' the title.

He studied theology but never entered the active ministry. Instead, he became a school teacher in Kingston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1774, Partridge was elected as a delegate to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, a provisional government formed to replace the Massachusetts General Court which had been suspended by Royal Governor Gen. Thomas Gage. Of the first meeting of the Provincial Congress, Partridge wrote:\n\nGen. Gage said he had come over with his troops and proclamations to frighten us rebels into submission! We soon had his mandate, dissolving the General Court ... So we met [in Salem]. And in a short time we began to ask one another, What can we do? The worst must come to the worst! ... Shall we submit to Great Britain? ... Or shall we resist her encroachments to the point of the sword? ... The gulf is passed. We will have a Congress at Concord. We will send letters to all the colonies and urge them to send delegates to meet at Philadelphia ... We will go to our homes and wake everyone that sleeps!\n\nPartridge then served with the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1775 to 1779. In 1779 the legislature named him a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was reappointed continuously until 1785, although he missed the session held in Princeton, New Jersey in 1783. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.\n\nWhen the new government of the United States was installed Partridge was elected to the First United States Congress as a representative of .

This led to the establishment of Patridge Academy which was built on Tremont Street in Duxbury in 1844. The Academy served as the town's only secondary school until the construction of the first Duxbury High School in 1927.

A high-heeled version was worn by Athenian tragic actors (to make them look taller). It was also worn by hunters, and soldiers in Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman societies, to protect the lower legs against thorns, dirt, etc.\nThe word buskin, only recorded in English since 1503 meaning \"half boot\", is of unknown origin, perhaps from Old French \"brousequin\" (in modern French \"brodequin\") or directly from its Middle Dutch model \"brosekin\" \"small leather boot\". Figurative senses relating to tragedy are from the word being used (since 1570) to translate Greek kothornos () or Latin cothurnus, the high, thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy; contrasted with sock (from Latin soccus), the low shoe worn by comedians.\n\nByzantine emperors were formally clad in purple buskins, embroidered in gold with double-headed eagles.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, buskins are ceremonial liturgical stockings (\"caligae\" in Latin) of silk, sometimes interwoven with gold threads and even heavily embroidered, formerly worn by the celebrant of a pontifical Mass. The buskins can be worn over the episcopal sandals, regular dress socks with regular dress shoes, or over the red papal shoes worn by the Pope.\n\nOriginally liturgical buskins were worn by all priests, until about the eighth century when they were reserved for the exclusive use of bishops as part of the pontificalia, i.e. episcopal \"regalia\", a privilege in modern times extended to some lesser prelates. In liturgical colour they correspond to the chasuble, but are never worn with black.\n"}

He joined the Finnish power metal band Sonata Arctica in late 2002 and currently resides in Kemi, Finland, when not on tour.\n\nKeyboardists he has listed as his favourites include Kevin Moore, Jon Lord, Jens Johansson and Matt Guillory. He claims that his musical inspiration is taken from life itself.\n\nAlthough his main involvement is with Sonata Arctica, he is also a member of the band Silent Voices and a thrash/groove metal band called Mental Care Foundation (in which he is the vocalist rather than the keyboardist). He has also recently started a melodic death metal side project called Graveyard Shift as vocalist with his former Sonata Arctica bandmate Jani Liimatainen.\n\nBefore joining Sonata Arctica, he had participated in a large enough number of bands that he does not list on his bio page on the official Sonata Arctica website. His most well-known previous band was a progressive power metal band called Requiem, with whom he recorded two albums and contributed keyboards.\n\nHenrik plays a shoulder-mounted controller keyboard (formerly the Roland AX-1, then the Roland AX-7, then AX-1 again and now the Roland AX-Synth) and a Kurzweil, Korg KARMA or Korg Triton synthesizer. Recently he started to use Korg M3 instead of the Korg Karma. August 2009 in Lowlands his gear was just painted Roland AX-1 and Korg M3 and no racks. This seems to be his live gear from now on. He is endorsed by Korg and Roland (updated 16 September 2009) On a European leg of 2009 Henkka started using new Roland AX-Synth (painted violet) instead of his old AX-1 (updated 24 December 2009).\n\nIn February 2012 he released his first solo album, \"...And the Weird Turned Pro\", in which fellow Sonata Arctica bandmates Elias Viljanen and Pasi Kauppinen play the guitar and the bass, respectively (though Kauppinen was still not a member of the band). They are also joined by Finnish drummer Jari Huttunen.\n\nSonata Arctica chose Klingenberg to join after spending time drinking with him and another candidate, since they wanted the newcomer to fit in with the other band members' socially as well as musically.\n\nDuring live shows, Henrik's keytar allows him to add more energy and movement to the band's performances and he often wanders the stage whilst playing, in the same way that guitarists often do. On the Sonata Arctica live DVD \"For the Sake of Revenge\", Henrik smashed his hand painted Roland AX-7 several times into the floor of the stage in an event that was referred to as 'The End of this Keyboard' (a reference to the band's song 'The End of this Chapter'). This act mirrored the instrument-destroying antics of The Who as well as being a cliché of rock and metal music and it showed Henrik to be a more traditional rock or metal performer.\n\nIn the documentary \"Men of the North in the Land of the Rising Sun\", Henrik is shown wearing a traffic cone on his head, which has become a trademark of sorts for fans.\n\n"}

In the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines South Course, he finished runner-up after losing the first sudden death hole after an 18-hole playoff to Tiger Woods. In 2016, Mediate won the Senior PGA Championship, one of the five senior majors. \n\nMediate was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. According to the Golf Channel, he is the son of a barber and has Italian ancestral heritage. Mediate attended Hempfield Area High School. When he attended Florida Southern College, he was a member of the golf team. His close friend Lee Janzen, another PGA Tour pro, also played there. They helped lead Florida Southern to the 1985 Division II national team championship.\n\nMediate turned professional in 1985. His golfing career has been marred by back trouble. Early on, he compensated by using a long putter. In 1991 he became the first player to win on the PGA Tour using a long putter when he won the Doral-Ryder Open. He picked up another victory at the 1993 KMart Greater Greensboro Open, but he then had a long layoff due to a ruptured disk. He underwent major back surgery in 1999, but lost practically five years of his career. Back pain returned in 2004 and later nearly ended his career.\n\nMediate returned to the Tour in 1996 playing under a special medical extension and performed steadily. He picked up wins on the Tour in 1999, 2000 and 2002. After improving his fitness to minimize his back problems, he returned to using a conventional putter in 2003.\n\nMediate has been featured in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Ranking and considered to be one of the best putters in golf. At the 2006 Masters, Mediate was in contention to win the event on the final day until he took a septuple-bogey ten on the par three 12th hole. His best finish in a major championship was a second place showing at the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines South Course. Tied with Tiger Woods at -1 after regular tournament play, then tied again at even par through the 18 hole playoff, Woods finally bested Mediate on the first hole (hole #7) of sudden death, the 91st hole of the tournament. It was only the third time a U.S. Open playoff had gone to sudden death. Mediate's performance gained him 111 spots in the world golf rankings, moving him from 158th to 47th place.\n\nMediate earned his first win since 2002 at the 2010 Frys.com Open by beating Bo Van Pelt and Alex Prugh by one shot. During the tournament, Mediate holed out all four days. He started on Thursday, with a hole-in-one on the 189 yard par-3 3rd hole. On Friday, he holed out from 160 yards on the par-4 4th hole for an eagle, followed on Saturday with a hole-out from 111 yards on the par-5 15th hole, also for eagle. On Sunday, he was tied for the lead on the 17th hole when he holed from 116 yards for eagle to take a two shot lead. He parred the 18th to win the tournament. He also became the oldest wire-to-wire winner on the PGA Tour since at least 1970.\n\nMediate has PGA Tour career earnings of over $16 million.\n\nMediate joined the Champions Tour for 2013 after turning 50 and his exemption for his 2010 PGA Tour win ended. He won in his debut at the Allianz Championship, the 16th Champions Tour player to do so. After shooting a 61 in the second round, he claimed victory by two strokes over Bernhard Langer and Tom Pernice, Jr. with a birdie at the last hole. He won his second Champions Tour tournament that September, at the Shaw Charity Classic. Mediate finished seven strokes ahead of runner-up, Tom Byrum.\n\nIn May 2016, Mediate won his first senior major championship at the Senior PGA Championship, with a three stroke victory over the defending champion Colin Montgomerie. His winning total of 265 (−19) broke the previous record by three and was the first wire-to-wire victory at the event since Jack Nicklaus in 1991. His victory was sealed when he holed out from a greenside bunker on the 71st hole of regulation play for birdie.\n\nOn September 22, 2019, Mediate won the Sanford International on the PGA Tour Champions in South Dakota.\n\nOn October 9, 2006, it was announced that Mediate would become an on-course reporter for The Golf Channel's 2007 PGA Tour coverage.\n\nMediate played in the 2005 World Series of Poker's , as well as the 2001 Blem Classic of Las Vegas.\n\nMediate is a distant cousin of Puerto Rico Islanders soccer player Domenic Mediate.\n\nPGA Tour playoff record (2–1)\n\nCUT = missed the half-way cut<br>\nWD = Withdrew<br>\n\"T\" = tied\n\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nCancelled due to 9/11<br>\n\nQF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play<br>\nWD = Withdrew<br>\n\"T\" = tied<br>\nNT = No Tournament\n\n\"Results are not in chronological order before 2017.\"\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut<br>\nWD = withdrew<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though her early training focused on classical music, in junior high school she developed an interest in jazz and began composing her own music.\n\nShe studied children's culture at , then studied at the Yamaha Music Foundation. She started the band Cosmos, which recorded four albums. She recorded her debut solo album, \"A Drop of Water\" (Passport, 1987), with her husband Kazu Matsui. She signed with MCA and released the albums \"No Borders\" and \"Under Northern Lights\". In 1992 she signed with White Cat. \"Sapphire\" (1995) reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" magazine Contemporary Jazz chart.\n\nShe produced her album \"The Road\" (Shanachie, 2011) and recorded it with Richard Bona, Vinnie Colaiuta, Jackiem Joyner, and Kirk Whalum.

She believes that music has a power to bring people together and change their lives. \"We are connected by music\", Matsui wrote, \"as the Ocean connects the continents\".\n\nA lover of nature, Matsui often makes reference to plants, animals, the elements, and other natural features and phenomena in her song titles. She shows a special fascination with the moon as a number of her compositions refer to the moon in their titles.\n\nHer 1997 mini-CD \"A Gift of Hope\" went to support the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization, and her music appeared in a \"Lifetime\" channel special about breast cancer. She performed at an ice skating event in 1997 to support the Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Proceeds from \"A Gift of Life\" went to the National Marrow Donor Program and the Marrow Foundation to help Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, which promotes the registration of people of ethnic minorities as marrow donors to improve their chances of finding a matching donor. Royalties from her album \"Wildflower\" supported the United Nations World Food Programme. She performed at the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City on December 17, 2003, to benefit the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

John Llewelyn of Penllergaer and Ynysygerwn. His sister, Mary Dillwyn (1816–1906), is remembered as the earliest female photographer in Wales. Upon coming of age he inherited his maternal grandfather John Llewelyn's estates of Penllergaer and Ynysygerwn, near Swansea, and assumed the additional surname of Llewelyn. Educated privately, he met through his father (a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Linnean Society, and at one time a member of Parliament) many of the eminent men of his time. These included Sir David Brewster, Michael Faraday and Charles Wheatstone. His father Lewis Weston Dillwyn had been sent to Swansea in 1803 by Lewis' father William to take over the management of the Cambrian Pottery. \nIn 1833 he married Emma Thomasina Talbot, daughter of Thomas Mansel Talbot and Lady Mary Lucy, née Fox Strangways, the younger daughter of the Earl & Countess of Ilchester. Thomas was related to William Davenport Talbot and Mary was the sister of Elisabeth Talbot, the parents of William Henry Fox Talbot. Henry Talbot, through his botanic interests was a friend of Lewis Weston Dillwyn and spent some of his teenage years at Penrice, the home of the Welsh Talbots, also visiting Penllergaer.\n\nIn 1835 he served as High Sheriff of Glamorgan.\n\nIn January 1839, following the announcements of photographic processes by both William Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre, Llewelyn, with the encouragement of Henry Talbot, began to experiment himself. He tried all the processes available. His earliest daguerreotype is dated 1840. A few of his early photogenic drawings have survived, including some cliché verre, dated 1839. Some thousand calotype and wet collodion negatives still exist together with albums in private and public collections and retained by the family. \nWhen the Royal Photographic Society was founded in 1853, Llewelyn was one of those who attended the foundation meeting at the Society of Arts in London, and was, for some years, a founder Council member. It was suggested at one time that he become country vice-president, but nothing seems to have come of that idea. He exhibited regularly in the early exhibitions of the Society as well as in Dundee, the Manchester Art Treasures exhibition and Paris exhibition in 1855. At this latter exhibition he was amongst those awarded a silver medal for his 'Motion' series. \nIn 1856 he announced his own oxymel process which allowed collodion negatives to be preserved over many days. This was hailed as a boon by the Illustrated London News of July 1856. They wrote \"\"We have heard of a new method of preserving collodion plates for a week or a fortnight discovered by Mr Llewelyn of Penllergare a gentleman to whom all photographers owe a world of thanks. The plates may be prepared at home and a boxful taken out and think of this ye tourists, as you travel along and a fine prospect meets your eye you have nothing to do but to stop your carriage, get out your camera, and in a few minutes you may secure a picture, drawn by Nature herself, that would have taken you hours to sketch...\"\"\n\nHe also took a number of stereo images using a camera he bought for his daughter Thereza's birthday in 1856. \nHis last images would appear to date from the end of the 1850s after which it is possible that his health prevented any further photographic activity. He never took his camera outside Britain, though the family frequently visited mainland Europe. The majority of his images were taken around his estate of Penllergare, near Swansea, and around the Welsh coast. There are also a number taken in Cornwall over several years, many in Bristol including some pioneer animal and bird images in Clifton Zoo, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and a few in Scotland. His circle of photographic friends included Philip Henry Delamotte, Robert Hunt, Hugh Welch Diamond and especially his distant relative Calvert Richard Jones. Anecdotal diary references tell us that, in the 1840s, he was with his friend Antoine Claudet, conducting experiments on the daguerreotype process. It has been suggested that they were probably relating to the speed of exposure of the plate.\nThough he never published any photographic books, he did contribute to The Sunbeam edited by his friend Philip Henry Delamotte and other books. One book by Llewelyn that was scheduled for publication was \"Pictures of Welsh Scenery\" to be published by Joseph Cundall of Bond Street, in 1854. In \"The Practice of Photography\" published in 1853 written by Philip Delamotte (or Philip H De la Motte as the publication states) an advertisement in the back announced: \"Now ready, price 16s ... \"Series of Photographic Pictures of Welsh Scenery\" by J D Llewelyn. Published in parts 10s 6d each.\" The book appears not to have been published for some unknown reason and there are no references to it in surviving letters either.\n\nLlewelyn had many scientific and technological interests beyond photography. He built a botanical collection. He assisted Charles Wheatstone with the first ever experiments in sub-marine telegraphy, off the Mumbles, South Wales. He demonstrated a model boat powered with an electrical motor on the ornamental lake on his estate. He created the first private orchid house to replicate the original conditions of the plants in the South American jungles, heated with steam, complete with a heated waterfall.\n\nLlewelyn had an interest in astronomy. He built a stone observatory on the estate for the use of his daughter Thereza, starting construction in 1851. The observatory housed a 4¾-inch aperture refracting telescope on an equatorial mount.\n\nLlewelyn moved to London in 1879 and died on 24 August 1882 at his home, Atherton Grange, in Wimbledon. Emma had died the previous year and both are buried at Penllergaer Church, originally built by Llewelyn for his family and estate workers. Their eldest son John Talbot Dillwyn Llewellyn became High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1878, mayor of Swansea in 1891, and M.P. for Swansea, 1895–1900 and was created a baronet in 1890 .\nLlewelyn's ancestors were both Welsh and American. His great-great-grandfather, William Dillwyn, had emigrated to North America in the 17th century as a persecuted Quaker, and was granted land by William Penn and some descendants of William still live in the USA; the Parrish Art Gallery and Museum, on Long Island being founded by one of them. Another descendant was the American painter Maxfield Parrish.\n\nA brief explanation of the different spellings of Penllergare/gaer is of interest. At the time of John Dillwyn Llewelyn's ownership of the estate, it was, and still is on the estate office seal, spelled Penllergare. The former village of Cors Einon later changed its name to Penllergaer, and the modern village of Gorseinon is now located a few miles away.\n\nA restoration project is currently taking place at Penllergaer today by the Penllergare Trust. Guided by the unique archive of John Dillwyn Llewelyn's mid-nineteenth century photography, the upper lake will be de-silted, and steps, terraces, waterfalls and cascades will be repaired and restored to reinstate the picturesque and romantic design. The stone arched Llewelyn Bridge has now been completed; perhaps the only bridge of its type to be built in Britain in decades.\nThe descendants of John Dillwyn Llewelyn are selling the estate piecemeal for housing developments.\n\nLlewelyn's work is held in the following public collection:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2032384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032384", "title": "Intercity bus service", "text": "Intercity bus service\n\nAn intercity bus service (North American English) or intercity coach service (British English and Commonwealth English), also called a long-distance, express, over-the-road, commercial, long-haul, or highway bus or coach service, is a public transport service using coaches to carry passengers significant distances between different cities, towns, or other populated areas. Unlike a transit bus service, which has frequent stops throughout a city or town, an intercity bus service generally has a single stop at one location in or near a city, and travels long distances without stopping at all. Intercity bus services may be operated by government agencies or private industry, for profit and not for profit. Intercity coach travel can serve areas or countries with no train services, or may be set up to compete with trains by providing a more flexible or cheaper alternative.\n\nIntercity bus services are of prime importance in lightly populated rural areas that often have little or no public transportation.\n\nIntercity bus services are one of four common transport methods between cities, not all of which are available in all places. The others are by airliner, train, and private automobile.\n\nThe first intercity scheduled transport service was called the stagecoach and originated in the 17th century. Crude coaches were being built from the 16th century in England, but without suspension, these coaches achieved very low speeds on the poor quality rutted roads of the time. By the mid 17th century, a basic stagecoach infrastructure was being put in place. The first stagecoach route started in 1610 and ran from Edinburgh to Leith. This was followed by a steady proliferation of other routes around the country.\n\nA string of coaching inns operated as stopping points for travellers on the route between London and Liverpool by the mid 17th century. The coach would depart every Monday and Thursday and took roughly ten days to make the journey during the summer months. They also became widely adopted for travel in and around London by mid-century and generally travelled at a few miles per hour. Shakespeare's first plays were staged at coaching inns such as The George Inn, Southwark.\nThe speed of travel remained constant until the mid-18th century. Reforms of the turnpike trusts, new methods of road building and the improved construction of coaches all led to a sustained rise in the comfort and speed of the average journey—from an average journey length of 2 days for the Cambridge-London route in 1750 to a length of under 7 hours in 1820. Robert Hooke helped in the construction of some of the first spring-suspended coaches in the 1660s and spoked wheels with iron rim brakes were introduced, improving the characteristics of the coach.\n\nIn 1754, a Manchester-based company began a new service called the \"Flying Coach\". It was advertised with the following announcement: \"However incredible it may appear, this coach will actually (barring accidents) arrive in London in four days and a half after leaving Manchester.\" A similar service was begun from Liverpool three years later, using coaches with steel spring suspension. This coach took an unprecedented three days to reach London with an average speed of eight miles per hour.\nEven more dramatic improvements to coach speed were made by John Palmer at the British Post Office, who commissioned a fleet of mail coaches to deliver the post across the country. His experimental coach left Bristol at 4 pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later.\n\nThe golden age of the stagecoach was during the Regency period, from 1800 to 1830. The era saw great improvements in the design of the coaches, notably by John Besant in 1792 and 1795. His coach had a greatly improved turning capacity and braking system, and a novel feature that prevented the wheels from falling off while the coach was in motion. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle. Each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs attached to the axles.\n\nSteady improvements in road construction were also made at this time, most importantly the widespread implementation of Macadam roads up and down the country. Coaches in this period travelled at around 12 miles per hour and greatly increased the level of mobility in the country, both for people and for mail. Each route had an average of four coaches operating on it at one time - two for both directions and a further two spares in case of a breakdown en route.\n\nThe development of railways in the 1830s spelt the end for the stagecoaches across Europe and America, with only a few companies surviving to provide services for short journeys and excursions until the early years of the 20th century.\n\nThe first motor coaches were acquired by operators of those horse-drawn vehicles. W. C. Standerwick of Blackpool, England acquired its first motor charabanc in 1911, and Royal Blue from Bournemouth acquired its first motor charabanc in 1913. Motor coaches were initially used only for excursions.\n\nIn 1919, Royal Blue took advantage of a rail strike to run a coach service from Bournemouth to London. The service was so successful that it expanded rapidly. In 1920 the Minister of Transport Eric Campbell Geddes was quoted in Punch magazine as saying \"I think it would be a calamity if we did anything to prevent the economic use of charabancs\" and expressed concern at the problems caused to small charabanc and omnibus operators in parliament.\n\nIn America, Carl Eric Wickman began providing the first service in 1913. Frustrated about being unable to sell a seven-passenger automobile on the showroom floor of the dealership where he worked, he purchased the vehicle himself and started using it to transport miners between Hibbing and Alice, Minnesota. He began providing this service regularly in what would start a new company and industry. The company would one day be known as Greyhound.\n\nIn 1914, Pennsylvania was the first state to pass regulations for bus service in order to prevent monopolies of the industry from forming. All remaining U.S. states would soon follow.\n\nThe coach industry expanded rapidly in the 1920s, a period of intense competition. The Road Traffic Act 1930 in the UK introduced a national system of regulation of passenger road transport and authorised local authorities to operate transport services. It also imposed a speed limit of 30 mph for coaches whilst removing any speed limit for private cars.\n\nThe 1930s to the 1950s saw the development of bus stations for intercity transport. Many expanded from simple stops into major architecturally designed terminals that included shopping and other businesses. Intercity bus transport increased in speed, efficiency and popularity until the 1950s and 1960s, when as the popularity of the private automobile has increased, the use of intercity bus service has declined. For example, in Canada in the 1950s, 120 million passengers boarded intercity bus service each year; in the 1960s, this number declined to 50 million. During the 1990s, it was down to 10 million.\n\nIntercity buses, as they hold passengers for significant periods of time on long journeys, are designed for comfort. A sleeper bus is an example of a vehicle with optimum amenity for the longest travel times.\n\nAn intercity coach service may depart from a bus station with facilities for travellers or from a simple roadside bus stop. A coachway interchange is a term (in the United Kingdom) for a stopping place on the edge of a town, with connecting local transport. Park and ride facilities allow passengers to begin or complete their journeys by automobile. Intercity bus routes may follow a direct highway or freeway/motorway for shortest journey times, or travel via a scenic route for the enjoyment of passengers.\n\nIntercity buses may run less frequently and with fewer stops than a transit bus service. One common arrangement is to have several stops at the beginning of the trip, and several near the end, with the majority of the trip non-stop on a highway. Some stops may have service restrictions, such as \"boarding only\" (also called \"pickup only\") and \"discharge only\" (also called \"set-down only\"). Routes aimed at commuters may have most or all scheduled trips in the morning heading to an urban central business district, with trips in the evening mainly heading toward suburbs.\n\nIntercity coaches may also be used to supplement or replace another transport service, for example when a train or airline route is not in service.\n\nStatistically, intercity bus service is considered to be a very safe mode of transportation. For example, in the United States there are about 0.5 fatalities per 100 million passenger miles traveled according to the National Safety Council.\n\nWhen accidents do occur, the large passenger capacity of buses means accidents are disastrous in their magnitude. For example, the Kempsey bus crash in Australia on 22 December 1989 involved two full tourist coaches, each travelling at 100 km/h, colliding head-on: 35 people died and 41 were injured.\n\nIntercity coach service is very popular on routes to smaller urban centres not served by Via Rail as well as in areas like the Corridor, especially amongst students, where large operators like Megabus, Greyhound Canada, and Coach Canada operate very frequent services. Other major operators in the corridor include Voyageur, Intercar, Limocar, and others. Intercity express coaches (and trains) are operated by GO Transit as part of the Greater Toronto region's public transport system. Ontario Northland operates a bus service from Toronto to the Hudson and James Bay frontiers at the extreme north of the province. Many smaller and more specifically-oriented carriers operate in northern portions of the provinces away from train lines, such as to Abitibi-Témiscamingue in Quebec. In the Maritime Provinces, intercity buses are operated by Maritime Bus. In July 2018, Greyhound Canada announced the suspension of services in Western Canada with the exception of the Vancouver, BC to Seattle Service operated by its American sister company. In 2018, some of Greyhound Canada operations in Western Canada have been taken over by E-Bus, the BC Connector operated by the Wilson's Group and Rider's Express. The BC Provincial government provides a subsidized service from Prince George, BC to Valemount, Fort Nelson and Prince Rupert under the BCBusNorth brand.\n\nIn 2012, cuts to service were announced by Greyhound Canada in Alberta at the same time that Acadian Coach Lines announced its pending closure in Atlantic Canada.\n\nMontreal has a recent new coach terminal, the Gare d'autocars de Montréal\n\nThere are now plans, in Toronto, to construct a new GO Bus terminal with a new intercity coach terminal integrated, connected to Union Station.\n\nIn relatively developed regions of China where the motorway network is extensive, intercity coach is a common mean of transport between cities. In some cities, for example Shenzhen, nearly every town / district has a coach station.\n\nThere are numerous inter-city coach services between Hong Kong and various cities of Guangdong Province, e.g. Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai. These kinds of coaches are legally classified as a kind of non-franchised public bus, as \"International Passenger Service\".\n\nIn addition, there are some coach services which just carry passengers between the city of Hong Kong and the border crossing at Shenzhen, without entering the city centre in Shenzhen or further. These services are termed 'short-haul cross-boundary coach service' by the Transport Department which nearly the whole journey is within the limits of Hong Kong, as opposed to 'long-haul cross-boundary coach service' which runs between cities.\n\nIntercity coach service in Germany became important in the decades following the Second World War, as the Deutsche Bundesbahn and the German federal post office operated numerous bus routes in major cities and metropolitan areas associated with each other. While rail was quicker and more convenient, the buses were a low-cost alternative. With the increasing prosperity of society and the growing use of the automobile, the demand fell significantly and most of these lines were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nOne exception was traffic from and to (West-)Berlin. A long-distance bus network linking Berlin with Hamburg and several other German locations was created at the time of German division because of the small number of train services between the cities. It still exists today.\n\nUntil 2012 new long-distance bus lines could only be added in accordance with \"Passenger Transportation Act\" (PBefG), meaning if they did not compete with existing rail or bus lines. Since Germany - in contrast with many other European countries - has a well-developed rail network to all major cities and metropolitan areas, the domestic marketing of long-distance buses in Germany was much less significant than in many other countries.\n\nThe existing lines were often international lines as exist in almost all European countries, and for the transportation within Germany, there was a ban.\n\nIn 2012, the PBefG was amended, essentially allowing intercity bus services. Thus, since 1 January 2013 Coach services have been allowed if they are longer than 50 kilometers, which led to a fast-growing market with companies like Meinfernbus, Deinbus, Flixbus, ADAC Postbus, Berlin Linien Bus GmbH and City2City. Starting shortly after the establishment of the market a consolidation process occurred, which reduced the number of competing companies. ADAC Postbus became Postbus upon the ADAC leaving the cooperation. Meinfernbus and Flixbus fused to create a common company (currently the biggest operator of long-distance buses in Germany) while City2City folded operations. Deinbus came close to bankruptcy but secured an investor in time.\n\nSince Greece's rail network was underdeveloped, intercity bus travel became important in the post-war years.\nThe main bus operator in Greece is KTEL. It was founded in 1952.\n\nGenerally slower than rail travel with refreshment and toilet stops required on longer routes. \nThe main operators in the country are the Bus Éireann and private operators, such as JJ Kavanagh and Sons. The bus service between Dublin and Belfast is provided by Bus Éireann and Ulsterbus providing frequent service, including direct connections to Dublin Airport. Some bus services run overnight.\n\nBecause of the weak-developed rail network and the small size of the country and the resulting low domestic air traffic, the long-distance bus cooperative Egged is the main public transport service in the country. Because of the widespread network, Egged is considered one of the largest bus companies in the world, in part because of the long-distance bus lines. However, in recent years Israel railways has expanded and upgraded its route network and other companies have taken over routes previously served by Egged.\n\nIn the relatively small Netherlands there is a limited number of long-distance routes within the country. In 1994, the Interliner-network started with express buses on connections devoid of rail transport. Owing to high fares, a dense rail network and other reasons, the Interliner network fell apart into several different systems. In 2014, only a limited number of express buses existed as regular public transport usually under the name Qliner.\n\n\nBesides of regular public transport, a number of international bus companies serves Netherlands.\n\nNorway has long-distance bus routes within the country. They operate in barely inhabited areas, including mountains, and affect the construction of a comprehensive railway network. Except in the Oslo area, Norway has only a rather sparse rail network, which extends north of the Arctic Circle to Fauske and Bodø, and to the north of Narvik with a connection to the Swedish rail network. Many of the routes are based on random railways. In addition to this network, they provide public passenger transport by many more companies within Norway than airlines, shipping lines (including the Hurtigruten) and bus lines, including many long-distance bus lines.\n\nThe buses used in the north of the country (especially in the county of Finnmark) have both a passenger compartment and a freight compartment in the rear: many remote villages are connected to the outside world only by these buses, thus achieving a large part of the cargo by bus to the city.\n\nIntercity bus transportation has risen dramatically in Pakistan due to the decline of Pakistan Railways and the unaffordable prices of airplanes for the average Pakistani. Numerous companies have started operating within the country such as Daewoo Express and Niazi Express,Manthar Bus Service and have gained considerable popularity due to their reliability, security and good service. Smaller vans are used for transportation in the mountainous north where narrow and dangerous roads make it impossible for the movement of larger buses.\n\nIntercity bus travel in Serbia, as well as in other countries of former Yugoslavia, is very popular in proportion to travel by rail and air. In some regions, data has shown that intercity bus routes have transported over ten times the number of passengers carried by intercity trains on the same competing routes. It has been a trend around Serbia and the Balkan region that small towns and some villages have their own flagship bus carrier, often branded with the last name of the family whose owner runs that bus company. Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, and Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, have very large central bus terminals that operate 24 hours a day. The largest intercity bus operator in the whole region is Lasta Beograd which operates from Serbia to many countries in Europe.\n\nSwitzerland has an extremely dense network of interconnected rail, bus and ship lines, including some long-distance bus lines. Although Switzerland is a mountainous country, the rail network is denser than Germany's. Switzerland is an exception to the rule that long-distance bus lines are established especially in countries with inadequate railway network, or in areas with low population density. Some of the railway and main bus routes on Italian territory also serve to shorten the distance between Swiss towns. From Germany lines run from Frankfurt am Main, Heidelberg, Karlsruhe to Basel and Lucerne.\n\nLong-distance bus services in Switzerland:\n\nMost of the time, coaches in Taiwan is driving on Controlled-access highway, so it is mainly called Highway Coach(Chinese name:國道客運).\ne.g. KBus（國光客運）, UBus（統聯客運）, HoHsin（和欣客運）.\n\nTurkey has an extensive network of intercity buses. Every part of the country is served, including the most remote cities in the east. The buses are popular, comfortable and frequent. For example, there are over 150 departures from Istanbul to Ankara each day. The level of onboard service is very high, with free drinks and snacks on long-distance routes. The main operators are Pamukkale Turizm, Kâmil Koç, Metro Turizm, Varan, Ulusoy and. Tickets can be bought online from all of them.\n\nThere is an extensive network of scheduled coach transport in the United Kingdom. However, passenger numbers are a fraction of those travelling by rail. Coach travel companies often require passengers to purchase tickets in advance of travel, that is they may not be bought on board. The distinction between bus and coach services is not absolute, and some coach services, especially in Scotland, operate as local bus services over sections of route where there is no other bus service.\nNational Express Coaches has operated services under that name since 1972. Megabus started in 2004 and Greyhound UK in 2009. There are many other operators. Receipts in 2004 were £1.8 billion (2008 prices) and grew significantly between 1980 and 2010. Ulsterbus connect places in Northern Ireland which are no longer on the railway network.\n\nIn the mid-1950s more than 2,000 buses operated by Greyhound Lines, Trailways, and other companies connected 15,000 cities and towns. Passenger volume decreased as a result of expanding road and air travel, and urban decay that caused many neighborhoods with bus depots to become more dangerous. In 1960, American intercity buses carried 140 million riders; the rate decreased to 40 million by 1990, and continued to decrease until 2006.\n\nBy 1997, intercity bus transportation accounted for only 3.6% of travel in the United States. In the late 1990s, however, Chinatown bus lines that connected New York with Boston and Philadelphia's Chinatowns began operating. They became popular with non-Chinese college students and others who wanted inexpensive transportation, and between 1997 and 2007 Greyhound lost 60% of its market share in the northeast United States to the Chinatown buses. During the following decade, new bus lines such as Megabus and BoltBus emulated the Chinatown buses' practices of low prices and curbside stops on a much larger scale, both in the original Northeast Corridor and elsewhere, while introducing yield management techniques to the industry.\n\nBy 2010 curbside buses' annual passenger volume had risen by 33% and they accounted for more than 20% of all bus trips. One analyst estimated that curbside buses that year carried at least 2.4 billion passenger miles in the Northeast Corridor, compared to 1.7 billion passenger miles for Amtrak trains. Traditional depot-based bus lines also grew, benefiting from what the American Bus Association called \"the Megabus effect\", akin to the Southwest Effect, and both Greyhound and its subsidiary Yo! Bus, which competed directly with the Chinatown buses, benefited after the federal government shut several Chinatown lines down in June 2012.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2014, American intercity buses focused on medium-haul trips between 200 and 300 miles; airplanes performed the bulk of longer trips and automobiles shorter ones. For most medium-haul trips curbside bus fares were less than the cost of automobile gasoline, and one tenth that of Amtrak. Buses are also four times more fuel-efficient than automobiles. Their Wi-Fi service is also popular; one study estimated that 92% of Megabus and BoltBus passengers planned to use an electronic device. New lower fares introduced by Greyhound on traditional medium-distance routes and rising gasoline prices have increased ridership across the network and made bus travel cheaper than all alternatives.\n\nEffective June 25, 2014, Greyhound reintroduced many much longer bus routes, including New York–Los Angeles, Los Angeles–Vancouver, and others, while increasing frequencies on existing long-distance and ultra-long-distance buses routes. This turned back the tide of shortening bus routes and puts Greyhound back in the position of competing with long-distance road trips, airlines, and trains. Long-distance buses were to have Wi-Fi, power outlets, and extra legroom, sometimes extra recline, and were to be cleaned, refueled, and driver-changed at major stations along the way, coinciding with Greyhound's eradication of overbooking. It also represented Greyhound's traditional bus expansion over the expansion of curbside bus lines.\n\nOn August 4, 1952, Greyhound Lines had its deadliest accident when two Greyhound buses collided head-on along then-U.S. Route 81 near Waco, Texas. The fuel tanks of both buses then ruptured, bursting into flames. Of the 56 persons aboard both coaches, 28 were killed, including both drivers.\n\nOn May 9, 1980, a freight ship collided with the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, resulting in several vehicles, including a Greyhound bus, falling into the Tampa Bay. All 26 people on the bus perished, along with nine others. This is the largest loss of life on a single Greyhound coach to date.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, a bus operated by Tierra Santa Inc. crashed on Interstate 10 in Arizona, killing six and injuring sixteen passengers. The bus was not carrying insurance, and had also been operating illegally because the company had applied for authority to operate an interstate bus service, but had failed to respond to requests for additional information.\n\nThough generally rare, various incidents have occurred over time involving both drivers and passengers on intercity buses.\n\nSecurity became a concern following the September 11 attacks. Less than a month later, on October 3, 2001, Damir Igric, a passenger on a Greyhound bus, slit the throat of the driver, killing Igric, and six other passengers as the bus crashed. It was determined there was no connection between the September 11 attacks and this incident. Nevertheless, this raised concern.\n\nOn September 30, 2002, another Greyhound driver was assaulted near Fresno, California, resulting in two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, driver shields were installed on most Greyhound buses that now prevent passengers from directly having contact the driver while the bus is in motion, even if the shield is forced open. On buses which do not have the shield, the seats directly behind the driver are generally off limits.\n\nThe growing popularity in the United States of new bus lines such as Megabus and BoltBus that pick up and drop off passengers on the street instead of bus depots has led to a rise in the perceived security of intercity buses. Megabus states that a quarter of its passengers are unaccompanied women.\n\nUrban-suburban bus line is generally categorized as public transit, especially for large metropolitan transit networks. Usually these routes cover a long distance compared to most transit bus routes, but still short—usually 40 miles in one direction. An urban-suburban bus line generally connects a suburban area to the downtown core.\n\nThe vehicle can be something as simple as a merely refitted school bus (which sometimes already contains overhead storage racks) or a minibus. Often a suburban coach may be used, which is a standard transit bus modified to have some of the functionality of an interstate coach. An example would be the Suburban line employed by TransLink (Vancouver), typically going from the downtown core of Vancouver to suburban cities such as Delta and White Rock. In such case, the vehicles are modified standard transit bus, but with only one door and air conditioning. The vehicles provide accommodation for the disabled (through a lift or ramp at the front), and thus has a few high-back seats, usually in the front, that can be folded up for wheelchairs. The rest of the seats are reclining upholstered seats and have individual lights and overhead storage bins. Because it is a commuter bus, it has some (but not much) standing room, stop-request devices, and a farebox. This model also has a bike rack at the front to accommodate two bicycles.\n\nSome lines use a full-size interstate coach with on board toilet, such as the \"TrainBus\" service of Vancouver's West Coast Express commuter rail system. Suburban models in the United States are often used in Park-and-Ride services, and are very common in the New York City area, where New Jersey Transit Bus Operations is a major operator serving widespread bedroom communities.\n\n"}

Developed primarily by George Williams until 2012, FontForge is free software and is distributed under a mix of the GNU General Public License Version 3 and the 3-clause BSD license. It is available for operating systems including Linux, Windows and macOS and is localized into 12 languages.\n\nTo facilitate automated format conversion and other repetitive tasks, FontForge implements two scripting languages: its own language and Python. FontForge can run scripts from its GUI, from the command line, and also offers its features as a Python module so it can be integrated into any Python program.\n\nFontForge supports Adobe's OpenType feature file specification (with its own extensions to the syntax). It also supports the unofficial Microsoft mathematical typesetting extensions (codice_1 table) introduced for Cambria Math and supported by Office 2007, XeTeX and LuaTeX. At least one free OpenType mathematical font has been developed in FontForge.\n\nFontForge uses FreeType for rendering fonts on screen. Since the November 15, 2008 release, FontForge uses libcairo and libpango software libraries for graphics and text rendering providing anti-aliased graphics and complex text layout support.\n\nFontForge can use Potrace or AutoTrace to auto trace bitmap images and import them into a font.\n\nParts of FontForge code are used by the LuaTeX typesetting engine for reading and parsing OpenType fonts.\n\nThe FontForge source code includes a number of utility programs, including 'showttf' which shows the contents of binary font files, and a WOFF converter and deconverter.\n\nFontForge supports a wide variety of font formats. Its native \"Spline Font Database\" format (codice_2 file name extension) is text-based and facilitates collaboration between designers, as difference files can be easily created. FontForge also supports the interoperable UFO source format, which is based on XML.\n\nThe software supports many other font formats and converts fonts from one format to another. Supported font formats include: TrueType (TTF), TrueType Collection (TTC), OpenType (OTF), PostScript Type 1, TeX Bitmap Fonts, X11 OTB bitmap (only sfnt), Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF), FON (Windows), FNT (Windows), and Web Open Font Format (WOFF). FontForge also imports and exports fonts to and from the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format and the Unified Font Object (UFO) format.\n\nThe FontForge project was founded by George Williams as a retirement project, and initially published from 2001 to March 2004 as \"PfaEdit\").\n\nWilliams actively developed, maintained and supported the program and related utilities for around 12 years. In mid-2011, Dave Crossland began contributing to the project and the project moved from SourceForge to GitHub. Crossland began offering introductory type design workshops through the TeX Users Group (TUG) to raise funds to hire contract developers to maintain and develop the program. FontForge's development became more active, and Khaled Hosny and Barry Schwartz were notable contributors, but in late 2012 they and Crossland disagreed about the direction of the project so they forked FontForge as SortsMill Tools.\n\nIn 2011, FontForge was packaged for easier installation on Mac OS X by Dr. Ben Martin with support from TUG. Meanwhile, Matthew Petroff published his Windows Build System and unofficial Windows builds. In 2013 the FontForgeBuilds project was started on sourceforge to extend this; it was subsequently entirely rewritten, and is today maintained by Jeremy Tan as an official Windows package.\n\nIn 2012, Crossland organized a new project website to be hosted on GitHub Pages, , and used funds raised from teaching FontForge to beginners to hire a contract web designer. With his support Martin added a real time collaboration feature that was presented by them both as a keynote at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2013 in Madrid.\n\nIn 2014, with financial support from Google, Frank Trampe added full support for the UFO font source format.\n\n\n\n"}

Variant spellings include Khechari Mudra, Kecharimudra, and Kechari Mudra. \"Mudrā\" (Sanskrit, मुद्रा, literally \"seal\"), when used in yoga, is a position that is designed to awaken spiritual energies in the body.\n\nThe Buddhist Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind (example), depending on the passage. However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx. Khechari Mudra is to be practised when the practitioner is on a light, healthy diet, otherwise constipation tends to occur, as the prana or life energy needed to digest food does not adequately reach the lower chakras.\n\nA hathayoga text, the \"Khecarīvidyā\", states that \"khechari mudra\" enables one to raise Kundalini and access various stores of amrita in the head, which subsequently flood the body. Siva, in the same text, gives instructions on how to cut the lingual frenulum as a necessary prerequisite for the kechari mudra practice: \n\nA tantric Saiva text, the \"Mālinīvijayottaratantra\", warns:\n\nBhattacharyya defines as the \"Yogic posture which bestows spiritual attainment and enables one to overcome disease and death.\" He explains that \"\"Kha\" denotes \"brahman\", and that power which moves (\"cara\") as the kinetic energy of \"brahman\" is known (as) Khecarī.\" Singh defines as \"the bliss of the vast expanse of spiritual consciousness, also known as divya mudrā or Śivāvasthā (the state of Śivā).\" He further identifies it in a higher sense—with the end state of consciousness, and not just the physical posture used to achieve that end: \"So Khecarī Mudrā in Śaiva āgama means a state of universal consciousness which is the state of Śiva.\" Abhinavagupta, in his \"Tantraloka\", states that all other mudras derive from \"khecarī mudrā\", which he describes as \"the stance of moving or flying through the void of the supreme consciousness.\" The practice is also mentioned in the \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\" (III. 6-7).\n\nIn recent times, \"khecarī mudrā\" was taught by Paramahansa Yogananda as a part of Kriya Yoga practice. Yogananda stated that:\n\nAccording to Swami Kriyananda, \"The assumption of this mudra helps to hasten the advent of deep spiritual states of consciousness.\" Swami Sivananda described as \"the best of all Mudras.\"\n\n"}

It is part of the University of Houston System. Its campus spans in Victoria with a satellite location at UHV Katy. Founded in 1971, UHV has an enrollment of over 4,300 students.\n\nThe school's athletics teams are known as the UHV Jaguars; the university has fielded baseball and softball teams, and men’s and women’s soccer and golf teams. The UHV Jaguars are members of the Red River Athletic Conference and compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division I.\n\nThe University of Houston–Victoria began as an effort in the late 1960s by the local community to bring a higher learning institution to Victoria. In 1971, the Coordinating Board of Texas College and University System created an off-campus center of the University of Houston known as the University of Houston Victoria Center. One hundred students enrolled at the center in its inaugural semester of spring 1973.\n\nIn April 1983, the Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 235, which granted the institution permanent degree-granting status in the state of Texas. The University of Houston Victoria Center was renamed the University of , and became the University of Houston System's fourth university.\n\nUHV started its athletics program during the 2007–2008 school year with the Jaguars baseball and softball team. Since then, the teams have competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Soccer and golf programs for both men and women began in fall 2010.\n\nIn October 2008, the UH System Board of Regents adopted a resolution authorizing UHV to seek enabling state legislation to add freshmen and sophomores. In the 81st Texas legislative session, Texas State Representative Geanie Morrison of Victoria introduced House Bill 1056, which would allow UHV to expand, and Texas State Senator Glenn Hegar introduced an identical bill, Senate Bill 567. Texas Governor Rick Perry signed HB 1056 into law on June 19, 2009. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools approved UHV to admit underclassmen and offer lower-division courses on November 17, 2009, and UHV also received its first freshman application the same day. UHV’s first freshmen and sophomores started taking classes in fall 2010, and the university’s first residence hall, Jaguar Hall, opened on the Victoria campus.\nThe University of Houston–Victoria (UHV) is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the University of Houston System. The institution is separately accredited, offers its own academic programs and confers its own degrees, and has its own administration. UHV is a stand-alone university; it is not a branch campus of the University of Houston (UH).

Students who graduate from UHV will have diplomas under the name University of .\n\nWhile previously an upper-division and graduate school only, UHV expanded in fall 2010 to admit freshmen and sophomores. UHV consists of four academic colleges: the School of Arts & Sciences, the School of Business Administration, the School of Education & Human Development, and the School of Nursing. Each school offers both undergraduate degrees and master’s degrees.\n\nThe School of Arts & Sciences offers flexible course scheduling through online classes and off-site courses, in addition to the traditional on-campus classes. The School of Arts & Sciences offers a range of programs in the divisions of Humanities; Science, Technology and Mathematics; and Social & Behavioral Sciences. It is home to the literary institutions \"American Book Review\", Fiction Collective Two, \"symplokē\" and Cuneiform Press. It also houses the Society for Critical Exchange, and Centro Victoria.\n\nThe University of Houston–Victoria's School of Business offers degree programs face-to-face or 100% online.\n\nThe School of Education, Health Professions, and Human Development offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The undergraduate degree is for those seeking elementary, middle and secondary teaching careers or a career in health studies as a public health educator.\n\nCurrently, the university has an 18-to-1 ratio and an average class size of 20 students. Instructors come from Canada, China, Colombia, Cuba, Belarus, India, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nHonor societies with UHV chapters include Phi Kappa Phi, Gamma Beta Phi, Chi Sigma Iota, Psi Chi and Kappa Delta Pi.\n\nUHV was the first Texas public university to offer an accelerated program where students can earn a complete, 120-credit-hour bachelor's degree in just three years. Degree in Three, or Dn3, lets students earn a degree in Communication, Criminal Justice, English, History or Psychology.\n\nThe campus of UHV is located in Victoria, which is part of the Texas Coastal Bend region. It is approximately 30 miles (48 km) from the Gulf of Mexico. The university is nearly equidistant by about 125 miles (201 km) from the cities of Houston, San Antonio and Austin. The Victoria campus consists of about 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land.\n\nThe Victoria campus shares some of its facilities with Victoria College. This includes a bookstore/student center, a four-story library with more than 185,000 items in their collection and a fitness center that includes a gym and weight room.\n\nJaguar Village consists of three residence halls: Jaguar Hall, Jaguar Suites and Jaguar Court.\n\nJaguar Hall also has an on-site dining room and is located a short, 10-minute walk to the UHV campus.\n\nThe university opened its second residential hall, Jaguar Court and Jaguar Suites opened in fall 2013 and is the UHV's third residential hall.\n\nDon and Mona Smith Hall is the newest student housing project and will be adjacent to the Student Commons.

To date, he has directed ten feature films, all of which border somewhere between realistic drama and the avant-garde. His films have won several awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Two of Dumont's films have won the Grand Prix award: both \"L'Humanité\" (1999) and \"Flandres\" (2006). Dumont's \"Hadewijch\" won the 2009 Prize of the International Critics (FIPRESCI Prize) for Special Presentation at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nDumont has a background of Greek and German (Western) philosophy, and of corporate video. His films often show the ugliness of extreme violence and provocative sexual behavior, and are usually classified as art films. Dumont has himself likened his films to visual arts, and he typically uses long takes, close-ups of people's bodies, and story lines involving extreme emotions. Dumont does not write traditional scripts for his films. Instead, he writes complete novels which are then the basis for his filmmaking.\n\nHe says that some of his favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Roberto Rossellini, and Abbas Kiarostami. He is frequently considered an artistic heir to Robert Bresson.\n\nHis—extremely divisive—work has been connected to a recent French cinéma du corps/body of cinema, encompassing contemporary films by Claire Denis, Marina de Van, Gaspar Noé, Diane Bertrand, and François Ozon, among others. According to Tim Palmer, this trajectory includes a focus on states of corporeality in and of themselves, independent of narrative exposition or character psychology. In a more pejorative vein, James Quandt has also talked of some of this group of filmmakers, as the so-called New French Extremity.\n\nHis 2011 film \"Hors Satan\" premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

It is a cover of the German song \"Und jetzt ist es still\", performed by Horst Winter in 1948, with music written by Austrian composer Hans Lang and German lyrics by Erich Meder. The English lyrics were written by Bert Reisfeld. A French title, \"Tout est tranquille\", was performed in 1949 by Ginette Garcin and the Jacques Hélian Orchestra.\n\nThe song was covered by Icelandic musician Björk in 1995. It was released as the third single from her second album \"Post\" and remains her biggest hit, reaching number 4 in the UK and spending 15 weeks on the UK Singles Chart. Fuelled by the Spike Jonze-directed music video clip (see below), the single also shot Björk into the spotlight in Australia, where it reached number 6. In the United Kingdom the single has been certified as Gold, having sold upwards of 400,000 copies. Despite being her biggest hit among the general public, the song did not appear on Björk's 2002 compilation \"Greatest Hits\", which includes singles chosen by fans via online survey. In an interview on \"BBC Radio 1\" with Chris Evans in 1995, Björk said the song had been played on the bus she had used on a recent tour and she recorded it as a thank you to the team that worked with her on that tour.\n\nIn 2002, Brittany Murphy made a performance of this song, joined by The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nIn 2005, Lucy Woodward covered the song for the soundtrack for the film \"Ice Princess\".

Based on Jacques Demy's 1964 film \"Les Parapluies de Cherbourg\", it features everything in slow motion and set in a Broadway musical style as Björk sings the verses; during the riotous chorus, everything returns to regular speed and everyone near her dances along. Normal life resumes during the next verse with the return of slow motion. This theme continues throughout the video.\n\nThe video begins as Björk emerges from an extremely dirty washroom in an auto shop. She dances along with the auto workers for the first chorus, then emerges from the shop. During the second chorus, she dances tap with a few people outside of the auto shop. Björk continues to walk along the street, dancing with several elderly women and their umbrellas before settling to rest her arms on top of a mailbox for the final verse. The mailbox comes alive and dances along with Björk during this chorus. Björk then runs down the street and into the road, where the rest of the town has decided to join her for one large dance number. The video ends with Björk floating up above the townsfolk and hushing the viewer.\n\n\"It's Oh So Quiet\" video received six nominations for the MTV Video Music Awards for 1996 including Best Female Video, Best Art Direction, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction in a Video, International Viewer's Choice Award — MTV Europe, and Best Choreography in a Video, winning in the latter category.

Phytoplankton rely on a suite of nutrients for cellular function. Macronutrients (e.g., nitrate, phosphate, silicic acid) are generally available in higher quantities in surface ocean waters, and are the typical components of common garden fertilizers. Micronutrients (e.g., iron, zinc, cobalt) are generally available in lower quantities and include trace metals. Macronutrients are typically available in millimolar concentrations, while micronutrients are generally available in micro- to nanomolar concentrations. In general, nitrogen tends to be a limiting ocean nutrient, but in HNLC regions it is never significantly depleted. Instead, these regions tend to be limited by low concentrations of metabolizable iron. Iron is a critical phytoplankton micronutrient necessary for enzyme catalysis and electron transport.\n\nBetween the 1930s and '80s, it was hypothesized that iron is a limiting ocean micronutrient, but there were not sufficient methods to reliably detect iron in seawater to confirm this hypothesis. In 1989, high concentrations of iron-rich sediments in nearshore coastal waters off the Gulf of Alaska were detected. However, offshore waters had lower iron concentrations and lower productivity despite macronutrient availability for phytoplankton growth. This pattern was observed in other oceanic regions and led to the naming of three major HNLC zones: the North Pacific Ocean, the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the Southern Ocean.\n\nThe discovery of HNLC regions has fostered scientific debate about the ethics and efficacy of iron fertilization experiments which attempt to draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide by stimulating surface-level photosynthesis. It has also led to the development of hypotheses such as grazing control which poses that HNLC regions are formed, in part, from the grazing of phytoplankton (e.g. dinoflagellates, ciliates) by smaller organisms (e.g. protists).\n\nPrimary production is the process by which autotrophs use light to convert carbon from aqueous carbon dioxide to sugar for cellular growth. Light catalyzes the photosynthetic process and nutrients are incorporated into organic material. For photosynthesis to occur, macronutrients such as nitrate and phosphate must be available in sufficient ratios and bioavailable forms for biological utilization. The molecular ratio of 106(Carbon):16(Nitrogen):1(Phosphorus) was discovered by Redfield, Ketcham, and Richards (RKR) and is known as the Redfield Ratio. Photosynthesis (forward) and respiration (reverse) is represented by the equation:\n\nPhotosynthesis can be limited by deficiencies of certain macronutrients. However, in the North Pacific, the Equatorial Pacific, and the Southern Ocean macronutrients are found in sufficient ratios, quantities and bioavailable forms to support greater levels of primary production than found. Macronutrient availability in HNLC regions in tandem with low standing stocks of phytoplankton suggests that some other biogeochemical process limits phytoplankton growth.\n\nSince primary production and phytoplankton biomass cannot currently be measured over entire ocean basins, scientists use chlorophyll α as a proxy for primary production. Modern satellite observations monitor and track global chlorophyll α abundances in the ocean via remote sensing. Higher chlorophyll concentrations generally indicate areas of enhanced primary production, and conversely lower chlorophyll levels indicate low primary production. This co-occurrence of low chlorophyll and high macronutrient availability is why these regions are deemed \"high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll.\"\n\nIn addition to the macronutrients needed for organic matter synthesis, phytoplankton need micronutrients such as trace metals for cellular functions. Micronutrient availability can constrain primary production because trace metals are sometimes limiting nutrients. Iron has been determined to be a primary limiting micronutrient in HNLC provinces. Recent studies have indicated that zinc and cobalt may be secondary and/or co-limiting micronutrients.\n\nHNLC regions cover 20% of the world’s oceans and are characterized by varying physical, chemical, and biological patterns. These surface waters have annually varying, yet relatively abundant macronutrient concentrations compared to other oceanic provinces. While HNLC broadly describes the biogeochemical trends of these large ocean regions, all three zones experience seasonal phytoplankton blooms in response to global atmospheric patterns. On average, HNLC regions tend to be growth-limited by iron and variably, zinc. This trace metal limitation leads to communities of smaller sized phytoplankton. Compared to more productive regions of the ocean, HNLC zones have higher ratios of silicic acid to nitrate because larger diatoms, that require silicic acid to make their opal silica shells, are less prevalent. Unlike the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific, the Equatorial Pacific experiences temporal silicate availability which leads to large seasonal diatom blooms.\n\nThe distribution of trace metals and relative abundance of macronutrients are reflected in the plankton community structure. For example, the selection of phytoplankton with a high surface area to volume ratio results in HNLC regions being dominated by nano- and picoplankton. This ratio allows for optimal utilization of available dissolved nutrients. Larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms, cannot energetically sustain themselves in these regions. Common picoplankton within these regions include genera such as prochlorococcus (not generally found in the North Pacific), synechococcus, and various eukaryotes. Grazing protists likely control the abundance and distribution of these small phytoplankton.\n\nThe generally lower net primary production in HNLC zones results in lower biological draw-down of atmospheric carbon dioxide and thus these regions are generally considered a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. HNLC areas are of interest to geoengineers and some in the scientific community who believe fertilizing large patches of these waters with iron could potentially lower dissolved carbon dioxide and offset increased anthropogenic carbon emissions. Analysis of Antarctic ice core data over the last million years shows correlation between high levels of dust and low temperature, indicating that addition of diffuse iron-rich dust to the sea has been a natural amplifier of climate cooling.\n\nThe discovery and naming of the first HNLC region, the North Pacific, was formalized in a seminal paper published in 1988. The study concluded that surface waters of the eastern North Pacific are generally dominated by picoplankton despite the relative abundance of macronutrients. In other words, larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms which thrive in nutrient-rich waters, were not found. Instead, the surface waters were replete with smaller pico- and nanoplankton. Based on laboratory nutrient experiments, iron was hypothesized to be a key limiting micronutrient.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is the largest and oldest body of water on Earth. The North Pacific is characterized by the general clockwise rotation of the North Pacific gyre, which is driven by trade winds. Spatial variations in tradewinds result in cooler air temperatures in the western North Pacific and milder air temperatures in the eastern North Pacific (i.e., Subartic Pacific). Iron is supplied to the North Pacific by dust storms that occur in Asia and Alaska as well as iron-rich waters advected from the continental margin, sometimes by eddies such as Haida Eddies.\n\nConcentrations of iron however vary throughout the year. Ocean currents are driven by seasonal atmospheric patterns which transport iron from the Kuril-Kamchatka margin into the western Subarctic Pacific. This introduction of iron provides a subsurface supply of micronutrients, which can be used by primary producers during upwelling of deeper waters to the surface. Seafloor depth may also stimulate phytoplankton blooms in HNLC regions as iron diffuses from the seafloor and alleviates iron limitation in shallow waters. Research conducted in the Gulf of Alaska showed that areas with shallow waters, such as the south shelf of Alaska, have more intense phytoplankton blooms than offshore waters. Volcanic ash from the eruption of the Kasatochi volcano in August 2008 provided an example of natural iron fertilization in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The region was fertilized by raining volcanic dust containing soluble iron. In the days following, phytoplankton blooms were visible from space.\n\nLimitations in trace metal concentrations in the North Pacific limit diatom blooms throughout the entire year. Even though the North Pacific is an HNLC region, it produces and exports to the ocean interior a relatively high amount of particulate biogenic silica compared to the North Atlantic, which supports significant diatom growth.\n\nThe Equatorial Pacific is an oceanic province characterized by nearly year-round upwelling due to the convergence of trade winds from the northeast and southeast at the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The Equatorial Pacific spans nearly half of Earth’s circumference and plays a major role in global marine new primary production. New production is a term used in biological oceanography to describe the way in which nitrogen is recycled within the ocean. In regions of enhanced new production, nitrate from the aphotic zone makes its way into surface waters, replenishing surface nitrate supply. Despite nitrogen availability in Equatorial Pacific waters, primary production and observed surface ocean biomass are considerably lower compared to other major upwelling regions of the ocean. Thus the Equatorial Pacific is considered one of the three major HNLC regions.\n\nLike other major HNLC provinces, the Equatorial Pacific is considered nutrient-limited due to lack of trace metals such as iron. The Equatorial Pacific receives approximately 7-10 times more iron from Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) upwelling than from inputs due to settling atmospheric dust. Climate reconstructions of glacial periods using sediment proxy records have revealed that the Equatorial Pacific may have been 2.5 times more productive than the modern equatorial ocean. During these glacial periods, the Equatorial Pacific increased its export of marine new production, thus providing a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The science of paleoceanography attempts to understand the interplay of glacial cycles with ocean dynamics. Paleo-oceanographers currently challenge the Aeolian Dust hypothesis which suggests that the atmospheric transport of iron-rich dust off Central and South America controls the intensity of primary production in the Equatorial Pacific. One study suggests that because EUC upwelling provides most of the bioavailable iron to the equatorial surface waters, the only method to reverse HNLC conditions is by enhancing upwelling. In other words, enhanced regional upwelling, rather than iron-rich atmospheric dust deposition, may explain why this region experiences higher primary productivity during glacial periods.\n\nCompared to the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, Equatorial Pacific waters have relatively low levels of biogenic silica and thus do not support significant standing stocks of diatoms. Picoplankton are the most abundant marine primary producers in these regions due mainly to their ability to assimilate low concentrations of trace metals. Various phytoplankton communities within the Equatorial Pacific are grazed at the same rate as their growth rate, which further limits primary production.\n\nThere is no current consensus regarding which of the two main hypotheses (grazing or micronutrients) controls production in these equatorial waters. It is likely that trace metal limitations select for smaller-celled organisms, which thereby increases the grazing pressure of protists. While the Equatorial Pacific maintains HNLC characteristics, productivity can be high at times. Productivity leads to an abundance of seabirds such as storm petrels near the convergence of subtropical water and the equatorial \"cold tongue.\" The Equatorial Pacific contains the world's largest yellowfin tuna fisheries and is home to the spotted dolphin.\n\nThe Southern Ocean is the largest HNLC region in the global ocean. The surface waters of the Southern Ocean have been widely identified as being rich in macronutrients despite low phytoplankton stocks. Iron deposited in the North Atlantic is incorporated into North Atlantic Deep Water and is transported to the Southern Ocean via thermohaline circulation. Eventually mixing with the Antarctic Circumpolar Water, upwelling provides iron and macronutrients to the Southern Ocean surface waters. Therefore, iron inputs and primary production in the Southern Ocean are sensitive to iron-rich Saharan dust deposited over the Atlantic. Because of low atmospheric dust inputs directly onto Southern Ocean surface waters, chlorophyll α concentrations are low. Light availability in the Southern Ocean changes dramatically seasonally, but it does not seem to be a significant constraint on phytoplankton growth.\n\nMacronutrients present in Southern Ocean surface waters come from upwelled deep water. While micronutrients such as zinc and cobalt may possibly co-limit phytoplankton growth in the Southern Ocean, iron appears to be a critical limiting micronutrient. Some regions of the Southern Ocean experience both adequate bioavailable iron and macronutrient concentrations yet phytoplankton growth is limited. Hydrographic studies and explorations of the Southern Drake Passage region have observed this phenomenon around the Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These areas are adjacent to shelf regions of Antarctica and islands of the Southern Ocean. The micronutrients required for algal growth are believed to be supplied from the shelves themselves. Except in areas close to the Antarctic shelf, micronutrient deficiency severely limits productivity in the Southern Ocean.\n\nIron availability is not the only regulator of phytoplankton productivity and biomass. In the Southern Ocean, prevailing low temperatures are believed to have a negative impact on phytoplankton growth rates. Phytoplankton growth rate is very intense and short lived in open areas surrounded by sea ice and permanent sea-ice zones. Grazing by herbivores such as krill, copepods and salps is believed to suppress phytoplankton standing stock. Unlike the open waters of the Southern Ocean, grazing along continental shelf margins is low, so most phytoplankton that are not consumed sink to the sea floor which provides nutrients to benthic organisms.\n\nGiven the remote location of HNLC areas, scientists have combined modeling and observational data in order to study limits on primary production. Combining these two data sources allows for comparison between the North Pacific, Equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean. Two current explanations for global HNLC regions are growth limitations due to iron availability and phytoplankton grazing controls.\n\nIn 1988, John Martin confirmed the hypothesis that iron limits phytoplankton blooms and growth rates in the North Pacific. His work was extrapolated to other HNLC regions through evidence which linked low surface iron concentration with low chlorophyll. In response to iron fertilization experiments (IronEx, SOIREE, SEEDS, etc.) in HNLC areas, large phytoplankton responses such as decreased surface nutrient concentration and increased biological activity were observed.\n\nIron fertilization studies conducted at repeated intervals over the span of a week have produced a larger biological response than a single fertilization event. The biological response size tends to depend on a site’s biological, chemical, and physical characteristics. In the Equatorial and North Pacific, silica is thought to constrain additional production after iron fertilization, while light limits additional production in the Southern Ocean. Native, smaller phytoplankton were initial responders to increased iron, but were quickly outcompeted by larger, coastal phytoplankton such as diatoms. The large bloom response and community shift has led to environmental concerns about fertilizing large sections of HNLC regions. One study suggests that diatoms grow preferentially during fertilization experiments. Some diatoms, such as pseudo-nitzschia, release the neurotoxin domoic acid, poisoning grazing fish. If diatoms grow preferentially during iron fertilization experiments, sustained fertilizations could enhance domoic acid poisoning in the marine food web near fertilized patches.\n\nIron enters remote HNLC regions through two primary methods: upwelling of nutrient-rich water and atmospheric dust deposition. Iron needs to be replenished frequently and in bioavailable forms because of its insolubility, rapid uptake through biological systems, and binding affinity with ligands. Dust deposition might not result in phytoplankton blooms unless settling dust is in the correct bioavailable form of iron. Additionally, iron must be deposited during productive seasons and coincide with the appropriate RKR-ratios of surface nutrients. Aeolian dust has a larger influence on Northern Hemisphere HNLC regions because more land mass contributes to more dust deposition. Due to the Southern Ocean's isolation from land, upwelling related to eddy diffusivity provides iron to HNLC regions.\n\nFormulated by John Walsh in 1976, the grazing hypothesis states that grazing by heterotrophs suppresses primary productivity in areas of high nutrient concentrations. Predation by microzooplankton primarily accounts for phytoplankton loss in HNLC regions. Grazing by larger zooplankton and advective mixing are also responsible for a small proportion of losses to phytoplankton communities. Constant grazing limits phytoplankton to a low, constant standing stock. Without this grazing pressure, some scientists believe small phytoplankton would produce blooms despite micronutrient depletion because smaller phytoplankton typically have lower iron requirements and can absorb nutrients at a slower rate.\n\nCurrent scientific consensus agrees that HNLC areas lack high productivity because of a combination of iron and physiological limitations, grazing pressure, and physical forcings. The extent to which each factor contributes to low production may differ in each HNLC region. Iron limitation allows for smaller, more iron-frugal phytoplankton to grow at rapid rates, while grazing by microzooplankton maintains stable stocks of these smaller phytoplankton. Once micronutrients become available, grazing may then limit bloom sizes. Additional micronutrient limitations from trace metals like zinc or cobalt may suppress phytoplankton blooms. Turbulent mixing at higher-latitude HNLC regions (North Pacific and Southern Ocean) may mix phytoplankton below the critical depth needed to have community growth.\n\nSince past iron fertilization experiments have resulted in large phytoplankton blooms, some have suggested that large-scale ocean fertilization experiments should be conducted to draw down inorganic anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the form of particulate organic carbon. Fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, leading to a decrease in the amount of inorganic surface carbon dioxide within a fertilized patch. The bloom would then die off and presumably sink to the deep ocean, taking much of the absorbed carbon dioxide to the seafloor and sequestering it from the short-term carbon cycle in the deep ocean or ocean sediments.\n\nTo effectively remove anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere, iron fertilization would need to result in significant removal of particulate carbon from the surface ocean and transport it to the deep ocean. Various studies estimated that less than 7-10% of carbon taken up during a bloom would be sequestered, and only a 15-25 ppm decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide would result with sustained global iron fertilization. The amount of carbon dioxide removed may be offset by the fuel cost of acquiring, transporting, and releasing significant amounts of iron into remote HNLC regions.\n\nMany environmental concerns exist for large-scale iron fertilization. While blooms can be studied and traced, scientists still do not know if the extra production gets incorporated into the food chain or falls to the deep ocean after a bloom dies off. Even if carbon is exported to depth, raining organic matter can be respired, potentially creating mid-column anoxic zones or causing acidification of deep ocean water. Pronounced community shifts to diatoms have been observed during fertilization, and it’s still unclear if the change in species composition has any long-term environmental effects.\n\nThe following is completely theoretical. Testing would be required to determine feasibility, optimum iron concentration per unit area, carbon sequestration by area over time, need for other micro-nutrients, amount of energy required to maintain such a system, and the potential amount of energy produced by the system. This system considers economic feasibility (profitability of bio-fuel products and carbon credits) and risk management.\n\nGrazing results in algae being consumed by micro-zooplankton. This predation results in less than 7-10% of carbon being taken to the bottom of the ocean. Growing algae in floating farms could allow these HNLC areas to grow algae for harvest without the problem of predation. Algae grown in floating farms would be recycled through grazing if there was a catastrophic failure of a floating farm, which would limit any environmental damage.\n\nAlgae grown in floating farms could be harvested and used for food or fuel. All biological life is made up of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleic acids. Whole algae could be turned into animal feed, fertilizer, or bio-char. Separating the lipids from the algae could also create bio-diesel from the lipid content and bio-char from the rest. Of course, the algae could be pumped to the bottom of the ocean, below any grazing pressure for sequestration.\n\nIn a controlled floating farm, the harvest could be sampled to record the amount of algae per unit volume which will indicate the amount of carbon being sequestered. If this carbon is sequestered at the bottom of the ocean, this figure could be used to accurately create carbon credits. Sequestering carbon dioxide on the ocean floor could destroy the unstudied ecosystem and cause undiscovered lifeforms to go extinct.\n\nCarbon sequestration on land does so with desiccated algae. Without sufficient sources of water, bacteria and other life will have a difficult time digesting the sequestered algae. Biofuels, not sold and used as renewable fuel, could be sequestered in abandoned oil wells and coal mines. The volume of bio-diesel and mass of bio-char would provide an accurate figure for producing (when sequestering) and selling (when removing from wells or mines) carbon credits.\n\n"}

It is the only film directed by Sandrich.\n\nAfter Nick Gardenia (Chase) is forced to rob a bank, and becomes a fugitive, he seeks help from his ex-wife Glenda Parks (Hawn), a public defender. Her current husband, Ira Parks (Grodin), is the Los Angeles County district attorney, who harbors a jealous disdain towards Nick.\n\nThe film was the second pairing of Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase, after 1978's \"Foul Play\".\n\nNick Gardenia (Chevy Chase), an out-of-luck writer, has the use of a friend's oceanside cabin in Big Sur, California. He is interrupted by a pair of bank robbers who use him to rob a bank in Carmel. Their M.O. is to take an innocent person, force them at gunpoint to rob a bank, and then take the money and toss their captive out of their car. Unfortunately for Nick (in one of Chase's signature pratfalls), he trips in the bank, is helped up and looks directly into a security camera.\n\nThe bank's picture of Nick comes to the attention of Los Angeles district attorney Ira Parks (Charles Grodin) when his assistant, Fred (Robert Guillaume), recognizes it to be Parks' wife's ex-husband. Because of his desire to become the state's attorney general, Ira is frustrated and upset, thinking this could harm his campaign.\n\nIra's wife, Glenda (Goldie Hawn), is a lawyer herself. A public defender, Glenda often tries to rehabilitate her clients by giving them odd jobs around their house, as with her chauffeur/butler Chester (T. K. Carter). After a long day in court, Glenda comes home to mixed news—joy for Ira's run for Attorney General and surprise when Ira gives her the news about Nick. She wants to defend Nick because of her disbelief that he would ever do such a thing.\n\nThe robbers ditch Nick and he desperately begins to make his way to Glenda and Ira's Brentwood home, inadvertently holding up a gas station attendant for candy bars along the way. During a party, Glenda, while searching for one of her dogs, finds Nick hiding in her garage. He begs for help and she tries to get him some food, despite most of the leaders of law enforcement being in her house. Nick explains what happened, but Glenda refuses to help unless he turns himself in. Glenda finally agrees to let him sleep in a guest room over the garage.\n\nThe next day Nick decides he wants to go after the guys who did this to him. After some comically close run-ins with the police, Ira, and her feisty maid, Aurora De La Hoya (Yvonne Wilder), Glenda manages to keep anyone from knowing Nick was there. He later robs Glenda of her car but then reappears over her garage, and another confrontation ensues between Ira and Glenda.\n\nIra soon discovers Nick was telling the truth about the two men who forced him to rob the bank. About to have the governor of California coming to the house for dinner, Glenda must deal with court cases, her maid having foot surgery (which could ruin the party without the governor's favorite dish), and Chester getting drunk in the kitchen. The party takes a hilarious turn when Nick, coming back to turn himself in, ends up serving dinner to the governor, Ira, Glenda, and Fred. The dinner ultimately ends in a fistfight between a jealous Ira and Nick, during which Fred is knocked out.\n\nNick, Glenda, Ira, Aurora, the dogs and the robbers ultimately end up in the courtroom of Glenda's favorite Judge John Channing (Harold Gould). While the judge is overwhelmed by the happenings in the Parks household, the police bring in the bank robbers. They admit Nick's innocence in exchange for a reduced sentence after getting caught by Aurora and the dogs when they attempted to force her to rob a bank, just like they had done with Nick.\n\nAfter all is said and done, Nick is free, but he and Glenda still have unresolved feelings. She decides to stay with Ira and kisses Nick good-bye. Some time later, Ira and Glenda decide to take a car trip to forget the recent events. They end up in an accident trying to avoid a cow on the road. Ira breaks his leg, so Glenda has to go for help. She ends up at the only place around: a cabin with all the lights on. Glenda pounds on the door begging for help. The door opens and she discovers the cabin is Nick's.\n\n\nRoger Ebert, in a December 24, 1980 review, gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that although it made him \"laugh out loud\", the movie never \"edged over the line of success\". He said, \"the good parts were good enough to hold out the promise for more. The movie is Neil Simon's attempt at one of those 1940s-style screwball comedies with lots of surprise entrances and hasty exits and people hiding under the bed. It would be hard to improve on the casting (Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase and Charles Grodin). And there are a couple of really funny, sustained sequences.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" also awarded two stars out of four and called it a \"limp comedy\" with \"only gag lines and no characters.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"Neil Simon in very funny form\" and the cast as \"extremely appealing,\" adding, \"The material here is slick and entertaining, and Mr. Sandrich settles for comic simplicity without reaching for anything more. He coaxes the film along at a cheerfully breakneck rhythm.\"\n\nCharles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"if it gets a zero for innovation, it gets somewhere around 93 for the skill with which it delivers an old-fashioned slapstick farce. Like a Henny Youngman routine, it is funny partly because it tries so hard, in a stop-at-nothing-you-take-my-wife-please way, to be funny.\" \"Variety\" wrote that Sandrich \"has relied basically upon Neil Simon's script, often funny but thin on development, to carry things. The result is a picture that is amusing on the surface but very typical in terms of its setups ... Of course, none of the pic's drawbacks much matter thanks to the extremely engaging rapport between Chase and Hawn.\" Jack Kroll of \"Newsweek\" wrote that Simon's working on the models of old screwball comedies gave the movie \"a breeziness most of his film writing has lacked. On the laugh meter this movie does well. Sandrich has a nice light touch, and his cast is excellent. Especially, of course, Goldie Hawn, the delightful comedienne who provides more pure pleasure than any other movie actress today.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor for Charles Grodin.\n\nAccording to Turner Classic Movies, Neil Simon was inspired by \"The Talk of the Town\". This 1942 comedy starred Cary Grant as a wrongfully accused man hiding out at the home of a beautiful woman, played by Jean Arthur, with Ronald Colman as the third member of the romantic triangle.\n\n"}

The song was written by Björk and co-produced by long time collaborator Nellee Hooper. The recording sessions of \"Post\" and hence \"Hyperballad\" took place in Compass Point Studios, The Bahamas, allegedly to save tax money. \"Hyperballad\" infuses folktronica and acid house. \n\nThe lyrical content discusses a dream that Björk experienced, in which she wakes early before her lover and throws small objects off a cliff, watching them smash. She imagines her body in their place, which makes her feel better about returning to her safe home and the arms of her lover.\n\n\"Hyperballad\" was heavily lauded by contemporary music critics, who stated that it was the best song of Björk's career. The song's lyrical content, vocal performance and experimentation in its production and composition were also highly praised. \n\nThe song was moderately successful in the countries it charted in, including Finland, Australia, United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom (where it was the last of three top ten hits, after \"Army of Me\" and \"It's Oh So Quiet\"). A music video was released for the single, featuring a digitalized Björk running and falling from a cliff.\n\nBjörk performed the song at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York, which was recorded by Sylvia Massy for Capitol Records. This live version was subsequently included on the second disc of the Tibetan Freedom Concert album released later that year.\n\n\"Hyperballad\" was written by Björk and co-produced by her and Nellee Hooper, who had contributed in other Björk albums. Like the rest of the album, recording sessions of the song were set in Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to save tax money. Musically, the song alters from folktronica to acid house. The chords and lyrics in the verses move in three bar phrases. The choruses are in four bar phrases. It combines a house beat with a string section conducted by Brazilian musician Eumir Deodato. Heather Phares from AllMusic compared the song to the work of Aphex Twin. \n\nLorraine Ali from \"Rolling Stone\" said that Björk \"turns fantasy into morbid but honest wonderment for 'Hyperballad.' Here's what she sings over a sweeping, panoramic vista: 'I imagine what my body would sound like slamming against the rocks, and when it lands, will my eyes be closed or open?'\" \n\nA reviewer from Sputnikmusic said, \"The lines inspiration and importance are mysterious to everyone but Björk herself. As “Hyper-Ballad” begins to draw to an end the rhythmic beat begins to pick up pace and gives hypnotic vibe, while at the same time features elements of dance music.\"\n\nWhile listing the song at number #69 on their 100 Best Songs of the 1990s, a reviewer from \"NME\" said \"'Hyperballad' was an earnest attempt to try and make old love alive once more. She said it was about the art of \"not forgetting about yourself\" in a relationship and this was reflected in the music which altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house.\"\n\nIn the lyrics, Björk describes living at the top of a mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. Björk stated that \"I feel that words can have a mysticism or a hidden meaning. On Hyperballad, the idea that I'm throwing car parts from a cliff is about getting out my frustrations.\"\n\nBjörk explains: \"I guess that song is about when you're in a relationship and it's going really well and you're really happy and maybe you have given up parts of yourself. To fall in love and be in a relationship for a long time is like giving a lot of parts of you away because the relationship becomes more important than you as individuals. It's a bit of a tricky balance. I think everyone in a relationship needs to know not to forget themselves...\" (from an interview by David Hemingway)\n\nShe also explained how the song relates to the hiding of an aggressive part of oneself from a lover.\n\n\"Hyperballad\" was heavily acclaimed from music critics. Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine was favorable, saying \"Without missing a beat, Björk puts herself into the role of fragile suicidist on \"Hyper-Ballad,\" as she throws tchotchkes over a cliff to approximate the nature of her own plunge. A phenomenal journey, the track begins with lightly shuffling drum n' bass before expanding into an immense house groove.\" \n\nMike Diver from BBC Music said \"Hyper-Ballad – single four of six taken from this 11-tracker – is similarly striking, and remains among the very finest songs in Björk’s canon [...] perfectly is an indelibly excellent example of music meeting art. It’s a benchmark of successful audio-visual synergy.\" Glenn Swan from Allmusic gave it a separate review, and awarded it 4 stars out of five, making it Björk's highest viewed single on the website.\n\n\"Drowned In Sound\" listed it at number #8 on their top ten Björk singles. \"XFM Radio\" listed it at number 686 on their The XFM Top 1,000 Songs Of All Time.\n\n\"Hyperballad\" was the song receiving most votes from Björk fans on the overall survey for her \"Greatest Hits\" album's song list. In September 2010, Pitchfork Media included the song at number #11 on their \"Top 200 Tracks of the 90s\".\n\nThe video was directed by Michel Gondry. It features Björk as a video game character who runs through an obscure, two-dimensional landscape of pylons before throwing herself off a cliff. This sequence, along with several others (including blinking lights and some of herself performing the song), are projected onto a three-dimensional shot of Björk lying amongst a mountainous landscape.\n\nThe video was filmed at Telecine Cell in London, using a motion control system. The entire video and all the effects were shot on a single 400 ft roll of film, by multiple exposure and frame-accurate backwinding of the film strip. The graphics were shot as a series of secondary exposures using a television monitor, and the flashing lights were created with an LED strip board, also exposed on the same piece of film. At Gondry's insistence, no edits were made after the film was exposed; the only post processing consisted of colour correction during transfer of the piece to videotape.\n\nBjörk sings live in the video. This new vocal take was later featured in the CD2 of the Hyperballad single, and in the 5.1 edition of \"Surrounded\". Mike Diver from BBC Music gave it a positive review, saying \"its accompanying video is a masterstroke of suggestive simplicity, evocative elegance; that it suits its skittering beats and contorting vocal [...]\" \n\nA reviewer, D File, wrote: \"Due partially to my personal puzzlement in understanding this video and the construction of its imagery, I’ve concluded that 'Hyperballad' is, if nothing else, one of the most avant-garde pieces of music video in the late 20th century. At one glance, the composites completely coalesce with the elements of the song. Yet the imagery is so transcendent of any other pop promo. Upside, inside out.\"\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Hyperballad\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThe song has been covered by many artists. Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Ladybird Sideshow, and Glen Phillips covered it during their live shows. Peruvian band Ni Voz Ni Voto covered it for their Unplugged Album Acustico 2002, Greg Dulli and his band The Twilight Singers covered it in their album of 2004, \"She Loves You\". \n\nJohn Nolan covered this song at Kevin Devine's Record Release Party in 2005. Big Heavy Stuff covers this song on \"Like a Version\", a compilation album by the Australian radio station Triple J. Tori Amos covered parts of this song as an intro or bridge to \"Butterfly\". She also covered a full version on her \"Summer of Sin\" tour.\n\nBrodsky Quartet contributed their talents to a remix of the song, which first appeared on Björk's \"Post\" album, and later on \"Telegram\". The song is mistitled \"Hyperballad (Brodski Quartet Version)\" on all pressings of the limited two CD edition Australian of \"Post\".\n\nIndonesian band Mocca covered this song on their album of 2007, \"Colours\". The same year also saw an Australian collaboration album named \"No Man's Woman\", featured male vocalists covering some of the most famous songs performed by women. Folk singer Whitley delivered an arrangement of Hyperballad for this project. In 2008, the Spanish group Celtas Cortos made a cover of it in their album \"40 de abril\", under the title of \"Abismo\" (meaning \"Cliff\"). Dirty Projectors also covered the song on \"Enjoyed: A Tribute to Björk's Post\".\n\nJapanese singer-songwriter UA covered Hyperballad on her 2010 album .\n\nIn 2010, Robyn performed a cover of the song at the Polar Music Prize ceremony, when Björk and Ennio Morricone were awarded the prize. In jazz, the song has been covered by Marcin Wasilewski, Slawomir Kurkiewicz, and Michal Miskiewicz on their album of 2004, \"Trio\", and by the Verneri Pohjola Quartet on the album of 2012 \"Ancient History\".\n\nBritish singer Matt Fishel recorded a choral a cappella cover of the song. After receiving numerous requests from his fans to release it officially after he originally uploaded it to his MySpace page in the mid 2000s, Fishel's cover was eventually released on his 2014 covers EP \"Cover Boy\".\nIn July 2014, Tori Amos covered the song on her \"Unrepentant Geraldines Tour\".\n\n"}

After the war he settled in Duanesburg, New York, where he married.\n\nHe was appointed adjutant general of the United States Army with the rank of brigadier general on July 19, 1798, but was mustered out on June 10, 1800, as tensions with France diminished. In March 1812, he was again appointed adjutant-general of the Army, but declined.\n\nNorth and a fellow aide-de-camp, Captain Benjamin Walker, were formally adopted by Steuben, and made his heirs. Some historians believe that these 'extraordinary intense emotional relationships' were romantic, and given Steuben's reported earlier behaviour, it has been suggested it would have been out-of-character for him if they were not. However, based on the limited historical record, it is impossible to prove. Following Baron Steuben's death, North divided the property bequeathed to him among his military companions.\n\nHe was a member of the New York State Assembly from Albany County in 1792, 1794 and 1795, from Albany and Schenectady Counties in 1796, and from Schenectady County in 1810. He was Speaker in 1795, 1796 and 1810. North was appointed as a Federalist to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Sloss Hobart and served from May 5, 1798, to August 17, 1798, when James Watson was elected and qualified to succeed.\n\nHe was a member of the first Erie Canal Commission, from 1810 to 1816.\n\nOn October 14, 1787, North married Mary Duane (b. 1762), the daughter of James Duane (1733–1797), the 44th Mayor of New York City and U.S. District Judge for the District of New York, appointed by George Washington. Together, they had six children.\n\nThe General William North House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.\n\nGeneral North was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He died in New York City, and was buried in the crypt under the Christ Episcopal Church in Duanesburg.\n\n"}

This includes the use or absence of stagecraft elements as well as the structure of the stage and its components.\n\nStaging is also used to mean the result of this process, in other words the spectacle that a play presents in performance, its visual detail. This can include such things as positions of actors on stage (often referred to as blocking), their gestures and movements (also called stage business), the scenic background, the props and costumes, lighting, and sound effects. Besides costume, any physical object that appears in a play has the potential to become an important dramatic symbol. The first thing that the audience of a play sees is the stage set, the physical objects that suggest the world of the play. The stage set is usually indicated by the playwright, but the degree of detail and specificity of this rendering vary from one playwright to another and from one literary period to another. In film, staging is generally called \"set dressing\".\n\nWhile from a critical standpoint, \"staging\" can refer to the spectacle that a play presents in performance, the term is also frequently used interchangeably with the term \"blocking\", referring to how the performers are placed and moved around the stage. Many audience members may believe that performers move spontaneously on the stage, but blocking/staging is rarely spontaneous. Major points of blocking are often set down by the playwright, but blocking is usually done by the director, sometimes in collaboration with performers and designers. In the modern theater, there are purely mechanical reasons why blocking is crucial. Stage lighting is focused on specific parts of the stage at specific moments, and the performer must be sure to be on his or her \"mark\" or \"spike\" or they may not be well lit. Blocking also ensures that the stage picture gives the proper focus to the proper places, and that transitions occur smoothly. This becomes even more crucial as modern stage technology allows for ever more elaborate special effects.\n\nWhen Twentieth Century Fox introduced wide-screen CinemaScope format, the head of production Darryl Zanuck repeatedly reminded his directors to take full advantage of the screen width by staging action all the way across the frame - in his words, 'keep the people spread out'. He wanted the audience to experience the full width of the new screen shape. The 'washing line' staging demanded by Zanuck not only was a commercial imperative, it also was a practical solution for the lack of color film sensitivity as well for inability to employ deep staging.\n\n"}

It often uses brains and organ meats such as calf's head or a calf's foot to duplicate the texture and flavour of the original's turtle meat.\n\"Mrs. Fowle's Mock Turtle Soup\":\n\nTake a large calf's head. Scald off the hair. Boil it until the horn is tender, then cut it into slices about the size of your finger, with as little lean as possible. Have ready three pints of good mutton or veal broth, put in it half a pint of Madeira wine, half a teaspoonful of thyme, pepper, a large onion, and the peel of a lemon chop't very small. A ¼ of a pint of oysters chop't very small, and their liquor; a little salt, the juice of two large onions, some sweet herbs, and the brains chop't. Stand all these together for about an hour, and send it up to the table with the forcemeat balls made small and the yolks of hard eggs.\nIn the Oldenburg and Ammerland regions of Germany, \"\"—the English designation \"mock turtle\" retained—is a traditional meal, dating from the time of the personal union between the Kingdom of Hanover and the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nWhile green sea turtle was popular for soup making in many countries, U.S. recipes included many other local species. Soup made from snapping turtles is still available in certain parts of the country. Similarly, mock turtle soup recipes have a variety of substitute meats. Besides organ meats like the British recipes, recipes in the U.S. often use stewing beef or ground beef, but may call for alligator. \n\nThe Campbell Soup Company once produced canned mock turtle soup made of calf's head. In a 1962 interview with David Bourdon, Andy Warhol, commenting on Campbell's discontinued soups, said that Mock Turtle had once been his favorite. An American version of the soup is popular in Cincinnati and canned under the name Worthmore's Mock Turtle Soup.\n\n\n"}

At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, it has a population of 24,764. The main attraction of Banepa is the temple of \nChandeshwori, located approximately northeast of the town along the Rudramati River. The Dhaneshwor Temple is 1 km south of the town. Banepa is also known for its eight different temples of Lord Ganesh, Narayanthan (the temple of Lord Narayan), Bhimshenthan (the temple of Lord Bhimshen) and eight different ponds.\n\nSome of the ancient names of Banepa were Banepur, Baniyapur, Banipur. As it had trade relationship with Tibet from ancient period, Banepa is also known as \"Bhont\", \"Bhonta\", \"Bhon dey (भोंदेय्)\". Banepa is the combination of two words i.e. \"Bane\" means 'Business' and \"Pa\" means 'Place'. Therefore, \"Banepa\" means 'Place of Business'.\n\nIt is believed that when entire Kathmandu Valley was covered with lake, there was a settlement in \"Banepa\".\n\nBy early Lichchavi period (5th-8th century), settlements existed at Sanga (Sangagrama), Banepa (Ninaapa), Nala, Panauti, Khopasi, Palanchowk, Dumja and probably Dolakha, Lele (Lembatidrangga), Chitlang valley and even up to Gorkha. (Slusser, 1982).\n\nThakuri period (879 – 1200 A.D.) : Bhaktapur and Banepa was the core political area.\n\nMalla Period (1200–1769 A.D.) : King Anandedeva Malla united the scattered villages and made modern Banepa surrounded by eight gates with a Ganesh (the elephant-headed god of good omen) at each of the gates in eight different directions in Kaligat Year 4197 (around 1153 B.S.). He also built a temple of Chandeshwori and arranged a trust fund for the goddess. \n\nAfter having had the favours and directions of goddess Chandeshwori, King Anandadeva Malla founded seven villages (सात गाँउ), viz,\n\n\nThe old Newa: town is located at the central part of the City. It is surrounded by 8 ganesh temples with 8 adjacent ponds and Phalchaa (फल्चा).\nThe name of the Ganesh temples are:\n\nThese Ganesh temples are said to be the boundaries of old Banepa. The main temple of Banepa city was Chandeswori Temple along the Rudramati River.\n\nAlong with this, King Ananda Dev Malla also built wells and taps for providing the people of Banepa with the good source of water. But many of those ponds have been used for public uses and some 'Phalchaa' do not have any existence today.\n\nA lot of festivals are celebrated in Banepa as follows:\n\nAbove mentioned festivals are still in practice. But there were many other besides these which had been discontinued due to various reasons. Some of those festivals are listed as follows:\nPunyamata River, which was the major source of drinking water, irrigation and many other activities, is being polluted day by day. The bank of Punyamata River has been a place where solid wastage has been disposed. The sewage has been connected directly to the river without any treatment and in an unmanaged way has adversely affected the river water. Waste materials produced from local industry have turned the river water black. The surrounding countryside is also being polluted.\n\nAlthough Banepa is a small place of an area of , it has got the population density of . Due to the connection of Banepa with other places through roadways, about 300 buses, minibuses, cars, trucks, motorcycles altogether are helping in the transportation in a day.

All the three cities have been declared as the 'Cyber City'.\n\nBanepa has a Seventh-day Adventist hospital called Scheer Memorial Hospital, which was established in 1957. This hospital has been expanded as a medical college associated with Vanderbilt University in the US and Kathmandu University. Many students enroll in the B.Sc. Nursing programs at this hospital. Banepa is also the location of the Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre for Disabled Children and Reiyukai Eiko Masunaga Eye Hospital.\n\nBanepa is a major trade route to Tibet, with the Arniko Rajmarg, the only highway that connects Nepal and China (Tibet), running through this town. Furthermore, B.P. Koirala Highway also passes through Banepa. Though it is a small town, but it is well devolved and Banepa is the major economic center east of Kathmandu.\n\nTo promote local culture, Banepa has two FM radio stations: Radio ABC, which is a Community Radio Station and Prime Fm.

He subsequently became known as the Father of Reform. His younger brother Edmund Cartwright became famous as the inventor of the power loom.\n\nHe was born at Marnham in Nottinghamshire, being the elder brother of Edmund Cartwright, inventor of the power loom and the younger brother of George Cartwright, trader and explorer of Labrador. He was educated at Newark-on-Trent grammar school and Heath Academy in Yorkshire, and at the age of eighteen entered the Royal Navy.\n\nHe was present, in his first year of service, at the capture of Cherbourg, and served in the following year in the Battle of Quiberon Bay between Sir Edward Hawke and Admiral Hubert de Brienne. Engaged afterwards under Sir Hugh Palliser and Admiral John Byron on the Newfoundland Station, he was appointed to act as chief magistrate of the settlement. He served in the post for five years (1765–1770).\n\nFrom 1763 to 14 May 1766, Cartwright was commander of HM Cutter \"Sherborne\". His brother George, when at loose ends, went with him on a cruise out of Plymouth to chase smugglers in \"Sherborne\".\n\nIll-health necessitated Cartwright's retirement from active service for a time in 1771.\n\nWhen the disputes with the American colonies began, he believed that the colonists had right on their side, warmly supported their cause and, at the outbreak of the ensuing American War of Independence, refused an appointment as first lieutenant to the Duke of Cumberland. Thus he gave up a path to certain promotion, since he did not wish to fight against the cause which he felt to be just. \nIn 1774 he published his first plea on behalf of the colonists, entitled \"American Independence the Glory and Interest of Great Britain.\"\n\nHe married in 1780. He adopted his niece Frances Dorothy Cartwright, daughter of his brother Edmund.\n\nIn 1765, when the Nottinghamshire Militia was first raised, he was appointed major, and in this capacity he served for seventeen years. He was at last illegally superseded.\n\nIn 1779 appeared his first work on reform in parliament, which, with the exception of Earl Stanhope's pamphlets (1774), appears to have been the earliest publication on the subject. It was entitled, \"Take your Choice\", a second edition appearing under the new title of \"The Legislative Rights of the Commonalty Vindicated\", and advocated annual parliaments, the secret ballot and manhood suffrage.\n\nThe task of his life was thenceforth chiefly the attainment of universal suffrage and annual parliaments. \nIn 1798, he conceived the project of a political association, which took shape in 1780 as the Society for Constitutional Information, including among its members some of the most distinguished men of the day. \nFrom this society sprang the more famous London Corresponding Society. \nMajor Cartwright worked unweariedly for the promotion of reform. \nHe was one of the witnesses on the trial of his friends, John Horne Tooke, John Thelwall and Thomas Hardy, in 1794.\nHe left his large estate in Lincolnshire in 1803 or 1805\n\nIn 1812, he initiated the Hampden Clubs, named after John Hampden, an English Civil War Parliamentary leader, aiming to bring together middle class moderates and lower class radicals in the reform cause. To promote the idea, he toured northwest England later in 1812, in 1813 (getting arrested in Huddersfield) and in 1815. He recruited John Knight who founded the first Hampden Club in Lancashire. In 1818, Knight, John Saxton and James Wroe formed the reformist and popularist newspaper the \"Manchester Observer\". In 1819, the same team formed the Patriotic Union Society, which invited Henry \"Orator\" Hunt and Major Cartwright to speak at a reformist public rally in Manchester, but the elderly Cartwright was unable to attend what became the Peterloo Massacre. Later in 1819, Cartwright was arrested for speaking at a parliamentary reform meeting in Birmingham, indicted for conspiracy and was condemned to pay a fine of £100.\n\nCartwright then wrote \"The English Constitution\", which outlined his ideas including government by the people and legal equality which he considered could only be achieved by universal suffrage, the secret ballot and equal electoral districts. He became the main patron of the Radical publisher Thomas Jonathan Wooler, best known for his satirical journal \"The Black Dwarf\", who actively supported Cartwright's campaigning.\n\nCartwright had sent a copy of \"The English Constitution\" to former President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson wrote to Cartwright in July: \"Your age of eighty-four, and mine of eighty-one years, ensure us a speedy meeting. We may then commune at leisure, and more fully, on the good and evil, which in the course of our long lives, we have both witnessed; and in the mean time, I pray you to accept assurances of my high veneration and esteem for your person and character\". \n\nIn 1788, Major Cartwight sold his heavily mortgaged estates at Marnham, buying others at Brothertoft, Lincolnshire. The same year with 18 others, he erected a large mill at the bottom of Spital Hill in Retford. It was called the Revolution Mill in celebration of the centenary of the Glorious Revolution. He hoped to weave cloth using the weaving patents of his brother Edmund Cartwright. He also began the mechanical spinning of wool, or rather worsted. This business was not successful. The mill stood idle within a few years and was advertised to sale in 1798 and 1805. The mill was later largely demolished and only one building remains.\n\nCartwright took a keen interest in agricultural improvement and used his estate at Brothertoft to conduct crop trials and to develop new agricultural implements, several of which were invented by his bailiff and later estate steward, William Amos. He also turned over a large part of his estate to the cultivation of woad, creating dedicated buildings and improving the apparatus used to process the crop.\n\nCartwright died in London on 23 September 1824, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Finchley, north London. In 1835, a monument to him was erected in the churchyard, paid for by public subscription. It is a Grade II listed building, but is on the English Heritage Heritage at Risk Register due to its dangerous condition. There is a plan (2018) to restore it.\n\nIn 1831, a monument from a design by Macdowell was erected to him in Bloomsbury, London, where he had lived. Burton Crescent, the original name of the street, was later renamed Cartwright Gardens in his honour. His statue faces a student hall of residence and backs onto tennis courts and a terrace of houses, most of which serve as small hotels.\n\nCaptain George Vancouver named Cartwright Sound, on the west coast of Graham Island in the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia, Canada, in his honour in relation to his Royal Navy service under Admiral Howe.\n\nThe \"Life and Correspondence of Major Cartwright\", edited by his niece Frances Dorothy Cartwright, was published in 1826. John Cartwright House, built in 1976 on the Mansford Estate in Bethnal Green, was named in his honour. The estate was built by Tower Hamlets Council and a number of the blocks were named after social and political reformers. In 2006, the Estate transferred to Tower Hamlets Community Housing, a local housing association.\n\n"}

An active station from 1929 to 1979, the 17-story Art Deco style station was designed by architects Fellheimer & Wagner for the New York Central Railroad. After years of abandonment, it is now owned by the non-profit preservation group Central Terminal Restoration Corporation, which is working to restore and re-purpose the complex. The Central Terminal is located in the city of Buffalo's Broadway/Fillmore district.\n\nThe terminal is located about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) from downtown Buffalo, and consists of several structures, some of which are connected, while others were formerly interconnected.\n\nThe main concourse is 225 feet (69 m) long, 66 feet (21 m) wide, and 58.5 feet (17.8 m) tall (63.5 feet [19.4 m] at the domed ends). The concourse included various rental spaces; a restaurant with a dining room, lunch room, and coffee shop; a Western Union telegraph office; and a soda fountain, along with standard station necessities. Off the concourse there is a streetcar lobby and waiting room. Curtiss Street runs directly below the concourse, but has been closed since the late 1980s for safety reasons. The concourse is currently owned by the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation.\n\nThe train concourse is long and includes 14 low-level platforms. Each platform is accessed by a staircase and a ramp. The train concourse is owned by Amtrak, with the land being owned by CSX. In 1982, the bridge which connected the train concourse and passenger platforms from the terminal and main concourse was demolished to allow passage of high freight cars on the Belt Line. The rest of the concourse remains.\n\nThe office tower is 15 stories, excluding the main floor, and mezzanine. The 271-foot (83 m) building is owned by the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation.\n\nThe baggage building on Curtiss Street is owned by the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation. It is a five-story building immediately adjacent to the Main Concourse. The mail building along Curtiss Street is owned by the City of Buffalo. It is a two-story building adjacent to the Baggage Building.\n\nThe Railway Express Agency was the early forerunner of today's Federal Express and UPS. The building is located behind the Mail Building of the complex and is by far the most decayed building. Trains would pull directly into the building to proceed with the load/unloading of goods. This building is currently owned by the City of Buffalo, which has confirmed plans to demolish it.\n\nOther buildings included a Pullman Company service building, an ice house, and a coach shop, all of which were torn down in 1966 to lower property taxes.\n\nThe first building built as part of the project was a cogeneration power station that provided heat and electricity to the complex, even during construction. It contained three 28-foot (8.5 m) coal boilers. The building's smokestack was dismantled in 1966 to save on taxes. The power plant itself lasted up until the mid-1980s, with its exact demise not known.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Buffalo had several railroad stations, and there were calls for a single union station. In 1889, a Union Station was proposed to be built on the site of the future Central Terminal, but it never happened.\n\nThe New York Central Railroad (NYC) had two stations in Buffalo in the early 20th century: the Exchange Street Station and the Terrace Station. Both of these downtown stations were old—Exchange Street dated to before the American Civil War—and were plagued with downtown congestion.\n\nNYC decided to build the new Buffalo Central Terminal to the east, in order to relieve both rail and grade crossing congestion and to be more conveniently located for trains not terminating in Buffalo. A roomier area would also ease the transfer of sleeping cars between trains. Furthermore, Buffalo was a quickly growing city at the time, and it was believed that before long Central Terminal's area would become closer to the center of a sprawling metropolis of 1.5 million people. The city was not so sure, but planning was well underway in 1924, despite the lack of an agreement at the time.\n\nNYC finalized its decision to build the terminal in 1925, and site preparation began the following year. NYC President Patrick Crowley hired Alfred T. Fellheimer and Steward Wagner to build the actual station in 1927. The total cost of the project was $14 million. Prior to the building of the station, the site was bounded to the south by the New York Central main line, to the northwest by the NYC's West Shore Railroad, and to the east by the NYC's Junction Railroad. When the station was built, the West Shore was abandoned between the NYC main line and the Junction Railroad, being rerouted via the other two lines and the new station. The former West Shore right-of-way is now Memorial Drive.\n\nA grand celebration attended by 2,200 invited guests on June 22, 1929, opened the station. Speakers included Henry Thornton and Frank X. Schwab. Although an eastbound \"Empire State Express\" departed the station at 2:10 PM, the train was not a regular one, and was really just ceremonial. The station did not open until the celebration ended at 3:30, and scheduled service began on June 23.\n\nIn the early days, the station was served not only by the owner, but also by the Canadian National Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Railway.\n\nWhen the NYC operated the \"20th Century Limited\", Central Terminal was located approximately 44 miles (71 km) east of the half-way point from New York City to Chicago, and the trains would pass each other near there.\n\nFor most of Central Terminal's history, far too trains stopped there to justify the use of such a large facility. Although it started with 200 trains daily, the Great Depression began less than a year after its construction, and the rise in automobile use also hurt passenger levels.\n\nThere was a burst of activity during World War II when the station had a reasonable amount of train traffic for its size. Notable trains making daily calls at the station include the \"Wolverine\", \"Interstate Express\", the \"Ohio State Limited\", the \"Lake Shore Limited\", the \"20th Century Limited\" (engine crew-change stop only), the \"New England States\", the \"Boston Express\", the \"Empire State Express\", \"Southwestern Limited,\" among many others.\n\nAfter the war, the station entered into what would be a permanent decline, amid the larger decline in train travel across the country. As early as 1956, the New York Central offered the terminal for sale for one million dollars. A company called Buffprop Enterprises did negotiate a 25-year lease of the terminal in 1959, but it ended the following year. Service to Niagara Falls, New York, ended by 1961.\n\nIn 1966, the continuing decrease in passenger revenues caused NYC to demolish parts of the Terminal complex, including the Pullman service building, coach shop and ice house. In 1968, the NYC merged with the PRR to form Penn Central Transportation (PC), which operated the terminal until the creation of Amtrak in 1971.\n\nThe bankrupt PC was absorbed by Conrail in April 1976. In 1978, Amtrak restored direct service to Niagara Falls. One train per day connected with Via Rail Canada/Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway service to Toronto–forerunner of today's \"Maple Leaf\". The financially strapped passenger carrier was in no position to rehabilitate Central Terminal, resulting in the reopening of Buffalo-Exchange Street station near downtown for the \"Empire Service\" route, including the connecting service to Toronto, further marginalizing use of Central Terminal. This left Central Terminal with only two routes–the Chicago-bound \"Lake Shore Limited\" and the Detroit-bound \"Niagara Rainbow.\" The four daily trains did not even begin to justify such a large station; Amtrak had to spend $150,000 per year on heating bills alone. Rather than spend the massive sums necessary to rehabilitate Central Terminal, Amtrak replaced it in 1979 with the much smaller Buffalo-Depew station, 10 miles east of downtown. The last train that called at Central Terminal was the westbound \"Lake Shore Limited\", which departed at 4:10 am on October 28.\n\nThe building was sold to Anthony T. Fedele, a local builder, for $75,000 in 1979. Fedele planned a 150-room hotel, offices and restaurants for the terminal complex that would have been called \"Central Terminal Plaza\" but could not find investors for the project. Fedele also lived in the building creating an apartment for himself in the tower on the second floor. While the building was under the control of Fedele it was reasonably taken care of.\n\nIt was during this time that the railroad tenant left. Conrail closed its Terminal general offices in 1980. The Conrail Dispatching Department was the last business to leave the Terminal in 1984. Two interlocking towers, numbered 48 and 49, that serviced the tracks on the property were shut down in 1985.\n\nIn November 1983, in a sign of things to come, the building was in danger of being sold out from under Anthony Fedele by the IRS for back taxes. Fedele made an attempt at settling the debt by paying $10,200 toward the $142,128 due, and agreed to pay $2000 a month until the debt was paid in full. While he owned the building it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 3, 1984.\n\nIn 1986, Anthony Fedele defaulted on his taxes and US Bankruptcy Court Judge John W. Creahan ordered a foreclosure sale. The Buffalo Central Terminal was put up for auction and won by Thomas Telesco, the only bidder, for $100,000. Telesco talked about turning it into a banquet hall and using it as a station on a proposed high-speed rail line linking New York and Toronto. He later began the process of selling the architectural artifacts and other items of value from the building.\nThe building was then acquired by Bernie Tuchman and his uncle, Samuel Tuchman. This period was one of great decay for the Terminal. The Terminal's main buildings were subject to extensive artifact removal. Once a truck was being used to remove ceiling lights when it backed into the famous plaster bison statue in the concourse, smashing it. Artifacts removed and sold included iron railings, signs, lights and mailboxes. Further, the building was not secured, and vandalism was extensive, and even included some arson attempts. It is said that the only thing that saved the building was the fact that demolition would have been too expensive ($12 million).\n\nReacting to complaints and questions from preservationists in Buffalo, the owners responded, \"If you think you could do a better job, I'll sell it to you for a dollar.\"\n\nScott Field of the Preservation Coalition of Erie County bought the building in August 1997 for the purchase price of $1 and assumption of approximately $70,000 in back taxes. Shortly afterward, the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation (CTRC) was formed and currently owns the Concourse, Tower and Baggage Building.\n\nThe CTRC is a non-profit, volunteer organization whose goal is to preserve the Terminal and help promote it as a viable redevelopment opportunity in the City of Buffalo. The CTRC received money to restore and relight the exterior tower clocks located on the 10th floor, relighting them on October 1, 1999. Also in 1999, a state grant for $1 million was obtained to begin the process of sealing and protecting the complex. The top of the building was re-lit starting on May 11, 2001. In 2003, the building was re-opened for public tours.\n\nCurrently, the Buffalo Central Terminal is host to approximately forty major fundraising events each year. Work continues to progress and new areas of the building are cleaned up and reopened to the public each year. Since 2003 over 100,000 people have visited the building. This is more than the local Frank Lloyd Wright properties of Western New York have had. The building has been a host to tours, art shows, local political events, train shows, annual Dyngus Day and Oktoberfest, weddings, as well as a temporary art installation by controversial artist Spencer Tunick in 2004.\n\nThe clock in the center of the concourse, sold by earlier owners, was located in Chicago in 2003. In late 2004, the clock was purchased for $25,000 through fundraising organized by WBEN and a donation from M&T Bank. The clock was on display in the Terminal during the 2005 event season. In the fall of 2005, it was relocated to the lobby of M&T Center in downtown Buffalo, where it remained until spring of 2009. The clock was then moved back to its original location in the Terminal concourse where it will sit permanently on public display.\n\nIn November 2005, Red Scream Films LLC shot their first feature film \"Prison of the Psychotic Damned\" in the Terminal. The low budget film details what happens when a group of dysfunctional ghost-hunters decide to spend a night in the long rumored to be haunted structure. A benefit sneak-peek screening of the film with all proceeds going to the CTRC was held June 23, 2006, at 6pm. The film company returned to the Terminal in August to shoot part of their third feature \"FrightWorld\"\n\nThe paranormal investigators, The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS), visited the terminal for about a week in June 2008 and aired their findings on \"Ghost Hunters\" (Episode 417 - \"Speaking With the Dead\"), September 24, 2008. Footage taken during this investigation shows that, aside from the main concourse, the entire complex is still currently in a state of heavy disrepair. The spin-off show \"Ghost Hunters Academy\" visited the terminal for the episode broadcast December 2, 2009. On October 31, 2010 (Halloween), \"Ghost Hunters\" aired a live 6-hour broadcast from the station.\n\nIn 2016 Toronto based developer Harry Stinson was named by the CTRC as the designated developer for Buffalo's Central Terminal to re-develop the Terminal complex. Stinson's proposal included turning the Terminal into a mixed use facility and also included building townhouses in the surrounding neighborhood to create a village like atmosphere with proceeds being invested into terminal restoration. The proposal also offered the possibility of restoring rail services to the terminal.\n\nOn May 5, 2017, after numerous delays the CTRC cut ties with Stinson in favor of working with the Urban Land Institute on a new redevelopment plan.\n\nIn October 2017, the World Monuments Fund selected Central Terminal as part of its 2018 World Monument Watch List, one of two selections from the United States and one of 25 selections total.\n\nIn 2018, two hundred solar panels were installed at the terminal restoring commercial grade electric to the facility.\n\nMultiple ideas and plans have been proposed for Central Terminal's future. A master plan was established in 2009 by the CTRC that entailed their vision for the future of the terminal. In 2013 the CTRC announced the reuse plan for the terminal stating \"Although much work needs to be done to stabilize and prepare the complex for tenancy and other use, various groups have toured the complex and have expressed interest in becoming anchor tenants or partner developers utilizing a Public/Private Development concept.\" Remedial measures and repairs, replacements and new technologies are part of the plan for the Center. Roof replacement is currently underway with an Energy Star compliant membrane being laid down and a solar Photovoltaic system being installed in the future. The Terminal is experiencing great in-kind development and services with local businesses and trade unions. Other immediate projects include restoration of the Guastavino Tile in the Main Concourse; Brownfields remediation plan and general utilities and improvements. The CTRC is looking forward to the additional historic restoration and remediation of all masonry and windows along with new systems for HVAC utilizing Green Technologies.\n\nAlthough the project does not rely on it happening, it is the ultimately the CTRC's hope that, with the reuse of the Terminal, rail traffic will also be forthcoming whether starting with interest in the possible reuse of Buffalo's legendary Belt Line; local light rail expansion and the future of the Terminal's reuse as a connector hub for possible high-speed rail. The Central Terminal Restoration Corporation, in cooperation with local, state, and federal government representatives, are working to position the Terminal to be Buffalo's high-speed rail station as well as the potential return of Amtrak service. Buffalo, New York is part of the Empire Corridor, one of only ten Federally designated high-speed rail corridors in the United States.\n\nIn September 2016, the roof of the downtown Exchange Street Amtrak station collapsed. This led to calls for a new train station in Buffalo and a discussion of moving the stop back to the Central Terminal. Congressman Brian Higgins called for a study for a new train station to be done at both Central Terminal and a site at Canalside saying about the terminal \"It may not have been possible 15 years ago, but restoration of the Central Terminal is possible in the new Buffalo.\" \"In the enormous scale of that redevelopment project, it may be possible to carve out a small 'station-within-a-station' that would squarely and singularly focus on providing a highly functional train station to meet current and projected needs. This (the Central Terminal) location would allow the restoration of service to Chicago within the city limits, and it certainly merits a meaningful engineering review.\" Higgins' call was later reinforced by Senator Charles Schumer.\n\nOn October 5, 2016, Congressman Higgins along with Buffalo Common Council Member David Franczyk toured the terminal with Mark A. Lewandowski, president of the CTRC. Higgins came out in support of the station at the terminal as part of a larger redevelopment plan. A public campaign to bring Amtrak back to the Central Terminal was launched complete with a website and social media.\n\nA plan to return Amtrak to the Central Terminal could possibly later add a long discussed NFTA Metro Rail extension from Downtown to the Buffalo Niagara International Airport which would include stops at the Central Terminal as well as the Walden Galleria. This would connect the Central Terminal to the airport as well as to the heart of downtown. On April 17, 2017, a 17-member panel including Buffalo mayor Byron Brown approved by a margin of 10-4 approved a downtown replacement close to the existing Exchange Street station over the terminal in a decision seen as controversial. The station site and the Central Terminal became part of a political debate with candidates running in the upcoming mayoral election against Brown promising a reversal of this decision if elected.\n\nIn May, 2017 the CTRC, City of Buffalo and New York State decided to have the Urban Land Institute study the terminal, neighborhood and uses for the Terminal and report their findings in hope of developing a plan. The Urban Land institute is the body responsible for the successful reuse of Buffalo's Richardson Olmsted Complex. The group's comprehensive study of the Terminal complex was fast-tracked, with a projected completion by June 30, 2017. The process included a panel of experts who will be in Buffalo for a week to conduct interviews and make a concluding presentation. The panel concluded that a strategy needs to be developed with one of the first steps including creating a development plan for the East Side. ULI also suggested having a master plan for the building which includes breaking down the minimum cost of repairing and stabilizing each part of the former train station. Suggestions for use included having the concourse reopen to the public with a restored restaurant as a year round venue as well as beautifying the green space and creating a park. Looking longer term, 6 to 20 years, their suggestions included enhancing Fillmore Avenue and reusing vacant lots around the area. No suggestions were made for the tower or baggage buildings.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced $5 million in funding for a restoration of the concourse along with the creation of a year-round event space in the concourse, waiting room areas and parking accessibility along with full capacity for catering and entertainment following the Urban Land Institute recommendations. The CTRC is also expected to transition to a professional staff.\n\n\nSeveral notable statues have graced the station's space over the years. The station once had a stuffed American bison in the concourse, belonging to the Buffalo Museum of Science and used to advertise the museum. Passengers (including soldiers bound for World War II) rubbing their hands on the bison caused it to become worn, so it was removed to the Buffalo Museum of Science and replaced with a plaster cast, bronze painted statue. This statue was accidentally destroyed by an owner during abandonment. A bronze recasting from the original molds can be found outside Alumni Arena at the University at Buffalo North Campus. On October 17, 2011 the buffalo in the terminal was replaced by the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation with one made out of fiberglass donated by Mollenberg-Betz, Inc., a Western New York-based mechanical contractor and Niagara Coatings Services, who specializes in various industrial coatings.\n\nAfter the station was closed, the statue called \"Progress\" was placed on the terminal plaza by Anthony Fedele, who was the owner of the building after it closed down. The statue is said to have been of Madonna and Child. It was ruined when an attempt was made to move the statue to the Griffis Sculpture Park in East Otto, New York.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2032527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032527", "title": "Eriophorum angustifolium", "text": "Eriophorum angustifolium\n\nEriophorum angustifolium, commonly known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, perennial sedge, able to endure in a variety of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike \"Gossypium\", the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on \"E. angustifolium\" are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated \"E. angustifolium\" the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.\n\nIn the wild, \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is a creeping rhizomatous perennial sedge, with an abundance of unbranched, translucent pink roots. Fully grown, it has a tall, erect stem shaped like a narrow cylinder or triangular prism; it is smooth in texture and green in colour. Reports of the plant's height vary; estimates include up to , , and up to . \"E. angustifolium\" has \"stiff grass-like foliage\" consisting of long, narrow solidly dark green leaves, which have a single central groove, and narrow from their wide base to a triangular tip. Up to seven green and brown aerial peduncles and chaffs, roughly in size, protrude from umbels at the top of the stem from which achenes are produced after fertilisation, each with a single pappus; these combine to form a distinctive white perianth around long.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is described as \"a rather dull plant\" in winter and spring, but \"simply breathtaking\" in summer and autumn, when 1–7 conspicuous inflorescences – composed of hundreds of white pappi comparable to cotton, hair, tassels, and/or bristles – stand out against naturally drab surroundings.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" differs from other species within the genus \"Eriophorum\" in its habitat and morphology. Its multiple flower heads and growth from rhizomes distinguish it from \"E. vaginatum\", which has a single flower head and grows from dense tussocks. Although \"E. latifolium\" has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes \"E. angustifolium\" from \"E. gracile\", which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and distributed across Eurasia, North America and the British Isles, where there is open bog, heath, wetland and moorland, with standing water and calcareous peat or acidic soil. It can survive in the Subarctic and Arctic, and is found in Alaska, Finland and Greenland as far north as 83° N. The British botanist William Turner Thiselton-Dyer recorded \"E. angustifolium\" in the South African Republic in 1898.\n\nIn North America, \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is found in the north from Alaska through Manitoba and the Canadian Prairies to Newfoundland and Labrador, down the Pacific Northwest and the state of Washington, across the Midwestern United States through Michigan and Iowa, down the Eastern Seaboard as far south-east as New York and New Jersey, and reaching as far south-west as New Mexico. In Eurasia, \"E. angustifolium\" is distributed throughout the Caucasus, European Russia and North Asia, including Siberia and the Kamchatka Peninsula, and south-east to Manchuria and Korea. It grows throughout continental Europe, with the exception of those parts within the Mediterranean Basin, growing in Scandinavia in the north, and as far south as the Norte Region of Portugal and the Pierian Mountains of Greece.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is the most common of the four native species of \"Eriophorum\" in the British Isles, and has been recorded as having existed in all vice-counties, thriving particularly well in Ireland and northern and western regions of Great Britain, but less so in southern and eastern areas. In the mires of Northern Ireland and the South Pennines, it considered a ruderal, pioneer and keystone species, because it can quickly colonise and repair damaged or eroded peat, encourage the re-vegetation of its surroundings, and retain sediment and its landscape to serve as a carbon sink. In central and southern counties of England, the species is rare or absent, and was \"completely destroyed\" in Cambridgeshire, The Broads, The Fens and other parts of the East of England by human activities such as land reclamation. Within the British Isles, \"E. angustifolium\" thrives at a range of altitudes from sea-level fens and lowland meadows, to exposed upland moors when provided with a habitat of acid bog or waterlogged heath. It has an altitudinal limit of above sea level, reaching in the Wicklow Mountains of Ireland, and in the Scottish Highlands.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, perennial plant, meaning that it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back at the end of its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. \"E. angustifolium\" is protogynous.\n\nSexual reproduction in \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" begins with flowering in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually takes place in May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of \"Taraxacum\" (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving the temperature of the plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" has a NatureServe conservation status of G5, meaning that the species is considered to be ecologically secure by NatureServe, lacking any threats to its global abundance.\n\n\"Eriophorum angustifolium\" seeds and stems are edible and are used in traditional Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of \"E. angustifolium\" are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, through a process of decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat ailments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, \"E. angustifolium\" can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.\n\nIn 2002, the County Flowers campaign of Plantlife International, which asked members of the public to nominate and vote for a wildflower emblem for each of the counties and metropolitan areas of the United Kingdom, resulted in \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" being announced as the County Flower of Greater Manchester.\n\nThe species was named \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" in 1782 by the German botanist Gerhard August Honckeny. The German botanist Albrecht Wilhelm Roth published this name in 1788, referring to Honckeny's work, and is sometimes erroneously considered the author of the species name. The genus name \"Eriophorum\" consists of two Ancient Greek roots – (', \"wool\") and (', \"-bearing\") – referring to the fibrous seed-heads of the genus, which resemble tufts of thread. The specific epithet ' is composed of the Latin words ' (\"narrow\") and ' (\"leaf\"). The Linnaean name \"Eriophorum polystachion\" is a ', being based on a mixed batch of specimens. \"Scirpus angustifolius\" is a later combination published by the Japanese botanist Tetsuo Koyama in 1958, but this generic assignment is not widely accepted.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognised within \"E. angustifolium\". The autonymous subspecies, \"E. angustifolium\" subsp. \"angustifolium\", is found in more southerly sites, while \"E. angustifolium\" subsp. \"triste\" has an overlapping distribution centred further north. The two also differ in height and the roughness of the peduncles, with \"E. a.\" subsp. \"angustifolium\" being up to tall and having smooth-surfaced peduncles, while \"E. a.\" subsp. \"triste\" has rough peduncles and only reaches tall.\n\nIn English, \"E. angustifolium\" is known by a variety of common names (with various spellings), including \"common cottongrass\", \"common cotton-grass\", \"common cottonsedge\", \"tassel cotton grass\", \"many-headed cotton-grass\", \"thin-scale cotton-grass\", \"tall cotton-grass\", \"downy ling\" and \"bog cotton\".\n\nAlthough \"difficult to grow under cultivation\", The Royal Horticultural Society states \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" can be cultivated as a low-maintenance wildflower, suitable for meadows, ponds margins or bog gardens. This may be done in sheltered or exposed terrain, but best accomplished with full sun at a south- or west-facing aspect, in water up to deep. Poorly-drained peat, sand, clay or loam with an acidic soil pH is required. Division in spring is the recommended form of propagation for the species, and regular deadheading is the recommended method of pruning. \"Narthecium ossifragum\" and \"Myrica gale\" are suitable for companion planting with \"E. angustifolium\". \"Eriophorum angustifolium\" is \"generally pest free\". As a seedling and young plant it is eaten by sheep and cattle, and a variety of goose species. It is tolerant to chalybeate (iron-enriched) water, but may succumb to powdery mildews.\n\n"}
{"id": "2032557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032557", "title": "Vortex mixer", "text": "Vortex mixer\n\nA vortex mixer, or vortexer, is a simple device used commonly in laboratories to mix small vials of liquid. It consists of an electric motor with the drive shaft oriented vertically and attached to a cupped rubber piece mounted slightly off-center. As the motor runs the rubber piece oscillates rapidly in a circular motion. When a test tube or other appropriate container is pressed into the rubber cup (or touched to its edge) the motion is transmitted to the liquid inside and a vortex is created. Most vortex mixers are designed with 2 or 4-plate formats, have variable speed settings ranging from 100 to 3,200 rpm, and can be set to run continuously, or to run only when downward pressure is applied to the rubber piece.\n\nVortex mixers are quite commonplace in bioscience laboratories. In cell culture and microbiology laboratories they may be used to suspend cells. In a biochemical or analytical laboratory they may be used to mix the reagents of an assay or to mix an experimental sample and a dilutant.\n\nThe vortex mixer was invented by brothers Jack A. and Harold D. Kraft while working for Scientific Industries (a laboratory equipment manufacturer). A patent was filed by the Kraft brothers on April 6, 1959 and granted on October 30, 1962. Scientific Industries still makes a version of this original vortex mixer.\n\nAn alternative to the electric vortex mixer is the \"finger vortex\" technique in which a vortex is created manually by striking a test tube in a forward and downward motion with one's finger or thumb. This generally takes longer and often results in inadequate suspension, although it may be suitable in some cases when a vortex mixer is unavailable or the forces involved in vortexing would damage the sample, but this technique is not recommended when caustic substances are involved. The technique is better suited to accelerate the mixture of solutions which do not require the kinetic energy input needed to create suspensions.\n\nFor incubating applications, vortex mixers can employ precision temperature control at various mixing speeds which make them ideal for a wide variety of molecular biology applications including immunochemical reactions, enzyme and protein analysis, and microarray analysis.\n\n"}

These costs include potential health hazards, poor aesthetics, or reduction in home values. LULUs often gravitate to disadvantaged areas such as slums, industrial neighborhoods and poor, minority, unincorporated or politically under-represented places that cannot fight them off. Such facilities with such hazards need to be created for the greater benefits that they offer society.\n\nLULUs can include power plants, dumps (landfills), prisons, roads, factories, hospitals and many other developments. Planning seeks to distribute and reduce the harm of LULUs by zoning, environmental laws, community participation, buffer areas, clustering, dispersing and other such devices. Thus planning tries to protect property and environmental values by finding sites and operating procedures that minimize the LULU's effects.\n\n\nAn externality is something that happens as a result of a transaction that affects an uninvolved third party. LULU's present externalities in various ways, most notably those that inflict the senses: harsh smell, reduced aesthetics, noise pollution, and poor livability.\nIt has been suggested that a correlation exists between the location of sites considered as locally unwanted land uses and the proximity to minority populations as a result of market dynamics. That is, externalities associated with LULUs (such as poor aesthetics, lack of desirable amenities, etc.) tend to discourage high-earning buyers from moving to the area, and thus perpetuate the cycle in which low income individuals have few choices except those which happen to be in areas with LULUs such as landfills and highways. This tends to lower home values. Further, the same market forces, especially those that may discriminate against minorities, could make it so that these areas happen to be populated predominantly by minorities.\n\nThroughout the United States, \"three out of five African Americans and Latino Americans live in communities with abandoned toxic waste sites.\" This pattern is typically seen because of discrimination and racism throughout the infrastructure development process. It is becoming more and more common. What makes a LULU such as this unique is that they cause displacement, whereas a landfill, dump, roads, or prisons simply discourage home-buyers from entering the area and keep home prices low. High-end health food stores such as Whole Foods causes displacement by attracting high-earning home buyers into the area, causing rents and home prices to rise. This has been dubbed the \"Whole Foods effect\".\n\nThe \"Whole Foods Effect\", among other amenities being added to neighborhoods in growing communities across the U.S., is one sign pointing toward the larger problem of gentrification. Gentrification is a process of renovation and revival of deteriorated urban neighborhoods. With this process often comes LULU's such as Whole Foods, luxury housing, etc.\n\nSan Francisco, like many other large cities in the United States, has a high cost of living. Its proximity to the Silicon Valley lends itself well to attracting high-income home buyers. As of 2013, 53% of low-income households throughout the entirety of the bay area were undergoing gentrification pressures caused by transit investment and new developments.\nBoston has been known historically for the high-cost of living that accompanies residence there, as well as being subject to various Urban renewal projects during America's Urban Renewal era. These renewal projects often caused the displacement of Jewish and Italian immigrants as well as working class individuals in surrounding areas in its earliest years.\n\nSuperfund, or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, was created to mitigate the cleanup and costs thereafter of hazardous waste sites. Superfund sites are often thought of when discussing LULUs. Love Canal was the first superfund site, established because of chemical waste that was being dumped into the canal by Hooker Electrical Company, later known as Hooker Chemical Company. The incident attracted widespread media attention and the neighborhoods surrounding Love Canal have since been destroyed. It has been suggested that some of these sites tend to be located in areas that have a high number of low-income, minority residents.\n\nOf the 1,000+ Superfund sites in America, 25% of them (both capped and active) are situated directly on or near Native American reservations. Many of these sites can interfere with various rituals and affect cultural objects, and create further conflict between the Government and affected tribes. As discussed in a report from the All Indian Pueblo's Office of Environmental Protection, \"the Superfund HRS [Hazard Ranking System] model does not account for Indian religious and ceremonial impacts from sites. Due to their importance in Pueblo life, culturally significant plants, animals, ceremonial surface water use, and sacred areas should be considered as critical impacts when evaluating the various pathways of exposure of the HRS.”\n\nThe environmental justice movement began after the discovery of illegal dumping throughout 14 North Carolina counties. 31,000 gallons of Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) was dumped by the Ward Transformers Company throughout these counties. The state government in North Carolina devised a landfill diversion plan for this waste after discovering the dumping, but the landfill was sited in Warren County, which had the greatest concentration of African American residents of all North Carolina's 100 counties, and was also the most poor, ranking 97th in GDP of the counties in North Carolina. The mainstream environmental movement was made popular by the emphasis on wildlife protection and wilderness preservation during the 20th century, but this presented cost barriers to poorer individuals whose concerns were not with wildlife and wilderness preservation. By virtue of the fact that this movement was not championed by poor people in its formative stages, it has caused these individuals to view the mainstream environmental movement as \"elitist.\" This elitism is understood through three different forms, according to a study by Denton E. Morrison and Riley E. Dunlap:\nEnvironmental justice movement emerged as a critique of mainstream environmentalism's elitism and racism. One of the greatest barriers to entry for poor individuals to join in the environmental justice movement is legal fees. In order to try and prevent the kinds of pollution like that of Warren County, NC, there are a great number of legal fees involved which are often costly. To that end, many of the companies that produce pollution will encourage acceptance of this pollution by communities in order to avoid clean up costs and costs associated with making certain industries more environmentally sustainable. That is, the cost of paying communities to accept pollution is often less than the (initial) cost/s of avoiding pollution all together. Therefore, it can be ascertained that poorer communities are likely to accept compensation for a certain level of pollution, and wealthier communities are willing to accept a smaller amount of pollution and demand a greater level of environmental quality. The difference is that one group is able to pay for environmental quality, and the other group is not.\n\n"}

{"id": "2032562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032562", "title": "Battle of Bronkhorstspruit", "text": "Battle of Bronkhorstspruit\n\nThe Battle of Bronkhorstspruit was the first major engagement of the First Boer War. It took place by the Bronkhorst Spruit (river), a few miles east of the town of Bronkhorstspruit, Transvaal on 20 December 1880.\n\nOn 12 April 1879 the Boer Transvaal Republic was formally annexed by the British Government. The decision was taken on the grounds of the bankruptcy of the Transvaal, and was believed to be supported by at least some of the burghers making up its male electorate. In fact the majority of the Transvaal's suffrage holders were opposed to the annexation as indicated by a petition of 6,000 out of a total number of 8,000 burghers. Only the mostly British commercial community of Pretoria were wholeheartedly in favor of this measure.\n\nBy the end of 1879 the elimination of the Zulu and Bapedi threats had removed any tolerance that the majority of the Boer population may have had for the protective presence of British troops and administrators in the Transvaal. Demonstrations were held against what was seen as an unjustifiable and unnecessary occupation. By March 1880 the election of a new Liberal Government in London, known to oppose the annexation and the reduction of the British garrison to two infantry battalions, had quietened unrest in the Transvaal. However Prime Minister Gladstone, concerned with Irish and other issues, had informed the Boer leader Paul Kruger that \"the Queen cannot be advised to relinquish her sovereignty over the Transvaal\". On 13 December 1880 4,000 Boer burghers met near Pretoria under Kruger and Piet Joubert to preclaim the restoration of the Republic.\n\nThe small British military detachment and government office at Pretoria was now surrounded by armed Boers, as were the other scattered garrisons in the Transvaal. The bulk of the 94th Foot were ordered from Lydenburg to secure Pretoria and the British Transvaal Administrator Colonel O. Lanyon there.\n\nA column of British soldiers comprising six officers and 246 men of the 94th Regiment, as well as 12 men of the Army Service Corps and four of the Army Hospital Corps, were marching on the road from Lydenburg to Pretoria, when at least 250 Boers appeared to the left of the column. Making use of the limited cover, the Boers crept to within 200 yards of the British, who were conspicuous in scarlet tunics and white helmets.\n\nLt.-Col. Philip Robert Anstruther had been ordered to take his troops to Pretoria because of unrest among the Boers, but had not had word of any declaration of war or of independence. An Irish regiment, the 94th Foot had seen recent active service against the Zulus at the Battle of Ulundi and the Bapedi leader Sekukini. The rear of the column was brought up by wagons and carts carrying the families and baggage of the troops.\n\nA Boer messenger, Burgher de Beer, who spoke English well, approached the head of the column under a flag of truce and bearing a letter, and informed Lt.-Col. Anstruther that his men would shoot within a few minutes. This instruction came from the triumvirate who had declared the independence of the South African Republic from British administration. Anstruther refused to withdraw, ordering ammunition from accompanying ox carts to be distributed to a column which had been marching in unprepared order and was headed by the regimental band. The Boers opened fire, reportedly at 12:30pm, before he could move his column into skirmish formation. De Beer had given Anstruther six minutes, but some of the Boers began firing before that time expired.\n\nWithin 15 minutes all of the officers were killed or wounded, and the horses and oxen pulling the covered wagons at the front and rear of the column were killed, preventing any movement. Shocked by the sudden and aggressive nature of the attack, the mortally wounded Lt.-Col. Anstruther gave the order to surrender. In an action lasting just 15 minutes, 156 British soldiers were killed or wounded, with the rest taken prisoner. Reported Boer casualties were only two killed and five wounded.\n\nAsh remarks that the alleged misuse of the white flag was something that would characterise the Boer approach to the conduct of war during the Second Anglo-Boer War, summing it up as a “the enemy must abide by the rules but we don’t have to” attitude. He also states that loyalists in the Transvaal called it the Massacre of Bronkhorst Spruit.\n\nOne of the officers present, a Captain Elliot, was captured but was later one of two officers permitted to leave the Transvaal by crossing the Vaal River at night. Ash writes that after releasing him, his Boer escorts decided to fire off a volley which resulted in Captain Elliot's death in mid-stream.\n\nWhile only a relatively small scale encounter the Battle of Bronkhorstspruit, with its defeat of an experienced force, had a serious impact on British military prestige. It was followed by British setbacks at Laing's Nek (28 January 1881) and Ingogo (8 February 1881); and finally the major defeat at the Battle of Majuba on 27 February 1881. On 6 March a truce was agreed with the Transvaal, bringing the First Boer War to an end. Although the Transvaal accepted Royal suzerainty (subsequently revoked) the Republic achieved its effective independence.\n\n"}

He was instrumental in the emergence of hyphy, a cultural movement in the Bay Area hip hop scene that emerged in the early 2000s. Hicks is considered one of the movement's key pioneers that fueled its popularity into mainstream, releasing songs with fast-paced rhymes and basslines that inspired a new style of dance. As the founder of the independent record label Thizz Entertainment, Hicks recorded dozens of albums and gave aspiring rappers an outlet to release albums locally.\n\nIn 2004, Hicks was killed by an unknown assailant after a performance in Kansas City, Missouri, a case that remains unsolved.\n\nAndre Louis Hicks was born in Oakland, California on July 5, 1970 and moved to Vallejo area. He would frequent specifically, Country Club Crest neighborhood, known locally as The Crest. In 1989, the outgoing Hicks made waves with a cassette tape featuring the single, \"\"Too Hard for the F---in' Radio\"\" while still a student at Vallejo's Hogan High School. NPR reflected on his sound in 2013 article as being \"\"fast and confident\"\" further writing that \"\"he built upon the bouncy bass that had its roots in the funk era.\"\" When asked about his childhood, Hicks stated that \"Situations came out for the better most of them, I went through the little trials and the shit that I went through.\" Hicks first adopted the stage name MC Dre in 1984, but altered it to Mac Dre the following year because he considered the name sounded \"too East Coast-ish\". Hicks recorded his first three EPs as Mac Dre between 1988 and 1992.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the city of Vallejo experienced a surge in bank robberies. Vallejo police began to focus on the Crest Neighborhood as the source with new found intensity. Hicks was vocal about the actions he saw being taken by the police and incorporated their aggressive surveillance of residents into his music. As gangster rap music consistently grew in popularity, law enforcement officials began to examine the lyrics of local rappers to utilize as evidence in criminal matters.\n\nOn March 26, 1992, at age 21, Hicks was invited by some of his friends to a road trip roughly 3 hours away to Fresno. Hicks had performed in the city two weeks prior and decided to go on the trip so that he could re-visit with a girl. While driving back to Vallejo the car was surrounded by the FBI along with Fresno and Vallejo police. The police stated that while Hicks was at a motel, his friends were allegedly casing a bank but had changed their mind when they saw a local Fresno TV News van in the bank's parking lot.\nWhen questioned by the police, Hicks stated that he did not leave the hotel therefore did not know anything. The police subsequently charged him with conspiracy to commit robbery, although no bank robbery was conducted and Hicks was neither with his friends nor near the location of the purported bank.\nHe was sentenced to five years in federal prison after he refused a deal which included implicating his friends in a robbery that did not occur. The trial was later listed among Complex Magazine's 30 Biggest Criminal Trials in Rap History. At the time of his conviction, Hicks owned the record label Romp Productions. Hicks was released a year early from prison for good behavior on August 2, 1996, after serving four years. It was during his time in prison, that Hicks developed a \"better appreciation for freedom, life, fun.\"\n\nAfter his release, Hicks wanted to start doing music that was easy to dance to. He and long time friend and fellow rapper, Troy Reddick a/k/a Da'unda'Dogg decided to try to do something different. The duo recorded several songs to pitch for the first time, to major record labels. One song was sent to various West-Coast-based representatives of the well-known Oakland rapper Too Short for an upcoming compilation, , but was not selected and it is unknown if the song ever made it to Too Short. In 2019, Grammy winning Atlanta rapper and multi-platinum producer, Lil Jon, with the blessing of Hicks's mother (Hicks was murdered in 2004), would incorporate the same vocals in the single \"\"Ain't No Tellin\"\" and release thru Geffen Records. Ironically, Lil Jon's 1998 debut to the Bay Area was through a song on the same Too Short compilation. Reddick, in a statement to Complex Magazine stated \"Of all the vocals Jon got, he picked some from the record Dre wrote to be released by a major label, and 23 years later Lil Jon has completed his goal!\" \n\nHicks continued to release multiple albums independently until his untimely death in 2004 that were wildly popular. In 1998, Hicks relocated to Sacramento to distance himself from the stigma that developed in the eyes of Vallejo law enforcement and founded the a new label, Thizz Entertainment label (now managed by his mother). In 2000, Hicks's change in sound became influential in the Hyphy Movement.\n\nAfter Hicks and other Thizz Entertainment members had performed a show in Kansas City, Missouri on October 31, 2004, an unidentified gunman shot at the group's van as it traveled on U.S. Route 71 in the early morning hours of November 1. The van's driver crashed and called 9-1-1, but Hicks was pronounced dead at the scene from a bullet wound to the neck.\n\nHe was buried at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.\n\n\n\nWest Coast Badboys - Master P - Certified Gold\n\n"}

Before and during the Cold War, it conducted over one thousand nuclear tests and tested many long-range nuclear weapons delivery systems.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1996, the U.S. government spent at least $ in present-day terms on nuclear weapons, including platforms development (aircraft, rockets and facilities), command and control, maintenance, waste management and administrative costs. It is estimated that, since 1945, the United States produced more than 70,000 nuclear warheads, which is more than all other nuclear weapon states combined. The Soviet Union/Russia has produced approximately 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949, France built 1,110 warheads since 1960, the United Kingdom built 835 warheads since 1952, China built about 600 warheads since 1964, and other nuclear powers built fewer than 500 warheads all together since they developed their first nuclear weapons. Until November 1962, the vast majority of U.S. nuclear tests were above ground. After the acceptance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.\n\nBy 1998 at least $759 million had been paid to the Marshall Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing. By February 2006 over $1.2 billion in compensation had been paid to U.S. citizens exposed to nuclear hazards as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia possess comparable numbers of nuclear warheads; together, these two nations possess more than 90% of the world's nuclear warheads. As of 2019, the U.S. has an inventory of 6,185 nuclear warheads; of these, 2,385 are retired and awaiting dismantlement and 3,800 are part of the U.S. stockpile. Of the stockpiled warheads, the U.S. stated in its March 2019 New START declaration that 1,365 are deployed on 656 ICBMs, SLBMs, and strategic bombers.\n\nThe United States first began developing nuclear weapons during World War II under the order of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939, motivated by the fear that they were engaged in a race with Nazi Germany to develop such a weapon. After a slow start under the direction of the National Bureau of Standards, at the urging of British scientists and American administrators, the program was put under the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and in 1942 it was officially transferred under the auspices of the United States Army and became known as the Manhattan Project, an American, British and Canadian joint venture. Under the direction of General Leslie Groves, over thirty different sites were constructed for the research, production, and testing of components related to bomb-making. These included the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, under the direction of physicist Robert Oppenheimer, the Hanford plutonium production facility in Washington, and the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee.\n\nBy investing heavily in breeding plutonium in early nuclear reactors and in the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion enrichment processes for the production of uranium-235, the United States was able to develop three usable weapons by mid-1945. The Trinity test was a plutonium implosion-design weapon tested on 16 July 1945, with around a 20 kiloton yield.\n\nFaced with a planned invasion of the Japanese home islands scheduled to begin on 1 November 1945 and with Japan not surrendering, President Harry S. Truman ordered the atomic raids on Japan. On 6 August 1945, the U.S. detonated a uranium-gun design bomb, Little Boy, over the Japanese city of Hiroshima with an energy of about 15 kilotons of TNT, killing approximately 70,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers, and destroying nearly 50,000 buildings (including the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division headquarters). Three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. attacked Nagasaki using a plutonium implosion-design bomb, Fat Man, with the explosion equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200–28,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants.\n\nOn 1 January 1947, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (known as the McMahon Act) took effect, and the Manhattan Project was officially turned over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nOn 15 August 1947, the Manhattan District was abolished.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1990, more than 70,000 total warheads were developed, in over 65 different varieties, ranging in yield from around .01 kilotons (such as the man-portable Davy Crockett shell) to the 25 megaton B41 bomb. Between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. spent at least $ in present-day terms on nuclear weapons development. Over half was spent on building delivery mechanisms for the weapon. $ in present-day terms was spent on nuclear waste management and environmental remediation.\n\nRichland, Washington was the first city established to support plutonium production at the nearby Hanford nuclear site, to power the American nuclear weapons arsenals. It produced plutonium for use in cold war atomic bombs.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the U.S. and USSR threatened with all-out nuclear attack in case of war, regardless of whether it was a conventional or a nuclear clash. U.S. nuclear doctrine called for mutually assured destruction (MAD), which entailed a massive nuclear attack against strategic targets and major populations centers of the Soviet Union and its allies. The term \"mutual assured destruction\" was coined in 1962 by American strategist Donald Brennan. MAD was implemented by deploying nuclear weapons simultaneously on three different types of weapons platforms.\n\nAfter the 1989 end of the Cold War and the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, the U.S. nuclear program was heavily curtailed, halting its program of nuclear testing, ceasing its production of new nuclear weapons, and reducing its stockpile by half by the mid-1990s under President Bill Clinton. Many former nuclear facilities were shut down, and their sites became targets of extensive environmental remediation. Efforts were redirected from weapons production to stockpile stewardship, attempting to predict the behavior of aging weapons without using full-scale nuclear testing. Increased funding was also put into anti-nuclear proliferation programs, such as helping the states of the former Soviet Union to eliminate their former nuclear sites and to assist Russia in their efforts to inventory and secure their inherited nuclear stockpile. By February 2006, over $1.2 billion had been paid under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 to U.S. citizens exposed to nuclear hazards as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons program, and by 1998 at least $759 million had been paid to the Marshall Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing, and over $15 million was paid to the Japanese government following the exposure of its citizens and food supply to nuclear fallout from the 1954 \"Bravo\" test. In 1998, the country spent an estimated total of $35.1 billion on its nuclear weapons and weapons-related programs.\n\nIn the 2013 book \"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters\" (Oxford), Kate Brown explores the health of affected citizens in the United States, and the \"slow-motion disasters\" that still threaten the environments where the plants are located. According to Brown, the plants at Hanford, over a period of four decades, released millions of curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment. Brown says that most of this radioactive contamination over the years at Hanford were part of normal operations, but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret, as the pollution continued unabated. Even today, as pollution threats to health and the environment persist, the government keeps knowledge about the associated risks from the public.\n\nDuring the presidency of George W. Bush, and especially after the 11 September terrorist attacks of 2001, rumors circulated in major news sources that the U.S. was considering designing new nuclear weapons (\"bunker-busting nukes\") and resuming nuclear testing for reasons of stockpile stewardship. Republicans argued that small nuclear weapons appear more likely to be used than large nuclear weapons, and thus small nuclear weapons pose a more credible threat that has more of a deterrent effect against hostile behavior. Democrats counterargued that allowing the weapons could trigger an arms race. In 2003, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to repeal the 1993 Spratt-Furse ban on the development of small nuclear weapons. This change was part of the 2004 fiscal year defense authorization. The Bush administration wanted the repeal so that they could develop weapons to address the threat from North Korea. \"Low-yield weapons\" (those with one-third the force of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945) were permitted to be developed.\n\nStatements by the U.S. government in 2004 indicated that they planned to decrease the arsenal to around 5,500 total warheads by 2012. Much of that reduction was already accomplished by January 2008.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon's June 2019 Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations, \"Integration of nuclear weapons employment with conventional and special operations forces is essential to the success of any mission or operation.\"\n\nBetween 16 July 1945 and 23 September 1992, the United States maintained a program of vigorous nuclear testing, with the exception of a moratorium between November 1958 and September 1961. By official count, a total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 100 of them taking place at sites in the Pacific Ocean, over 900 of them at the Nevada Test Site, and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States (Alaska, Colorado, Mississippi, and New Mexico). Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were atmospheric (that is, above-ground); after the acceptance of the Partial Test Ban Treaty all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.\n\nThe U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing exposed a number of the population to the hazards of fallout. Estimating exact numbers, and the exact consequences, of people exposed has been medically very difficult, with the exception of the high exposures of Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishers in the case of the Castle Bravo incident in 1954. A number of groups of U.S. citizens—especially farmers and inhabitants of cities downwind of the Nevada Test Site and U.S. military workers at various tests—have sued for compensation and recognition of their exposure, many successfully. The passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allowed for a systematic filing of compensation claims in relation to testing as well as those employed at nuclear weapons facilities. By June 2009 over $1.4 billion total has been given in compensation, with over $660 million going to \"downwinders\".\n\nA few notable U.S. nuclear tests include:\n\nA summary table of each of the American operational series may be found at United States' nuclear test series.\n\nThe original Little Boy and Fat Man weapons, developed by the United States during the Manhattan Project, were relatively large (Fat Man had a diameter of ) and heavy (around 5 tons each) and required specially modified bomber planes to be adapted for their bombing missions against Japan. Each modified bomber could only carry one such weapon and only within a limited range. After these initial weapons were developed, a considerable amount of money and research was conducted towards the goal of standardizing nuclear warheads so that they did not require highly specialized experts to assemble them before use, as in the case with the idiosyncratic wartime devices, and miniaturization of the warheads for use in more variable delivery systems.\n\nThrough the aid of brainpower acquired through Operation Paperclip at the tail end of the European theater of World War II, the United States was able to embark on an ambitious program in rocketry. One of the first products of this was the development of rockets capable of holding nuclear warheads. The MGR-1 Honest John was the first such weapon, developed in 1953 as a surface-to-surface missile with a maximum range. Because of their limited range, their potential use was heavily constrained (they could not, for example, threaten Moscow with an immediate strike).\n\nDevelopment of long-range bombers, such as the B-29 Superfortress during World War II, was continued during the Cold War period. In 1946, the Convair B-36 Peacemaker became the first purpose-built nuclear bomber; it served with the USAF until 1959. The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress was able by the mid-1950s to carry a wide arsenal of nuclear bombs, each with different capabilities and potential use situations. Starting in 1946, the U.S. based its initial deterrence force on the Strategic Air Command, which, by the late 1950s, maintained a number of nuclear-armed bombers in the sky at all times, prepared to receive orders to attack the USSR whenever needed. This system was, however, tremendously expensive, both in terms of natural and human resources, and raised the possibility of an accidental nuclear war.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, elaborate computerized early warning systems such as Defense Support Program were developed to detect incoming Soviet attacks and to coordinate response strategies. During this same period, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems were developed that could deliver a nuclear payload across vast distances, allowing the U.S. to house nuclear forces capable of hitting the Soviet Union in the American Midwest. Shorter-range weapons, including small tactical weapons, were fielded in Europe as well, including nuclear artillery and man-portable Special Atomic Demolition Munition. The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile systems allowed for hidden nuclear submarines to covertly launch missiles at distant targets as well, making it virtually impossible for the Soviet Union to successfully launch a first strike attack against the United States without receiving a deadly response.\n\nImprovements in warhead miniaturization in the 1970s and 1980s allowed for the development of MIRVs—missiles which could carry multiple warheads, each of which could be separately targeted. The question of whether these missiles should be based on constantly rotating train tracks (to avoid being easily targeted by opposing Soviet missiles) or based in heavily fortified silos (to possibly withstand a Soviet attack) was a major political controversy in the 1980s (eventually the silo deployment method was chosen). MIRVed systems enabled the U.S. to render Soviet missile defenses economically unfeasible, as each offensive missile would require between three and ten defensive missiles to counter.\n\nAdditional developments in weapons delivery included cruise missile systems, which allowed a plane to fire a long-distance, low-flying nuclear-tipped missile towards a target from a relatively comfortable distance.\n\nThe current delivery systems of the U.S. make virtually any part of the Earth's surface within the reach of its nuclear arsenal. Though its land-based missile systems have a maximum range of (less than worldwide), its submarine-based forces extend its reach from a coastline inland. Additionally, in-flight refueling of long-range bombers and the use of aircraft carriers extends the possible range virtually indefinitely.\n\nCommand and control procedures in case of nuclear war were given by the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) until 2003, when this was superseded by Operations Plan 8044.\n\nSince World War II, the President of the United States has had sole authority to launch U.S. nuclear weapons, whether as a first strike or nuclear retaliation. This arrangement was seen as necessary during the Cold War to present a credible nuclear deterrent; if an attack was detected, the United States would have only minutes to launch a counterstrike before its nuclear capability was severely damaged, or national leaders killed. If the President has been killed, command authority follows the presidential line of succession. Changes to this policy have been proposed, but currently the only way to countermand such an order before the strike was launched would be for the Vice President and the majority of the Cabinet to relieve the President under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nUnless the United States is actually under attack by a nuclear-capable adversary, the President can order nuclear strikes only in his capacity as a member of the two-man National Command Authority, the other member of which is the Secretary of Defense. Their joint decision must be transmitted to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who will then direct the National Military Command Center to issue an Emergency Action Message to nuclear-capable forces.\n\nThe President can give a nuclear launch order using his or her nuclear briefcase (nicknamed the nuclear football), or can use command centers such as the White House Situation Room. The command would be carried out by a Nuclear and Missile Operations Officer (a member of a missile combat crew, also called a \"missileer\") at a missile launch control center. A two-man rule applies to the launch of missiles, meaning that two officers must turn keys simultaneously (far enough apart that this cannot be done by one person).\n\nWhen President Reagan was shot in 1981 there was confusion about where the \"nuclear football\" was, and who was in charge.\n\nIn 1975 a launch crew member, Harold Hering, was dismissed from the Air Force for asking how he could know whether the order to launch his missiles came from a sane president. It has been claimed that the system is not foolproof.\n\nStarting with President Eisenhower, authority to launch a full-scale nuclear attack has been delegated to theater commanders and other specific commanders if they believe it is warranted by circumstances, and are out of communication with the president or the president had been incapacitated. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, on 24 October 1962, General Thomas Power, commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), took the country to DEFCON 2, the very precipice of full-scale nuclear war, launching the SAC bombers of the US with nuclear weapons ready to strike. Moreover, some of these commanders subdelegated to lower commanders the authority to launch nuclear weapons under similar circumstance. In fact, the nuclear weapons were not placed under locks until decades later, so pilots or individual submarine commanders had the power, but not the authority, to launch nuclear weapons entirely on their own.\n\nThe United States nuclear program since its inception has experienced accidents of varying forms, ranging from single-casualty research experiments (such as that of Louis Slotin during the Manhattan Project), to the nuclear fallout dispersion of the Castle Bravo shot in 1954, to accidents such as crashes of aircraft carrying nuclear weapons, the dropping of nuclear weapons from aircraft, losses of nuclear submarines, and explosions of nuclear-tipped missiles (broken arrows). How close any of these accidents came to being major nuclear disasters is a matter of technical and scholarly debate and interpretation.\n\nWeapons accidentally dropped by the United States include incidents near Atlantic City, New Jersey (1957), Savannah, Georgia (1958) (see Tybee Bomb), Goldsboro, North Carolina (1961) (see 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash), off the coast of Okinawa (1965), in the sea near Palomares, Spain (1966, see 1966 Palomares B-52 crash), and near Thule Air Base, Greenland (1968) (see 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash). In some of these cases (such as the 1966 Palomares case), the explosive system of the fission weapon discharged, but did not trigger a nuclear chain reaction (safety features prevent this from easily happening), but did disperse hazardous nuclear materials across wide areas, necessitating expensive cleanup endeavors. Eleven American nuclear warheads are thought to be lost and unrecovered, primarily in submarine accidents. The 1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion in Damascus, Arkansas, threw a warhead 30 meters from its silo but did not release any radiation.\n\nThe nuclear testing program resulted in a number of cases of fallout dispersion onto populated areas. The most significant of these was the Castle Bravo test, which spread radioactive ash over an area of over , including a number of populated islands. The populations of the islands were evacuated but not before suffering radiation burns. They would later suffer long-term effects, such as birth defects and increased cancer risk. There are ongoing concerns around deterioration of the nuclear waste site on Runit Island and a potential radioactive spill. There were also instances during the nuclear testing program in which soldiers were exposed to overly high levels of radiation, which grew into a major scandal in the 1970s and 1980s, as many soldiers later suffered from what were claimed to be diseases caused by their exposures.\n\nMany of the former nuclear facilities produced significant environmental damages during their years of activity, and since the 1990s have been Superfund sites of cleanup and environmental remediation. Hanford is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States and is the focus of the nation's largest environmental cleanup. Radioactive materials are known to be leaking from Hanford into the environment. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allows for U.S. citizens exposed to radiation or other health risks through the U.S. nuclear program to file for compensation and damages.\n\nIn 1972 three hijackers took control of a domestic passenger flight along the east coast of the U.S. and threatened to crash the plane into a U.S. nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plane got as close as 8,000 feet above the site before the hijackers' demands were met.\n\nVarious acts of civil disobedience since 1980 by the peace group Plowshares have shown how nuclear weapons facilities can be penetrated, and the group's actions represent extraordinary breaches of security at nuclear weapons plants in the United States. The National Nuclear Security Administration has acknowledged the seriousness of the 2012 Plowshares action. Non-proliferation policy experts have questioned \"the use of private contractors to provide security at facilities that manufacture and store the government's most dangerous military material\". Nuclear weapons materials on the black market are a global concern, and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small, crude nuclear weapon by a militant group in a major city, with significant loss of life and property.\n\nStuxnet is a computer worm discovered in June 2010 that is believed to have been created by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nThe initial U.S. nuclear program was run by the National Bureau of Standards starting in 1939 under the edict of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Its primary purpose was to delegate research and dispense funds. In 1940 the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) was established, coordinating work under the Committee on Uranium among its other wartime efforts. In June 1941, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) was established, with the NDRC as one of its subordinate agencies, which enlarged and renamed the Uranium Committee as the Section on Uranium. In 1941, NDRC research was placed under direct control of Vannevar Bush as the OSRD S-1 Section, which attempted to increase the pace of weapons research. In June 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took over the project to develop atomic weapons, while the OSRD retained responsibility for scientific research.\n\nThis was the beginning of the Manhattan Project, run as the Manhattan Engineering District (MED), an agency under military control that was in charge of developing the first atomic weapons. After World War II, the MED maintained control over the U.S. arsenal and production facilities and coordinated the Operation Crossroads tests. In 1946 after a long and protracted debate, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 was passed, creating the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as a civilian agency that would be in charge of the production of nuclear weapons and research facilities, funded through Congress, with oversight provided by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The AEC was given vast powers of control over secrecy, research, and money, and could seize lands with suspected uranium deposits. Along with its duties towards the production and regulation of nuclear weapons, it was also in charge of stimulating development and regulating civilian nuclear power. The full transference of activities was finalized in January 1947.\n\nIn 1975, following the \"energy crisis\" of the early 1970s and public and congressional discontent with the AEC (in part because of the impossibility to be both a producer and a regulator), it was disassembled into component parts as the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), which assumed most of the AEC's former production, coordination, and research roles, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which assumed its civilian regulation activities.\n\nERDA was short-lived, however, and in 1977 the U.S. nuclear weapons activities were reorganized under the Department of Energy, which maintains such responsibilities through the semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security Administration. Some functions were taken over or shared by the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The already-built weapons themselves are in the control of the Strategic Command, which is part of the Department of Defense.\n\nIn general, these agencies served to coordinate research and build sites. They generally operated their sites through contractors, however, both private and public (for example, Union Carbide, a private company, ran Oak Ridge National Laboratory for many decades; the University of California, a public educational institution, has run the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore laboratories since their inception, and will jointly manage Los Alamos with the private company Bechtel as of its next contract). Funding was received both through these agencies directly, but also from additional outside agencies, such as the Department of Defense. Each branch of the military also maintained its own nuclear-related research agencies (generally related to delivery systems).\n\nThis table is not comprehensive, as numerous facilities throughout the United States have contributed to its nuclear weapons program. It includes the major sites related to the U.S. weapons program (past and present), their basic site functions, and their current status of activity. Not listed are the many bases and facilities at which nuclear weapons have been deployed. In addition to deploying weapons on its own soil, during the Cold War, the United States also stationed nuclear weapons in 27 foreign countries and territories, including Okinawa (which was US-controlled until 1971,) Japan (during the occupation immediately following World War II), Greenland, Germany, Taiwan, and French Morocco then independent Morocco.\n\nEarly on in the development of its nuclear weapons, the United States relied in part on information-sharing with both the United Kingdom and Canada, as codified in the Quebec Agreement of 1943. These three parties agreed not to share nuclear weapons information with other countries without the consent of the others, an early attempt at nonproliferation. After the development of the first nuclear weapons during World War II, though, there was much debate within the political circles and public sphere of the United States about whether or not the country should attempt to maintain a monopoly on nuclear technology, or whether it should undertake a program of information sharing with other nations (especially its former ally and likely competitor, the Soviet Union), or submit control of its weapons to some sort of international organization (such as the United Nations) who would use them to attempt to maintain world peace. Though fear of a nuclear arms race spurred many politicians and scientists to advocate some degree of international control or sharing of nuclear weapons and information, many politicians and members of the military believed that it was better in the short term to maintain high standards of nuclear secrecy and to forestall a Soviet bomb as long as possible (and they did not believe the USSR would actually submit to international controls in good faith).\n\nSince this path was chosen, the United States was, in its early days, essentially an advocate for the prevention of nuclear proliferation, though primarily for the reason of self-preservation. A few years after the USSR detonated its first weapon in 1949, though, the U.S. under President Dwight D. Eisenhower sought to encourage a program of sharing nuclear information related to civilian nuclear power and nuclear physics in general. The Atoms for Peace program, begun in 1953, was also in part political: the U.S. was better poised to commit various scarce resources, such as enriched uranium, towards this peaceful effort, and to request a similar contribution from the Soviet Union, who had far fewer resources along these lines; thus the program had a strategic justification as well, as was later revealed by internal memos. This overall goal of promoting civilian use of nuclear energy in other countries, while also preventing weapons dissemination, has been labeled by many critics as contradictory and having led to lax standards for a number of decades which allowed a number of other nations, such as China and India, to profit from dual-use technology (purchased from nations other than the U.S.).\n\nThe Cooperative Threat Reduction program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was established after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 to aid former Soviet bloc countries in the inventory and destruction of their sites for developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and their methods of delivering them (ICBM silos, long-range bombers, etc.). Over $4.4 billion has been spent on this endeavor to prevent purposeful or accidental proliferation of weapons from the former Soviet arsenal.\n\nAfter India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998, President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on the countries. In 1999, however, the sanctions against India were lifted; those against Pakistan were kept in place as a result of the military government that had taken over. Shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001, President George W. Bush lifted the sanctions against Pakistan as well, in order to get the Pakistani government's help as a conduit for US and NATO forces for operations in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. government has officially taken a silent policy towards the nuclear weapons ambitions of the state of Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of Iran and North Korea. Until 2005 when the program was cancelled, it was violating its own non-proliferation treaties in the pursuit of so-called nuclear bunker busters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done, in part, on indications that Weapons of mass destruction were being stockpiled (later, stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells were located in Iraq), and the Bush administration said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government's agreement to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThe United States is one of the five nuclear weapons states with a declared nuclear arsenal under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), of which it was an original drafter and signatory on 1 July 1968 (ratified 5 March 1970). All signatories of the NPT agreed to refrain from aiding in nuclear weapons proliferation to other states.\n\nFurther under Article VI of the NPT, all signatories, including the US, agreed to negotiate in good faith to stop the nuclear arms race and to negotiate for complete elimination of nuclear weapons. \"Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.\" The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the preeminent judicial tribunal of international law, in its advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued 8 July 1996, unanimously interprets the text of Article VI as implying that:\n\nThere exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control. \n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2005 proposed a comprehensive ban on fissile material that would greatly limit the production of weapons of mass destruction. One hundred forty seven countries voted for this proposal but the United States voted against. The US government has also resisted the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, supported by more than 120 nations.\n\nIn 1958, the United States Air Force had considered a plan to drop nuclear bombs on China during a confrontation over Taiwan but it was overruled, previously secret documents showed after they were declassified due to the Freedom of Information Act in April 2008. The plan included an initial plan to drop 10–15 kiloton bombs on airfields in Amoy (now called Xiamen) in the event of a Chinese blockade against Taiwan's Offshore Islands.\n\nThe Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP) began on 31 July 2001. The program provides compensation and health benefits to Department of Energy nuclear weapons workers (employees, former employees, contractors and subcontractors) as well as compensation to certain survivors if the worker is already deceased. By 14 August 2010, the program had already identified 45,799 civilians who lost their health (including 18,942 who developed cancer) due to exposure to radiation and toxic substances while producing nuclear weapons for the United States.\n\nThe United States is one of the five recognized nuclear powers by the signatories of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). As of 2017, the US has an estimated 4,018 nuclear weapons in either deployment or storage. This figure compares to a peak of 31,225 total warheads in 1967 and 22,217 in 1989, and does not include \"several thousand\" warheads that have been retired and scheduled for dismantlement. The Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, is the only location in the United States where weapons from the aging nuclear arsenal can be refurbished or dismantled.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, the administration of President Barack Obama declared policies that would invalidate the Bush-era policy for use of nuclear weapons and its motions to develop new ones. First, in a prominent 2009 speech, U.S. President Barack Obama outlined a goal of \"a world without nuclear weapons\". To that goal, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a new START treaty on 8 April 2010, to reduce the number of active nuclear weapons from 2,200 to 1,550. That same week Obama also revised U.S. policy on the use of nuclear weapons in a Nuclear Posture Review required of all presidents, declaring for the first time that the U.S. would not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear, NPT-compliant states. The policy also renounces development of any new nuclear weapons.\n\nAs of 2019, the Trump administration has outlined plans to modernize all legs of the nuclear triad.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the revival of the nuclear arms race triggered large protests about nuclear weapons. On 12 June 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history. International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on 20 June 1983 at 50 sites across the United States. There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThere have also been protests by anti-nuclear groups at the Y-12 Nuclear Weapons Plant, the Idaho National Laboratory, Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository proposal, the Hanford Site, the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nOn 1 May 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades. In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched from downtown New York to the United Nations headquarters, calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nSome scientists and engineers have opposed nuclear weapons, including Paul M. Doty, Hermann Joseph Muller, Linus Pauling, Eugene Rabinowitch, M.V. Ramana and Frank N. von Hippel. In recent years, many elder statesmen have also advocated nuclear disarmament. Sam Nunn, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz—have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in various op-ed columns have proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Organizations such as Global Zero, an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.\n\nNew START Treaty Aggregate Numbers of Strategic Offensive Arms, 1 March 2019\n\nNotes:\n\n\nSources\n\n\n"}

In 1814, she married Reverend John Penrose, a country clergyman in Lincolnshire and a voluminous theological writer. \nDuring her girlhood, Mrs Penrose had frequently stayed with close relatives and guardians, the Misses Cartwright, at Mirfield Hall, Markham, a village in Nottinghamshire. She met her husband in the village, and used its name as the \"nom de plume\" of \"Mrs Markham\", under which she gained celebrity as a writer of history and other books for the young.\n\nThe best known of her books was \"A History of England from the First Invasion by the Romans to the End of the Reign of George III\" (1823), which went through numerous editions. \nIn 1828, she published a \"History of France\". \nBoth these works enjoyed a wide popularity in America as well as in England. \nThe distinctive characteristic of Mrs Markham's histories was the elimination of all the \"horrors\" of history, and of the complications of party politics, as being unsuitable for the youthful mind; and the addition to each chapter of \"Conversations\" between a fictitious group consisting of teacher and pupils bearing upon the subject matter.\n\nHer less well-known works were \"Amusements of Westernheath, or Moral Stories for Children\" (2 volumes, 1824); \"A Visit to the Zoological Gardens\" (1829); two volumes of stories entitled \"The New Children's Friend\" (1832); \"Historical Conversations for Young People\" (1836); \"Sermons for Children\" (1837).\n\nMrs Markham had three sons, including the architect Francis Crammer Penrose (father of Emily Penrose), and died at Lincoln on 24 January 1837 and was buried in Lincoln Minster.\nThere is a stained glass window to her memory in East Markham Church.\n\n"}

Other chronologies place his reign in 753–756, but cannot be reconciled with the testimony of the \"Namelist\" (or would require us to assume a long period of co-regency).\n\nThe \"Namelist\" stresses the fact that the accession of Kormisosh represents a change of dynasty, but it remains unclear whether that was done through violence. The reign of Kormisosh inaugurated a prolonged period of war with the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine V Kopronymos had begun to fortify the frontier and started settling Armenians and Syrians in Byzantine Thrace. In response Kormisosh demanded the payment of tribute, perhaps constituting an increase in the traditional payments. Rebuffed, Kormisosh raided into Thrace, reaching the Anastasian Wall stretching between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara 40 km in front of Constantinople. Constantine V marched out with his army, defeated the Bulgarians and turned them to flight. Conflict was resolved with a peace treaty between Kormisosh and Constantine V that probably confirmed the existing frontier.

{"id": "2032590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032590", "title": "Crop residue", "text": "Crop residue\n\nThere are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. In contrast, no-till, strip-till or reduced till agriculture practices are carried out to maximize crop residue cover. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Simple line transect measurements can be used to estimate residue coverage. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing.\n\nMost discussions about the economic value of crop residues focus on the equivalent fertilizer cost of the nutrients within. Although crop residues contain both macro- and micro nutrients, only values for the macro nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur are economically significant.\n\nBecause of the high carbohydrate content, crop residues can be considered as an appropriate feedstock to produce biofuels. Some algorithms have been developed to estimate the potential capacity of biofuel production from agricultural residues. Based on the experimental data obtained from a study that used ethanol organosolv pretreated rice straw to produce biohydrogen using \"Enterobacter aerogenes\", the annual global amount of collectable rice straw (not total produced straw) for biofuel production was estimated about 249 million tonnes, that could approximately produce 355.78 kilotonnes of hydrogen and 11.32 million tonnes of lignin by the proposed organosolv technology and it was found that China contributes to about 32% of global potential capacity to produce biohydrogen from rice straw.\n\nNutrients in most crop residue are not immediately available for crop use. Their release (called mineralization) occurs over a period of years. The biological processes involved in soil nutrient cycles are complex. As a rough guide, cereal straw releases about 10 to 15 per cent of its nutrients and pea residues release about 35 percent of their nutrients by the next year.\n\nThe speed of mineralization depends on the nitrogen and lignin (fiber) content, soil moisture, temperature, and degree of mixing with the soil. N is released fairly quickly from residue when the content is higher than 1.5 per cent (such as in pea residues). In contrast, below 1.2 per cent (such as cereal residue), soil-available N is fixed (called immobilization) by the microbes as they decompose the residue.\n\nThus pea residue would have short- and long-term benefits to soil fertility, whereas cereal straw would reduce next year's soil supply of available nutrients. Over time, the nutrients fixed by soil microbes and humus are released and available to crops.\nNutrients from residue are not fully recovered by crops. Just like fertilizer nutrients, nutrients released from crop residue into the soil are susceptible to losses such as leaching (N and S), denitrification (N), immobilization (N, P, K and S), and fixation (P and K).\n\nThe efficiency of nutrient uptake by crops from fertilizers or residue release is generally thought to be similar. For example, about 50 percent recovery of N in the above-ground plant in the first year. There is some residual benefit of fertilizers as the crops take up a small amount of the nutrients two and three years later. Fertilizer placement can significantly affect the efficiency of crop uptake. The impact of residue placement (buried by tillage or left on the surface in zero tillage) on nutrient cycling and efficiency is under study.\n\nThus, the practice of calculating the fertilizer equivalent value of the nutrients in crop residue is a reasonable guide to estimating the partial value of crop residues.\n\n\n\n"}

He was considered a powerful Deva of Deiva Loga. In Kali Yuga, He was born, and became known in history as Mudisoodum Perumal or Muthukutty.\n\nThe exact date of birth of Mudisoodum Perumal or Muthukutty is unknown. It is mostly placed in either 1810 or 1809, while others follow the view of Akilam.\n\nSampooranathevan of Deiva Loga and Paradevathai of Yama Loga had fallen in love. So, when Sampooranathevan asked Thirumal to be granted birth into the world, he requested the same be given to his lover. Paradevathai earlier had been married to a man of Yama Loga, but since had left him.\n\nThirumal refused, asserting that Para Devathai was already a wife, and that Sampooranathevan was from Deiva loga and she was from Yama Loga (a class difference). Thirumal stated that Sampooranathevan's physical birth would be great but hers would not, so Sampooranathevan's was wrong, encouraging Sampooranathevan to drop the matter. However Sampooranathevan replied, \"\"Your Highness, only at the most lovable place does the Ultimate love (love towards God) begin and not at a random place. [Implying that his love was of divine origin.] Isn't that true? So, please fulfill my desire. Also, I promise to you, I will be most affectionate to her.\"\" [bracket added by editors] So Thirumal allowed them to perform austrity, to take birth united and sublime.\n\nSampooranathevan and Para Devathai began performing austrity. When their tavam was close to an end, they saw Indra going that way. Until then their tapas had not met with any problem. But on seeing Indra a desire originated in the mind of Sampooranathevan. He asked Paradevathai, \"\" My dear, it will be fine if you and I, with the crown of Indra, rule the world.\"\" Paradevathai replied: \"\"Fine dear, but even if Brahma created us like that, may it be eternal.\"\" She was pointing out to him his libidinious enjoyment.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kailai, Sivan and Thirumal were discussing how to destroy Kali, after sending Lakshmi to grow as magaram in the sea, to give birth to a child for destroying Kali (She was also asked to perform austrity in the sea). Thirumal told him about Sampooranathevan and Paradevathai and about their tavam. He also said that it was time for the closure of their tavam and time to offer birth to them, and he suggested that they all go together to them. Thirumal and Sivan came to see the tavam. On seeing them Sampooranathevan and Paradevathai welcomed and praised them.\n\nAt the very first moment of seeing them, Sivan told Thirumal that their tavam met with failure, as they had desired the crown of Indra. On hearing this Thirumal asked Sampooranathevan to illustrate. But he wondered : \"\"I only speak of my thought with my lady with my eyes. We only communicate from mind to mind. Your greatness, How were you able to sense that.\"\" In saying this he fell on the feet of Sivan and Thirumal and asked them to excuse the misdeed. Paradevathai too cried for their rescue. They still implored Sivan and Thirumal to unite them.\n\nOn seeing this Thirumal told Paradevathai that since your austrity met with failure, and because of your previous husband's sufferings due to your separation, you will be born in the world in Yamakulam and will be married to your husband of Yama Lokam. You will suffer there. You will fall ill and live without any happiness. You will not have any bodily relations with him. But still you will do all your duties to him as per the karma. At that time Sampooranathevan will be born in the world in Devakulam and will lead a joyful life in the world. Due to your previous intimacy you two will meet each other and will fall in love with each other. You will not take care of God, your father, mother, or relations, and you will consider Sampooranathevan as your husband. You will suffer due to your defamation by others. Then you will seek supreme bliss and will realise (the Ultimate real truth) God and you will be granted moksha. By saying this she was born in the world.\n\nThirumal told Sampooranathevan that his request for Paradevathai's birth had been granted. Sampooranathevan praised them and also requested that they pardon his sin (desiring the crown of Indra). Mayon replied that, she, Paradevathai, fell in love with you even though her husband was alive. That is a sin. You performed tavam to purify her. It too failed. So you too must be born in the world and suffer like her. There, due to your deep love for her, your mind will tend to commit suicide without unifying with her. You and Paradevathai will live as husband and wife. At that time I will come and take you and transform you and give you birth as my son. And by you, I will wipe out my sorrows due to the sufferings of The Santror.\n\nSampooranathevan replied: \"Your greatness, I was asked to be born in the world which is full of evil and sorrows. I request that you create me in the primitive Santror race. I also request that you save not only me but also the santror makkal among whom I am going to be born. And he asked Thirumal to say when he would go into the world to rescue him. Thirumal replied that he would be created in the world in the Santror race in Devakulam, and he pointed out some events which would take place in the world at the time of his arrival. Then Sampooranathevan praised Sivan and Thirumal and was born.\"\n\nThe soul of Sampooranathevan was to be given birth in the world in a human body. The suitable body was sought and found. The child was given birth by Veiyelal, wife of Ponnu Nadar. This child grew and became known in history as Muthukutty.\n\nSampooranathevan also known as \"Muthukutty\" was born in 1809 to Ponnu Nadar and Veyilal Amma at Poovandanthope in the Kanyakumari District (part of Travancore then). They initially named the child Mudisoodum Perumal, meaning \"Lord with a crown\". But the people complained to authorities about the name and they forced the parents to change his name to \"Muthukutty\".\n\nThe boy was initially named Mudisoodum perumal, but due to the pressure from higher castes the name was changed to Muthukutty. He started his life as a palm climber. He met Paradevathi and lived like a husband with his wife. Paradevathi soon gave birth to a son, but it was claimed that her first husband was the father. Akilam does not say anything about any birth.\n\nMuthukutty was a religious boy who had special interest in Lord Vishnu. The holy book Akilathirattu mentions that he set a pedestal for Lord Vishnu in his house. At age of seventeen, Muthukutty started to live with Thirumalammal from the nearby village of Puviyur and she lived with him only to serve him during his public activities. Thirumalammal had been married, but left her former husband to marry Muthukutty. According to quotes found in \"Akilathirattu\", they had a male child, who was sired by her first husband. Muthukutty earned his living as a Palmyra palm climber and as an agricultural laborer.\n\nMuthukutty in his twenty-fourth year, he was struck by illness and suffered for a year. At this time, and in a dream of his mother Lord Narayana asked her to take her son to Thiruchendur temple. His mother took her sick son to the temple at Thiruchendur, during a festival there. He went into the sea and disappeared. The parents searched for his body for one day. According to the legend, the day itself inside the sea Muthukutty also known as Sampooranathevan was granted moksha by Lord Narayana.\n\n\n\n"}

The stories were written by Steve Moore (no relation) and most of them were illustrated by Art Adams.\n\nJonni Future was created in 2002 by writer Steve Moore and artist Arthur Adams, as a pastiche of a pulp science fiction series like Adam Strange and Barbarella. It was published in eight-page installments in the America's Best Comics anthology \"Tom Strong's Terrific Tales\", the first ten issues of which Adams penciled from 2002–2004. Adams' work on \"Jonni Future\" has been characterized as exhibiting a romantic influence, with greater amounts realism and fine hatching, which Adams refers to as \"noodling\". Adams says he was inspired by sources such as Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri, Warren Publishing's \"Vampirella\", and the character designs in Capcom video game character books when he drew \"Jonni Future\", and refrained from using straight edges or templates in order to achieve a more elegant, hand-drawn appearance. Adams drew the first three chapters of \"Jonni Future\" at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, \"The Garden of the Sklin\", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. He regards \"Jonni Future\" as his best work.\n\nDespite the well-endowed character's incredulity at the idea that her uncle intended her to wear the revealing costume that she wears in the series, Jonni nonetheless accepts her role as an adventurer, with much of the plots centering on or making mention of her attractive nature, or barely clothed damsels in distress in general. For example, in the second installment, \"Moth Women of the Myriad Moons\", Jonni battles a swarm of creatures with greatly exaggerated female characteristics like her own. In the third chapter, \"The Seraglio of the Stars\", Jonni is captured with the intent of making her a sex slave, but escapes with a plan in which she and the other slaves use their sexuality against their captors, one that includes Jonni being briefly nude.\nIn the fourth story,\"The Witch of the World's End\" a group of 16th century Christian witch-hunters are transported into the future, and encounter a city whose motifs indicate a liberated view of sexuality and nudity, causing them to conclude that they have reached the literal \"end of the world\", and that Jonni Future is a witch. \n\nJonni's uncle came and went at his pleasure from the 20th century to the Crepusculum, a time billions of years in the future when the whole solar system teeters on the brink of collapse and several planets have already disintegrated in a maelstrom of asteroids. He made these journeys via a portal located in his home. \n\nAfter his death, he leaves his home to his ethnobotanist niece, Jonni. She inherits the house, she learns, on the condition that she keep it, and resell it to no one. In her first night in the house (which is intended to resemble Norman Bates' house from the film \"Psycho\"), she finds her uncle's old magazines and starts reading about his fanciful exploits. Jonni encounters Jermaal Van Pavane, an anthropomorphic cheetah, who crossed from the pulp universe via a dimensional bridge in the attic. He brings her back to her uncle's old lair, explains to her the truth about him. Jermaal becomes her sidekick in the campy action, explaining that her uncle wished her to take up his mantle as a hero and protector of the Grand Array, the fantastic universe he lost his life defending. His legacy to Jonni includes trappings like the fish-shaped spaceship Coelacanth, a war suit and a \"universal translator\" helmet that enable Jonni to communicate with Jermaal and other aliens.\n\n\nTomorrow Stories 64-Page Specials\n"}

It is also the first album not to feature then-former bassist Ron Blair on any tracks.\n\nThe Heartbreakers' approach when starting to work on the album in 1986 was to make it sound like a live recording.

{"id": "2032621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032621", "title": "Generation Swine", "text": "Generation Swine\n\nGeneration Swine is the seventh studio album by the Glam Metal band Mötley Crüe, released on June 24, 1997. The album marks the return of lead singer Vince Neil following his last appearance on 1991's \"Dr. Feelgood\" and the last to feature drummer Tommy Lee until the 2008 album \"Saints of Los Angeles\". It is also the band's last album to be released on Elektra Records.\n\nThough he did not sing leads on the album, John Corabi (who replaced Neil in 1992 and sung lead vocals on their previous release) received a writing credit on the album, making this the last album he would write on, as he was dismissed from the band in 1996 when Neil returned.\n\nFollowing the commercial failure of the band's self-titled album, Mötley Crüe was under pressure by executives at Elektra Records to return Mötley Crüe to the level of commercial success that the band enjoyed in the 1980s.\n\nThe band, then officially consisting of vocalist/guitarist John Corabi, bassist Nikki Sixx, drummer Tommy Lee and guitarist Mick Mars, were so frustrated with the failure of the previous album and tour sales that they fired numerous people around the group, including their accountant, manager Doug Thaler, and their producer Bob Rock. The band then hired Allen Kovac as their new manager and started looking for another producer to work with for their next record which was originally titled \"Personality #9\".\n\nAfter the mass firing, the band was called to a meeting with Warner Bros. CEO Doug Morris to discuss the current state of the band. At the meeting, Morris tried to convince Sixx and Lee to get rid of Corabi, as he wasn't a \"star,\" and reunite with original singer Vince Neil. Sixx and Lee were not interested in the idea of working with Neil again, and insisted on keeping Corabi in the group. With some additional convincing from Elektra CEO Sylvia Rhone, Morris agreed and the band continued with their work.\n\nMötley returned to the studio intending to record a straight rock record that was more aggressive than the \"Mötley Crüe\" album. With Rock producing, they recorded material such as \"The Year I Lived In a Day\" and \"La Dolce Vita.\" The band was so excited that, according to Corabi, \"At the end of each day we'd walk around the studio carrying our huge cocks in our hands because the music rocked so hard.\"\n\nAfter Rock was fired for being \"too expensive and overproduc[ing] the music\", the band eventually chose Scott Humphrey, with Sixx and Lee serving as coproducers. But the process became disorganized, as Humphrey and Sixx regularly argued over ideas. Mars' role was greatly reduced due to an ongoing feud between him and Humphrey, and Corabi grew increasingly frustrated, as he would learn and write material only to find it completely changed by the time he returned to the studio.\n\nAs the recording continued, the band was being pressured to reunite with Neil. Corabi decided he had had enough of the frustration of working under the pressure that the band and Humphrey put on him. With Corabi out, the door was open for Neil to return.\n\nNeil had been busy with his solo career and the untimely death of his daughter Skylar, when Kovac had approached him with the idea of reuniting with Mötley that Morris had presented to Sixx and Lee earlier. Neil, like Sixx and Lee, was against the idea, but Kovac planted the idea of a reunion in Neil's head that eventually changed his mind. After meeting with Sixx and Lee, Neil agreed to rejoin and finish the album, whose title had been changed to \"Generation Swine\".\n\nMusically, the album shows Mötley trying to update their image and sound, experimenting with trends such as electronica and alternative rock. The songs draw heavy influence from Cheap Trick in the first half of the record. Rick Nielsen and Robin Zander did backing vocals in some songs. Most of the album was written while Corabi was with the band, and as such Neil had difficulty adjusting his voice to the material and sound. \"There's a lot on that album that I'd have changed had I been there from the start,\" he remarked. \"I didn't think the producer really knew what he was doing, because he wouldn't let me sing in the style I was accustomed to. He wouldn't let Mick play his usual way either. It was a nightmare.\"\n\nEven with Neil back in the band, the album proved a departure from traditional Mötley albums. Besides the aforementioned experimentation, the album featured Sixx and Lee on lead vocals for the first time: Sixx on \"Rocketship\" (a love song tofor his new romance with model Donna D'Errico) and parts of \"Find Myself\"; Lee on \"Brandon\" (a namesake song for his first-born son, and his then-current wife, model Pamela Anderson) and \"Beauty\".\n\nLyrically, \"Generation Swine\" ranges from songs about drugs and prostitution such as \"Find Myself\" and \"Beauty,\" to the anti-suicide stance on \"Flush\" and familial love on \"Rocketship\" and \"Brandon.\"\n\n\"Afraid\" was released as the first single from the album. The video featured \"Hustler\" publisher Larry Flynt, who also put the band on the cover of an issue of \"Hustler\" that year. \"Afraid\" reached #10 on the US mainstream rock charts, but that too did little to generate interest in the album. The second single released was \"Beauty\" which reached number 37 on the mainstream rock charts. \"Find Myself\" and \"Glitter\" were released as a promo singles and a music video was made for \"Shout at the Devil '97\". The band felt that the album's sluggish sales were due to Elektra not promoting the album properly, claiming that the label was only interested in promoting R & B acts. Rhone denied this claim though, stating that Mötley Crüe was a major priority for Elektra and that the label had spent a large sum of money in order to get the band to perform \"Shout at the Devil '97\" on the American Music Awards in January 1997.\n\nTo promote the album, Skeleteens Beverages in Pasadena, California created a soft drink for the band called, \"Motley Brue.\" The drink came in bottles which featured the new, \"Pig logo\" and consisted of large amounts of blue #1 which turned everything blue. The intentions were to have people that drank the soft drink urinate green fluid. Mötley Crüe helped design the bottles that featured lyrics from \"Generation Swine\" songs on the reverse of each label.\n\n\"Generation Swine\" debuted at No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling over 80,500 copies in its first week and was certified Gold by the RIAA on August 27, 1997. Despite the strong charting debut, the album failed to return the band to the level of critical and commercial success that had been hoped for with the reunion, and according to Nielsen SoundScan the album has sold about 306,000 copies in the U.S. to date. In 2008, singer Vince Neil stated that the album was \"terrible\" due to \"too much experimenting\".\n\n\"Generation Swine\" would be the group's final release on Elektra Records, as the label and Mötley Crüe would break their relationship off in early 1998. Future releases from the group would come from their own Mötley Records.\n\n\"Generation Swine\" received mixed reviews. \"Somehow,\" Sixx observed in 2000, \"the spin had got out there that Mötley was going to flirt with an alternative sound – that we'd sold out. Sure, it was experimental, but it wasn't alternative, techno or dance. So I was a little disappointed at the way it was received.\"\nSputnikmusic highlights the experimental nature of the production which \"is devoted to hard rock tracks structurally very similar to their so-called 'classic era' but sonically re-wired and approached from a direction entirely alien to the band\" and praises \"the vast improvement, or at the very least development, in Nikki Sixx's songwriting\", finally declaring \"Generation Swine\" \"a worthwhile experiment for the band that produced some of their most enduring music.\" David Grad of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praises Neil's voice, which lost \"none of its hormonal urgency\" and describes the music as a display \"of highly burnished metal trumpeting the pleasures of drugs and nasty sex.\" Martin Popoff calls it \"the summer record of '97.\"\n\nIn contrast, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls the album \"nothing short of an embarrassment\" and blames the band for \"simply recycling old ideas and sounds\", not coming up \"with any catchy riffs\" and making the return of Neil \"just a coincidence.\" Dean Golemis of the \"Chicago Tribune\" agrees, writing that despite \"nose-bleeding punk runs\", what transpires is the sound of a \"Hollywood metal band from the '80s.\" Jon Wiederhorn of \"Rolling Stone\" remarks how the band tried to fuse \"cornball glam-metal techniques\" with \"cutting-edge production and grinding industrial effects\", but – instead of a \"new direction that would defy expectations\" – produced an album \"more schizophrenic than Wesley Willis\", unwelcome to Mötley fans who \"crave consistency\". J. D. Considine, another \"Rolling Stone\" reviewer, finds the album \"as limp as overcooked spaghetti.\" Neil Arnold of \"Metal Forces\" calls \"Generation Swine\" \"the black sheep of the Crüe family, making even the 1994 self-titled opus look brilliant\" and ascribes its failure to the fusion of \"industrial-fueled grooves and clanking rhythms\" with the \"distinctive Vince Neil whine\", concluding that \"'electronica' and 'alternative' are not words [he]’d associate with Mötley Crüe.\"\n\nOn July 7, 1997, Corabi filed a $4-million lawsuit against the band for alleged breach of contract, fraud, and slander. Corabi's claim was that he had not received royalties or credit for his work and contributions while he was in the band.\n\nCorabi was only officially credited for two songs on the original pressing of \"Generation Swine\", \"Flush\" and \"Let Us Prey,\" but claimed that he was responsible for at least 80% of the material on the album.\n\n\n"}

As such, it served as the house of many renowned prelate, such as Antoine Duprat, Louis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Louis de Lorraine, Nicolas de Pellevé (who died in the \"hôtel\") or Jacques Davy Duperron. Margaret of Valois also lived there in 1605 and 1606, and her decision to cut a fig tree (\"figuier\") in front of the building is said to have inspired the name of the street, \"rue du Figuier\".\n\nIn 1622, Paris became an archdiocese. The archbishops of Sens lost the major part of their power in the city, and their sojourns in Paris became progressively less frequent. The \"hôtel,\" alienated during the 17th century to the archdiocese of Paris, entered a lasting period of progressive decay. A \"bien national\" during the French Revolution, it was sold in 1797 and privately owned throughout the 19th century, housing, like many \"hôtels particulier\" in the Marais at the time, shops, workshops or factories. During the \"Trois Glorieuses\" street fights of 1830, a cannonball hit the facade and lodged deep within the wall ; it is visible nowadays above the main entrance, the date engraved beneath.\n\nProtected as a heritage site in 1862, the building was acquired by the city of Paris, and thoroughly restored in 1930. The Forney art library was installed in it in 1961.\n"}

They were designed by William Stanier based on the earlier LMS Fowler 2-6-2T.\n\nA taper-boiler versions of Henry Fowler's 1930 design, the general dimensions were the same with some improvements. They were under-boilered and although improved they were always considered to be indifferent performers. In some ways they were inferior to their predecessors. The cab was of Stanier's usual excellent design with the coal bunker built higher than the rear cab windows but angled inwards to avoid them, thus giving good visibility when running bunker first.\n\nThe first 2 lots (117 and 126, locomotives 71–144) were built with number 6 domeless boilers but the rest were built with improved 6A boilers with separate top-feed and steam dome. Both types of boilers were later modified to carry Adams ‘Vortex’ blastpipe to improve steaming. These locomotives could always be identified by the larger diameter chimney. \nThe 139 locomotives were numbered 71–209 by the LMS, and after 1948 BR renumbered them 40071–209. The LMS classified them 3P.\n\nIn a final attempt to improve the locomotives 6 were rebuilt with larger 6B boilers; these were 169 in 1940, 163 in 1941, 148 and 203 in 1942, and 40142 and 40167 in 1956. The re-boilering was not considered to be cost effective.\n\nThey were to be found on various duties – stopping train, suburban passenger routes, branch line, empty stock and banking.\n\nThey are generally considered to be the least successful of Stanier's standard designs\n\nThe class was withdrawn between November 1959 and December 1962, with the last of the large boiler variant (40148) having been withdrawn in September 1962. None were preserved.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2032650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032650", "title": "Frank Sharp (land developer)", "text": "Frank Sharp (land developer)\n\nFrank Wesley Sharp (18 March 1906 – 2 April 1993) was a land developer in Houston, Texas, United States who was responsible for creating several large post-World War II housing developments.\n\nSharp's largest projects included \"Oak Forest\" in 1946 and \"Sharpstown\" in 1955. Sharp also created \"Royden Oaks\" in the early 1970s. Sharp later was a central figure in the Sharpstown scandal, and as a result he was convicted of violating federal banking and securities laws and was sentenced to three years' probation and a $5,000 fine.\n\nFrank W. Sharp, usually known as simply Frank Sharp, was born on March 18, 1906, on an East Texas farm the near the small town of Crockett in Houston County, Texas, where he lived until he finished a high school education. Determined to improve his lot in life, he left home at the age of 19 and headed to the booming city of Houston, where he then settled. He soon got a job as a carpenter's helper during the day, while he began attending a business college at night. These actions started him on the path to becoming a major real estate developer in Southeast Texas.\nDuring the 1930s, the Houston area was reasonably well insulated from the grim economic realities of the Great Depression by the completion of the Houston Ship Channel and the rise of the petroleum industry. Sharp reportedly borrowed $150 and began building one house at a time in subdivisions that were beginning to surround the city. Soon, he advanced to building multiple homes in subdivisions like Jacinto City and Texas City during World War II.\n\nToward the end of World War II, Sharp shrewdly guessed that Houston would continue growing to the northwest, beyond the Garden Oaks subdivision, which architect E. L. Crain had opened in 1937. In 1946, Sharp hired the architectural firm, Wilson, Morris and Crain, and bought of land adjacent to Garden Oaks, where he began constructing prefabricated and preassembled homes on 4780 lots by mid-1947. He named his new subdivision Oak Forest.\n\nIntending to remain involved in all phases of the development, Sharp reorganized his business empire to accomplish that goal. His Frank W. Sharp Enterprises, became an umbrella company that ran four smaller entities: (a) a firm doing concrete and street work; (b) the Douglas Fir Lumber Company, whose two mills in the Northwest prevented Sharp from suffering widespread shortages of lumber; (c) the Oak Forest Corporation to handle development and merchandising; and (d) the Frank W. Sharp Construction Company to handle the building. A separate, but closely connected, company took care of the millwork.\n\nIn July 1948, the popular and well-respected magazine \"Better Homes and Gardens\" (BH&G) featured several Oak Forest homes in an article, and said that the proposed investment of $32 million and projected population of 25,000 made Oak Forest,\"...one of the largest privately financed, single-family home developments in United States or world history.” By then, many potential customers had come to think of prefabricated, prebuilt, and planned housing developments as monotonous, and lacking individuality. Sharp adopted a marketing slogan of, “No two houses are alike.” The BH&G article noted that, \"... among the first 400 homes built in Oak Forest, only two were alike in planning and only two were white in color.”\n\nBy September 1948 rising costs for materials and overheads were cutting deeply into Sharp's profit margin. He responded by contracting out the actual construction. Sharp's organization could still offer cheaper prices for lumber and office support. In 1953, Sharp announced that he would open Peoples State Bank in Oak Forest. He also planned to open a shopping center on the border between Oak Park and Garden Oaks in May, 1953.\n\nOak Forest was essentially \"built out\" by 1955, but Frank Sharp already had a vision for an even greater development. He had already bought an expanse of land at the southwest edge of Houston and near the northeastern limit of Bellaire, Texas. Promotional literature at the time described it as \"... the biggest real-estate subdivision in the world: 25,000 homes, 100,000 people.” Frank named it \"Sharpstown.\"\n\nIn 1961, Sharp had added Sharpstown State Bank to his holdings, and in 1963, he bought National Bankers Life. By the early 1970s, Sharp had added banking and insurance to his empire. Wanting to assure passage of a bill that would help his banking enterprise (Sharpstown State Bank), he decided to offer unsecured bank loans to a number of key politicians. The politicians who were willingly ensnared in these dealings included then Governor of Texas, Preston Smith, Speaker of the House Gus Mutscher, Texas House Representatives W. S. Heatley and Tommy L. Shannon, Texas Democratic Party chairman, Dr. Elmer Baum. They, in turn agreed to use the loans to buy stock in Sharp's insurance company (National Bankers Life). About the same time, Sharpstown State Bank made unsecured loans to Sharp's son-in-law, W. D. Haden II, who was then trying to buy a controlling interest in Olympic Life Insurance Company of Fort Worth. Concerned by the number and size of the loans Sharpstown bank was making, the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) notified bank management that the FDIC might cancel its deposit insurance if it did not immediately cease making these dubious loans.\n\nThough a life-long Methodist, he became a such a generous donor to Strake Jesuit College Preparatory and became the only Protestant to be named as a \"founder\" within the benefactors of the Society of Jesus. He was so highly regarded by the Pope and other members of the Church hierarchy that he was honored in Rome. During the Sharpstown Scandal, Sharp advised Strake Jesuit to buy shares of National Bankers Life at $20–26 per share . The school lost $6,000,000 from his advice.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began uncovering evidence of wrongdoing in 1971, and soon began giving information to the press. On January 18, 1971, the SEC came before the federal court in Dallas to formally charge former Democratic state attorney general Waggoner Carr, former state insurance commissioner John Osorio, Frank Sharp, a number of other defendants, and Sharp's corporations, including the Sharpstown State Bank and National Bankers Life Insurance Corporation, with stock fraud in a scheme hatched by Sharp himself. The suit started a run on the bank by its depositors, which was quelled by the FDIC.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mutscher and his close associates, Heatley and Shannon, thereafter, frequently called the \"Abilene Three\" by the press, were charged in an Abilene court with accepting a bribe from Sharp. During the trial, District Attorney revealed that Governor Smith was an unindicted co-conspirator. On March 15, 1972, after only 120 minutes of deliberation by the jury, the trial ended with a guilty verdict for each of the three. The next day, Judge J. Neil Daniel sentenced them to five years' probation.\n\nSharp himself pleaded guilty to all charges. He was fined $5,000 and sentenced to three years' probation for violating Federal banking and securities laws.\n\n"}
{"id": "2032656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032656", "title": "Battle of Laing's Nek", "text": "Battle of Laing's Nek\n\nThe Battle of Laing's Nek was a major battle fought at Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on 28 January 1881.\n\nFollowing the Boer declaration of independence for the Transvaal in 1880 the British suffered a series of disastrous defeats in attempting to regain the territory.\n\nOn 20 December 1880, Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Robert Anstruther and elements of his regiment, the 94th, marched from Lydenburg to Pretoria, the regiment’s band leading the column playing the popular song \"Kiss Me, Mother Darling\".\n\nAt Bronkhorstspruit the force was stopped by Boers who courteously required the \"Red Soldiers\" to turn back. Anstruther equally courteously refused at which point the column was devastated by rifle fire from the surrounding Boer ambush. Of the 259 in the column, 155 officers and men became casualties as did some of the women accompanying the regiment.\n\nInstead of waiting for the reinforcements, the British High Commissioner for South East Africa, Major General Sir George Pomeroy Colley, assembled what troops he could and rushed forward, claiming to be moving to relieve the British garrisons in the Transvaal.\n\nColley gathered his force at Newcastle in Natal, dispatched an ultimatum to the Boers and, on its rejection, advanced towards the Transvaal border.\n\nThe first British camp on the march lay some 4 miles short of Laing’s Nek, a ridge in the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains that blocked the road between Newcastle and Standerton in Natal, South Africa.\n\nThe British Natal Field Force, commanded by General Colley, numbered around 1,216 officers and men, including 5 companies of the 58th Regiment, 5 companies of the 3rd Battalion, the 60th Rifles, about 150 cavalrymen of the Mounted Squadron, a party of Royal Navy sailors with two 7-pound guns, and finally a unit of men from the Royal Artillery with four 9-pound guns.\n\nThe Boers, under the command of Commandant-General Joubert had about 2,000 men in the area, with at least 400 fortifying the heights around Laing's Nek. They had little difficulty in repulsing General Colley's inadequate force.\n\nOn the morning of 28 January, Colley tried to force a way through the pass. The battle began at around about half past nine with a heavy bombardment with the four 9-pounder guns and two 7-pound guns of the British Naval Brigade pounding the Boer positions on Table Hill.\n\nTen minutes later, the main British force, made up of the 58th Regiment, went forward and had difficulty advancing over the broken ground towards the summit. Further down the line, the Mounted Squadron made a charge against the Boer positions on nearby Brownlow's Kop. But, on reaching the summit, the British cavalry were fired upon by a line of entrenched Boers on the reverse slope, suffering many casualties, forcing them to withdraw.\n\nBy 10:30, with their threat to their flank removed, the Boers moved to attack the 58th Regiment still advancing on Table Hill where at 11:00, at reaching the top of the summit, the British were fired upon by concealed Boers in trenches just away and suffered even more casualties, including both commanding officers, Major Hingeston and Colonel Deane being killed.\n\nWhile this was happening, a small party of Boers actually advanced from their positions on the lower slopes of nearby Majuba Hill and engaged the Naval Brigade near the British camp at Mount Prospect. Return rifle fire from the British kept the Boers back. By 11:10, two companies of the 3/60th Rifles had moved up Table Hill to cover the retreat of the 58th Regiment and by noon, the battle was over.\n\nThe British lost 84 killed, 113 wounded, and 2 captured during what was perceived as a fiasco. Most of the casualties were from the 58th Regiment, with 74 killed and 101 wounded, around 35% of their total strength. Among those killed in the battle were many of General Colley's staff including Major Poole and Lieutenants Dolphin, Elwes and Inman. The Boers reported their losses at 14 killed and 27 wounded. One month later, General Colley was killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill, which ended the war, after which Transvaal was recognised as an independent state.\n\nThe Victoria Cross is the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\n\n\n\n"}

The theatre Festival runs annually from early June through September in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Festival is produced by Bard on the Beach Theatre Society whose mission is to perform, explore and celebrate the works of William Shakespeare. In addition to the annual summer festival, the Society runs a number of year-round theatre education and outreach programs under the umbrella of Bard Education. Bard on the Beach celebrated its 30th anniversary season in 2019.\n\nBard on the Beach began as an Equity Co-op in the summer of 1990, funded primarily by an Explorations Grant awarded to Artistic Director Christopher Gaze by the Canada Council for the Arts. Following his graduation from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, Gaze had moved to Canada on the advice of his friend, mentor and theatre legend Douglas Campbell. After performing with a variety of theatre companies and festivals across Canada, including three seasons with the Shaw Festival, Gaze moved to Vancouver in 1983 where he performed as Richard III in the 1984 season of the now defunct Vancouver Shakespeare Festival.\n\nWhile in Vancouver, Gaze became acquainted with a group of actors and fellow Shakespeare lovers when he was asked to direct a production of \"Under Milk Wood\" for the 1989 Vancouver Fringe Festival. The following summer, this same group staged \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" in a rented theatre tent in Vanier Park as the inaugural Bard on the Beach production. The company's initial four-week run drew a total of 6,000 people and signaled the need for a more formal company structure. Bard on the Beach officially registered as a not-for-profit under the Society Act of BC in December, 1990.\n\nBard is located in Vanier Park at the south end of the Burrard Street Bridge. It consists of two performance stages: the BMO Mainstage and the Howard Family Stage. There is also a group of tents known as the Bard Village which contains the box office, Bard Boutique gift shop, and concession stands. The festival grounds also contain dressing rooms, administrative offices for seasonal staff and an event Marquee along with two large picnic lawns and portable washrooms for patrons.\n\nBard purchased its first 500-seat saddlespan tent in 1992. By the end of the 2010 season, the Mainstage theatre tent was in need of replacement and, following the \"Staging our Future\" capital campaign, the Festival built a custom-designed Mainstage theatre tent. The new tent expanded the seating capacity to 742 seats and included a redesigned stage. The theatre tent also came with more comfortable seating for patrons including cup holders for drinks purchased from the concession stands. The new tent maintains an open-backed design and Bard's signature backdrop: False Creek; the Coast Mountains; and city skyline. The physical playing space within the theatre was named after the Bank of Montreal in recognition of their lead contribution to the Festival's capital campaign.\n\nBard on the Beach typically stages two productions in repertory on the BMO Mainstage in each season, alongside a selection of choral, symphony and opera presentations. The set presents a unique challenge and opportunity for set designers from year to year as it must incorporate elements which can be shared by both productions during season.\n\nThe Douglas Campbell Theatre tent was added in 1999 as part of Bard's 10th anniversary season as an intimate space for the staging of Shakespeare's lesser-known works or for more modern, innovative stagings of the established canon. Beginning in 2005 with a production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard, the theatre tent has also served as a space for productions of plays which, while not by Shakespeare, serve to examine the context of his work.\n\nThe theatre is named for the Canadian stage actor Douglas Campbell. Campbell was a good friend and mentor to Christopher Gaze and had either performed in, or directed, plays in Bard's earlier seasons. Campbell and his son Torquil Campbell also performed together in productions of Henry IV, Part I and Macbeth at Bard on the Beach.\n\nThis smaller theatre tent seats 240 people and its adaptable layout and seating configuration are similar to that of a black box theatre. The tent structure was replaced at the beginning of the 2013 season as part of the \"Staging our Future\" capital campaign.\n\nIn 2014 the playing space was named the \"Howard Family Stage\" in honour of Vancouver philanthropists Darlene and Paul Howard.\n\nIn addition to operating the Festival, the Bard on the Beach Theatre Society operates a host of youth-oriented outreach programs under the umbrella of Bard Education. Collectively, the programs endeavour to inspire the community through dynamic, engaging experiences with the language, characters and plays of William Shakespeare.\n\nBard in the Classroom workshops are delivered by Teaching Artists - actors, directors and other theatre practitioners trained by Bard to facilitate workshops for young people. The in-class workshops can be adapted for all age groups have been delivered for students between the ages of 4 and 18. Teachers can request 90-minute sessions focusing on introductions to Shakespeare's work as a whole or focus on a specific play, scene or set of characters. Participants mix voice and language work with active theatre exercises to explore Shakespeare's work in a performance context.\n\nUnlike Bard Education's other programs, Bard's Professional Development workshops are open to educators of all grades, subjects, and levels of experience from across British Columbia. Like Bard in the Classroom, Bard's Professional Development workshops focus on introducing participants to Shakespeare through active theatre exercises however, the program is more focused on teacher training than those programs oriented for students and youth.\n\nThe Young Shakespeareans Workshop program has been offered each season on the grounds of Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival for youth aged 8 through 18 since 1993. The program runs between 15 and 17 two-week sessions for \"Juniors\" aged 8 to 13 and \"Seniors\" aged 13 to 18. There is also a one-week intensive theatre training program offered for youth aged 15 through 18.\n\nAs of the 2014 season, Young Shakespeareans Workshops Teaching Artists are also assisted by participants in the Riotous Youth apprenticeship program.\n\nConceived as a kind of \"graduate\" counterpart to the Young Shakespeareans Workshops, the Riotous Youth theatre apprenticeship program was launched in 2014 to provide an opportunity to bridge the learning of young theatre enthusiasts whom had aged out of the workshop program. Participants aged 19 through 24 take an active role in assisting Young Shakespeareans Workshops Teaching Artists, deliver pre-show introductory talks to the audience and work with a veteran Bard company actor to prepare a final presentation at the end of the season. The Riotous Youth also participate in a variety of other programs throughout the Bard season including the Bard-B-Q & Fireworks and off-site presentations.\n\nIn addition to the four plays, there are a number of events throughout the summer:\n\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, bard added a short series of Peak Performances to the Festival's season. A selection of weekend matinee performances were presented at the peak of Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver.\n\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n\n2016\n\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n\n2019 (30th Season)\n\n\n2020\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Georgia.\n\nOdell Thurman attended Jasper County High School in Monticello, Georgia. While there, he was a Macon Telegraph first team All-Purpose All-State selection at both linebacker and fullback, and won Class AA honorable mention All-State honors from the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", and was invited to play in the 2001 Georgia-Florida all-star game. As a senior, he rushed for 1,187 yards and recorded 153 tackles. His high school football coach was Steve Patterson.\n\nOdell Thurman played two years and 23 games at the University of Georgia where he was named an All-SEC player. Thurman was also a semi-finalist for the 2004 Dick Butkus Award. He entered the NFL draft after his junior season. The signature play of his career at Georgia came in a 26-7 win over Auburn in 2003. With Georgia leading 19-0, Auburn drove down to the Georgia 2 early in the fourth quarter. On third and goal, Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell threw a pass, which was deflected and intercepted by Thurman. He returned it 99 yards for a touchdown.\n\nThurman was selected 48th overall in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft and his excellent initial play on the field made him an instant candidate for the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award. Ultimately, San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman won the award.\n\nThurman was suspended for two seasons with the Bengals for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He was released from the Bengals before the start of the 2008 season.\n\nThurman was suspended by the National Football League for the first four games of the 2006 regular season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. According to sources, Thurman did not return to Cincinnati in time and failed to take the test.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, the NFL extended Thurman's suspension for the remainder of the season as a result of the arrest for drunk driving. Thurman's locker was emptied by the Bengals organization. Coach Marvin Lewis said he did not want to see Odell Thurman anywhere near the stadium, and he then deactivated Chris Henry for the next game for being part of the incident. Lewis later stated that he did not expect Thurman to play for the Bengals in 2007.\n\nOn February 21, 2007, Thurman pleaded no contest to the driving drunk charge and said he was undergoing treatment for alcohol abuse.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, Bengals' head coach Marvin Lewis told ESPN that Thurman would have the chance to return to the team, if reinstated by the NFL. Thurman was eligible for reinstatement on July 11, 2007. It was suspected that the organization would cut Thurman from the roster, but Lewis said otherwise.\n\nOn June 5, however, ESPN reported that he was wanted for assault in Georgia, for alleged kicking and hitting two men. Thurman and his brother were sought for questioning in connection with this assault. The sheriff involved in the case said that the incident was not quickly reported and that a magistrate would choose whether or not to continue with the charges on June 8, 2007. Conflicting reports from witnesses at the party where the assault allegedly occurred however may make prosecution of this case difficult.\n\nOn June 8, 2007, papers seeking to dismiss the charges stated above were filed, and charges against the linebacker were summarily dropped. Chrissy Pitts, deputy clerk of Magistrate Court in Jasper County, said \"It was settled, we aren’t aware of any terms that were involved in the settlement. That was between the attorneys and the parties.” \n\nOn July 25, 2007, Thurman's request for re-instatement into the NFL was denied by commissioner Roger Goodell, so he was not able to play in 2007.\n\nOn July 12, 2008, Thurman was indicted by a grand jury for breaking another man's jaw at a water park in Sandusky, Ohio during the previous month, though he was not arrested on the scene. On March 24, 2009, prosecutors dismissed the assault case against Thurman without prejudice citing insufficient evidence.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, The NFL cleared linebacker Thurman to resume working out with the Cincinnati Bengals, a step toward reinstatement from his two-year suspension.\n\nThurman was reinstated by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on April 21, 2008. \"Odell has met the NFL's conditions for reinstatement and has been added to our offseason roster,\" said Bengals coach Marvin Lewis.\n\nOn May 19, 2008, the Cincinnati Bengals waived Thurman, after Head Coach Marvin Lewis stated that the team \"had not seen the right steps taken by him.\" However, Thurman's representatives reported that the move was related to Thurman missing Offseason Training Activities (OTA's), which are not mandatory according to the NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nOn June 2, 2008, \"Sports Illustrated\" reported Thurman, recently cut by the Bengals, had failed his second drug test in three seasons. Four days later, ESPN reported Thurman had been suspended by the NFL indefinitely. As part of the ruling, he could not apply for reinstatement until after the 2008 season.\n\nThurman signed with the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League. In 2011, the team relocated to Virginia Beach, Virginia and became the Virginia Destroyers. Thurman has recently been spotted in attendance at his oldest son Odalyus's middle school football games at Jasper County Middle School, also in Thurman's hometown of Monticello, Georgia.\n\n"}

Enraged, Tommy forces Black to strip naked in front of the others, firing a handgun wildly into the floor.\n\nThe gang begins transporting heroin from Queens to Omaha, Nebraska, where they begin to overrun the local drug business. Big Head Rico (Tyrin Turner), an Omaha dealer, informs the police of their activities. The resulting raid at their stash-house ends with Mark's death and Knowledge's arrest. Knowledge angrily realizes that Tommy will not bail him out of jail, and calls Shameek, a.k.a. Father Sha (Method Man), to both infiltrate Rico's gang and kill Tommy. Shameek confronts Rico at a strip club and guns him down when he tries to flee. He is shot by the bartender and stumbles out the club, evading the police.\n\nTommy travels to Jamaica and repays Ox by killing Sosa, the son of a local drug lord. Back home, Tommy's girlfriend Keisha (Taral Hicks) is arrested by police and later bailed out by Tionne. Tommy finds out about the raid and leaves town. Pelpa, a close friend and associate of Sosa's, finds out that Ox ordered the hit and sends a hit squad to kill him in his home. Ox is able to kill most of the hitmen before he dies at the hands of a female assassin, Chiquita.\n\nSincere prepares to leave the drug trade and move his family to Africa, planning to leave on New Year's Day 2000. Meanwhile, while laying low in Atlanta, Tommy instigates an argument between Wise and LaKid, two marijuana dealers, in which ends with both men to drawing their guns and LaKid shooting Wise. After being arrested over the shooting, Tommy is coerced by a shadowy organization with unclear motives into assassinating a Black Muslim leader, Rev. Saviour, (Benjamin Chavis) during a sermon on New Year's Eve. Tionne comes home and finds herself confronted by Shameek, who demands the whereabouts of Sincere and Tommy.\n\nWhile Sincere talks to a friend (AZ) outside a barbershop, Black shoots him in the leg as revenge for his earlier humiliation. Sincere kills Black and his accomplice in self-defense before fleeing the scene. On New Year's Eve, Tommy confronts Rev. Saviour before his scheduled speech and points his gun at him. Saviour convinces Tommy not to go through with his mission, even though this will put his life at risk. \n\nA tearful Tommy agrees, and the two men embrace. Shameek visits Keisha's home, in the hopes of finding Tommy there. He assaults Keisha, who gets hold of Shameek's gun and shoots him in the face. Sincere, now in Africa with his family, reflects on recent events and is happy to start a new life.\n\n\nWhile filming \"Belly\", the production was mired by frequent clashes between Williams and the producers, budget constraints, and cast members showing up drunk, high, or late. Much of the $3 million budget was used up on the film's opening scene, which was filmed in the former Tunnel nightclub in New York City. The film's costume designer, June Ambrose, recalled that Williams wanted the film's \"shiny look\" to \"forecast what the hip-hop genre's gonna look like in the millennium.\" Williams revealed that Jay-Z was considered for the film's title role.\n\nThe film was poorly received by critics, scoring a 16% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although it was generally praised for its highly stylized \"noir-like\" visual design and cinematography, it was criticized for what was seen as a weak plot.\nSince then the film has developed a cult following. Clayton Purdom of \"The A.V. Club\" described \"Belly\" as a \"far from a perfect film, but it radiates talent, both from Williams and the musicians he captured at their commercial and artistic peak.\" Khris Davenport of \"Complex\" doubled down on the film's legacy and influence, writing that Williams \"blazed a trail in black cinema that some filmmakers are only just now starting to understand and build upon.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2032683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032683", "title": "Boys/Girls State", "text": "Boys/Girls State\n\nAL Boys State and ALA Girls State are summer leadership and citizenship programs sponsored by The American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary for high school juniors, respectively. Boys and Girls are usually nominated by their high school during their junior year. Boys and Girls State programs both began in 1937 and are held in each of the U.S. states (except Hawai'i where there is a Girls State program), usually at a college within that state. In general, male and female programs are held separately, but at least seven states—Georgia, Nebraska, Oregon, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island—host Boys and Girls State on the same campus on the same week.\n\nEach state's program varies, but in general program participants are divided into subgroups referred to as cities. The citizens of each of these cities elect mock municipal officials and representatives to the mock state legislature. Many programs also have a county level as well. The participants also elect state officials, such as governor, lieutenant governor, and other state-level officials mirroring their actual State. The legislature meets to organize, elect leaders, and to pass bills, in a way that is similar to how their actual state legislature operates. Some programs tend to have a more traditional education focus, providing speakers and training throughout the week and then concluding with mock political functions. Other programs take a more hands-on approach by running the mock government activities all week.\n\nAll programs generally follow a similar pattern, but vary by state. Some states hold mock trials, the participants volunteering as lawyers, accused, and juries. Some states include a journalism component that represents the Fourth Estate in the political process. North Dakota includes a classroom-based emergency management simulation that requires participants to respond to various large-scale disasters by managing communication, resources and personnel. Other programs include creative and fun activities such as band, choir, and athletic competition. Some of the programs (e.g., New Mexico) host a dance during the week, inviting high school girls/boys from the area to attend. The Oregon program has moved away from using any mock systems to a completely simulated \"State of Christensen\" with its own law and order system that grows yearly and is passed on to the consecutive year.\n\nBoys/Girls State is typically staffed by Legion members, past participants, and/or community leaders who volunteer their time and effort. Administrative costs are defrayed by their state Legion organizations and local businesses.\n\nSelection varies by state and by girls or boys state program. Historically, in most states, only one or two students are sent to Boys/Girls State from each high school. Therefore, selection is highly competitive, and the population of students attending represents the top talent from across the state. \nAlthough recruitment procedures vary, Boys/Girls State participants are often selected with the help of high school principals or guidance counselors. Participants are between their junior and senior years in high school to qualify.\n\nBecause the hundreds of students at any given Boys/Girls State represent the top talent of that age year, being elected to a high office, such as governor, at the event can be an important distinguishing achievement for college or Military Academies admissions.\n\nWhile each state's offerings differ, many programs offer College Credit to those attending Boys/Girls State. Additionally many colleges and universities offer scholarships and other awards to those attending a Boys/Girls State program. Also, The American Legion offers The Samsung Scholarship which is an endowed scholarship fund of $5 million to be administered by The American Legion. In 2010, ten $20,000 scholarships and 88 $1,000 scholarships were awarded to those who completed a Boys/Girls State program. Attendance at Boys State carries the same weight as earning the distinction of Eagle Scout, especially when applying to US military schools and academies.\n\nOnce there, students typically engage in a number of political activities such as running for office, electing officials, drafting and debating bills, and making motions. Some programs offer City and County mock courts, and a state Supreme Court, with the participants acting as lawyers, judges, plaintiffs, defendants, and jury members. Additionally, there are lectures and workshops for students to fully immerse themselves in government and politics.\n\nA majority of programs divide their participants into two political parties: Nationalists and Federalists. Each political party establishes an official party platform voted on by its members. Participants are elected to a variety of offices including House of Representatives and Senate seats, executive offices (governor, lieutenant governor, Secretary of State, treasurer, etc.). Participants also run for city and county offices such as mayor, county clerk, municipal judge, city councilman, and many more depending on the individual program's setup.\n\nSome programs, given their proximity to their state Capital, make a field trip to visit and have a tour and meet their Representatives, if they are present.\nMany programs handle aspects of their individual programs differently from other States. For example, New York Boys' State involves exposure to regimented military experiences, such as early-morning physical training and marching instruction provided by members of the US Marines.\n\nThe creation of the Boys State program in 1935 is credited to Hayes Kennedy, who was an instructor at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law and Americanism Chairman of the Illinois Department of The American Legion, and Harold Card, the Department Boy Scout Chairman and junior high school instructor. Hayes Kennedy and Harold Card became concerned about the youth attending political indoctrination camps in the late 1930s.\n\nDocumentation provided by various Boys State programs across the country refer to these as \"Young Pioneer Camps\" and alternately describe them as either fascist- or communist-inspired. Since the Young Pioneer Camps was the name of a youth program based in the Soviet Union that made inroads in the U.S. in the early 20th century, it is likely that these left-wing movements are what Kennedy was responding to, and not the growth of the radical left. Kennedy felt that a counter movement must be started among the ranks of the nation's youth to stress the importance and value of a democratic form of government and maintain an effort to preserve and perpetuate it.\n\nThe Illinois Department of The American Legion approved Hayes Kennedy's and Harold Card's project and in June 1935, the very first Boys State in the nation was held on the grounds of the Illinois State Fair.\n\nAs this program succeeded and spread throughout the United States, the American Legion Auxiliary began providing similar opportunities for girls of high school age. Thus Girls State was founded. The first Girls State was conducted in 1937 and since 1948 has been a regular part of the Auxiliary's better citizenship programs. In Arkansas, the Girls State program began in 1942 under the leadership of Maud Crawford, the first woman to practice law in Camden, Arkansas. By 1984, Girls State sessions were held in all fifty states.\n\nin 1981, Louisiana Boys State delegate Kirt Givens of Tioga High School in Pineville died when he fell or jumped out of his 12th floor Kirby Smith dorm room window at Louisiana State University while sleepwalking.\n\nA documentary film on the program, focused on Texas Boys State, is slated to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020.\n\nAttendance data from 1935–1995 is unavailable.\nSince 1947, each of these Boys State and Girls State programs sends two delegates to Boys Nation and Girls Nation in Washington, D.C.. Each state chooses their delegates differently. These delegates are sometimes the participants elected to the governor and lieutenant governor positions, but other states have separate elections for the honor, while still other states appoint their delegates through interviews with the Legionnaires who run each state program.\n\nThe event endeavors to teach delegates about the processes of federal government in the United States of America, through taking part in a mock Senate and mock elections of a Boys/Girls Nation Senate President Pro Tempore and Secretary, Vice President, and President, attending lectures and fora, and visiting governmental institutions and historical sites.\n\nNotable alumni of the Boys and Girls State programs include:\n\n\n"}

The parish lies immediately east of Bishop's Cleeve; the village is about north of Cheltenham. In old English the name meant 'woodmen's cottage' and an early form was Wudumannacote. In the southeast of the parish is the small village of Cleeve Hill, under the slopes of the hill of the same name.\n\nThere is also an area called Woodmancote in Dursley, also in Gloucestershire.\n\nThe maps above highlight the fact that no significant development occurred between 1828 and 1945, only infrastructure such as new roads and a railway line seem to be new features. The physical lack of development is also shown in its neighbouring village Bishop's Cleeve. It does show a large amount of arable land as fields in both maps. This would suggest that the people who lived there were mostly working in agriculture for many generations.\n\nThe Domesday Book (1086) does not include Woodmancote. It became a place in its own right when estates in the area were organised by the Bishop's officers around 1170. Over centuries Woodmancote remained an area of smallholdings and arable fields. Only in 1847 the traditional farming of the villagers on medieval open-fields ended, as arable land became enclosed into the fields we see today. For 600 years Bishop's Cleeve and Woodmancote have been hard to define as two separate parishes. This was because both were \"in the same manor of the Bishop of Worcester and so it is often impossible to distinguish in his records\". The Black Death saw one third of the population of Bishop's Cleeve and Woodmancote die.\n\nIn the 1870s, Woodmancote was described by John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as:\n\nThe village is the home of the Woodmancote Evangelical Free Church, part of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion.\n\nThe map above shows the change in boundaries of the Woodmancote civil parish over time, with the newer boundary line adjacent to the railway line and the old boundary covering roughly half of what today is part of Bishop's Cleeve.\n\nThe boundaries of Woodmancote changed in 1883 and 1953. It gained 120 acres from the Bushcombe Island that was part of Bishop’s Cleeve. It gained again another 46 acres in April 1953 but lost 143 acres south of Station Road to Bishop’s Cleeve. The railway line is still part of Woodmancote. Since 1953, the village comprises 886 acres.\n\nThe main road running through Woodmancote is called Station Road as it led to Bishop's Cleeve railway station. This road leads straight into Bishop's Cleeve to the west and Cheltenham to the south. From there, the M5 is easily accessible.\n\nWoodmancote and Bishop's Cleeve were once served by a railway line that divides the two parishes. It was created on 1 June 1906 by the Great Western Railway which ran from Stratford-upon-Avon and finished at Cheltenham. The railway station closed on 7 March 1960 and was demolished. An accident occurred later on the railway line which led to its dismantlement by 1980.\nA 12-mile stretch of the track has been reconstructed through Woodmancote which has been reopened and is now preserved as heritage of the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.\n\nIn 1886 a medical examiner of Woodmancote reported very serious sanitary problems. Nearly all of the drinking water sources such as wells and ditches were condemned. Woodmancote was connected to mains water four years later in 1891.\nThe first telephone exchange in Woodmancote was opened by the National Telephone Company in 1899. The local hotel named the Rising Sun was the first to receive a number which was 502.\n\nThe Cheltenham District Gas Company supplied gas to Woodmancote from around 1925. Electricity was not supplied until after World War II, however Cleeve Hill had mains installed underground in the 1930s.\n\nWoodmancote's development has been stunted because of where it is located: its position at the foot of Cleeve Hill gives the settlement only a westerly direction to expand, but only to an extent before it reaches the boundary of Bishop's Cleeve.\n\nIn the 1841 census, the first schoolteacher was recorded for Woodmancote, George Sheppard at the age of 25. In the 1851 census, three women schoolmistresses were recorded but in the 1861 census none remained in the village. It wasn't until 1906 to 1910 that a school was started by Miss Waghorne. A larger, six-classroom primary school was built by the County Council in 1972 on Station Road.\n\nThis graph shows the total population at 10 year intervals recorded by the Census in the United Kingdom since 1871 (no census data from 1941 as the National census did not occur then).\n\nAs from 2011, Woodmancote had a population of 3,029 according to the 2011 census. The graph shows an initial decrease in total population from the years 1871-1891 to 312, however from that point the population gradually increased to the year 1961 with 1,146 inhabitants. From that point the increase accelerated with a sudden drop from 2,922 in 1991 to 2,630 in 2001.\n\nWoodmancotes Demographics is typical of a rural village as it has an increasingly aging population.\n\nThis graph shows the average number of people per house in Woodmancote. From 1881 to 1901 there are about 3 people per house, however this increases to almost 4.5 people per house in 1920. From this point it decreases to the current level of 2.5 people per house. As the population graph shows an increase in population during this time, this would mean that there has been an increase in the construction of new houses.\n\nThese charts show the types of jobs that occurred in 1881 and 2011 and the number of people who had them as professions. The charts indicate that within the 130 years of these censuses, occupations have developed from the primary sector such as agriculture to the service sector such as administration.\n\n"}

He earned a B.A. in 1983 from Colgate University, Hamilton, New York, where he played lacrosse—finishing his career with 184 points, second all-time at Colgate. Woodruff earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1987, and he is an alumnus of Theta Chi Fraternity.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Woodruff worked as a bankruptcy associate at Shearman & Sterling, LLC., in New York City. In 1989, while Woodruff was teaching law in Beijing, China, CBS News hired him as an on-screen interpreter during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Shortly thereafter, he left the law practice and became a full-time correspondent, initially working for several local stations.\n\nWoodruff began working for ABC News in 1996. He succeeded Peter Jennings as a co-anchor of \"ABC World News Tonight\" in December 2005. In January 2006, Woodruff was critically wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq.\n\nOn January 29, 2006, Woodruff and Canadian cameraman Doug Vogt were seriously injured in an explosion from an improvised explosive device near Taji, Iraq, about north of Baghdad. Woodruff had traveled with an ABC News team to Israel to report on the aftermath of the 2006 Palestinian elections, and then via Amman to Baghdad, so that he could meet with troops before President George W. Bush's State of the Union address for 2006.\n\nAt the time of the attack, they were embedded with the U.S. 4th Infantry Division, traveling in an Iraqi MT-LB. Woodruff and Vogt were standing with their heads above a hatch, apparently filming a stand-up. Both men were wearing body armor and protective helmets at the time. Woodruff sustained shrapnel wounds; Vogt was struck by shrapnel in the head, and suffered a broken shoulder. Both men underwent surgery for head injuries with a joint Army and Air Force neurosurgical team at the U.S. Air Force hospital south of Balad, located in Camp Anaconda, and were reported to be in stable condition. Tom Brokaw reported on the \"Today\" show that Woodruff had also undergone surgery, with a portion of his skull being removed to reduce the damage from brain swelling.\n\nWoodruff and Vogt were evacuated to the U.S. Army's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany overnight on Sunday, January 29. On ABC \"World News Tonight\" that evening, anchor Elizabeth Vargas discussed the dangers of reporting in a combat zone. After leaving Germany, Woodruff was treated for several weeks at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nWoodruff was kept in a medically induced coma for 36 days to assist his recovery, and ABC News temporarily assigned \"Good Morning America\" anchors Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer to alternate duties on the evening newscast as co-anchors with Vargas. Vogt meanwhile was reported to be awake, mobile, and recovering.\n\nAs of March 7, 2006, Woodruff's brother reported that the ABC anchor was beginning to walk, recognize friends and family, and speak in several languages. However, he struggled with expressive aphasia for more than a year after the injury. Woodruff was transferred on March 16, 2006, to a medical facility closer to his Westchester County, New York, home, a sign of \"continued progress in all respects\", ABC News President, David Westin, said in an e-mail to staffers.\nWestin's email noted that Woodruff was able to get around, talk to and joke with his family, but that \"months of further recuperation\" were still required.\n\nOn April 6, 2006, ABC News released photos of Woodruff recovering at home, along with a letter thanking everyone for their support and kindness during his ongoing recovery. Woodruff especially thanked the soldiers, doctors, and nurses who had saved his life. On December 29, 2006, Woodruff's wife, Lee, an editor at \"Family Fun Magazine\" appeared on \"Good Morning America\" to discuss family activities to celebrate the New Year. During the report, anchor Kate Snow asked Lee about her husband's condition. Lee said that Bob was doing well and was currently filming a television documentary about his experiences. She also revealed that he had been back to Iraq since the incident to visit the soldiers with whom he was traveling at the time of his injury.\n\nABC's \"World News Tonight\" remained second in the Nielsen Media Research rankings, though it had lost some ground to NBC's then first-place \"Nightly News\", anchored by Brian Williams before his ouster. Bob Schieffer on \"CBS Evening News\" also closed the gap with ABC after Woodruff's injury. On May 23, 2006, Vargas announced her resignation from \"WNT\", citing her doctors' recommendation to cut back her schedule considerably due to her upcoming maternity leave, and her wish to spend more time with her new baby. Gibson was then named sole anchor of the show, effective May 29, 2006.\n\nOn February 27, 2007, Woodruff appeared on \"Good Morning America\", \"ABC World News with Charles Gibson\", and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", in advance of a documentary that aired on ABC later that evening. Despite having made great progress in his recovery, during the GMA interview with Diane Sawyer, Woodruff had some difficulty remembering words and details, such as the name of the Vietnam War and the word \"injury\". The hour-long documentary, \"To Iraq and Back: Bob Woodruff Reports‚\" explored the consequences of traumatic brain injury and highlighted the difficulties brain injured veterans face finding treatment—a subject that had first appeared in \"Discover\" magazine several weeks earlier, and was elaborated on by \"Washington Post\" reporters in the exposé \"Painting Over the Problems at Walter Reed's Building 18\".\n\nWoodruff resumed his contributions to \"ABC World News with Charles Gibson\" the following day, February 28, with the first in a series of follow-up reports centering on the problems that wounded American soldiers are encountering in their treatment and recovery, particularly at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Starting March 7, he was scheduled to begin reporting for \"Nightline\" \"at regular intervals\".\n\nOn July 12, 2008, Woodruff began hosting a new weekly ABC News–produced newscast, \"Focus Earth with Bob Woodruff\", on the Planet Green television channel. On \"Focus Earth\", Woodruff covered the environmental news of the week, looking at subjects ranging from climate impact, environmental policy, political debate, and world events, as well as how climate change affects religious and cultural views and issues.\n\nThe Bob Woodruff Foundation (BWF) is a nonprofit that wants to help post-9/11 injured service members, veterans, and their families after they return home.\n\nIn 2014, Woodruff was awarded the third highest honor within the Department of the Army Civilian Awards, the Outstanding Civilian Service Award, for substantial contributions to the U.S. Army community through his work with the Woodruff Foundation.\n\nWoodruff married Lee McConaughy in 1988, and they have four children, Macklin Robert (Mack), Cathryn, and twins Claire and Nora.\n\nWoodruff is not related to television journalist Judy Woodruff.\n\nWoodruff has received numerous journalism awards, including:\n\n"}

The party sought to revive the inter-war party of the same name and to present itself as having a 'civic' and 'centrist' identity. However, the DS was characterised by a number of heterogeneous groups and strands of opinion.\n\nAn element within the party was opposed in certain respects to the orientation that prominent figures and former \"Praxis\" group members Dragoljub Mićunović and Zoran Đinđić advocated. This group included Kosta Čavoški, Nikola Milošević and Vojislav Koštunica. Their analysis stressed a need for the DS to play a stronger anti-communist role.\n\nIn the run-up to the 1990 general election, the Associated Opposition of Serbia addressed an open letter to Slobodan Milošević calling for a ninety-day election campaign, two hours of television air time allocated to the opposition, for all parties to have representation in electoral bodies and renewed their appeal for round-table talks. The open letter was presented to a rally of around 40,000 by Čavoški on 12 September. The government responded by granting some concessions to the opposition, including provision for opposition access to the television during the campaign and a reduction in the number of signatures needed for a candidate's nomination. While unhappy, Mićunović and Đinđić championed a resolution passed by the DS Main Committee on 8 October that the DS would participate in the election. Đinđić argued that the opposition could not ignore the opportunity to 'record the illegal actions of the ruling Socialists and inform the public of them'. On 9 October a number of leading figures expressed their dissatisfaction with this resolution and advocated an election boycott, including Čavoški, Milošević, Aleksandar Petrović, Milan Božić and Vladeta Janković.\n\nThe failure of the Serbian opposition to achieve a breakthrough at the 1990 general election led to a period of introspection and realignment among the opposition parties. The faction of the Democratic Party (DS) that had favoured an election boycott blamed the centrist party leader Dragoljub Mićunović for the catastrophic defeat which they had suffered. In their view, the policy of participation, favoured by Mićunović and Zoran Đinđić, had conferred political legitimacy on the Milošević regime whilst yielding little electoral reward in return. There was a strong correlation between the individuals who supported this position and those who had opposed Mićunović on the national issue during the DS congress of the previous September.\n\nOn 22 January 1991, this group, including the academicians Nikola Milošević and Kosta Čavoški, Mićunović's former opponent in the intra-party election, as well as Vladan Vasiljević, director Aleksandar Petrović and mathematician Milan Božić, left the Democratic Party to form the Serbian Liberal Party (SLS). The party was also supported by other prominent academicians such as Vasilije Krestić, Smilja Avramov, Milo Lompar and Žarko Trebješanin.\n\nHaving removed themselves from the main body of the DS, and no longer having to accommodate the 'rationalist' beliefs of the \"Praxis\" group, the SLS took on an increasingly traditional ideological hue. On 16 October 1991, the SLS formally changed its policy from one of republicanism to monarchism. On 21 October, it played a key role in founding the Movement for the Rebirth of the Constitutional Monarchy. Čavoški stated that the introduction of a constitutional monarchy in Serbia would mark a symbolic yet radical break with the past. While the formation of the SLS was marked by the departure from the DS of some of its founding members and key figures from the 'anti-communist/national' wing of the party, this current continued to be represented by influential individuals such as Vojislav Koštunica and Borislav Pekić and the SLS was not in the long term able to pose a serious challenge to their former party. Zoran Đinđić took over the role of head of the DS Executive Committee which had been vacated by Čavoški.\n\nThe SLS joined the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) and New Democracy in the short-lived United Serbian Democratic Oppositon (USDO) alliance on 22 May 1991. The alliance held a rally on Republic Square on 9 June 1991. Unlike the 9 March demonstration, it was not banned by the authorities and went ahead without violent incident. The rally was condemned by Vojislav Šešelj as an 'act of treason' after which the USDO hit back, labelling his supporters 'Red Četniks' and himself the 'Red Vojvoda' for his perceived close relationship to the socialist Milošević regime. The alliance did not include the Democratic Party which was opposed to it both on organisational and ideological grounds, declaring that the nationalist orientation of the USDO was contrary to its civic ideology. The USDO contested for the seat in Rakovica in late June after the death of SPS member and writer Miodrag Bulatović. Their candidate Jovan Marjanović went up against Borislav Pekić from the DS and Vojislav Šešelj from the SRS, as well as a minor member of the SPS, Radoš Karaklajić. Šešelj was elected and the USDO fragmented and ceased to operate during the summer of 1991.\n\nOn 23 May 1992, the SLS joined the Democratic Movement of Serbia (DEPOS) coalition with the SPO, New Democracy and the Serbian Peasants Party. The leadership of the Democratic Party refused to join, stating that parties that made up the DEPOS were 'fixated on popular fronts' and citing their disagreement with the strong monarchist and neo-traditionalist orientation of the coalition. Democratic Party founder and former \"Praxis\" intellectual Ljubomir Tadić spoke scornfully of the SPO, as well as \"its satellite, the Liberal Party\". The right wing of the DS under Vojislav Koštunica would split in late July 1992 to form the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), after which the DSS joined DEPOS.\n\nThe SLS withdrew from the DEPOS together with the DSS in November 1993, in the run-up to the 1993 election. It announced that it would boycott the elections, which it regarded as an electoral device being used by Slobodan Milošević to consolidate his personal power. However, high ranking member of the SLS Milan Božić chose to stay with the DEPOS, and would later join the SPO acting as a key advisor to Vuk Drašković.\n\nUnder the new leadership of Zoran Đinđić, the DS started to pursue a 'national democratic' course from late 1994 into 1995. Dragoljub Mićunović was expelled on 2 December 1995, and on 3 December it was announced that a new Democratic Alliance (DA) was being formed, a coalition which would unite the DS, DSS, SLS and the Assembly National Party (SNS) of former SPO member Slobodan Rakitić. The coalition broke down in March 1996 when the DS joined the Zajedno coaliton with the SPO and Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS), a move Kosta Čavoški described as \"unnatural\" and \"a betrayal of Serbian national interest\".\n\nThe SLS boycotted the 1997 election, together with the DS, DSS, GSS and SNS.\n\nIn the 2003 parliamentary election the party obtained one seat in the National Assembly, being part of a list headed by the DSS.\n\nFollowing Nikola Milošević's death in 2007, the party was led by Milovan Jeremić. The Serbian Liberal Party officially ceased to exist on 24 January 2010. Its legal successor is the Serbian Liberal Council ( or \"Srpski liberalni savet\") citizen's group.\n\nThe SLS has played a prominent role in several requests for rehabilitation.\n\nOn 3 May 2006 the SLS, along with several other parties including the youth wing of the Democratic Party of Serbia, submitted a request for the rehabilitation of Slobodan Jovanović, Prime Minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile and president of the conservative Serbian Cultural Club. Jovanović was rehabilitated on 26 October 2007, and his remains were transferred to Serbia and reburied on 10 December 2011.\n\nBesides their political work, the Serbian Liberal Party has published several texts of its prominent members, as well as \"Liberal (The Liberal)\", a monthly magazine edited by Vladan Banković between 1994 and 1995.\n\n\n"}

Šešelj left the party in 1991 after internal quarrels and founded the Serbian Radical Party.\n\nThe Democratic Movement of Serbia was formed in May 1992 as a political alliance made up primarily of SPO, New Democracy (ND), Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). The political alliance however broke, and was dissolved in 1993. The SPO was part of the \"Together\" (\"Zajedno\") coalition in the 1996 parliamentary election which received 23.8% of the popular vote, losing to the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). In 1997, Drašković ran twice for president but finished third in both elections. Its party won the third largest number of seats in that year's Serbian parliamentary elections. A dissident group inside the party abandoned the SPO and formed New Serbia (NS) in 1997.\n\nIn early 1999, the SPO joined the Slobodan Milošević-led government, and Drašković became a Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister. The SPO had a place in Serbia's Rambouillet Agreement delegation and held posts such as the Yugoslav Information Ministry to show a more pro-Western face to the world in the run-up to NATO's bombing campaign in 1999 against the country. In the midst of the war, Drašković and the SPO pulled out of the government, calling on Milošević to surrender to NATO.\n\nThe SPO participated in an attempt to overthrow Milošević in 1999, which faltered after Drašković broke off his alliance with opposition leader Zoran Đinđić. This caused the anti-Milošević elements to suggest that he was working for Milošević.\n\nIn 2000 presidential and parliamentary elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in which Milošević lost, the Serbian Renewal Movement overestimated its strength and ran independently, outside of the vast Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition. Vojislav Mihajlović, grandson of Chetnik commander Draža Mihajlović, was its presidential candidate. He was opposed by Vojislav Koštunica of DOS, Slobodan Milošević of the ruling SPS and Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Radical Party. The SPO's vote collapsed, with its traditional voters drawn by Kostunica's conservative nationalism and by the fact that he was their best hope to remove Milošević from power.\n\nThere was talk before the 5 October coup d'état of dissolving the Mirko Marjanović government in Serbia and setting up a government with the Serbian Radical Party. Following the coup, the SPO participated in a so-called national unity government that served effectively under DOS \"coordinator\" Zoran Đinđić. In December 2000, after two months of DOS rule, Serbian parliamentary elections were held. The SPO, once the strongest opposition, failed to enter the parliament.\n\nIn 2003, Drašković called for the re-establishment of a parliamentary monarchy in Serbia as the best means for its European integration.\n\nThe party fought the December 2003 legislative elections in a coalition with New Serbia. The coalition received 7.7% of the popular vote and 22 seats in parliament. 13 of these were allocated to the SPO. In turn, the coalition had dispatched 8 deputies into the federal Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nSPO-NS became part of Vojislav Koštunica's first elected cabinet. Vuk Drašković was selected for Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nFollowing a split in the party, 9 members of parliament joined the newly formed Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement leaving the SPO with only 4. One of the 4 was then bought off by the political tycoon Bogoljub Karić to form his party's list.\n\nThe SPO participated in the 2007 election independently and received 3.33% of the vote, winning no seats.\n\nIn the 2008 elections the SPO took part in the For a European Serbia coalition under President Boris Tadić, receiving 38.42% of the vote and 102 seats in parliament. Four seats were given to the SPO along with the Ministry of Diaspora portfolio.\n\n"}

When asked to encode a message consisting of \"k\" bits, where formula_1 holds, the RM(\"r\", \"m\") code produces a codeword consisting of 2 bits.\n\nReed–Muller codes are named after David E.

The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, as part of a duopoly with ABC affiliate KNXV-TV (channel 15). KASW's studios are located on East Missouri Avenue in Uptown Phoenix, and its transmitter is located on South Mountain on the city's south side. Master control and most internal operations are based at KNXV-TV's studios along North 44th Street on the city's east side (north of Sky Harbor International Airport and next to the Loop 202 and SR 143 interchange). There is no separate website for KASW; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KNXV-TV.\n\nKASW's signal is relayed across northern and eastern Arizona through a small network of five translators.\n\nPrior to KASW's sign-on, the UHF channel 61 frequency in the Phoenix market was originally occupied by low-power station K61CA; that station carried a locally programmed music video format and operated from March 1983 until December 1984.\n\nIn 1988, K61CA was owned by Channel 61 Development Corporation and was a satellite-fed relay of KSTS-TV, a Telemundo affiliate (now owned-and-operated station) in San Jose, California.\n\nBy 1991, preparations had been made to sign on another independent station in Phoenix, under the callsign KAIK. The station's construction permit and eventual license bore these calls into 1994, until the license was purchased by the Brooks family the following year, after which the call letters were changed to KASW. The station first signed on the air on September 22, 1995; just prior to its sign-on, the Brooks entered into a local marketing agreement with MAC America Communications, then-owners of KTVK (channel 3, which was in the concluding stages of its transition from an ABC affiliate into an independent station at the time).\nKTVK had acquired a large inventory of syndicated programs as it transitioned to a news-intensive independent station. However, it didn't have enough time to air it all. As part of the LMA with the Brooks family, MAC America leased KASW's entire broadcast day and moved much of this excess programming to channel 61. The programming included cartoons (such as \"The Jetsons\", \"The Flintstones\", \"Double Dragon\", \"\" and \"Sailor Moon\"), classic sitcoms (such as \"Happy Days\", \"The Brady Bunch\", \"Bewitched\", \"Gilligan's Island\" and \"All in the Family\"), older movies and a few recent sitcoms (such as \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\", \"Blossom\", \"Family Matters\", \"The Simpsons\" and \"Who's the Boss?\"). KASW also joined The WB; KTVK had nominally been that network's Phoenix affiliate, but aired WB programming on Saturday nights between the network's launch and September 1995.\n\nToward the end of 1995, KTVK had also moved Fox Kids (which it carried in lieu of KSAZ-TV, channel 10, which declined the block once it switched to Fox in December 1994, and once it moved to KASW had aired in addition to The WB's own children's block, Kids' WB, thus creating a similar children's programming inventory as Cleveland's WB affiliate WBNX) and other syndicated programs to KASW. These changes allowed KTVK to reinstate its Saturday morning newscasts, while KASW began airing a half-hour 9 p.m. newscast produced by KTVK, which was discontinued in 1997 (after which it moved to KTVK as a one-hour broadcast). When Belo bought most of MAC America's television properties in 1999, the local marketing agreement with KASW was included in the transaction. This move further boosted its programming quality. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) started allowing duopolies in 2000, Belo bought KASW outright.\nDue to changes in the industry, from about 1998 to about 2004, KASW began to gradually shift its programming away from classic sitcoms, movies and cartoons. The station began to phase in more talk shows, reality shows and court shows to its schedule. It finally dropped weekday cartoons in January 2006, when The WB discontinued the Kids' WB weekday afternoon lineup (while retaining and expanding its Saturday morning block).\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB (which Time Warner jointly owned with Tribune Company) and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW, which would launch on September 18, 2006. On March 8, Belo signed an affiliation agreement with the network for KASW to become The CW's Phoenix charter affiliate; the market's UPN affiliate KUTP (channel 45) became an owned-and-operated station of MyNetworkTV thirteen days before the launch of The CW on September 5 (MyNetworkTV was created by KUTP's then-parent News Corporation after the UPN affiliates it owned through the company's Fox Television Stations unit were passed over for initial affiliations with The CW in favor of stations owned by CBS Television Stations and Tribune Broadcasting).\n\nKASW only tweaked its branding to reflect its new network affiliation, keeping the \"6\" that represents its cable channel position in the area on Cox Communications (satellite providers carry KASW on channel 61). The station also aired its own CW \"man-on-the-street\" promos before the switch. The images and links on its website, Quick6.com, were revamped a week before the change and feature a new \"Quick6\" logo.\n\nThe station ran Vortexx, a successor of The CW4Kids (which in turn, was the successor of Kids' WB), later known as Toonzai on Saturday mornings. It also aired children's programming from 4Kids TV on Sunday mornings until the block was discontinued by Fox on December 27, 2008 (therefore, children's programs on KASW that aired on both Saturday \"and\" Sunday mornings were essentially programmed by one company, 4Kids Entertainment, for seven months). These properties, in one form or another, were carried on KTVK when that station was the market's original charter affiliate of The WB in 1995 and were moved to KASW in September 1995 and 1996, respectively. The same situation occurred in other markets, in which a station picked up the rights to the 4Kids lineup from an existing Fox affiliate (like KFRE-TV in Fresno, which assumed rights from KMPH-TV) or due to rejection by stations that Fox inherited from New World Communications (as was the case with KTVK, and WBNX-TV in Cleveland).\n\nOn June 13, 2013, Belo announced that KTVK and KASW would be acquired by the Gannett Company, owner of KPNX and the \"Arizona Republic\". Since this would give Gannett control of three stations in the Phoenix market, Gannett announced that it would spin off KTVK and KASW to Sander Media, LLC (operated by former Belo executive Jack Sander). While Gannett intended to provide services to the stations through a shared services agreement, KTVK and KASW's operations would have remained largely separate from KPNX and the \"Republic\". On December 23, 2013, shortly after the approval and completion of the Gannett/Belo deal, the Meredith Corporation announced that it would purchase KTVK and the non-license assets of KASW from Sander Media and Gannett in a $407.5 million deal. As Meredith already owns CBS affiliate KPHO-TV (channel 5), the KASW license was instead sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting, with Meredith operating the station under a shared services agreement.\n\nThe FCC approved the sale of KASW and KTVK to SagamoreHill and Meredith on June 17, 2014, and the deal closed two days later. The two companies also agreed to voluntarily divest KASW to an independent buyer within 90 days of the deal's closure; on October 23, 2014, Meredith and SagamoreHill announced that it would sell KASW to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $68 million, giving the company its first station in the Phoenix market. The FCC approved the sale to Nexstar on December 19, and the sale was consummated on January 30, 2015, ending a nearly 20-year partnership between KASW and KTVK, which launched channel 61 in 1995. The station began migrating out of KTVK's facilities in September 2015.\n\nOn March 20, 2019, as part of its proposed acquisition of Tribune Media, Nexstar announced that it would sell KASW and seven other stations to the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company, owner of local ABC affiliate KNXV-TV (channel 15). The sale would create the third duopoly in the Phoenix market after Fox Television Stations' KSAZ-TV/KUTP and Meredith Corporation's KPHO-TV/KTVK. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKASW shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 61, at 4:30 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (the switchover was originally scheduled for 12:01 a.m. in order for the analog signal to be shut down at the same time as its sister station KTVK; however, it was delayed for unknown reasons). The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 49. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 61, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nIn addition to the CW network schedule, Syndicated programming featured on KASW includes \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Judge Mathis\", \"Lauren Lake's Paternity Court\", \"The Simpsons\", \"2 Broke Girls\", and \"Friends\" among others. Though KASW aired 4Kids TV and its previous iterations until Fox discontinued their children's program blocks in December 2008, KASW declined to pick up its successor block, \"Weekend Marketplace\", which now airs on independent station KAZT-TV (channel 7).\n\nKASW served as the former over-the-air broadcast home of the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes, airing the team's games from the time that the franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 until 2006, when the Coyotes announced the move of their over-the-air telecasts to KAZT-TV. The station also became the first ever broadcast home of the Arizona Rattlers from 1999 to the 2004 season until the Rattlers moved their broadcasts to Fox Sports Arizona in the 2005 season. In 2018, the Rattlers announced they would be airing their home games on KASW for the 2019 season. KASW also carried a 2013 Arizona Cardinals wild card playoff game airing on and produced by ESPN on January 3, 2014 in order to ensure local over-the-air coverage of the game (for future seasons, all ABC stations simulcast said ESPN game nationwide).\n\nFrom 2014 to 2019, KASW served as the Phoenix affiliate for Raycom Sports' ACC Network.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, the station broadcast Major League Soccer games involving Real Salt Lake, simulcasting from Salt Lake City's MyNetworkTV affiliate KMYU. In 2019, KASW became the official broadcast partner of Phoenix Rising FC of the USL Championship.\n\nIn January 2016, KASW premiered its first ever original program, \"Politics in the Yard\", a talk show hosted by Jaime Molera. KASW also announced a partnership with Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication to launch the \":60 Second Download\", a news break segment that airs at the top of the hour before each program.\n\n\n"}

In 2009, it published a set of documents leaked by a Baidu employee which revealed events, people and places that were deemed politically sensitive.\n\nThe types of words, phrases and web addresses being censored by the government include names of Chinese high level leadership; protest and dissident movements; politically sensitive events, places and people; and foreign websites and organisations blocked at network level, along with pornography etc. According to Freedom House, a US-based NGO, researchers at China Digital Times have reportedly identified over 800 filtered terms, including “Cultural Revolution” and “propaganda department”.\n\nThe site also publishes the \"Grass-Mud Horse Lexicon\", a wiki-based directory of subversive Chinese Internet language. The project is named after the Grass Mud Horse, whose name sounds similar to “fuck your mother” in Chinese (cǎonímǎ 草泥马), and which is one of the Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures.\n\nChina Digital Times has maintained ongoing coverage of the government clampdown on Chinese internet users – which includes imposing penalties of up to three years in prison for posting 'rumours' shared more than 500 times, or viewed by more than 5,000 people. The publication has also covered the backlash against increased censorship from China's independent media, and employees of state media.\n\nSamuel Wade at China Digital Times observes that, among American internet companies, Wikipedia is almost alone in defying Chinese self-censorship demands.\n\nThe China Digital Times website has been blocked in mainland China since 2006 and in response, Xiao launched a Chinese-language site in 2011. That site has since also been blocked, but numerous methods are used to ensure the site remains accessible in China – including email lists, social media and mirror sites.\n\nA popular section on the site is ‘Minitrue’, which is short for ‘Ministry of Truth’, a reference to the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". It makes a point of highlighting official government directives to media organisations, requiring them to censor or remove postings on sensitive matters. Conversely, if a particular news event is favourable to the government, a directive will sometimes be issued that insists that this be \"prominently displayed\" on the home pages of online news sites.\n\nIn response to calls for a “Jasmine Revolution”, China has tracked and detained online activists; and routinely blocked services including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and LinkedIn. At times, Virtual Private Networks, which are used to circumvent controls, have experienced blockages. Google has also accused China of blocking its Gmail service.\n\nThe website was started by Xiao Qiang at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley in the fall of 2003. Xiao has asserted that Chinese internet users are using digital tools to create new autonomous forms of political expression and dissent, “changing the rules of the game between state and society”.\n\nAn astrophysicist by training, Xiao has been affiliated with the university since 2003, as an adjunct professor both in the Graduate School of Journalism (2003–2011) and the School of Information (2012–present). He became a human rights activist in response to the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and was executive director of the organization Human Rights in China from 1991 to 2002.\nXiao says that “the role of the Internet as a communications tool is especially meaningful in China, where citizens previously had little to no opportunity for unconstrained public self-expression or access to free and uncensored information…”\n\nSophie Beach is the Executive Editor of its English site, and her writing about China has been published in a number of publications including the \"Los Angeles Times\", the \"Asian Wall Street Journal\", the \"South China Morning Post\" and \"The Nation\" magazine.

One of the main theorists of Polish Romanticism. He joined the November Uprising in 1830 taking part in several battles for example at Stoczek, Ostrołęka, Grochów and Wawer. For that activity he was promoted to officer rank and awarded the War Order of Virtuti Militari, which is the highest Polish military decoration.\n\nMaurycy Mochnacki was born in a part of Poland annexed by Russian, where people were tired with everyday brutality, censorship, arrests and imprisonments. They dreamed of a free independent country and cultivated their own tradition, customs and the inner spiritual life. Mochnacki came from a patriotic and political active family. Mochnacki's father - lawyer, land-owner and participant of the Kościuszko Insurrecton in 1794, wanted to give his children the best education. At the beginning, Maurycy learned classical and contemporary literature, history and foreign languages at home. In 1815, the family moved to Lviv, where he took music classes and also played the piano and the violin. In 1819, the family settled down in the town of Czersk near Warsaw. First, Maurycy studied in a prestigious high school in Warsaw then, he started law studies at Warsaw University, but was expelled very soon for striking a policeman who requested him to extinguish his pipe. In a further blow to the family's reputation, he was sentenced to 14 days hard labour, working with criminal offenders in the Belvedere Park. At the end of 1823, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Carmelite Convent for belonging to a secret organization called ‘the Union of Free Polish Brothers’. To get the freedom, he had to write a memorial in which he accused the education system in the Congress Kingdom of early political education for young people and disastrous liberalism. Shortly after his release, he was forced to work at censorship office but lost the job after six months. Those episodes would have a profound influence on his future life.\n\nA legal career now impossible, Maurycy Mochnacki concentrated on art and political activity. His family flat in Warsaw became a meeting place for Polish patriots, writers and musicians, such as Fryderyk Chopin or Maria Szymanowska. Mochnacki was considered a fine pianist but preferred writing essays on Mozart, Beethoven or Weber to performing. At the time he started writing an essay titled 'On the Spirit and the Sources of poetry in Poland', in which he argued that a national literature could only grow from Romantic roots. He also believed that Polish literature should not be a copy of French or German models; instead, writers would have to find Polish version of Romanticism, rooted in national tradition, history and spirit. Mochnacki had a strong influence on the birth of modern literary criticism in Poland. He noted the connection between literary criticism, philosophy and aesthetics. He introduced philosophical notion, for example Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's, into literary criticism. He wrote about novels and poetry of great Polish Romantic writers such as Adam Mickiewicz. Mochnacki thought that literature played a major role in society and was capable of changing people`s thinking, and also it could play a role in creating a new country.\n\nMochnacki worked in several magazines. From 1827 till 1829 he was an editor at Kurier Polski where he criticized established writers. In 1830 he took part in preparations for the November Uprising against Russian rule in Poland. During the November Uprising he set up a political club, called the Patriotic Society and Mochnacki once again was imprisoned for being against an insurrection's dictator Józef Chłopicki. At the same time he studied German philosophy, especially books by Schlegel and Schiller. He thought that literature was more than just an artistic pursuit, it had a mission and a real influence on the political situation. \n\nIn 1831 he fought in number of battles and was wounded. He was promoted to an officer's rank and awarded Poland`s highest military order – the Virtuti Militari medal. After the fall of the uprising he emigrated with his brother to France where he died in 1834.\n\n\n"}

The party was part of the DOS government from 2001 until 20 November 2002 when it froze its participation following a vote by the DOS against starting a parliamentary debate concerning Serbia's independence from Serbia and Montenegro. It advocated a referendum on the issue following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. A petition asking for the referendum collected 400,000 signatures.\n\nThe DHSS was opposed to the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro citing the differences between the two republics' monetary, financial and banking systems, and advocated the dissolution of the federation. It strongly advocated voting in the 2001 Kosovan election, in which it supported the \"Return\" coalition.\n\nIn the 2003 election, the DHSS was part of the Independent Serbia coalition which won no seats.\n\nIn the 2007 election, DHSS president Vladan Batić was listed on the Liberal Democratic Party electoral list and won one seat.\n\nIn the 2008 election, the DHSS went in coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Union, and won one seat, awarded to Vladan Batić. However, on 10 November 2008 Batić left the LDP parliamentary group and from then on voted as an independent MP. The split occurred because the LDP had recently joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and couldn't go on in coalition with a conservative party. At that time, the DHSS was also interested in joining the European People's Party.\n\nAfter the death of Vladan Batić on 29 December 2010 the leadership of the party was transferred to his daughter Olgica Batić according to his wish. She was officially elected leader on 3 September 2011.\n\nIn the 2012 parliamentary election, the DHSS was part of the Choice for a Better Life coalition centered around the Democratic Party and won one seat in the National Assembly of Serbia. The sole MP was Olgica Batić.\n\nIn the 2014 parliamentary election, the DHSS went in coalition with the Serbian Renewal Movement, which was in turn part of the Future We Believe In coalition centered around the Serbian Progressive Party. The DHSS won one seat and its sole MP was Olgica Batić.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, the DHSS merged into the Movement for the Restoration of the Kingdom of Serbia (POKS). Party president Olgica Batić stated full support for the Movement's primary goals - traditional values, preserving the family, the fight for Serbian farmers and the full membership of Serbia in the European Union.\n\n"}

{"id": "2032808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032808", "title": "Aché", "text": "Aché\n\nThe Aché ( ) are an indigenous people of Paraguay. They are hunter-gatherers living in eastern Paraguay.\n\nFrom the earliest Jesuit accounts of the Aché in the 17th century until their peaceful outside contacts in the 20th century, the Aché were described as nomadic hunter-gatherers living in small bands and depending entirely on wild forest resources for subsistence. In the 20th century, four different ethnolinguistic populations of Aché were contacted and pacified. They are the Northern Aché, the Yvytyruzu Aché, the Ypety Aché, and the Ñacunday Aché. Each of these populations was an endogamous dialectal group, consisting of multiple residential bands, with no peaceful interaction between the groups.\n\nThe Aché suffered repeated abuses by rural Paraguayan colonists, ranchers, and big landowners from the conquest period until the latter half of the 20th century. In the 20th century, largely under military dictator \nAlfredo Stroessner, the Northern Aché, who had been the only inhabitants of nearly 20,000 square kilometers of rural Paraguay, ended up confined on just two reservations totaling little more than 50 square kilometers of titled land. In the process, they were massacred, enslaved, and gathered onto reservations where no adequate medical treatment was provided. This process was specifically carried out to pacify them, and to remove them from their ancestral homeland, so that absentee investors (mainly Brazilian) could move in and develop the lands that once belonged only to the Aché. Large multinational business groups—e.g. La Industrial Paraguaya. S.A. (LIPSA)—obtained title rights to already occupied lands and then sold them sight unseen to investors, who purchased lands where Aché bands had roamed for thousands of years, and were still present. The fact that Aché inhabitants were present and living in the forests of Canindeyu and Alto Paraná on the very lands being titled in Hernandarias seems to have been dismissed by cities such as Coronel Oviedo.\n\nThe Kuetuvy Aché were forcibly removed from the Mbaracayu region in the 1970s, but managed to return to their ancestral homeland in 2000.\n\nThe Aché are also known as the Axe people. In the past they have been called the Guaiaqui, Guayakí, Guayaki-Ache, and Guoyagui by Guaraní-speaking neighbors and by early anthropologists, however, these terms are now considered derogatory.\n\nThe earliest published reports (Lozano 1873-74 summary of Jesuit accounts in the 17th century) about the Aché refer to them as \"Guajagui\", a term based on the Guaraní root \"Guaja\" (= enemy tribe, or brother-in-law) and \"gui\" a common Aché suffix (meaning \"essence of\" or \"having the property of\").\n\nThe Aché language provides clues to their origin. Current analysis suggests that it is a Tupí-Guaraní lexicon, overlaid on a unique grammar structure not found in sister Guaraní languages.\n\nGenetic analyses suggest that the Aché are a group of mixed biological origin containing about 60-65% Tupí-Guaraní genes, and 35-40% of genes with affinities to the Macro-Ge (also known as Jé) language family.\n\nThe Aché are also culturally and biologically distinct from the neighboring Guarani. Early descriptions of the Aché emphasized their white skin, light eye and hair color, beards, and Asiatic features as identifying characteristics. Their subsistence practices and technology were considered extremely simple, and nomadism made them secretive and evasive.\n\nThe first archeological evidence of native peoples in Paraguay is represented by the \"Altoparanense industry\" of stone flaked tools found along the Paraná River, and Celt-type stone axes similar to those still used by the Aché of the same region (and dated to about 9,000 Before Present). About 500 CE Guarani horticulturists migrated into the area and began to persecute the Aché hunting peoples, perhaps causing them to move into forested hills, away from open country and navigable rivers, and adopt a more nomadic lifestyle.\n\nWritten history relevant to the Aché begins with the founding of Asunción in 1524. A few years later, in 1554, a small village (Guaira) was founded by the Spanish on the Parana river near the site of modern-day Guaira, Brazil. Fr. Luis de Bolaños arrived in Paraguay 1575, mastered the Guarani language and founded 18 Guarani villages in the province of Guaira between 1580 and 1593. Evidence of groups in Eastern Paraguay, that might have been Aché, comes from the earliest Jesuit archives around 1620. Non-Guarani groups that lived from hunting and gathering were often referred to as Caaygua or Caigua (Kaingang groups from the Southern Je language family). Descriptions of some Caaigua match fairly well with 20th-century descriptions of the Aché. For example, Techo (1897) describes them as hunter-gatherers who ate only palm pith and fruits, venison and roots, and fastened little stones to their lips, which made them look ferocious, and he states that they worshipped only thunder. This is congruous with the Aché, whose economy is indeed based on palm pith and meat, and whose spiritual beliefs place \"Berendy\" (associated with booming meteors) in a central position. Lozano (1873) provides a seven-page early description of the Aché (whom he called \"Guayagui\"), using a summary of Jesuit archives from the 17th century. This description includes accurate information about the Aché economy, social organization, culture and belief system. Lozano and Techo also described how some Aché bands were captured near the mouth of the Acaray river in the 1630s, and forcibly brought to a Guarani Mission. That group of Aché captives all perished from disease within a few months.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, there is no further information about the Aché until the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, when several writers related the knowledge of local Paraguayan populations concerning the Aché, but none observed them directly. These included reports by several foreign scientists as well as the renowned Paraguayan naturalist Moises Bertoni (whose information about the Aché was published posthumously). Finally, a German immigrant, Federico Maynthusen contacted a group of Aché in 1908, in the modern department of Itapua, and published information on both their language and culture.\n\nIn 1959, after decades of persecution, the Ypety Aché were contacted in modern-day Caazapa and pacified by Manuel de Jesus Pereira. Pereira then used Ypety Aché guides to track down, contact and pacify the Yvytyruzu Aché in the Guairá Department in 1963. Both groups together numbered only about 100 individuals when contacted. Between 1963 and 1968 more than half of the Aché that had been recently pacified perished from disease while under Pereira's supervision. During this time, the Ypety and Yvytyruzu Aché were studied and described by anthropologists Branislava Susnik, Leon Cadogan, and Pierre Clastres.\n\nBy the 1960s the Northern Aché were the last large uncontacted ethnic group in Paraguay, but they were constantly persecuted by colonists, loggers, and ranchers. Paraguay, like other Latin American countries, had a long colonial history of Indian enslavement that continued well after the official prohibition of slavery in 1869. Aché bands were systematically raided with the intention of killing the men, and capturing the women and children. Aché children were sold openly in the region as late as the 1970s. The \"pacification\" of the Northern Aché has been labeled as genocide by some writers (e.g., Munzel 1973, 1974, 1976). On 8 April 2014, the Aché presented a complaint of genocide against their people during the military government of Alfredo Stroessner in an Argentinian court.\n\nBecause of increasing hostile encounters with Northern Aché during the construction of the new Saltos de Guaira road in the mid-1960s, Manuel Pereira moved with the Ypety and Yvytyruzu Aché to a site called \"Cerro Moroti\", in modern Caaguazú District, in order to track down and pacify the Northern Aché. At that time the Northern Aché still ranged free over a huge region from San Joaquin mountains to the Paraná River, and from the Acaray River north to the Mbaracayu Mountains, and there were approximately 560 individuals in the population. Pereira was encouraged to pacify this group and remove them from the area.\n\nIn October 1970, several Aché from the Cerro Moroti reservation were attacked while hunting. They routed their attackers using newly acquired shotguns, and captured a Northern Aché woman who was taken back to Cerro Moroti. Within a month the captured Northern Aché woman led Pereira's reservation Aché to her forest band, and the group was persuaded to move to the Cerro Moroti reservation in order to receive protection from \"Papa Pereira\". This \"surrender\" was accomplished peacefully because many of the Yvytyruzu Aché living at Cerro Moroti had known and were related to members of this Northern Aché band (the two groups had only been separated in the late 1930s when the road to Ciudad del Este was constructed).\n\nBetween 1971 and 1978, at least ten different contact and extraction events of forest-dwelling Northern Aché took place. A high percentage of those taken to the Cerro Moroti government sponsored reservation (named officially the \"Colonia Nacional Guayaki\") died from respiratory epidemics within two years after first peaceful contact. In addition, several large bands fled from contact and suffered almost total mortality in the forest. Detailed demographic data on the Northern Aché population (based on extensive interviews with survivors) shows that 38% of the population died from contact related respiratory disease during this time period. This included 68 individuals who ran away from contact and died in the forest, 131 individuals who died at reservation/mission settlements between 1971 and 1978, and 49 individuals that were kidnapped by Paraguayans during the contact process and never seen again (Hill and Hurtado 1996).\n\nThe post-contact history of the Northern Aché begins with chaos at Cerro Moroti following the arrest of Manuel Pereira, and the newly appointed administration of the New Tribes missionaries in September 1972. Small groups left the reservation almost every day and dispersed along the new road from Santa Rosa Cue to the Carapa river. Many joined Pereira after his release for a short time at Ybyrycua, and then left again. Some re-entered the forest, and many were persuaded or coerced to stay on as laborers in small Paraguayan settlements and isolated rural houses.\n\nThe situation changed dramatically in 1974-75, when Father Nicolas de Cunha began to systematically bring the surviving Aché refugees to the Catholic Mission San Agustín. This settlement began on the Carapa River, but then moved to borrowed land on Arroyo Manduvi near Laurel, Alto Paraná. The Manduvi group was under the direction of Padre Alejandro Pytel, and in 1978, after Padre de Cunha died suddenly, Pytel convinced the Verbo Divino order to purchase new land for a permanent mission. The entire Manduvi group moved to a new mission, located at Chupa Pou in August 1978.\n\nFor the next 20 years, the Chupa Pou mission grew into the largest Aché settlement in Paraguay, while the Colonia Nacional in Cerro Moroti decreased in size, lost most of its original land holdings, and increasingly intermixed and intermarried with the neighboring Paraguayans.\n\nFollowing the original dispersal from Cerro Moroti, several more Aché communities were formed over the next 25 years. First, in 1976, the missionary family of Rolf Fostervold contacted and protected the Ynaro/Ñacunday Aché that were on the verge of extermination. This settlement, called Puerto Barra, was located at the confluence of the Ynaro and Nacunday rivers at an old sawmill. Then, soon afterwards, a group of Southern Aché and their affines and associates left Cerro Moroti to found a new colony near the traditional home range of the Ypety Aché. This settlement, located in the state of Caazapa, is referred to as Ypetymi (also Tupa Renda).\n\nNext, in the early 1980s a dozen families from the Chupa Pou reservation left to join the Aché band that had been contacted in the Refugio Mbaracayú (Mbaracayu Biological Sanctuary) in April 1978, and was living at a German Mission for Guarani Indians. The Aché separated from the Guarani, and formed the community now called Arroyo Bandera, at the edge of the Mbaracayu Forest Reserve.\n\nFinally, twenty years after its formation, the Chupa Pou community fissioned, resulting in the colony now called \"Kue Tuvy\".\n\nCurrently there are six legally recognized Aché communities: Cerro Moroti; Ypetimi, Puerto Barra; Chupa Pou; Kuetuvy; and Arroyo Bandera. The Chupa Pou reservation is the largest of these and also the main center of the Northern Aché sub-group. The Chupa Pou Aché consist of approximately 80 families residing south of Villa Ygatimi along the Jejui Guasu river. Arroyo Bandera is located directly west of the main entry to the Mbaracayu Reserve (15 km north of Ygatimi), and had 148 inhabitants (about 30 families) in January 2006. The most recent Northern Aché community is that of Kuetuvy, which had 205 residents (about 55 families) in January 2006, and is located directly south of the Mbaracayu Reserve, on the property designated as \"Finca 470\".\n\nIn 1991 the legal decree creating the Mbaracayu Forest Reserve (MFR) recognized the MFR as the Northern Aché traditional territory and gave the Aché permanent hunting and collecting rights inside the reserve. The Kuetuvy Aché are descendants of bands that were extracted from the MFR, and surrounding regions in 1972-74. This group separated from the Chupa Pou Aché on March 8, 2000 because of disagreements about resource use on the Chupa Pou reservation. In that dispute Kuetuvy leaders chastised the Chupa Pou leaders for selling timber in an uncontrolled fashion and cutting more forest than was necessary for subsistence. The Kuetuvy Aché announced their intention to move back to their traditional homeland (Finca #470) and began the process of soliciting expropriation of the property. They resided just south of the Finca #470 property with the Guarani Indian community of Takua Poty and waited for permission to occupy Finca #470. On December 11, 2000 (resolution 521/00) they received official recognition as a community by the Paraguayan Indigenous Institute (INDI). Then on June 25, 2001 the Kuetuvy community received status as a legally recognized entity in Paraguay (\"personería juridica\" decreto no. 13527)\n\nInitially the Fundacion Moises Bertoni (FMB) intended to purchase Finca #470 from its Taiwanese owner with funds raised in the US, Taiwan, and other foreign countries and then transfer the title of the property to the Kuetuvy Aché as an \"Indigenous Forest Reserve\". In June 2000, Alberto Yanosky, then acting director of the FMB, made a verbal agreement with Kuetuvy leaders as to the conditions under which the FMB would purchase and transfer the property to the Aché. The agreement between Kuetuvy and the FMB included the development of a sustainable management plan and a promise not to cut more than 5% of the forest on the property for residential areas and agriculture. The Aché proposed these conditions and pledged to sign a binding agreement to that effect. The FMB carried out an evaluation of the property and made a purchase offer in late 2000. The Taiwanese property owner accepted the FMB offer to purchase the property on January 15, 2001.\n\nBut, in the months following the initial agreement between the FMB and the Kuetuvy Aché, the Paraguayan Ministry of Public Works (\"Ministerio de Obras Públicas\") and the Secretary of the Environment (Secretaría del Ambiente) began negotiating independently with the property owner to purchase Finca #470 as part of a conservation land quota required by the Interamerican Development Bank (\"Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo\" – BID) in order to meet conditions for a BID loan for the route 10 project in Canindeyu. During that negotiation the owner of Finca #470 notified the FMB that he was no longer interested in selling the property to any NGO. When the Kuetuvy leaders discovered that the Paraguayan government intended to purchase the property as part of a conservation easement plan, they immediately presented a formal \"request\" for expropriation to the Paraguayan National Indian Institute (INDI) and the Secretary of Environment (SEAM).\n\nIn January 2001 clandestine loggers working for Brazilian sawmills began a massive invasion of Finca #470 aided by \"landless peasants\" who promised to protect them if they cleared roads and allowed for subsequent settlement on the property. The loggers were evicted in December 2001 and the landless peasants were permanently removed in July 2002 after armed Aché warriors patrolled the southern boundary of the territory.\n\nBetween July 2001 and late 2003 Aché leaders attended dozens of meetings with representatives of Paraguayan government agencies (INDI, SEAM, Oficina de la Procuradoría de la Nación) and NGO's (Fundacion Moises Bertoni, World Wildlife Fund, Avina, PROSAM) interested in supporting their claim to Finca #470. All representatives of both government agencies and NGOs assured the Aché that the land would be titled to them once expropriated by the Paraguayan government. In early January 2002 the Aché received a letter of permission to occupy Finca #470 from the Secretary of the Environment, and the Kuetuvy Aché permanently settled the property on January 8, 2002.\n\nIn June 2002, the Aché began systematic conservation work on the Finca #470. An Aché resource management team trained by Kim Hill performed partial forest inventory and animal density counts on Finca #470 using random transect methodology. During that month the Aché management team also did two aerial overflights of the property with GPS receivers and detailed maps.\n\nDuring June–July 2002 there was a second attempted invasion of the property by so-called \"landless peasants\". Aché leaders called the national press, several government officials, and organized a show of armed resistance which was attended by representatives of all six Aché reservations. Over 200 armed (with bow and arrow) warriors stood along the border of the property near the campsite of the would-be peasant invaders.\n\nOn July 24, 2003 the political leaders of Kuetuvy gathered their community and all adult members signed a document requesting INDI to obtain legal title to the Finca 470 property from SEAM and transfer the title to the Aché community. On Feb 10, 2004 religious and political leaders from Kuetuvy met directly with President Nicanor Duarte Frutos at \"Mburuvicha Roga\" and were assured by the Paraguayan President that they would receive title to Finca #470.\n\nThe Aché indicated that they would manage the property as an \"Indigenous Reserve\" and requested technical assistance in order to develop a sustainable management plan. They proposed to conserve a large area of forest where activities would include sustainable hunting, collection of edible fruits and insects, collection of medicinal plants, enrichment of the forest with commercially valuable native tree species such as Yerba Mate, and minimal impact forestry based on long cycle rotation and low-impact harvest and transport. The forestry-based products would be primarily destined for internal consumption in the form of houses, school buildings, clinics, etc. The Secretary of Environment (SEAM) responded with support for the Aché proposal and signed an Agreement of Inter-institutional Cooperation for five years with the Paraguayan Indian Institute (INDI) and the Aché leaders on September 2, 2004.\n\nThe first clause of the agreement states that \"… the purpose of this agreement is to cede temporary use rights of the SEAM property called Finca 470, in the District of Ygatimi, Department of Canindeyú, to INDI with the ultimate intention that the Aché Indigenous Community of Kuetuvy can continue their customary subsistence activities, in agreement with principles of nature conservation. This is done, taking into account that the Finca 470, object of this agreement, is a forestry reserve of biological and botanical resources, considered part of the 'lungs' of the Atlantic Interior Forest, and located inside the buffer zone of the Mbaracayu Forest Reserve. In this way we hope to establish mechanisms to guarantee the joint process of transferring land rights of the Finca 470 to the native peoples located in that place, and in observance with the National Constitution and laws 352/94, 904/94, and 234/93\".\n\nIn March 2005 the Aché presented a management plan for Finca 470 to SEAM and on May 3, 2005 the Secretary of the Environment responded to the leader of the Aché community, Margarita Mbywangi in note 291/05.\n\nThat document from SEAM expressed agreement with the terms of the Aché management plan of March 29, 2005 (stamped as received by the SEAM document #33084). SEAM agreed to: first, accept the regional management plan presented by the Aché community; and second, initiate the process of transfer of title from the SEAM to the Aché Community Kuetuvy, which had been solicited by request to SEAM on April 28, 2005 in note #34128. In this fashion, SEAM indicated that the necessary steps were being planned taking into account that the process must comply with certain regulations in order to legally cede title to the community. Soon afterwards, on August 19, 2005 the Secretary of the Environment sent a document (note #563/05) directed to the President of the Republic in reference to the Finca 470, situated in the District of Ygatimi, Department of Canindeyú. This letter stated that the aforementioned property \"..was acquired by the Secretary of the Environment for conservation purposes in the area of influence of National Highway 10 \"Las Residentas\" through the loan number 933/OC-PR from the International Development Bank within the framework of the \"Natural Corridors\" program of the Public Works and Communications Ministry, as stated in the transfer of title document registered by the Escribanía Mayor de Gobierno in 2003, under the registry n° 30 archive 195 and those that follow.\" \n\nThe document sent to the President of the Republic goes on to repeat SEAM's commitment to the terms of the 2004 Interinstitutional Cooperation Agreement with the ultimate goal of maintaining a forest reserve and transferring title to the indigenous inhabitants of the property in observance with the National Constitution and aforementioned laws N° 352/94, N° 904/94, N° 234/93. Continuing, the document states that \".. taking into account that the aforementioned property functions as permanent location of the native Aché community Kuetuvy, and according to the principles of national law 234/93, which endorses article 14 of ILO Convention 169 (this refers to the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 formulated by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations) stating that \"The rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall be recognised.\", in my position as Secretary of the Environment I am submitting the background concerning this case to the Presidencia de la República, in order that the corresponding necessary steps be taken by the appropriate entities, in order that we comply with the first clause in the framework of the mentioned International Convention.\"\n\nThe request for executive action on the Kue Tuvy land title was submitted again to the President on March 6, 2006 (SEAM note 177/06) by the Secretary of the Environment, Alfredo Molinas. In summary, the Secretary of the Environment twice directly solicited the office of the President to carry out the administrative processes necessary in order that the Escribanía Mayor de Gobierno, the Paraguayan Indian Institute, and the Indigenous Aché Community all work together to guarantee success in the process of transferring the title of Finca 470 to the Aché Community of Kuetuvy. Despite this request in August 2005, and again in March 2006, no significant steps have been taken to further the land titling process since that time. Instead the Aché have fought and endless battles against illegal loggers, speculators, and so-called \"landless peasants\". Margarita Mbywangi, the chief of the Kuetuvy community was arrested and imprisoned in Curuguaty in December 2005 along with members of the forestry patrol team who had tried to stop illegal loggers from extracting valuable hardwood trees from the property.\n\nOn August 18, 2008, Paraguayan president Fernando Lugo appointed Margarita Mbywangi, an Aché woman, to be the Paraguayan Minister of Indigenous Affairs, the first indigenous person to hold such a position in Paraguay.\n\nAlthough early reports locate Aché-like groups throughout eastern Paraguay and the adjacent areas of Brazil, by the 20th century the Aché lived in four dialectally distinct groups that inhabited the Paraná River watershed in the modern day Paraguayan states of Caazapa, Guairá, Alto Paraná, Caaguazu, and Canindeyu. The Northern Aché, who are the best documented, ranged from the forests near Coronel Oviedo, to the Paraná River near Saltos de Guaira, a home range of approximately 20,000 square kilometers.\n\nEastern Paraguay is characterized by gently rolling hills covered with subtropical, semideciduous forest, and low flat valleys filled with tall grasses. Rainfall totals about 2000 mm per year on average, and is characterized by high unpredictability in monthly patterns from year-to-year, but with a statistical dry season from May to August. Seasonal temperature fluctuations are more consistent, with temperature extremes ranging between 39 and 0 degrees Celsius. Eastern Paraguay contains regions of mature terra firme tropical forest, cerrado, grassland, palm-dominated swamps, bamboo forests, riparian flood forests, and a low drier forest type referred to as \"kaati\" by Guarani speakers. Although the region is an important endemic bird habitat, with over 400 species of birds recorded in the past few years, mammals are far more important in the Aché culture and economy. A provisional list of the mammalian fauna in the MFR includes 99 species of mammals identified by various methods.\n\nThe Aché economy was traditionally centered on hunting vertebrate game with bow and arrow, extracting wild honey, and exploiting palm starch and insect larvae. Numerous fruits were also exploited seasonally, but they constitute only a small fraction of the energy in the yearly diet. In the last half century before pacification, Aché groups occasionally raided their settled neighbors for manioc root (a starchy staple), domestic animals, and metal tools.\n\nSystematic recording of dietary intake while living in the forest entirely off wild foods suggests that about 80% of the energy in the diet comes from meat, 10% from palm starch and hearts, 10% from insect larva and honey, and 1% from fruits. Total energy intake is approximately 2700 kcal per person daily, and males acquire about 84% of all calories consumed. Children do not produce significant amounts of food until they are fully adult. Despite the presence of over 500 species of edible vertebrate prey, only nine species of mammals provide more than 1% of the prey biomass actually harvested by Aché hunters. Most important (in descending order) are nine-banded armadillo, paca, South American tapir, capuchin monkey, white-lipped peccary, South American coati, red brocket, and tegu lizards.\n\nAché men hunt with bow and arrow, and by hand. They leave camp each morning as a group, walking in single file line, and after about a half-hour, they begin to spread out and search for game. Men stay within earshot of each other throughout the day, to call for assistance if cooperatively pursued prey are encountered. While searching, a hunter walks at a rate of about 1.5 km/h and encounters the most common prey, armadillo, about once every 5 km on average. Monkeys and deer are encountered about 1/3 as frequently as armadillos, and other prey types are considerably more rare in the environment. Armadillos, collared peccaries, deer, tegu lizards, tapir, and most other rare but solitary animals are stalked and pursued alone by bow hunters when encountered. Other species such as paca, monkeys, coatimundi, white-lipped peccaries, and social mammals are usually cooperatively pursued by groups, and encounters with these species usually induce men to call to others for help.\n\nLarge and swift mammals are stalked and shot with bow and arrow. Smaller and burrowing mammals are usually captured by hand. Because Aché hunting has been extensively studied using focal follow and other systematic methods, the encounter rates with prey, the time required for a successful pursuit, and the expected energy gains from prey types, are all well known. This has allowed for numerous tests of specific decision models from Optimal Foraging Theory to be tested using Aché data. Results generally support the notion that Aché hunters pursue only those prey types that would increase their energy return rates, and pass by some species (many small birds, rodents, reptiles, etc.) that would probably lower overall foraging returns if pursued.\n\nThe question of why men hunt, rather than spend all day extracting palm resources, cannot be explained by energy maximization, since men obtain about 750 calories per hour hunting, and around 1,000 calories per hour extracting palm starch and hearts. Hill has suggested that the macronutrient content of meat, relative to plants, means that meat is worth more nutritionally than equivalent caloric amounts of palm starch. Hawkes on the other hand, has suggested that Aché men hunt because hunting is a form of costly signaling, rather than exclusively a manner to provision hungry family members.\n\nCollected resources include mainly palm hearts and starch, insect larva extracted from palm trees felled to encourage infestation, wild honey, and various fruits that ripen mainly in summer months, between October and February. Two non-native species are now dispersed throughout the forests of Eastern Paraguay and contribute significantly to the diet: These are honeybees of European origin (\"Apis mellifera\"), and volunteer oranges which were introduced by the Jesuits, and subsequently dispersed through the forest by birds and monkeys.\n\nDespite the plant diversity and dietary variety introduced by the various collected species, only palm hearts, starch, and bee honey contribute significant energy to the Aché diet. Palm starch is the most important carbohydrate staple in the Aché diet. Palm trees are cut, then a small \"window\" is cut in the trunk to test out the inner pith, which when edible is soft and juicy with a high concentration of starch. The growing shoot (heart) is extracted from each cut palm, but this resource has a high water content and provides only a small caloric contribution to the diet.\n\nWhen a trunk with good starch is discovered, one or more women will open up most of the trunk from base to top of the tree and systematically pound the fiber with the back of an axe to loosen it up and soften it. Large amounts (15–50 kg) are then transported back to the camp in baskets for further processing. At camp the palm fiber is dipped handful by handful into a pot full of water and wrung out by hand to extract all the starch. The pot of water containing the starch is then used to boil meat or insect larva. This mixture will be eaten hot (as a thick gravy broth) or allowed to cool overnight, which hardens it into a pudding.\n\nAlthough random transects show a high density of palms in the Mbaracayú region of Paraguay, most of these do not contain starch. Recent work shows that it takes about 15 minutes to find a candidate palm to cut down and then only one out of 8 trees cut has any starch. Thus, by spending a few hours searching for, and exploiting palms, Aché foragers can acquire carbohydrate energy at a rate of just over 1,000 calories per hour.\n\nDuring food acquisition, Aché foragers are frequently observed engaging in activities that require some time or effort and appear mainly designed to raise the foraging return rate of another adult or unrelated child: cooperative foraging. The data suggest that foraging cooperation is widespread and intense, accounting for a good fraction of total foraging time, and including a high number of potentially costly acts that are performed daily. Cooperation also includes some actions that are not very costly to the donor, but which are highly beneficial to the recipient. Most importantly, the cooperative patterns observed during food acquisition are almost certainly related to the well studied Aché food sharing patterns. Reciprocation of foraging cooperation takes place in the form of food redistribution. Finally, cooperation during food acquisition represents only a fraction of total cooperative activity in Aché society. Indeed, cooperative food acquisition, food sharing, and cooperation in other realms (such as child rearing, mobility, camp construction, defense, etc.) are all part of an integrated system of reciprocal altruism and cooperative promotion of group welfare among the Aché.\n\nCooperative activities during foraging time included the following: cutting trails for others to follow; making bridges for others to cross a river; carrying another's child; climbing a tree to flush a monkey for another hunter; allowing another to shoot at prey when one has the first (or best) shot; allowing another to dig armadillo, or to extract honey or larva when one has encountered it; yelling the whereabouts of prey escaping; calling the location of a resource for another individual to exploit while one continues searching; calling another to come to a pursuit of peccary, paca, monkey, or coati; waiting for others to join a pursuit, thus lowering one's own return rate; tracking peccaries with no arrows (for other men with arrows to kill); carrying game shot by another hunter; climbing fruit trees to knock down fruit for others to collect; cutting down palms (for others to take heart or fiber); opening a window to test for kraku (for others to come take); carrying the palm fiber others have taken; cutting down fruit trees for others to collect; bringing a bow, arrow, ax or other tool to another in a pursuit; spending time instructing another on how to take a resource; lending a bow or ax when it could be used; helping to look for another's arrows; preparing or repairing another man's bow and arrows in the middle of a pursuit; going back on the trail to warn others of a wasp nest; walking toward other hunters to warn of fresh jaguar tracks or poisonous snakes; removing dangerous obstacles from the trail before others arrive.\n\nThe estimate of cooperative time presented below is a minimum estimate, since data were not originally collected with a focus on recording all cooperative activity. Short cooperative activities were especially unlikely to be recorded in field notes. For example, examination of videotapes from hunting episodes during the sample period reveals that very short cooperative activities are frequently embedded into longer hunting segments that we have not coded as cooperative time. While pursuing monkeys, hunters often call to others to \"stay put\", \"don't make noise\", \"don't shoot\", \"shake a branch\", \"pound a vine\" etc. Other multi-hunter pursuits contain numerous similar requests. The recipient of such a command almost always complies immediately, at a cost to his own chances of making the kill. These events were extremely common, but of very short duration (usually only 10 seconds or so) and are not included in the analyses. Aché men spent an average of 41 (s.e. 7) minutes per day in food acquisition activities scored as cooperative, and women spent 33 (s.e. 14) minutes per day cooperating in foraging. This represents about 10% of total foraging time in the men's sample, and 11% of total foraging time in the women's sample. Both sexes show some sample days with more than 50% of total foraging time being spent helping other individuals to acquire resources.\n\nAché foragers living in the forest share food extensively, and animal prey are divided up communally among band members. Social norms proscribe men from eating anything from their own prey, and emphasize the importance of band-wide distributions. In essence, wild game is cooked and redistributed in equal portions to resident families, taking into account the size of each family that receives a portion. This means that successful hunters and their families obtain no more meat from their own captured prey than would be expected by a random distribution to resident families. Palm starch produced in large batches is shared in a manner similar to meat (but with no overt taboo against women consuming some of the starch they have extracted). Honey is somewhat less widely shared, but large portions are saved for members absent at the time of extraction. Collected fruits and insect larva are even less widely shared but are still redistributed to those not present at a collection site. A hunter's nuclear family usually consumes about 10% of the game brought in by the male head of the household. For most other resources the nuclear family of the acquirer keeps less than 50% for their own consumption, but only 10-20% of small collected fruits are shared outside the family. More recent analyses show that high acquisition variance resources are shared more widely, that the amount of most foods shared is contingent on amount received across dyads of potential sharing partners, and that needy families consistently receive more than they give. Reservation food sharing patterns show that people who are more generous are more likely to receive help and support when they become sick or injured.\n\nAché foragers in the pre-contact period lived in small bands ranging from 3-4 families to a couple dozen families (median band size is approximately 50 individuals). But these residential units often subdivided for a few days, and occasionally coalesced into large gatherings, thus the composition of reported bands in systematic interviews ranges from 3 to 160 individuals. During club-fighting rituals, three or four bands might unite, resulting in temporary camps of 200 or more individuals that might camp together for 5–15 days before dispersal. More frequently bands of many families would break up into temporary task groups that would leave children and older band members in a permanent camp, while younger adults traveled to distant areas for a few days in search of specific resources that were depleted nearby. On such forays, successful task groups would return to the main camp laden with smoked meat and other goodies.\n\nBand membership was highly flexible over time, and was based as much on affinal ties and friendships as on consanguineal relations. Some small groups of kin (a couple brothers, or brother-sister groups) usually formed the core membership of each band, but composition appears to be highly flexible when assessed over a period of years. Bands did not have territories, but did have favored home ranges from which they strayed only occasionally. Bands were not named, but often referred to by the name of the most influential male member (e.g., Tayjangi-the-killer's band). Aché societies were not organized into any specific kin or ritual groups, and leadership was informal and often context specific. There were no recognized chiefs, nor any other political-religious office. The Aché had no specialist shamans, but older individuals and pregnant women were often involved in healing activities. Decisions were reached through informal consensus, and strong dissent was expressed by abandoning a residential band. Women were involved in most discussions, but some men were clearly politically dominant, and men who had killed (called \"jaychagi\") were especially feared and \"respected\". These killers often sharpened their bowstave at one end to look like a spear point, and threatened others by their demeanor. Children were especially terrified of the killers who made a grand display of noise or growling, bluff and bluster (shaking tree branches and swaggering) when entering a residential camp after a day of hunting.\n\nAché cultural conventions emphasize food sharing, regulated cooperation, group participation in raising and nourishing children, restrained violence, and marriage proscriptions for members of the ethnic group. Behaviors towards outgroup individuals is unregulated. \n\nThe birth of a child introduces a series of lifelong obligations between the child, its parents, and those who take on ritual roles during the birth. The child's mother is helped during labor and later is ritually washed by some of the helpers. The child will be held immediately after birth by a \"godmother\" that is responsible for washing and caring for the infant during the first few days after birth while mother rests. The child and godmother adopt ritual terms for each other, and the child can expect food, help and support from its godmother throughout its life. A man cuts the umbilical cord of the child and becomes the \"godfather\" with similar lifelong obligations. Men who have provided the mother with game during her pregnancy also take on a ritual obligation to the child, and so do all the band members who hold the child and wash it soon after birth. The obligations through the life course are reciprocal such that the child is cared for by ritual \"godparents\" when young and later cares for them in turn when they become elderly. Both biological parents and all the ritual godparents retain lifetime obligations of mutual aid.\n\nWhen a girl reaches menarche, she is held in the lap by adults in a ritual similar to that at birth. She is then partially secluded for some time, being covered with woven palm-leaf mats. After seclusion, she is cut with broken glass, and charcoal is rubbed into the wound to create a set of linear parallel tattoo marks. Men who have had sexual relations with her prior to menarche also undergo ritual purification at this time. Women keep their hair cut short and wear seed and tooth necklaces as tribal ethnic identifiers.\n\nWhen boys begin to show facial hair growth, they too undergo a puberty ritual, which is usually timed to coincide with a birth or female puberty ceremony. Their lower lip is perforated with a sharpened bone, and then a wooden labret is introduced. This adornment is worn only by younger men, but all men retain the perforation in their lip for life. After the lip-piercing ceremony, young men are cut and tattooed in the same fashion described for young women. The man who perforates their lip becomes a ritual godfather. Newly initiated young men usually accompany the ritual godfather for some time, often leaving their own nuclear families behind.\n\nWhen they became too old or too disabled to be productive members of the tribe, Aché women were violently murdered by another man in their tribe. Unproductive elderly Aché men were exiled from the group.\n\nOne of the four groups of Aché is reported to have practiced cannibalism occasionally, possibly as late as the 1960s, and the northern group sometimes euthanized and cremated elderly people thought to harbor dangerous vengeful spirits (possibly advanced dementia, or Alzheimer's).\n\nThe most important northern Aché ritual was the club-fight. These events were organized by \"big men\" and took place once every year or two. Several bands would converge on a single camping area. Those who invited the others would prepare a cleared area in which to do ritual combat. Men prepared long hardwood clubs with sharpened edges (paddle-shaped), and decorated themselves with charcoal (mixed with honey and saliva) and vulture down. Although club fights consisted of hosting and invited teams of men, after the fighting began all men were free to choose opponents from either group. Men faced off and took turns swinging at each other's heads. Some men were hit directly on the top of the head and sustained fractured skulls, that later healed, but with tell-tale signs of combat. Other men dodged the clubs, but might be hit on the arms or shoulders. Some men died in almost every large clubfighting event. Sometimes clubfighting would also emerge spontaneously within a small residential band, when one man was caught having sexual relations with another man's wife. These types of duels were never lethal. In all clubfights, some bystanders (including women) would rush in and try to hamper or disarm men who were in combat with their father, sons or brothers.\n\nAché mythology is centered around Berendy, a flaming thunderous being that at times takes the form of a meteor, and at times has a body of flesh and blood. Berendy's son is the subject of several myths, which also include themes of the origin of jaguars, the sun and the moon, the origins of fire, and some moral tales about stingy old men and old women. Northern Aché emphasized the spiritual powers of a being that manifest itself as both shadow and wind. Southern Aché groups appear to have included a malevolent spirit that originates from the souls of angry deceased Aché. \n\nAll Aché believe in some types of hunting magic, and in the curative powers of pregnant women.\n\nAché demography has been extensively studied and analyzed in the framework of evolutionary life history theory. Major causes of death in the forest period were in-group homicides (especially of infants and children), external warfare, respiratory disease, tropical fevers, and accidents. Over 40% of all adult deaths, and more than 60% of all child deaths, were due to violence by other Aché or by outsiders. In the forest period, about 65% of all children born survived to adulthood (age 15), and life expectancy for those young adults was an additional 40 years on average. Fertility was high, with completed family sizes of post reproductive women being just over 8 live births. Analyses indicate that high return hunters, and large bodied women, had higher lifetime reproductive success than their peers. More detailed information relevant to theories about body size variation, age at menarche, menopause, life history tradeoffs, etc. are presented in Hill and Hurtado's 1996 \"Aché Life History\".\n\n"}

Reductive amination reactions such as this one will not produce quaternary ammonium salts, but instead will stop at the tertiary amine stage. It is named for the German chemist Wilhelm Eschweiler (1860–1936) and the British chemist Hans Thacher Clarke (1887-1972).\n\nThe first methylation of the amine begins with imine formation with formaldehyde. The formic acid acts as a source of hydride and reduces the imine to a secondary amine. The driving force is the formation of the gas carbon dioxide. Formation of the tertiary amine is similar, but slower due to the difficulties in iminium ion formation.\n\nFrom this mechanism it is clear that a quaternary ammonium salt will never form, because it is impossible for a tertiary amine to form another imine or iminium ion.\n\nChiral amines typically do not racemize under these conditions.\n\nAltered versions of this reaction replace formic acid with sodium cyanoborohydride.\n\n"}

It is thus made partly of matter, and partly of antimatter. The atom is electrically neutral, since both electrons and antiprotons each have a charge of −1, whereas helium nuclei have a charge of +2.\n\nThese exotic atoms can be produced by simply mixing antiprotons with ordinary helium gas; the antiproton spontaneously removes one of the two electrons contained in a normal helium atom in a chemical reaction, and then begins to orbit the helium nucleus in the electron's place. This will happen in the case of approximately 3% of the antiprotons introduced to the helium gas. The antiproton's orbit, which has a large principal quantum number and angular momentum quantum number of around 38, lies far away from the surface of the helium nucleus. The antiproton can thus orbit the nucleus for tens of microseconds, before finally falling to its surface and annihilating.\n\nAntiprotonic helium atoms are under study by the ASACUSA experiment at CERN. In these experiments, the atoms are first produced by stopping a beam of antiprotons in helium gas. The atoms are then irradiated by powerful laser beams, which cause the antiprotons in them to resonate and jump from one atomic orbit to another.\n\nBy measuring the particular frequency of the laser light needed to resonate the atom, \nthe ASACUSA experiment determined the mass of the antiproton, which they measured at times more massive than an electron. This is the same as the mass of a \"regular\" proton, within the level of certainty of the experiment.\nThis is a confirmation of a fundamental symmetry of nature called CPT (short for charge, parity, and time reversal). This law says that all physical laws would remain unchanged under simultaneous reversal of the charge axis, parity of the space axes, and the orientation of the time axis. One important prediction of this theory is that particles and their antiparticles should have exactly the same mass.\n\nBy comparing the above results on laser spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium with separate high-precision measurements of the antiproton's cyclotron frequency carried out by the ATRAP and BASE collaborations at CERN, the mass and electric charge of the antiproton can be precisely compared with the proton values. The most recent such measurements show that the antiproton's mass (and the absolute value of the charge) is the same as the proton's to a precision of 0.5 parts in a billion.\n\nAn antiprotonic helium ion is a two-body object composed of a helium nucleus and orbiting antiproton. It has an electric charge of +1. Cold ions with lifetimes of up to 100 ns were produced by the ASACUSA experiment in 2005.\n\n\n"}

It is often a noted location due to the sheer number of educational facilities it holds, while lying in a zone between the Central Area and near industrial zone in the vicinity of Jurong.\n\nThe Dover neighbourhood was formerly a British military and residential area. Hence, many road names in the area are derived from English (specifically Kentish) place names. For example, those in Medway Park off Dover Road include names associated with the southern coastal areas of England, including Folkestone and Maidstone, apart from Dover itself. The name \"Dover\" is from the Celtic word meaning \"The Waters\", alluding to the English Channel. Medway Park, for instance, is named after the River Medway, which marks the middle of Kent.

He served as President George W. Bush's chief speechwriter from 2001 until June 2006, as a senior policy advisor from 2000 through June 2006, and was a member of the White House Iraq Group.\n\nHe helped write the inaugural address for the second inauguration of George W. Bush, which called for neo-conservative intervention and nation-building around the world to effect the spread of democracy to third world countries.\n\nIn 2018, Gerson and commentator Amy Holmes co-hosted \"In Principle\", a politically conservative-oriented television talk show that ran for eight episodes on PBS.\n\nGerson was raised in an Evangelical Christian family in St. Louis, Missouri. He attending Westminster Christian Academy for high school. His paternal grandfather was Jewish. He attended Georgetown University for a year and then transferred to Wheaton College in Illinois, graduating in 1986.\n\nBefore joining the Bush Administration, he was a senior policy advisor with The Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy research institution. He also worked at various times as an aide to Indiana Senator Dan Coats and a speechwriter for the Presidential campaign of Bob Dole before briefly leaving the political world to cover it as a journalist for \"U.S. News & World Report\". Gerson also worked at one point as a ghostwriter for Charles Colson.\n\nIn early 1999, Karl Rove recruited Gerson for the Bush campaign.\n\nGerson was named by \"Time\" as one of \"The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals In America.\" The February 7, 2005 issue listed Gerson as the ninth most influential.\n\nGerson joined the Bush campaign before 2000 as a speechwriter and went on to head the White House speechwriting team. \"No one doubts that he did his job exceptionally well,\" wrote Ramesh Ponnuru in a 2007 article otherwise very critical of Gerson in \"National Review\". According to Ponnuru, Bush's speechwriters had more prominence in the administration than their predecessors did under previous presidents because Bush's speeches did most of the work of defending the president's policies, since administration spokesmen and press conferences did not. On the other hand, he wrote, the speeches would announce new policies that were never implemented, making the speechwriting in some ways less influential than ever.\n\nOn June 14, 2006, it was announced that Gerson was leaving the White House to pursue other writing and policy work. He was replaced as Bush's chief speechwriter by \"The Wall Street Journal\" chief editor William McGurn.\n\nGerson proposed the use of a \"smoking gun/mushroom cloud\" mixed-metaphor during a September 5, 2002 meeting of the White House Iraq Group, in an effort to sell the American public on the nuclear dangers posed by Saddam Hussein. According to \"Newsweek\" columnist Michael Isikoff,\nThe original plan had been to place it in an upcoming presidential speech, but WHIG members fancied it so much that when the \"Times\" reporters contacted the White House to talk about their upcoming piece [about aluminum tubes], one of them leaked Gerson's phrase – and the administration would soon make maximum use of it.\n\nGerson has said one of his favorite speeches was given at the National Cathedral on September 14, 2001, a few days after the September 11, 2001 attacks, which included the following passage: \"Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance, and love have no end. And the Lord of life holds all who die, and all who mourn.\"\n\nGerson is credited with coining such phrases as \"the soft bigotry of low expectations\" and \"the armies of compassion\". His noteworthy phrases for Bush are said to include \"Axis of Evil,\" a phrase adapted from \"axis of hatred,\" itself suggested by fellow speechwriter David Frum but deemed too mild.\n\nIn an article by Matthew Scully (one of Gerson's co-speechwriters) published in \"The Atlantic\" (September 2007) Gerson is criticized for seeking the limelight, taking the credit for other people's work and for creating a false image of himself.\n\nIt was always like this, working with Mike. No good deed went unreported, and many things that never happened were reported as fact. For all of our chief speechwriter's finer qualities, the firm adherence to factual narrative is not a strong point.\n\nOf particular note is the invention of the phrase \"axis of evil.\" Scully claims that the phrase \"axis of hatred\" was coined by David Frum and forwarded to colleagues by email. The word \"hatred\" was changed to \"evil\" by someone other than Gerson and was done because \"hatred\" seemed the more melodramatic word at the time.\n\nScully also had this to say about Gerson:\nMy most vivid memory of Mike at Starbucks is one I have labored in vain to shake. We were working on a State of the Union address in John's (McConnell's) office when suddenly Mike was called away for an unspecified appointment, leaving us to 'keep going.' We learned only later, from a chance conversation with his secretary, where he had gone, and it was a piece of Washington self-promotion for the ages: At the precise moment when the State of the Union address was being drafted at the White House by John and me, Mike was off pretending to craft the State of the Union in longhand for the benefit of a reporter.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Gerson wrote for \"Newsweek\" magazine for a time. On May 16, 2007, Gerson began his tenure as a twice-weekly columnist for \"The Washington Post\". His columns appear on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\nGerson, a neo-conservative, has repeatedly criticized other conservatives in his column and conservatives have returned the favor. One of Gerson's first columns was entitled \"Letting Fear Rule\", in which he compared skeptics of President Bush's immigration reform bill to nativist bigots of the 1880s.\n\nIn October 2017, Gerson referred to President Trump's \"fundamental unfitness for high office\" and asked whether he is \"psychologically and morally equipped to be president? And could his unfitness cause permanent damage to the country?\" He cited \"the leaked cries for help coming from within the administration. They reveal a president raging against enemies, obsessed by slights, deeply uninformed and incurious, unable to focus, and subject to destructive whims.\"\n\nIn August 2019, Gerson wrote that it is a \"scandal\" that white evangelical Protestants are not in a state of \"panic\" about their own demographic decline in the United States.\n\nGerson suffers from major depressive disorder.\n\nHis wife Dawn was born in South Korea. She was adopted by an American family when she was six years old and raised in the Midwestern United States. The couple, who met in high school, have two sons and reside in Northern Virginia.\n\n\n"}

He carries guilt from the incident because he could have carried his wife to a hospital and saved her; since he instead chose to stay and perform CPR on his daughter (which failed), while his wife bled to death.\n\nHe moved to the United States of America some time after that for a fresh start, but evidence he suffered from both survivor's guilt and PTSD soon emerged, largely in terms of his personal relationships. Although initially reluctant to settle in one place, preferring to travel between Chicago and an unnamed southern city in his boat, a job offer from Kerry Weaver led him to take a permanent position at County General. This would be the first of several significant decisions Luka would make that were in part influenced by the relationships in his life.\n\nLuka has been in three serious relationships since he settled in Chicago. Soon after arriving at County General he became interested in the then-pregnant Head Nurse Carol Hathaway, although their relationship was largely as friends. For Luka, Carol was a tentative first attempt at romance, albeit with a woman much like his own wife, and for Carol, it was a step toward the next phase of her life. After her twins were born, a kiss between Luka and Carol served as an epiphany for Carol and she left Chicago for Seattle to be with her true love, and the father of her children, Dr. Doug Ross. While involved with Carol, Luka met and began teaching medical student Nurse Abby Lockhart, who would eventually become the longest and most important relationship in his new life. Luka recognized the potential to be a good doctor in her, and began to mentor and encourage when her personal life led to her withdrawal from medical school.\n\nIt was this support along with the loss of Carol that sparked Luka's next relationship. Early into Season 7, Luka became involved with Abby, now an ER nurse, after a spontaneous kiss lead him to reconsider his relationship with her. It was a relationship marked by trouble from their very first date, when they were mugged and Luka unintentionally killed their assailant in self-defense. They drifted into a sexual connection after the mugging, and initially, neither was able to define or commit to their relationship, although for a time they were happy. An encounter with a dying bishop provided Luka with a measure of absolution for the death of his wife, and for a time, he seemed ready to move forward. However, the repeated appearances of Abby's troubled mother, along with the continuous interference by Dr. John Carter, who Abby turned to as an enabler, was too much for the fragile relationship and resulted in a break-up.\n\nAlthough the breakup was acrimonious, Luka remained quite protective of her (especially after she was attacked by her neighbor). Over the next few years, he and Abby slowly forged a close friendship. The break-up affected Luka deeply, however, and he then went through a long period where he was unable to form a satisfactory relationship. He has many demons and tends to be emotionally reclusive and, for a short time, used sex to drown his problems. He had a series of brief flings, before developing an unorthodox relationship with a prostitute who seemed to serve more as a psychotherapist. An affair between Luka and nurse Chuny Marquez ended badly in Season 9 and resulted in Luka being briefly suspended for unprofessional conduct. He rebuffed a series of advances by medical student Erin Harkins (Leslie Bibb) before making a drunken pass after a painful encounter with Abby. Harkins was seriously injured in a car accident the next day, when he drove exhausted and angry in his Dodge Viper. As a result of this, Luka's PTSD and depression lead him to ask for a short leave from the hospital. When Kerry brusquely refused, he went AWOL from County and returned just before Kerry was going to officially fire him. Despite his depression he was able to save a boy's life using an unorthodox method, and was allowed to stay on condition he undergo counseling with which he was minimally cooperative. The combination of guilt over his mistakes at the hospital, survivor's guilt and PTSD eventually lead him to take a high-risk assignment in Africa with the organization Alliance Medicines.\n\nWhen Carter returned to the United States, Luka stayed behind working at a rural clinic in the Congo until he contracted malaria; despite the symptoms, he helped evacuate patients during a rebel attack. However, he was captured by the rebels two days later, along with his surviving patients and co-workers. As the prisoners were dragged one by one to their execution, Luka knelt and began praying (in Croatian) for the first time in years. Though the rebels at first objected and pointed their guns at him, their leader noticed a small cross hanging around Luka's neck, given to him by the mother of a young patient. Thinking Luka was a priest, the rebels knelt around him and joined him in prayer, releasing him the next day along with three of his surviving patients. Carter, having returned to Africa because County had been told Luka was killed (his I.D. had been found in the burned-down clinic), found Luka half-dead from the malaria in a refugee camp. Opting to stay in the Congo for a while, Carter sent Luka back to County on his return flight.\n\nOn his return from Africa, Luka began a relationship with Nurse Samantha Taggart, and for about a year and a half all seemed fairly well until he expressed his desire to have more children. Sam already had a son, Alex, whom she clearly loved very much, but declared, with absolute conviction, that she was completely done with having children. Sam and Luka eventually became frustrated over their inability to communicate with each other (Luka with Sam keeping things from him, and Sam with Luka's unwillingness to discuss his past or acknowledge their relationship had problems) which resulted in Sam and Alex moving out. Their break-up, though somewhat rough, ultimately resolves amicably. One consequence, though, is that Luka's involvement with Alex was now very limited. However, as with most people he meets who have suffered great hardships, Luka continued to act protective around Sam and Alex.\n\nLuka then began seeing Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) again after an argument that turned into a kiss, and an overnight affair. Abby became pregnant by Luka from this encounter and debated whether to have the baby because of her family's history of bipolar disorder. Luka left the decision to her, but a few days later she told him she wanted to keep it; although they still kept both their apartments and did not become engaged (Abby being leery of marriage since her first was a disaster) they began living together and seemed happy.\n\nLuka was a committed physician, and considered one of the more approachable attendings. He also was a supporter of world health, and more than once donated his services to the Doctors Without Borders program, coming close to death on one occasion. Though once a man of faith, Luka has struggled with his religious beliefs. Such doubts arose after the death of his family. While treating Bishop Lionel Stewart (portrayed by James Cromwell), he seemed to come to terms with his bitterness, although he still wrestles with what God is and isn't responsible for. As an Attending, he is generally a patient teacher to residents and medical students, though his commitment to teaching sometimes frustrates nurses who are needed to dash from patient to patient.\n\nHe and Dr. John Carter once had a strong rivalry arising from their feelings of attraction to Abby- to the point that a fencing match in \"Secrets and Lies\" resulted in both of them drawing blood- but their shared experiences in the Congo, as well as the death of Carter's unborn son, made them understand one another better, and they became true friends. It is said in Season 12 that both of them have kept in contact with each other while Carter was still in Africa. It is likely that they stayed in touch up to Season 15, as Carter was aware that both Abby and Luka moved to Boston.\n\nFollowing the departure of Dr Susan Lewis, Luka was made Chief of Emergency Medicine in Season 12, by an initially reluctant Kerry Weaver. His competition was the new Attending, a brilliant but unstable doctor named Victor Clemente; Luka and Clemente had locked horns even before they were competing for the job. The two of them remained hostile for a while, but gradually mended fences; nonetheless, Clemente's personal issues (including being suspected of shooting his girlfriend, and insomnia developed from being stalked by her ex-husband) forced Luka to admit him for PTSD near the end of Season 12 and fire him. Kerry Weaver initially blamed Luka for the havoc Clemente caused on his watch; however, when she realized the board wanted to fire Luka at the start of Season 13 she admitted she had kept him on-staff against Luka's wishes for months, saving his career and getting herself demoted to an Attending. Luka was later forced to consider firing her (which raised protest from many of the staff, including Abby) but he found a way to keep her on-staff. Ultimately, Kerry resigned anyway about halfway through the season and sought a new career in Florida, parting on good terms with Luka.\n\nIn \"Twenty-One Guns,\" the season 12 finale, Kovač is injected with a paralytic medication during an escape attempt by Sam's jailed ex-husband. Because he was unable to breathe independently for some time and could have died, Sam forced her captors to let her intubate him before they took her from the hospital. Luka awoke an hour later with the tube still in his throat, strapped to the gurney. In the following shootout, he watches helplessly from another room as the heavily pregnant Abby falls to the ground from internal injuries she sustained.\n\nIn the season 13 premiere, \"Bloodline,\" Kovač was rescued by Weaver, only to learn that Abby sustained possibly serious injuries as a result of the shootout. Luka accompanies Abby as she is taken up to OB where it is discovered that she will need to have a caesarean section, complications during which led to Abby also having a hysterectomy. The baby (whom Abby and Luka decide to name Josip, after Luka's father, but call \"Joe\" because Abby's father was a fan of boxer Joe Frazier) was born prematurely; consequently, he had underdeveloped lungs and several other serious problems. After several tense weeks and emergency surgery, a healthy Joe was released from the hospital, and Luka and Abby settled into parenthood. Soon after returning to work, Luka had to defend himself in a malpractice suit brought by Curtis Ames (played by Forest Whitaker), a carpenter who suffered a debilitating stroke while under Kovač's care for pneumonia. Luka won the case, but he and Abby were stalked for months by a vengeful Ames. The situation came to a climax when Ames took Luka hostage, subjected him to a night of mental and physical torture (by crushing Kovač's hand in a vise), and shot himself to death, on a rooftop, in front of the horrified doctor, as police surrounded them. Later, Abby asks him to propose to her, and he does. Luka suggests they keep their engagement a secret, to which Abby agrees, but the staff soon finds out.\n\nOnce their secret is out, Abby's slowness planning their wedding begins to frustrate Luka, so he takes action. In the episode \"I Don't,\" Luka prepares a surprise wedding for Abby, and then convinces her to marry him then and there. The night before they are due to depart for their honeymoon, however, he receives a call from Croatia informing him that his father is ill, so the honeymoon is postponed while Luka makes an urgent trip to his native country. When Kovač returns home he is happy to see Joe and Abby. News soon arrived that his father died in Croatia. While preparing to return to Croatia, Abby tells him that she has started drinking again but does not tell him that she slept with another doctor while he was away. While Abby seeks help for her alcoholism, Luka and Joe return to Croatia for his father's funeral. While Abby is in rehab, Luka briefly returns to Chicago to visit her, at which time he quit his job at County. Upon her release from rehab, Abby joins him, and tells him about her infidelity. They return to the US soon after, and Luka begins to show signs he wants to leave the marriage. He takes a position as a doctor in a small hospice voicing a desire to do some good while he tries to decide what to do about the marriage, ignoring Abby's remorse. There, he meets an elderly man who teaches him some lessons about life and forgiveness, and in the Season 14 finale, Luka decides to forgive Abby after first confronting Kevin Moretti. He suggests to Abby that they leave Chicago, and they decide to go.\n\nDuring the 15th and final season of \"ER\", at the end of the episode \"The Book of Abby,\" long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Abby then adds both her and Luka's locker name tags to the wall. Kovač's final appearance in the series came late in the episode, when he comes to pick up Abby before they leave for Boston. They embraced each other with a kiss and gave a final goodbye to their friends at County, a scene echoing the Season 6 episode where Carol leaves him to join Doug in a kiss after telling Luka he would find the right woman some day. Luka is not seen again in the series, but Abby indicates in a phone call to Neela that the three of them are settling in well in Boston.\n\n"}

The University's Francis Crowe Society is named in his honor. Crowe became interested in the American west during a lecture given by Frank Elwin Weymouth (1874-1941), a civil engineer with the United States Bureau of Reclamation. He signed up for a summer job before the end of the lecture. That summer job began a 20-year career with the reclamation service that would change the face of the American west. In 1924, Frank Crowe left the United States Bureau of Reclamation to join the construction firm of Morrison-Knudsen in Boise, Idaho. Morrison-Knudsen had recently signed a partnership with the larger Utah Construction Company to build dams.\n\nWhile working on the Arrowrock Dam in Idaho, Crowe pioneered two practices that are crucial to the construction of large dams. The first was a pneumatic delivery system to transport concrete and the second was a system of overhead cables to allow the pneumatic concrete to be pumped at any point on the construction site. With this technique, Crowe built some of the largest dams in the American west, including the Hoover Dam, Parker Dam downstream from Hoover; Copper Basin and Gene Wash Dams on the Colorado Aqueduct system; and Shasta Dam in Northern California. All these dams were important but none approached the mythic scale or mystique of Hoover Dam.\n\nHe retired in 1944 to his cattle ranch near Redding, California, where he died of a heart attack on February 26, 1946.\n\nThe Hoover Dam construction project and Frank Crowe's role (portrayed by actor Jay Benedict) was dramatised in an episode of the BBC's 2003 docudrama television miniseries \"Seven Wonders of the Industrial World\".\n\nThe project and Frank Crowe's role was also dramatized in The History Channel's series \"\" in episode 9 entitled Bust.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2032871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032871", "title": "Houston Post", "text": "Houston Post\n\nThe Houston Post was a newspaper that had its headquarters in Houston, Texas, United States. In 1995, the newspaper shut down, and its assets were purchased by the \"Houston Chronicle\".\n\nGail Borden Johnson founded the \"Houston Post\" on February 19, 1880. He expanded the paper by acquiring the Houston \"Telegraph\", the legacy of the \"Telegraph and Texas Register\", which operated the first press in Texas after the Texas Revolution. By 1884, however, the paper was financially distressed, when William R. Baker led a group of investors to bailout the publication. Despite their efforts, the original publication ceased in October 1884. The \"Houston Post\" was re-established with the merger of the \"Houston Morning Chronicle\" and the \"Houston Evening Journal\" on April 5, 1885. J. L. Watson was the business manager and Rienzi M. Johnston was the editor. Watson implemented the use of linotype machines to replace the process of manual typesetting. He gained financial control of the paper through acquiring more stock in the company.\n\nShort story writer O. Henry worked briefly for the \"Post\" in 1895 and 1896. He had to leave his position at the \"Post\" when he was indicted for embezzlement from previous employment at a bank in Austin.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1983, the \"Post\" was owned by the Hobby family, who also began Houston's first radio station, KPRC (AM) in 1925. Amid declining sales, the \"Post\" was sold in 1983 to the \"Toronto Sun\". H&C Communications was created in the aftermath of the sale for the Hobby family to retain control of the broadcasting assets that consisted of TV stations across the U.S., especially local NBC affiliate KPRC-TV, and radio station KPRC (AM). Four years later, MediaNews Group, led by William Dean Singleton, bought the paper.\n\nThe \"Houston Post\" building, in the 1970s, had contemporary artwork, slate floors, and wood-grain concrete walls. Tours of the building and its facilities were given at the time.\n\nThe \"Houston Post\" later closed permanently, with the final edition printed on April 18, 1995. Its assets and liabilities were acquired by Hearst Corporation, the publisher of the \"Post\"s rival daily \"Houston Chronicle\". The Hearst Corporation acquired the Houston Post headquarters, which included the newspaper's printing facilities and five offset press lines. Hearst began to use the facilities as part of the production of the \"Houston Chronicle\". \"Houston Chronicle\" newspapers were distributed to former \"Houston Post\" subscribers. The facility now serves as a \"Houston Chronicle\" plant and the headquarters of the \"Houston Chronicle\" Spanish newspaper \"La Voz de Houston\".\n\nThe Hearst Corporation, parent company of the \"Houston Chronicle\", bought out the \"Houston Post\" from Consolidated Papers, Inc. on April 18, 1995, ending a 94-year-old crosstown rivalry. Hearst shut the paper down, reportedly for the purpose of eliminating local competition for readership and advertisers. The former owners cited the increasing cost of newsprint, which they had expected to rise up to $39 million from $26 million the previous year. The Houston Post reported an average daily circulation of over 287,000 that year, with a Sunday circulation of almost 317,000. The Houston Post did not announce the sale of the paper in its final edition on April 18th.\n\nSome \"Houston Post\" articles had been made available in the archives of the \"Houston Chronicle\" website, but by 2005 they were removed. The \"Houston Chronicle\" online editor Mike Read said that the \"Houston Chronicle\" decided to remove \"Houston Post\" articles from the website after the 2001 United States Supreme Court \"New York Times Co. v. Tasini\" decision; the newspaper originally planned to filter articles not permitted by the decision and to post articles that were not prohibited by the decision. The \"Houston Chronicle\" decided not to post or re-post any more \"Houston Post\" articles because of difficulties in complying with the \"New York Times Co. v. Tasini\" decision with the resources that were available to the newspaper.\n\nPeople interested in reading \"Houston Post\" articles may view them on microfilm. The Houston Public Library has the newspaper on microfilm from 1880–1995 and the \"Houston Post Index\" from 1976 to 1994. The microfilm of 1880–1900 is in the Texas and Local History Department of the Julia Ideson Building, while 1900–1995 is in the Jesse H. Jones Building, the main building of the Central Library. In addition the University of Houston's main library has the \"Houston Post\" available on microfilm from 1880 to 1995 and the \"Houston Post Index\" from 1976 to 1979 and from 1987 to 1994. The National Endowment for the Humanities has online searchable past issues of the Houston Post from 1893 to 1903 in the newspaper section. The Dallas Public Library archival collection also has a microfilm collection of the Houston Post from February 23, 1881 - June 1884, March 1887 - December 1906, and June 1977 - March 1995.

{"id": "2032896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032896", "title": "Parade (musical)", "text": "Parade (musical)\n\nParade is a musical with a book by Alfred Uhry and music and lyrics by Jason Robert Brown. The musical premiered on Broadway in December 1998 and won Tony Awards for Best Book and Best Original Score (out of nine nominations) and six Drama Desk Awards. After closing on Broadway in February 1999, the show has had a US national tour and a few professional productions in the US and UK.\n\nThe musical dramatizes the 1913 trial of Jewish factory manager Leo Frank, who was accused and convicted of raping and murdering a thirteen-year-old employee, Mary Phagan. The trial, sensationalized by the media, aroused antisemitic tensions in Atlanta and the U.S. state of Georgia. When Frank's death sentence was commuted to life in prison by the departing Governor of Georgia, John M. Slaton due to his detailed review of over 10,000 pages of testimony and possible problems with the trial, Leo Frank was transferred to a prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where a lynching party seized and kidnapped him. Frank was taken to Phagan's hometown of Marietta, Georgia, and he was hanged from an oak tree. The events surrounding the investigation and trial led to two groups emerging: the revival of the defunct KKK and the birth of the Jewish Civil Rights organization, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).\n\nDirector Harold Prince turned to Jason Robert Brown to write the score after Stephen Sondheim turned the project down. Prince's daughter, Daisy, had brought Brown to her father's attention. Book writer Alfred Uhry, who grew up in Atlanta, had personal knowledge of the Frank story, as his great-uncle owned the pencil factory run by Leo Frank.\n\nThe musical's story concludes that the likely killer was the factory janitor Jim Conley, the key witness against Frank at the trial. The villains of the piece are the ambitious and corrupt prosecutor Hugh Dorsey (later the governor of Georgia and then a judge) and the rabid, anti-semitic publisher Tom Watson (later elected a U.S. senator). Prince and Uhry emphasized the evolving relationship between Frank and his wife Lucille. Their relationship shifts from cold to warm in songs like \"Leo at Work/What am I Waiting For?,\" \"You Don't Know This Man,\" \"Do it Alone,\" and \"All the Wasted Time\". The poignancy of the couple, who fall in love in the midst of adversity, is the core of the work. It makes the tragic outcome – the miscarriage of justice – even more disturbing. \n\nThe show was Brown's first Broadway production. His music, according to critic Charles Isherwood, has \"subtle and appealing melodies that draw on a variety of influences, from pop-rock to folk to rhythm and blues and gospel.\"\n\nThe musical opens in Marietta, Georgia, in the time of the American Civil War. The sounds of drums herald the appearance of a young Confederate soldier, bidding farewell to his sweetheart as he goes to fight for his homeland. The years pass and suddenly it is 1913. The young soldier has become an old one-legged veteran who is preparing to march in the annual Confederate Memorial Day parade (\"The Old Red Hills of Home\"). As the Parade begins (\"The Dream of Atlanta\"), Leo Frank, a Yankee Jew from Brooklyn, NYC, is deeply uncomfortable in the town in which he works and lives, feeling out of place due to his Judaism and his college education (\"How Can I Call This Home?\"). His discomfort is present even in his relationship with his wife, Lucille, who has planned an outdoor meal spoiled by Leo's decision to go into work on a holiday. Meanwhile, two local teens, Frankie Epps and Mary Phagan, ride a trolley car and flirt. Frankie wants Mary to go to the picture show with him, but Mary playfully resists, insisting her mother will not let her (\"The Picture Show\"). Mary leaves to collect her pay from the pencil factory managed by Frank. \n\nWhile Frank is at work, Lucille bemoans the state of their marriage, believing herself unappreciated by a man so wrapped up in himself. She reflects on her unfulfilled life and wonders whether or not Leo was the right match for her (\"Leo at Work\" / \"What Am I Waiting For?\"). Mary Phagan arrives in Leo's office to collect her paycheck. That night, two policeman, Detective Starnes and Officer Ivey, rouse Frank from his sleep, and without telling him why, demand he accompany them to the factory, where the body of Mary Phagan has been found raped and murdered in the basement. The Police immediately suspects Newt Lee, the African-American night watchman who discovered the body (\"Interrogation\"). Throughout his interrogation, he maintains his innocence, but inadvertently directs Starnes' suspicion upon Frank, who did not answer his telephone when Lee called him to report the incident. Leo is arrested, but not charged, and Mrs. Phagan, Mary's mother, becomes aware of Mary's death.\n\nAcross town, a reporter named Britt Craig is informed about Mary's murder and sees the possibility of a career-making story (\"Big News\"). Craig attends Mary's funeral, where the townspeople of Marietta are angry, mournful, and baffled by the tragedy that has so unexpectedly shattered the community. (\"There is a Fountain\" / \"It Don't Make Sense\"). Frankie Epps swears revenge on Mary's killer, as does Tom Watson, a writer for \"The Jeffersonian\", an extremist right-wing newspaper (\"Tom Watson's Lullaby\") who has taken a special interest in the case. In the meantime, Governor John Slaton pressures the local prosecutor Hugh Dorsey to get to the bottom of the whole affair. Dorsey, an ambitious politician with a \"lousy conviction record\", resolves to find the murderer. Dorsey, along with Starnes and Ivey interrogate Newt Lee, but they get no information. Dorsey releases Newt, reasoning that \"hanging another Nigra ain't enough this time. We gotta do better.\" He then attaches the blame to Leo Frank, and sends Starnes and a reluctant Ivey out to find eyewitnesses (\"Something Ain't Right\"). Craig exalts in his opportunity to cover a \"real\" story and begins an effective campaign vilifying Leo Frank. (\"Real Big News\"). \n\nLeo meets with his lawyer, Luther Z. Rosser, who vows to \"win this case, and send him home\". Meanwhile, Dorsey makes a deal with factory janitor and ex-convict Jim Conley to testify against Frank in exchange for immunity for a previous escape from prison. Lucille, hounded by reporters, collapses from the strain and privately rebukes Craig when he attempts to get an interview (\"You Don't Know This Man\"). She tells her husband that she cannot bear to see his trial, but he begs her to stay in the courtroom, as her not appearing would make him look guilty.\n\nThe trial of Leo Frank begins, presided over by Judge Roan. A hysterical crowd gathers outside the courtroom, as Tom Watson spews invective (\"Hammer of Justice\") and Hugh Dorsey begins the case for the prosecution (\"Twenty Miles from Marietta\"). The prosecution produces a series of witnesses, most of whom give trumped evidence which was clearly fed to them by Dorsey. Frankie Epps testifies, falsely, that Mary mentioned that Frank \"looks at her funny\" when they last spoke, a sentiment echoed verbatim by three of Mary's teenage co-workers, Iola, Essie, and Monteen (\"The Factory Girls\"). In a fantasy sequence, Frank becomes the lecherous seducer of their testimony (\"Come Up to My Office\"). Testimony is heard from Mary's mother (\"My Child Will Forgive Me\") and Minnie McKnight before the prosecution's star witness, Jim Conley, takes the stand, claiming that he witnessed the murder and helped Frank cover up the crime (\"That's What He Said\"). Leo is desperate. As prosecutor Hugh Dorsey whips the observers and jurors at the trial into a frenzy, Leo is given the opportunity to deliver a statement. Leo offers a heartfelt speech, pleading to be believed (\"It's Hard to Speak My Heart\"), but it is not enough. He is found guilty and sentenced to hang. The crowd breaks out into a jubilant cakewalk as Lucille and Leo embrace, terrified (\"Summation and Cakewalk\").\n\nLeo has begun his process of appeal. The trial has been noted by the press in the north, and the reaction is strongly disapproving of the way in which it was conducted, but the African-American domestics wonder if the reaction would have been as strong if the victim had been black (\"A Rumblin' and a Rollin'\"). Lucille tries to help Leo with his appeal, but reveals crucial information to Craig, provoking a fight between Leo and Lucille (\"Do it Alone\"). Lucille then finds Governor Slaton at a party (\"Pretty Music\") and attempts to advocate for Leo. She accuses him of either being a fool or a coward if he accepts the outcome of the trial as is. Meanwhile, Tom Watson approaches Hugh Dorsey and tells him that he will support his bid for governor should he choose to make it. Dorsey and Judge Roan go on a fishing trip, where they discuss the political climate and the upcoming election (\"The Glory\").\n\nThe governor agrees to re-open the case, and Leo and Lucille rejoice (\"This is Not Over Yet\"). Slaton visits the factory girls, who admit to their exaggeration (“Factory Girls (Reprise)”), and Minnie, who claims that Dorsey intimidated her and made her sign a statement (“Minnie McKnight's Reprise”). Slaton also visits Jim Conley, who is back in jail as an accessory to the murder, who refuses to change his story despite the noticeable inconsistencies with the evidence, and along with his Chain Gang, does not give any information, much to the chagrin of Slaton (\"Blues: Feel the Rain Fall\"). After much consideration, he agrees to commute Frank's sentence to life in prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, a move that effectively ends his political career. The citizens of Marietta, led by Dorsey and Watson, are enraged and riot (\"Where Will You Stand When the Flood Comes?\"). \n\nLeo has been transferred to a prison work-farm. Lucille visits and he realizes his deep love for his wife and how much he has underestimated her (\"All the Wasted Time\"). After Lucille departs from the prison, a party of masked men (including Starnes, Ivey, Frankie Epps, the Fulton Tower guard and the Old Confederate Soldier) arrives and kidnaps Leo. They take him to Marietta and demand he confess to the murder on pain of death. Leo refuses, and although Ivey is convinced of his innocence, the rest of group is determined to kill him. As his last request, Leo has a sack tied around his waist, since he is wearing only his nightshirt, and gives his wedding ring to Ivey to be given to Lucille. The group hangs him from an oak tree (\"Sh'ma\"). Some time later, a remorseful Britt Craig gives Leo's ring, which has been delivered to him anonymously, to Lucille. He is surprised to discover that she has no plans to leave Georgia, which is now governed by Dorsey, but she refuses to let Leo's ordeal be for nothing. Alone, she gives into her grief, but she takes comfort in believing that Leo is with God and free from his ordeal. The Confederate Memorial Day Parade begins again (\"Finale\").\n\n\nMost critics praised the show, especially the score. However, the public and some critics received the show coolly. A number felt the show took too many liberties in the use of racial slurs. When the show closed, Livent had filed for bankruptcy protection (Chapter 11). Lincoln Center was the other producer solely responsible for covering the weekly running costs.\n\nThe musical premiered on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center on December 17, 1998 and closed February 28, 1999, after 39 previews and 84 regular performances. Directed by Harold Prince, it starred Brent Carver as Leo Frank, Carolee Carmello as Lucille Frank, and Christy Carlson Romano as Mary Phagan.\n\nA U. S. national tour, directed by Prince, started at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta in June 2000, with Jason Robert Brown conducting at some venues. It starred David Pittu as Leo, Andrea Burns as Lucille, Keith Byron Kirk as Jim and Kristen Bowden as Mary.\n\nThe first major production in the United Kingdom played at the Donmar Warehouse from September 24 to November 24, 2007. It was directed by Rob Ashford and starred Lara Pulver as Lucille, Bertie Carvel as Leo, Jayne Wisener as Mary and Stuart Matthew Price as Young Soldier/Frankie. Pulver was nominated for the 2008 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical and Carvel was nominated for Best Actor in a Musical. A double-CD cast recording of this production has been released by First Night Records. The recording includes new material written by Brown for the production and contains all songs and dialogue from the Donmar production.

It has a large head and short, thick greyish-yellow bill. In breeding plumage, males have a pink flush to their face and underparts, and there are extensive white and pink areas in the wings, a pattern that is also present but less marked in non-breeding plumage.\n\nThis species has been genetically included in a group of arid-zone Carduelini finches, which comprises the following species: \"Leucosticte arctoa tephrocotis\", \"Leucosticte arctoa arctoa\", \"Carpodacus nipalensis\", \"Rhodopechys githaginea\", \"Rhodopechys mongolica\".\n\nIts phylogeny has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al.\n\nThis bird is a resident from eastern Turkey, across the Caucasus, east into Central Asia and on to western China and Mongolia and south into the Kashmir. Mountainous areas of stony desert or semi-arid scrub and rocky slopes are favoured for breeding. It is native to Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, India, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. It is a vagrant in Bahrain.\n\nThe first record for Armenia was in 2001 near Vedi. Further birds were seen here in 2002.\n\nIt was first recorded in Azerbaijan at Bulgan in early May 1912 (Beme 1926) Bulgan is in the Nakhchivan region, which is separated from the main part of the country by a strip of Armenian territory; Kirwan & Konrad (1995) incorrectly list this site as being in Armenia. Beddard \"et al.\" (2002) were unaware of any records from the main part of the country.\n\nIn Turkey, the species' occurrence in the far east of the country is well documented, e.g. Kirwan & Conrad (1995), Roselaar (1995).\n\nKirwan \"et al.\" (2000) published information suggesting that the species' Turkish range may be more extensive, including a record in 1999 from Sivrikaya in the Pontic Mountains, 100 km northwest of the core Turkish range, and one in 1982 from Sultanbabadagi, Tunceli, 200 km west of its core range. They also suggest that an adult with a fledged juvenile seen on the eastern side of Lake Tuz in 1967, and identified at the time as desert finches, may actually have been Mongolian finches.\n"}

He is often credited with bringing the Lindy Hop from New York to southern California. Collins worked in over thirty films and performed live and on television.\n\nHe grew up in Newark, New Jersey, and at age 13 learned to dance from his two older sisters. He participated in amateur dance contests in New Jersey. He danced at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, New York. In 1935, he was named Dancer of the Year by \"The New Yorker\" magazine.\n\nCollins moved to Los Angeles in 1936. During the day he worked as a janitor at Simon's Drive-In Diner, and at night he danced at the Diana Ballroom and Casino Gardens. Worried that his Jewish name would hinder his career, he adopted the name \"Dean Collins\" from a wallet he found.\n\nHis career began when he was hired by RKO pictures to choreograph the dancing in \"Let's Make Music\", a movie filmed in 1939 and released in 1940. In 1942 he appeared in the Soundies \"The Chool Song\" released March 23, 1942. He and his partner were billed \"Collins and Colette\", and music was recorded by Spike Jones. He danced in or choreographed nearly forty Hollywood movies, including an appearance in \"Hellzapoppin'\" (1941).\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, he taught swing dancing in Los Angeles. His students included Shirley Temple, Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, Abbott and Costello, Jonathan Bixby, Sylvia Sykes, and Arthur Murray.\n\nCollins' wife, Mary, believes that he contributed a smoothed out style that eliminated the bounce. According to jazz dance researcher Peter Loggins, Dean's style changed over decades, returning toward the end of his life to the Lindy Hop he learned in the Savoy Ballroom in the 1930s. The Collins style seen in Hollywood films was the source for what became known in the 1990s as Hollywood-style Lindy Hop.\n\nHe created a version of the Shim Sham which was meant as a three man performance and was not taught or shared. Jack Arkin and Johnny Mattox were the performers with Collins. Later, Bobby Hefner and Bart Bartolo performed it as well. \n\nJewel McGowan, who was called by her contemporaries the \"greatest female swing dancer\", was his dance partner for eleven years. She appeared with him in \"Buck Privates\" (1941) and \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\" (1942).\n"}

His father was the jurist Friedrich Karl von Savigny, who was then privy councillor of the court of appeals, member of the Prussian council of State, and professor at the University of Berlin, and his mother was Kunigunde Brentano, sister of the poet Clemens Brentano. The father was a Protestant, but the mother was a Catholic, and the children were allowed to follow the religion of the mother. Karl Friedrich was first taught at home, then attended the French Gymnasium at Berlin, the Collegium Romanum at Rome, and the Collegium Sebastianum at Naples. He studied law at Berlin, Munich, and Paris. In 1836 he became an auscultator at Berlin; in 1837 he was a referendar in the court at Aachen, in 1840 secretary of legation at London and Dresden, in 1842 at Lisbon, in 1848 at London. In 1849 he was councillor of legations and member of the ministry of foreign affairs, and in 1850 ambassador at Karlsruhe. While here he was able to win over the Government of Baden for the Prussian policy, and, as Bismarck testified, \"by cautious and tactful bearing to win a commanding position at Karlsruhe for the Prussian government.\"\n\nFrom 1859 Karl Friedrich was Prussian ambassador at Dresden, from 1862 at Brussels, and from 1864 he was minister with full powers at the Diet of the German Confederation at Frankfort. In 1866 he offered at the Diet the Prussian motion for the reform of the German Confederation, and when it was rejected on 14 June, 1866, he declared the withdrawal of Prussia, upon which the Austro-Prussian war began. Later in connection with Bismarck he was plenipotentiary in making a treaty of peace with the states of southern Germany and Saxony. He was the presiding officer of the government conferences for the drafting of a constitution for the North German Confederation, and was a plenipotentiary at the Reichstag which decided the constitution. Thus he performed important services in national affairs. In 1868 he retired partially, and in 1871 entirely, from government positions in order to become one of the parliamentary leaders of the Catholics. From 1867 he was a member of the Lower House of the Prussian Diet, from 1868 a member of the Lower House of the Diet of the North German Confederation, and later of the German Reichstag, or Parliament of the German Empire. In 1871 he took part in the founding of the Centre Party. He was not particularly distinguished as a speaker, but his knowledge, distinguished personality, and connections were of much benefit to the Catholic cause. He believed that \"laws are not made but found\".\n\n"}

His theatre work was also extensive (and included a lengthy tour of New Zealand).\n\nHe is also remembered for a series of different roles in the British science-fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", becoming the first actor to play Davros, the wheelchair-using scientific mastermind and creator of the Daleks. The serial in which the character was first seen, \"Genesis of the Daleks\", was originally broadcast in 1975.\n\nA sudden heart attack resulted in his death in 1995.\n\nWisher's contributions to \"Doctor Who\" began with uncredited voice work in the Second Doctor serial \"The Seeds of Death\" (1969).\n\nThe director of that story, Michael Ferguson, later asked Wisher to play reporter John Wakefield in the Third Doctor serial \"The Ambassadors of Death\" (1970). The following season, he appeared in the Robert Holmes classic \"Terror of the Autons\" (1971), playing Rex Farrel. During the later years of the Pertwee era, Wisher provided Dalek voices in stories including \"Frontier in Space\" (1973), \"Planet of the Daleks\" (1973) and \"Death to the Daleks\" (1974) and acted as the villainous Commissioner Kalik in \"Carnival of Monsters\" (1973).\n\nHe continued to be associated with the series through the early Fourth Doctor years in which he voiced unseen characters in both \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975) and \"Planet of Evil\" (1975); he also acted on-screen in both serials, as Magrik in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" and Morelli in \"Planet of Evil\".\n\nWisher was the first actor to portray Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who spoke with an electronically aided voice. Although the character would be revived in further series, commitments to long-running theatre work prevented him from repeating his role when asked to appear in later stories. However, he did reprise the role in 1993 for \"The Trial of Davros\", an amateur theatrical production staged for charity which he also co-wrote.\n\nIn the period from 1984 to 1987 he created several characters in the Audio Visuals series, works that started the audio production careers of some of the figures currently associated with the licensed Big Finish Productions.\n\nIn 1987 the first video based spinoff, \"Wartime\", was released by Reeltime Pictures, starring John Levene in his television role as Sergeant Benton. Wisher played the ghost of Benton's father.\n\nHe followed this by playing a villain with several faces in \"Summoned by Shadows\", produced by BBV in 1991 and as a Minister in \"The Airzone Solution\" in 1993. That production included performances by four of the actors who had played the lead character in \"Doctor Who\". Finally, he played a spaceship engineer in \"\" in 1994.\n\nOne of his final acting roles was as an evil looking theatre commissionaire in \"Dalekmania\", a documentary about the production of the Dalek movies of the 1960s.\n"}

Jan Kiepura introduced himself as, \"The Great Kiepura,\" to the annoyance of similarly temperamental individuals. His mother was Jewish. He had a brother, Władysław. During 1916–1920, he attended the Junior School in Sosnowiec where he graduated from high school. In 1921 he studied law at the University of Warsaw. He learned singing from Wacław Brzeziński and Tadeusz Leliwa. In 1923 he performed his first concert in the Sphinx cinema in Sosnowiec. In 1924, Jan Kiepura was admitted by Emil Młynarski to the local choir. He played the role of Góral in Moniuszko's opera \"Halka\". He also took part in a production of Gounod's \"Faust\" Faust in the Polish city of Lwow (now in the Ukraine).\n\nIn 1926, Jan Kiepura left Poland for an international career in Germany, Hungary, France, and England. When he returned to Poland, with the money he had earned from his performances, he built the well-known hotel \"Patria\" in the Polish border town of Krynica-Zdrój, which cost him about US$3 million. Some Polish movies were made there. Kiepura played in twelve Polish musicals, including \"O czym się nie myśli\" (1926), \"Die Singende Stadt\" (\"Neapol, śpiewające miasto\") (1930), \"Tout Pour L'amour\" (\"Zdobyć cię muszę\") (1933), and \"Mon coeur t'appelle\" (1934).\n\nKiepura's return to Warsaw in 1934 caused a sensation in the Polish capital, and his musical shows were received with huge enthusiasm. Apart from his performances in concert halls, he also sang to a crowd gathered under the balcony of the Warsaw hotel \"Bristol\". He also sang while standing on his car's roof, or from a carriage's window, and also spoke to the audience. However, he was not a frequent guest in Poland. He signed contracts with Covent Garden in London, Opéra Comique in Paris and National Opera in Berlin. Kiepura also started a film career, working with Berlin's UFA and then with the Motion Picture Industry in Hollywood. He played in many films, of which the most famous are: \"The Singing City\", \"The Song of Night\", \"Ich liebe alle Frauen\", \"The Charm of La Boheme\", \"The Land of Smiles\".\n\nOn October 31, 1936, Kiepura married the Hungarian-born lyric soprano Marta Eggerth (1912–2013). The two often sang together in operettas, in concerts, on records, and in films until his death. In 1937 Kiepura and Eggerth were forced to flee Europe due to the rise of German Nazism and the onset of World War II. They emigrated to the United States.\n\nHe died at the age of 64 in New York and was buried in Powązki Cemetery, Warsaw.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2032938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032938", "title": "Richard Estes", "text": "Richard Estes\n\nRichard Estes (born May 14, 1932 in Kewanee, Illinois) is an American artist, best known for his photorealist paintings. The paintings generally consist of reflective, clean, and inanimate city and geometric landscapes. He is regarded as one of the founders of the international photo-realist movement of the late 1960s, with such painters as John Baeder, Ralph Goings, Chuck Close, Audrey Flack, and Duane Hanson. Author Graham Thompson writes \"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.\" \n\nAt an early age, Estes moved to Chicago with his family, where he studied fine arts at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1952–56). He frequently studied the works of realist painters such as Edgar Degas, Edward Hopper, and Thomas Eakins, who are strongly represented in the Art Institute's collection. After he completed his course of studies, Estes moved to New York City and, for the next ten years, worked as a graphic artist for various magazine publishers and advertising agencies in New York and Spain. During this period, he painted in his spare time. He had lived in Spain since 1962 and, by 1966, was financially able to paint full-time.\n\nEstes stayed true to the photographs he used: when his paintings include stickers, signs, and window displays, they are always depicted backwards because of the reflection. His work rarely included litter or snow around the buildings because he believed these details detract from the buildings themselves. The paintings are always set during daylight hours, suggesting \"vacant and quiet Sunday mornings.\" Estes's works strive to create convincing three-dimensionality on a two-dimensional canvas. His work has been described via a variety of terms, ranging from super-realism, sharp-focus realism, neo-realism, photo-realism, to radical realism. The most frequently used term is super-realism. Most of Estes's paintings from the early 1960s are of city dwellers engaged in everyday activities. Beginning around 1967, he began to paint storefronts and buildings with glass windows and, more importantly, the reflected images shown in these windows. The paintings were based on color photographs he took, which trapped the evanescent nature of the reflections, which would change with the lighting and the time of day. \n\nEstes's paintings were based on several photographs of the subject. He avoided using famous New York landmarks. His paintings provided fine detail that were invisible to the naked eye, and gave \"depth and intensity of vision that only artistic transformation can achieve.\" \nWhile some amount of alteration was done for the sake of aesthetic composition, it was important to Estes that the central and the main reflected objects be recognizable, but also that the evanescent quality of the reflections be retained. \nHe had a one-man show in 1968 at the Allan Stone Gallery. His works have also been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In 1971, Estes was granted a National Council for the Arts fellowship. The same year, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and he became a full Academician in 1984.\n\n"}

Stringfield left the show, the character was not recast and Susan left County General Hospital and the series in Season 3, but Stringfield and the character returned five seasons later as an attending physician in Season 8. Susan Lewis eventually checked out of the ER for good in 2005, at the beginning of Season 12, having been passed over for tenure in favor of John Carter by Kerry Weaver. She was offered a tenured position at a hospital in Iowa City.\n\nDuring the third season of the series, actress Sherry Stringfield left \"ER\" for the first time. In an interview with the \"Chicago Tribune\", Stringfield explained that having a family was one of the primary reasons for her to leave the show. According to \"Entertainment Weekly\", Stringfield's decision to quit angered the show's executive producer John Wells, because she left just as Dr. Lewis got embroiled in a budding romance with Anthony Edwards' Dr. Mark Greene. Stringfield revealed it was not a pleasant situation and said: \"The producers were in shock. They tried to talk me out of it. It took a long time to get out of my contract.\"\n\nHowever, by the time of the eighth season, her schedule allowed her to return to the series. Wells said they were \"delighted to welcome her back as a series regular and can't wait to work with her again.\" Stringfield remained in the main cast for four more seasons, until August 2005, when she announced that she would be leaving \"ER\" again and stated: \"I am extremely grateful for the time I spent on \"ER\",\" Stringfield explained. \"It is a wonderful show, and there are so many people I will miss. But I'm ready for new roles and new challenges.\"\n\nIn Season 1, Susan is a second year resident. She is shown to be an eager and competent young doctor working in the emergency department of County General Hospital. She is good friends with Nurse Carol Hathaway, Dr. Doug Ross and especially Dr. Mark Greene, who is her best friend.\n\nThough an extremely capable doctor, Susan is initially seen to have problems asserting herself. This is frequently taken advantage of by the senior and more forthright doctors in the hospital, such as Dr. Peter Benton and particularly Dr. Jack Kayson. This leads to several confrontations, and animosity worsens when Kayson discharges one of Susan's patients, failing to notice the severity of his symptoms, which ultimately leads to the patient's death. Kayson tries to deflect the blame onto Susan and her competence is questioned. Her superior, Mark, is forced to monitor her every move and their friendship is put under strain as a result. During the case review, however, the board rules in Susan's favor and reprimands Kayson—much to his chagrin. Shortly after, Kayson is rushed into hospital suffering from a heart attack. Despite their past disagreement on the issue, Kayson opts for Susan's non-invasive form of treatment against the advice of a senior doctor, who (like Kayson) is an advocate of surgical angioplasty. Finally asserting herself, Susan stands her ground and refuses to allow Kayson to be treated surgically. Following his recovery, Kayson shows his gratitude by asking Susan to be his valentine date, which she awkwardly declines.\n\nSusan's personal life is far less settled than her professional one. In Season 1, she is seen to have a brief relationship with psychiatrist Div Cvetic, who ultimately has a nervous breakdown and disappears. Susan later learns that he married someone he met through a dating service, run by a taxi driver from his cab. Most of her problems, however, are family-related. Susan's parents, Cookie and Henry, are shown to be flighty (her father is jokingly referred to as a test pilot for Barcalounger) and difficult to talk to. Her older sister, Chloe, is the source of most of her distress, with a seemingly never ending series of problems with alcohol, drugs, men, and money. \nChloe eventually has a baby girl, who she names Susan (\"Little Susie\") after her sister. During Season 2 however, Chloe begins to use alcohol and drugs once again. After deciding that she cannot look after her baby, she leaves Chicago, abandoning Susie on a flustered and overworked Susan, who struggles to be a good mother to the child while completing her demanding residency. Already overstressed, Susan clashes with the new Chief Resident, Kerry Weaver, numerous times, forcing Mark Greene to step in between them. Animosity between Kerry and Susan lessens over time, but never goes away completely.\n\nRealizing that Chloe may never return, Susan considers giving Susie up for adoption. She gets as far as introducing the baby to potential adoptive parents, but cannot bring herself to part with her niece, so she decides to keep her and adopt the child as her own. Susan grows extremely attached to the baby, but she gets a surprise when a reformed Chloe reappears later in the season and tries to reclaim \"little Susie\". Susan can't see past Chloe's mistakes, regardless of her recent turnaround and new responsible boyfriend. Desperate to keep the baby, Susan attempts to fight Chloe for custody, but is forced to reconsider when the judge warns her that she would lose. Susan begrudgingly reaches an agreement with her sister, and after regaining custody of \"little Susie\", Chloe moves her family to Phoenix, Arizona to start a new life. Susan struggles to cope with the loss of her niece and goes through a period of grief and counseling. She throws herself into her work to escape her feelings of loneliness, which manages to impress Weaver and, with Mark's encouragement, Kerry agrees to offer Susan the position of chief resident (she promises to support Susan's promotion if Mark recommends her as County's new attending physician). Much of the ER staff hoped Susan could achieve that title, but Susan turns the position down, later telling Mark that there is more to life than work.\n\nSetting up Sherry Stringfield's departure from the series in Season 3, the beginnings of a romance appears to develop between Susan and Mark, or more to the point, they are shown to have problems identifying their current relationship as friendship. Both seem timid and cautious around each other. Initially more upfront about the situation, Susan invites Mark to join her on holiday in Maui, Hawaii, but is embarrassed when he appears hesitant, and later retracts the offer, feeling she overstepped a boundary. Fearful that he may have missed his chance with Susan, Mark attempts to convey his attraction towards her upon her return, though he cannot find the courage to follow through and is left perplexed by Susan's reticence. It transpires that Susan never actually made it to Maui, she instead visited her sister and \"little Susie\" in Phoenix as she could not overcome her fear of flying. Mark helps her overcome this fear in the following episode (\"Fear of Flying\"), supporting her during a helicopter flight rotation where they are called upon to treat victims of a serious motor accident. As they grow closer, Mark finally plucks up the courage to casually ask Susan out, however she declines, telling him that they \"need to talk\". Shortly after, Mark witnesses Susan in numerous secret talks with the ER's chief of emergency medicine, David Morgenstern, and concludes that they are seeing each other. He confronts Susan, but she reveals that Morgenstern was merely helping her to transfer her residency. Desperately missing her niece, Susan had made the decision to move to Phoenix to be near her sister's family. During a hectic last day for Susan at County's ER, Mark struggles with her imminent departure, but still finds himself afraid to admit his true feelings for her. The hospital staff arrange a leaving party for Susan, but it is canceled due to an influx of critical patients from a motoring accident. Susan leaves the hospital unable to say goodbye to Mark, who was busy working on a trauma patient. She departs the season on a train in the episode 'Union Station', discovering Mark's true feelings for her as he catches her before she gets aboard, pleading with her to stay because he loves her. Despite Mark laying his heart on the line, Susan doesn't see a future in Chicago or with him. She kisses him and says \"I love you, too\" as the train departs.\n\nSusan returns during Season 8 as she left, shown to arrive on a train into Chicago to interview for a job. Susan visits County General for the first time in 5 years and sees the hospital has changed as well as the faces. She meets Mark for coffee and reveals that Chloe has moved on to another city, and she has decided that she can't follow her sister's family around forever. Mark offers her a job as an attending physician at County General, despite Kerry Weaver's reservations – the two never got along when they worked together before.\n\nDuring Season 8 Susan has a brief relationship with Dr. John Carter after they both admit that they had a crush on each other when he was a medical student and she was a resident – it doesn't last, as Susan realizes in the episode \"Secrets and Lies\", that Carter is really in love with Abby Lockhart. She then tells Carter to \"tell her\" about his feelings. The two both break up on good terms and remain good friends throughout the rest of her career at County. Her problems with Chloe resurface when her niece Susie goes missing in New York after leaving a distressing voicemail message on her aunt's phone. Susan flies to New York (in a crossover with \"Third Watch\") and discovers Chloe doped up, sleeping rough. Towards the end of the season, Susan faces one of her most difficult story lines, as her best friend Mark Greene reveals to her that his brain tumor has returned. The two rekindled their close friendship as she helps him come to terms with his diagnosis. Susan is alluded to in Mark's goodbye letter in \"The Letter\" when Mark comments that he had to leave the way he did, even though there were things of a more personal nature to say. After her best friend's death, Susan warmed up to other friendships in the ER with Abby Lockhart and Elizabeth Corday, and was able to work better with her old colleague Kerry Weaver. Dr. Romano also promoted her to Deputy Chief of Emergency Medicine much to Kerry Weaver's dismay.\n\nInto Season 9, Susan meets a flight nurse named Chuck Martin (played by Donal Logue) on a plane to Las Vegas. They both get drunk upon arrival and end up getting married in Vegas. They quickly have the marriage annulled once they return to Chicago, but eventually start dating again, and Susan becomes pregnant. She is finally promoted to the position of Chief of Emergency Medicine after Robert Romano dies in Season 10. While other pregnant characters had given birth on the show, at the time, Susan's was the first major birth offscreen, with her giving birth sometime between Seasons 10 and 11 (and being placed on bedrest amid concerns of preterm labor). Chuck ends up caring for their baby boy Cosmo as a stay-at-home parent while Susan works.\n\nInto Season 11, Susan begins to build some anxiety about the upcoming tenure offer. It ultimately goes to her friend John Carter, due to her lack of grant funding, finally leading to her final exit from the series at the beginning of Season 12 in the episode \"Canon City\". Susan is offered a tenure track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa (presumably University of Iowa). Technically, Stringfield was the first and last original cast member to leave the show. (Being the first to leave in 1996, then in 2005 after the rest of the original cast left.)\n\nIn the season 15 episode \"The Book of Abby\", long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag \"Lewis\" can be seen.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis returned for the series finale titled \"And in the End...\", returning to Chicago for the opening of The Carter Center. During evening drinks with Peter Benton, John Carter, Kerry Weaver, Elizabeth Corday, and Rachel Greene, Susan is heard confirming to Dr. Corday that she still lives in Iowa. Additionally, she states that she and Chuck have split and she is now dating again. She eventually returns to the ER for the last time in the series with Rachel Greene and Carter, where she visits and jokes with the staff, much to the annoyance of Dr. Banfield who interrupts the talk by asking Susan who she is.\n\nSherry Stringfield's decision to leave \"ER\" was a \"shock wave through Hollywood.\" According to \"Entertainment Weekly\", people called Stringfield \"nuts\" for leaving \"the hottest show on TV for some investment banker in New York.\"\n"}

{"id": "2032945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032945", "title": "Match Point", "text": "Match Point\n\nMatch Point is a 2005 psychological thriller film written and directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film deals with themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for a British setting.\n\nCritics in the United States praised the film and its British setting, and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated \"Match Point\" less favourably, finding fault with the locations and especially the British idiom in the dialogues. Allen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nChris Wilton, a recently retired tennis professional from Ireland, is taken on as an instructor at an upmarket club in London. He strikes up a friendship with a wealthy pupil, Tom Hewett, after discovering their common affinity for opera. Tom's older sister, Chloe, is smitten with Chris, and the two begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fiancée, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with Nola, a struggling actress, which is a source of tension in the family. Chloe encourages her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies; he begins to be accepted into the family and marriage is discussed.\n\nDuring a storm, after having her choice of profession questioned by Eleanor, Nola leaves the house to be alone. Chris follows Nola outside and confesses his feelings for her, and they passionately have sex in a wheat-field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident; Chris, however, wants an ongoing clandestine relationship. Chris and Chloe marry, while Tom ends his relationship with Nola.\n\nChloe, to her distress, does not become pregnant immediately. Chris vainly tries to track down Nola, but meets her by chance sometime later at Tate Modern. He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, Chris asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying that she wants to raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him on the street outside his office and he just barely escapes public detection.\n\nSoon afterwards, Chris takes a shotgun from his father-in-law's home and carries it to his office in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's building and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, whom he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns, he shoots her in the stairwell. Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.\n\nDetective Mike Banner invites Chris for an interview in relation to the murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.\n\nOne night, Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions. He replies that his crimes, though wrong, had been \"necessary\", and that he is able to suppress his guilt. At the same time, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders. His theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who informs him that a drug peddler found murdered on the streets had Mrs. Eastby's ring in his pocket. Banner and Dowd consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. Chloe gives birth to a baby boy named Terence, and his uncle blesses him not with greatness but with luck.\n\nThe script was originally set in The Hamptons, a wealthy enclave in New York, but was transferred to London when Allen found financing for the film there. The film was partly funded by BBC Films, which required that he make the film in the UK with largely local cast and crew. In an interview with \"The Guardian\", Allen explained that he was allowed \"the same kind of creative liberal attitude that I'm used to\", in London. He complained that the American studio system was not interested in making small films: \"They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500m.\" A further change was required when Kate Winslet, who was supposed to play the part of Nola Rice, resigned a week before filming was scheduled to begin. Scarlett Johansson was offered the part, and accepted, but the character had to be re-written as an American. According to Allen, \"It was not a problem...It took about an hour.\"\n\nFilming took place in London in the summer of 2004 over a seven-week schedule. Some of the city's landmarks, such as Tate Modern, Norman Foster's \"Gherkin\" building at 30 St Mary Axe, Richard Rogers' Lloyd's building, the Royal Opera House, the Palace of Westminster, Blackfriars Bridge, and Cambridge Circus form a backdrop to the film. The tennis club scenes were filmed at the Queen's Club. One of the University of Westminster's Marylebone campus lecture theatres was also used. UK-based graffiti artist Banksy's \"\" appears briefly in the film. One of the Parliament View apartments at Lambeth Bridge was used for interiors of Chris and Chloe's apartment. The restaurant scene was shot at the Covent Garden Hotel.\n\nThe film's opening voiceover from Wilton introduces its themes of chance and fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, a man who mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein pale in comparison to the purity of interior experience.\n\nThe film is a debate with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\", which Wilton is seen reading early on, identifying him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women to prove that he is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and is finally redeemed by confession of his crime, the love of a young woman forced into prostitution, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film \"Love and Death\". In \"Love and Death\", the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as \"The Brothers Karamazov\", \"Crime and Punishment\", \"The Gambler\", \"The Idiot\", and \"War and Peace\". In \"Match Point\", Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.\n\nAllen revisits some of the themes he had explored in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989), such as the existence of justice in the universe. Both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress, and \"offer a depressing view on fate, fidelity, and the nature of man\". That film's protagonist, Judah Rosenthal, is an affluent member of the upper-middle class having an extramarital affair. After he tries to break the affair off, his mistress blackmails him and threatens to go to his wife. Soon, Rosenthal decides to murder his mistress, but is racked with guilt over violating his moral code. Eventually, he learns to ignore his guilt and go on as though nothing has happened. Philip French compared the two films' plots and themes in \"The Observer\", and characterised \"Match Point\"'s as a \"clever twist on the themes of chance and fate\".\n\nMoney is an important motivator for the characters: both Wilton and Nola come from modest backgrounds and wish to enter the Hewett family using their sex appeal. That family's secure position is demonstrated by their large country estate, and, early on in their relationships, both prospective spouses are supported by Mr. Hewett, Wilton with a position on \"one of his companies\" and Nola reports being \"swept off her feet\" by Hewett's attention and presents. Roger Ebert posed the film's underlying question as \"To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness? Wilton is facing a choice between greed and lust, but his sweet wife, Chloe, herself has no qualms about having her father essentially 'buy' her husband for her.\"\n\nJean-Baptiste Morain, writing in \"Les Inrockuptibles\", noticed how the strong do not accept their own weakness and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and \"arrivisme\", resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.\n\nThe film's soundtrack consists almost entirely of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work as an indicator of social class, such as in \"Husbands and Wives\" (1992). In \"Match Point\", the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.\n\nThe 10-minute murder scene which forms the film's climax is scored with almost the whole of the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's \"Otello\". This is an atypical scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with \"two\" dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.\n\nArias and extracts include work by Verdi (in particular \"Macbeth\", \"La traviata\", \" Il trovatore\" and \"Rigoletto\"), Gaetano Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore\", Georges Bizet's \"Les pêcheurs de perles\", and Antônio Carlos Gomes's \"Salvator Rosa\" sung by Caruso. The romanza \"Una furtiva lagrima\" from \"L'elisir d'amore\" is featured repeatedly, including during the opening credits. The Caruso arias are supplemented by diegetic music from contemporary performances that the characters attend over the course of the film. There are scenes at the Royal Opera House and elsewhere performed by opera singers (scenes from \"La traviata\" performed by Janis Kelly and Alan Oke, from \"Rigoletto\" performed by Mary Hegarty), accompanied by a piano (performed by Tim Lole).\n\nAllen has said that \"Match Point\" is one of his few \"A-films\", and even \"arguably may be the best film that I've made. This is strictly accidental, it just happened to come out right. You know, I try to make them all good, but some come out and some don't. With this one everything seemed to come out right. The actors fell in, the photography fell in and the story clicked. I caught a lot of breaks!\"\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. \"Match Point\" broke a streak of box office flops for Allen: it earned $85,306,374 worldwide, of which $23,151,529 was in its North American run. Allen was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nThe film received generally strong reviews from critics, particularly in the United States. Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received 76% positive reviews, based on 216 reviews from American critics with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Woody Allen's sharpest film in years, \"Match Point\" is a taut, philosophical thriller about class and infidelity.\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100, and thus \"generally favourable reviews\", based on 40 professional critics. Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars, and considered it among the four best Allen films. He described it as having a \"terrible fascination that lasts all the way through\". \"Empire\" magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it Allen's best of his last half a dozen films, and recommended it even to those who are not fans of the director. \n\nReviewers in the United Kingdom were generally less favourable. Philip French, writing in \"The Observer\", criticised Allen's grasp of British idiom and the film's lack of humour, especially considering that two comic actors from the UK were cast in minor roles. Also, he called the dialogue \"rather lumbering\" and said that \"the lexicons of neither the City financier nor the London constable are used convincingly.\" Tim Robey, writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\", disdained the claim that the film was Allen's return to form. Although he acknowledged that the consensus was stronger this time, he called it \"as flat-footed a movie as Allen has ever made, a decent idea scuppered by a setting – London – which he treats with the peculiarly tin-eared reverence of a visitor who only thinks he knows his way around.\" He called Johansson's character \"the chain-smoking mistress from hell\", but said the tennis net analogy has an \"unexpectedly crisp payoff\" and that the last act was well handled. Reviewing for the BBC's website, Andy Jacobs awarded the film four stars out of five, and called it Allen's best film since \"Deconstructing Harry\" (1997). He also criticised some other British reviewers whose dislike, Jacobs stated, was due to the fact that Allen presented an agreeable portrait of middle class life in London. He also praised the performances by Rhys Meyers and Johansson.\n\nLike many of Allen's films, \"Match Point\" was popular in France: AlloCiné, a cinema information website, gave it a score of 4.4/5, based on a sample of 30 reviews. In \"Les Inrockuptibles\", a left-wing French cultural magazine, Jean-Baptiste Morain gave the film a strong review, calling it \"one of his most accomplished films\". He characterised Allen's move to London as re-invigorating for him, while recognising the caricatured portrayal of Britain which made the film less appreciated there than in Allen's homeland, the United States. Morain called Rhys-Meyers' and Johansson's performances \"impeccable\".\n\n\"Match Point\" has also been the object of scholarship. Joseph Henry Vogel argued the film is exemplary of ecocriticism as an economic school of thought. Several critics and commentators have compared elements of the film to the central plot of George Stevens' film \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951), but with some characters in reverse positions.\n\n"}

{"id": "2032974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032974", "title": "Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland", "text": "Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland\n\nA \"postal address\" in the Republic of Ireland is a place of delivery defined by Irish Standard (IS) EN 14142-1:2011 (\"Postal services. Address databases\") and serviced by the universal service provider, \"An Post\". Its addressing guides comply with the guidelines of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the United Nations-affilated body responsible for promoting standards in the postal industry, across the world. \n\nIn Ireland, 35% of Irish premises (over 600,000) have non-unique addresses due to an absence of house numbers or names. In smaller towns and many townlands, this requires postal workers to remember which family names correspond to which house.\n\nIreland was the last country in the OECD to create a postcode system, which is called Eircode. In July 2015 all 2.2 million residential and business addresses in Ireland received a letter notifying them of the new Eircode for their address. Unlike other countries, where postcodes define clusters or groups of addresses, an Eircode identifies an individual address and shows exactly where it is located. The system was criticised at its launch.\n\nResponsibility for the current postal delivery system rests with An Post, a semi-state body; however, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) retains the right to regulate addresses if they wish so.\n\nIn Dublin city and its suburbs, a system of postal districts was introduced in 1917 by the Royal Mail with the prefix \"D\", and retained after Ireland became an independent country, without the prefix. However the use of district numbers by the public did not begin until 1961, when street signs displayed postal district numbers. Prior to that time, street signs only displayed the street name in Irish and English.\n\nThe Dublin system had 22 districts — Dublin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6W, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24. These were incorporated into the routing keys used by the Eircode national postcode system as D01, D02, D12, D22, etc.\n\nThe city of Cork had four numbered postal districts, but these were used internally by An Post and rarely on mail. Cork 1 covered the city centre and large parts of the surrounding city, e.g.: the \"Patrick Street\" (\") sign displays the digit '1'. Cork 2, administered from the Ballinlough sorting office, covered the south-east, Cork 3 (from Gurranabraher) covered the north-west while Cork 4 (from Togher sorting office) covered the south-west. The numbers are not used in the Eircode system, with routing keys in the Cork area instead beginning with the letter 'T'.\n\nThe launch of a national postcode system (Eircode, Irish \") in Ireland began on 28 April 2014. The system incorporates the existing numbered Dublin postal districts as part of the routing key. Eircode made Ireland the first country in the world to have a unique postcode for each address.\n\nThe codes, known as \"Eircodes\", consist of seven characters. The first three characters, called the \"Routing Key\", are designed to benefit the postal and logistics industry and contain on average 15,000 addresses each. The Routing Key is used to help sort mail, it is the principal Post Town of the address as defined by An Post. The second part of the Eircode, called the \"Unique Identifier\", consists of four characters drawn from a carefully selected set of randomised letters and numbers that identify each individual address. They are stored in a central database, Eircode Address Database (ECAD), along with other useful geographic information including addresses, variants/aliases, and geo-coordinates of each address point. Sample product data and pricing details were issued to businesses in March 2015. The ECAD is now available to licence by end-users and value-added resellers called Eircode Providers \n\nAn example of a typical Irish address is that of the Lord Mayor of Dublin: The Eircode is added on as an extra line to the existing address and postal district code which remains unchanged.\n\nUnlike other postcode systems, Eircode is not used for PO Box addresses.\n\nAn Post did not introduce automated sorting machines until the 1990s. By then, the optical character recognition (OCR) systems were advanced enough to read whole addresses, as opposed to just postcodes, thereby allowing An Post to skip a generation. Consequently, mail to addresses in the rest of the state did not require any digits after the address.\n\nWhile An Post stated that the addressing system and sorting technologies make postcodes for mail delivery unnecessary, it was suggested that other services (such as advertising mail providers) would benefit from a national system. After considerable delays, it was announced on 8 October 2013 that codes would be introduced by Spring 2015. A ten-year contract to introduce and implement the postcode system was awarded to Capita Business Support Services Ireland in January 2014 with support from BearingPoint and Autoaddress.\n\nIn 2005 it became the policy of the Government of Ireland to introduce a national scheme of postcodes.\n\nIn May 2005, Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Communications announced that postcodes would be introduced by 1 January 2008, His successor as minister, Eamon Ryan, announced in August 2007 that he was delaying the project pending additional consultation and investigation into the need. On 24 February 2008, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Ryan was finalising the system and hoped to bring the plans to cabinet before the summer of 2008, for introduction in 2009.\n\nAn Post was quoted as saying \"it would be at the heart of the introduction\" and the report of PA Consultants indicated that An Post should be paid over €27 million for its involvement.\n\nFollowing further delays, in September 2009 the cabinet agreed to go ahead with the project. It was to be put out to tender with the end of 2011 given as the date by which postcodes should be assigned. In January 2010 Minister Ryan stated in the that the exact nature of the code would not be decided until the implementation tender process had been completed but that a Location Code with GPS coordinates should be part of the system implemented. On 29 January 2010, a tender to select consultants to assist the Minister for Communications in deciding on the way forward was issued.\n\nThe project was again delayed, but in December 2010 the government agreed to seek tenders for procurement of national postcodes, with an estimated cost of €15 million, with the contract to be awarded in the summer of 2011 with the codes introduced by the end of that year. \n\nOn 29 June 2013 \"The Irish Times\" reported that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, was to bring details to the cabinet meeting of 2 July. According to the report, a postcode operator was to be appointed by September 2013 and every householder and business was to be issued a code by July 2014. Following a cabinet meeting on 8 October 2013 Rabbitte announced that a unique seven-character code would be assigned to every postal delivery point (\"letterbox\") in the state. A consortium led by Capita Ireland was awarded the tender to develop, implement and operate the system, costing €27 million.\n\nConradh na Gaeilge, an organisation advocating use of the Irish language, expressed concern over postcodes or postal abbreviations being based solely on English language place names, e.g. D for Dublin (' in Irish) or WX for Wexford (' in Irish) as is the case with vehicle registration plates. It had advocated that postcodes should either consist solely of numbers, as in many other bilingual or multilingual countries, or be based on Irish language names instead. These concerns were addressed upon the introduction of Eircode. Apart from routing keys corresponding to the previous Dublin postal districts, the initial letters of Eircode routing keys bear no relation to either the English language or Irish language place names within these areas.\n\nIn the light of the liberalisation of postal services and the end of An Post's monopoly, ComReg, the Communications Regulator in Ireland, began considering the introduction of postcodes. A Postcode Working Group met in early 2005 and produced a report recommending the implementation of a postcode system.\n\nOn 23 May 2005, the Minister for Communications, Noel Dempsey, in a government press release announced that postcodes would be introduced in Ireland by 1 January 2008. In November 2005, the National Statistics Board issued a report welcoming the decision and making recommendations as to its implementation. They supported a point-based postcode system that used grid reference/GPS technology to provide a relatively clear-cut, low cost approach to allocating a postcode to an address. This avoids trying to group households together into small area clusters. It was later announced that the postcodes would include the one- or two-character county codes currently used in vehicle registration plates, making them alphanumeric, with the existing Dublin system retained.\n\nIn June 2007, a brief to the new Minister for Communications, Eamon Ryan, stated that a memo was submitted by the Department of Communications to the Irish Government in May 2007 seeking approval for the implementation of the postcode system. It also stated that the decision arising from this submission was that the Minister would revert to Government following further analysis to quantify the benefits, which would then be followed by a public consultation process. In August 2007, the Minister reportedly postponed the implementation of the system \"indefinitely\" pending additional public consultation.\n\nOn 18 October 2007 Eamon Ryan announced at ComReg's \"Postal Services in the 21st Century\" conference that \"[Post] codes should be introduced as a matter of priority\". The introduction was stated to be subject to cabinet approval. On 25 February 2008 the \"Irish Independent\" reported that the proposals were being presented to the Cabinet with a view to full national implementation before summer 2008. It stated that Eamon Ryan was finalising the proposals, which include a 6 character format postcode, giving a sample of \"D04 123\" where \"D04\" corresponded to the current Dublin 4 postal region and \"123\" was a specific group of buildings. similar to British and Dutch postcodes, which cover groups of buildings, rather than simply suburbs or towns.\n\nOn 7 December 2008, the \"Sunday Business Post\" reported results of an independent report by PA Consulting for the Department indicating that benefits of up to €22m could be achieved for public bodies through the introduction of a postcode. The PA report indicated that postcodes had greater uses beyond the delivery of mail or simple navigation services, citing the \"need for efficient database based on postcodes reducing inefficient service delivery and infrastructural planning\". It said that Postcodes are considered critical for \"efficient spatial planning and aiding health research, education, housing social care and employment integration\". Increased efficiencies for businesses would emerge; in particular, the insurance sector stated that \"it would result in annual savings of around €40 million by improving their risk management assessments.\"\n\nThe article concluded saying that annual maintenance costs for a postcode management licence holder which would include maintaining the necessary database of buildings are estimated \"at about €2.5 million\" but the minister was reported as saying that \"ongoing costs would be covered by income generated by the eventual licence holder\".\n\nIn September 2009, Minister Ryan said that an alphanumeric system would be introduced in 2011 at a fraction of the previous estimate of €50 million. This was reiterated a month later in a debate, in spite of claims to the contrary by the Communication Workers Union. Liz McManus, opposition spokeswoman for communications in the Labour Party, called for the plan to be revoked due to job losses in An Post, the projected costs and fears of junk mail.\n\nIn Dail question time in January 2010, Simon Coveney challenged Minister Ryan's apparent rejection of a GPS based postcode system and argued that a system that pinpointed 20–50 houses would be only a slight improvement. Ryan disputed Coveney's remarks, saying that he fully supported a postcode system that had geo-coordinates at its centre, and that the system chosen would depend on the tenders received.\n\nThe tender process to select consultants was announced on 1 February 2010, with a view to having the postcode system operational by the end of 2011.\n\nIn April 2010, the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published a report criticising some of the proposals listed above, recommending instead that any postcode implemented must be capable of supporting \"developing technologies such as internet mapping, google maps and iPhones\", applying a unique identifier to each property. It suggests that the previously mentioned D04 123 model would not satisfy this requirement and may, in fact, make matters worse.\n\nOn 15 April 2010 the tendering process to select a consultant to advise the Minister on the implementation of a postcode was cancelled, due to a serious but unspecified technical error in the tendering documents.\n\nLegislation to \"provide for the establishment, operation and maintenance of a system of postcodes\" – the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 – was introduced in November 2010. The bill was enacted in August of the following year, with Part 3 of the act dealing with the establishment of a National Postcode System. Postcodes are defined in the legislation as \"\"a code consisting of numbers or other characters or both numbers and other characters that identifies the locality of an address and, where appropriate, the geographic location of an address\"\". The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is empowered to award a contract for \"the development, implementation and maintenance of a system... for the allocation, dissemination and management of postcodes for the purposes of, or relating to, the provision of postal services and the use of the national postcode system by other persons for such other purposes as the Minister considers appropriate\".\n\nOn 29 June 2013 \"The Irish Times\" reported that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, was to bring details to the cabinet meeting of 2 July. According to the report, a postcode operator was to be appointed by September 2013 and every householder and business was to be issued a code by July 2014. Following a cabinet meeting on 8 October 2013 Rabbitte announced that a unique seven-digit would be assigned to every post-box in the state. A consortium led by Capita Ireland had been awarded the tender to develop, implement and operate the system, at a cost of €27 million over a ten-year period. On the roll-out day in July 2015, householders and businesses were able to look them up online in advance of receiving a posted notification. The Eircode website received over 1.5 million hits in the first 48 hours.\n\nEach code consists of seven letters and/or digits, in the format A65 B2CD. The first three characters represent one of 139 geographical district or post-towns. The existing Dublin postal districts form the first three characters (the \"Routing Key\") in the system.\n\nThe following is a list of Eircode routing keys:\nAn Post had previously claimed that a nationwide public postcode system was unnecessary, stating that it was \"a 1960s solution to a 21st century problem\", that it would be expensive, and that its existing system was superior. They later became actively involved in implementing the new Eircode system, with their CEO saying they were investing in their four main sorting centres to adopt the new postcode system at a cost of €1m, according to an \"Irish Times\" report stating \"An Post chief executive Donal Connell said it would work \"very closely\" with Eircode, the new company set up by Capita to manage the codes, in implementing the national infrastructure. \"It will certainly help with the efficiency of our distribution'. Mr Connell said €1 million from An Post’s capital investment fund would be spent to install new software in its four national sorting centres. Courier services and advertising mail companies complained that the absence of such a system put Ireland at a disadvantage compared with other European countries.\n\nAn Post had used a system of three-digit sort codes, similar to the Mailsort system used by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom, for pre-sorting mail in bulk. There were two levels, Presort 152, which had 152 codes for large volumes of mail, and Presort 61, which had 61 codes for smaller volumes.\n\nIt corresponded to Dublin postal districts: Dublin 1 is 101, etc., except for Dublin 10 and Dublin 20, both of which had the same code 110, and Dublin 6W, which was 126. Cork had codes for four each of the delivery offices, Ballinlough (901), North City (902), Little Island (903), and South City (903).\n\nThe Eircode system has been criticised for using an unsequenced code limited to postal addresses on the grounds that it undermines the system's utility. The cost, procurement methods used, slow rollout and implementation of the system (originally proposed in 2003) were criticised, including in a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.\n\nA March 2019 survey of homes and businesses commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reported that 30% never quoted the Eircode when giving their address, 32% did so only \"occasionally,\" 22% \"frequently,\" and 12% \"always.\". In contrast, a November 2019 survey for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment claimed \"94 per cent of people are using Eircodes,\" although the last survey data posted by eircode itself shows usage levels of 74% or less.\n\nEstablished by An Post and the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, the Geodirectory, is a database of every building in the Republic of Ireland. The database contains every Postal Address in Ireland, a corresponding Geographic Address, the District Electoral Division (a grouping of addresses useful for analysis and defining catchment areas of services), a system address reference (not in use by individuals), and the location coordinates. It is available for commercial use and has been used by several commercial companies for various geo-location and data cleansing purposes.\nIt is the source of all addresses in the Eircode ECAD database. It is also used by Google Maps in Ireland to identify and search for building names on mapping. For example, one of the entries in its sample database is Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, building ID 10003105 (at ITM 648555.822, 698833.088).\n\nSeveral coding systems emerged in Ireland in the years before the introduction of Eircode. All of these systems took the approach of coding geographic locations rather than postal addresses. None of the systems are compatible with the sorting requirements of An Post, as they do not encode a Post Town into their code. The first three characters of an Eircode relate to a Post Town that An Post have defined to facilitate manual sorting of post. As they only encode a location, they are not capable of providing a unique code for every address, for example multiple apartments in the same building would have the same code.\n\nThe GO (\"gee-o\") Code was developed by Go Code Ltd. in Dublin, 2007. It is a multi-character alphanumeric geographic (rather than postal routing) code calculated from latitude and longitude that varies final accuracy according to the number of characters used. The Ireland version uses 7-characters giving an accuracy of 5 metres squared. The equivalent code for the Midland Regional Hospital, as above, is KHG RT76. It was adopted by TomTom for use on its various satnav models in 2010 and GO Code was the first to develop a location code app on the iPhone App Store. The code design allows for greater or lesser granularity with the addition or subtraction of characters from the end of the code. The company has also been developing Go Code designs for use in other countries, including India, (9 characters) where it is being piloted within the slums in Kolkata, to help bring essential health, education and social services to the people living there. The GO Code project first brought together some of the companies that would go on to produce the winning Eircode tender, including Capita, BearingPoint, and Autoaddress.\n\nThe Loc8 Code was developed by GPS Ireland Ltd. and field tested with Garmin in 2008. It is now owned and managed by Loc8 Code Ltd. in Cork. Like GO Code, it is a geocoding, rather than address identification system: an 8 character alphanumeric code calculated from latitude and longitude to an accuracy of within 6 metres in any direction. It includes a checksum character. The equivalent code for the Midland Regional Hospital is RFT-41-M46 .\n\nLoc8 codes cannot be computed directly to or from a geographical location without the assistance of software produced by Loc8 Code. The licence conditions for the code prohibit any third party from reverse-engineering the algorithm.\n\nThe Loc8 code consists of at least three discrete parts, each of which imparts increasing accuracy of the location. Taking the previous example, if the code is truncate to its first three characters (\"RFT\") an area of approximately 3.5 km square is defined; the addition of the last three characters (\"RFT-M46\") narrows this down to an area of 120 square metres and provides a checksum digit (\"6\").\n\nSome basic efforts are made to avoid Loc8 Codes being accidentally parsed as Royal Mail postcodes post codes, particularly those for addresses in Northern Ireland. The coding also avoids optically-similar characters (e.g., \"I\" and \"1\") and \"word-like\" codes.\n\nLoc8 Code allows conversion from Eircodes to its own codes.\n\nThe OpenPostcode is an open-source project under development since 2011. It is a variable-length alphanumeric location code calculated using a free algorithm from latitude and longitude to an accuracy of within an average of 3 metres at 7 characters. An optional checksum is added. It is currently implemented in proprietary utility company systems. A proof of concept website and Android app were available. An equivalent code for the Midland Regional Hospital is RK3P5 (the exact coordinates as listed in the GeoDirectory are RK3P5J5J).\n\nDespite its name, OpenPostcode does not identify a postal address, or provide any information to aid routing of deliveries. It codes only a geographical location, and thus provides no ability to issue different codes to addresses within the same building, for example.\n\nThe Irish implementation of OpenPostcodes uses a grid extending from 55.5°N 10.75°W at its north west corner, and covering the whole of the island of Ireland and outlying islands such as Rathlin Island. The south east corner of the grid is just south of Skomer, west Wales, at 51.3°N 5.35°W.\n\nRedesigned in 2015, version 4, as a spiral of its 25 characters starting with 2 in the bottom left and continuing clockwise to X in the middle, the grid has the following format:\nEach grid square is subsequently divided into a grid of the same format, and likewise for the resulting squares, until the required precision has been attained. For each subdivision, the resulting number or letter is added onto the geocode. X will always be the centre. The letter V has been removed and replaced with B, which is now uppermost top-right so as to place any B codes firmly within the UK postcode area BT and avoid any confusion.\n\nThe algorithm works with any combination of 25 characters, or more, as required. This specific grid is optimised for Ireland.\n\nAccording to OpenPostcode.org Ireland, the expected precision is as follows:\nA checksum can be generated for codes of any length. Apart from helping to confirm that Irish OpenPostcodes have been entered accurately without errors such as juxtaposed letters and digits, it can be used to determine whether the code relates to Ireland, or to Hong Kong or Yemen, places for which similar geocodes are based, where the location-based checksum result will differ.\n\n\n"}

The president is elected by the parliament for a term of six years, which is not immediately renewable. By convention, the president is always a Maronite Christian who is at least 21 years old.\n\nThe current president is Michel Aoun.\n\nFrom the expiration of the term of President Michel Suleiman in May 2014 until October 31, 2016, the parliament was unable to obtain the majority required to elect a president, and the office was vacant for almost two and a half years, despite more than 30 votes being held. On October 31, 2016, the parliament finally elected Michel Aoun as President.\n\nThe constitution requires the president hold the same qualifications as a member of Parliament (also called the Chamber of Deputies), which are Lebanese citizenship and attainment of the age of twenty-five . \n\nThough not specifically stated in the constitution, an understanding known as the National Pact, agreed in 1943, customarily limits the office to members of the Maronite Christian faith. This is based on a gentlemen's agreement between Lebanon's Maronite Christian president Bechara El Khoury and his Sunni Muslim prime minister Riad Al Solh, which was reached in 1943, when Lebanon became independent of France, and described that the president of the Republic was to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of Parliament a Shia Muslim.\n\nArticle 50 of the constitution of Lebanon requires the president to take an oath upon assuming office, which is prescribed thus: \n\nAs described in the constitution, the president is commander-in-chief of the Lebanese Armed Forces and security forces; may appoint and dismiss the prime minister and cabinet; promulgates laws passed by Parliament; may also veto bills; and may dissolve Parliament. In addition, he may also issue \"emergency\" legislation by decree. In practice, however, Lebanon being a parliamentary republic, the president is essentially the repository of reserve powers and the office is largely symbolic. Nevertheless, the president remains by far and large the most important member of the executive, and his veto on any legislation \"de facto\" ensures that it will not be law. This is despite his powers having been somewhat moderated under Ta'if, notably with the increase in the powers of the Cabinet; nevertheless, these reforms have not substantially altered the president's power, as he is still the sole person who can nominate and fire the prime minister and the Cabinet.\n\nHis major responsibilities (following Ta'if) include:\n\n\nPreviously to Ta'if, the president only needed the \"favourable advice\" of his ministers, rather than a clear consensus/majority. Nevertheless, while it may seem that the president is a \"symbolic role\" or significantly subjected to the will of his ministers, constitutionally, it is not so. The president retains the right to fire the entire government at will, and is still the person who nominates every minister - thereby effectively ensuring that they will all be favorable to him. In practice, the president's office has been weakened because of a) no clear majorities of parties and blocs in Parliament, b) the election of \"consensus\" (meaning generally weak, or defferent), presidents, and c) the formation of divided cabinets. The perceived weakness of the president is thus rooted in political, rather than constitutional, issues.\n\nFollowing the ratification of the Ta'if Accord, the Constitution laid out a preamble for the three \"key\" executive posts: the president, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers. The preamble states the following:\n\nThe posts that come with the presidency are as follow:\n\n\nThe presidential residence is the Baabda Palace, located southeast of Beirut.\nThe president's car is a W221 Mercedes-Benz S 600 Guard armoured limousine and it is escorted by the Republican Guard's SUVs and other security vehicles including the preceding official state car, an armoured W140 S 600 now possibly used as a back up limo.\n\nThirty to sixty days before the expiration of a president's term, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies calls for a special session to elect a new president, which selects a candidate for a six-year term on a secret ballot in which a two-thirds majority is required to elect. If no candidate receives a two-thirds majority, a second ballot is held in which only a majority is required to elect. An individual cannot be reelected president until six years have passed from the expiration of his or her first term.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the issue of the quorum needed to call to order a parliamentary presidential electoral meeting. In the absence of a clear provision designating the quorum needed to elect the president, the constitution is open to differing interpretations. According to one view on the issue, a quorum constituting a majority of fifty-percent plus one (that required for any meeting of Parliament) is sufficient for a parliamentary presidential electoral meeting. Another view on the issue argues that the quorum is a two-third majority of the total members of Parliament as Article 49 of the constitution requires a two-third voting majority to elect the president in the first round and, if the quorum were half plus one, there would have been no need to require the two-third voting majority when the number of deputies present at the meeting does not exceed the quorum.\n\n"}

Evidence of refined floristry is found as far back as the culture of ancient Egypt. Professionally designed floral designs, arrangements or artwork incorporate the elements of floral design: line, form, space, texture, and color, and the principles of floral design: balance, proportion, rhythm, contrast, harmony, and unity.\n\nThere are many styles of floral design including Botanical Style, Garden Style, Crescent Corsage, Nosegay Corsage, Pot au Fleur, Inverted \"T\", Parallel Systems, Western Line, Hedgerow Design, Mille de Fleur, and Formal Linear.\n\nThe Eastern, Western, and European styles have all influenced the commercial floral industry as it is today. Ikebana is a Japanese style of floral design, and incorporates the three main line placements of heaven, human, and earth. In contrast, the European style emphasizes color and variety of botanical materials not limited to just blooming flowers, in mass gatherings of multiple flowers. Western design historically is characterized by symmetrical, asymmetrical, horizontal, and vertical style of arrangements.\n\nIn addition to flower arrangements, floral design includes making wreaths, nosegays, garlands, festoons, boutonnieres, corsages, and bows.\n\nPermanent creations and components incorporating dried materials such as bark, wood, dried flowers, dried (and often aromatic) inflorescences, leaves, leaf skeletons, preserved materials and artefacts, are common extensions of the art floral design, and are of practical importance in that they last indefinitely and are independent of the seasons. Their materials offer effects, idioms, and associations complementary to, and contrasting with, fresh flowers and foliage.\n\nWith the ever-growing interest in the natural world and flowers, the floral industry continues to grow. The increase in educational institutes providing training in floral design has expanded to many state universities as well as certified design schools worldwide.\n\nProminent industry associations that promote floral design worldwide include the American Institute of Floral Designers (AIFD), the Society of American Florists (SAF), and the National Association of Flower Arranging Societies (NAFAS).

They were discovered by\n,\n, and\n\nPainlevé transcendents have their origin in the study of special functions, which often arise as solutions of differential equations, as well as in the study of isomonodromic deformations of linear differential equations. One of the most useful classes of special functions are the elliptic functions. They are defined by second order ordinary differential equations whose singularities have the Painlevé property: the only movable singularities are poles. This property is rare in nonlinear equations. Poincaré and L. Fuchs showed that any first order equation with the Painlevé property can be transformed into the Weierstrass elliptic function or the Riccati equation, which can all be solved explicitly in terms of integration and previously known special functions. Émile Picard pointed out that for orders greater than 1, movable essential singularities can occur, and found a special case of what was later called Painleve VI equation (see below).\n(For orders greater than 2 the solutions can have moving natural boundaries.) Around 1900, Paul Painlevé studied second order differential equations with no movable singularities. He found that up to certain transformations, every such equation \nof the form\n\n(with \"R\" a rational function) can be put into one of fifty \"canonical forms\" (listed in ).\nand as a result he missed three of the equations, including the general form of Painleve VI.\nThe errors were fixed and classification completed by Painlevé's student . Independently of Painlevé and Gambier, equation Painleve VI was found\nby from completely different considerations:\nhe studied isomonodromic deformations of linear differential equations with regular singularities.\nIt was a controversial open problem for many years to show that these six equations really were irreducible for generic values of the parameters (they are sometimes reducible for special parameter values; see below), but this was finally proved by and .\nThese six second order nonlinear differential equations are called the Painlevé equations and their solutions are called the Painlevé transcendents.\n\nThe most general form of the sixth equation was missed by Painlevé, but was discovered in 1905 by Richard Fuchs (son of Lazarus Fuchs), as the differential equation satisfied by the singularity of a second order Fuchsian equation with 4 regular singular points on P under monodromy-preserving deformations. It was added to Painlevé's list by .\n\nThese six equations, traditionally called Painlevé I-VI, are as follows:\nThe numbers α, β, γ, δ are complex constants. By rescaling \"y\" and \"t\" one can choose two of the parameters for type III, and one of the parameters for type V, so these types really have only 2 and 3 independent parameters.\n\nThe singularities of solutions of these equations are \n\nFor type I, the singularities are (movable) double poles of residue 0, and the solutions all have an infinite number of such poles in the complex plane. The functions with a double pole at \"z\" have the Laurent series expansion\nconverging in some neighborhood of \"z\" (where \"h\" is some complex number). The location of the poles was described in detail by . The number of poles in a ball of radius \"R\" grows roughly like a constant times \"R\".\n\nFor type II, the singularities are all (movable) simple poles.\n\nThe first five Painlevé equations are degenerations of the sixth equation.\nMore precisely, some of the equations are degenerations of others according to the following diagram, which also \ngives the corresponding degenerations of the Gauss hypergeometric function\n\nThe Painlevé equations can all be represented as Hamiltonian systems.\n\nExample: If we put\nthen the second Painlevé equation \nis equivalent to the Hamiltonian system\nfor the Hamiltonian \n\nA Bäcklund transformation is a transformation of the dependent and independent variables of a differential equation that transforms it to a similar equation. The Painlevé equations all have discrete groups of\nBäcklund transformations acting on them, which can be used to generate new solutions from known ones.\n\nThe set of solutions of the type I Painlevé equation \nis acted on by the order 5 symmetry \"y\"→ζ\"y\", \"t\"→ζ\"t\"\nwhere ζ is a fifth root of 1. There are two solutions invariant under this transformation, one with a pole of order 2 at 0, and the other with a zero of order 3 at 0.\n\nIn the Hamiltonian formalism of the type II Painlevé equation\nwith \ntwo Bäcklund transformations are given by\nand\nThese both have order 2, and generate an infinite dihedral group of Bäcklund transformations (which is in fact the affine Weyl group of A; see below).\nIf \"b\"=1/2 then the equation has the solution \"y\"=0; applying the Bäcklund transformations generates an infinite family of rational functions that are solutions, such as \"y\"=1/\"t\", \"y\"=2(\"t\"−2)/\"t\"(\"t\"−4), ...\n\nOkamoto discovered that the parameter space of each Painlevé equation can be identified with the Cartan subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra, such that actions of the affine Weyl group lift to Bäcklund transformations of the equations. The Lie algebras for P, P, P, P, P, P are 0, A, A⊕A, A, A, and D,\n\nOne of the main reasons for which Painlevé equations are studied is their relations with monodromy\nof linear systems with regular singularities; in particular, Painlevé VI was discovered\nby Richard Fuchs because of this relation. This subject is described\nin the article on isomonodromic deformation.\n\nThe Painlevé equations are all reductions of integrable partial differential equations; see .\n\nThe Painlevé equations are all reductions of the self dual Yang-Mills equations; see .\n\nThe Painlevé transcendents appear in random matrix theory in the formula for the Tracy–Widom distribution, the 2D Ising model, the asymmetric simple exclusion process and in two-dimensional quantum gravity.\n\nThe Painlevé VI equation appears in two-dimensional conformal field theory: it is obeyed by combinations of conformal blocks at both formula_13 and formula_14, where formula_15 is the central charge of the Virasoro algebra.\n\n\n"}

Desired time-domain responses are translated into frequency domain tolerances, which lead to bounds (or constraints) on the loop transmission function. The design process is highly transparent, allowing a designer to see what trade-offs are necessary to achieve a desired performance level.\n\nUsually any system can be represented by its Transfer Function (Laplace in continuous time domain), after getting the model of a system. \n\nAs a result of experimental measurement, values of coefficients in the Transform Function have a range of uncertainty. Therefore, in QFT every parameter of this function is included into an interval of possible values, and the system may be represented by a family of plants rather than by a standalone expression. \n\nformula_1\n\nA frequency analysis is performed for a finite number of representative frequencies and a set of \"templates\" are obtained in the NC diagram which encloses the behaviour of the open loop system at each frequency.\n\nUsually system performance is described as robustness to instability (phase and gain margins), rejection to input and output noise disturbances and reference tracking. In the QFT design methodology these requirements on the system are represented as frequency constraints, conditions that the compensated system loop (controller and plant) could not break.\n\nWith these considerations and the selection of the same set of frequencies used for the templates, the frequency constraints for the behaviour of the system loop are computed and represented on the Nichols Chart (NC) as curves. \n\nTo achieve the problem requirements, a set of rules on the Open Loop Transfer Function, for the nominal plant formula_2 may be found. That means the nominal loop is not allowed to have its frequency value below the constraint for the same frequency, and at high frequencies the loop should not cross the \"Ultra High Frequency Boundary\" (UHFB), which has an oval shape in the center of the NC.\n\nThe controller design is undertaken on the NC considering the frequency constraints and the \"nominal loop\" formula_3 of the system. At this point, the designer begins to introduce controller functions (formula_4) and tune their parameters, a process called Loop Shaping, until the best possible controller is reached without violation of the frequency constraints.\n\nThe experience of the designer is an important factor in finding a satisfactory controller that not only complies with the frequency restrictions but with the possible realization, complexity, and quality.\n\nFor this stage there currently exist different CAD (\"Computer Aided Design\") packages to make the controller tuning easier.\n\nFinally, the QFT design may be completed with a pre-filter (formula_5) design when it is required. In the case of tracking conditions a shaping on the Bode diagram may be used. Post design analysis is then performed to ensure the system response is satisfactory according with the problem requirements.\n\nThe QFT design methodology was originally developed for \"Single-Input Single-Output\" (SISO) and \"Linear Time Invariant Systems\" (LTI), with the design process being as described above. However, it has since been extended to weakly nonlinear systems, time varying systems, distributed parameter systems, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems (Horowitz, 1991), discrete systems (these using the Z-Transform as transfer function), and non minimum phase systems. The development of CAD tools has been an important, more recent development, which simplifies and automates much of the design procedure (Borghesani et al., 1994).\n\nTraditionally, the pre-filter is designed by using the Bode-diagram magnitude information. The use of both phase and magnitude information for the design of pre-filter was first discussed in (Boje, 2003) for SISO systems. The method was then developed to MIMO problems in (Alavi et al., 2007).\n\n\n\n"}

The name was derived from Williams' love of Western films, with him and the band wearing cowboy hats and boots. The original line-up consisted of Braxton Schuffert (guitar), Freddie Beach (fiddle), and the comedian Smith \"Hezzy\" Adair. The youngest member of the band was thirteen-year-old steel guitar player James E. Porter. During the 1930s, the Drifting Cowboys varied from one show to another, with members playing a few shows before leaving and being replaced. In 1944, Don Helms joined the band playing the steel guitar, and Sammy Pruett on guitar, however both left the band after a year.\n\nWhen Williams signed with Sterling Records, he formed a new band: R.D Norred (steel guitar), Joe Pennington (guitar), Herbert \"Lum\" York (bass) and Winston Todd (guitar). Hank and Audrey Williams requested a loan to buy the band matching outfits that they wore on performances. The band was renewed by Williams for his first appearance on the \"Louisiana Hayride\" in 1948, with Bob McNett (guitar), \"Lum\" York (bass), Tony Francini (fiddle), Felton Pruett (steel guitar) and Dent Holmes (guitar).\n\nFor his June 1949 debut at the \"Grand Ole Opry\", Williams formed the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys: Bob McNett (guitar), Hillous Butrum (bass), Jerry Rivers (fiddle) and Don Helms (steel guitar). Until 1950, Williams' songs were recorded with session musicians, with the label crediting the backing to the Drifting Cowboys Band. In 1950, McNett and Butrum left the band, being replaced by Sammy Pruett and Cedric Rainwater. In 1951, before undergoing back surgery and not knowing how long he would be unable to tour, Williams disbanded the group. During 1952, he was not backed by the Drifting Cowboys. After his death, the band was used for a short time by Ray Price. Band members would later tour as the Drifting Cowboys for several years.\n\n\n\n"}

Master gathered seven unnamed criminal scientists to assist him in taking over the world and eliminating Superman and the Teen Titans. H.I.V.E.'s first known plot involved kidnapping Lois Lane and removing her memories. They subsequently attempted to learn more about the return of Superman Island from space, and hired Deathstroke the Terminator to kill the New Titans. H.I.V.E. was also responsible for turning Deathstroke's son Grant Wilson into Ravager.\n\nLater, the H.I.V.E. Mistress murdered her husband and took control of his organization. Although clearly insane, she nevertheless garnered the same obedience from her underlings as her husband once did. She initiated an ambitious scheme called Operation: Waterworks wherein she attempted to destroy the underwater city of Atlantis. This was meant to be little more than a display of power which she would then use to blackmail world leaders into surrendering to the H.I.V.E. The Mistress' plan alerted the attention of former Titans members Aqualad and Aquagirl who in turn sought assistance from the Titans. The Teen Titans journeyed to the H.I.V.E.'s undersea base for one final confrontation. They succeeded in staving off the attack against Atlantis and also crippled the H.I.V.E.'s station. Knowing that defeat was near, the H.I.V.E. Mistress refused to be taken alive. She murdered her Inner Circle then took her own life. With her demise, this incarnation of the H.I.V.E. was gone forever.\n\nThe second incarnation of the H.I.V.E. was established by Adeline Kane, Deathstroke's ex-wife. They were tracked down by Tartarus, led by Vandal Savage and made up of Gorilla Grodd, Lady Vic, Red Panzer, Siren, and Cheshire.\n\nThe H.I.V.E. is later seen as members of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains with the H.I.V.E. falling under the leadership of Queen Bee.\n\nFollowing the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" miniseries and the \"New 52\" reboot, the H.I.V.E. acronym was reimagined as Holistic Integration for Viral Equality. Additionally, the organization formed an uneasy alliance with Green Lantern villain Hector Hammond. They are led by a world class telepath named the H.I.V.E. Queen who is a zealous devotee of the alien Brainiac, claiming to be his \"daughter\". To the public, H.I.V.E. is a social media company that connects people to each other. However, their true goal is to kidnap humans with psychic powers and harness their energies in order to mentally enslave the world for Brainiac's return. Their criminal activities become publicly known following the Psi War storyline, when a roster of powerful telepaths clash in Metropolis. During the battle, their main headquarters located beneath Metropolis is destroyed and their entire plan thwarted.\n\nIn a flashback seen during the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, the H.I.V.E. were responsible for an act that turned S.T.A.R. Labs scientist Dr. Caitlin Snow into Killer Frost when she threatened their control of the energy market.\n\nH.I.V.E. is later featured in \"Red Hood/Arsenal\". A group of H.I.V.E. soldiers, led by the H.I.V.E. Regal, have planted a \"transubstantiation bomb\" aboard a U.S. Navy ship set to go off during a ceremony. Once the bomb goes off, it is supposed to release a psionic virus that will infect all the U.S. Military personnel present with the goals and ideals of H.I.V.E. However, Red Hood and Arsenal infiltrate the ship during the ceremony and Arsenal disables the bomb while Red Hood fights off the soldiers and kills the H.I.V.E. Regal.\n\nH.I.V.E. returns in Teen Titans Vol 4. During a trip to New Orleans, the city suddenly comes under psionic attack from the H.I.V.E. Queen who quickly seizes control of every mind in New Orleans except the Titans who are shielded by Raven's magic. The mind-controlled citizens then start building psionic amplifiers that will allow the Queen to expand her powers across the whole of the U.S. Managing to triangulate her location, Red Robin and Raven assault her base and defeat the H.I.V.E. Queen, freeing everyone from her mental control.\n\nAt some point in the \"DC Rebirth\" reboot, the H.I.V.E. are revealed to be the financial backers behind Meta Solutions, a company set up by the Fearsome Five. Its purpose was to steal the powers of metahumans and sell them to H.I.V.E. on the black market. The company was taken down and Fearsome Five are defeated by the Titans. H.I.V.E. is shown to have a history with the Titans and was revealed to have hired Deathstroke's son Grant Wilson. His assignment was to kill the Titans. To this end, they granted him various superhuman powers. However, the strain proved too much and he died of a heart attack before he could complete his mission.\n\nThere are different memberships in each incarnation. Here is a list of its known memberships:\n\n\n\n\nThe H.I.V.E.'s heroic counterparts in the antimatter universe in \"\" are known as the Hierarchy for International Virtuous Empowerment.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, the H.I.V.E. council members: Adeline Kane, August General in Iron, Captain Nazi, Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi, Impala, Naif al-Sheikh, Prince Osiris, Ra's al Ghul, and Red Star are taking a vote which will decide if they should be against using nuclear weapons to end the war in Western Europe between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Though the majority of them votes yes, they are stopped by Kane's daughter followed by Kane starting the attack alone.\n\n\n\nThe H.I.V.E. is featured in \"DC Universe Online\". They are shown to serve Queen Bee when they attack S.T.A.R. Labs and LexCorp Exobyte Transports near the Metropolis Metrodome. She and the H.I.V.E. are in cahoots with Brainiac in order to deliver the stolen Exobytes to him. The players fight the H.I.V.E. again when Queen Bee hypnotizes Booster Gold. The H.I.V.E.'s foot soldiers consist of H.I.V.E. Drones, H.I.V.E. Foragers, H.I.V.E. Killer Bees, H.I.V.E. Recruits, H.I.V.E. Royal Drones, H.I.V.E. Stingers, H.I.V.E.

The restaurant was founded by Harry Rosen in 1950, although his family had run a diner in that location, albeit not under the Junior's name, since 1929. The place is known for iconic New York-style cheesecake. According to the restaurant, it was named Junior's after Rosen's two sons, Walter and Marvin.\n\nAccording to \"GO Brooklyn\", \"At the corner of Flatbush and DeKalb avenues in Downtown Brooklyn, there has been a diner run by the Rosen family since 1929. In 1950, the name was changed to Junior's, and it has been serving its famous cheesecake and other goodies ever since.\"\n\nRosen worked with master baker Eigel Peterson to create the cheesecake known today as \"The World's Most Fabulous Cheesecake\", based on a recipe that was in the Rosen family for three generations. In addition to cheesecake, Junior's features deli sandwiches (particularly corned beef and pastrami), ten ounce steakburgers, cheese blintzes, and unique onion rings. \n\nFans of the restaurant are not limited to Brooklynites. A Kuwaiti prince was known to have taken several Junior's cheesecakes back with him. A shrine to the Brooklyn of old, Junior's has become a must-visit for politicians from borough presidents to President Barack Obama, who bought two cheesecakes and a couple of black-and-white cookies during an October 2013 visit with Bill de Blasio, who was soon to be elected mayor. In 2020, the \"New York Post\" revealed after reviewing the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings of Senator Chuck Schumer, that the Senate Minority Leader had spent US$8,600 on Junior's cheesecakes in a decade of purchases. Schumer admitted that he had spent a bundle over the years on Junior's cheesecakes calling them his \"guilty pleasure\". Holding a platter of the famous dessert at a news conference, he quipped: \"Guilty as charged. I love Junior's cheesecake so much. It's the best cheesecake in the world. It is made in Brooklyn. I've been going to Junior's since I've been a little boy.

Rosen received offers up to $45M, but that offer wouldn't accommodate Junior's on the ground floor. In September 2014 Rosen took the building off the market after deciding the existing building is Junior's identity.\n\nIn April 2015, Junior's announced it would move its baking operations from Queens to Burlington, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2016, the location inside Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan was closed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2033042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033042", "title": "Chu shogi", "text": "Chu shogi\n\nChu shogi (中将棋 \"chū shōgi\" or Middle Shogi) is a strategy board game native to Japan. It is similar to modern shogi (sometimes called Japanese chess) in its rules and gameplay. Its name means \"mid-sized shogi\", from a time when there were three sizes of shogi variants that were regularly being played. Chu shogi seems to have been developed in the early 14th century as a derivative of dai shogi (\"large shogi\"). There are earlier references, but it is not clear that they refer to the game as we now know it.\n\nWith fewer pieces than dai shogi, the game is considered more exciting, and was still commonly played in Japan in 1928–1939, especially in the Keihanshin region. The game largely died out after World War II despite the advocacy of prominent shogi players such as Fumiaki Okazaki and Ōyama Yasuharu (who played chu shogi when young and credited it with the development of his personal cautious and tenacious shogi style). In 1976, there were about 30–40 masters of the game. It has gained some adherents in the West, and still maintains a society (the \"Chushogi Renmei\", or Japanese Chu Shogi Association) and an online following in Japan.\n\nThe main reference work in English is the \"Middle Shogi Manual\" by George Hodges.\n\nThe objective of the game is to capture the opponent's king and, if present, the prince, which counts as a second king. These two pieces are called \"royal pieces\", as the game is lost when a player is left without any of them. Alternatively, under the rules of the Japanese Chu Shogi Association, it suffices to capture all the opponent's other pieces, leaving a bare king or a bare prince, whereupon the player wins and the game ends early, provided that one's own king is not immediately bared or captured on the next move. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after capture.\n\nTwo players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. (The pieces are not differentiated by color, but rather by facing of the pieces, with the \"sharp\" end pointed at the opponent; the traditional chess terms \"Black\" and \"White\" are only used to indicate who plays first, and to differentiate the sides during discussions of the game.) A \"move\" consists of moving a piece either to an empty square on the board or to a square occupied by an opposing piece, thus capturing that piece; and optionally of promoting the moving piece, if the move enters the \"promotion zone\", or if it is a capture and any part of it is in the promotion zone.\n\nTwo players, Black and White (or 先手 \"sente\" and 後手 \"gote),\" play on a board ruled into a grid of 12 \"ranks\" (rows) and 12 \"files\" (columns), with a total of 144 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color, unlike a Western chess board.\n\nEach player has a set of 46 pieces of 21 different types, and each piece has its name written on it in Japanese kanji. The writing is typically in black. On the reverse side of most pieces (i.e. except the king, queen, and lion) there are characters to indicate the piece's promoted rank, typically written in red. The pieces are wedge-shaped and their orientation indicates which player they belong to, as they point toward the opposing side. In all, the players must remember 28 moves for these pieces. The pieces are of slightly different sizes; from largest to smallest (most to least powerful) they are:\n\nListed below are the pieces of the game and, if they promote, the pieces they promote to. Names are rough translations that have become somewhat standardized in English. Pieces are listed alphabetically by their English name.\n\nThe promotions apply only to pieces which start out with the ranks in the left-most column, that is, pieces with these ranks written in black; promoted pieces with those same ranks written in red may not promote further. Pieces which only appear upon promotion, that is, names which only occur written in red, are marked with an asterisk. The king, queen, and lion do not promote.\n\nBelow is a diagram showing the setup of the players' pieces. The board setup is symmetrical: the way one player sees their own pieces is the same way that the opposing player sees their pieces.\n\nIn some contexts, one-letter abbreviations may be necessary. Those used in WinBoard are given in the second column of abbreviations.\nPromoted pieces are notated by a + in front of the symbol; thus a white horse is +L, and a promoted gold (now a rook) is +G.\n\nThe promotion zone is the 'enemy camp', the farthest four ranks of the board, which are mostly occupied by the opposing player's pieces when the board is first set up. When a promotable piece enters the promotion zone from outside, or makes a capture starting within the promotion zone, it has the option of \"promoting\" to a more powerful rank. Promotion is not mandatory, and in some cases it may be beneficial to leave the piece unpromoted. (For example, the pawn, gold general, silver general, copper general, ferocious leopard, phoenix, kirin, vertical mover, side mover, and go-between all lose some of their powers upon promoting, so that there may be immediate tactical reasons for deferral, even though they all gain much more than they lose.) Promotion is permanent and promoted pieces may not revert to their original rank, nor promote a second time. If a piece is not promoted upon entering the promotion zone, then it may not promote until it leaves the zone and reenters unless it makes a capture, with the exception of pawns (see below).\n\nPromotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promoting a piece has the effect of changing how that piece moves. See below. For example, promoting a kirin turns it into a lion, and thereafter it behaves exactly like the original lion, even for the lion-trading rules. (Which can be a reason to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon king), while the former cannot.\n\nIf a pawn reaches the furthest rank, it gets a second opportunity to promote on a non-capture. (This is because the pawn can never leave the zone, and there is a legitimate reason to defer its promotion: a pawn can stand between two protected lions without allowing either player to trade them, which is something a promoted pawn – a gold general – cannot do.) No such exception exists or is needed for lances (the only other piece with no backward moves) as there is never any reason to defer promotion of a lance in the first place: therefore, a lance that reaches the furthest rank without promoting becomes an immobile \"dead piece\" (死に駒). This last-rank promotion of pawns can likewise be declined, leaving the pawn as an immobile \"dead piece\". (Unlike for lances, this might still be done with reason, again because of the lion-trading rules.)\n\nAccording to Fumiaki Okazaki, the go-between can likewise promote on the furthest rank on a non-capture. In the past, the Japanese Chu Shogi Association used this rule, but later repealed it because the go-between can go backwards. Some of the new rules given by Okazaki and not present in the Edo-period texts seem to be late innovations in the history of chu shogi from the Showa period.\n\nAn opposing piece is captured by \"displacement\": That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece, that is, by another piece controlled by the moving player.\n\nEach piece on the game moves in a characteristic pattern. Pieces move either \"orthogonally\" (that is, forward, backward, left, or right, in the direction of one of the arms of a plus sign, +), or \"diagonally\" (in the direction of one of the arms of a multiplication sign, ×). The lion is the sole exception, in that it is not required to move in a straight line.\n\nAs stated earlier, this game is based on dai shogi and all of the pieces of this game can be found in dai shogi. The eight types of pieces that were removed were all rather weak and all promoted to gold generals. Furthermore, the larger board of dai shogi makes the slow-moving step movers even slower. All of this made for comparatively dull gameplay.\n\nMany pieces are capable of several kinds of movement, with the type of movement most often depending on the direction in which they move. The movement categories are:\n\nSome pieces move only one square at a time. If a friendly piece occupies an adjacent square, the moving piece may not move in that direction; if an opposing piece is there, it may be displaced and captured.\n\nThe step movers are the king, prince, drunk elephant, blind tigers, ferocious leopards, the generals, go-betweens, and the 12 pawns of each side. Only the king and prince can move in all eight directions. The king and prince are additionally considered royal pieces, as losing both of them loses the game. The Japanese Chu Shogi Association, in addition to separating out the king and prince, also considers the pawns and go-betweens as a separate class of \"pawns\" (歩), while the remaining step movers are called \"small pieces\" (小駒).\n\nSeveral pieces can \"jump\", that is, they can pass over any intervening piece, whether friend or foe, with no effect on either. These are the lion, the kirin, the phoenix, the horned falcon and the soaring eagle. Only the lion can jump in all directions.\n\nMany pieces can move any number of empty squares along a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, limited only by the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.\n\nThe ranging pieces are the queen, dragon king, dragon horse, rook, bishop, vertical mover, side mover, reverse chariot, lance, and all those pieces which do not appear in the initial setup except the prince. Only the queen can range along all eight directions. The Japanese Chu Shogi Association further divides them into greater (大走り駒) and lesser (走り駒) ranging pieces: the greater ranging pieces are the queen, horned falcon, and soaring eagle, and the remainder are lesser ranging pieces.\n\nThe lion has a double-capture ability, called a 'lion move', as to a lesser extent do the soaring eagle and horned falcon (promoted dragon king and dragon horse). The details of these powerful moves are described for the lion below.\n\nFollowing are diagrams that indicate the movement of each piece. Pieces are listed roughly in order, from front to back rows, with pieces making similar moves paired. Pieces with a grey heading start out in the game; those with a blue heading only appear on the board as a promoted piece. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation \"xxxayyyK stands for an \"xxxK move possibly followed by an \"yyy\"K move, not necessarily in the same direction. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' (\"vertical\", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Square brackets are used to make it clear what operators the a modifier chains together: thus DaK would denote a dabbaba move followed by a king move, but D[aK] would denote a piece that can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.\n\nBelow are eight examples of the lion-trading rules in action. In all examples below, the Black and White pieces are distinguished by colour, rather than their direction as they would be in a real game. (Black moves up the board.)\n\nIn principle a player may not make a move if the resulting position is one that has previously occurred in the game \"with the same player to move\". (This rule is usually relaxed without altering its effect, by only forbidding the 4th occurrence of any position, to allow for human error.) However, evidence from historical mating problems suggests that this prohibition does not apply to a player who is in check. Note that certain pieces have the ability to pass in certain situations (a lion, when at least one square immediately adjacent to it is unoccupied, a horned falcon, when the square immediately in front of it is unoccupied, and a soaring eagle, when one or both of the two squares immediately diagonally in front of it are unoccupied). (The lion, horned falcon, and soaring eagle can also be blocked from passing by the edge of the board.) Such a pass move leaves the position unchanged, but it does not violate the repetition rule, as it will now be the turn of the other player to move. Of course, two consecutive passes are not possible, as the first player will see the same position as before.\n\nThe Japanese Chu Shogi Association plays by more complex repetition rules. Only a fourth repetition is forbidden, and the burden to deviate is not necessarily on the player that reaches this first. If one side is making attacks with his moves in the repeat cycle, and the other is not, the attacking side must deviate, while in case of checking the checker must deviate regardless of whether the checked side attacks other pieces. In the case of consecutive passes, the side passing first must deviate, making turn passing to avoid zugzwang pointless if the opponent is in a position where he can pass his turn too.\n\nWhen a player makes a move such that the opponent's only remaining royal (king or prince) could be captured on the following move, the move is said to \"give check\"; the king or prince is said to be \"in check\". If a player's king or prince is in check and no legal move by that player will get it out of check, the checking move is also \"mate\", and effectively wins the game.\n\nUnlike Western chess, a player need not move out of check in chu shogi, and indeed may even move into check. Although obviously not often a good idea, a player with more than one royal may occasionally sacrifice one of these pieces as part of a gambit, or trade it for more capable pieces.\n\nA player is not allowed to give perpetual check. This is not a rule in itself, but arises from the repetition rule.\n\nA player who captures the opponent's sole remaining king or prince wins the game. Thus a player who is checkmated or stalemated will lose. This situation extends to \"smothered stalemates\" where the king's safety is not at issue, but no moves are possible: these also result in a loss for the stalemated player to move by the rules of \"The Chess Variant Pages\".\n\nAs an alternative, there is the \"bare king\" rule. A historic description of chu shogi mentions, \"When pieces are gone, and there are only the 2 kings, one can mate only if he has a promoted gold\". Nonetheless, this is only one specific case, and the motivation for such a rule is uncertain given that king and rook (a promoted gold) against king is an easy forced checkmate. The Japanese Chu-Shogi Association has altered this into a general baring rule similar to that of shatranj, where a bare king immediately loses against any other material, unless you can bare the opponent on the following move (in which case the game is a draw), or you can capture the opponent's sole remaining king or prince on the following move (in which case the opponent loses). This makes a difference in the endgames of king and pawn against king, or king and ferocious leopard against king, which cannot be won by the stronger side without the bare king rule (and also in some cases with blind tigers, silver generals, and copper generals that can be trapped by the enemy king when separated from their own kings). Further detail is offered in their standardised rules: king and any piece against king is an immediate win by the bare king rule, \"except\" if the piece is a pawn or go-between, in which case it must be promoted safely (to a gold general or drunk elephant respectively) before the win can be claimed. Furthermore, \"dead pieces\" do not count under this rule; a king and an immobile pawn or lance at the far rank against a king is still a draw.\n\nIn practice these winning conditions are rarely fulfilled, as a player will resign when checkmated, as otherwise when loss is inevitable.\n\nA player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games, and Hodges writing for a Western audience encourages players to do so.) Players can also agree to a draw at any time, or if the game reaches a position such that the winning condition is impossible to fulfill for either player (called 持将棋 \"jishōgi\", as in standard shogi). (In practice, positions that cannot be won without the other side making a very obvious blunder are also considered as \"jishōgi\", such as a king with only his lion blocked from getting near the enemy king by two side movers on adjacent ranks.) Under the historical rules, this means that no legal series of moves can lead to all of one player's royal pieces being captured; under the Japanese Chu Shogi Association's rules, this additionally means that no legal series of moves can lead to one player being left with only a king, or with no royal pieces. In professional play, drawn games are replayed with opposite colours.\n\nHodges reports a strict touch rule for chu shogi. Once a piece has been touched, then that piece must be moved. Furthermore, if the piece is also moved to a square, it must remain on that square without exception. (That is, the piece cannot be moved to a different square, even if one's hand does not leave the piece.) Thus, chu shogi's touch rule is more severe than the western chess touch-move rule used in tournament play. Under the rules of the Japanese Chu Shogi Association, if a piece is touched but it cannot move, there is no penalty for the first two times, but the opponent can declare a foul on the third time and result in forfeiture of the game.\n\nGames between players of disparate strengths are often played with handicaps. In a handicap game, one or more of White's pieces are removed from the setup—in exchange, White may move up a few of his pieces or rearrange them to fill in the gaps and protect the weaker pieces, and White plays first. Lions can also be handicapped by having Black's kirin promoted for a second lion, and, for a third, swapping Black's phoenix for White's kirin and promoting the latter.\n\nThe imbalance created by this method of handicapping is not as strong as it is in international chess because material advantage is not as powerful in chu shogi as it is in chess.\n\nThe handicaps detailed in the \"Middle Shogi Manual\", in increasing order of size, are as follows:\n\n\nOther handicaps may be used, such as Queen, Queen and Dragon King, or Two Kings (where the weaker player begins with the Drunk Elephant promoted).\n\nThe relationship between handicaps and differences in rank is not universally agreed upon. Colin Adams' suggestion is as follows:\n\nHe also suggests a grading system going downward from 20 \"kyū\" (beginner) to 1 \"kyū\", and then upward from 1 \"dan\" to 9 \"dan\".\n\nThe method used in English-language texts to express shogi moves was established by George Hodges in 1976 ('TSA notation') in the magazine \"Shogi.\" It is derived from the algebraic notation used for chess, but modifications have been made for chu shogi.\n\nA typical example is P-8f. The first one or two letters represents the piece moved (see setup above, except that Ky \"kylin\" is used for Kirin and FK \"free king\" for Queen). Promoted pieces have a + added in front of the letter, for example +P for a promoted pawn. The designation of the piece is followed by a symbol indicating the type of move: - for an ordinary move or x for a capture.\nNext is the designation for the square on which the piece lands. This consists of a number representing the file and a lowercase letter representing the rank, with 1a being the top right corner (as seen from Black's point of view) and 12l being the bottom left corner. (This method of designating squares is based on Japanese convention, which, however, uses Japanese numerals instead of letters. For example, the square 2c is denoted by 2三 in Japanese.)\n\nIf a move entitles the player to promote the piece, then a + is added to the end to signify that the promotion was taken, or an = to indicate that it was declined.\nFor example, Px7d= indicates a pawn capturing on 7d without promoting.\n\nIn cases where the above notation would be ambiguous, the designation of the start square is added after the designation for the piece in order to make clear which piece is meant.\n\nWhen a 'Lion', 'Horned Falcon' or 'Soaring Eagle' captures by 'igui' (that is, without moving), the square of the piece being captured is used instead of the destination square, and this is preceded by the symbol '!'. For example, a Lion on 8c capturing a piece on 9d by \"igui\" would be shown as Lnx!9d.\n\nWhen a piece makes a double capture with 'Lion' powers both captures are shown in the order that they were made. For example, a Lion on 3g, capturing a piece on 3h and then capturing another on 2i, would be represented by Lnx3hx2i.\n\nMoves are commonly numbered as in chess.\n\nWinBoard/XBoard uses non-easternised algebraic notation for the moves, differing mainly from TSA notation by using single-letter piece abbreviations, labeling the board files with the letters a–l from left to right, the board ranks with the numbers 1–12 from bottom to top, and omitting the hyphen separator between piece name and square coordinates. It reverses the names \"Black\" and \"White\" to conform to international chess. Thus it becomes White who moves first, and his king starts at f1; the Black king starts at g12. (In the TSA notation, these squares are 7l and 6a respectively.) Double moves are indicated by the same method as in TSA notation (e.g. +Dxf6-g7). Igui, however, has no special notation but is written as the back-and-forth double move it is, while a turn pass is written as -- and not associated with a particular piece. Absence of a promotion + suffix implies deferral. Some WinBoard versions use a more general notation for double moves, writing all legs as individual SAN moves, separating them by commas.\n\nOne modern variant of chu shogi, called Heisei chu shogi (平成中将棋), is played on a more open board. Forty percent of the pieces are set aside at setup and held in reserve, and once during the game a player may drop one of these on an empty square adjacent to a friendly piece. Captured pieces do not come back into play, and the rest of the game is played as in regular chu shogi.\n\nThe set-aside pieces are the lances, coppers, silvers, side movers, vertical movers, reverse chariots, kirin, and phoenix. As with dropped pieces in standard shogi, the piece may not be dropped on a square from where it cannot move (e.g. a lance in the far rank). If dropped into the promotion zone, the piece may promote immediately or on any subsequent move in the promotion zone.\n\nThe valuable long-range sliders have to be shielded from attack by the enemy's much less-valuable steppers by operating from behind your own steppers, or they would get quickly lost through fork attacks. As the steppers start on the back rank, they need to be developed before you can engage the opponent. This is usually done by pushing the Pawns one rank forward, creating a passage through the 3rd rank by moving up some of the sliders there, and walk Copper, Silver and Leopard to the 4th rank and beyond through the resulting corridor. One of the Side Movers is usually moved up to 4th rank, so that when your own camp empties as a result of launching your attack, the Side Movers prevent entry of the enemy Lion by controlling 3rd and 4th rank.\n\nThe King is usually protected by hiding it behind a wall on the 2nd rank built from the two Tigers and the Elephant. When standing shoulder to shoulder these pieces protect each other's blind spots, making the defense hold up against a lone Lion. An even stronger castle results from leaving the Golds diagonally protecting the outer-most pieces of the wall, although this has the obvious disadvantage that these Golds then cannot be used for attacking, or protecting the wings of your camp from infestation by enemy promoting pieces. There is no hurry in building the castle, as it will take a long time before the opponent can fight his way through all the material that is initially in front of your King.\n\nThe left and right board edge are controlled by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking out some of the opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.\n\nAccording to the German Chu Shogi Association, the average values of the pieces are:\n\nThese average values do not take into account the special status of the king and prince as royal pieces. They have also been normalized so that the pawn is worth 1 point to avoid fractions. Additionally, pieces gain in value if they have a good chance of promotion (particularly for the kirin, which promotes to the most powerful piece in the game).\n\nWayne Schmittberger adopts a different point of view, claiming that no such point values can be assigned, because most pieces can promote. Instead, he sorts the pieces, while grouping them by approximate value:\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Value varies greatly according to how close it is to promotion\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>But if the player has lost his or her king, the crown prince is priceless.\n\n() = promoted and cannot promote further; e.g. \"(bishop)\" = promoted ferocious leopard\n\nPieces that can slide forward promote far more easily than steppers or jumpers. As the board thins out their promotion becomes unavoidable, while steppers can almost always be met by an opponent stepper to neutralize it by the time it arrives at the promotion zone. The potential promotion gain of the sliders is thus always an important part of the material balance, but if it makes up too large a part of your total strength, you might be overwhelmed before you can develop this potential.\n\nParticularly significant are the phoenix and kirin, which promote to the two most powerful pieces in the game. They are best not used up in tactics, but kept until they get an opportunity to survive a promotion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2033089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033089", "title": "Dry rot", "text": "Dry rot\n\nDry rot is wood decay caused by certain species of fungi that digest parts of the wood which give the wood strength and stiffness. It was previously used to describe any decay of cured wood in ships and buildings by a fungus which resulted in a darkly colored deteriorated and cracked condition.\n\nThe life-cycle of dry rot can be broken down into four main stages. Dry rot begins as a microscopic spore which, in high enough concentrations, can resemble a fine orange dust. If the spores are subjected to sufficient moisture they will begin to grow fine white strands known as hyphae. As the hyphae germinate they will eventually form a large mass known as mycelium. The final stage is a fruiting body which pumps new spores out into the surrounding air.\n\nIn other fields, the term has been applied to the decay of crop plants by fungi. In health and safety, the term is used to describe the deterioration of rubber, for example the cracking of rubber hoses.\n\n\"Dry rot\" is the term given to brown rot decay caused by certain fungi that deteriorate timber in buildings and other wooden construction without an apparent source of moisture. The term is a misnomer because all wood decaying fungi need a minimum amount of moisture before decay begins. The decayed wood takes on a dark or browner crumbly appearance, with cubical like cracking or checking, that becomes brittle and can eventually crush the wood into powder. Chemically, wood attacked by dry rot fungi is decayed by the same process as other brown rot fungi. An outbreak of dry rot within a building can be an extremely serious infestation that is hard to eradicate, requiring drastic remedies to correct. Significant decay can cause instability and cause the structure to collapse.\n\nThe term \"dry rot\", or \"true dry rot\", refers to the decay of timbers from only certain species of fungi that are thought to provide their own source of moisture and nutrients to cause decay in otherwise relatively dry timber. However, there has been no published experimental evidence to support the phenomenon. In modern texts, the term 'dry rot' is used in reference to damage inflicted by either: \"Serpula lacrymans\" (formerly \"Merulius lacrymans\") predominantly in the United Kingdom and northern Europe; and/or \"Meruliporia incrassata\" (which has a number of synonyms, including \"Poria incrassata\" and \"Serpula incrassata\") in North America. Both species of fungi cause brown rot decay, preferentially removing cellulose and hemicellulose from the timber leaving a brittle matrix of modified lignin.\n\nThe term \"dry rot\" is somewhat misleading, as both species of fungi \"Serpula lacrymans\" and \"Meruliporia incrassata\" require an elevated moisture content to initiate an attack on timber (28–30%). Once established, the fungi can remain active in timber with a moisture content of more than 20%. At relative humidities below 86 percent, growth of \"Serpula lacrymans\" is inhibited, but it can stay dormant at relative humidities down to 76 percent. These relative humidities correspond to equilibrium moisture contents of wood of 19 and 15 percent, respectively.\n\nAn explanation of the term \"dry rot\" circles around boatyards periodically. In the age of wooden ships, boats were sometimes hauled for the winter and placed in sheds or dry dock for repair. The boats already had some amount of rot occurring in the wood members, but the wood cellular structure was full of water making it still function structurally. As the wood dried out, the cell walls would crumble. In other words, the wood was already rotten and as the boat dried, the wood collapsed and crumbled, causing the workers in the yard to determine it was \"dry rot\", when in fact, the wood had been rotten all along.\n\nSchilling & Jellison note the potential efficiency of these 'dry rot' fungi in growing away from direct moisture sources, although there is no reference for how efficient a brown rot fungus has to be at translocating water in order to be classed as 'dry rot'. Some have suggested the importance of these fungi providing their own source of nutrients as being more significant than providing an adequate source of moisture. Schilling suggests efficient nutrient translocation and utilization, notably nitrogen and iron, may be more distinctive in these species than water translocation. Water translocated in this fashion carries nutrients to the extremities of the organism; not, as is sometimes inferred, to simply render dry timber wet enough to attack. Coggins goes into more detail about water movement in \"Serpula lacrymans\".\n\nThe perpetual saturation of wood with water also inhibits dry rot, as does perpetual dryness.\n\n\"Dry rot\" would appear to be a paradoxical term seemingly indicating decay of a substance by a fungus without the presence of water. However, its historical usage dates back to the distinction between decay of cured wood in construction, i.e. dry wood, versus decay of wood in living or newly felled trees, i.e. wet wood.\n\n'Dry rot' is an 18th-century term that generally described what is now called brown rot. The term was used because the damage was present in cured or dried timber of ships and buildings and was thought to be caused by internal ‘fermentations’ rather than water. This contributes to the Etymological fallacy that dry rot requires less or no water than other species that use the brown rot decay mechanism.\n\nThe (London) Times on Tuesday 12 March 1793 carried an advertisement that informs the reader that the British Colour Company, No. 32, Walbrook, London continues to use, manufacture and sell paints prepared with the Oil of Coal, which is of a very penetrating nature, and hardens wood in an uncommon degree protecting it from weather, dry rot and ice.\n\nIn the early 19th century the rapid increase in instances of timber decay attributed to dry rot (brown rot) in the British naval fleet brought the term into wider usage. Thomas Wade's 'A Treatise on the Dry Rot in Timber' was published posthumously by the Navy Office in 1815 following his investigation of the matter in ships from various countries. The second was launched in 1810 and, when inspected, the timbers of the upper decks were found to be infected with 'the dry rot'. By 1816 the cost of repairs for this vessel had exceeded the ship's original construction cost.\n\nTexts published in the 19th and early 20th centuries also used the term to describe fungi which produced substantial (white colored) mycelium including;\"Antrodia (Fibroporia) vaillantii\".\n\nEventually, the term \"dry rot\" came to apply to only one or two fungi the main one being \"Serpula lacrymans\", in the majority of texts dealing with the subject, predominantly from the United Kingdom. This type of fungal decay subsequently also became known as 'true dry rot'. It has even been proposed to use the term \"water-conducting fungi\" in the category of \"brown rot\" rather than \"dry rot\". However, although the fungi such as these can transport water, it is disputed that it can use this water to increase the moisture content of otherwise dry wood. Whilst it may be disputed as the citation notes, the epithet 'lacrymans' is derived from the Latin word 'lacrymare', meaning 'to weep' and most surveyors of rotted buildings have noted the tear drops formed by the fungus as water forms on the hyphae. These water droplets are photographed in Rentokil's book \"Decay of Timber in Buildings\" Figure 24. There is, however, no evidence these small amounts of water on the hypae cause a significant increase in the moisture content of otherwise dry wood.\n\nDry rot can be very difficult to remediate unless all of the decayed wood and spores are removed. In some cases after this is done, decayed areas can be treated with special epoxy formulations that fill-in the channels of the damaged wood, killing the rot and improving structural integrity. However, this type of treatment can actually promote decay in wood in exterior service unless the epoxy application is designed to shed water. Epoxy or other polymers will trap moisture behind the patch, causing more decay in the surrounding previously uninfected zones unless the repaired zone is protected from recurring water events. Commercial ethylene glycol (commonly sold as antifreeze) and many other toxic diffusible compounds can diffuse into the wood to kill the fungus, but they also can diffuse out of wood that is repeated wetted. Diffusion of these toxic compounds out of the wood, and into surrounding soils and plants is not appropriate from a toxicity or environmental standpoint, and these types of treatment are not recommended for wood in-service. Certain copper compounds, such as copper naphthenate, are available as a brushable solution and are frequently used when dry-rot damage is repaired by splicing in new wood; after removal of bulk rotten wood the remaining original surface is saturated with such a compound (typically green in color) before application of the new wood.\n\nIn certain buildings, particularly those with solid 9 inch (or greater) brickwork and those built using lime mortar and flintstone, dry rot has been known to travel through and along the wall surface behind plaster and render. It is therefore recommended, by companies that sell this service, that where dry rot is found, plaster and wall coverings should be stripped back to a metre past the infestation in all directions and the whole area treated. However, given that dry rot attacks only wet timber, common sense should dictate that plaster need not be removed where there is no timber or any timber is dry (outside the zone of wetting that caused the outbreak). Identifying the source of water and allowing the affected timbers to dry will kill dry rot, as it is a fungus and requires water as all fungi do. This will not, however, kill any spores left behind, which will remain viable and cause the rot to return upon wetting.\n\n"}
