(), known as BMPS or just MPS, is an Italian bank. Tracing its history to a mount of piety founded in 1472 () and founded in its present form in 1624 (), it is the world's oldest or second oldest bank, depending on the definition, and the fourth largest Italian commercial and retail bank.\n\nIn 1995 the bank, then known as Monte dei Paschi di Siena, was transformed from a statutory corporation to a limited company called Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Banca MPS). The Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena was created to continue the charitable functions of the bank and to be, until the bailout in 2013, its largest single shareholder. Today Banca MPS has approximately 2,000 branches, 26,000 employees and 5.1 million customers in Italy, as well as branches and businesses abroad. A subsidiary, MPS Capital Services, handles corporate and investment banking.\n\nAccording to a research by Mediobanca and a press release by Banco BPM, Banco BPM overtook BMPS as the third largest commercial banking group in Italy in terms of total assets on 31 December 2016, after Banco BPM's formal formation on 1 January 2017. In 2016–17, BMPS was struggling to avoid a collapse, and was bailed out again by the Italian government in July 2017.\n\nOn 5 October 2018, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced the sale of its Belgian subsidiary, Banca Monte Paschi Belgio (BMPB) to a company participated by funds managed by Warburg Pincus. The sale price was set at €42 million, subject to an adjustment mechanism.\n\nBanca Monte dei Paschi di Siena traces its history to a mount of piety (\"monte di pietà\") founded by order of the Magistrature of the Republic of Siena on 4 March 1472, when its statute was approved. It is therefore often regarded as being the oldest bank in the world in continuous operation. The basis of its foundation is the \"Statuto dei Paschi\", written in 1419, a law that regulated all activities related to agriculture and pastoralism in Maremma.\n\nIts current form dates from 1624, when Siena was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and Grand Duke Ferdinando II granted to depositors of Monte, in their warranty, the income of the state-owned pastures of Maremma (the so-called \"Paschi\" which gave the bank its name). The bank consolidated and increased its banking activity during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWith the unification of Italy, the bank expanded its business throughout the Italian peninsula, initiating new activities, including mortgage loans, the first experience in Italy. MPS was also involved in the bail-out of Cassa di Risparmio di Prato, becoming the major shareholder.\n\nIn 1995, a decree of the Ministry of the Treasury of the Italian Republic dated 8 August 1995, gave rise to two institutions: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. and Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a non-profit organization with the statutory purpose of providing assistance, charity and social utility in the fields of education, science, health and art, especially with reference to the city and the province of Siena.\n\nOn 25 June 1999, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was listed successfully on the Italian Stock Exchange.\n\nAfter its debut on the Italian Stock Exchange, the bank began an intense phase of commercial and operational expansion. The bank acquired some regional banks: Banca Agricola Mantovana and Banca del Salento, while subsidiary Banca Toscana was absorbed. In 2003, the controlling interests (79%) of Cassa di Risparmio di Prato was sold to Banca Popolare di Vicenza in March 2003 for €411.2 million. The bank had also started a process to reinforce the structures of production in strategic market segments through the development of product companies:\n\n\nAt the same time, the bank upgraded its commercial productivity, with the aim of improving the level of assistance and consultancy to investors and businesses, and updated its activities in private banking and in private pension plans. At the conclusion of this plan of expansion, the bank implemented a vast program of opening new branches of the Group, with more than 2,000 branches. In order to finance this expansion model, the bank entered into some derivatives that were hidden: operations \"Santorini\" in 2002 and \"Alexandria\" in 2006.\n\nOn 8 November 2007, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced that it had reached an agreement with Banco Santander to buy Banca Antonveneta for €9 billion excluding the subsidiary Interbanca that is owned by the Spanish bank. Antonveneta is the bank that after the Bancopoli scandal was acquired by ABN AMRO and was supposed to go to Banco Santander after the purchase of the Dutch bank by the consortium of RBS, Santander, Fortis.\n\nFrom February 2007 to June 2008 Banca MPS sold all the shares (27.839%) in Finsoe, an intermediate holding company of Unipol Group, for €584.8 million. In 2008, Quadrifoglio Vita, a joint venture insurance company of Unipol and Banca Agricola Mantovana, was acquired by AXA from Unipol via Banca MPS, Banca Agricola Mantovana was also absorbed into Banca MPS.\n\nBanca MPS also acquired regional bank Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli from Intesa Sanpaolo in December 2007 for about €399 million.\n\nIn the wake of rising yields and declining valuations on Italian government debt in the European sovereign-debt crisis, MPS lost over $2 billion in the first half of 2012, had to recapitalize, and faced restructuring or worse. The majority owner until the recapitalization, the Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, long resisted issuing new capital which would dilute its holding. In September 2012, even after the dilution, the bank \"appear[ed] poised\" also to give the national government a greater ownership stake in return for more capital.\n\nIn December 2012, Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli was sold to Cassa di Risparmio di Asti for about €205.5 million.\n\nIn 2009, the Santorini and Alessandria operations began creating huge losses. In order to hide them in the bank's financial statements, the top management, including Giuseppe Mussari, the bank president, chose to enter into derivative contracts with Deutsche Bank and Nomura. This arrangement eventually led to prison sentences for 13 bank executives.\n\nEstimates of the losses accumulated by the Santorini and Alessandria operations in the period leading up to the derivative contracts range from €500 to €750 million.\nThe documentation concerning these operations was never communicated to the bank's own auditors or the Banca d'Italia. The derivative contracts and related documentation were discovered and made public by the new board of the bank at the end of November 2012. The documentation was then forwarded to the Banca d'Italia between December 2012 and mid-January 2013. The shareholders and the analysts have ascertained that the bank had not declared losses from derivatives. On 22 January 2013, the bank's shares lost 5.6% on the stock exchange and Mussari resigned as president of Associazione Bancaria Italiana.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, the scandal of the hidden derivatives was revealed. The bank's shares dropped 8.43% on the stock exchange that day, and another 8% the next day.\n\nOn 25 January 2013, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the bank was convened. They resolved to grant the Board of Directors the power to increase the share capital by a maximum amount of €4.5 billion to service the exercise of conversion rights of the bank of the Monti bonds. MPS called for an intervention of €3.9 billion, including €1.9 billion for the replacement of the previous Tremonti bonds.\n\nThe delegation of the extraordinary powers to the Board of Directors has also included the possibility of increasing the share capital of €2 billion at the exclusive service of the payment of interest payable in shares. The shareholders approved with a 98% vote in favour.\n\nAfter the vote, the bank recovered 11.36% on the stock exchange after having lost more than 20% of its value in three sessions in three days.\n\nOn 26 January 2013 the Banca d'Italia (Bank of Italy) approved a bailout request from the bank for €3.9 billion ($5.3 billion).\n\nThe firm sparked fresh controversy in 2013 when it was accused of misleading Italy's market regulator in October 2012, shortly before it received a 4.1-billion euro ($5.47 billion) state bailout.\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena rejected plans for issuing €3 billion worth of new shares, delaying the raising of capital until at least May 2014 and increasing the risk of nationalization.\n\nIn November 2019, after a three year trial, 13 former bank executives received prison sentences. The Monte dei Paschi ex-chairman and CEO received seven years each; two senior executives five and four years. Three bankers from Deutsche Bank received five years and two from Nomura received five and three years. They had conspired to hide Monte dei Pasche's losses of €2bn between 2008 and 2012 by using complicated derivative contracts. Deutsche Bank and Nomura were fined €160m; Monte dei Pasche had paid €10.6m after a plea bargain in 2016.\n\nIn March 2014, BlackRock declared a 5.748 percent stake in the bank (as the bank was still a constituent of stock market indices at that time, such as the FTSE MIB, fund managers held stakes in their index tracking funds, and were required to disclose stakes of 5% or higher). In July, the capital increase was completed, of which the banking foundation had just owned 2.500% shares. In October, the bank failed the ECB's stress test of major European banks, (first Comprehensive Assessment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) and was given two weeks to prepare a plan to raise €2.11 billion in capital. Despite issuing €5 billion in shares just four months earlier, the ECB declared the bank unable to withstand a financial catastrophe. Shares proceeded to drop 22%. In November, 2014, the bank reported a loss of €1.1497 billion in the 3rd quarter of the year. Eventually in 2014 financial year, the bank had a net loss of €5.3429 billion, resulting in the capital increase to be vaporized. The Tier 1 capital ratio of the bank was 8.7% as at 31 December 2014.\n\nOn 6 July 2015, following the Greek bailout referendum, trading in Monte dei Paschi shares was suspended after they fell 5.7%. Eventually Banca MPS achieved a net profit of €388 million in 2015. but mainly due to the effect of the restatement as a CDS derivative of the Alexandria transaction. The CET1 capital ratio of the bank was 12%, mainly due to another capital increase during the year, which the European Central Bank required Banca MPS to have a minimum of 10.75% from 31 December 2016 onward, or 10.2% in the transitional period. Moreover, both the gross (34%) and net non-performing loan to total loan ratio (22%) were still higher than the Italian average (18.1% in gross and 10.8% in net at December 2015) and the Italian average itself was higher than the European Union average.\n\nOn 21 January 2016 MPS securitized €1.6 billion performing lease receivables portfolio for a value of €1.4173 billion. The bank repurchased €656 million of the securities (tranches B to D) and sold €761.3 million of the securities to the market (tranche A).\n\nIn April 2016 German Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret commented that many Greek and Italian banks were zombie banks that were kept for political reasons. He urged that European Central Bank should deal with banks with high level of non-performing loans. However, he did not state specifically if BMPS was one of the zombie banks or not.\nOn 23 June a gross value of €290 million bad loan portfolio was disposed of without recourse to Kruk Group. On 4 July the bank confirmed that a request of reducing non-performing loans from European Central Bank was received. In 2015 the bank had €46.9 billion NPLs in gross and €24.2 billion in net. The bank targeted to reduce the gross NPLs to total loans ratio to 20% in 2018. However, this was still higher than the Italian average at 31 December 2015.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, 2016 European Union bank stress test was announced. Among the 51 banks in the test, BMPS was the only bank that CET1 ratio (in full Basel III basis) was forecast as negative in the adverse scenario in 2018. If setting CET1 Ratio and Total Capital Ratio (fully loaded basis) targets at 8% and 11.5% respectively even in the adverse scenario in 2018, it would mean the bank would have a capital shortfall of €8.8 billion (core tier 1, additional tier 1 and tier 2 capitals combined), according to European Central Bank publication on 29 December 2016.\n\nOn the same day, the plan to recapitalize the bank for €5 billion was announced; the bank also planned to securitize the entire bad loan portfolio for a target of €9.2 billion, which had a net book value of €10.2 billion as at 31 March 2016. The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed €1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for €1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for €1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market with some of them being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for €6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers. In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine tranche (for €1.171 billion) was added—to be underwritten by the bank itself.\n\nIn September 2016, CEO Fabrizio Viola and chairman Massimo Tononi resigned. They were replaced by Marco Morelli and Alessandro Falciai, respectively.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, every 100 BMPS shares were converted into one (1) new BMPS share\nand, on 2 December 2016, AXA and BMPS announced a renewal of their partnership bancassurance—an agreement intended to prevail until 2027.\n\nIn December 2016, BMPS successfully made debt-to-equity swap for part of their subordinated debt and Tier 1 capital instrument, for a maximum price of €24.9 per new share (on top of €5 billion new shares issue). In mid-December, BMPS reopened the offer for the swap, which reached approx. €2.451 billion. However, due to the failure to issue €5 billion new shares, the swap offer and disposal of NPLs were voided. Although J.P. Morgan, Mediobanca, Banco Santander, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs had signed a pre-underwriting agreement with BMPS in July. No banks and no anchor investor entered into contracts with BMPS.\n\nAt 01:20am, on 23 December 2016, the midnight after the failed recapitalisation, BMPS requested a precautionary recapitalisation by the Italian Government in order to bail out the bank by excising Article 32(4) of EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (The EU-wide banking resolution law, which restricted state aid to a mean of last resort). On 20 December the Italian Government had already raised €20 billion to set up a save-savings () fund in order to subscribe a possible recapitalisation of UniCredit, BMPS, Banca Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca and Banca Carige, as well as banks that need recapitalisation in the near future.\n\nIt was reported that the subordinate bond would be mandatorily converted to shares by the resolution authority of Italy (which is Bank of Italy) as a \"bail-in\". However, the bank had requested a Tier 2 subordinate capital instrument \"Fresh 2008\" excluded from such bail-in, as many investors were retail investors.\n\nOn 25 January 2017 BMPS issued bonds with €7 billion face value. The bonds would mature from 1 to 3 years, with the state guarantee from the aforementioned government fund. The bank said the bond would be sold to the market or used as a collateral in borrowing process.\n\nOn 3 February 2017 BMPS sold its card business to Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) for €520 million. Other leading banks of Italy, such as Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit had already sold their division in 2016.\n\nOn 9 February 2017 BMPS announced their 2016 financial results subject to the approval of general shareholders' meeting. The bank 2016 revenue, net interest income and pre-provision profit were decreased, compared to 2015. Combined with the write-down and provisions for NPLs, the net loss of the year was €3.380 billion. The CET1 ratio was reaching the legal minimal threshold of 8.0% (below ECB requirement in individual basis on the bank for 10.75%)\n\nOn 1 June 2017 European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager agreed in-principle for the state aid of the bank. On 5 July, the industrial plan of the bank was approved, which the bank would be re-capitalized for €8.1 billion, but only €3.9 billion would be underwritten by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (excluding additional shares that would be buyback from retail bondholders by the government), with the rest were the \"bail-in\" of bondholders, mandatorily converted the bond of the bank to shares.\n\nOn 29 July, the bank announced that the issue price of the new shares to the government was €6.49, with €8.65 for debt-to-equity shares.\n\nStefania Bariatti replaced her predecessor as chairperson of MPS during December 2017.\n\nMPS headquarters in the Palazzo Salimbeni in Siena hosts an art collection and a large number of priceless historical documents spanning the centuries of its existence. However, this collection is not usually open to the public. The most recent publicly known acquisition of art, a gold-plated panel by Segna di Bonaventura, cost the bank nearly one million Euro. It is also internationally known as the primary sponsor of Italian basketball club Mens Sana Basket of Siena, currently in Lega A and a regular participant in the Euroleague.\n\nIn 2010, the bank was funding the expansion of a small airport in the heart of the Tuscan countryside, Siena–Ampugnano Airport, to become an international airport. Both international and local groups had raised objections to this expansion on the grounds it would damage the natural beauty of the area, the environment and the attraction of the countryside to tourism. Eventually, Aeroporto di Siena S.p.A., the company incorporated for the project, was liquidated .\n\nUntil the euro-crisis, profits from the bank financed the Palio di Siena, Siena's historic-building renovations and \"biotech programs\" intended to turn the Tuscan plain into a research hub. Nearly all that money – $150 million a year, on average, from 1996 to 2010 – has \"evaporated\" since 2010.\n\nAccording to the annual report of the banking foundation, which acted as both the largest shareholders of the bank and the charity organization for Tuscan area, the foundation suffered a sharp decrease in revenue from the bank in 2009, which dropped from €340 million to just €62.5 million, thus affecting the endowment to other organizations. Along with other loss related and not related to the bank since 2010, the foundation had to suspend all the endowment to other organizations.\n\nMain shareholders of \"Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena\"\n\n\nThe share owned by Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena dropped from over 55% on 31 December 2009 to below CONSOB requirement to disclose (<2%) in 2015.\n\n\n"}

In 2019, Allen & Overy advised on more transactional deals than any other law firm in the world and was one of two firms to have surpassed the USD1 trillion mark in terms of deal value, totalling USD1.16 trillion. As of 2019, Allen & Overy is the world's 10th largest law firm by revenue.\n\nAllen & Overy was founded in the City of London on 1 January 1930 by George Allen and Thomas Overy, formerly partners at Roney & Co. The main purpose was to build a commercial practice. The firm's reputation was made as a result of George Allen's role as adviser to King Edward VIII during the abdication crisis of 1936. By the time the Second World War broke out in 1939, Allen & Overy had firmly established itself as a leading City law firm.\n\nOver the years, Allen & Overy has been involved in many developments in the legal field. Such work has included advising on the first hostile takeover in the City of London and acting for S. G. Warburg & Co. The firm arranged the first Eurobond (issued by Italian motorway group Autostrada) in the 1960s. The Eurobond transaction significantly diversified Allen & Overy's practice from a purely commercial into commercial and financial firm. Through the 1970s the firm's finance and corporate practice grew in the UK and internationally.\n\nIn 1996, non-UK clients contributed more to Allen & Overy's revenue than UK clients. In 1998, non-UK clients contributed two thirds of revenue.\n\nIn 1999, Allen & Overy hired a team of banking and finance lawyers in Paris from its then ally, Gide Loyrette Nouel.\n\nIn 2000, Allen & Overy merged with the Amsterdam, Brussels and Luxembourg offices of Loeff Claeys Verbeke.\n\nIn May 2004, the worldwide partnership of Allen & Overy converted to a limited liability partnership, Allen & Overy LLP, which works together with associated undertakings in some jurisdictions to form a worldwide legal practice.

{"id": "1795539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795539", "title": "Genelec", "text": "Genelec\n\nGenelec Oy is a manufacturer of active loudspeaker systems based in Iisalmi, Finland. It designs and produces products especially for professional studio recording, mixing and mastering applications, broadcast, and movie production. The company was co-founded by the late Ilpo Martikainen (1947–2017) and Topi Partanen in 1978.\n\nGenelec began operations to meet the needs of Finland's national public-broadcasting company YLE. YLE was building a new radio house in Pasila, Helsinki. Juhani Borenius, who worked for YLE as an acoustician, asked his friends at a postgraduate acoustics seminar if they could make an active monitoring speaker. Ilpo Martikainen and Topi Partanen had the first sample in two weeks. The prototype was promising enough to raise serious interest. In 1978, after two years of research and development, the company opened for business with their first speaker, the S30. The company moved immediately from Helsinki to Iisalmi, in the center of Finland. The first facilities were in Satamakatu, in the basement of an apartment building where Martikainen lived.\n\nThe first order went to RAI in Italy, the second to YLE in Finland. Four people worked for the company at the time, so YLE's order for 340 pieces gave work for one year. It also gave one year's time to explore other options to keep the company running. The company also began providing sound reinforcement contracting services.\n\nSound reinforcement contracting was half of the business. Genelec installed systems in many drama theatres in Finland—including the National Theatre, city theatres in Rovaniemi and Kuopio, the congress hall of the new cardiologic hospital in Moscow, the Moscow Circus, and two recording vans for YLE. The last contract job was Tampere Hall and the last audio system supplied went to the Royal Opera in Madrid.\n\nThe decision to quit the sound reinforcement business in 1989 was crucial for the future of Genelec. There was no financial need to leave contracting, but the company wanted to be known as a manufacturer.\n\nThere was high demand for Genelec speakers from the beginning, and production quantities grew every year, as did the number of employees. In 1981 Genelec delivered active monitors to ZDF’s new control rooms in Mainz. The facilities in Satamakatu became far too small. By 1981 the company had spread across different locations and searched for either a new factory or a lot where they could build one. In 1983, the town offered a lot next to lake Porovesi at Luuniemi. The company has expanded their facilities four times since then. In addition to production areas, the last expansion adds more room for training and quality listening.\n\nGenelec has exported speakers from their beginning, and has increased exports over the years. In 1980, they exported 20% of production, in 1984 80%, and on the 1990s exports peaked at 95% but have settled to around 90% in the 2000s. The first export countries were Italy, the Nordic countries, Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Great Britain. Cooperation with Otaritec Corp. in Japan began in 1986. In 1993, Genelec had distributors in 45 countries, and now has sales in more than 70 countries.\n\nAs the export trade has grown, the degree of domestic added value of the products has remained around 80%. The 77th AES convention in Hamburg in 1985 was a turning point for Genelec. They introduced the 1022A and displayed a whole family of speakers: Biamp 1019A mini monitor, broadcasting monitors S30 and 1022A, and music monitors 1024B and 1025A. By 1985, Genelec produced 12 models. They also made sound reinforcement and passive Hi-Fi speakers for the domestic market. The passive Biway 1050A and Triway 1051A were in production in 1980–1982 and production of the small 1049A\nbegan in 1988. They have long since discontinued production of passive hi-fi speakers.\n\nIn the 1990s, Genelec was increasingly known as a manufacturer of active monitoring speakers. They designed new products, notably the large control Room Monitors 1035A, 1034A and 1033A between 1988 and 1990. In 1991 Genelec designed the 1031A, which was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame in 2014. Genelec followed the 1031A with the 1030A, 1032A, 1029A, 1037A, and 1038A, and subwoofers 1091A, 1092A and 1094A.\n\nThe first years of the 21st century presented challenges. Genelec introduced the LSE-series of subwoofers and replaced most of the 2-way series with the new 8000 Series. The 8000 Series comprises four models (8020B, 8030A, 8040A and 8050A 2-way Active Loudspeakers), some of which are clearly smaller than their predecessors, which was obtained by using aluminium as the material of the speaker enclosures instead of traditional MDF. Renowned Finnish industrial designer Harri Koskinen designed the 8000 Series' appearance. Adding to the series are the smallest 6010A 2-way loudspeaker and its supporting 5040A Active Subwoofer, introduced in 2008.\n\nMany new Genelec products feature digital signal processing and software control. The 8200 DSP series adds three products to the line (8240A, 8250A 2-way and 8260A 3-way Active Loudspeakers) with ability to automatically adapt their performance to any acoustical conditions with AutoCal calibration through the GLM Software.\n\nAs of 2010, Genelec produced over 50 active loudspeaker models, and numerous modifications and versions of these for specific applications. They also produced software products for acoustic calibration. After finishing sound reinforcement contracting, Genelec concentrated solely on active speakers.\n\nStudio Monitors\n\nHome Speakers\n\nAV Installation Speakers\nLimited-production models are not included.

{"id": "1795548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795548", "title": "Bougival", "text": "Bougival\n\nBougival is a commune (or village) in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. Bougival is located from the center of Paris, in its western suburbs.\n\nAs the site where many of the French Masters (including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, and Auguste Renoir) painted country scenes along the Seine, the village today hosts a series of six historical placards, known as the \"Impressionists Walk,\" at locations from which the noted painters depicted the scenes of Bougival.\n\nBougival is also noted as the site of the Machine de Marly, a sprawling, complicated hydraulic pumping device that began supplying the massive quantity of water required by the fountains at Palace of Versailles in the late 17th century. Considered one of the foremost engineering accomplishments of its era, the cacophonous, breakdown-prone apparatus comprised fourteen waterwheels (approximately 38 feet in diameter) driven by the current of the Seine — in turn powering more than 250 pumps, delivering water up a 500-foot vertical rise through a series of pumping stations, holding tanks, reservoirs, pipes and mechanical linkages. In use until 1817, the machine was subsequently updated, replaced with another pumping building in 1858 and finally replaced by an electrical generator in 1963. The building itself remained until 1968. Remnants are visible today at the riverbank.\n\nIn Bougival, Georges Bizet composed the opera Carmen at his home at \"Rue Ivan Tourguenievf\" on the Seine and noted Russian novelist and playwright Ivan Turgenev built a datcha. A local monument commemorates the Montgolfier brothers, pioneers of flight. and the commune hosts the annual \"Festival of Bougival et des Coteaux de Seine.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, Bougival emerged as a fashionable suburb of Paris. Pauline Viardot had a villa there, as did her paramour Ivan Turgenev, who died in the town in 1883. Bougival was also known as the \"Cradle of Impressionism\" during the Belle Époque. Painters Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Sisley among others painted the light, sky, and water of this area. Alexandre Dumas, fils set parts of his novel \"The Lady of the Camellias\" in Bougival.\n\nThe Junior division of the British School of Paris (formerly the English School of Paris) was located in Bougival up until 2008. Prior to the English School, it was a Catholic all-girls school called Marymount in the 1960s. It was reported that the Germans occupied the estate during World War II, along with the nuns that lived there, due to the estate's vantage point of the Seine River.\nBougival is served by Bougival station on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line. This station is located at the border between the commune of Bougival and the commune of La Celle-Saint-Cloud, on the La Celle-Saint-Cloud side of the border.\n\nTwo multiple locks on the River Seine are located in Bougival.\n\nSchools in Bougival include:\n\nPublic preschools:\n\nPublic elementary schools:\n\nThere is a private school, Ecole privée Sainte-Thérèse/Collège privée Sainte Thérèse, that goes from preschool through junior high school level 3e.\n\nNearby public secondary schools:\n\nJunior high schools:\n\nSenior high schools/sixth form colleges:\n\nThe Bibliothèque Emile Richebourg is the community's public library.\n\nRennequin Sualem, inventor of the Marly Machine, died in Bougival in 1708. Ivan Turgenev died in Bougival in 1883, as well as Georges Bizet in 1875. Pauline Viardot made Bougival her home. Gabrielle d'Estrées had a château there (destroyed in the 19th century).\n\nThe town has since been home to noted residents including , Frank Alamo, Guillaume Depardieu, Jean-Louis Aubert, Michel Rocard, Flavie Flament, Laurent Garnier, Jean-Marie Hullot, Jean Michel Jarre, Benjamin Castaldi, Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (known as Neymar or Neymar Jr) and Gilbert Montagné have been residents of Bougival. Noted advertising pioneer Charles-Louis Havas lived in Bougival. Centennial Yvonne van Quickenborn, entrepreneur (STOP) and musician, spent the last 70 years of her life in Bougival.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795559", "title": "LGBT rights in the Czech Republic", "text": "LGBT rights in the Czech Republic\n\nThe Czech Republic is one of the most liberal Central European countries with regard to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights. In 2006, it legalized registered partnerships (Czech: \"registrované partnerství\") for same-sex couples and a law legalizing same-sex marriage is being considered by the Parliament as of 2019.\n\nCzech law bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Czech Republic is regarded as one of the most tolerant Central European and former Eastern Bloc nations with regard to homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Opinion polls have found increasing levels of support for same-sex marriage. A 2013 Pew Research Center poll showed that 80% of Czechs thought homosexuality should be accepted by society, one of the highest among the 39 countries surveyed. The capital city of Prague is famous internationally for its LGBT nightlife and openness.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity was decriminalized in 1962 after scientific research by Kurt Freund led to the conclusion that homosexual orientation may not be changed (see the History of penile plethysmograph). The age of consent was equalized in 1990 (to 15 – it had previously been 18 for homosexuals). The Army doesn't question the sexual orientation of soldiers, and allows homosexuals to serve openly. Homosexual prostitution was decriminalized in 1990.\n\nThere is legal recognition of same-sex couples. Since 2001, the Czech Republic has granted \"persons living in a common household\" inheritance and succession rights in housing, as well as hospital and prison visitation rights similar to married heterosexual couples.\n\nA bill legalizing registered partnership, with some of the rights of marriage, was rejected four times, in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2005. However, on 16 December 2005, a new registered partnership bill was passed by the Czech House of Representatives; it was adopted by the Senate on 26 January 2006, but later vetoed by President Václav Klaus. On 15 March 2006, the President's veto was overturned by the House of Representatives and the law came into force on 1 July 2006. Since this date, the Czech Republic has allowed registered partnerships for same-sex couples, with many of the rights of marriage (except for adoption rights, joint taxes, and the title marriage).\n\nOn 12 June 2018, a bill to legalise same-sex marriage, sponsored by 46 deputies, was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies. In response, three days later, a group of 37 deputies proposed a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. The bill allowing same-sex marriage requires a simple majority in the Chamber of Deputies, whereas constitutional amendments require 120 votes. On 22 June 2018, the Government announced its support for the same-sex marriage bill. A vote on the same-sex marriage bill was expected to take place in January 2019, but it was moved to March 2019, and postponed since then.\n\nSame-sex couples are currently unable to legally adopt. Single and lesbian couples do not have access to IVF treatments in the country.\n\nIn June 2016, the Constitutional Court struck down a ban which forbade people living in registered partnerships from adopting children as individuals. The Government announced its intention to repeal this law upon the pronouncement of the Constitutional Court. In October 2016, a proposal giving couples in registered partnerships the right to adopt their stepchildren was sent to Parliament. Jiří Dienstbier Jr., Minister of the Czech Republic for Human Rights and Equal Opportunities, said that \"It’s about securing that the other partner has a legal relationship with the child\". The bill died as it was not discussed before the 2017 Czech legislative election.\n\nAs of 2019, joint and stepchild adoption by same-sex couples remain illegal. They are being considered as part of a bill to legalise same-sex marriage introduced to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nIn 2009, a comprehensive anti-discrimination law was passed which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education, housing and access to goods and services. Section 2 of the \"Anti-Discrimination Act\" () defines \"direct discrimination\" as follows:\nThe first sex reassignment surgery in the country took place in 1942, when a transgender man subsequently changed his legal sex to male. Currently, 50-60 people undergo such surgeries annually in the country.\n\nIn order to be covered by health insurance, a request for change of gender markers and treatment is assessed by a commission at the Ministry of Health. After being approved, the applicant undergoes one year of hormonal treatment, which is followed by one year of living in the social role of the other gender, including e.g. wearing what is judged to be \"appropriate dress\". After this two-year treatment, the applicant's genitalia may be surgically changed.\n\nSince 1999, Czech law has prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in the military. Transgender people are allowed to serve openly as well.\n\nGay and bisexual men are allowed to donate blood in the Czech Republic following a one-year deferral period.\n\nIn a 1988 survey, 23% of those questioned considered homosexuality a deviation, while in a survey conducted in 1994 only 6% of those asked shared this opinion. Concerning registered partnerships, in a 1994 survey 60% of the respondents expressed themselves in favour of registered partnerships. An opinion poll conducted in 2002 showed 76% of respondents considered a law on registered partnerships to be needed. In 2004, public opinion showed a strong level of support for registered partnerships for same-sex couples, with 60% agreeing with such a law. A 2005 survey showed that 43% of Czechs personally knew someone gay or lesbian, 42% supported same-sex marriage and 62% supported registered partnerships, while only 18% supported same-sex adoption. In 2006, the Eurobarometer showed that 52% of Czechs supported full same-sex marriage (above the EU average of 44%) while 39% supported same-sex adoption. The 2015 Eurobarometer survey indicated a record high support of 57% among the Czechs, a five percent increase from the one in 2006.\nThe annual CVVM poll on gay rights has shown slightly lower, though increasing, levels of support:\n\nIn March 2012, a survey found that 23% of Czechs would not want to have gay or lesbian neighbours. This represented a significant drop from 2003, when 42% of Czechs said that they would not want to have gay or lesbian neighbours.\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Center opinion survey showed that 80% of Czechs believed homosexuality should be accepted by society, while 16% believed it should not. 84% of people between 18 and 29 believed it should be accepted, 87% of people between 30 and 49 and 72% of people over 50.\nA 2014 survey by the Academy of Sciences found that support for same-sex marriage had fallen slightly on previous years. In general, those opposing the extension of gay rights across the survey more frequently identified themselves as poor, left-leaning, pensioners and Roman Catholics.\n\nIn May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society's view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. The Czech Republic was ranked 18th, just above Austria and below Belgium, with a GHI score of 66.\n\nIn April 2019, according to a survey conducted by CVVM, 78% of Czechs would not mind having a gay or lesbian neighbor, a 3% increase from 2018.\n\nIn June 2019, according to a survey conducted between 4–14 May 2019 by CVVM, 48% of respondents said that homosexuality would not cause difficulties in coexistence with people in the city or community where they live, while 42% disagreed. Compared to 2008, this represented an increase of 11%. The same survey also found that 39% of Czechs have a gay or lesbian friend or acquaintance, whereas 50% do not have one and 11% \"don't know\". Compared to 2018, this represented a 5% increase.\n\nA Median poll, made public in January 2020, found that 67% of Czechs supported same-sex marriage. It also found that 78% of Czechs agreed that homosexuals and lesbians should be allowed to adopt their spouse's child, and 62% of Czechs supported full, joint adoption rights for same-sex couples. The poll showed that inhabitants of Bohemia were more likely to support LGBT rights than inhabitants of Moravia. It also revealed a large generational gap, with younger respondents overwhelmingly in support, but people aged 55 and above being mostly opposed. A gender gap was found as well, with women being more supportive of same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption than men.\n\nIn contrast to the limitations of the communist era, the Czech Republic has become socially relatively liberal since the Velvet Revolution in 1989 and is one of the most gay-friendly countries in the European Union. This increasing tolerance is probably helped by the low levels of religious belief in the country, particularly when compared to its neighbours Poland, Austria and Slovakia.\n\nThere is a comparatively large gay community in Prague, much less so in the rest of the country, with the capital acting as a magnet for the country's gay youth. The city has a large and well-developed gay nightlife scene, particularly centred around the district of Vinohrady, with at least 20 bars and clubs and 4 saunas. Gay venues are much more sparsely spread in other Czech towns, however.\n\nIn 2012, Fundamental Rights Agency performed a survey on discrimination among 93,000 LGBT people across the European Union. Compared to the EU average, the Czech Republic showed relatively positive results. However, the outcomes also showed that there is still large space for improvement for LGBT rights. 43% of Czech respondents indicated that none or only few of their family members knew about their sexual orientation. Only one in five respondents was open about their sexual orientation to all their colleagues or classmates. 71% of the respondents were selectively open about their orientation at work or school. 52% of gay men and 30% of lesbian women avoided holding hands in public outside of gay neighborhoods for fear of being assaulted, threatened or harassed.\n\nBrno hosts an annual gay and lesbian film festival, known as Mezipatra, with venues also in other cities. It has been held every November since 2000.\nIn the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, a gay festival took place in the country's second largest city of Brno. The first Prague Pride parade took place in August 2011 with official support from Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda and other politicians. The event attracted some negative responses from religious conservative groups and the far-right. The second Prague Pride parade took place in August 2012, establishing the tradition of holding the gay pride parade in Prague annually. However, a group of young Christians attempted to protest the parade with the support of the Catholic Archbishop of Prague, Dominik Duka. Since 2014, the organizers banned any promotional activities of pedophiles at the venues connected with the Prague Pride after several pedophiles drew public attention the preceding year by distributing leaflets stating that \"Pedophilia does not equal abuse of children\".\n\nLate 2010 saw the introduction of the first officially produced gay guide and map for the Czech capital which was produced by the Prague Information Service, under the aegis of Prague City Council.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795571", "title": "Calling convention", "text": "Calling convention\n\nIn computer science, a calling convention is an implementation-level (low-level) scheme for how subroutines receive parameters from their caller and how they return a result. Differences in various implementations include where parameters, return values, return addresses and scope links are placed (registers, stack or memory etc.), and how the tasks of preparing for a function call and restoring the environment afterward are divided between the caller and the callee.\n\nCalling conventions may be related to a particular programming language's evaluation strategy but most often are not considered part of it (or vice versa), as the evaluation strategy is usually defined on a higher abstraction level and seen as a part of the language rather than as a low-level implementation detail of a particular language's compiler.\n\nCalling conventions may differ in: \n\nIn some cases, differences also include the following:\n\nAlthough \"some\" languages actually may specify this partially in the programming language specification (or in some pivotal implementation), different implementations of such languages (i.e. different compilers) may typically still use various calling conventions, often selectable. Reasons for this are performance, frequent adaptation to the conventions of other popular languages (with or without technical reasons), and restrictions or conventions imposed by various \"platforms\" (combinations of CPU architectures and operating systems). \n\nCPU architectures always have more than one possible calling convention. With many general-purpose registers and other features, the potential number of calling conventions is large, although some architectures are formally specified to use only one calling convention, supplied by the architect.\n\nThe x86 architecture is used with many different calling conventions. Due to the small number of architectural registers, the x86 calling conventions mostly pass arguments on the stack, while the return value (or a pointer to it) is passed in a register. Some conventions use registers for the first few parameters, which may improve performance for short and simple leaf-routines very frequently invoked (i.e. routines that do not call other routines and do not have to be reentrant).\n\nExample call:\n\nTypical callee structure: (\"some or all (except ret) of the instructions below may be optimized away in simple procedures\")\n\ncalc:\nThe standard 32-bit ARM calling convention allocates the 15 general-purpose registers as:\n\n\nThe 16th register, r15, is the program counter.\n\nIf the type of value returned is too large to fit in r0 to r3, or whose size cannot be determined statically at compile time, then the caller must allocate space for that value at run time, and pass a pointer to that space in r0.\n\nSubroutines must preserve the contents of r4 to r11 and the stack pointer (perhaps by saving them to the stack in the function prologue, then using them as scratch space, then restoring them from the stack in the function epilogue). In particular, subroutines that call other subroutines \"must\" save the return address in the link register r14 to the stack before calling those other subroutines. However, such subroutines do not need to return that value to r14—they merely need to load that value into r15, the program counter, to return.\n\nThe ARM calling convention mandates using a full-descending stack.\n\nThis calling convention causes a \"typical\" ARM subroutine to:\n\nThe 64-bit ARM (AArch64) calling convention allocates the 31 general-purpose registers as:\n\n\nThe 32nd register, which serves as a stack pointer or as a zero register depending on the context, is referenced either as sp or xzr.\n\nAll registers starting with \"x\" have a corresponding 32-bit register prefixed with \"w\". Thus, a 32-bit x0 is called w0.\n\nThe PowerPC architecture has a large number of registers so most functions can pass all arguments in registers for \"single level\" calls. Additional arguments are passed on the stack, and space for register-based arguments is also always allocated on the stack as a convenience to the called function in case multi-level calls are used (recursive or otherwise) and the registers must be saved. This is also of use in variadic functions, such as codice_1, where the function's arguments need to be accessed as an array. A single calling convention is used for all procedural languages.\n\nThe most commonly used calling convention for 32 bit MIPS is the O32 ABI which passes the first four arguments to a function in the registers $a0-$a3; subsequent arguments are passed on the stack. Space on the stack is reserved for $a0-$a3 in case the callee needs to save its arguments, but the registers are not stored there by the caller. The return value is stored in register $v0; a second return value may be stored in $v1. The 64 bit N64 ABI allows for more arguments in registers for more efficient function calls when there are more than four parameters. There is also the N32 ABI which also allows for more arguments in registers. The return address when a function is called is stored in the $ra register automatically by use of the JAL (jump and link) or JALR (jump and link register) instructions.\n\nThe function prologue of a (non-leaf) MIPS subroutine pushes the return address (in $ra) to the stack.\n\nThe N32 and N64 ABIs pass the first eight arguments to a function in the registers $a0-$a7; subsequent arguments are passed on the stack. The return value (or a pointer to it) is stored in the registers $v0; a second return value may be stored in $v1. In both the N32 and N64 ABIs all registers are considered to be 64-bits wide.\n\nOn both O32 and N32/N64 the stack grows downwards, but the N32/N64 ABIs require 64-bit alignment for all stack entries. The frame pointer ($30) is optional and in practice rarely used except when the stack allocation in a function is determined at runtime, for example, by calling codice_2.\n\nFor N32 and N64, the return address is typically stored 8 bytes before the stack pointer although this may be optional.\n\nFor the N32 and N64 ABIs, a function must preserve the $S0-$s7 registers, the global pointer ($gp or $28), the stack pointer ($sp or $29) and the frame pointer ($30). The O32 ABI is the same except the calling function is required to save the $gp register instead of the called function.\n\nFor multi-threaded code, the thread local storage pointer is typically stored in special hardware register $29 and is accessed by using the mfhw (move from hardware) instruction. At least one vendor is known to store this information in the $k0 register which is normally reserved for kernel use, but this is not standard.\n\nThe $k0 and $k1 registers ($26–$27) are reserved for kernel use and should not be used by applications since these registers can be changed at any time by the kernel due to interrupts, context switches or other events.\n\nRegisters that are preserved across a call are registers that (by convention) will not be changed by a system call or procedure (function) call. For example, $s-registers must be saved to the stack by a procedure that needs to use them, and $sp and $fp are always incremented by constants, and decremented back after the procedure is done with them (and the memory they point to). By contrast, $ra is changed automatically by any normal function call (ones that use jal), and $t-registers must be saved by the program before any procedure call (if the program needs the values inside them after the call).\n\nThe userspace calling convention of position-independent code on Linux additionally requires that when a function is called the $t9 register must contain the address of that function. This convention dates back to the System V ABI supplement for MIPS.\n\nThe SPARC architecture, unlike most RISC architectures, is built on register windows. There are 24 accessible registers in each register window: 8 are the \"in\" registers (%i0-%i7), 8 are the \"local\" registers (%l0-%l7), and 8 are the \"out\" registers (%o0-%o7). The \"in\" registers are used to pass arguments to the function being called, and any additional arguments need to be pushed onto the stack. However, space is always allocated by the called function to handle a potential register window overflow, local variables, and (on 32-bit SPARC) returning a struct by value. To call a function, one places the arguments for the function to be called in the \"out\" registers; when the function is called, the \"out\" registers become the \"in\" registers and the called function accesses the arguments in its \"in\" registers. When the called function completes, it places the return value in the first \"in\" register, which becomes the first \"out\" register when the called function returns.\n\nThe System V ABI, which most modern Unix-like systems follow, passes the first six arguments in \"in\" registers %i0 through %i5, reserving %i6 for the frame pointer and %i7 for the return address.\n\nThe IBM System/360 is another architecture without a hardware stack. The examples below illustrate the calling convention used by OS/360 and successors prior to the introduction of 64-bit z/Architecture; other operating systems for System/360 might have different calling conventions.\n\nCalling program:\n\nCalled program:\n\nStandard entry sequence:\n\nStandard return sequence:\n\nNotes:\n\nIn the System/390 ABI and the z/Architecture ABI, used in Linux:\n\n\nThe most common calling convention for the Motorola 68000 series is:\n\n\nThe IBM 1130 was a small 16-bit word-addressable machine. It had only six registers plus condition indicators, and no stack. The registers are \"Instruction Address Register (IAR)\", \"Accumulator (ACC)\", \"Accumulator Extension (EXT)\", and three index registers X1–X3. The calling program is responsible for saving ACC, EXT, X1, and X2. There are two pseudo-operations for calling subroutines, codice_6 to code non-relocatable subroutines directly linked with the main program, and codice_7 to call relocatable library subroutines through a \"transfer vector\". Both pseudo-ops resolve to a \"Branch and Store IAR\" (codice_8) machine instruction that stores the address of the next instruction at its effective address (EA) and branches to EA+1.\n\nArguments follow the codice_8usually these are one-word addresses of argumentsthe called routine must know how many arguments to expect so that it can skip over them on return. Alternatively, arguments can be passed in registers. Function routines returned the result in ACC for real arguments, or in a memory location referred to as the \"Real Number Pseudo-Accumulator\" (FAC). Arguments and the return address were addressed using an offset to the IAR value stored in the first location of the subroutine.\n\nSubroutines in IBM 1130, CDC 6600 and PDP-8 (all three computers were introduced in 1965) store the return address in the first location of a subroutine.\n\nThis variability must be considered when combining modules written in multiple languages, or when calling operating system or library APIs from a language other than the one in which they are written; in these cases, special care must be taken to coordinate the calling conventions used by caller and callee. Even a program using a single programming language may use multiple calling conventions, either chosen by the compiler, for code optimization, or specified by the programmer.\n\nThreaded code places all the responsibility for setting up for and cleaning up after a function call on the called code. The calling code does nothing but list the subroutines to be called. This puts all the function setup and cleanup code in one place—the prolog and epilog of the function—rather than in the many places that function is called. This makes threaded code the most compact calling convention.\n\nThreaded code passes all arguments on the stack. All return values are returned on the stack. This makes naive implementations slower than calling conventions that keep more values in registers. However, threaded code implementations that cache several of the top stack values in registers—in particular, the return address—are usually faster than subroutine calling conventions that always push and pop the return address to the stack.\n\nThe default calling convention for programs written in the PL/I language passes all arguments by reference, although other conventions may optionally be specified. The arguments are handled differently for different compilers and platforms, but typically the argument addresses are passed via an argument list in memory. A final, hidden, address may be passed pointing to an area to contain the return value. Because of the wide variety of data types supported by PL/I a data descriptor may also be passed to define, for example, the lengths of character or bit strings, the dimension and bounds of arrays (dope vectors), or the layout and contents of a data structure. \"Dummy arguments\" are created for arguments which are constants or which do not agree with the type of argument the called procedure expects.\n\n"}

Existing buildings were to be demolished as the new accommodation was built.\n\nThe new high-rise block was designed to shield the site from an intended motorway (which eventually was never built). Construction materials for Byker Wall were relatively cheap, concrete, brick and timber. Surfaces were treated with bright colours, while brick bandings were used on the 'Wall' to indicate floor levels.\n\nIts Functionalist Romantic styling with textured, complex facades, colourful brick, wood and plastic panels, attention to context, and relatively low-rise construction represented a major break with the Brutalist high-rise architectural orthodoxy of the time.\n\nFollowing completion, fewer than 20% of the original local residents were housed at Byker Wall.\n\nRefurbishment of the whole estate was commenced in partnership with Your Homes Newcastle (YHN), the social housing arm of Newcastle City Council. The work was undertaken by Mansell, a division of Balfour Beatty. The work involved careful reinstatement of original features and colour schemes, using modernised materials where possible, while retaining the look and feel of the 1970s design scheme. For example, a new coloured aluminium window frame was designed to allow for improved security and insulation, without compromising the visual impact of the buildings. The most recent phase of this was completed in June 2008. A bid for PFI funding from the Homes and Communities Agency (to the value of £80 million) was sought in June 2009 to fund the project, which was estimated to cost £210 million, but was rejected as it did not meet the criteria; subsequent negotiations with the Department for Communities and Local Government led to the creation of the Byker Community Trust in 2012.\n\nA two-year refurbishment programme with a budget of £26 million began in April 2014. New roofs, doors and windows will be installed and the estate will be repainted in line with the original colour scheme.\n\nIn February 2019 local company JDDK were appointed to undertake further upgrades to the estate on a £4 million contract.\n\nThe Byker Community Trust (‘BCT’) was incorporated in September 2011 under the Industrial and Provident Society Act 1965 with charitable objectives. BCT is also a ‘registered provider’ of social housing.\n\nIn July 2012 a stock transfer from Newcastle City Council was completed and BCT became the owner of 1,800 properties. The creation of BCT has had the support of Newcastle City Council, the Homes and Communities Agency and English Heritage.\n\nIn 2013, Bolam Coyne won the Royal Institute Chartered Surveyors award for Best North East Regeneration Project of the Year.\n\nIn 2003 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced a proposal to award the Byker estate, of which the Wall forms a part, a Grade II listed rating as an example of outstanding architecture. In January 2007, the Estate became a grade II* listed building (grade two star).\n\nIts innovative and visionary design has earned it the Civic Trust Awards, the Eternit Award, the Ambrose Congreve Award for Housing (in 1980), and the Veronica Rudge Green Prize for Urban Design from Harvard University. The Wall has also been placed on UNESCO's list of outstanding twentieth century buildings.\n\nIn 1988 Byker Wall was featured in an episode of Building Sights presented by writer Beatrix Campbell, who compared the development to a pomegranate. \n\nThe Byker Wall was the home of \"Ratboy\", Anthony Kennedy, a juvenile delinquent who hid in its heating shafts when running from police during the 1990s.\n\n"}

It runs 670 km east from Owendo port station in Libreville to Franceville via numerous stations, the main ones being Ndjolé, Lopé, Booué, Lastoursville and Moanda.\n\nA railway was first planned in 1885. Investigations into the line were conducted in 1968, funding was agreed in 1973, and construction began the following year. The first section, from Owendo to Ndjolé, opened in 1978, with the remaining sections opening in stages until December 1986. Costs were well over budget and almost bankrupted the country.\n\nThe Trans-Gabon Railroad is overall adjacent the Ogooue River until Ndjolé. Most important constructions are the Juckville Tunnel, the viaduct over the Abanga swamp, and the bridge over the confluence between the Ogooue and the Ivindo Rivers.\n\nThe line to Franceville was completed in 1987.\n\nOriginally intended to reach Makokou and carry iron ore, its route was changed for political reasons, namely to keep within national borders manganese ore traffic from COMILOG that went on the COMILOG Cableway via the Republic of Congo. When the railway reached the manganese mine at Moanda, the Cableway was closed.\n\nThe railway was privatised in 1999. Plans regularly surface proposing an extension to Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo.\n\nBecause the line was built well into the era of earthmoving machinery, the need to choose a narrow gauge to save costs was no longer important. However the choice of standard gauge () took advantage of off the shelf equipment. It was constructed by a consortium of Impregilo, Astaldi, Philipp Holzmann, Constructions Et Entreprises Industrielles and Entreprise De Construction Franco-Africaine.\n\nFollowing the injection of sterling from the then P.M Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government, the discovery of uranium helped to secure British interest in the project. Many UK expatriates took the place of French workers and the building of the railway progressed rapidly from this point. Circa May 1983 CCI Eurotrag (a consortium of British, Italian and German interests) took over funding. British firms involved included Wimpey International, who seconded staff to Taylor Woodrow.\n\nThe initial building of 182kms from Owendo to Ndjole took over 10 years to complete. The remaining 400+kms took only 5 years.\n\nIn 2003 Hughes Network Systems (see Hughes Communications) installed a satellite based telephony system into all the railway stations of the railway.\n\nIn June 2006 a new line for iron ore from Belinga to port was announced. It is unclear if it will use part of the existing line. The track will be standard gauge. This line was supposed to open in 2012, but in 2014 completion is still awaited.\n\nTwo EMD JT42CWR locomotives shipped September 2011. A further 4 locomotives and 10 passenger coaches were also ordered.\n\nOn 18 May 2019 three workers were killed in an accident on the line.\n\nThere are no links with the adjacent states of Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, or the Republic of the Congo.\nThe railway is important for transporting timber and uranium in addition to being the only important public transport route in the nation. In 1996, the railway carried 3MT of freight and 190,000 passengers.\nThe Trans-Gabon Railway, has 23 stations.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795597", "title": "Acetone", "text": "Acetone\n\nAcetone, or propanone, is an organic compound with the formula (CH)CO. It is the simplest and smallest ketone. It is a colorless, volatile, flammable liquid with a characteristic odor.\n\nAcetone is miscible with water and serves as an important solvent in its own right, in industry, home, and laboratory. About 6.7 million tonnes were produced worldwide in 2010, mainly for use as a solvent and production of methyl methacrylate and bisphenol A. It is a common building block in organic chemistry. Familiar household uses of acetone are as the active ingredient in nail polish remover and as paint thinner. It has volatile organic compound (VOC) exempt status in the United States.\n\nAcetone is produced and disposed of in the human body through normal metabolic processes. It is normally present in blood and urine. People with diabetes produce it in larger amounts. Reproductive toxicity tests show that it has low potential to cause reproductive problems. Ketogenic diets that increase ketone bodies (acetone, β-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid) in the blood are used to counter epileptic attacks in infants and children who suffer from refractory epilepsy.\n\nAcetone was first produced by Andreas Libavius in 1606 by distillation of Lead(II) acetate.\nIn 1832, French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas and German chemist Justus von Liebig determined the empirical formula for acetone. In 1833, the French chemist Antoine Bussy named acetone by adding the suffix \"-one\" to the stem of the corresponding acid (viz, acetic acid). By 1852, English chemist Alexander William Williamson realized that acetone was methyl acetyl; the following year, the French chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt concurred. In 1865, the German chemist August Kekulé published the modern structural formula for acetone. Johann Josef Loschmidt had presented the structure of acetone in 1861, but his privately published booklet received little attention. During World War I, Chaim Weizmann developed the process for industrial production of acetone (Weizmann Process).\n\nIn 2010, the worldwide production capacity for acetone was estimated at 6.7 million tonnes per year. With 1.56 million tonnes per year, the United States had the highest production capacity, followed by Taiwan and mainland China. The largest producer of acetone is INEOS Phenol, owning 17% of the world's capacity, with also significant capacity (7–8%) by Mitsui, Sunoco and Shell in 2010. INEOS Phenol also owns the world's largest production site (420,000 tonnes/annum) in Beveren (Belgium). Spot price of acetone in summer 2011 was 1100–1250 USD/tonne in the United States.\n\nAcetone is produced directly or indirectly from propylene. Approximately 83% of acetone is produced via the cumene process; as a result, acetone production is tied to phenol production. In the cumene process, benzene is alkylated with propylene to produce cumene, which is oxidized by air to produce phenol and acetone:\nOther processes involve the direct oxidation of propylene (Wacker-Hoechst process), or the hydration of propylene to give 2-propanol, which is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to acetone.\n\nPreviously, acetone was produced by the dry distillation of acetates, for example calcium acetate in ketonic decarboxylation.\nAfter that time, during World War I, acetone was produced using acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation with \"Clostridium acetobutylicum\" bacteria, which was developed by Chaim Weizmann (later the first president of Israel) in order to help the British war effort, in the preparation of Cordite. This acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation was eventually abandoned when newer methods with better yields were found.\n\nLike most ketones, acetone exhibits the keto-enol tautomerism in which the nominal \"keto\" structure is in equilibrium with the \"enol\" structure . In acetone vapor at ambient temperature, only 0.00000024% of the molecules are in the enol form. Yet the enol form is chemically important in some chemical reactions.\n\nIn the presence of suitable catalysts, two acetone molecules also combine to form the compound diacetone alcohol , which on dehydration gives mesityl oxide . This product can further combine with another acetone molecule, with loss of another molecule of water, yielding phorone and other compounds.\n\nOne might expect acetone to also form polymers and (possibly cyclic) oligomers of two types. In one type, units could be acetone molecules linked by ether bridges derived by from the opening of the double bond, to give a polyketal-like (PKA) chain [––]. The other type could be obtained through repeated aldol condensation, with one molecule of water removed at each step, yielding a poly(methylacetylene) (PMA) chain [––].\n\nThe conversion of acetone to a polyketal (PKA) would be analogous to the formation of paraformaldehyde from formol, and of trithioacetone from thioacetone. In 1960, Kargin, Kabanov and others observed that the thermodynamics of this process in unfavorable for liquid acetone, so that it (unlike thioacetone and formol) is not expected to polymerize spontaneously, even with catalysts. However, they observed that the thermodynamics became favorable for crystalline solid acetone at the melting point (−96 °C). They claimed to have obtained such a polymer (a white elastic solid, soluble in acetone, stable for several hours at room temperature) by depositing vapor of acetone, with some magnesium as a catalyst, onto a very cold surface. \n\nIn 1962, Wasaburo Kawai reported the synthesis of a similar product, from liquid acetone cooled to −70 to -78 °C, using n-butyl lithium or triethylaluminium as catalysts. He claimed that the infrared absorption spectrum showed the presence of linkages but no groups. However, conflicting results were obtained later by other investigators.\n\nThe PMA type polymers of acetone would be equivalent to the product of polymerization of propyne, except for a keto end group.\n\nSmall amounts of acetone are produced in the body by the decarboxylation of ketone bodies. Certain dietary patterns, including prolonged fasting and high-fat low-carbohydrate dieting, can produce ketosis, in which acetone is formed in body tissue. Certain health conditions, such as alcoholism and diabetes, can produce ketoacidosis, uncontrollable ketosis that leads to a sharp, and potentially fatal, increase in the acidity of the blood. Since it is a byproduct of fermentation, acetone is a byproduct of the distillery industry.\n\nAcetone can be produced from the oxidation of ingested isopropanol, or from the spontaneous/enzymatic breakdown of acetoacetate (a ketone body) in ketotic individuals.\n\nAlthough some biochemistry textbooks and current research publications indicate that acetone cannot be metabolized, there is evidence to the contrary. It can then be metabolized either by CYP2E1 via methylglyoxal to -lactate and pyruvate, and ultimately glucose/energy, or by a different pathway via propylene glycol to pyruvate, lactate, acetate (usable for energy) and propionaldehyde.\n\nAbout a third of the world's acetone is used as a solvent, and a quarter is consumed as acetone cyanohydrin, a precursor to methyl methacrylate.\n\nAcetone is a good solvent for many plastics and some synthetic fibers. It is used for thinning polyester resin, cleaning tools used with it, and dissolving two-part epoxies and superglue before they harden. It is used as one of the volatile components of some paints and varnishes. As a heavy-duty degreaser, it is useful in the preparation of metal prior to painting or soldering, and to remove rosin flux after soldering, which helps to prevent the rusty bolt effect.\n\nAlthough itself flammable, acetone is used extensively as a solvent for the safe transportation and storage of acetylene, which cannot be safely pressurized as a pure compound. Vessels containing a porous material are first filled with acetone followed by acetylene, which dissolves into the acetone. One liter of acetone can dissolve around 250 liters of acetylene at a pressure of 10 bar.\n\nAcetone is used to synthesize methyl methacrylate. It begins with the initial conversion of acetone to acetone cyanohydrin:\nIn a subsequent step, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the unsaturated amide, which is esterified:\nThe third major use of acetone (about 20%) is synthesizing bisphenol A. Bisphenol A is a component of many polymers such as polycarbonates, polyurethanes, and epoxy resins. The synthesis involves the condensation of acetone with phenol:\nMany millions of kilograms of acetone are consumed in the production of the solvents methyl isobutyl alcohol and methyl isobutyl ketone. These products arise via an initial aldol condensation to give diacetone alcohol.\nCondensation with acetylene gives 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol, precursor to synthetic terpenes and terpenoids.\n\nIn the laboratory, acetone is used as a polar, aprotic solvent in a variety of organic reactions, such as S2 reactions. The use of acetone solvent is critical for the Jones oxidation. It does not form an azeotrope with water (see azeotrope tables). It is a common solvent for rinsing laboratory glassware because of its low cost and volatility. Despite its common use as a supposed drying agent, it is not effective except by bulk displacement and dilution. Acetone can be cooled with dry ice to −78 °C without freezing; acetone/dry ice baths are commonly used to conduct reactions at low temperatures. Acetone is fluorescent under ultraviolet light, and its vapor can be used as a fluorescent tracer in fluid flow experiments.\n\nAcetone is used to precipitate proteins. Alternatives for protein precipitation is trichloroacetic acid and ethanol.\n\nLow-grade acetone is also commonly used in academic laboratory settings as a glassware rinsing agent for removing residue and solids before a final wash. Acetone leaves a small amount of residue on a surface when dried that is harmful to surface samples.\n\nA mixture of acetone and dry ice is a popular cooling bath that maintains a temperature of −78 °C as long as there is some dry ice left. \n\nAcetone is used in the field of pathology to find lymph nodes in fatty tissues for tumor staging (such as looking for lymph nodes in the fat surrounding the intestines). This helps dissolve the fat, and hardens the nodes, making finding them easier.\n\nAcetone also used for destaining microscope slides of certain stains.\n\nAcetone is used as a solvent by the pharmaceutical industry and as a denaturant in denatured alcohol.\nAcetone is also present as an excipient in some pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nDermatologists use acetone with alcohol for acne treatments to chemically peel dry skin. Common agents used today for chemical peeling are salicylic acid, glycolic acid, 30% salicylic acid in ethanol, and trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Prior to chemexfoliation, the skin is cleaned and excess fat removed in a process called defatting. Acetone, Septisol, or a combination of these agents is commonly used in this process.\n\nAcetone has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects in animal models of epilepsy, in the absence of toxicity, when administered in millimolar concentrations. It has been hypothesized that the high-fat low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet used clinically to control drug-resistant epilepsy in children works by elevating acetone in the brain. Because of their higher energy requirements, children have higher acetone production than most adults – and the younger the child, the higher the expected production. This indicates that children are not uniquely susceptible to acetone exposure. External exposures are small compared to the exposures associated with the ketogenic diet.\n\nAcetone is often the primary component in cleaning agents such as nail polish and superglue removers. It will attack some plastics, however.\n\nMake-up artists use acetone to remove skin adhesive from the netting of wigs and mustaches by immersing the item in an acetone bath, then removing the softened glue residue with a stiff brush.\n\nAcetone is often used for vapor polishing of printing artifacts on 3D-printed models printed with ABS plastic. The technique, called acetone vapor bath smoothing, involves placing the printed part in a sealed chamber containing a small amount of acetone, and heating to around 80 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. This creates a vapor of acetone in the container. The acetone condenses evenly all over the part, causing the surface to soften and liquefy. Surface tension then smooths the semi-liquid plastic. When the part is removed from the chamber, the acetone component evaporates leaving a glassy-smooth part free of striation, patterning, and visible layer edges, common features in untreated 3D printed parts.\n\nThe most hazardous property of acetone is its extreme flammability. Acetone burns with tall yellow bright flames. At temperatures greater than acetone's flash point of , air mixtures of between 2.5% and 12.8% acetone, by volume, may explode or cause a flash fire. Vapors can flow along surfaces to distant ignition sources and flash back. Static discharge may also ignite acetone vapors, though acetone has a very high ignition initiation energy point and therefore accidental ignition is rare. Even pouring or spraying acetone over red-glowing coal will not ignite it, due to the high concentration of vapour and the cooling effect of evaporation of the liquid. It auto-ignites at . Auto-ignition temperature is also dependent upon the exposure time, thus at some tests it is quoted as 525 °C. Also, industrial acetone is likely to contain a small amount of water which also inhibits ignition.\n\nWhen oxidized, acetone forms acetone peroxide as a byproduct, which is a highly unstable, primary high explosive compound. It may be formed accidentally, e.g. when waste hydrogen peroxide is poured into waste solvent containing acetone. Due to its instability, it is rarely used, despite its simple chemical synthesis.\n\nAcetone has been studied extensively and is believed to exhibit only slight toxicity in normal use. There is no strong evidence of chronic health effects if basic precautions are followed. It is generally recognized to have low acute and chronic toxicity if ingested and/or inhaled. Acetone is not currently regarded as a carcinogen, a mutagenic chemical nor a concern for chronic neurotoxicity effects. \n\nAcetone can be found as an ingredient in a variety of consumer products ranging from cosmetics to processed and unprocessed foods. Acetone has been rated as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substance when present in beverages, baked foods, desserts, and preserves at concentrations ranging from 5 to 8 mg/L.\n\nAcetone is however an irritant, causing mild skin irritation and moderate to severe eye irritation. At high vapor concentrations, it may depress the central nervous system like many other solvents. In one documented case, ingestion of a substantial amount of acetone led to systemic toxicity, although the patient eventually fully recovered. Some sources estimate LD for human ingestion at 0.621 g/kg. Acute toxicity for mice by ingestion (LD) is 3 g/kg, and by inhalation (LC) is 44 g/m over 4 hours.\n\nIn 1995, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed acetone from the list of \"toxic chemicals\" maintained under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA). In making that decision, EPA conducted an extensive review of the available toxicity data on acetone and found that acetone \"exhibits acute toxicity only at levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures\", and further that acetone \"exhibits low toxicity in chronic studies\".\n\nAlthough acetone occurs naturally in the environment in plants, trees, volcanic gases, forest fires, and as a product of the breakdown of body fat, the majority of the acetone released into the environment is of industrial origin. Acetone evaporates rapidly, even from water and soil. Once in the atmosphere, it has a 22-day half-life and is degraded by UV light via photolysis (primarily into methane and ethane.) Consumption by microorganisms contributes to the dissipation of acetone in soil, animals, or waterways. \n\nThe LD of acetone for fish is 8.3 g/L of water (or about 1%) over 96 hours, and its environmental half-life in water is about 1 to 10 days. Acetone may pose a significant risk of oxygen depletion in aquatic systems due to the microbial consumption.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the \"Philae\" lander on comet 67P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate, and propionaldehyde.\n\n"}

State laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia and of the U.S. territories) vary considerably, and are independent of existing federal firearms laws, although they are sometimes broader or more limited in scope than the federal laws.\n\nState level laws vary significantly in their form, content, and level of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in \"McDonald v. Chicago\" that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.\n\nFirearm owners are subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not exclusively their state of residence. Reciprocity between states exists in certain situations, such as with regard to concealed carry permits. These are recognized on a state-by-state basis. For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so it is important to understand the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun.\n\nIn many cases, state firearms laws can be considerably less restrictive than federal firearms laws. This does not confer any \"de jure\" immunity against prosecution for violations of the federal laws. However, state and local police departments are not legally obligated to enforce federal gun law as per the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \"Printz v.

{"id": "1795607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795607", "title": "Neil Webb", "text": "Neil Webb\n\nNeil John Webb (born 30 July 1963 in Reading, Berkshire) is an English former footballer and television pundit. He played as a midfielder but could also play as a defender between 1980 and 1997 notably for Portsmouth, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Webb also played for Reading, Swindon Town, Grimsby Town, Aldershot Town and Hong Kong side Instant-Dict.\n\nWebb joined Reading on leaving Little Heath School in 1979 and made his first-team debut in February 1980 at the age of 16. He became the youngest ever scorer for the Berkshire side when he found the net in a Third Division match at the beginning of the 1980-81 season.\n\nIn July 1982 he transferred to Portsmouth for £87,500. At Fratton Park he was a regular first-team player and helped them win promotion to the Second Division (as Third Division champions) in his first season, and in his third season they came close to reaching the First Division. He scored a total of 34 league goals in three seasons at Fratton Park.\n\nIn June 1985, Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough paid Portsmouth £250,000 for Webb, which took him into the First Division for the first time. At Forest he developed into a leading midfielder with a strong goalscoring record. During his time at the City Ground, he won the League Cup in 1989 (scoring in the final against Luton) and became a regular member of the England national team from 1987. Webb was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in April 1989.\n\nHis goalscoring record at Forest exceeded that of many strikers at the time. He managed 14 league goals in both of his first two seasons at the club, in 1986–87 from just 32 games. This included a hat-trick against Chelsea in September 1986 that sent him to the top of the League's scoring charts. He scored 13 times in the 1987–88 league campaign, though his goalscoring totally was lower in 1988–89 (six goals from 30 games) it did nothing to diminish his reputation as a first class midfielder. He scored for Forest against Luton Town in the 1989 Football League Cup Final which they went on to win.\n\nIn July 1989 he joined Manchester United. The transfer fee of £1.5 million was determined by a transfer tribunal (Forest manager Brian Clough, reluctant for Webb to leave, offered to pay this to keep him). Webb scored on his league debut on 19 August 1989, when they achieved a 4–1 home win over defending league champions Arsenal on the opening day of the 1989–90 season.\n\nHe joined United at a time when they were entering their fourth season under the management of Alex Ferguson, but had yet to win a major trophy under him in spite of heavy spending on new players – with Webb arriving around the same time as Danny Wallace, Mike Phelan and Gary Pallister.\n\nAfter just a few games at United, Webb snapped his achilles tendon while playing a match for England against Sweden in September 1989. Webb made his comeback for United as a substitute against Southampton on 24 March 1990, and made his first start since the injury the following Saturday, at home to Coventry City. Despite positive early indications - Reuters called him the \"most influential player on the pitch\" during a September 1990 clash with Luton Town - he never fully regained his pre-injury form, suffering from weight problems and other injuries. Webb was still a precise passer of the ball and was included in the England 1990 World Cup squad, having return to action during the second half of the 1989–90 season. He also helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in 1990, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and Football League Cup in 1992.\n\nIn the 1990 FA Cup final, he memorably hit a clinical 50-yard pass to Lee Martin who subsequently scored the winning goal in the FA Cup Final replay.\n\nHe played in 31 out of 42 First Division games for Manchester United in 1991–92, but missed the final few games of the season due to a rift with manager Alex Ferguson – some fans even blamed United's failure to win the league title that season on Webb. He famously dawdled off the pitch after being subbed in a 2-1 home defeat to Forest during the season's final stages. He was also faced with stiff competition for a place in the centre or on the right of midfield - as well as Bryan Robson and three midfielders who had joined United in 1989, he was now faced with competition from Soviet winger Andrei Kanchelskis.\n\nWebb only played one game for United in the new FA Premier League, and after months of media reports that he would be on his way out of Old Trafford, he finally left three months into the 1992-93 season.\n\nAfter three years with Manchester United, he returned to Nottingham Forest for £800,000 on 23 November 1992. His second spell at Forest was unsuccessful, as he could not win a regular first-team place because of the emergence of other players like Steve Stone and Lars Bohinen. He made just nine league appearances in 1992–93 as Forest were relegated, but when manager Brian Clough retired and was succeeded by Frank Clark, he had more first team opportunities, playing 21 league games and scoring three goals as Forest were promoted back to the Premier League as Division One runners-up.\n\nWebb never played league football for Forest again after the 1994 promotion, though he remained contracted to the club for another two years.\n\nHe had a spell on loan back at Reading in the 1995–96 season before finally leaving Forest for good in the summer of 1996.\n\nHe signed for Grimsby Town before leaving shortly after the start of the 1996-97 season, ending his professional career at the age of 33. He then joined non-league Aldershot Town where he made 36 appearances and scored 6 goals in the Isthmian League, before joining Weymouth as player-coach in 1997.\n\nIn a 2005 vote to compile the Royals' best-ever eleven, Webb was voted on the team in central midfield.\n\nAfter excelling in his first two seasons of top flight football with Nottingham Forest, Webb earned recognition from England manager Bobby Robson, who selected him in the Football League XI for an exhibition match against a Rest of the World XI, on 8 August 1987. The match was in recognition of the League's centenary. Webb started the game, and was replaced by Osvaldo Ardiles. Webb was praised by \"The Glasgow Herald\", who stated \"the performance of Webb was outstanding\", adding that he \"frequently showed a sweet combination of close control and confidence\" and predicting full England honours in the offing.\n\nRobson gave Webb his full international début, against West Germany on 9 September 1987 at the age of 24, becoming the 1,000th player to be capped by England. His first goal came against Turkey on 14 October that year, in an 8–0 victory at Wembley in a Euro 88 qualifier. He appeared in two of England's group games at Euro 88 (which all ended in defeat), but his next international appearance – against Denmark in a friendly on 14 September 1988 – he scored the only goal in the game at Wembley. On 3 June 1989, he scored the third international goal of his career with a 3–0 World Cup qualifier victory over Poland, again at Wembley. On 24 April 1990 Webb made his first appearance with the England B team, playing in the 2–0 win over the Czechoslovakia B team at Roker Park. Despite missing the bulk of the 1989–90 season at Manchester United with injury, he was included in England's 1990 World Cup squad and made his solitary appearance of the competition in the third place playoff defeat by Italy. Before the year was out he would become the first player to be sent off whilst on England duty in three years when he saw red for the England B team in a match against the full Algeria team. On 12 May 1992, he scored what would be his final goal for England in a 1–0 friendly win over Hungary in Budapest. He would make four more international appearances for England, the last coming on 17 June 1992 when England lost 2–1 to hosts Sweden in their final Euro 92 group game. Webb was capped 26 times in five years for the England team, and scored 4 goals.\n\nAfter having to give up playing football, from June to December 1997 he was player-coach of Southern League Southern Division side Weymouth, but quit after just 70 days. His next spell in management with non-league Reading Town in 2001 was also short-lived.\n\nAfter Webb left Reading, he could occasionally be found selling programmes at Reading's Madejski Stadium. He became a postman and was featured in the Observer Sport Supplement in a \"Where Are They Now?\" feature and is currently working for a transport company. He is also a regular guest on Talksport.\n\nHe also worked with The Score Television Network in Canada as their English football correspondent for their \"Sportsworld\" and \"Footy Show\" programs. He was on every Sunday, giving his opinion on the happenings of the Premier League and the world of football.\n\nWebb's ex-wife Shelley Webb became a TV presenter, becoming a real footballers' wives interviewee, and then wrote the book called \"Footballers' Wives\". The couple have two sons, Luke and Josh, who both play football; Luke was most recently with Hereford United before being released, and Josh was with Walton and Hersham. Luke previously played with Arsenal Under-18s and Josh with Reading's youth teams.\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nManchester United\n"}
{"id": "1795619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795619", "title": "LGBT rights in Hungary", "text": "LGBT rights in Hungary\n\nLGBT people in Hungary may face legal and social challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Homosexuality is legal in Hungary for both men and women. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is banned in the country. However, households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for all of the same legal rights available to opposite-sex married couples. Registered partnership for same-sex couples was legalized in 2009, but same-sex marriage is banned.The Hungarian government has passed legislation that restricted civil rights on LGBT Hungarians (such as ending legal recognition of transgender Hungarians) and continues to deteriorate under his government.\n\nThe first Hungarian Penal Code by Károly Csemegi (1878) punished homosexuality between men (\"természet elleni fajtalanság\" – \"perversion against nature (nature's law)\") with prison up to 1 year. Homosexual activity above the age of 20 was decriminalized in 1961, then above the age of 18 in 1978 by the new Penal Code. The age of consent, which is 14, has applied equally to heterosexual and homosexual activity since a Constitutional Court decision of 2002. Gay and bisexual people are not banned from military service.\n\nUnregistered cohabitation has been recognised since 1996. It applies to any couple living together in an economic and sexual relationship (common-law marriage), including same-sex couples. No official registration is required. The law gives some specified rights and benefits to two persons living together. Unregistered cohabitation is defined in the Civil Code as \"when two persons are living together outside of wedlock in an emotional and financial community in the same household, provided that neither of them is engaged in wedlock or partnership with another person, registered or otherwise, and that they are not related in direct line, and they are not siblings.\" Inheritance is possible only with testament, widow-pension is available for couples cohabiting for more than 10 years.\n\nOn 17 December 2007, the Parliament adopted a registered partnership bill submitted by the Hungarian Socialist Party-Alliance of Free Democrats Government. The bill was found unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court because it duplicated the institution of marriage for opposite-sex couples. In February 2009, the Parliament approval a modified version of the bill. Since 1 July 2009, same-sex couples can enter into registered partnerships. The law gives the same rights to registered partners as to spouses except for adoption, assisted reproduction or taking a surname.\n\nOn 1 January 2012, a new constitution, enacted by the Parliament in 2011, came into effect, restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples and containing no guarantees of protection from discrimination on account of sexual orientation. Note, however, that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation remains banned through interpretation of the general non-discrimination provision in the Constitution, as well as by the \"Equal Treatment Act\".\n\nAlthough same-sex couples cannot adopt jointly, adoption by individuals is legal regardless of sexual orientation or partnership status. Stepchild adoption is only available for married (different-sex) couples.\n\nAccess to IVF and donor insemination is available for single women regardless of sexual orientation, but not available for lesbians cohabiting or in a registered partnership with their same-sex partners.\n\nIn November 2017, the Hungarian Ombudsman found that the rejection of a lesbian couple's adoption application was \"an infringement on the child's right to protection and care, and amounted to unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation.\" As joint adoption for same-sex couples isn't legal in Hungary, the couple decided that one of the partners would legally adopt the child. The couple was, however, very open about their relationship and were found suitable to adopt. During the following months, the couple took care of a 16-month-old girl, but later child protection service stopped the application procedure due to the couple's sexual orientation. This decision disrupted the life of the child, as she would not eat properly anymore and had to be taken to a child psychologist. The couple appealed to the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights (the Ombudsman responsible for the rights of children, nationalities in Hungary, vulnerable social groups and the interests of future generations), who found the child protection service's rejection of the couple unlawful and discriminatory. The Commissioner said that \"a person wishing to adopt has no right to adopt a particular child, but s/he does have the right to equal treatment and equality before the law in the procedure.\" The Commissioner based their decision on the 2008 \"E.B. v. France\" case, in which the European Court of Human Rights ruled that one's sexual orientation should not be a factor in adoption cases.\n\nIn 2000, the Constitutional Court recognized that the constitutional ban on discrimination based on \"other status\" covers sexual orientation as well. The \"Act on Public Health\" has banned sexual orientation-related discrimination in health services since 1997 and gender identity-related discrimination since 2004. The \"2003 Act on Equal Treatment and the Promotion of Equal Opportunities\" (), which took effect in January 2004, forbids discrimination based on factors that include sexual orientation and gender identity in the fields of employment, education, housing, health, and access to goods and services. Article 8 of the Act states as follows:\nAdditionally, Hungarian law prohibits hate crimes and hate speeches on the basis of one's sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn December 2017, a government decree was published, establishing for the first time a legal basis for gender transitions. Since 1 January 2018, transgender people living in Hungary have been able to change their legal gender. They require a diagnosis from a medical professional, but do not have to undergo hormone therapy, sterilization or sex reassignment surgery. The \"Equal Treatment Act\" specifically includes \"sexual identity\" among the list of protected characteristics.\n\nHowever, Transvanilla reports the government has refused to honor applications of the legal gender change since 2018. In 2019, a joint case of 23 people was created and submitted to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nFollowing the coronavirus lockdown of 2020, Viktor Orbán was enabled to rule by decree following an emergency powers act. On 31 March, the Transgender Day of Visibility, a bill was submitted that introduced the term \"gender at birth\", defined as \"the biological sex determined by primary sexual characteristics and chromosomes,\" to replace the term \"gender\" in the official registry. Parliament voted in favor of the bill on 19 May 2020, making it impossible for individuals to change their legal gender. The vote was 134 yes, 56 no, and 4 abstentions. Dunja Mijatović, commissioner for human rights in the Council of Europe, stated it \"contravenes human rights standards and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights\".\n\nConversion therapy has a negative effect on the lives of LGBT people, and can lead to low self-esteem, depression and suicide ideation. The practice is regarded as pseudoscience by the scientific community.\n\nIn February 2019, on the occasion of a conference on LGBT rights in Budapest, \"experts\" in a TV show on the M5 channel promoted conversion therapy and spent 45 minutes discussing how people could supposedly change their sexual orientation, despite the pressure of the \"gay lobby\".\n\nGay and bisexual men were allowed to donate blood following a 12-month deferral period. In 2020, this deferral period was scrapped, with individualised risk assessment introduced.\n\nHungary was the host country of Mr Gay Europe 2007 contest and the EuroGames in 2012.\n\nBudapest Pride was the first such event in the former Eastern Bloc, and draws a steady, but a moderate number of LGBT people and their supporters. The LGBT festival lasts a week every summer with a film festival, a pride march and parties across the city. The festival was opened in the past by notable public figures including Gábor Demszky, then Mayor of Budapest, and Kinga Göncz, then Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn correlation with the prime ministership of Viktor Orbán, LGBT rights in Hungary have stalled. In March 2016, the Hungarian Government blocked a proposed European Union agreement to combat discrimination against LGBT people. In May 2017, Prime Minister Orbán welcomed the World Congress of Families, a designated hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, at the National Parliament. In 2018, Hungary and Poland blocked a joint statement by EU employment and social affairs ministers intended to promote gender equity in the digital era because of objections to a reference to LGBT people. However, Austria—then president of the Council of the European Union—adopted the text regardless, though with modifications. While the reference to LGBT people was retained, the text was classified as \"presidential conclusions\" which do not carry the legal weight of formal Council conclusions.\n\nIn recent years, more and more politicians have resorted to use openly homophobic rhetoric. In 2014, Jobbik displayed a sign reading \"The Parliament Does Not Want Any Deviants\" during Budapest Pride, and verbally abused attendees and defaced posters in support of LGBT rights. In November 2016, it protested the painting of a fence with rainbow colours in Pomáz, even though the colouring had no connections to LGBT rights.\n\nThe 2017 Budapest Pride parade attracted thousands of people, and received the support of many embassies, including from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as neighbouring Slovakia and Slovenia, among others.\n\nIn January 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that asylum seekers may not be subjected by authorities to psychological tests in order to determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2012, Jobbik MP Adam Mirkoczki introduced a constitutional amendment to the Parliament seeking to ban \"the promotion of sexual deviations\". The amendment would punish the \"promotion of homosexuality or other disorders of sexual behaviour\" with up to 8 years in prison. LMBT Federation, a Hungarian LGBT advocacy group, protested against the amendment and called on Parliament to reject it. The Democratic Coalition also voiced their opposition and called it \"mean and shameful\". The amendment ultimately failed to pass.\n\nIn November 2016, the small Hungarian town of Ásotthalom passed a law banning \"gay propaganda\", Muslim call to prayer and Muslim clothing. The Mayor called on Christians locals to support a \"holy war on Muslims and multiculturalism\". In April 2017, after a lawsuit challenging the ban was filed, the Constitutional Court struck down the ban, ruling that it violated human rights law as it aimed to \"limit directly the freedom of speech, conscience and religion\".\n\nIn June 2018, the Hungarian State Opera House cancelled 15 Billy Elliot performances, after a government newspaper claimed that the show could turn kids gay, a claim which has absolutely no scientific backing and is perceived as homophobic.\n\nPolls reflecting popular opinion on same-sex marriage in Hungary have shown a mixed picture.\n\nAccording to a Eurobarometer survey published on December 2006, only 18 percent of Hungarians surveyed supported same-sex marriage, and only 13 percent recognized a same-sex couple's right to adopt, compared to the EU-wide average of 44 percent and 33 percent, respectively. However, a poll conducted a year after in 2007 indicated that 30 percent of the Hungarian public supported same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Eurobarometer poll taken in 2015 suggested 39% of Hungarians supported same-sex marriage. A more recent poll by the Pew Research Center, published in May 2017, suggested that 27% of Hungarians were in favor of same-sex marriage, while 64% opposed it. Support was higher among non-religious people (34%) and 18–34 year olds (39%), in contrast to Catholics (25%) and people aged 35 and over (23%).\n\nIn May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society's view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Hungary was ranked 49th with a GHI score of 47.\n\nAccording to a 2017 poll carried out by ILGA, 64% of Hungarians agreed that gay, lesbian and bisexual people should enjoy the same rights as straight people, while 15% disagreed. Additionally, 69% agreed that they should be protected from workplace discrimination. 13% of Hungarians, however, said that people who are in same-sex relationships should be charged as criminals, while 64% disagreed. As for transgender people, 60% agreed that they should have the same rights, 64% believed they should be protected from employment discrimination and a plurality of 48% believed they should be allowed to change their legal gender.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795633", "title": "Canton, Baltimore", "text": "Canton, Baltimore\n\nCanton is a historic waterfront neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The neighborhood is along Baltimore's outer harbor in the southeastern section of the city, roughly two miles east of Baltimore's downtown district and next to or near the neighborhoods of Patterson Park, Fell's Point, Highlandtown, and Brewers Hill.\n\nCanton is considered one of Baltimore's trendiest and vibrant neighborhoods, known for its family-friendly community, urban lifestyle and hot spot for the social scene. The inclusive neighborhood continues to see rapid growth as more development opportunities come into the area. Since the late 1990s, the neighborhood has undergone significant gentrification and has been ranked the 16th most-gentrified zip code in the nation from 2000–2016.\n\nIn 1785, Irish merchant John O'Donnell settled in Baltimore and began trading with merchants in the Chinese port of Guangzhou, then called Canton by English speakers. When O'Donnell purchased land, he named his plantation Canton. In the late 18th century, O'Donnell's land was sold off by his son Columbus O’Donnell, William Patterson and Peter Cooper, and was developed by the Canton Company for the waterfront industry and blue-collar housing.\n\nA major feature of early Canton was Major David Stodder's shipyard, located at Harris Creek, with the most famous vessel being built the USS \"Constellation\".\n\nDuring the early 19th century, European immigrants settled in the area. Welsh immigrants, primarily workers from South Wales, began settling in Baltimore in large numbers beginning in the 1820s. Welsh and Irish migrant workers composed a large portion of Baltimore's working class during the early and mid-1800s. In 1850, a large community of copper workers from Wales settled in the neighborhood. These workers established a Presbyterian church in 1865, located on Toone Street in Canton. Subsequent groups of immigrants have included Germans, Poles and Ukrainians.\n\nIn the 2000s, as industry moved out, new housing and marinas have been developed along the waterfront and gentrification of the existing housing has occurred further inland.\n\nCanton is bounded by Patterson Park and Eastern Ave to the north, Chester Street to the west, the waterfront to the south, and Conkling Street to the east. The streets are laid out in a uniform north to south and east to west directions, with the major exception of Boston Street, which runs along the Patapsco River waterfront.\n\nCanton is conveniently situated with easy access to Interstate 95, Interstate 895 and Boston Street and Eastern Avenues, which provide major surface routes to downtown Baltimore. Two high-frequency MTA bus lines (Gold and Navy) service Canton for direct access to the central business district and Penn Station. The south waterfront area provides a water taxi link to Locust Point.\n\nBus transportation to New York City and Washington, D.C. is available with frequent service at a nearby Eastern Bus stop on Ponca Street.\n\nMany of the structures are included in the Canton Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\nCanton's traditional center is O'Donnell Square, a small park bordered on the north and south by O'Donnell Street, to the east by South Potomac Street, and to the west by Linwood Avenue. O'Donnell Square is home to a number of lively bars and restaurants, gift shops, salons and other small businesses, as well as residences. Canton is also immediately adjacent to Patterson Park, a popular nearby attraction for local residents. In the 2000s, developments have added focus areas to the neighborhood, including the Canton Waterfront Park and Maryland Korean War Memorial, the rehabilitated American Can Company building, the Du Burns Soccer Arena, two marinas, a public boat launch, and new bars and restaurants. The Canton Dog Park, the first off-leash dog park in Baltimore, has been open for dog lovers since 2002.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to the many food and wine festivals, Light Night Canton, Baltimore's annual Ukrainian-American festival, summer concert series, and is a popular destination to view Baltimore Harbor July 4th fireworks. A premier shopping complex, The Shops at Canton Crossing, anchored by Target and Nordstrom Rack, has been serving local residents since 2013.\n\nNotable churches in the area include the St. Casimir (Roman Catholic) Church, built c. 1926, the St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church, and the (Episcopal) Church on the Square.\nCanton’s branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore’s first and in operation since 1866, is centrally located on O’Donnell Square.\n\nA moored trash interceptor, the female-gendered Professor Trash Wheel (with appropriate googly eyes) can be found off the Boston Street Pier Park since December 2016.\n\nMost houses in Canton are turn-of-the-20th-century two- to three-story rowhouses. Some homes closer to the waterfront date from the Civil War and many are well-preserved despite their age. New townhouses have recently been built at O'Donnell Square and throughout the neighborhood, replacing some of the previous stock. There are also luxury waterfront apartments and condominiums in recently rehabilitated industrial buildings. According to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance, the median price of homes sold in 2016 was $286,500, an increase from $231,000 in 2011.\n\nBased on data derived from the census of 2010 and 2014 ACS 5-year estimate, there were 11,398 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Canton was 90.8% White, 3.9% African American, 0.1% Native American, 2.3% Asian, 1.0% from other races, and 2.0% from two or more races. The median household income in 2016 was $103,282, the 2nd highest of all Baltimore neighborhoods, behind Roland Park. 88.1% of the working-age population is employed, 3.0% is unemployed, both rates highest and lowest, respectively, among all Baltimore neighborhoods.\n\n"}

The most common ethnic groups are Vili, Lumbu, and Punu, and locals of Mayumba town call themselves 'Mayesiens'. It is home to an airport, several small restaurants, and a market. There are seven primary schools in the area, and one junior high school of about 500 students. Mayumba lies north of Mayumba National Park, the only national park in Gabon that is dedicated to the protection of marine species.\n\nMayumba town is nestled among three small hills separating the lagoon from the ocean. Sleepy at the best of times, its two main streets only come to life at twilight when the townspeople meander past the market and a scattered small bars, exchanging greetings and the news of the day. It is a time to catch up, sip a cold beer and enjoy the cool of the evening. Instead of the roar of traffic, you are serenaded by the melodies of southern Gabon’s singing celebrity Annie-Flore Batchielillys, or at least a chorus of ardent local fans. \n\nOysters are part of Mayesien life. Each dry season (June to September) salt water floods in from the ocean, turning the lagoon near Mayumba clear and salty. This has two exciting effects. First, the clear sea water cleans the oyster beds near the lagoon mouth, making this wonderful seafood deliciously palatable. Secondly, the greater water visibility permits locals to dive for oysters and take them back for sale at Mayumba’s market. Oysters are purchased alive or already cooked ‘kebab’ style. Visitors can even try their hand at diving for an oyster (the usual depth of the water is only 3 meters (10 feet)) after which the diving party retires to the beach front where the oysters are grilled in their shells on open fires.\n\nMayumba is home to a very relaxed pace of life, but for those with energy to spare after a hard morning of tanning, swimming or sampling the local seafood, there are several good walks to be had in and around the town, with excellent views of the lagoon and the ocean. The seashore itself draws walkers like a magnet, and the wild coast to the immediate south of the town offers hiking limited only by your own stamina. Return home through the savannah for the chance to catch a glimpse of a rare bird or a sitatunga antelope.\n\nMayumba has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification \"Aw\").\n"}

{"id": "1795679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795679", "title": "One Campaign", "text": "One Campaign\n\nOne Campaign (stylised ONE Campaign) is an international, nonpartisan, non-profit, advocacy and campaigning organization that fights extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa, by raising public awareness and pressuring political leaders to support policies and programs that are saving lives and improving futures.\n\nOne Campaign was founded in 2004 by Bobby Shriver and Bono along with a coalition of 11 non-profit humanitarian and advocacy organizations; those organizations included DATA, CARE, World Vision, Oxfam America, and Bread for the World. Funding was provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2007, One announced that it would be merging with DATA.\n\nAs of 2016, One was a worldwide membership organization of more than nine million people.\n\nOne advocates for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and for policies that benefit those who live in conditions of extreme poverty around the globe. One supports a broad variety of international development issues, including the fight against treatable and preventable diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; access to clean water and expanded access to energy; lessening corruption and improving transparency standards and government accountability to citizens; making trade fairer; providing basic education for all; and increasing international affairs budgets.\n\nOne Campaign was founded by Irish musician Bono and American attorney Bobby Shriver, along with 11 organizations: Bread for the World, CARE, DATA, International Medical Corps, International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, Oxfam America, Plan USA, Save the Children U.S., World Concern, and World Vision.\n\nThe name One was inspired by the belief that one voice, coming together with many others — the political left and right, business leaders, activists, faith leaders and students — can change the world for the better. \n\nThe official One launch rally was held on May 16, 2004, at Liberty Mall in Philadelphia, United States. Approximately 2,000 people attended, including Bono, Dikembe Mutombo, Michael W. Smith, Richard Stearns (president of World Vision), and David Beckmann (president of Bread for the World).\n\nIn December 2004, One announced a $3 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mark McKinnon, an adviser to United States President Bush, and Mike McCurry, an adviser to the presidential campaign of John Kerry, appeared on CNN's \"Inside Politics with Judy Woodruff\" in 2004 in support of One.\n\nIn 2008, One merged with DATA. The merged entity was run by CEO David J. Lane until his departure in early 2011 to join the Obama administration. Former editor of \"Time\" magazine, CEO Michael Elliott, led One from 2011 until early 2016, and was One's Senior Strategic Advisor until his passing in July 2016. \n\nDuring the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the organization launched a campaign called One Vote '08. The campaign was co-chaired by former U.S. Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Bill Frist (R-TN). Since 2009, One has run a series of One Vote campaigns around national elections, including One VOTE 2010 in the United Kingdom, One Vote 2012 in both France, and One Vote 2012 and One Vote '16 in the United States.\n\nIn 2010, the Gates Foundation's Living Proof Project became part of One.\n\nOne has a focus on ‘Factivism’ (fact-based activism), as referenced in Bono's 2013 TED talk. \n\nIn 2014, One's \"Trillion Dollar Scandal\" report was released. It suggested that $1 trillion leaves developing countries each year through various forms of corrupt activity. Since the release of the report, more than 50,000 people have signed a petition asking world leaders to sign up to the \"Fair Play Standard\" - a set of measures that would help promote transparency and reduce money flowing outwards as a result of corrupt activity.\n\nIn 2015, One collected signatures for an open letter addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa, respectively, in order to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that would establish new development goals for the generation. The following people signed the open letter: Ali Hewson, Angelique Kidjo, Beyoncé, Charlize Theron, Christy Turlington, Danai Gurira, Helene Gayle, Lady Gaga, Lauren Bush, Mabel van Oranje, Dr. Maria Furtwangler, Meryl Streep, Michele Sullivan (president of the Caterpillar Foundation, director of Corporate Social Innovation), Naisula Lesuuda (senator, Kenya), Rita Wilson, Rosamund Pike, Sarah Silverman, Sheryl Sandberg, and Yvonne Chaka Chaka.\n\nIn March 2015, One launched a report titled \"Poverty is Sexist\", which details the ways in which women and girls are most seriously affected by poverty. The promotion of this report included the release of the song and accompanying video ‘Strong Girl’ which featured leading female musicians from seven African countries including Kenya's Victoria Kimani, South Africa's Judith Sephuma and Mozambique's Gambela, alongside Nigerian actress Omotola Jalade Ekeinde. It was nominated for ‘Best African Collaboration’ in the All Africa Music Awards.\n\nThe \"Poverty is Sexist\" campaign also encouraged women around the world to pose for a '#Strengthie' – a selfie in the pose of Rosie the Riveter, face of the famous \"We Can Do It!\" poster – and post it online in support of girls and women. Teenage activist and One campaign associate Malala Yousafzai posted a #strengthie from the Malala Campaign Twitter to show her support.\n\nOn World AIDS Day, December 1, 2015, One and Product Red hosted a night of music at Carnegie Hall in New York to celebrate the 15 million people on life-saving anti-retroviral drugs compared to 700,000 in 2000, and to encourage the world to keep its focus on eradicating HIV/AIDS and other preventable diseases by 2030 as one of the Sustainable Development Goals. The event, which also marked One's 10 year anniversary, was hosted by The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah and featured performances from Miley Cyrus, Hozier, Jessie J, Bono and The Edge.\n\nDuring 2015, One worked with partners at Action/2015 and Project Everyone to promote the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development around the world so citizens can hold leaders to account in delivering them by 2030.\n\nOn International Women's Day 2016, One relaunched their Poverty is Sexist campaign, featuring an updated report including new figures, such as the fact that in 2016 half a billion women still cannot read and that girls account for 74% of all new HIV infections among adolescents across Africa. It also lists the 20 worst countries to be a girl, based on a number of factors including the number of years a girl attends school, the proportion of women who have a paid job relative to men and the likelihood of a woman dying during childbirth. On International Women's Day 2017, One released a report that stated 130 million girls are currently out of school. It claims the number of girls missing out on receiving an education amounts to a crisis that must be urgently addressed.\n\nThe campaign involved an open letter signed by several high-profile celebrity activists; including Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Elton John, Colin Farrell, Mary J. Blige and Shonda Rhimes. The letter was addressed to world leaders, asking them to put women and girls at the top of the development agenda in order to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 as per the Sustainable Development Goals. It also asks for better data on females across the globe, to make sure the world can track the improvements being delivered to them.\n\nIn March 2017, Gayle Smith was named president and CEO of One Campaign.\n\nOne Campaign uses a number of highly visible methods to reach out to the general public, promote its message, and encourage advocacy actions. One does not ask for public donations, stating: \"We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.\"\n\nOne Campaign works with volunteer campaigners in different markets to raise awareness and lobby governments to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease. One Youth Ambassadors are selected yearly from Ireland, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy to support its grassroots mobilization and advocacy goals across Europe. One Champions work to advance One's goals in Africa through lobby meetings, campaigning, and awareness raising. In the United States and Canada, One field organizers coordinate campaigning efforts, lobby members of Congress and Parliament, and host community awareness events. On college campuses across the U.S., One Campus chapters are run by students who mobilize their peers to participate in One's advocacy campaigns. One Campus chapters aim to teach students about extreme poverty and encourages members to campaign for lifesaving investments and US development policies.\n\nIn the United States, One announced its support for the Electrify Africa Act of 2013 (H.R. 2548; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the President to establish a multiyear strategy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop an appropriate mix of power solutions to provide sufficient electricity access to people living in rural and urban areas in order to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth. One Campaign said that \"this legislation is a bold vision for U.S. engagement in the energy sector in Africa.\"\n\nOn February 8, 2016, the Electrify Africa Act was signed into law by President Obama. One Campaign members helped achieve this result by hosting events, signing and delivering petitions (360,000 names collected and delivered across all US states) and tweeting their support to politicians. Senator Chris Coons thanked One members for their support in helping raise the profile of the bill.\n\nOne Campaign has worked with Publish What You Pay and a coalition of other non-government organisations around the Cardin-Lugar Amendment and the passing of extractives transparency laws in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn 2014, over 22,000 UK-based One members wrote to their MPs in support of investing 0.7 of Gross National Income to international aid. In June, Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore used his Private Member's Bill to enshrine the law, making the UK the first G7 country to meet the UN spending target.\n\nOne Campaign has been criticized for its response to a book by African economist Dambisa Moyo, \"Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa\", which was published in January 2009. Moyo accused One of mischaracterizing her views. She says that she is against only government aid, not \"their kind of aid\". In June 2009 Dambisa Moyo told former U.S. presidential Republican speech writer Peter Robinson during a Hoover Institute sponsored Uncommon Knowledge interview that \"the harshest thing that has happened [in terms of responses to her 2009 book \"Dead Aid\"], Bono's and Bob Geldof's organization, called One, who I had tried to have a number of meetings with before the book came out, about what the theses of the book were, launched a very vitriolic attack against me. To the point that they were calling organizations ahead of my meetings and media appointments and sent a letter to African NGOs claiming, basically, painting me as a genocidal maniac trying to kill African babies. In other words, trying to get Africans to be against me. To me, that was not really fostering dialogue.\"\n\nIn September 2010, it was reported that One used only 1.2% of their funds for charitable causes. In response, One pointed out that this is not its purpose; it does not provide programs on the ground but instead is an advocacy campaign for their funding. The organization was not fundraising or accepting donations, and was receiving most of its funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n"}

{"id": "1795705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795705", "title": "Street food", "text": "Street food\n\nStreet food is ready-to-eat food or drink sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth, food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but many have spread beyond their region of origin. Most street foods are classed as both finger food and fast food, and are cheaper on average than restaurant meals. The types of street food varies between regions and cultures in different countries around the world. According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat street food every day. A majority of low-and-middle-income consumers rely on the quick access and cheap service of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in developing countries.\nToday, people may purchase street food for a number of reasons, such as convenience, to get flavourful food for a reasonable price in a sociable setting, to try ethnic cuisines, or for nostalgia.\n\nRising concerns of street food includes health hazards and sanitation issues, illegal usage of public or private areas, social and ethical problems, and traffic congestion.\n\nSmall fried fish were a street food in ancient Greece; however, Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low regard. Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was discovered during the excavation of Pompeii. Street food was widely consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes did not have ovens or hearths. Here, chickpea soup with bread and grain paste were common meals. In ancient China, street food generally catered to the poor, however, wealthy residents would send servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their homes.\n\nA traveling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in Cairo, people brought picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the streets and sit on while they ate their meals of lamb kebabs, rice, and fritters that they had purchased from street vendors. In Renaissance Turkey, many crossroads had vendors selling \"fragrant bites of hot meat\", including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted. In 1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and standardize street food.\n\nAztec marketplaces had vendors who sold beverages such as \"atolli\" (\"a gruel made from maize dough\"), almost 50 types of tamales (with ingredients that ranged from the meat of turkey, rabbit, gopher, frog and fish to fruits, eggs and maize flowers), as well as insects and stews. Spanish colonization brought European food stocks like wheat, sugarcane and livestock to Peru, however, most commoners continued to primarily eat their traditional diets. Imports were only accepted at the margins of their diet, for example, grilled beef hearts sold by street vendors. Some of Lima's 19th-century street vendors such as \"Erasmo, the 'negro' sango vendor\" and Na Aguedita are still remembered today.\n\nDuring the American Colonial period, \"street vendors sold oysters, roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes.\" Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise. Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707. Many women of African descent made their living selling street foods in America in the 18th and 19th centuries, with products ranging from fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines, and other sweets in New Orleans. Cracker Jack started as one of many street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.\n\nIn the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold gingerbread-nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside. French fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. Street foods in Victorian London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns, and jellied eels. Mumbai, India has more than a half a million of street food vendors.\n\nStreet food culture in China was first developed in the Tang Dynasty and continued to evolve over millennia. Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary tourism. Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers imported from China during the late 19th century.\n\nRamen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100 years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However, it soon became a \"national dish\" and even acquired regional variations.\n\nIn Thailand, street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of Thailand. It did not become popular among native Thai people until the early-1960s when, due to urban population growth and rising incomes, it had \"displaced home-cooking.\" About 76% of urban residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee, Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually from 2020 forward. Multiple studies showed that contamination of food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the contamination at restaurants. Street vendors of Bangkok today feed 40% of population of that city.\n\nIn Indonesia — especially Java, travelling food and drink vendor has a long history, as they were described in temples bas reliefs dated from 9th century, as well as mentioned in 14th century inscription as a line of work. In Indonesia, street food is sold from carts and bicycles.During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several street food were developed and documented, including satay and \"dawet\" (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban agglomerations, especially in Greater Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya. Some cultures consider rude walking on the street while eating.\n\nStreet food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly between regions and cultures. For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being \"fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area\" and \"draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime\", while street food of Thailand is \"fiery\" and \"pungent with shrimp paste ... and fish sauce.\" New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, however, New York street food also includes everything from \"spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles\" Falafel is very popular in the Middle East as fast food. Vendors sell it on the street concers is most popular in countries like Israel, Egypt, and Syria. Falafel is also the national dish of Israel. Falafel is a deep-fried ball or patty that is made from chickpeas or fava beans and spices. It is a favorite among vegetarians. Jamaican Jerk Chicken is a traditional dish served in the Caribbean Islands. The original marinade demands authentic Caribbean ingredients such as scotch bonnet peppers, allspice berries and sometimes, wood from laurel trees.\nStreet food in Thailand offers various selection of ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks sold by hawkers or vendors at food stalls or food carts on the street side. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best places for street food. Popular street offerings includes \"pad thai\" (stir fried rice noodle), \"som tam\" (green papaya salad), sour \"tom yum\" soup, various selection of Thai curries, to sticky rice mango\n\nIndonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese, and Dutch influences. Indonesian street food often tastes rather strong and spicy. A lot of street food in Indonesia are fried, such as local \"gorengan\" (fritters), also \"nasi goreng\" and \"ayam goreng\", while \"bakso\" meatball soup, skewered chicken satay and \"gado-gado\" vegetable salad served in peanut sauce are also popular.\n\nIndian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its own specialties to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes are Vada pav, Misal pav, Chole bhature, Parathas, Bhel Puri, Sev Puri, Gol Gappa, Aloo tikki, Kebabs, Tandoori chicken, Samosa, Kachori, rolls, Idli, pohe, Bread omelette, Egg bhurji, Pav bhaji, pulaw, kachchhi dabeli, Pakora, bhutta, barf gola, cold coffee, lassi, badam shake, Kulfi, and Falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly known as \"nukkadwala\" food (\"corner\" food). In South India, foods like Mirchi Bajji, Punugulu, Chitti Garelu/Mini Vada,Chicken Pakodi, Mokkajonna (Corn roasted on coal) are famous street foods along with breakfast items like Idli, Vada, Dosa, Poori, Bonda etc. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken their inspiration from the vibrant street food of India.\nIn Hawaii, the local street food tradition of \"plate lunch\" (rice, macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the \"bento\" of the Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers. In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passersby to purchase sausages and hot dogs.\n\nIn Egypt, a food sold commonly on the street is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish.\n\nMexican street food is known as \"antojitos\" (translated as \"little cravings\") which include several varieties of tacos, such as tacos al pastor, huaraches and other maize based foods\n\nThere is a stigma in Japan that is against eating on the move. However, during special occasions such as festivals, the streets of Tokyo are filled with vendors that serve food such as odango, sashimi, oyster, and octopus.\n\nBecause of differences in culture, social stratification and history, the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally created and run vary in different areas of the world. Often, women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street food trade. Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes towards meals is one \"cultural factor operating in the street food phenomenon\" in the Philippines because eating \"food out in the open, in the market or street or field\" is \"not at odds with the meal indoors or at home\" where \"there is no special room for dining\".\n\nOther cultural phenomenon that affect the street food market depend on the cultural implications of walking down the street. In some cultures, this is considered to be rude, such as Japanese or Swahili cultures. Despite not being allowed for adults, it is culturally acceptable for children to do. In India, Henrike Donner wrote about a \"marked distinction between food that could be eaten outside, especially by women,\" and the food prepared and eaten at home, with some non-Indian food being too \"strange\" or tied too closely to non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.\n\nIn Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the area have expanded. In the United States, street food vendors are credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying meals for the city's merchants and workers. Proprietors of street food in the United States have had a goal of upward mobility, moving from selling on the street to their own shops. However, in Mexico, an increase in street vendors has been seen as a sign of deteriorating economic conditions in which food vending is the only employment opportunity that unskilled labor who have migrated from rural areas to urban areas are able to find.\n\nIn 2002, Coca-Cola reported that China, India, and Nigeria were some of its fastest-growing markets: markets where the company's expansion efforts included training and equipping mobile street vendors to sell its products.\n\nThe libertarian \"Reason\" magazine states that in US, cities, food trucks are subject to regulations designed to prevent them from competing with bricks and mortar restaurants. For example, in Chicago, a regulation prevents food trucks \"...from selling food within 200 feet of brick-and-mortar restaurants and, hence, prohibit them from operating throughout the city's downtown area\", which critics have called an \"anti-competitive\" rule for food truck operators.\n\nSince 1984, Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco is home of one of the most diverse street food fair. In addition to lots of leather, and people in various states of dress and undress, the event features an outdoor food court serving a variety of street food. For $10 or more donations visitors get $2 discount for each drink purchased at the fair.\n\nIn 2018, the street photographer Michael Rababy documented on his book, \"Folsom Street Food Court\"\",\" the world infamous street food festival Folsom Street Fair.\n\nAs early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food vendor activities. With the increasing pace of globalization and tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise public awareness. However, despite concerns about contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low, with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.\n\nIn 2002, a sampling of 511 street foods in Ghana by the World Health Organization showed that most had microbial counts within the accepted limits, and a different sampling of 15 street foods in Calcutta showed that they were \"nutritionally well balanced\", providing roughly 200 kcal (Cal) of energy per rupee of cost.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and retailers of the street food sector since 2000. Other effective ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing and membership management programs, and technical testing programs.\n\nDespite knowledge of the risk factors, actual harm to consumers’ health is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness. The fact that social and geographical origins largely determine consumers’ physiological adaptation and reaction to foods—whether contaminated or not—is neglected in the literature.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the United Nations and other organizations began to recognize that street vendors had been an underused method of delivering fortified foods to populations, and in 2007, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization recommended considering methods of adding nutrients and supplements to street foods that are commonly consumed by the particular culture.\n\nNew policies and regulations are made all the time to make sure each vendor is selling safe and healthy food to the rest of society. Street food is worldwide and the amount of different kinds of food trucks is never ending. Most street food vendors do not provide many healthy options on their menu, about 70% of vendors said they on have one item that is considered to be healthy on the entire menu. Living in the city you see a food truck or multiple parked on every street, there are many varieties of trucks such as burgers, falafel, sandwiches, pizza, smoothies, and many more.\n\n"}

It honours celebrities of the Hong Kong film industry.\n\nIn 1982, the New World Group built a promenade along the waterfront around the New World Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon. In 2004, the Group announced it would spend HK$40 million to build the Avenue of Stars, a project supported by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Tourism Commission, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Film Awards Association.\n\nThe avenue was opened to the general public on 28 April 2004 with an opening ceremony held the previous day, 27 April 2004. The opening ceremony was presided over by a number of government and industry figures, including Henry Tang (\"Financial Secretary\"), Stephen Ip (\"Secretary for Economic Development and Labour\"), Patrick Ho (\"Secretary of Home Affairs\"), Selina Chow (\"Chair of Hong Kong Tourism Board\"), Manfred Wong (Director/Actor), and Cheng Yu Tung (Chair of New World Group); in which the privately funded avenue was handed over to the Hong Kong SAR government as public property. At opening, the avenue honoured an initial 73 inductees elected by the Hong Kong Film Awards Association and the readers of \"City Entertainment\".\n\nAfter having managed the avenue for 11 years, its contract is due to expire. It was announced in August 2015 that the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong government would redevelop and expand the avenue jointly with the company. The Hong Kong government declared that the enhancement project would contain limited commercial appeal, and no luxury shops or high-end restaurants would be added. The walkway, very popular with tourists, is to be closed off and relocated to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Waterfront Podium Garden temporarily for three years while the expansion is undertaken.\n\nThe decision to award the contract for the redevelopment to the company without putting it out to tender, on the justification that the project was non-profit, sparked controversy locally. Residents' groups and other development companies owning properties adjacent to the walk expressed discontent, whilst the LCSD claimed that consultations with the local district council had been favourable. In an apparent attempt to de-fuse the public furore at the apparent collusion between government and big business, the government promised a public consultation.\n\nOn 31 January 2019, the Avenue was reopened to the public after 3 years of renovation, redesigned by New York High Line architect James Corner Field Operations (JCFO) together with other international and local designers.\n\nThe Avenue of Stars is the eastern node of several tourist attractions along the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront. In addition to the promenade and New World Centre, a number of attractions exist including the Museum of Art, Space Museum, Cultural Centre and the Clock Tower.\n\nEntering from Salisbury Garden, a 4.5-metre-tall replica of the statuette given to winners at the Hong Kong Film Awards greets visitors. Along the 440-metre promenade, the story of Hong Kong's one hundred years of cinematic history is told through inscriptions printed on nine red pillars. Set into the promenade are plaques honouring the celebrities. Some plaques contain hand prints and autographs of the stars set in cement, but most of the plaques only contain celebrities' names as they are now deceased. A 2.5-metre bronze statue of Bruce Lee was erected along the Avenue of Stars in 2005.\n\nThe promenade commands a stunning panoramic view across Victoria Harbour. At night it is a popular viewing place for the Symphony of Lights display.\n\nA large replica of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch will be on permanent display here.\n\nThe following people have received plaques on the avenue of stars.\n<br>\n\n\n"}

Its founder was Cha Mirisa (차미리사, 1880-1955), an educator and leader of the Joseon Women's Education Society. At the time it was known as the Geunhwa Academy. Because the name Geunhwa (근화, 槿花) refers to the Korean national flower, it was changed to \"Duksung\" under pressure from Japanese authorities in 1938.\n\nDuksung was officially founded as a college, on the site of the Unhyeongung palace, in 1950. During this same year, on May, 17 Duksung Woman's Junior College was established. As well as, the opening of a department of Korean literature and a department of domestic science.

In October 1921, she established \"Geunhwa Women's School\" with the contributions collected from some lectures, assuming the office as a schoolmistress. She held lectures, musical concerts, plays, and bazaars to raise funds to maintain the school with no support from the Joseon Government-general or foreign missionaries.\n\nIn February 1934, she established a foundation named Geunhwa School, inaugurated as a chief director. She expanded and developed further \"Geunhwa Woman's School\" into \"Geunhwa Woman's Vocational School.\" After this, due to the insistence of the Japanese imperialists that Geunhwa represents Korea's national flower of an althea, the name of the school was changed to \"Duksung School.\"\n\nAs the nation restored its independency in 1945, she established a higher educational institution for woman - Duksung Woman's Junior College (presently Duksung Woman's University).

It was transformed in 2011 with a $1.2 million landscape renovation designed by South Florida landscape architect Raymond Jungles. The new landscape showcases native Florida plants and trees including bromeliads, palms, cycad, orchids and many others. There is a Japanese garden, native garden and bio-swale, and water gardens including ponds, fountains, and a wetland with mangrove and pond apple trees. The renovation also expanded the Great Lawn area for corporate and social events, established a plant nursery and event plaza, and enhanced the night-time lights, entrance gate, and pathways.\n\nThe Garden offers free admission and is open Tuesday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nIn 1962, the City of Miami Beach created the \"Garden Center\" on a vacant site opposite the Miami Beach Convention Center built in 1957. Operated then as a City park, the Garden was situated on the historic Collins Canal, an integral part of the beginnings of Miami Beach. In the early 1900s pioneer John S. Collins dug the canal to transport mangoes and avocados, then called alligator pears by boat to the Port of Miami from groves along what is now Pinetree Drive.\nIn the 1920s pioneer Carl Fisher developed Lincoln Road, luxury hotels such as the Flamingo and the Nautilus with polo fields and golf courses. The Garden site was originally a golf course.\nBy 1922 Miami Beach boasted the largest avocado and mango groves in the world, but Miami's agricultural roots wouldn't last much longer, sacrificed for the tourist trade. Tourism has long been a driving force in Miami Beach, but the City also experienced the impact of economic recessions, World Wars, and destructive hurricanes. The Garden had sadly deteriorated before the Art Deco renaissance of the 1980s and after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. A group of residents approached the City in 1996 to create the Miami Beach Garden Conservancy as a non-profit organization with a mission to restore the Garden. Today's Miami Beach Botanical Garden is a public/private partnership, owned by the City of Miami Beach. The Garden has again become a dynamic venue for arts and cultural programming, environmental education and cultural tourism.\n\nThe mission of the Miami Beach Botanical Garden is to promote environmental enjoyment, stewardship and sustainability through education, the arts, and interaction with the natural world. Our garden is a unique, subtropical oasis of beauty and tranquility within an urban setting—a community resource that refreshes, inspires and engages our visitors.\n\nThe Miami Beach Garden Club is a non-profit organization affiliated with the Florida Federations of Garden Clubs. The organization promotes the cultivation of plants and flowers within the community through projects that focus on: beautification of Miami Beach; mentoring and sponsoring student programs both locally and statewide; and support of the Miami Beach Botanical Garden. The Miami Beach Garden club also works with local Girl Scouts and school children at multiple local schools by continuing to expand their knowledge through monthly programs.\n\nOne of the main features of the Miami Beach Botanical Garden is its Japanese Garden. This tranquil corner of the garden is defined by a red lacquered bridge spanning a quiet pond dotted with water lilies. Stone lanterns stand among the plantings based on the principles of Feng shui, where specific orientation and placing of certain elements helps to capture the energy and spirit of nature. Significant plantings here include the red powder puff shrub (Calliandra haematocephala), golden trumpet tree (Tabebuia caribea), and various types of tropical bamboo.\n\nWater is a focal point in all areas of the garden. According to the garden's landscape architect Raymond Jungles, the element of water is significant because it \"brings the sky into the garden, animates the space, reflects the landscape, and cools the areas directly around the buildings. Water magnifies the garden's sense of scale.\"\nOutside the offices is a refurbished fountain designed by Morris Lapidus. Beyond the fountain is the main pond with a cascading oolite fountain and flowering water lilies. The adjoining wetland contains red mangroves, pond apple trees (Annona glabra), and rush grasses. During the day you can see dragonflies, koi, and if you're lucky, one very shy turtle roaming the waters.\n\nThe edible garden remains a reliable source of sustenance and natural beauty. It was made possible in part by the local chapter of Les Dames d'Escoffier: an international organization of women in the field of food, drink and gastronomy. This tropical edible garden contains pineapples (Ananas comosus), pomegranates (Punica granatum), coffee (Coffea arabica), and even raspberries. Often, the staff harvests fresh food and herbs from the garden to supplement workshops, mixers and other events.\n\n\n"}

In 1929 he took his undergraduate degree at Nankai University in Tianjin (Tientsin). He moved to the United States for graduate schooling and obtained a Doctor of Philosophy Degree from the University of Michigan in 1933.\n\nWu returned to China (then Republic of China) after receiving his doctorate degree, and between 1934 and 1949 he taught at various institutions there, including Peking University in Beijing, and National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming. In 1949, the year of the defeat of the Nationalists by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Wu moved to Canada.\n\nThere he headed the Theoretical Physics Division of the National Research Council until 1963. In the 1960s, he was Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University at Buffalo.

This is closely related to the fluctuation and interplay of the two polar energies, yin and yang and its cycle appeared in daily, yearly, and cosmically. 129,600 calendar years make up one Cosmic year and it was discovered by Shao Yung.\n\nThe creative cycle can be seen in the passing of one day. At night, yin is at its strongest. The moon, darkness, stillness, and quietness all have yin nature. Night is a time of rest. When the sun, which has yang nature, rises, it is a time of birth. People tend to follow this flow of energy by sleeping at night and waking up in the morning. As the sun rises, yang becomes stronger and people tend to become more active. The afternoon is a time of growth. Eventually, yang reaches its highest peak, and from that point on, yin starts to regain its influence, and human activity starts to wind down. For many people, the evening is a time of relaxation and entertainment. This is the harvest in which they enjoy what they have worked for. Finally, yin becomes very dominant and things tend to return to the night time state of rest.\n\nThis process can also be seen in the cycle of one year. Heat is a manifestation of yang, and when the temperature rises in spring, sprouts break through the surface of the ground, dead yellow grass is replaced with new green grass, and new leaves appear on the trees. Spring is a time of birth. As summer approaches, yang continues to rise as yin diminishes. Things grow more rapidly and vegetation becomes lush. Summer is a time of growth. By the time autumn comes, yin has started to regain its influence. Autumn is a time of harvest when things come to fruition, and during autumn, as yin becomes more and more dominant, things return to the winter state of rest. Year after year this cycle repeats.\n\nAccording to Jeung San Do's teachings, the universe follows the cycle of birth-growth-harvest-rest (生長殮藏) or spring-summer-autumn-winter. This cycle, called the Cosmic Year, repeats every 129,600 calendar years, a number calculated by Chinese scholar Shao Yung. At the beginning and end of each cycle, the universe is in a yin state of dormancy called the cosmic winter. On our planet, this manifests as an ice age. As the yang energy regains its influence, the cosmic winter changes to spring and new life and a new human species appear on the earth. We call the current stage of humanity homo sapiens sapiens. The time of cosmic spring and summer is one of growth and diversity during which many cultures and civilizations develop. It is also a time of conflict. Cosmic autumn is a time of returning to oneness, a time in which humanity harvests its diverse experiences and accomplishments to create a global civilization of harmony.\n\nAt any stage of the cosmic year, the position of the Earth's axis demonstrates the concurrent relationship between yin and yang. It is generally accepted that in the history of our planet there have been periodic changes in the Earth's poles, magnetism, and orbit.\n\nWhat is left to debate is whether these changes occur gradually or suddenly. If we examine changes in nature during a calendric year, it becomes obvious that change occurs both suddenly and gradually. An example of this is the cherry blossom, which blooms in March. Gradually, over the course of a few months buds grow on the cherry tree, but suddenly, within a day or so, all of the flowers bloom at once. Finally, with just one strong wind or a heavy rain all of the blossoms fall.\n\nIn anthroposophy, based on teachings by Rudolf Steiner, a cosmic year represents the Platonic year, a period of 25,920 years. This is the time required for the Sun's position at spring equinox to traverse the complete zodiac. So each zodiacal sign covers about 2160 years. The year 747 BCE marked the transition from Taurus to Aries and since 1453, the spring equinoctial sun is in Pisces. This cosmic cycle has a considerable influence on humanity in both physical and spiritual respects. For instance, the Aries period covered the Greek/Roman culture period ranging from the foundation of Rome (753 BCE) to the fall of Byzantium (1453), whereas the Taurus period marked the Egyptian/Chaldaean era. Another example is human breathing rhythm: an average of 18 cycles per minute represents 18 x 60 x 24 = 25,920 cycles per day. The number of daily sleep-wake-cycles of the conscious mind in an average human lifetime of 72 years adds up to the same platonic figure. Shao Yung's cosmic year represents exactly five platonic years (5x25,920=129,600).\n\nVedic scriptures delineate a cosmic cycle of creation and destruction marked by 4 Yugas. There is considerable debate on the duration of one Yuga, varying from 1200 to 432,000 or millions years. Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri estimates the duration of two total cycles (an descending and an ascending part) to comprise 24000 years. According to Vamadeva David Frawley the Yuga cycle relates to the precession of the equinoxes, thus suggesting a relationship with the platonic year. In the interpretations of these and other vedic scholars, modern times (1700–1900) have witnessed the end of the dark \"Iron Age\" (Kali Yuga), a notion supported by Rudolf Steiner.\n\n"}

In the latter he categorized the Los Angeles experience into four ecological models (Surfurbia, Foothills, The Plains of Id, and Autopia) and explored the distinct architectural cultures of each. Banham worked in London, but lived primarily in the United States from the late 1960s until the end of his life.\n\nHe was born in Norwich, England to Percy Banham, a gas engineer, and Violet Frances Maud Reyner. He was educated at Norwich School and gained an engineering scholarship with the Bristol Aeroplane Company, where he spent much of the Second World War. In Norwich he gave art lectures, wrote reviews for the local paper and was involved with the Maddermarket Theatre. In 1949 Banham entered the Courtauld Institute of Art in London where he studied under Anthony Blunt, Sigfried Giedion and Nikolaus Pevsner. Pevsner, who was his doctoral supervisor, invited Banham to study the history of modern architecture, following his own work \"Pioneers of the Modern Movement\" (1936).\n\nIn 1952 Banham began working for the \"Architectural Review\", having previously written regular exhibition reviews for ArtReview, then titled Art News and Review. Banham also had connections with the Independent Group, the 1956 \"This Is Tomorrow\" art exhibition – considered by many to the birth of pop art – and the thinking of the Smithsons and of James Stirling, on the 'New Brutalism', which he documented in his 1966 book \"The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?\" But before this in \"Theory and Design in the First Machine Age\", he cut across mentor Pevsner's main theories, linking modernism to build structures in which the 'functionalism' was actually subject to formal structures. Later, he wrote a \"Guide to Modern Architecture\" (1962, later titled \"Age of the Masters, a Personal View of Modern Architecture\"). Banham predicted a \"second age\" of the machine and mass consumption. \"The Architecture of Well-Tempered Environment\" (1969) follows Giedion's \"Mechanization Takes Command\" (1948), putting the development of technologies such as electricity and air conditioning ahead of the classic account of structures. In the 1960s, Cedric Price, Peter Cook, and the Archigram group also found this to be an absorbing arena of thought.\n\nGreen thinking (\"Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies\") and then the oil shock of 1973 affected him. The 'postmodern' was for him uneasy, and he evolved into the conscience of postwar British architecture. He broke with utopian and technical formalism. \"Scenes in America Deserta\" (1982) talks of open spaces and his anticipation of a 'modern' future. In \"A Concrete Atlantis: U.S. Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture, 1900–1925\" (1986) Banham demonstrates the influence of American grain elevators and \"Daylight\" factories on the Bauhaus and other modernist projects in Europe.\n\nAs a professor, Banham taught at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London and the State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo from 1976 to 1980, and through the 1980s at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He had been appointed the Sheldon H. Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University shortly before his death, but he never taught there.\n\nHe was featured in the short documentary \"Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles\"; in his book on Los Angeles, Banham said that he learned to drive so he could read the city in the original.\n\nIn 1988 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists.\n\nIn 2003, Nigel Whiteley published a critical biography of Banham, \"Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future\", in which he gives an in-depth overview of Banham's work and ideas.\n\n\n"}

This in effect abolished the monarchy and the House of Lords.\n\nThe Council of State was appointed by Parliament on 14 and 15 February 1649, with further annual elections. The Council's duties were to act as the executive of the country's government in place of the King and the Privy Council. It was to direct domestic and foreign policy and to ensure the security of the English Commonwealth. Due to the disagreements between the New Model Army and the weakened Parliament, it was dominated by the Army.\n\nThe Council held its first meeting on 17 February 1649 \"with [Oliver] Cromwell in the chair\". This meeting was quite rudimentary, \"some 14 members\" attending, barely more than the legal quorum of nine out of forty-one councillors elected by Parliament. The first elected president of the council, appointed on 12 March, was John Bradshaw who had been the President of the Court at the trial of Charles I and the first to sign the King's death warrant.\n\nThe members of the first council were the Earls of Denbigh, Mulgrave, Pembroke, and Salisbury; Lords Grey and Fairfax; Lisle, Rolle, Oliver St John, Wilde, Bradshaw, Cromwell, Skippon, Pickering, Masham, Haselrig, Harington, Vane jun, Danvers, Armine, Mildmay, Constable, Pennington, Wilson, Whitelocke, Martin, Ludlow, Stapleton, Heveningham, Wallop, Hutchinson, Bond, Popham, Valentine Walton, Scot, Purefoy, Jones.\n\nWhen the Rump Parliament was dissolved by Cromwell with the support of the Army Council on 20 April 1653, the Council went into abeyance. It was reconstituted on 29 April with thirteen members seven of whom were Army officers. With the failure of Barebone's Parliament, the Council was re-modelled with the Instrument of Government to become something much closer to the old Privy Council advising the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. Constitutionally between thirteen and twenty-one councillors were elected by Parliament to advise the Protector, who was also elected by Parliament. In reality Cromwell relied on the Army for support and chose his own councillors.\n\nThe replacement constitution of 1657, the pseudo-monarchical Humble Petition and Advice, authorised 'His Highness the Lord Protector'; to choose twenty-one Councillors and the power to nominate his successor. Cromwell recommended his eldest surviving son Richard Cromwell, who was proclaimed the successor on his father's death on 3 September 1658 and legally confirmed in the position by the newly elected Third Protectorate Parliament on 27 January 1659.\n\nAfter the reinstatement of the Rump Parliament (7 May 1659) and the subsequent abolition of the position of Lord Protector, the role of the Council of State along with other interregnum institutions becomes confused as the instruments of state started to implode. The Council of State was not dissolved until 28 May 1660, when King Charles II personally assumed the government in London.\n\nThe role of the President of the Council of State (usually addressed as \"Lord President\") was intended to simply preside over the Council of State.\n\nJohn Bradshaw, the first president, served in the office longer than any other person to do so (serving for two years and ten months total). The reason no other individual served in the position longer than Bradshaw was due to a resolution passed by the Parliament on 26 November 1651 stating that \"That no Person of any Committee of Parliament, or of the Council of State, shall be in the Chair of that Committee, or Council, for any longer Time, at once, than one Month\" (Commons Journal, 7:43–44). Even during the Protectorate of Oliver and Richard Cromwell, the position of Lord President of the Council of State, known during this period as the Protector's Privy Council, remained in existence until the re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660.\n\nThe following is a list of those who served as the Lord President of the Council of State.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795751", "title": "Gaebyeok", "text": "Gaebyeok\n\nIn the Korean religion of Jeungism, the term Gaebyeok refers to a sudden change in nature, society and human beings.\n\nJeungism calls a sudden change in culture, human and nature, Gaebyeok. Both syllables, gae (開) and byuk (闢), mean \"to open.\" The word comes from the Sino-Korean phrase \"cheon-ji-gae-byeok\" (天地開闢), which means \"heaven opens and earth opens.\"\n\nThroughout a Cosmic Year there are major gaebyeoks and minor gaebyeoks. Every Cosmic Month (10,800 years) there is a minor gaebyeok accompanied by a minor but sudden shift of the Earth's axis. Every Cosmic Season (20,000-50,000 years) there is a major gaebyeok with a more dramatic shift in the Earth's axis.\n\nGaebyeok can also mean a dramatic change within a person, such as a transformation in one's physical condition or a sudden spiritual awakening. Or gaebyeok can refer to a transformation in society.\n\nAccording to Jeungism, humanity is now living near the end of the Cosmic Summer. The Cosmic Summer and Spring have been a time of growth, diversity, and conflict, but autumn will be a time of maturity, returning to oneness, and harmony.\n\nFor this to happen, the Autumn Gaebyeok must take place on three levels: \n\nThe gaebyeok of nature will happen as automatically as the changing of seasons within a year, but the transformation of individuals and society is in the hands of humankind. Soon, the Earth's axis will shift perfectly upright, demonstrating the perfect balance between yin and yang in autumn, and the Earth's orbit around the sun will change to 360 degrees. These conditions will create a milder climate for the entire world. The time of equal yin and yang is a time of maturity and harmony. The Autumn Gaebyeok provides an opportunity for humanity to change along with nature and reach a harmonious and spiritually awakened existence. Obviously, a shifting of the Earth's axis will be a worldwide natural disaster, unprecedented in our written history.\n\nBut, according to Jeung San Do, the world will be faced with an even greater challenge: global epidemic disease. With the supposed eradication of smallpox in the 1960s, we naively thought that humanity had conquered infectious disease, but in the last thirty years, one or two new infectious diseases have appeared each year, and old diseases have mutated, making them more and more difficult to treat. The potential for a catastrophic global disease already exists.\n\nThe origin of the global disease is the accumulated suffering of humans. Because of the dominance of yang over yin in the cosmic spring and summer, conflict has been the mode of development. Humans have struggled to overcome nature and each other. Men have oppressed women, some races have oppressed others, and heaven has dominated earth. So many people have suffered and harbored inside them deep bitterness and grief. The energy of this bitterness and grief has accumulated and compounded over time and has turned into lethal energy. At the time of the Autumn Gaebyeok, this energy will be released as a global epidemic. Overcoming this outbreak of disease will be the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced and will be a catalyst for global unity. Jeungism calls this \"Euitong\" (醫統), which means \"to heal and unite.\"\n\nJeungic teachings are a combination of harsh realities and gentle love and concern. We are living at the end of the Cosmic Summer, a time marked by war, disease, and inequality, and we will soon be faced with tragedies on a global scale. But, the conflict and suffering of the Cosmic Summer is not without meaning and purpose. Spring exists for summer; summer exists for autumn. Overcoming conflict and suffering within one's life is a process of maturing for the individual. Overcoming the conflict and suffering of the Cosmic Spring and Summer is a process of maturing for humankind.\n\nThe Cosmic Autumn is a time of peace, harmony, and enlightenment, the ultimate freedom from ignorance. We can already see the seeds of the autumn civilization, such as concern for the environment, the movement for equality between men and women, advances leading to greater longevity and quality of life and the movement for basic human rights for all people. In autumn the efforts of humanity come to fruition.\n"}

It lies on a peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gabon Estuary, across which boats sail to Libreville. It also lies near the Pongara National Park.\n\nPoint Denis is a major breeding ground for the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Between 1 800 and 2 000 nests are laid annually on its beaches. Recent studies by Dr Sharon Deem, formerly of the Wildlife Conservation Society, note that the worldwide turtle population is being threatened by man's activities. One such activity is the development of Point Denis. Turtles find their way to the sea by using the light from the moon shimmering off the water as a reference. Man-made artificial lights at night disorientate the female turtles during laying season as well as the hatchlings trying to find their way to the water. As a result, many turtles head off in the wrong direction and can die from starvation and dehydration. Nests are also destroyed by visitors who drive vehicles, mainly quad bikes, on the beaches. Another problem is the pollution from the nearby town of Libreville. Turtles often mistake plastic bags in the water for jellyfish, their principal food source, and die if they ingest them. Nevertheless, there is a growing environmental movement in Gabon, protection of the turtles being one of their priorities.\n\nWildebeest are found in the area, as well as a diverse population of monkeys, birds, snakes and other reptiles.

The club was struggling with a debt of £2,670 at the time.\n\nDavies was born in Tutbury, Staffordshire, the fifth of nine children of David Davies, a Welsh engineer from Mold, Flintshire, and Susannah Nield Davies, from Bunbury, Cheshire. He grew up in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester.\n\nHe did not come from a wealthy family and initially worked as an estate agent and innkeeper. He first moved into the brewing business in the late 1890s as a director of John Henry Lees brewery in Moss Side (formed in 1897). By the beginning of the next century, he was chairman of the Walker and Homfray Brewery, and in 1904 he also became chairman of the Manchester Brewery Company, which owned many public houses in Manchester and Salford. Walker and Homfray took control of the Manchester Brewery and several other companies in 1912. Davies also gained control of Stockport-based Daniel Clifton & Company, which owned around 50 pubs and off-licences. In 1920, he founded the Moss Side Brewery Company and the Palatine Bottling Company.\n\nBefore his involvement in football, he had become independently rich and had also married into another wealthy family. His wife Amy (née Caterall) was the niece and ward of sugar merchant Sir Henry Tate. Davies and his wife became known as philanthropists and were noted for their support of other sports in the Manchester area.\n\nThere is a popular story attached to how he came to take over Newton Heath. According to the story, the club captain Harry Stafford's dog (a St Bernard named Major) wandered away from the player at the club fund-raising bazaar at St James's Hall, Manchester in February 1901. Major was found by Davies, who returned him to Stafford. Davies asked if he could buy the dog, but instead ended up donating to the club. As a gesture of thanks, Stafford allowed him to keep the dog. In March 1902, at a meeting in the New Islington Hall, Stafford announced to Newton Heath supporters that he, Davies and three other local businessmen had agreed to invest £200 each in the club in order to save it after a winding-up order had been issued two months earlier.\n\nUnder Davies's stewardship, the club changed its name to Manchester United FC and switched colours from white and navy to the now-famous red, white and black. Their Bank Street ground was upgraded to accommodate more supporters, and Ernest Mangnall was appointed secretary a year later. Players such as Alex Bell, Harry Moger, Charlie Roberts, George Wall and Charlie Sagar were brought into the club, and by 1906 United had been promoted to the First Division. They won the league in 1908 and the FA Cup in 1909 before Davies funded the move to a new ground at Old Trafford in 1910. A further league championship was won in 1911, but the ageing players, the loss of Mangnall to cross-town rivals Manchester City and the outbreak of the First World War brought an end to the club's first period of success on the pitch. \n\nDavies died Llandudno, Caernarfonshire, Wales, at the age of 63 after being in ill health for the previous three years.\n\n\n"}

Wun(原) means \"origin\" or \"primitive\" and Shi(始) means \"beginning\" or \"start\". Ban(反) means \"reverse\" or \"opposite\" and Bon(本) means \"origin\" or \"base\". Its literal meaning is that returning to the origin.\n\nBefore understanding Unsibanbon further, it is recommended that you understand both Cosmic year and Gaebyeok because Unsibanbon can be explained in more detail in the context of Cosmic year.\n\nThe one constant in the universe is change, and at the time of the Autumn Gaebyeok, the direction of that change is returning to the origin. In our lives we often have the desire to return to our origins whether it means returning home after a long journey, discovering our ethnic and cultural roots, seeking the original purpose of our lives, or returning to the origin of life through meditation. The practice of returning to the origin is discovering who we truly are. It can also entail solving a problem at its root. \n\nAccording to the eastern philosophy, everything is changing and it has its own cycle. It is not difficult to find a cycle. Even our planet earth has its own cycle. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. This cycle is divided with four different seasons, but the principle below is always yin and yang. \n\nWhen yang (positive energy) reaches its end, it must return to its origin. Just like a cannonball shot to the sky directly, it goes up to the sky and at a certain point, it returns to the ground. This action of return at the turning point is called Geukjeukban (克卽反). \n\nAs it is explained above, earth's four seasons can be contained in yin and yang. Spring and summer represent yang (positive energy) and autumn and winter represents yin (negative energy). \n\nWhen summer reaches its end (end of positive energy), just like a cannonball reaches its turning point, it returns to its origin from its farther-reached-end.\n\nThis principle is important because Unsibanbon is happening regardless we acknowledge it or not. Also, it is important to accept and do our action with Unsibanbon this time of our life because it is natural like a shot cannonball returning to the ground from the sky. For this reason, many people meditate to be back to their origin.\n\nQuote from Dojeon\n\n"}

It is also one of the most important manganese mining towns in the world, under the auspices of the \"Compagnie Minière de l'Ogooué\" (COMILOG), which began mining in 1957. Moanda has a population of around 39,298 inhabitants (2010 est.) and is the second largest city in the Haut Ogooué Region, after Franceville. It is also a border town, lying 100 km away from the border with the Republic of Congo.\n\nMoanda was originally a village lying on the swampy banks of the Miosso River. The discovery and exploitation of manganese in the nearby Bangombe Plateau from 1953 led to the emergence of the city. In 1977 Moanda had an estimated 230 million tons of manganese, some one-fifth of the world's deposits. In 1959, the 75 km COMILOG Cableway to the railway at Mbinda in the Republic of Congo was constructed to export the manganese, but it was eventually closed in 1986 when the Trans-Gabon Railway was completed. The city further grew during the 1990s owing to an influx of refugees from then war-torn Republic of Congo.\n\nMoanda lies on several adjacent plateaus lying between the higher and larger Bangombe plateau in the north, and the Miosso swamp in the south. Rocky formations Mount Boundinga and Mount Moanda lie further south.\n\nThe climate is equatorial, with an alternation of thunderstorms and hot temperatures between January and March, and cool temperatures from July to September.\n\nMoanda is divided into three areas. The first area is built on the main plateau and its slopes and includes the commercial centre and populous districts Ankoula, Montagne Sainte and Fumier. The second area includes the most populous districts Alliance, Rio and L'Oasis. The third area is on the easternmost plateau and includes Lekolo and Leyima. Another plateau is home to Rigobert Landji High School, the largest high school in the city. Other districts include the Third Zone in the southwest, and the Mukaba District, on the slopes of the Bangombe Plateau.\n\nOn 24 April 1953 a joint corporation was established to mine a deposit estimated at 50 million tons of manganese ore in Gabon owned by the Bureau of Mines of Overseas France (21%), Eastern Tjbangi Mining Company (15%), Société Mokta El Hadid (15%) and the U.S. Steel (49%).\nA railway had first to be built to the coast, so full production was not expected until at least 1960.\nThe Compagnie minière de l'Ogooué (Comilog) had initial capital of CFA 150 million.\nThe first ore was shipped from Moanda on 2 October 1962.\nMoanda is now one of the largest manganese mining centres in the world.\nThe operating company, COMILOG, exports an average 3.5 million tons of manganese a year.\nThis makes Gabon one of the three largest manganese exporters in the world. The manganese so far is exploited on the Bangombe Plateau (42 km²).\n\nFrench international schools include:\n\nThe main stadium is Stade Henri Sylvoz, the home of AS Mangasport.\n\nMoanda is served by Moanda Railway Station situated outside the city, north of the Bangombe Plateau. Moanda is also home to an airfield, and lies about 50 km to Mvengue Airport, none of which, as of 2016, had any commercial airline service. The city is crossed by the N3 road and is the northern end of the Moanda-Mbinda Road, which connects Moanda to Mbinda, Congo. Moanda Railway Station is the last stop before Franceville, the southern terminus of the Trans-Gabon Railway. The road to the Republic of Congo goes between Mount Moanda and Mount Boundinga.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795816", "title": "Ramón López Velarde", "text": "Ramón López Velarde\n\nRamón López Velarde (June 15, 1888 – June 19, 1921) was a \nMexican poet. His work was a reaction against French-influenced modernismo which, as an expression of a purely Mexican subject matter and emotional experience, is unique. He achieved great fame in his native land, to the point of being considered Mexico's national poet.\n\nLópez Velarde was born in el Marecito, Tepetongo near Jerez de García Salinas, Zacatecas. He was the first of nine children of José Guadalupe López Velarde, a lawyer from Jalisco, and Trinidad Berumen Llamas, who came from a local landowning family. José, after an unsuccessful law career, had founded a Catholic school in Jerez. In 1900, Ramón was sent to a seminary in Zacatecas, where he remained for two years; later, when his family moved, he transferred to a seminary in Aguascalientes. In 1905 he abandoned the seminary in favor of a career in the law.\n\nDuring his years in the seminary, Velarde had spent his holidays in Jerez. During one of these trips, he met Josefa de los Ríos, a distant relative eight years his senior, who made a deep impression on him. The earliest poem ascribed to Velarde, \"Fuensanta\" (1905) is believed to have been inspired by her.\n\nIn 1906 he collaborated on the literary review \"Bohemio\", published in Aguascalientes by some of his friends, under the pseudonym of \"Ricardo Wencer Olivares\". The \"Bohemio\" group sided with Manuel Caballero, a Catholic Integralist opposed to literary modernism, during the controversy surrounding the 1907 reappearance of the polemical \"Revista Azul\". However, their intervention had no appreciable effect on Mexican literary culture.\n\nIn January 1908 Velarde began his law studies at the University of San Luis Potosí. Soon after, his father died, leaving the family, which had returned to Jerez, in a desperate financial situation. Thanks to the support of his maternal uncles, Velarde was able to continue his studies. He continued to collaborate on various publications in Aguascalientes (\"El Observador\", \"El Debate\", \"Nosotros\") and later in Guadalajara (\"El Regional\", \"Pluma y Lápiz\"). \"Bohemia\" had ceased to exist by 1907.\n\nIn San Luis Potosí Velarde read modernist poetry, especially that of Amado Nervo, to whom he will refer as \"our greatest poet\", and Andrés González Blanco. This radically changed his aesthetic sensibilities, transforming him into a fervent defender of modernism. In 1910 he began to write what would later become \"La sangre devota\".\n\nDuring the years of the Mexican Revolution, López Velarde openly supported the political reforms of Francisco Madero, whom he met personally in 1910. In 1911 he received his law degree and became a judge in the small town of Venado. However, he left his position at the end of the year and traveled to Mexico City, hoping that Madero, the new president of the republic, might offer him a position in his government. Madero made no such offer, perhaps because of Velarde's militant Catholicism.\n\nEduardo J. Correa, his old mentor, hired him in 1912 to collaborate on \"La Nación\", a monthly Catholic journal in Mexico City. Velarde wrote poems, reviews, and political commentary about Mexico's new state of affairs. He attacked, among others, Emiliano Zapata. He left the journal soon after the revolt of February 9, 1913, which brought Victoriano Huerta to power. Trying to escape the political turmoil of Mexico City, he returned to San Luis Potosí. He began his courtship of María de Nevares, which he would continue for the rest of his life, unsuccessfully.\n\nAt the beginning of 1914 he settled permanently in Mexico City. In the middle of 1915 the rise to power of Venustiano Carranza began a period of relative tranquility. Mexican poetry was currently dominated by the postmodernism of Enrique González Martínez, for whom Velarde had little admiration. He preferred the work of José Juan Tablada, who was also his good friend. During this period he was also interested in the work of the Argentine modernist Leopoldo Lugones, who left a decisive influence on Velarde's later work.\n\nIn 1915 López Velarde began to write more personal poems, marked by their nostalgia for his native Jerez (to which he would never return), and for his first love, \"Fuensanta\".\n\nIn 1916 he published his first book, \"La sangre devota\" (\"The Pious Blood\"), which he dedicated to \"the spirits\" of the Mexican poets Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera and Manuel José Othón, and was well received by the Mexican literary community. The book – and even its title – concerned the Catholic liturgy, which was associated with the idealized world of the author's childhood in Jerez, and identified as the only refuge from his turbulent city life. The poem \"Viaje al terruño\" is fundamentally an attempt to evoke a return to childhood. Nevertheless, this nostalgia is not free of a certain ironic distance, as in the poem \"Tenías un rebozo de seda...\" he remembers himself as a \"seminarian, without Baudelaire, without rhyme, and without a sense of smell\".\n\nIn 1917, Josefa de los Ríos, the inspiration for \"Fuensanta\", died. Velarde began to work on his next book, \"Zozobra\" (\"Sinking\"), which would not be published for another two years. Between March and July of that year he collaborated with González Martínez on the review \"Pegaso\". Despite receiving increasing criticism for his Catholicism and provincialism, Velarde's literary prestige also began to rise.\n\nIn 1919 Velarde published \"Zozobra\", considered by the majority of critics to be his major work. It was heavily ironic and drew both from his provincial upbringing and his recent experiences in the city. The influence of Lugones was evident in the book's tendency to avoid common settings, the employment of vocabulary then considered unpoetical, of unusual adjectives and unexpected metaphors, the use of word games, the frequency of proparoxytones, and the humorous use of rhyme. In this sense, the work also resembled that of the Uruguayan poet Julio Herrera y Reissig. \"Zozobra\" consists of forty poems arranged cyclically, begun by the line \"Hoy como nunca\" (\"Today as never\"), saying goodbye to Fuensanta and Jerez, and ending with the poem \"Humildemente\" (\"Humbly\"), which marks a symbolic return to his origins. \"Zozobra\" was strongly criticized by González Martínez.\n\nIn 1920 the revolt of Alvaro Obregón brought an end to the government of Carranza, which for Velarde had been a period of stability and great productivity. But after a brief period of unrest in Velarde's life, José Vasconcelos was named minister of education, and promised a cultural renovation of the country. Velarde wrote for two journals promoted by Vasconcelos, \"México Moderno\" and \"El Maestro\". In the latter, Velarde published one of his best-known essays, \"Novedad de la Patria\", where he expounded on the ideas of his earlier poems. Also appearing in \"El Maestro\" was \"La suave patria\", which would cement Velarde's reputation as Mexico's national poet.\n\nVelarde died on June 19, 1921, soon after turning thirty-three. His death was officially attributed to pneumonia, although it was speculated that syphilis might have been to blame. He left behind an unfinished book, \"El son del corazón\" (\"The sound of the heart\"), which would not be published until 1932.\n\nAfter his death, at Vasconcelos' quiet urging, López Velarde was given great honors, and held up as the national poet. His work, especially \"La suave patria\", was presented as the ultimate expression of post-revolutionary Mexican culture. This official appropriation did not preclude others from championing his work. The poets known as the \"Contemporáneos\" saw Velarde, together with Tablada, as the beginning of modern Mexican poetry. Xavier Villaurrutia, in particular, insisted on the centrality of Velarde in the history of Mexican poetry, and compared him to Charles Baudelaire.\n\nThe first complete study of Velarde was made by American author Allen W. Phillips in 1961. This formed the basis for a subsequent study by Octavio Paz, included in his book \"Cuadrivio\" (1963), in which he argued the modernity of López Velarde, comparing him to Jules Laforgue, Leopoldo Lugones and Julio Herrera.\n\nOther critics, such as Gabriel Zaid, centered their analysis on Velarde's formative years and his strong Catholicism. On 1989, on Velarde's one hundredth birthday, Mexican author Guillermo Sheridan published a new biography of the poet, titled \"Un corazón adicto: la vida de Ramón López Velarde\", which remains the most complete biography of Velarde to date.\n\nVelarde's oeuvre marks a moment of transition between modernism and the avant-garde. His work was marked by a novel approach to poetic language. At the same time, it was framed by duality, whether it be the Mexican struggle between rural traditions and the new culture of the cities, or his own struggle between asceticism and pagan sensuality.\n\nDespite his importance, he remains virtually unknown outside his own country.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It's based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nThe style of Tanghetto is a blend of tango and electronic music. Their music is also influenced by world music and jazz. The experimentation in studio started in 2001, however Tanghetto was formed as a band in late 2002 and early 2003. Tanghetto's concept was developed by producer / composer / songwriter Max Masri. Then Max was joined in the project by Diego Velázquez then later joined by various guest musicians. The band's current lineup includes bandoneon, violin, acoustic piano, electronic and acoustic drums, samplers, and synthesizers. The main feature of their music, apart from the balance of electronic and ethnic sounds, is the strong presence of melody and song structure.\n\nTanghetto released their first album, \"Emigrante (electrotango)\" in 2003. It was inspired in the economic crisis that Argentina was facing back in 2001 and also in the feelings of distress generated by the massive exile of many young Argentines, that decided to flee from their country, in a desperate move to find a future. ¨Emigrante¨ was nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards of 2004 in the category of \"Best Instrumental\", and later reached platinum status in Argentina in 2006 and double platinum in 2009. According to The Los Angeles Times, Tanghetto is the most seductive electrotango band that is based in Buenos Aires and the album \"Emigrante\" is \"marked by its languid melodies, its smoky textures and the kind of delicate piano lines that would make Massive Attack proud\". In late 2004 the group released an album from a side project called Hybrid Tango, in which a variety of world music styles are blended with their unique sound, including flamenco, candombe, and jazz. This album was also nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 in the Traditional/ Best Tango Category.\n\nIn early 2005 a compilation of different electronic and neo-tango artists was released in Buenos Aires by the label Constitution Music, under the name Tangophobia Vol. 1 (which was later reissued on iTunes and several online music stores under the name \"Electrotango Sessions\"), including five unreleased tracks by Tanghetto.\n\nIn October 2005 a new album, Buenos Aires Remixed, was released. It's an album that contains 12 remixed versions of Tanghetto songs plus two cover songs (Enjoy the Silence, from Depeche Mode and New Order's Blue Monday). Their version of \"Blue Monday\" became an alternative radio hit in the USA, and a favorite on KCRW radio station in Los Angeles. Buenos Aires Remixed reached gold status in early 2007 and became their second platinum album later that year. In 2005 they released their first controversial video \"Tangocrisis\", with images of the Argentine economic crisis. Their second video from ¨Hybrid Tango¨, \"Barrio Sur\" was their first video with rotation on MTV. In July 2006 they released their first DVD, \"Live in Buenos Aires\".\n\nAfter consistently touring through Europe and the Americas, the band recorded their next studio album, called El Miedo a la Libertad, named after Erich Fromm's classic essay, Fear of Freedom. The album was released on March the 1st, 2008 and in July 2009 it won a Gardel Award, the Argentine equivalent of the Grammy and reached gold status in 2011.\n\nIn late 2009 after their first big tour in Brazil, they released a new studio album called Más Allá del Sur which was also nominated for a Carlos Gardel Award, this time in 2010. In 2011 they released their album VIVO (live around the world) which was recorded during their last two tours. The album also includes a cover version of \"7 Nation Army\" from The White Stripes and an electrotango version of the song \"Computer Love\" by German electro pioneers Kraftwerk. There's a second volume for the \"VIVO\" album dubbed \"VIVO 'Milonguero'\" with 14 live tracks, including unplugged versions recorded during the 2007 BBC Sessions and some bonus tracks, such as Piazzolla's \"Allegro Tangabile\". This album features a notable live version of \"Libertango\" also by the great tango creator Astor Piazzolla. ¨VIVO Milonguero¨ won their second Gardel Award. In late 2012 a concept album called Incidental Tango was released, with the participation of guest arranger / pianist Aldo Di Paolo. For the ¨Incidental Tango¨ album, Masri envisioned the notion that music is always the soundtrack of everyone's life, and thus Tango in all of its forms is the 'incidental music' of life in Buenos Aires. Tanghetto toured all over Europe in 2013, playing in one of the most important venues in London, The O2 Arena, and toured Romania and Poland for the first time. They also toured in Latin America, in Mexico, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Argentina. In 2014 they released the follow up to their 2004 concept album ¨Hybrid Tango¨, named ¨Hybrid Tango II¨. The album consisted of new recorded material and some songs that were not used in other albums but were of excellent artistic quality and were kept for this project. In September 2014 Tanghetto was nominated for the third time to the Latin Grammy's with ¨Hybrid Tango II¨ competing with Ruben Blades who won. In 2015 they released the album \"Progressive Tango\" and got their 6th nomination to the Gardel Awards. ¨Progressive Tango¨, first promo single became the number one song played from Tanghetto in Spotify. With that tour they played in Europe, America and Asia. In 2016 they released the album \"Desenchufado\", it was also nominated to the Gardel Awards becoming their 7th nomination to the most prestigious awards in Argentina in 2017. In 2018 they released the album \"Vivo en Buenos Aires\" recorded at some of the most important music halls of Buenos Aires and it features two new songs. In july 2018 the played for the first time at the iconic Lincoln Center in New York City for 3,000 people. In 2019 They played their most important show in Buenos Aires celebrating 15 years of the \"Emigrante\" Album, playing at the Ballena Azul Symphony Hall, with three legends as special guests: Pedro Aznar, Sandra Mihanovich and Nito Mestre.\n\n\nSpecial guest:\n\n\nAlbums\n\n\nSingles (Promo or digital)\n\n\nTanghetto was nominated to the Latin Grammy Awards for the first time in 2004 in the \"Best Instrumental Album\" category with their album \"Emigrante (electrotango)\", released in late 2003. The category was won by sixteen-time Grammy winner and violoncello virtuoso Yo-Yo Ma. The following year Tanghetto was again nominated for a Latin Grammy, this time in the \"Best Tango Album\" category with their album \"Hybrid Tango\". In 2009 they won their first Gardel Award with their album El Miedo a la Libertad. In 2010 (this time in the World Music category) Tanghetto was nominated again for the Gardel award with their album \"Más Allá Del Sur\". Both live albums \"VIVO\" and \"VIVO\" Milonguero, as well as 2013 studio album ¨Incidental Tango¨, were nominated for \"Best alternative tango album\" in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively for a Gardel award. VIVO Milonguero won the Gardel award in 2012. In 2014 Tanghetto was nominated to the Latin Grammy's for the third time with \"Hybrid Tango II\". Tanghetto got nominated again to the Gardel Awards in 2013, 2016 and 2017 combining seven gardel Award nominations.\n\nIn 2012, as producer and songwriter of Uruguayan tango singer Tabaré Leyton, Max Masri was nominated for two Graffiti awards, one Morosoli and one Iris award. The album \"La Factoría del Tango\" ultimately won one Graffiti (Best Tango Album), the Morosoli Bronze award and the Iris award (Best New Artist).\n\n"}

He held the title of People's Artist of Russia.\n\nIlya Glazunov's paintings have mostly historic or religious themes. Famous works include \"Russia the Eternal\", \"The 20th Century Mystery\", \"The Ruining of the Temple on Easter Night\", and illustrations to the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nIlya Glazunov was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) to Sergey Fyodorovich Glazunov and Olga Konstantinovna Glazunova (née Flug). Both of his parents originally belonged to Russian nobility. His father was a historian. As a child, Glazunov attended a children's school of arts, and later a secondary art school in the historical district of Petrogradskaya Storona.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War he survived the Siege of Leningrad. His father, mother and other relatives died in it. In 1942 the then-eleven-year-old was transported from besieged Leningrad along the Road of Life. He stayed in the village of Greblo in the Novgorod region. In 1944 he returned to Leningrad and studied in the Leningrad Secondary Art School. From 1951 to 1957 he studied art at the I. Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture under the direction of Professor Boris Ioganson.\n\nIn 1956, he married Nina Vinogradova-Benois. He painted the image of Nina in many of his works. Nina Aleksandrovna was a descendant of the Benois family, a familiar name in art history. Her uncle was the artistic director of the La Scala Opera for 30 years. On 24 May 1986, Nina Vinogradova-Benois committed suicide, just a few days before the opening of the exhibition of her husband in Manege. Their children, Ivan and Vera, have both become artists.\n\nGlazunov's success at the International Competition of Young Artists in Prague prompted the opening of his first single exhibition in Moscow in 1957. Soon after in the 1960s, he traveled to Italy for the first time to paint the portraits of many famous actors and actress, including Gina Lollobrigida and Anita Ekberg. He also painted portraits of many political leaders, including Indira Gandhi, Leonid Brezhnev, Urho Kekkonen, Yury Luzhkov and Andrei Gromyko.

Gibson\n\nJames William Gibson (21 October 1877 – September 1951) was a British businessman who was the owner of the English football club Manchester United from December 1931 until his death in September 1951.\n\nThe son of a successful uniform manufacturer, Gibson was born in Salford but brought up in central Manchester with his younger brother, John, and their sister, Florence, who died at a very early age. Tragedy befell the family again when Gibson was 14, as both his parents contracted fatal illnesses and the children went to live with their paternal grandparents. The grandparents died soon after, and the children were taken in by their uncle, their mother's only brother, William Fell. Fell was himself a successful businessman, like the boys' father, and had become a famous corn merchant on the outskirts of the city. Gibson began working with Fell in the corn business, immersing himself in all aspects of the company, but excelling in sales.\n\nJust after the start of the 20th century, after 15 years working for his uncle, Gibson decided to set up his own company. The textiles industry in and around Manchester was booming at the time, so Gibson followed his father into the uniform business, and since his father's name was still fairly well known in the city, he quickly built up a portfolio of contacts. The business grew steadily for several years, before the outbreak of the First World War earned Gibson his first major contract; the company began manufacturing uniforms for the British Armed Forces on a daily basis. This deal forged Gibson's reputation and by the end of the war he had become a well-respected entrepreneur.\n\nHowever, the end of the war also meant that the company was now selling less uniforms and needed a new source of revenue. Not content with anything small-scale, Gibson approached the city corporations with an offer to provide uniforms for the tram drivers and conductors, selling the idea that they would be proud to wear such a uniform. The idea proved a success, and Gibson was able to diversify into other fields outside clothing. Nevertheless, he continued to concentrate on the uniform business and, in 1924, he entered into a partnership with Messrs F. Jones and R. H. H. Briggs, forming Briggs, Jones and Gibson. They relocated the business to larger premises on Lostock Street, near Oldham Road in Collyhurst, and the combined talents of the three men meant further expansion, both in Manchester and in other cities. However, in 1926, Jones died, putting the business under pressure. For reasons thought to be related to his age, Briggs also decided to sell his share in the business, and Gibson took sole control of the company. This coincided with the onset of the Great Depression, which meant a massive downturn in trade. Gibson's interests in other fields meant that the business was able to survive the Depression.\n\nA Salfordian by birth, Gibson was living in Old Trafford in 1911 and was aware of his 'local' football team, who had just moved into their new stadium in the district, although whether he was an active supporter at this time is not known.\n\nUnlike the wealthy Gibson, Manchester United F.C. was being affected greatly by the Great Depression around the start of the 1930s. Their previous owner, John Henry Davies had died in 1927 after 25 years at the club. They had won the FA Cup and two league titles during the first 10 years of his chairmanship and by the time of Davies' death they were developing a reputation as a \"yo-yo\" club who regularly moved between the First and Second Divisions and their future was under threat by large debts.\n\nGibson injected around £40,000 more funds into the team during the Great Depression, though they continued to wander between the First and Second Divisions without looking like serious contenders for either the league title or the FA Cup.\n\nWhen Old Trafford was wrecked by German air raids on 11 March 1941, he also funded the rebuilding of the stadium, which was completed in 1949, and started the United Youth Academy that produced the great Busby Babes side of the mid-to-late 1950s.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, he appointed Matt Busby as manager, but only lived to see Busby bring one major trophy back to Old Trafford – the 1948 FA Cup – as he died in 1951, a year before they won their first top division title since 1911. He did not live to see the revolution of the Busby Babes later in the decade.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795859", "title": "Imparted righteousness", "text": "Imparted righteousness\n\nImparted righteousness, in Methodist theology, is that gracious gift of God given at the moment of the new birth which enables a Christian disciple to strive for holiness and sanctification. John Wesley believed that imparted righteousness worked in tandem with imputed righteousness. \"Imputed righteousness\" is the righteousness of Jesus credited to the Christian, enabling the Christian to be justified; imparted righteousness is what God does in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit \"after\" justification, working in the Christian to enable and empower the process of sanctification (and, in Wesleyan thought, Christian perfection).\n\n\n\nCharles Wesley believed in imparted righteousness. This comes through in the Wesleyan hymnody such as his famous hymn \"And can it be\". The last verse reads:\n\nNo condemnation now I dread;\nJesus, and all in Him, is mine !\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\nAnd clothed in righteousness divine,\nBold I approach the eternal throne,\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\n\nClothed in righteousness divine. Ephesians 6:14 [TNIV] says \"Stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the \"breastplate of righteousness\" in place...\"\n\nPreachers and theologians from various Protestant traditions (not only Wesleyan) use the term \"imparted righteousness\" to identify the righteous principle imparted by God to believers when He regenerates them. Believers thereby become \"partakers of the divine nature\" (cf. 2 Peter 1:4). It is this principle of righteousness imparted to men in regeneration which is ever in conflict with the old Adamic nature. Protestants, however, maintain the distinction between the \"imputed righteousness\" of Christ which is the basis for justification and the \"imparted righteousness\" which is the basis for subsequent sanctification.\n\nIt is somewhat problematic for some Christians (notably Calvinists) to call the doctrine \"imparted righteousness,\" for that which is imparted is a righteous \"principle\" into man's nature, not \"righteousness\" per se. Care must be taken in using the term \"imparted\" righteousness because it is sometimes confused with and sometimes intentionally used to refer to the Roman Catholic doctrine of \"infused righteousness,\" which in Catholicism is the basis for justification.\n\nThis section is a precis of N. T. Wright's work in \"What Saint Paul Really Said\".\n\nN. T. Wright, who is one of the best-known advocates of the New Perspective on Paul, explains that although the \"righteousness of God\" and \"righteousness from God\" have been confused and conflated in the past, they are distinct concepts. He relates the court-room metaphor, pointing out that there are three parties in the Hebrew court - two parties in disagreement and one judge (there is no \"Prosecuting Attorney\"). The judge decides the outcome of the dispute between the parties, declaring one to be correct and the other incorrect. The one who is declared \"correct\" in court is called \"righteous\" in the matter that was judged.\n\nThe \"righteousness of God\", referring to God's (the judge's) faithfulness to the covenant relationship, \"can be neither imputed nor imparted to anybody\" but refers only to His role as judge.\n\n\"Righteousness from God\" is roughly equivalent to \"vindication\", meaning that God is pronouncing that particular party to be correct/vindicated/righteous/acquitted in their dispute with the other party.\n\nThe dispute in question in Christian theology is between those of faith (in God's promises: the covenant, the Messiah), and \"the wicked\", meaning everybody opposed to those of faith. Paul was positing that the people of such faith are vindicated when Messiah returns, being declared \"righteous\" (or in other words, vindicated for their stance), which is exactly the meaning of the Biblical term \"justified\" in N. T. Wright's view.\n\nThis means that we do not \"receive\" the righteousness of God (or as often expressed, \"of Jesus\") as in the classical Evangelical vernacular, nor is it \"infused\" as stated in the classical Roman Catholic vernacular. The \"righteousness of God\" remains His alone, and our \"righteousness from God\" means that we are found to be \"of\" the people of God. Paul's argument is that it has always been so, but what has changed is that the Messiah, in Jesus of Nazareth, has now appeared.\n\nAn important verse to note is 2 Cor 5:21, \"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" (ESV), which has traditionally been interpreted to mean that the Christian has, in some way, become righteous (by impartation or imputation), in exchange for Jesus' sinlessness. In fact, N. T. Wright says, Paul is speaking here \"of the apostles\", and pointing out that \"in their role as apostles\", their activity is effectively God's righteousness (covenant faithfulness) in action (\"we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God\" - vv 20-21). This meaning is natural when taken in context from verse 11 through 21.\n\n\n"}

Schiller\n\nFerdinand Canning Scott Schiller (16 August 1864 – 6 August 1937), usually cited as F. C. S. Schiller, was a German-British philosopher. Born in Altona, Holstein (at that time member of the German Confederation, but under Danish administration), Schiller studied at the University of Oxford, later was a professor there, after being invited back after a brief time at Cornell University. Later in his life he taught at the University of Southern California. In his lifetime he was well known as a philosopher; after his death his work was largely forgotten.\n\nSchiller's philosophy was very similar to and often aligned with the pragmatism of William James, although Schiller referred to it as \"humanism\". He argued vigorously against both logical positivism and associated philosophers (for example, Bertrand Russell) as well as absolute idealism (such as F. H. Bradley).\n\nSchiller was an early supporter of evolution and a founding member of the English Eugenics Society.\n\nBorn in 1864, one of three brothers and the son of Ferdinand Schiller (a Calcutta merchant), Schiller's family home was in Switzerland. Schiller grew up in Rugby. He was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, and graduated in the first class of \"Literae Humaniores\", winning later the Taylorian scholarship for German in 1887. Schiller's first book, \"Riddles of the Sphinx\" (1891), was an immediate success despite his use of a pseudonym because of his fears concerning how the book would be received. Between the years 1893 and 1897 he was an instructor in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1897 he returned to Oxford and became fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi for more than thirty years. Schiller was president of the Aristotelian Society in 1921, and was for many years treasurer of the Mind Association. In 1926 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1929 he was appointed visiting professor in the University of Southern California, and spent half of each year in the United States and half in England. Schiller died in Los Angeles either 6, 7 or 9 August 1937 after a long and lingering illness.\n\nSchiller was a founding member of the English Eugenics Society and published three books on the subject; \"Tantalus or the Future of Man\" (1924), \"Eugenics and Politics\" (1926), and \"Social Decay and Eugenic Reform\" (1932).\n\nIn 1891, F.C.S. Schiller made his first contribution to philosophy anonymously. Schiller feared that in his time of high naturalism, the metaphysical speculations of his \"Riddles of the Sphinx\" were likely to hurt his professional prospects (p. xi, \"Riddles\"). However, Schiller's fear of reprisal from his anti-metaphysical colleagues should not suggest that Schiller was a friend of metaphysics. Like his fellow pragmatists across the ocean, Schiller was attempting to stake out an intermediate position between both the spartan landscape of naturalism and the speculative excesses of the metaphysics of his time. In \"Riddles\" Schiller both, \nThe result, Schiller contends, is that naturalism cannot make sense of the \"higher\" aspects of our world (freewill, consciousness, God, purpose, universals), while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the \"lower\" aspects of our world (the imperfect, change, physicality). In each case we are unable to guide our moral and epistemological \"lower\" lives to the achievement of life's \"higher\" ends, ultimately leading to scepticism on both fronts. For knowledge and morality to be possible, both the world's lower and higher elements must be real; e.g. we need universals (a higher) to make knowledge of particulars (a lower) possible. This would lead Schiller to argue for what he at the time called a \"concrete metaphysics\", but would later call \"humanism\".\n\nShortly after publishing \"Riddles of the Sphinx\", Schiller became acquainted with the work of pragmatist philosopher William James and this changed the course of his career. For a time, Schiller's work became focused on extending and developing James' pragmatism (under Schiller's preferred title, \"humanism\"). Schiller even revised his earlier work \"Riddles of the Sphinx\" to make the nascent pragmatism implicit in that work more explicit. In one of Schiller's most prominent works during this phase of his career, \"Axioms as Postulates\" (1903), Schiller extended James' will to believe doctrine to show how it could be used to justify not only an acceptance of God, but also our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more.\n\nTowards the end of his career, Schiller's pragmatism began to take on a character more distinct from the pragmatism of William James. Schiller's focus became his opposition to formal logic. To understand Schiller's opposition to formal logic, consider the following inference: \nFrom the formal characteristics of this inference alone (All As are Bs; c is not a B; Therefore, c is not an A), formal logic would judge this to be a valid inference. Schiller, however, refused to evaluate the validity of this inference merely on its formal characteristics. Schiller argued that unless we look to the contextual fact regarding what specific problem first prompted this inference to actually occur, we can not determine whether the inference was successful (i.e. pragmatically successful). In the case of this inference, since \"Cerebos is 'salt' for culinary, but not for chemical purposes\", without knowing whether the purpose for this piece of reasoning was culinary or chemical we cannot determine whether this is valid or not. In another example, Schiller discusses the truth of formal mathematics \"1+1=2\" and points out that this equation does not hold if one is discussing drops of water. Schiller's attack on formal logic and formal mathematics never gained much attention from philosophers, however it does share some weak similarities to the contextualist view in contemporary epistemology as well as the views of ordinary language philosophers. \n\nIn \"Riddles\", Schiller gives historical examples of the dangers of abstract metaphysics in the philosophies of Plato, Zeno, and Hegel, portraying Hegel as the worst offender: \"Hegelianism never anywhere gets within sight of a fact, or within touch of reality. And the reason is simple: you cannot, without paying the penalty, substitute abstractions for realities; the thought-symbol cannot do duty for the thing symbolized\".\n\nSchiller argued that the flaw in Hegel's system, as with all systems of abstract metaphysics, is that the world it constructs always proves to be unhelpful in guiding our imperfect, changing, particular, and physical lives to the achievement of the \"higher\" universal Ideals and Ends. For example, Schiller argues that the reality of time and change is intrinsically opposed to the very modus operandi of all systems of abstract metaphysics. He says that the possibility to change is a precondition of any moral action (or action generally), and so any system of abstract metaphysics is bound to lead us into a moral scepticism. \nThe problem lies in the aim of abstract metaphysics for \"interpreting the world in terms of conceptions, which should be true not here and now, but \"eternally\" and independently of Time and Change.\" The result is that metaphysics must use conceptions that have the \"time-aspect of Reality\" abstracted away. Of course, \"[o]nce abstracted from,\"\n\nWhile abstract metaphysics provides us with a world of beauty and purpose and various other \"highers\", it condemns other key aspects of the world we live in as imaginary. The world of abstract metaphysics has no place for imperfect moral agents who (1) strive to learn about the world and then (2) act upon the world to change it for the better. Consequently, abstract metaphysics condemns us as illusionary, and declares our place in the world as unimportant and purposeless. Where abstractions take priority, our concrete lives collapse into scepticism and pessimism.\n\nHe also makes a case against the alternative naturalist method, saying that this too results in an epistemological and moral scepticism. Schiller looks to show this method's inadequacy at moving from the cold, lifeless lower world of atoms to the higher world of ethics, meanings, and minds. As with abstract metaphysics, Schiller attacks naturalism on many fronts: (1) the naturalist method is unable to reduce universals to particulars, (2) the naturalist method is unable to reduce freewill to determinist movements, (3) the naturalist method is unable to reduce emergent properties like consciousness to brain activity, (4) the naturalist method is unable to reduce God into a pantheism, and so on. Just as the abstract method cannot find a place for the lower elements of our world inside the higher, the naturalist method cannot find a place for the higher elements of our world inside the lower. In a reversal of abstract metaphysics, naturalism denies the reality of the higher elements to save the lower. Schiller uses the term \"pseudo-metaphysical\" here instead of naturalism—as he sometimes does—because he is accusing these naturalist philosophers of trying to solve metaphysical problems while sticking to the non-metaphysical \"lower\" aspects of the world (i.e. without engaging in real metaphysics): \n\nTo show that the world's higher elements do not reduce to the lower is not yet to show that naturalism must condemn the world's higher elements as illusionary. A second component to Schiller's attack is showing that naturalism cannot escape its inability to reduce the higher to the lower by asserting that these higher elements evolve from the lower. However, Schiller does not see naturalism as any more capable of explaining the evolution of the higher from the lower than it is capable of reducing the higher to the lower. While evolution does begin with something lower that in turn evolves into something higher, the problem for naturalism is that whatever the starting point for evolution is, it must first be something with the potential to evolve into a higher. For example, the world cannot come into existence from nothing because the potential or \"germ\" of the world is not \"in\" nothing (nothing has no potential, it has nothing; after all, it is nothing). Likewise, biological evolution cannot begin from inanimate matter, because the potential for life is not \"in\" inanimate matter. The following passage shows Schiller applying the same sort of reasoning to the evolution of consciousness:\n\nTaken as the type of the pseudo-metaphysical method, which explains the higher by the lower ... it does not explain the genesis of consciousness out of unconscious matter, because we cannot, or do not, attribute potential consciousness to matter. ... the theory of Evolution derives the [end result] from its germ, i.e., from that which was, what it became, potentially.\n\nUnable to either reduce or explain the evolution of the higher elements of our world, naturalism is left to explain away the higher elements as mere illusions. In doing this, naturalism condemns us to a scepticism in the both epistemology and ethics. It is worth noting, that while Schiller's work has been largely neglected since his death, Schiller's arguments against a naturalistic account of evolution have been recently cited by advocates of intelligent design to establish the existence of a longer history for the view due to legal concerns in the United States (See: Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District).\n\nSchiller argued that both abstract metaphysics and naturalism portray man as holding an intolerable position in the world. He proposed a method that not only recognises the lower world we interact with, but takes into account the higher world of purposes, ideals and abstractions. Schiller: \n\nWe require, then, a method which combines the excellencies of both the pseudo-metaphysical and the abstract metaphysical, if philosophy is to be possible at all.\n\nSchiller was demanding a course correction in field of metaphysics, putting it at the service of science. For example, to explain the creation of the world out of nothing, or to explain the emergence or evolution of the \"higher\" parts of the world, Schiller introduces a divine being who might generate the end (i.e. Final Cause) which gives nothingness, lifelessness, and unconscious matter the purpose (and thus potential) of evolving into higher forms: \n\nAnd thus, so far from dispensing with the need for a Divine First Cause, the theory of evolution, if only we have the faith in science to carry it to its conclusion, and the courage to interpret it, proves irrefragably that no evolution was possible without a pre-existent Deity, and a Deity, moreover, transcendent, non-material and non-phenomenal. ... [T]he world process is the working out of an anterior purpose or idea in the divine consciousness.\n\nThis re-introduction of teleology (which Schiller sometimes calls a re-anthropomorphizing of the world) is what Schiller says the naturalist has become afraid to do. Schiller's method of concrete metaphysics (i.e. his humanism) allows for an appeal to metaphysics when science demands it. However: \n\nSchiller finally reveals what this \"End\" is which \"all things tend\": \n\nIf our speculations have not entirely missed their mark, the world-process will come to an end when all the spirits whom it is designed to harmonise [by its Divine Creator] have been united in a perfect society.\n\nNow, while by today's philosophic standards Schiller's speculations would be considered wildly metaphysical and disconnected from the sciences, compared with the metaphysicians of his day (Hegel, McTaggart, etc.), Schiller saw himself as radically scientific. Schiller gave his philosophy a number of labels during his career. Early on he used the names \"Concrete Metaphysics\" and \"Anthropomorphism\", while later in life tending towards \"Pragmatism\" and particularly \"Humanism\".\n\nSchiller also developed a method of philosophy intended to mix elements of both naturalism and abstract metaphysics in a way that allows us to avoid the twin scepticisms each method collapses into when followed on its own. However, Schiller does not assume that this is enough to justify his humanism over the other two methods. He accepts the possibility that both scepticism and pessimism are true.\n\nTo justify his attempt to occupy the middle ground between naturalism and abstract metaphysics, Schiller makes a move that anticipates James' The Will to Believe: \n\nAnd in action especially we are often forced to act upon slight possibilities. Hence, if it can be shown that our solution is a possible answer, and the only possible alternative to pessimism, to a complete despair of life, it would deserve acceptance, even though it were but a bare possibility.\n\nSchiller contends that in light of the other methods' failure to provide humans with a role and place in the universe, we ought avoid the adoption of these methods. By the end of \"Riddles\", Schiller offers his method of humanism as the only possible method that results in a world where we can navigate our lower existence to the achievement of our higher purpose. He asserts that it is the method we ought to adopt regardless of the evidence against it (\"even though it were but a bare possibility\").\n\nWhile Schiller's will to believe is a central theme of \"Riddle of the Sphinx\" (appearing mainly in the introduction and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In \"Riddles\", Schiller only employs his version of the will to believe doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay \"The Will to Believe\" and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled \"Personal Idealism\", Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled \"Axioms as Postulates\" in which he sets out to justify the \"axioms of logic\" as postulates adopted on the basis of the will to believe doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the will to believe doctrine to be the basis of our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more. He notes that we postulate that nature is uniform because we \"need\" nature to be uniform: \n\n[O]ut of the hurly-burly of events in time and space [we] extract[ ] changeless formulas whose chaste abstraction soars above all reference to any 'where' or 'when,' and thereby renders them blank cheques to be filled up at our pleasure with any figures of the sort. The only question is—Will Nature honour the cheque? Audentes Natura juvat—let us take our life in our hands and try! If we fail, our blood will be on our own hands (or, more probably, in some one else's stomach), but though we fail, we are in no worse case than those who dared not postulate ... Our assumption, therefore, is at least a methodological necessity; it may turn out to be (or be near) a fundamental fact in nature [an axiom].\nSchiller stresses that doctrines like the uniformity of nature must first be postulated on the basis of need (not evidence) and only then \"justified by the evidence of their practical working.\" He attacks both empiricists like John Stuart Mill, who try to conclude that nature is uniform from previous experience, as well as Kantians who conclude that nature is uniform from the preconditions on our understanding. Schiller argues that preconditions are not conclusions, but demands made on our experience that may or may not work. On this success hinges our continued acceptance of the postulate and its eventual promotion to axiom status.\n\nIn \"Axioms and Postulates\" Schiller vindicates the postulation by its success in practice, marking an important shift from \"Riddles of a Sphinx\". In \"Riddles\", Schiller is concerned with the vague aim of connecting the \"higher\" to the \"lower\" so he can avoid scepticism, but by 1903 he has clarified the connection he sees between these two elements. The \"higher\" abstract elements are connected to the lower because they are our inventions for dealing with the lower; their truth depends on their success as tools. Schiller dates the entry of this element into his thinking in his 1892 essay \"Reality and 'Idealism'\" (a mere year after his 1891 \"Riddles\").\n\nThe shift in Schiller's thinking continues in his next published work, \"The Metaphysics of the Time-Process\" (1895): \nThe abstractions of metaphysics, then, exist as explanations of the concrete facts of life, and not the latter as illustrations of the former ... Science [along with humanism] does not refuse to interpret the symbols with which it operates; on the contrary, it is only their applicability to the concrete facts originally abstracted from that is held to justify their use and to establish their 'truth.'\n\nSchiller's accusations against the metaphysician in \"Riddles\" now appear in a more pragmatic light. His objection is similar to one we might make against a worker who constructs a flat-head screwdriver to help him build a home, and who then accuses a screw of unreality when he comes upon a Phillips-screw that his flat-head screwdriver won't fit. In his works after \"Riddles\", Schiller's attack takes the form of reminding the abstract metaphysician that abstractions are meant as tools for dealing with the \"lower\" world of particulars and physicality, and that after constructing abstractions we cannot simply drop the un-abstracted world out of our account. The un-abstracted world is the entire reason for making abstractions in the first place. We did not abstract to reach the unchanging and eternal truths; we abstract to construct an imperfect and rough tool for dealing with life in our particular and concrete world. It is the working of the higher in \"making predictions about the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping our own conduct accordingly\" that justifies the higher. \n\nTo assert this methodological character of eternal truths is not, of course, to deny their validity ... To say that we assume the truth of abstraction because we wish to attain certain ends, is to subordinate theoretic 'truth' to a teleological implication; to say that, the assumption once made, its truth is 'proved' by its practical working ... For the question of the 'practical' working of a truth will always ultimately be found to resolve itself into the question whether we can live by it.\n\nA few lines down from this passage Schiller adds the following footnote in a 1903 reprint of the essay: \"All this seems a very fairly definite anticipation of modern pragmatism.\" Indeed, it resembles the pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's pragmatism was still very different from both that of William James and that of Charles Sanders Peirce.\n\nAs early as 1891 Schiller had independently reached a doctrine very similar to William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore, examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation is to make the same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.\n\nBoth Schiller's theory of truth and meaning (i.e. Schiller's pragmatism) derive their justification from an examination of thought from what he calls his humanist viewpoint (his new name for concrete metaphysics). He informs us that to answer \"what precisely is meant by having a meaning\" will require us to \"raise the prior question of why we think at all.\". A question Schiller of course looks to evolution to provide.\n\nSchiller provides a detailed defence of his pragmatist theories of truth and meaning in a chapter titled \"The Biologic of Judgment\" in \"Logic for Use\" (1929). The account Schiller lays out in many ways resembles some of what Peirce asserts in his \"\" (1877) essay:\n\nThis passage of Schiller was worth quoting at length because of the insight this chapter offers into Schiller's philosophy. In the passage, Schiller makes the claim that thought only occurs when our unthinking habits prove themselves inadequate for handling a particular situation. Schiller's stressing of the genesis of limited occurrences of thought sets Schiller up for his account of meaning and truth.\n\nSchiller asserts that when a person utters a statement in a situation they are doing so for a specific purpose: to solve the problem that habit could not handle alone. The meaning of such a statement is whatever contribution it makes to accomplishing the purpose of this particular occurrence of thought. The truth of the statement will be if it helps accomplishes that purpose. No utterance or thought can be given a meaning or a truth valuation outside the context of one of these particular occurrences of thought. This account of Schiller's is a much more extreme view than even James took.\n\nAt first glance, Schiller appears very similar to James. However, Schiller's more stringent requirement that meaningful statements have consequences \"to some one for some purpose\" makes Schiller's position more extreme than James'. For Schiller, it is not a sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person's goals at a specific moment in time if it is to be meaningful. Therefore, it is not simply enough that the statement \"diamonds are hard\" and the statement \"diamonds are soft\" entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that the experiential difference makes a difference to someone's purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If the experiential difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect up with my purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out \"diamonds are hard\" and then \"diamonds are soft\" to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing. Words can only mean something if they are stated with a specific purpose.\n\nConsequently, Schiller rejects the idea that statements can have meaning or truth when they are looked upon in the abstract, away from a particular context. \"Diamonds are hard\" only possesses meaning when stated (or believed) at some specific situation, by some specific person, uttered (or believed) for some specific aim. It is the consequences the statement holds for that person's purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person's purposes that constitutes the statement's truth or falsity. After all, when we look at the sentence \"diamonds are hard\" in a particular situation we may find it actually has nothing to say about diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply as an example of a sentence with 15 letters. Which the sentence really means cannot be determined without the specific purpose a person might be using the statement for in a specific context.\n\nIn an article titled \"Pragmatism and Pseudo-pragmatism\" Schiller defends his pragmatism against a particular counterexample in a way that sheds considerable light on his pragmatism: \n\nThe impossibility of answering truly the question whether the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal in the evaluation of Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention!\n\nWe might recognise this claim as the sort of absurdity many philosophers try to read into the pragmatism of William James. James, however, would not agree that the meaning of \"the 100th decimal of Pi is 9\" and \"the 100th decimal of Pi is 6\" mean the same thing until someone has a reason to care about any possible difference. Schiller, in constast, does mean to say this. \nJames and Schiller both treat truth as something that happens to a statement, and so James would agree that it only becomes true that the 100th decimal of Pi is 9 when someone in fact believes that statement and it leads them to their goals, but nowhere does James imply that meaning is something that happens to a statement. That is a unique element of Schiller's pragmatism.\n\nWhile Schiller felt greatly indebted to the pragmatism of William James, Schiller was outright hostile to the pragmatism of C.S. Peirce. Both Schiller and James struggled with what Peirce intended with his pragmatism, and both were often baffled by Peirce's insistent rebuffing of what they both saw as the natural elaboration of the pragmatist cornerstone he himself first laid down. On the basis of his misunderstandings, Schiller complains that for Peirce to merely say \"'truths should have practical consequences'\" is to be \"very vague, and hints at no reason for the curious connexion it asserts.\" Schiller goes on to denigrate Peirce's principle as nothing more than a simple truism \"which hardly deserves a permanent place and name in philosophic usage\". After all, Schiller points out, \"[i]t is hard ... to see why even the extremest intellectualism should deny that the difference between the truth and the falsehood of an assertion must show itself in some visible way.\"\n\nWith Peirce's attempts to restrict the use of pragmatism set aside, Schiller unpacks the term \"consequences\" to provide what he considers as a more substantial restatement of Peirce's pragmatism: \n\nFor to say that a [statement] has consequences and that what has none is meaningless, must surely mean that it has a bearing upon some human interest; they must be consequences to some one for some purpose.\n\nSchiller believes his pragmatism to be more developed because of its attention to the fact that the \"consequences\" which make up the meaning and truth of a statement, must always be consequences for someone's particular purposes at some particular time. Continuing his condemnation of the abstract, Schiller contends that the meaning of a concept is not the consequences of some abstract proposition, but what consequences an actual thinker hopes its use will bring about in an actual situation. The meaning of a thought is what consequences one means to bring about when they employ the thought. To Schiller, this is what a more sophisticated pragmatist understands by the term meaning.\n\nIf we are to understand the pragmatic theory of meaning in Schiller's way, he is right to claim that James' theory of truth is a mere corollary of the pragmatist theory of meaning: \n\nBut now, we may ask, how are these 'consequences' to test the 'truth' claimed by the assertion? Only by satisfying or thwarting that purpose, by forwarding or baffling that interest. If they do the one, the assertion is 'good' and pro tanto 'true' ; if they do the other, 'bad' and 'false'. Its 'consequences,' therefore, when investigated, always turn out to involve the 'practical' predicates 'good ' or 'bad,' and to contain a reference to ' practice' in the sense in which we have used that term. So soon as therefore we go beyond an abstract statement of the narrower pragmatism, and ask what in the concrete, and in actual knowing, 'having consequences ' may mean, we develop inevitably the fullblown pragmatism in the wider sense.\n\nGiven Schiller's view that the meaning of a thought amounts to the consequences one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt I were to think to myself, \"Cerebos is salt\", my thought will be true if it consequently leads me to add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture I were to think to myself, \"Cerebos is salt\", my thought would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like \"Cerebos is salt\" means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later ordinary language philosophers, Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of a cotton weaver, and it was his parents' desire that he should become a physician, but, his father's business not being successful, he was unable to continue his studies, and so turned his attention to inventing. He showed an inventive genius at the early age of 14, when he invented a machine to manufacture piping cord, for which he received $100. Before he had reached the age of 18, he had devised a handloom for suspender webbing. His work on \"Stenography\", a short manual on shorthand writing, was written and published about this time. In 1838, he invented a power loom for weaving knotted counterpanes, and later a power loom to weave coach lace and took his brother, Horatio, in with him.\n\nIn 1839 he contracted to produce a power-loom capable of weaving two-ply ingrain carpets, such as had been hitherto woven exclusively by the handloom, which only produced eight yards a day. With his first loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a power loom for weaving \"Brussels\" (i.e. pictorial tapestry) and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important invention, which attracted much attention at the World's Fair in London in 1851. The town of Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, all of which were direct results of his inventive ability. The carpet loom made his name widely known.\n\nBigelow and his brother Horatio are credited with founding the town of Clinton, which was originally part of the town of Lancaster.\nBigelow was elected a member of the Boston Historical Society in April 1864, and in 1869 presented to that society six large volumes entitled \"Inventions of Erastus Brigham Bigelow patented in England from 1837 to 1868\" in which were gathered the printed specifications of eighteen patents granted to him in England. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1866.\n\nIn 1862 Bigelow formulated a scheme of uniform taxation for the United States by means of stamps, and he published \"The Tariff Question, considered in regard to the Policy of England and the Interests of the United States\" (Boston, 1863).\n\nBigelow founded the Bigelow Mechanics Institute in 1846, which is today known as the Bigelow Free Public Library located in Clinton, Massachusetts. He was also an original incorporator of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded in 1861.\n\nBigelow's only child, Helen Bigelow Merriman, became an artist and art collector and one of the founders of the Worcester Art Museum, and his grandson Roger Merriman became a noted historian.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795886", "title": "Record chart", "text": "Record chart\n\nA record chart, also called a music chart, is a ranking of recorded music according to certain criteria during a given period. Many different criteria are used in worldwide charts, often in combination. These include record sales, the amount of radio airplay, the number of downloads, and the amount of streaming activity.\n\nSome charts are specific to a particular musical genre and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.\n\nA common format of radio and television programmes is to run down a music chart.\n\nA \"chart hit\" is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. \"Chart-topper\" and related terms (like \"number one\", \"No. 1 hit\", \"top of the charts\", \"chart hit\", and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from \"buzz charts\" (based on opinions of various experts and tastemakers), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a \"chart-topper\" may be anything from an \"insiders' pick\" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.\n\nRecord chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to music recording sales certification methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.\n\nAccording to Joel Whitburn, the American trade publication \"Billboard\" introduced the Hot 100 on August 4, 1958. This was the first chart in the US to \"fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles.\" From 1958 until 1991, \"Billboard\" compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets. Before 1958, several charts were published, including \"Best Sellers in Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" (later revived under the name Hot 100 Airplay), and \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported. On November 30, 1991, \"Billboard\" introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, \"by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan.\" Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a single. The Hot 100 continues to be published.\n\nThere are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.\n\nA \"new entry\" is a title which is making its début in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real \"new entry\" is a title that makes its chart début, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a \"bubbling under\" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.\n\nA \"re-entry\" is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's \"Thriller 25\"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a \"new\" entry.\n\nA \"climber\" is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term \"highest climber\" is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term \"faller\" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.\n\nThe \"top 10\", \"top 20\" and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the Official Charts Company produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.\n\nA \"one-hit wonder\" is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term \"true one-hit wonder\" was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795888", "title": "Emilio Castelar", "text": "Emilio Castelar\n\nEmilio Castelar y Ripoll (7 September 183225 May 1899) was a Spanish republican politician, and a president of the First Spanish Republic.\n\nCastelar was born in Cádiz. He was an eloquent orator and a writer. Appointed as Head of State in 1873 in the midst of the Third Carlist War and having been given full powers by the Parliament, he ruled by decree. He left office after Pavia's coup d'état the following year.\n\nHe wrote a history of the \"Republican Movement in Europe\" among other works of political interest.\n\nAt the age of seven he lost his father, who had taken an active part in the progressive agitations during the reign of Ferdinand VII, and had spent several years as an exile in England. He attended a grammar school at Sax. In 1848 he began to study law in Madrid, but soon elected to compete for admission to the School of Philosophy and Letters, where he earned a doctorate in 1853. He was an obscure republican student during the Spanish revolutionary movement of 1854, and the young liberals and democrats of that era decided to hold a meeting in the largest theatre of the capital. On that occasion Castelar delivered his maiden speech, which at once placed him in the political vanguard of the reign of Queen Isabella II.\n\nFrom that moment on, he took an active part in politics, radical journalism, and literary and historical pursuits. Castelar was involved in the First Uprising of June 1866, which was organized by Marshal Prim, and crushed, after much bloodshed, in the streets by Marshals O'Donnell and Serrano. A court martial condemned him to death by garrote, and he had to hide at a friend's house until he could escape to France. There he lived two years until the successful Revolution of 1868 allowed him to return and take a seat in the Cortes for the first time as deputy for Zaragoza. At the same time he resumed the professorship of history at the Complutense University of Madrid. Castelar soon became famous for his speeches in the Constituent Cortes of 1869, where he led the republican minority in advocating a federal republic as the logical outcome of the recent revolution. He thus gave much trouble to men like Serrano, Topete and Prim, who had never cherished the idea of establishing an advanced democracy, and who each had his own scheme for re-establishing the monarchy with certain constitutional restrictions. Hence arose Castelar's constant and vigorous criticisms of the successive plans mooted to place a Hohenzollern, a Portuguese, the Duke of Montpensier, Espartero and finally Amadeus of Savoy on the throne. He attacked with relentless vigour the short-lived monarchy of Amadeus, and contributed to its downfall.\n\nAmadeus' abdication led to the proclamation of the Federal Republic. The Senate and Congress, very largely composed of monarchists, permitted themselves to be dragged along into democracy by the republican minority headed by Salmerón, Figueras, Francesc Pi i Margall, and Castelar. The short-lived federal republic from 11 February 1873 to 3 January 1874 was the culmination of the career of Castelar, and his conduct during those eleven months was much praised by the wiser part of his countrymen, though it alienated from him the sympathies of the majority of his sometime friends in the republican ranks.\n\nBefore the Revolution of 1868, Castelar had begun to dissent from the doctrines of the more advanced republicans, and particularly as to the means to be employed for their success. He abhorred bloodshed, disliked mob rule, and did not approve of military . His idea would have been a parliamentary republic on American lines, with some traits of the Swiss constitution to keep in touch with the regionalist and provincialist inclinations of many parts of the Peninsula. He would have placed at the head of his commonwealth a president and Cortes freely elected by the people, ruling the country in a liberal spirit and with due respect for conservative principles, religious traditions, and national unity.\n\nAt first Castelar did his best to work with the other republican members of the first government of the federal republic. He accepted the post of minister for foreign affairs. He even went so far as to side with his colleagues, when serious difficulties arose between the new government and the president of the Cortes, Señor Martos, who was backed by a very imposing commission composed of the most influential conservative members of the last parliament of the Savoyard king, which had suspended its sittings shortly after proclaiming the federal republic. A sharp struggle was carried on for weeks between the executive and this commission, at first presided over by Martos, and, when he resigned, by Salmeron. In the background Serrano and many politicians and military men steadily advocated a in order to avert the triumph of the republicans. The adversaries of the executive were prompted by the captain-general of Madrid, Pavia, who promised the co-operation of the garrison of the capital. The president, Salmeron, and Marshal Serrano himself lacked decision at the last moment, and lost time and many opportunities by which the republican ministers profited. The federal republicans became masters of the situation in the last fortnight of April 1873, and turned the tables on their adversaries by making a peaceful bloodless .\n\nThe battalions and the militia that had assembled in the bullring near Marshal Serrano's house to assist the anti-democratic movement were disarmed, and their leaders, the politicians and generals, were allowed to escape to France or Portugal. The Cortes were dissolved, and the federal and constituent Cortes of the republic convened, but they only sat during the summer of 1873, long enough to show their absolute incapacity, and to convince the executive that the safest policy was to suspend the session for several months.\n\nThis was the darkest period of the annals of the Spanish revolution of 1873–1874. Matters got to such a climax of disorder, disturbance and confusion from the highest to the lowest strata of Spanish society, that the president of the executive, Figueras, deserted his post and fled the country. Pi y Margall and Salmeron, in successive attempts to govern, found no support in the really important and influential elements of Spanish society. Salmeron had even to appeal to such well-known reactionary generals as Pavia, Sanchez, Bregna, and Moriones, to assume the command of the armies in the south and in the north of Spain. Fortunately these officers responded to the call of the executive. In less than five weeks a few thousand men properly handled sufficed to quell the cantonal risings in Cordoba, Seville, Cádiz and Málaga, and the whole of the south might have been soon pacified, if the federal republican ministers had not once more given way to the pressure of the majority of the Cortes, composed of and radical republicans. The president, Salmeron, after showing much indecision, resigned, but not until he had recalled the general in command in Andalusia, Pavia. This resignation was not an unfortunate event for the country, as the federal Cortes not only made Castelar chief of the executive, though his partisans were in a minority in the Parliament, but they gave him much liberty to act, as they decided to suspend the sittings of the house until 2 January 1874. This was the turning-point of the Spanish revolution, as from that day the tide set in towards the successive developments that led to the restoration of the Bourbons.\n\nOn becoming the ruler of Spain at the beginning of September 1873, Castelar at once devoted his attention to the reorganization of the army, whose numbers had dwindled down to about 70,000 men. This force, though aided by considerable bodies of local militia and volunteers in the northern and western provinces, was insufficient to cope with the 60,000 Carlists in arms, and with the still formidable nucleus of cantonalists around Alcoy and Cartagena. To supply the deficiencies Castelar called out more than 100,000 conscripts, who joined the colors in less than six weeks. He selected his generals without respect of politics, sending Moriones to the Basque provinces and Navarre at the head of 20,000 men, Martinez Campos to Catalonia with several thousand, and Lopez Dominguez, the nephew of Marshal Serrano, to begin the land blockade of the last stronghold of the cantonal insurgents, Cartagena, where the crews of Spain's only fleet had joined the revolt.\n\nCastelar next turned his attention to the Church. He renewed direct relations with the Vatican, and at last induced Pope Pius IX to approve his selection of two dignitaries to occupy vacant sees as well as his nominee for the vacant archbishopric of Valencia, a prelate who afterwards became archbishop of Toledo, and remained to the end a close friend of Castelar. He put a stop to all persecutions of the Church and religious orders, and enforced respect of Church property. He attempted to restore some order in the treasury and administration of finance, with a view to obtain ways and means to cover the expense of the three civil wars, Carlist, cantonal and Cuban. The Cuban insurgents gave him much trouble and anxiety, the famous \"Virginius\" Incident nearly leading to a rupture between Spain and the United States. Castelar sent out to Cuba all the reinforcements he could spare, and a new governor-general, Jovellar, whom he peremptorily instructed to crush the mutinous spirit of the Cuban militia, and not allow them to drag Spain into a conflict with the U.S. Acting upon the instructions of Castelar, Jovellar gave up the filibuster vessels, and those of the crew and passengers who had not been summarily shot by General Burriel. Castelar always prided himself on having terminated this incident without too much damage to the prestige of Spain.\n\nAt the end of 1873 Castelar had reason to be satisfied with the results of his efforts, with the military operations in the peninsula, with the assistance he was getting from the middle classes and even from many of the political elements of the Spanish revolution that were not republican. On the other hand, on the eve of the meeting of the federal Cortes, he could indulge in no illusions as to what he had to expect from the bulk of the republicans, who openly dissented from his conservative and conciliatory policy, and announced that they would reverse it on the very day the Cortes met. Warnings came in plenty, and no less a personage than the man he had made captain-general of Madrid, General Pavia, suggested that, if a conflict arose between Castelar and the majority of the Cortes, not only the garrison of Madrid and its chief, but all the armies in the field and their generals, were disposed to stand by the president. Castelar knew too well what such offers meant in the classic land of , and he refused so flatly that Pavia did not renew his advice. The Cortes met on 2 January 1874. The intransigent majority refused to listen to a last eloquent appeal that Castelar made to their patriotism and common sense, and they passed a vote of censure. Castelar resigned. The Cortes went on wrangling for a day and night until, at daybreak on 3 January 1874, General Pavia forcibly ejected the deputies, closed and dissolved the Cortes, and called up Marshal Serrano to form a provisional government.\n\nCastelar kept apart from active politics during the twelve months that Serrano acted as president of the republic. Another finally put an end to it in the last week of December 1874, when Generals Campos at Sagunto, Jovellar at Valencia, Primo de Rivera at Madrid, and Laserna at Logrono, proclaimed Alphonso XII king of Spain. Castelar then went into voluntary exile for fifteen months, at the end of which he was elected deputy for Barcelona. He sat in all subsequent parliaments, and just a month before his death he was elected as representative of Murcia. During that period he became even more estranged from the majority of the republicans. Bitter experience had shown him that their federal doctrines and revolutionary methods could lead to nothing in harmony with the aspirations of the majority of Spaniards. He was elected, to use his own words, \"to defend and to seek the realization of the substance of the program of the Spanish revolution of 1868 by evolution, and legal, peaceful means.\" Hence the contrast between his attitude from 1876 to 1886, during the reign of Alphonso, when he stood in the front rank of the opposition, to defend the reforms of that revolution against Señor Canovas, and his attitude from 1886 to 1891.\n\nIn this latter period Castelar acted as a sort of independent auxiliary of Sagasta and of the Liberal party. As soon as Castelar saw universal suffrage re-established he solemnly declared in the Cortes that his task was accomplished, his political mission at an end, and that he proposed to devote the remainder of his life to those literary, historical, philosophical, and economic studies which he had never neglected even in the busiest days of his political career. Indeed, it was his extraordinary activity and power of assimilation in such directions that allowed him to keep his fellow-countrymen so well informed of what was going on in the outer world.\n\nHis literary and journalistic labors occupied much of his time, and were his chief means of subsistence. He left unfinished a history of Europe in the 19th century. The most conspicuous of his earlier works were: \"A History of Civilization in the First Five Centuries of Christianity\", \"Recollections of Italy\", \"Life of Lord Byron\", \"The History of the Republican Movement in Europe\", \"The Redemption of Slaves\", \"The Religious Revolution\", \"Historical Essays on the Middle Ages\", \"The Eastern Question\", \"Fra Filippo Lippi\", \"History of the Discovery of America\", and some historical novels. Castelar died near Murcia on 25 May 1899, at the age of sixty-six. His funeral at Madrid was an imposing demonstration of the sympathy and respect of all classes and parties.\n\n"}

Their story is developed much further in the sequel, with a traumatic past leading them to fiercely seek their own security. The Ur-Quan's military doctrine becomes a subject of intense internal conflict, leading to a civil war. In \"Star Control 3\", developed by a different team, they ally with the player against a different antagonist and their role is scaled back. \n\nThe Ur-Quan's role in \"Star Control II\" has earned acclaim among the best game villains of all time. Besides their menacing and threatening persona, they are praised for their surprising depth and humanity.\n\nThe Ur-Quan are an alien race of giant predatory caterpillars, who evolved from a fiercely territorial species into a spacefaring civilization. Prior to the events of the games, they were discovered by an evil psychic race called the Dnyarri, who enslaved the Ur-Quan and compelled them to dominate the rest of known space. Using genetic engineering, the Dnyarri separated the original brown Ur-Quan into two sub-species. The green Ur-Quan became the Dnyarri's favored administrators and researchers, and the black Ur-Quan became their designated soldiers.\n\nThe Ur-Quan eventually freed themselves, and formed a galactic empire of their own. The green Ur-Quan were renamed the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za in honor of the Ur-Quan scientist who freed them all. The Kzer-Za moved forward with the 'Path of Now and Forever', a policy of security through enslaving all non-Ur-Quan sentient life, controlling them as either battle thralls, or forever imprisoning them on their home worlds under impenetrable force-fields. The Black Ur-Quan, renamed the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah after their new leader, felt that they could only be safe with the utter annihilation of all non-Ur-Quan life, an ideology they called the 'Eternal Doctrine'. The differing doctrines of the two fiercely territorial species escalated into a civil war. After devastating losses, the Kzer-Za eventually triumphed through the discovery of an enormous ancient battleship created by a lost alien civilization called the Precursors.\n\nBy the time of the games, the Ur-Quan form a Hierarchy of enslaved races, and travel the galaxy enforcing their doctrine of security through slavery. At the climax of \"Star Control II\", the Ur-Quan are defeated when a bomb destroys their ancient Precursor battleship. At the start of \"Star Control 3\", the Ur-Quan join an alliance with the player, but are ultimately undermined by another civil war with the Kohr-Ah.\n\nCreators Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford first conceived of the Ur-Quan for the original \"Star Control\". Reiche describes their character creation process, \"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. 'What do you guys do?' And they tell me.\" Reiche and Ford began with paper illustrations, which led them to implement ships with special abilities, with each character concept inspired by each ship's unique look-and-feel. One large ship had the ability to launch fighters, which led the designers to a creative conclusion - these aliens seemed to have a commanding personality, and they would be an ancient race that plays the role of the main antagonist. Reiche and Ford felt that the word \"Ur\" had ancient connotations, and liked the sound of \"Quan\", and thus the Ur-Quan were created. \n\nThough the first \"Star Control\" had minimal story and lore compared to the sequel, the original \"Star Control\" described the Ur-Quan's story as founders of an evil Hierarchy, a \"rigid union of the ancient Ur-Quan slavers and their minions\". Reiche and Ford wrote the Ur-Quan's motivations for galactic dominance as their desire for slaves, and designed the Ur-Quan's appearance based on a National Geographic image of a predatory caterpillar dangling over its prey. \n\nWhen it came time to write the story for \"Star Control II\", Reiche and Ford started by using the first game's characters and ships to tell simple visual stories about their fictional conflicts. The Ur-Quan were already understood as a race of slavers in \"Star Control\", so the writers developed their motivation by imagining them as former slaves themselves. Reiche attempted to humanize the Ur-Quan, based on his own \"relationships with people who had experienced significant childhood abuse and how those traumas produced distinctly odd behaviors in adults. [The Ur-Quan's] doctrines were the overtly crazy but internally reasonable responses to their treatment by the Dnyarri, and the pain they had to endure to win their freedom from slavery.\" The team describes this writing process as imagining justifications for past creative decisions, building logically on details about story, artwork, and game abilities. \n\nThe 3DO version of \"Star Control II\" features the voice of Larry Zee for the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za, and David Bryce for the Ur-Quan Kohr Ah. The Ur-Quan theme music for \"Star Control II\" was created by fantasy artist Erol Otus, who first composed the song on a synthesizer before it was re-sampled and exported to MOD file format.\n\nThe Ur-Quan have been described by gaming publications among the best science fiction races ever created. GameSpot ranked the Ur-Quan as the best computer game villain in 1999, explaining how their \"masochistic and truly sad history makes the Ur-Quan one of the very best villains. Even now, we are hard-pressed to find a race of adversaries as complex and three-dimensional as the Ur-Quan.\" They later published a reader-voted list, where fans chose the Ur-Quan as the 4th greatest game villains ever. Praising the complexity of the Ur-Quan, Rock, Paper, Shotgun explains that \"part of \"Star Control II\" is slowly learning that the Ur-Quan aren't actually as bad as they seem\", and declares the Ur-Quan a \"galactic threat better than basically any science fiction role-playing video game that came after\". Retro Gamer applauds the voice acting and dialog for the Ur-Quan, including the \"absolute dread caused by hearing in-depth explanations of what it's like to wear a 'pain excruciator'\". \n\n\"Star Control 3\" was developed and written by a different team. Hardcore Gaming 101 lamented the Ur-Quan's new allied role in the third game, explaining that \"as menacing as the Ur-Quan were in \"Star Control II\", and how cool it is that they're on your side in this game, they barely do anything here.\"\n\n"}

He was known for defining a style of Haitian \"compas\" music he called \"kompa mamba\", and for the sometimes bawdy innuendo used in his songs. During his career, he was one of Haiti's most prominent musicians, and found much success in West Africa as well.\n\nAs a young man, he received a classical music education and worked as a cabinetmaker before becoming a professional football player. It was from football, playing defense for the Port-au-Prince club Aigles Noirs, that he acquired his nickname, \"Coupé Cloué\" or \"cut and nailed\".\n\nHe began performing on guitar in 1951, and in 1957 he formed the band Trio Crystal, which he later renamed Trio Select, along with another guitar player and a maraca player. Their first album, one of the dozens Henry released during his career, was released in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s the group expanded from its original three, and renamed itself Ensemble Select. That decade also saw an increase in his use of racy spoken preaching and storytelling in addition to singing during songs; this became one of his trademarks.\n\nIn 1978 Coupé Cloué toured extensively in Africa, greatly increasing his international prominence. His popularity in West Africa was especially boosted by similarities between the rhythms and sounds of Henry's music an African \"soukous\" music. It was there that Henry earned the nickname, \"Roi Coupé\" (or \"King Coupé\"). During the 1980s and early 1990s, Henry continued to perform and record prolifically.\n\nHenry died of diabetes in January 1998, having only retired from performing the previous month. He was mourned in Port-au-Prince by a day-long outdoor funeral celebration, attended by thousands of people, including the interim Minister of Culture.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795927", "title": "Russian Greek Catholic Church", "text": "Russian Greek Catholic Church\n\nThe Russian Greek Catholic Church (, \"Rossiyskaya greko-katolicheskaya tserkov\"), or Russian Catholic Church, is a \"sui iuris\" Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Church. Historically, it represents the first reunion of members of the Russian Orthodox Church with the Roman Catholic Church. It is now in full communion with and subject to the authority of the Pope as defined by Eastern canon law. \n\nRussian Catholics historically had their own episcopal hierarchy in the Russian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Russia and the Russian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Harbin, China. However, these offices are currently vacant. Their few parishes are served by priests ordained in other Eastern Catholic Churches, former Orthodox priests, and Roman Catholic priests with bi-ritual faculties.\n\nIn Russia, it is purported that after the gradual development of the East-West Schism, a tiny group of Russian families maintained themselves as \"Old Catholics\" (Rus: старокатолики (starokatoliki)), a name which should not be confused with the Döllingerite Old Catholic church of Europe and the United States, which formally split with the Roman Catholic Church in the wake of the reforms of the First Vatican Council. The status of this group of Russian \"Old Catholics\", families and groups of individuals to whom the union with Rome remains essential, and its relation to the current Russian Catholic Church, still remains unclear.\n\nThe modern Russian Catholic Church owes much to the inspiration of poet and philosopher Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov (1853–1900), who urged, following Dante, that, just as the world needed the Tsar as a universal monarch, the Church needed the Pope of Rome as a universal ecclesiastical hierarch. Following Solovyov's teachings a Russian Orthodox priest, Nicholas Tolstoy, entered into full communion with the See of Rome under the Melkite Greek-Catholic, Byzantine Rite Patriarchate of Antioch. Solovyov received sacramental Extreme Unction from Father Tolstoy believing that in doing so he remained also a faithful member of the Russian Orthodox Church. Orthodox authorities refer to Tolstoy as an apostate and \"ex-priest\", but tend to imply that Solovyov still died an Orthodox Christian. Nevertheless, Solovyov never retracted his sentiments in favor of union with the Catholic Church and the See of Rome, and to this day, many Russian Catholics refer to themselves as members of the 'Russian \"Orthodox\" Church in communion with Rome'.\n\nByzantine-rite Catholicism was illegal in the Tsarist Russian empire through the 1800s and until 1905, when Tsar Nicholas II granted religious tolerance. Thereafter, communities of Greek Catholics emerged and became organized. Old Believers were prominent in the early years of the movement. In 1917, Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky appointed the first Apostolic Exarchate for Russian Catholics with Most Reverend Leonid Feodorov, formerly a Russian Orthodox seminarian, as Exarch. However, the October Revolution soon followed, dispersing Russian-Rite Catholics into the Siberian prison camps and the centers of the Russian diaspora throughout the world. In the spring of 1923, Exarch Leonid Feodorov was prosecuted for counterrevolution by Nikolai Krylenko and sentenced to ten years in the Soviet concentration camp at Solovki. Released in 1932, he died three years later. He was beatified in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn 1928, a second Apostolic Exarchate was set up, for the Russian Catholics in China, based in Harbin, the Russian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Harbin.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, some Russian Catholics began to appear in the open. In a 2005 article, Russian Catholic priest Sergei Golovanov stated that three Russian Catholic priests served on Russian soil celebrating the Russian Byzantine Divine Liturgy. Two of them used the recension of the Russian Liturgy as reformed by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow in 1666. The other priest used the medieval rite of the Old Believers, that is to say, as the Russian liturgical recension existed before Patriarch Nikon's reforms of the Russian Liturgy. All Eastern Catholics in the Russian Federation strictly maintain the use of Church Slavonic, although vernacular Liturgies are more common in the Russian diaspora.\n\n\"In 1807 the Russian Empire continued to appoint its own primates for the Ruthenian Uniate Church without confirming them with the Pope. \"<br>\nMetropolitans of Kiev:\n\"Following the Synod of Polatsk (1838), the Ruthenian Uniate Church was forcibly abolished on the territory of the Russian Empire, and its property, clergy, and laity were forcibly transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.\"\n\nIt is vacant since 1951, having had only two incumbents, both belonging to the Ukrainian Studite Monks (M.S.U., a Byzantine Rite Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church monastic order):\n\nWith the religious freedom experienced after the fall of Communism, there were calls from the small number of Russian Catholics to appoint an Exarch to the long existing vacancy. Such a move would have been strongly objected to by the Russian Orthodox Church, causing the Holy See to not act out of ecumenical concerns. In 2004, however, the Vatican's hand was forced when a convocation of Russian Catholic priests in the territory of the vacant exarchate used their rights under canon law to elect a Father Sergey Golovanov as temporary administrator. The Vatican then moved quickly to replace Father Sergey with Bishop Joseph Werth, the Latin Church Apostolic Administrator of Siberia, based in Novosibirsk. He was appointed by Pope John Paul II as Ordinary for all Eastern Catholics in the Russian Federation. As of 2010, five parishes have been registered with civil authorities in Siberia, while in Moscow two parishes and a pastoral center operate without official registration. There are also communities in Saint Petersburg and Obninsk. By 2018, there have been reports of 13 parishes and five pastoral points in Siberia with seven parishes and three pastoral points in European Russia. Some parishes serve the Ukrainian community. The Ordinariate has minimal structure. A Byzantine Catholic mitered archpriest serves as Secretary to the Ordinary. There is a priest coordinator for the parishes in Siberia and a liturgical commission and a catechetical commission.\n\nOutside Russia, there are Russian Catholic parishes and faith communities in San Francisco, New York City, El Segundo, Denver, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Dublin, Meudon, Paris, Chevetogne, Lyon, Munich, Rome, Milan, and Singapore. They are all under the jurisdiction of the respective local Roman Rite bishops. The communities in Denver, Dublin and Singapore do not have a Russian national character – but exist for local Catholics who wish to worship in the Russo-Byzantine style.\n\nAs of 2014, the two Exarchates of Russia and Harbin are still listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as extant, but they have not yet been reconstituted, nor have new Russian-Rite bishops been appointed to head them.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795938", "title": "Frontier in Space", "text": "Frontier in Space\n\nFrontier in Space is the third serial of the tenth season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". The serial was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 24 February to 31 March 1973. It was the last serial to feature Roger Delgado in the role of the Master.\n\nThe serial is set on the Earth, the Moon, Draconia, and the home planet of the Ogrons in the 26th century. In the serial, the Daleks employ the Master to provoke a war between the humans and the Draconians' galactic empires.\n\nAs the Earth cargo ship C982 moves through hyperspace, it narrowly avoids a collision with the TARDIS. As the Third Doctor determines that they are in the 26th century, Jo sees a ship come alongside. Before her eyes, the ship shimmers, changing shape, turning into a Draconian Galaxy-class battlecruiser. The two pilots, Stewart and Hardy, send out a distress signal and prepare for battle. When Hardy goes to get weapons, he meets the Doctor, but sees him and Jo as Draconians. Hardy escorts them at gunpoint to the ship.\n\nOn Earth, the President and the Draconian ambassador (who is also the Emperor's son) accuse each other of attacking the other's ships and violating the frontier established by treaty between the two empires. General Williams reports to the President that a mission to rescue C982 is being prepared. Williams's hostility against the Draconians is well known — it was his actions that started the original war between the two sides and the Prince believes Williams wants war again, a war the Prince warns the President that will see Earth destroyed. News of the attack spreads and anti-Draconian riots break out on Earth, with the opposition calling for the government to take action.\n\nLocked up in C982's hold, the Doctor deduces that the strange sound was some kind of sonic hypnosis device that caused Hardy to hallucinate and see what he most feared. As the enemy boarding party burns its way through the airlocks, Hardy gets the Doctor and Jo to use as hostages, but when the airlock door bursts open, the boarders are not Draconians, but Ogrons. The Ogrons' energy weapons stun the two pilots and the Doctor. They then tie Jo up, taking the ship's cargo and the TARDIS as they leave. When the Doctor revives and releases Jo, she tells him what the Ogrons did, and wonders if they are working for the Daleks, as they were when she first met them. The Doctor points out, however, that the Ogrons are mercenaries.\n\nWhen the rescue party arrives, Hardy and Stewart have stopped hallucinating, but with their memories garbled, accuse the Doctor and Jo of being Draconian spies...\n\nThe two travellers get locked up again as C982 heads back to Earth. General Williams believes they are human agents planted by the Draconians to sabotage any war effort by Earth. He brings the two travellers to confront the Draconian Prince, but the Doctor denies working for the Draconians. He tries to convince the President that a third party is trying to provoke the two empires into war. However, as he can provide no reason why someone would want to, Williams orders the Doctor and Jo be taken away and vows he will get the truth out of them.\n\nIn the Draconian embassy, the Prince arranges to help Jo and the Doctor \"escape\" so that they can be questioned. When the two are escorted from their cell to be brought to the President, a Draconian squad attacks, taking the Doctor prisoner. When Jo tries to get more guards to help, she is arrested instead. The Draconians question the Doctor, believing that he is involved in a plot with Williams to provoke a new war. The Doctor manages to escape the embassy, but is recaptured in the compound by Earth troops. Once back in the cell with Jo, however, she hears the same sound as on C982. Outside, the Ogrons raid the prison, being seen as Draconians thanks to the hypnosound. They break into the Doctor's cell and order him to go with them.\n\nThe second escape goes no better than the first: the Doctor is recaptured yet again and the Ogrons disappear. This second \"rescue attempt\" cements Williams' suspicions, making him demand that the President give him the authority to strike first against the Draconians. The President agrees to break off diplomatic relations but will not go further without conclusive proof.\n\nWilliams places the Doctor under a mind probe, but it indicates the Doctor is telling the truth. Refusing to believe it, Williams orders increased power, but eventually the probe overloads. The President orders that the Doctor be sent to the Lunar Penal Colony where political prisoners are exiled for life, while Jo remains on Earth. Williams and the President receive records from the Dominion government of Sirius IV, an Earth colony planet that has achieved a degree of autonomy from Earth. The records \"prove\" the Doctor and Jo are citizens of Sirius IV as well as career criminals. A commissioner from the Dominion has arrived to claim jurisdiction — who is in actuality the Doctor's old enemy, the Master.\n\nOn the Moon, the Doctor meets Professor Dale of the Peace Party, who shows him around. The Doctor tries to get Dale to trust him and include him in his plans for escape. On Earth, Jo of course recognises the Master immediately, and surmises correctly that he was behind the Ogron attacks. The Master found out about the Doctor and Jo's presence when the Ogrons brought him the TARDIS. Given the unsavoury choice of going with the Master or staying in her cell, Jo agrees to go with him to fetch the Doctor.\n\nDespite his fantastic story, Dale believes the Doctor. The peace with the Draconians lasted many years, but suddenly devolved into senseless acts of hostility. The Doctor's story would explain a great deal. Dale outlines the escape plan: Cross, one of the overseers, will leave two spacesuits near an airlock, and they will walk across the lunar surface to steal a spaceship. Dale offers to take the Doctor back to Earth where he can tell his story to Dale's contacts in the press and government. However, once inside the airlock, they find oxygen tanks for the suits are empty. Cross has double-crossed them, and the room is depressurising.\n\nAt the last moment, the Master arrives and restores the room's atmosphere. The Master obtains custody of the Doctor, and gets the Doctor to come along quietly by revealing that he has Jo. Reunited with Jo in a cell in the Master's ship, the Doctor wonders why he is still alive. The Master explains that his employers are very interested in the Doctor. The Master sets the automatic controls for the Ogron homeworld. Under the cover of telling Jo stories of his life, the Doctor uses a hidden steel wire to file his way through the hinges of the cell. While Jo blocks the security camera and natters on, pretending to continue their conversation, the Doctor sneaks out. Donning a spacesuit, the Doctor exits the ship and makes his way to the flight deck. The Master puts Jo in an airlock, threatening to eject her into space if the Doctor does not surrender, but the Doctor takes him by surprise. As the two face off, they do not notice a Draconian battlecruiser approaching. It docks, and enters the airlock where Jo is located.\n\nThe Draconian captain informs them that, as all diplomatic relations with Earth have been severed, violating Draconian space is punishable by death. The Doctor says he has vital evidence for the Emperor and asks to speak to him. The captain decides to lock up all three of them and take them back to Draconia. However, the Master secretly activates a device whose signal is picked up by the Ogrons.\n\nAs the ship arrives on Draconia, the Prince is speaking with his father, asking him for permission to strike first at Earth. The Emperor, like the President, is hesitant, as he knows such a war could bring down both empires.\n\nThe Doctor, Jo and the Master are presented to the Emperor and the Doctor gives the ritual greeting, \"My life at your command.\" The Prince is incensed that the Doctor has the temerity to address the Emperor like a Draconian noble, but the Doctor says that he \"is\" a noble of Draconia — the title was given him by the 15th Emperor, five centuries before when he aided Draconia against a plague from outer space. The Doctor accuses the Master of trying to instigate a war between Earth and Draconia using Ogrons and the hypnosound device. As the Emperor considers this, a courtier announces that an Earth spaceship has arrived. Jo hears the sound of the sonic device, and realises it is the Ogrons. They burst in, guns blazing, and retreat with the Master, leaving several dead Draconians in their wake. One Ogron has been knocked out by the Doctor, and as the effects of the hypnosound fade, the Emperor sees the \"Earthman\" before him transform into its true form. He then realises the Doctor is speaking the truth.\n\nThe Emperor determines that the Ogron must be shown to the Earth authorities, but as a Draconian ship would be shot down, the Prince, the Doctor and Jo will take the Master's police ship. As they cross the frontier into Earth space, they spot another ship following them. However, by the time they identify it as the Ogron ship, it has already launched its missiles. As the Doctor takes evasive action, the captive Ogron breaks out of its cell, overpowering its Draconian guard. It enters the flight deck and in the struggle cuts the ship's speed. The Prince and the Doctor subdue the Ogron, but the Master's ship catches up and a party boards the police ship. A firefight breaks out on the flight deck, just as an Earth battlecruiser shows up. The Master recalls the boarding party, who take Jo captive along with rescuing the Ogron prisoner, and their ship zips away. The Earth battlercruiser places the Doctor's ship under arrest.\n\nWithout the Ogron, the President is not convinced. The Doctor suggests an expedition to the Ogron homeworld, but Williams thinks it is a Draconian trick to divide Earth's forces. The Prince expects such a response from Williams — after all, he started the first war. Williams protests, but the Prince reveals what is in the Draconian court records. Twenty years before, the Draconians sent a battlecruiser to meet the Earth Empire on a diplomatic mission. When the Draconian ship did not answer the Earth ship's hails, Williams gave the order to attack, believing that the Draconian ship was about to attack his damaged vessel. The battlecruiser was unarmed, its missile banks empty, and the reason it did not answer was because its communications systems were destroyed in a neutron storm, the same storm that had damaged Williams's ship. Williams is shaken by the Prince's revelation and apologises for the wrong he had done to the Draconians. Williams now intends to lead the expedition to the Ogron planet himself.\n\nThe Master brings Jo to a bunker on the Ogron homeworld, where he shows her the TARDIS, which he plans to use as bait for the Doctor in addition to Jo herself. He tries to hypnotise Jo, first with his own powers and then with the hypnosound.\n\nHowever, Jo's mind is strong enough to resist, and the Master orders her to be taken away. An Ogron reports that one of their ships found and attacked two Earth cargo ships, destroying one. The Master is delighted, as this means that war is not far off, and indeed, demands for war from Earth are at a fever pitch.\n\nWilliams prepares his personal scout ship, with the Doctor and the Prince accompanying and heads at maximum speed to the coordinates the Doctor took from the Master's ship. Jo manages to dig her way into the next, unlocked cell and sneak further into the bunker as Williams's ship enters orbit. She pockets the hypnosound, then finds a pad with the coordinates of the planet and bunker on it and transmits a distress signal with the information. The Master shows up, revealing that the signal was muted, and the only person who could have picked it up was the Doctor, whose ship he detected in orbit around the planet. When the Doctor comes, the trap will be sprung.\n\nWilliams's crew lands the scout nearby, not knowing the Ogrons have set up an ambush. The Ogrons open fire on the landing party, but are frightened away by an orange, slug-like lizard they call the Eater. The Master is furious, and warns the Ogrons that their masters are coming, which makes them even more terrified than they were of the monster. Williams's party hears the roar of a spaceship landing, and when they look up on the ridge, they see the Master... accompanied by several Daleks, who exterminate Williams's men before they can even fire. The Daleks want to exterminate the Doctor immediately, but the Master proposes that the Doctor be placed in his hands, to be allowed to see the galaxy and Earth in ruins before they kill him. The Gold Dalek agrees, and leaves for its ship, to go and prepare the Dalek army on another planet.\n\nAnswering the Prince's question, the Doctor explains that the Daleks want a war between Earth and Draconia so both empires will destroy each other, and then the Daleks can pick up the pieces. The Doctor modifies the stolen hypnosound, making the Ogron guard see him as the Gold Dalek, and in fear, it unlocks the gate to the cell. The Doctor tells Williams and the Prince to get the word back to their respective governments and mount a joint expedition against the base on the Ogron planet. The Doctor and Jo find their way to the TARDIS, but are surrounded by the Ogrons and the Master, who trains a blaster on the Doctor. The Doctor activates the hypnosound, panicking the Ogrons. One knocks the Master's arm, making him fire, the shot grazing the Doctor's head. The Master and the Ogrons scatter.\n\nThe Doctor, barely conscious, asks Jo to help him into the TARDIS. He staggers over to the console, dematerialising the ship then pressing his palms to the telepathic circuits. He is sending a message to the Time Lords.\n\nThe titles for \"Frontier in Space\" were prepared, like \"Carnival of Monsters\", with a new arrangement of the theme music performed by Paddy Kingsland on a synthesiser. Known as the \"Delaware\" arrangement (the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was based on Delaware Road in west London), it proved unpopular with BBC executives, so the original Delia Derbyshire theme was restored, although an early edit of episode 5 still contains the \"Delaware\" music and was used for the VHS release.\n\nThe 3 Daleks which appear in the final episode were the same props which had been used in Day of the Daleks.\n\nThe final sequence in the Master's headquarters was intended to contain the giant Ogron-eating monster, but director Paul Bernard did not like the costume and omitted it, leaving the scene with just frightened Ogrons running away from something unseen. Producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks felt the sequence lacked impact and a new ending was filmed in the TARDIS as part of the first production block of the following story, \"Planet of the Daleks\". \"Frontier in Space\" was Paul Bernard's last \"Doctor Who\" work.\n\nJon Pertwee considered the Draconians to be his favourite monster as the rubber and latex masks used allowed the actors playing them to employ a full range of facial expressions. Recalling the production of this story he noted that filming near the Haywood Gallery at the South Bank was made difficult due to a number of \"homeless people and drunks\" lying a round the area. According to Pertwee, Paul Bernard asked the stuntmen and actors who were on location in costume as Ogrons to ask these people to move to allowing filming to proceed.\n\nWhen the wiping of episodes ended in 1978 it was discovered that episodes 1, 2, 3 & 6 had only survived as black and white telerecordings for overseas sales. In the mid-1980s PAL copies were returned from broadcasters in Australia.\n\nThis would be the last appearance of Roger Delgado as the Master, his final scene being the confusion outside the TARDIS with his shooting the Doctor, perhaps accidentally, then disappearing with the panicking Ogrons. Roger Delgado was killed in a car crash in Turkey less than three months after this episode's UK broadcast.\n\nJohn Woodnutt had previously played Hibbert in \"Spearhead from Space\" (1970) and would later play the dual roles of Broton and the Duke of Forgill in \"Terror of the Zygons\" (1975) as well as Seron in \"The Keeper of Traken\" (1981). Luan Peters had previously appeared in \"The Macra Terror\" (1967) under her stage name Karol Keyes. Caroline Hunt previously appeared in \"The Reign of Terror\" (1964). Louis Mahoney later appeared as Ponti in \"Planet of Evil\" (1975) and as Billy Shipton in \"Blink\" (2007).\n\nHarold Goldblatt had previously appeared with Jon Pertwee in a 1938 radio production in Belfast entitled \"Lillibullero\", which was one of Pertwee's earliest radio performances.\n\nA caption slide from the end credits of Episode One was reused accidentally for Episode Two. This resulted in Lawrence Davison (Draconian First Secretary) and Timothy Craven (Cell Guard) not being credited on-screen, though they were billed in \"Radio Times\", and Louis Mahoney (Newscaster) and Roy Pattison (Draconian Space Pilot) – both of whom appeared only in Episode One – being repeated.\n\nAccording to the BBC's Audience Research Report, \"Frontier in Space\" was well received by viewers at the time of broadcast. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), \"Worthy, very well directed and designed to the hilt with a solid costuming policy for both empires. However, it's obviously padded in parts.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the story worked \"brilliantly\", with the production design \"[putting] the whole thing on a suitably grand scale\". \n\nIn 2010, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" awarded it four stars out of five and recalled that it was \"surprising and exciting\" on first viewing, though in retrospect it seemed to be \"a lumbering wannabe-epic with screeds of padding, duff cliffhangers and endless scenes of the Doctor and Jo banged up\". He praised the Draconians and Ogrons, but felt that \"the fact that the heroes spend perhaps two-thirds of the story locked up is tiresome and cannot be overlooked\". DVD Talk's John Sinnott noted that the story was \"talky\" and had a lot of padding, but that it got \"much better\" when the Master was revealed. In the book \"Doctor Who: The Episode Guide\", Mark Campbell awarded it four out of ten, describing it as \"an overlong and uninteresting space opera—a genre \"Doctor Who\" has never done well. Delgado's exit is particularly badly handled.\"\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in September 1976 under the title \"Doctor Who and the Space War\". This was the last time Target would give a novelisation a substantially different title than that of the serial on which it was based. The novel abandons the cliffhanger ending of the televised program and has the Doctor simply leaving the Master on the Ogron world to pursue the Daleks. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Geoffrey Beevers was released on CD in February 2008 by BBC Audiobooks.\n\nThe story was released on VHS in August 1995. Episode 5 uses the \"Delaware\" music mentioned above. The final episode of this story was also issued on \"The Pertwee Years\" VHS release, along with the final episodes of both \"Inferno\" (1970) and \"The Dæmons\" (1971). The serial was released on DVD on 5 October 2009 as part of the box set \"Dalek War\", alongside \"Planet of the Daleks\". It was released on Blu-ray as part of \"The Collection - Season 10\" boxed set in July 2019.\n\n"}

{"id": "1795942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795942", "title": "Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward", "text": "Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward\n\nElizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward (August 31, 1844January 28, 1911) was an early feminist American author and intellectual who challenged traditional Christian beliefs of the afterlife, challenged women's traditional roles in marriage and family, and advocated clothing reform for women.\n\nIn 1868, three years after the Civil War ended, she published \"The Gates Ajar\", which depicted the afterlife as a place replete with the comforts of domestic life and where families would be reunited—along with family pets—through eternity.\n\nIn her 40s, Phelps broke convention again when she married a man 17 years her junior. Later in life she urged women to burn their corsets. Her later writing focused on feminine ideals and women's financial dependence on men in marriage. She was the first woman to present a lecture series at Boston University. During her lifetime she was the author of 57 volumes of fiction, poetry and essays. In all of these works she challenged the prevailing view that woman's place and fulfilment resided in the home. Instead Phelps' work depicted women as succeeding in nontraditional careers as physicians, ministers, and artists.\n\nNear the end of her life, Phelps became very active in the antivivisection movement. Her novel, \"Trixy\", published in 1904, was constructed around the topic of vivisection and the effect this kind of training had on doctors. The book became a standard polemic against experimentation on animals.\n\nElizabeth (August 31, 1844January 28, 1911) was born in Boston, Massachusetts to American Congregational minister Austin Phelps and Elizabeth Wooster Stuart Phelps (1815–1852). Her baptismal name was Mary Gray Phelps, after a close friend of her mother's. Her mother wrote the Kitty Brown series of books for girls under the pen name H. Trusta. Her brother, Moses Stuart Phelps, was born in 1849. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Moses Stuart, the eminent president of Andover Theological Seminary. Her mother was intermittentantly ill for most of her adult life and died of brain fever shortly after the birth of their third child, Amos, on November 20, 1852, Then eight years old, Mary Gray asked to be renamed in honor of her mother.\n\nHer father Austin Phelps was a widely respected Congregational minister and educator. He was pastor of the Pine Street Congregational Church until 1848, when he accepted a position as the Chair of Rhetoric at Andover Theological Seminary. He met Elizabeth Phelps that same year and they were married in the fall. The family moved to Boston and in 1869 he became President of the Andover Theological Seminary, where he served in that role for 10 years. His writings became standard textbooks for Christian theological education and remain in print today.\n\nTwo years after her mother' death, Elizabeth's father married her mother's sister, Mary Stuart. She was also a writer but died of tuberculosis only 18 months later. Less than six months later her father married Mary Ann Johnson, the sister to a minister, and they had two sons, Francis Johnson (1860) and Edward Johnson (1863).\n\nPhelps received an upper class education, attending the Abbot Academy and Mrs. Edwards' School for Young Ladies. She had a gift for telling stories as a child. One source noted, \"She spun amazing yarns for the children she played with... and her schoolmates of the time a little farther on talk with vivid interest of the stories she used to improvise for their entertainment. At thirteen, she had a story published in \"Youth's Companion\" and other stories appeared in Sunday School publications.\n\nIn most of her writings she used her mother's name \"Elizabeth Stuart Phelps\" as a pseudonym, both before and after her marriage in 1888 to Herbert Dickinson Ward, a journalist seventeen years younger. She also used the pseudonym Mary Adams. She gained recognition early in life from prominent literary figures including Thomas Wentworth Higginson and John Greenleaf Whittier.\n\nAt age 19 she sent a Civil War story titled \"A Sacrifice Consumed\" to \"Harper's Magazine\". The magazine editor warmly received her contribution and sent her a generous payment along with a note asking her to write for them again. In 1864 \"Harpers\" published her first adult fiction. She then began writing her first books for children which became known as the \"Tiny series\". She followed these with the four-volume \"Gypsy Brenton\" series, which was later recognized as her best-known juvenile writing. She also published two books that depicted the realistic adventures of a four-year-old boy named Trotty, \"The Trotty Book\" (1870) and \"Trotty's Wedding Tour, and Story-book\" (1873). Her story \"The Tenth of January\" appeared in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" in March 1868. It was about the death of scores of girls in the Pemberton Mill collapse and fire in Lawrence, Massachusetts on January 10, 1860.\n\nWard wrote three Spiritualist novels. The first, \"The Gates Ajar\", became her most famous. It took her two years to write. She wrote later that after she spent more than two years revising it, \"I could have said it by heart.\" The book was finally published after the end of the Civil War. In it, she writes about a girl named Mary Cabot, whose brother was killed during the Civil War. The grief-stricken girl becomes convinced that she and her brother will be reunited in an afterlife in which people retain their physical shapes and personalities.\n\nThe book became very popular, in part from its positive portrayal of death shortly after the Civil War, during which more than 400,000 individuals lost their lives. It also received a great deal of criticism for the way Phelps depicted heaven as less a place to greet God than to be reunited with loved ones. It rejected the traditional Calvinist view of Heaven. The controversy only stimulated sales, and within a few weeks after its release, her publisher sent her a payment for $600 (about $ in today's dollars) and a note, “Your book is moving grandly. It has already reached a sale of 4,000 copies.”\n\nOver 100,000 copies were sold in the United States and England and it was translated and reprinted at least four other languages.\n\nShe received thousands of letters in response to the first book. She wrote two more books on the same topic, \"Between the Gates\" and \"Beyond the Gates\". She then wrote a novella about animal rights titled \"Loveliness\". Phelps said she wrote \"The Gates Ajar\" to comfort a generation of women who were devastated by the losses of their loved ones following the Civil War and who found no comfort in traditional religion. Phelps' vision of heaven made the book a run-away best seller. She later built on the success of the first Gates book with a series of other books that featured the word \"Gates\" in their titles and which continued to reinforce her views of the afterlife as a place with gardens, comfortable front porches, and finely built houses.\n\n\"The Gates Ajar\" inspired works by other authors in the following decades, such as Mark Twain's parody \"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\" and Louis H. Pendleton's \"Wedding Garment: A Tale of the Afterlife\". The final novel in the \"Gates\" series was also adapted into a stage play in 1901 titled \"Within the Gates\".\n\nWhile writing these and other popular stories, she became an advocate through her lectures and other work for social reform, temperance, and the women's emancipation. She was also involved in clothing reform for women, and in 1874 urged them to burn their corsets.\n\nA key influence on her writings on women's rights, especially her beliefs regarding marriage, were the works of John Stuart Mill, such as Mill's 1869 essay The Subjection of Women. Though Phelps was an avid writer on reform issues, she was not actively involved with women's rights organizations or other reform groups of the time. The progressive deterioration of her health from the 1870s onward kept her contributions mostly literary in nature rather than public.\n\nIn 1877 she published a novel, \"The Story of Avis\", that was ahead of its time. The work focuses on many of the early feminist issues of her era. In it she portrayed a woman's struggle to balance her married life and associated domestic responsibilities with her passion to become a painter. The protagonist is an independent, extraordinary woman in her time who initially decides her goals will not be constrained by marriage and financial dependence on a husband, although she eventually ends up marrying anyhow. She may have been reflecting her mother's life when she described the impossibility of pursuing both her artistic ambitions and adhering to her domestic responsibilities. Elizabeth's novel was largely influenced by Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh. Phelps's unfavorable depiction of men's and women's roles in marriage was controversial.\n\nIn 1876 Phelps became the first woman to present a lecture series at Boston University. Her presentations were titled \"Representative Modern Fiction\" and they analyzed the works of George Eliot.\n\nSocial advocacy was also incorporated in Phelp's various children's literature publications as she did not attempt to conceal the inequities of the era's class structure. In stories such as \"Bobbit's Hotel\", \"One Way to Get An Education\", and \"Mary Elizabeth\", Phelps directly illustrates the impact of poverty on children. In \"Bobbit's Hotel\", the title character dies in an effort to shelter two young orphans. \"Mary Elizabeth\" depicts a young homeless girl's choices between theft and begging as a means of survival. \"One Way to Get An Education\" depicts a child laborer's desire for a better life than mill work and subsequent decision to self-injure in order to attain an education.\n\nElizabeth Stuart Phelps and her husband co-authored two Biblical romances in 1890 and 1891. Her autobiography, \"Chapters from a Life\" was published in 1896 after being serialized in McClure's. She also wrote a large number of essays for Harper's Magazine.\n\nPhelps continued to write short stories and novels into the twentieth century. Her novel \"Trixy\" (1904) focused on antivivisection, a cause she supported later in life. Writer, feminist, and animal rights advocate Carol J. Adams describes the novel as \"important and timely.\" Her last work, \"Comrades\" (1911) was published posthumously. Phelps died January 28, 1911, in Newton Center, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was brother of Theodore Thring (1816-1891), Henry, Lord Thring, a noted jurist and Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury, hymn writer Godfrey Thring, and John Charles Thring, a master at Uppingham School and deviser of the Simplest Game rules for football; he also had two sisters. The family is commemorated in the Church of All Saints, Alford by carved choir seats in the chancel and two memorial windows.\n\nThring was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Fellowship in 1844. He was ordained in the Church of England in 1846 and served in various curacies until in 1853 he began his true life work by an appointment to the headmastership of Uppingham School.\n\nThring is Uppingham's best-known headmaster, remaining in the post until 1887. He raised the school to a high state of efficiency, and stamped it with the qualities of his own strong personality, as did Thomas Arnold at Rugby. He made many innovative changes to the school's curriculum which were later adopted in other English schools. During his headship the school was forced to move temporarily to Borth in Wales after an outbreak of typhoid ravaged the student body.\n\nIn 1869, Edward Thring formed the Headmasters' Conference after inviting thirty-seven of his fellow headmasters to meet at his house to consider establishing such an annual meeting.\n\nHe was an original thinker and writer on education and various educational works.\n\nThring was the headmaster of Uppingham between 1853 and 1887; here he turned a poor provincial grammar school of 25 boys into a top public school within ten years. Thring insisted on confining the school to around 300 boys to maintain a small, \"tight-knit\" Christian community. Thring believed that every boy was good for something. His early experience teaching Gloucester National elementary schools had convinced him that \"to teach the slow and ignorant with success is the only test of proficiency and intellectual power.\" In addition to being a believer in teaching the classics, Thring broadened the overall curriculum at Uppingham by ensuring that the moral, aesthetic, and physical aspects meet the needs of the students. Although Uppingham was a huge achievement in itself, Thring's achievements extended beyond Uppingham as he was co-founder of the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) and he produced his \"Theory and Practice of Teaching\".\n\n\n"}

In 2013, Malaysiakini's parent company launched two sites - business portal KiniBiz and internet TV news site KiniTV.\n\nUnlike most news sources in Malaysia, Malaysiakini remains free from government regulation. Its political stand is disputed, as it claims to be pro government but the public and mainstream media have acknowledged it as being pro-opposition.\n\n\"Malaysiakini\" was founded by Premesh Chandran and Steven Gan in November 1999. Frustrated with constraints on his previous reporting for \"The Sun\", Gan decided to use the Multimedia Super Corridor pledge to create a space for uncensored journalism. The site began with a staff of five journalists and a starting budget of $100,000. Gan served as its editor-in-chief. For its first story, \"Malaysiakini\" posted a report on 20 November criticising the practices of \"Sin Chew Daily\", Malaysia's largest-circulation Chinese-language newspaper. \"Sin Chew Daily\" had doctored a photograph of Malaysia's ruling party to remove Anwar Ibrahim, who had recently been imprisoned for corruption. According to BBC News, the \"Malaysiakini\" report led to \"worldwide infamy\" for \"Sin Chew Daily\", and the newspaper later issued a public apology. In April 2001, \"Malaysiakini\" made news again when it discovered and reported the secret detention of 10 political activists.\n\nThe Malaysiakini website is updated daily, except for certain public holidays. Its news coverage concentrates mainly on local events, with a strong emphasis on items related to Malaysian politics. Malaysiakini also publishes columns, blogs and features that offer diverse viewpoints, both on local and international issues. Malaysiakini claims to practice an editorial policy that is consistently supportive of justice, human rights, democracy, freedom of speech and good governance.\n\nMalaysiakini publishes its readers' opinions in its letters section. The letters section has generated active participation from readers of all races and religions and of various ideological backgrounds, creating an open arena of public debate unseen in Malaysia since the 1960s. Among other common topics are taboo subjects such as migrant workers, AIDS, Islam and racial quota systems. Malaysiakini claims to avoid exercising excessive editorial control on the letters section, as it attempts to foster a spirit of reasoned discussion.\n\nIn September 2012, Malaysiakini was admitted to receiving grants from National Endowment for Democracy and other organisations. Premesh Chandran, the CEO of Malaysiakini said that Malaysiakini is \"transparent about such partnerships\". The foreign grants \"form a small part of Malaysiakini's budget\". He also said that Malaysiakini is 70% owned by its co-founders and staff. He claimed that despite receiving grants from international donors, the editorial independence was not compromised. He said about the matter in a statement in response to media reports following controversy over funding provided by National Endowment for Democracy to human rights group such as SUARAM and a host of other organisations, including Malaysiakini.\n\nMalaysiakini's former editor YL Chong claimed that George Soros indirectly funded the online news portal and that the online news portal refused to allow this fact to be known and that the former editor resigned in protest. Malaysiankini, of course, refuted these allegations.\nMalaysiakini applied in 2010 for a license to circulate the newspaper in print, which was rejected by the Home Ministry. It successfully appealed in the High Court and the High Court judged that Malaysiakini was to be issued a publication permit. The Home Ministry appealed the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. The appeal was dismissed. Legally victorious, the newspaper requested the Home Ministry again for a permit. However, the application was rejected again.\n\nIn 2001, \"Malaysiakini\" won a Free Media Pioneer award from the International Press Institute.\n\nGan himself won a 2000 International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\". In July 2001, \"Businessweek\" named him one of the \"Stars of Asia\" in the category \"Opinion Shapers\" for his work with the website.\n\nIn 2014, it received Social Media Award during Worldwide Bloggers and Social Media Award 2014 in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMalaysiakini has attracted its fair share of controversy. In March 2001, police in the Malaysian state of Selangor lodged a report against the website for quoting comments questioning the official death toll from racial rioting in the city of Petaling Jaya. In July of the same year, a university student leader filed a report claiming that a letter published on Malaysiakini bearing his name was not written by him.\n\nHowever, the most serious incident occurred on 20 January 2003 when Malaysiakini was raided by the Malaysian police. Four servers and 15 personal computers from its office worth RM150,000 (US$39,500) were seized during the raid. The police raid was instigated after the right-wing cadres in UMNO Youth, an arm of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), complained that a letter written by \"Petrof\", a reader, and published on Malaysiakini's website was seditious. In its police report, UMNO Youth claimed that the letter had questioned the special rights and privileges of the Bumiputras that are enshrined in the Constitution. Additionally, UMNO Youth claimed that the letter also contained false allegations that the Malaysian government was unfair to other ethnic races in the country. The seizure of the hardware temporarily silenced Malaysiakini, though it eventually resumed its normal operations.\n\nOn 1 April 2005, Malaysiakini published a fake news report alleging that four unnamed senior government officials were being charged for corruption. The report turned out to be an April Fool's joke, albeit published with the intention of casting the spotlight on official corruption, a problem still rife in Malaysia. These caused quite a stir in Malaysia with the government ordering a probe on the news organisation.\n\nIn May 2007, the news portal was sued for defamation by then Chief Minister of Sarawak, Abdul Taib Mahmud in the Kuala Lumpur High Court, an apology, unspecified amount of damages and injunction against Malaysiakini and Gan, for 12 articles between 6 April and 3 May that year. The suit was retracted in January 2012 after the news portal made an apology in public court for publishing unverified news.\n\nOn 10 April 2015, the news portal published an article in which it claimed that Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) president, Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang supported Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). PAS President Office refuted these allegations a day later as \"misleading\".\n\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings ninth overall in the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Oklahoma State.\n\nWilliams attended Oklahoma State University, where he was a mainstay on the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team's defensive front, starting 42 games during his career. He recorded 160 tackles, 38 tackles for loss, and 18.5 sacks during his career and was an integral part of a team that improved from 3-8 with 1 win in the conference in 2000 to an 8-5 overall record with a 5-3 conference mark in 2002. The Cowboys' Houston Bowl appearance in 2002 was only the second time in 14 years that OSU made it to a bowl game.\n\nAfter an outstanding performance during the Senior Bowl, Williams went from a marginal first round choice to a possible top 12 pick for the 2003 NFL Draft in most scouts' estimation. However, he was considered a “classic one-year wonder” and compared to Gerard Warren by Stewart Mandel of \"Sports Illustrated\". Others considered Williams \"a more natural end\" and suggested a move to the edge in the NFL. The Vikings were actually slotted as the 7th team for the 1st round of the draft, but when their 15 minutes on the clock expired, two other teams rushed in and made selections (Jacksonville took Byron Leftwich and Carolina selected Jordan Gross) before Minnesota finally got to choose Williams.\n\nIn 2003, Williams was one of the top impact rookie defenders in team history and led the Vikings with 10.5 sacks, the 2nd-most sacks by a Vikings rookie behind Keith Millard's 11.0 in 1985. He was a consensus All-Rookie team honoree having started opening 12 games of the season at left defensive end and moved inside to start at nose tackle for the final 4 games. He set the Vikings rookie record with 3.0 sacks in season finale at Arizona on December 28. Williams was named NFC Defensive Rookie of the Month when he had 18 tackles, 5.0 sacks, a forced fumble and an interception in the 4-game stretch and joined Carl Eller (1964) and Al Noga (1988) as the only rookie defensive ends in team history to start the season opener when he debuted in the lineup at Green Bay September 7 and also joined defensive end Lance Johnstone as players with 10.0+ sacks, the first time in Vikings history since 1993 when Chris Doleman and John Randle accomplished the feat.\n\nWilliams compiled 11.5 sacks in 2004, 4 in 2005, and 5 in 2006. Williams played under tackle in the Minnesota Vikings 4-3 defense, with teammate Pat Williams manning the nose tackle position. They were known collectively as the \"Williams Wall\" as well as the \"Williams Wrecking Crew\" due to their physical presence at the line of scrimmage, an attribute that helped them lead the Vikings to the best rushing defense in the league for three consecutive seasons (2006–08).\n\nOn December 23, 2006, the Minnesota Vikings signed him to a new 7-year contract extension that could reach $50 million with incentives, the contract also included $16 million in guaranteed money.\n\nIn 2007, during the NFL Kickoff game, Williams intercepted Atlanta Falcons quarterback Joey Harrington and ran 54 yards for a touchdown in the 1st quarter. This was the Vikings' first TD for the 2007 season. In week 14 of the same season, Williams intercepted San Francisco 49ers quarterback Trent Dilfer and returned the pick for a touchdown in the 1st quarter. It was the first touchdown of the game and William's second interception touchdown of the season.\n\nOn December 2, 2008, he received a four-game suspension for use of a diuretic, which can be used a masking agent for steroid use. It is believed that the diuretic was found in a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking. Williams, along with Pat Williams, appealed the suspension to a Minnesota federal court; the judge ruled against the NFL's decision and allowed all suspended players, including Williams, to play until a further review of the case. The case review had been ongoing through the entire 2009 and 2010 NFL seasons, but in 2011, he was suspended for only 2 games under the rules of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nOn June 12, 2014, Williams signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks in excess of $2 million. He would play all 16 games for the Seahawks that season, recording 30 tackles, 3 sacks, 2 pass deflections, and 6 tackles for loss on the #1 defense in points allowed in the league. Williams played in his first career Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLIX. In the Super Bowl, Williams recorded 3 tackles, but the Seahawks lost 28–24 to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints signed Williams to a one-year contract on June 12, 2015. He blocked an extra point during the Saints Week 12 matchup against the Carolina Panthers. Stephone Anthony picked it up and returned it for two points, becoming the first person to do so.\n\nOn July 27, 2016, Williams signed a one-day contract with the Minnesota Vikings before announcing his retirement from professional football.\n\nWilliams graduated from Fordyce High School in 1998, where many of his individual football records still stand. Williams married in June 2005 to Tasha, who ended her collegiate basketball career in 2006 as a senior at Louisiana Tech and helped the Lady Techsters to the NCAA Tournament, earning all-conference honors. Kevin majored in general studies and earned his degree in the spring of 2003 from Oklahoma State.\n\n"}

He quickly became interested in politics and diplomacy.\n\nHe was ambassador to the Netherlands and Spain, and distinguished himself by his opposition to Guizot. Drouyn de Lhuys served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1848 to 1849 in the first government of Odilon Barrot.

He returned briefly as foreign minister for a few days in January 1851, and then returned permanently in the summer of 1852, becoming the first foreign minister of the Second Empire. He resigned his post in 1855, during the Crimean War, when the peace preliminaries he had agreed to in consultation with the British and Austrians at Vienna were rejected by Napoleon III.\n\nDrouyn de Lhuys returned to power 7 years later, in 1862, when foreign minister Édouard Thouvenel resigned over differences with Napoleon on Italian affairs. Drouyn was thus foreign minister in the lead-up to the Austro-Prussian War. He commented that, \"the Emperor has immense desires and limited abilities.

{"id": "1795997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795997", "title": "Ecce homo", "text": "Ecce homo\n\nEcce homo (, , ; \"behold the man\") are the Latin words used by Pontius Pilate in the Vulgate translation of the Gospel of John, when he presents a scourged Jesus Christ, bound and crowned with thorns, to a hostile crowd shortly before his Crucifixion. The original , is rendered by most English Bible translations, e.g. Douay-Rheims Bible and King James Version, as \"behold the man\". The scene has been widely depicted in Christian art.\n\nA scene of the \"Ecce Homo\" is a standard component of cycles illustrating the Passion and Life of Christ in art. It follows the Flagellation of Christ, the Crowning with thorns and the Mocking of Christ, the last two often being combined: The usual depiction shows Pilate and Christ, the mocking crowd and parts of the city of Jerusalem.\n\nBut, from the 15th century, devotional pictures began to portray Jesus alone, in half or full figure with a purple robe, loincloth, crown of thorns and torture wounds, especially on his head. Similar subjects but with the wounds of the crucifixion visible (Nail wounds on the limbs, spear wounds on the sides), are termed a Man of Sorrow(s) (also Misericordia). If the instruments of the Passion are present, it may be called an Arma Christi. If Christ is sitting down (usually supporting himself with his hand on his thigh), it may be referred to it as \"Christ at rest\" or Pensive Christ. It is not always possible to distinguish these subjects.\n\nThe first depictions of the \"ecce homo\" scene in the arts appear in the 9th and 10th centuries in the Syrian-Byzantine culture of the Antiochian Greek Christians.\n\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy this type of icon is generally known by a different title: ″ ″ (). It is derived from the words in , by which Jesus Christ reveals himself, in his Parable of the Ten Virgins according to the Gospel of Matthew, as the bearer of the most high joy.\n\nThe icon presents the bridegroom as a suffering Christ, mocked and humiliated by Pontius Pilate's soldiers before his crucifixion.\n\nThe daily Midnight Office summons the faithful to be ready at all times for the day of the Dread Judgement, which will come unexpectedly like \"a bridegroom in the night\". On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the first three days of Passion Week, the last week before Pascha, consecrated to the commemoration of the last days of the earthly life of the Saviour, is chanted the troparion \"\"Behold the Bridegroom Cometh at Midnight\"\" ().\n\nA Passion Play, presented in Moscow (27 March 2007) and in Rome (29 March 2007), recalls the words, with which \"in Holy Scriptures Christ describes Himself as a bridegroom\":\n\nDepictions of Western Christianity in the Middle Ages, e.g. the \"Egbert Codex\" and the \"Codex Aureus Epternacensis\", seem to depict the \"ecce homo\" scene (and are usually interpreted as such), but more often than not only show the Crowning of thorns and the Mocking of Christ, which precede the actual \"ecce homo\" scene in the Bible. The independent image only developed around 1400, probably in Burgundy, but then rapidly became extremely popular, especially in Northern Europe.\nThe motif found increasing currency as the Passion became a central theme in Western piety in the 15th and 16th centuries. The \"ecce homo\" theme was included not only in the passion plays of medieval theatre, but also in cycles of illustrations of the story of the Passion, as in the ' of Albrecht Dürer or the ' of Martin Schongauer. The scene was (especially in France) often depicted as a sculpture or group of sculptures; even altarpieces and other paintings with the motif were produced (e.g. by Hieronymus Bosch or Hans Holbein). Like the passion plays, the visual depictions of the \"ecce homo\" scene, it has been argued, often, and increasingly, portray the people of Jerusalem in a highly critical light, bordering perhaps on antisemitic caricatures. Equally, this style of art has been read as a kind of simplistic externalisation of the inner hatred of the angry crowd towards Jesus, not necessarily implying any racial judgment.\n\nThe motif of the lone figure of a suffering Christ who seems to be staring directly at the observer, enabling him/her to personally identify with the events of the Passion, arose in the late Middle Ages. At the same time similar motifs of the \"Man of Sorrow\" and \"Christ at rest\" increased in importance. The subject was used repeatedly in later so-called old master prints (e.g. by Jacques Callot and Rembrandt), in the paintings of the Renaissance and the Baroque, as well as in Baroque sculptures.\n\nHieronymus Bosch painted his first Ecce Homo during the 1470s. He returned to the subject in 1490 to paint in a characteristically Netherlandish style, with deep perspective and a surreal ghostly image of praying monks in the lower left-hand corner.\n\nIn 1498, Albrecht Dürer depicted the suffering of Christ in the \"Ecce Homo\" of his \"\" in unusually close relation with his self-portrait, leading to a reinterpretation of the motif as a metaphor for the suffering of the artist. James Ensor used the \"ecce homo\" motif in his ironic painting \"Christ and the Critics\" (1891), in which he portrayed himself as Christ.\n\nAntonio Ciseri's 1871 \"Ecce Homo\" portrayal presents a semi-photographic view of a balcony seen from behind the central figures of a scourged Christ and Pilate (whose face is not visible). The crowd forms a distant mass, almost without individuality, and much of the detailed focus is on the normally secondary figures of Pilate's aides, guards, secretary and wife.\nOne of the more famous modern versions of the Ecce Homo motif was that by the Polish artist Adam Chmielowski, who went on to found, as Brother Albert, the Albertine Brothers () and, a year later, the Albertine Sisters (), eventually becoming proclaimed a saint on 12 November 1989 by Pope John Paul II, the author of \"\", a play about Chmielowski, written between 1944–1950, when the future Pontiff and later himself a saint was a young priest. (146 cm x 96.5 cm, unsigned, painted between 1879 and 1881), was significant in Chmielowski's life, as it is in \"Act 1\" of Wojtyła's play. Pope John Paul II is said to have kept a copy of this painting in his apartment at the Vatican. The original can be viewed in the Ecce Homo Sanctuary of the Albertine Sisters in Kraków. It was painted at a time when the painter was going through an inner struggle, trying to decide whether to remain an artist, or to give up painting to pursue the calling to minister to the poor.\n\nEspecially in the 19th and 20th centuries, the meaning of \"ecce homo\" motif has been extended to the portrayal of suffering and the degradation of humans through violence and war. Notable 20th-century depictions are George Grosz's (1922–1923) and Lovis Corinth's \"Ecce Homo\" (1925). The 84 drawings and 16 watercolors of Grosz criticize the socio-political conditions of the Weimar Republic. Corinth shows, from the perspective of the crowd, Jesus, a soldier, and Pilate dressed as a physician. Following the Holocaust of World War II, Otto Dix portrayed himself, in \"Ecce Homo with self-likeness behind barbed wire\" (1948), as the suffering Christ in a concentration camp.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1796009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796009", "title": "Marie of Hesse-Kassel", "text": "Marie of Hesse-Kassel\n\nMarie Sophie Frederikke of Hesse-Kassel (28 October 1767 – 21/22 March 1852) was queen consort of Denmark and Norway by marriage to Frederick VI. She served as regent of Denmark during the absence of her spouse in 1814–1815.\n\nMarie was the eldest child of Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Louise of Denmark. Her father was the second son of the ruler of Hesse-Kassel, and as such, had no principality of his own. Thus he acted in such positions as were offered to cadet members of royal houses by their reigning relatives. Denmark offered more and better positions than the small Hesse-Kassel.\nHer mother was the third and youngest daughter of King Frederick V of Denmark and his consort, Louise of Great Britain. As such, she was the niece of King Christian VII and the Prince Regent Frederick, as well as their first cousin. \n\nShe was born in Hanau, but was raised in Slesvig in Denmark from 1769, when her father was appointed governor of the Danish duchies. Marie spent her early life in Gottorp Castle and at her mother's Danish country estate Louisenlund. Little is known of Marie's childhood, but the life of the little German court at Louisenlund, headed by Fraulein von Berlichingen, are described by her mother's lady-in-waiting Julie Stolberg as very simple, without great ceremony, and that the royal couple allowed their children to be raised very naturally. She was given a German education, and German was her first language. She was affected by her father's interest in mysticism, and was also fascinated by dreams. \nMarie was later to describe her childhood as happy, and often expressed that she missed the idyll of her childhood home and longed to visit it. \n\nAfter crown prince Frederick was declared of legal majority and resumed the regency in 1784, the Danish royal court started to make inquiries to arrange a marriage for him. Marie was among the candidates for the marriage, and described as literary interested, and reported to have composed poetry and have made a declamation of the Messiah. However, she was not the preferred candidate within the royal court, and it was pointed out both that Frederick did not share Marie's literary interests, and that she was further more given a much too free and unrestricted childhood. The influential sister of Frederick, Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark, reportedly feared that she would be replaced in her brothers affections, and her husband, the Duke of Augustenburg, likewise feared to have his influence diminished, and they were supported by a party at court which was opposed to Marie's father Prince Charles, who was widely unpopular. Frederick arranged his marriage against the will of both his court, council and also of his sister and brother-in-law, but he had the support of his future father-in-law, who attempted to gain influence in Danish state affairs through it. \n\nCrown Prince Regent Frederick strongly disliked being affected in his choice by the court, and was eager to show himself independent to it. Marie was selected by her cousin as his spouse mainly as a way for him to demonstrate his independence from his court, who wanted a more political dynastic match. In the summer of 1787, Frederick made a visit to Prince Charles and his aunt Princess Louise at Gottorp Castle and met Marie as well. On 31 July 1790 in Gottorp, she married her first cousin Frederick, then crown prince and regent of Denmark.\n\nThe marriage was greeted with great enthusiasm by the public, as she was regarded as completely Danish and not a foreigner, and she was referred to as a daughter of the nation. Her official entrance into Copenhagen on 14 September 1790 was described as a triumph. The occasion was used by writers and the press to celebrate not only Marie, but also Frederick's enlightened rule and popularity, for which his marriage was taken as another proof because of Marie's status as a Dane. A known poem, Heibergs Indtogsvise, praised the marriage because \"Frederick had chosen his bride among the daughters of the nation\". \n\nCrown Princess Marie was described as shy and reserved, particularly as she did not master the Danish language, and her shyness was interpreted as haughtiness, while her sister-in-law Louise Augusta continued to be the center of the royal court and the most popular female member of the royal family. This was illustrated by an incident at the Royal Danish Theatre in 1792, when Republican sentiments grew in Copenhagen during the victories of the revolutionary French army under Dumouriez, the crown princess, who entered her box with a deeper nod as greeting to the public than usual, was met by the comment \"Look at that, if Dumoriez has not taught the princess to be civil!\", while her sister-in-law was greeted by the public with the shouts \"Welcome, Darling Augusta!\" Within the circles of the royal court and nobility, Marie was viewed as a threat to the popular Louise Augusta, and was compared unfavorably with her. She was criticized at court for being too proud, of driving a wedge between the crown prince at the Augustenburg party, and of not being accommodating enough toward her sister-in-law. Marie, however, is known to have been eager to come to terms with her sister-in-law, and at least on one known occasion to have asked her to forgive her if she had caused her any offence. Her father introduced her and the crown prince to circles invested in German religious mysticism, and the princely couple, Prince Charles, Andreas Peter Bernstorff and Augusta Bernstorff, are known to have invited Lavater to Denmark in 1793. Lavater did visit them in the summer of 1793, and has described Marie as a lovable young child. \n\nCrown Princess Marie was put under immense pressure to produce a male heir to the throne, as the main line of the royal family was in danger of being extinguished. She gave birth to son who died in 1791, and lost several children in the following years, with only two daughters alive, who were not considered suitable heirs to the throne because of their gender. She accepted the death of her children with the words \"God's will be done\" and expressed herself happy with the children who did live, and her humble and brave attitude during her childbirths was admired and contributed to defeat the hostility at court voiced by the \nReventlow-Bernstorft-Schimmelmann-Party, and replaced it with admiration. \n\nAs for the relationship with Frederick, Marie described herself privately to the wife of Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow as \"the happiest of wives\". During the fire of Christiansborg Palace in 1794, Andreas Peter Bernstorff described Marie in a letter: \n\nMarie eventually became popular within the small circle of people who came to know her, but her reserved nature did not make her popular among the wider court or public and she was disliked for not being seen very often in public by the side of the crown prince when she might have been expected to be, as she abhorred representational duties. \n\nIn 1805, the crown prince couple moved to Kiel to be close to the border during because of the threatening proximity of Napoleon in Germany, and Marie was to remain there until 1809. She enjoyed the years in Kiel very much: court life and representation was reduced, she was able to visit her parents in Gottorp and Louisenlund, and she referred to the years in Kiel as a paradise. In 1808, the burghers of Kiel built a pavilion and presented it to Marie as a gift.\n\nIn 1808, Frederick became king, and Marie queen. On 31 October 1809, she made her second official entry to Copenhagen, this time as queen, an occasion which has been described as a moment when her personal popularity among the public was demonstrated. \n\nDuring her husband's last years as crown prince, he often spent long periods in Copenhagen while she remained in Kiel, and these years created a distance between them. When her last childbirth in 1808 resulted in an injury which prevented further intercourse, she was forced to accept her spouse's adultery with Frederikke Dannemand. The relationship between Marie and Frederick VI after this was described as a respectful friendship, and the political turmoil of the time reportedly created a trusting relationship between them. The writer Ingemann wrote of her: \"She wore the crown with dignity and with a bleeding heart.\" \n\nMarie was interested in politics, genealogy and history. She had started to take an interest in politics during her years in Kiel. She was more often noted to speak of politics with people to acquire knowledge, was courted by the Reventlow-Stolberg Party, and was opposed to Napoleon and the alliance with France. She inspired Frederick VI to take the later Christian IX of Denmark into his family in 1825, and he arrived in Denmark in 1832. \nMarie also took an interest in history and literature. She became more acquainted with Danes, finally learned the Danish language more fluently, took an interest in Danish literature and was known to read aloud the works of Oehlenschlager and Ingemann. Her lady-in-wating Amalie Münster, who was a literary person, attracted many artists to the circle of the queen. \n\nIn 1822–24, Marie anonymously published the genealogy \"Supplement-Tafeln zu Joh. Hubners genealogischen Tabellen\", a genealogy with historical notes. Reportedly, she kept a diary since her wedding and wrote her memoirs with support of it, but as she had ordered it burnt in her will, it is no longer kept. From 1815, she protected the women's charity organisation \"Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab\". \n\nAs queen she is described as serene, peaceful and dignified. Elise Bernstorff, married to minister Christian August Bernstorff described Marie in 1810: \nShe was nevertheless known to be strict in regards to etiquette and protocol. Among her closest friends were the courtier Rantzau Breitenburg, who commented about their friendship, that she viewed him as her confessor. Rantzau Breitenburg described the queen as terrified of making the king or the public displeased with her, and therefore very anxious and hesitant to take initiatives. \n\nQueen Marie was regent of Denmark from 5 September 1814 to 1 June 1815, during the absence of her spouse in the Vienna Congress in Austria. Marie took her office as regent with ambition, and she was regarded to have performed her duties well during her regency. When she took her seat on her first day in the regency, she read aloud her own \"Exposé de la situation politique du Danemarc\" as her opening speech, a summary of the Danish foreign policy since 1807, which had placed Denmark, as an ally of Napoleon, in the difficult situation it was in 1814, and an analysis of the political condition of Denmark. \n\nBy doing so she voiced concerns widely felt in Denmark at the time, where there was great discontent with the king's policy during the Napoleonic wars, and she was therefore greeted with great enthusiasm during her regency. In October 1814, a foreign spectator noted, \"This Princess was greeted at the theater yesterday with great cheers\", and the following year, \"The queen was greeted with unanimous cheers at the theatre. How times changes! There was a time when one referred to her as 'German Maria', but now its different\". She excused Frederick VI in regard to the Norwegian question, and strongly criticized the behavior of Prince Christian, though she did send him a ship to evacuate him from Norway and bring him back to Denmark.\n\nFrom the end of her regency in 1815 until the death of Frederick VI in 1839, her life as queen was a quiet one and she participated in social life only when necessary to fulfill her representational duties. One of the reasons for her reclusive lifestyle was reportedly the injury from her last childbirth, which evidently made it necessary for her to move about more carefully. \n\nDuring the reign of Frederick, particularly after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the royal family became a popular symbol of family life, as the king appeared to the public in the capital walking in the park with his wife and daughters, and sailing with them along the canal.\n\nMarie was widowed in 1839. As a widow, she retired from public life to a peaceful existence divided by Fredericksburg and Amalienborg, respected as a symbol of the former dynasty line. \n\nReportedly, she was a stranger to politics during her later life, but the strife between the branches of the family during the succession crisis and the rebellion in Holstein pained her. Marie could not understand the split caused by the emerging nationalism, nor the political conflicts caused by the demands of an emerging democracy, and was confused about the new ideas of the time. \nAnders Sandøe Ørsted wrote: \nBishop Martensen noted her sorrow over the war with Schleswig-Holstein and that she did not understand the new ideas of a nation, and that she once said: \n\nMarie died at Amalienborg in 21 March 1852.\n\nMarie and Frederick VI had eight children. None of Frederick VI's sons survived infancy, however, and when he died in 1839, he was succeeded by his cousin, Christian VIII of Denmark. The only surviving children of King Frederick VI and Queen Marie were their two daughters:\n\n\nQueen Marie lamented her lack of sons and grandchildren. When her youngest sister, Duchess Louise Caroline of Lyksborg, became a widow when most of her large brood of children were as yet very young, Queen Marie accepted some of the younger ones into her tutelage in the royal household. They were much younger than the queen's two surviving daughters. One such foster child of hers was the future Christian IX of Denmark, born in 1818.\n\nChristian of Lyksborg and his wife Louise of Hesse-Kassel named their second daughter, Marie Sophie Frederikke Dagmar of Lyksborg (born 1847), in the queen's honor as her namesake. After her death in 1852, that girl became Tsarina Maria Fedorovna of Russia, preserving there the queen's first name (Maria/Marie).\n\nShe became the 292nd Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa on 17 April 1834.\n\n\n|-\n"}

AIMS was a standards-based assessment aligned with the Arizona Academic Content Standards. In November 2014, the Arizona State Board of Education voted to replace AIMS with a new test called AzMERIT. (Arizona's Measurement of Educational Readiness to Inform Teaching)\n\nThe content of AIMS varied by grade level, but it usually featured three reading and mathematics sections, as well as a writing portion, where students were assigned to write an essay based on a prompt given to them. For some grade levels, the test included a science portion in lieu of a writing section.\n\nTo graduate from an Arizona public high school, a student had to meet the AIMS High School Graduation Requirement. The most common way to meet this requirement was to pass the writing, reading, and mathematics content areas of the AIMS HS test. High school students had multiple opportunities to take and pass these content areas. For students who did not pass all three required content areas of the AIMS HS test, there were alternative methods for meeting the AIMS High School Graduation requirement. This requirement was dropped after the test was replaced by the AzMERIT test.\n\nAdditionally, starting with the class of 2006, high-school students in Arizona who exceeded all three standards in reading, writing, and math may have been eligible for a scholarship to any of the three public state universities if they also met certain other criteria. Students must have completed all 16 core competency courses (4 units English, 4 units Math, 3 units Lab Science, 2 units Social Science, 2 units Foreign Language, and 1 unit Fine Arts) by graduation with a B or better in each course. Students must have also met at least one of the following academic requirements: A cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher on an unweighted 4.0 scale, or rank in the top 5% of their graduating class.\n\nIf a student did not exceed standards on all three tests, they may have still qualified for a scholarship if they exceeded standards on two of the AIMS sections and met standards on the other section. Additionally, they would have either needed to receive at least a score of 3 on two Advanced Placement tests or at least a score of 4 on two International Baccalaureate exams.\n\nQualified students would receive a full state university tuition waiver valid for one year following graduation from high school. The scholarship was renewable for four years based upon university-determined criteria. The actual dollar amount of the scholarship varied based upon the tuition charged by the state university in which they enrolled.\n\nOn September 23, 2010, the Arizona Board of Regents voted 9-1 to cut AIMS scholarships to just 25% of freshman year tuition, stating that the scholarship was too easy to earn. Students also hade to have an ACT score of at least 28 or an SAT-1 score of at least 1300 (i.e. the reading and mathematics scores must have been at least 1300). The changes in AIMS scholarships applied beginning with the graduating class of 2013.\n\nIn 2007, the AIMS Test began to report out Lexile measures for students in grades 3-8 and 10. A Lexile measure can be used to match readers with targeted text and monitor growth in reading ability.\n\n"}

Born in Crewe, Cheshire, Stafford became a locomotive boilermaker employed by the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) at the expansive Crewe Works.\n\nAfter some impressive displays for the Crewe Alexandra Hornets team, Stafford made his first-team debut on 22 September 1890, in a Football Alliance game against Birmingham St George's at Nantwich Road. He would go on to make over 150 appearances for the Railwaymen and become captain of the Cheshire county team. As a Crewe Alexandra player he won Cheshire Senior Cup winners medals in 1891-92 and 1892-93.\n\nBeside his football career, Stafford was a capable athlete who ran various distances from the 100 yards to the half-mile. He was also an exceptional hurdler and represented the Crewe Alexandra Athletic Club for several years until turning professional with Newton Heath disqualified him from competing in amateur athletics.\n\nStafford made his Heathens league debut in a 4–0 home win over Darwen on 3 April 1896 and immediately became the club's first-choice right-back. The following year he turned professional and was named club captain after Caesar Jenkyns was sold to Walsall. In 1900 he left the LNWR to become landlord of the Bridge House Inn, in Wrexham, North Wales.\n\nIn 1901 The Heathens were struggling financially and at the end of February held a four-day fundraising bazaar at the St James's Hall on Manchester's Oxford Street. After the show ended Stafford's dog, a St. Bernard he called The Major, went missing and by way of a restaurant manager named John Robert Thomas, came into the possession of the wealthy brewery owner John Henry Davies. Stafford was reunited with Major through a Lost & Found advert in the \"Manchester Evening News\" and refused a generous offer from Davies to buy the dog for his daughter. Despite this, J.H. Davies realised that the Newton Heath skipper was a popular character in North Manchester and in July 1901 Stafford became landlord of one of Davies's establishments, the Bridge Inn, in Ancoats.\n\nOn 6 March 1901 Newton Heath played New Brighton at Bank Street in Harry Stafford's five-year benefit match. The match was an evening kick-off and, fifty years before floodlights, was to be illuminated by Wells Lights, contraptions that generated gas from tar-oil. The ball had been gilded to make it more visible but unfortunately it was a particularly wet and windy night and the lights kept blowing out. As fast as they were re-lit others were extinguished and the match was abandoned after fifteen minutes.\n\nIn January 1902, Newton Heath were served with a winding up order with debts in excess of £2,600 and despite the best efforts of Stafford, his team-mates and supporters, the club seemed doomed. The Heathens captain arranged a meeting with J.H. Davies and using Major as bait, got him involved with the club. In March 1902 Stafford took to the stage at the New Islington Hall during a supporters meeting and announced that himself and five local businessmen would each pledge £200 to save the club. A new committee was formed with J.H. Davies as president and his daughter Elsie was gifted a St Bernard dog for her twelfth birthday.\n\nOn 26 April 1902 Stafford captained Newton Heath in their last ever game, a 2-1 win in the Manchester Senior Cup final against Manchester City at Hyde Road. It was his only winners medal in his time at Bank Street. On the same day the club announced the change of name to Manchester United Football Club.\n\nHarry Stafford and secretary James West were put in charge of football affairs making Stafford in effect club captain/manager/director. This meant that as a board member he would have no option but to revert to amateur status.\n\nOn 7 February 1903 Stafford became the first Manchester United player to be sent off, in an FA Cup tie against Liverpool at Bank Street. The following month he made his final first-team appearance for Manchester United in a home game versus Lincoln City.\n\nIn December 1904 Harry Stafford and James West were each suspended by the FA for two and a half years, after pleading guilty to making illegal payments to players and failing to keep the club's books in order. Stafford resigned his seat on the board and became landlord of the Imperial Hotel on Manchester's Piccadilly approach; a public house that in December 1907 hosted the birth of the footballers union the AFPU, the forerunner of today's PFA. After his ban he continued to act as a scout for the club and is recognised as the club's first 'fixer'.\n\nAfter United's FA Cup win in 1909, Stafford left Manchester and MUFC minutes for 19 September 1911 state that he was awarded £50 by the club to assist with his emigration to Australia. The following month he sailed for Boston, Massachusetts on the SS \"Devonian\"\",\" before travelling to Schenectady in NY State, where he began work as a boilermaker at the American Locomotive Company.\n\nIn 1917 Stafford moved to Quebec after obtaining the position of boiler inspector at the Montreal Locomotive Works but during the Great Depression lost his job and struggled financially throughout most of the 1930s. On 24 October 1940, contrary to reports that he had made a fortune as a hotelier, Harry Stafford died penniless at home on Erie Street, Montreal. His remains are interred in an unmarked grave in Mount Royal Cemetery, plot number G 733-L.\n\n\"1903 – 1904 Stafford played in one Birmingham & District League game for Crewe Alexandra v Druids of Ruabon before announcing his retirement as a player.\"\n\n\"FL2 = Football League Division 2.

Their lands were irrigated by the Ma'rib Dam, which is thought by some to have been one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world because of its size. When the dam collapsed for the third time in the 1st century CE, much of the Azd tribe left Marib and dispersed.\n\nIn the 3rd century CE the Azd branched into four sub-branches, each led by one of the sons of Amr bin Muzaikiyya.\n\nImran bin Amr and the bulk of the tribe went to Oman, where they established the Azdi presence in Eastern Arabia. Later they invaded Karaman and Shiraz in Southern Persia, and these came to be known as \"Azd Daba\". Another branch headed west back to Yemen, and a group went further west all the way to Tihamah on the Red Sea. This group was to become known as \"Azd Uman\" after the emergence of Islam.\n\nJafna bin Amr and his family headed for Syria, where he settled and initiated the kingdom of the Ghassanids. They were so named after a spring of water where they stopped on their way to Syria. This branch was to produce:\n\n\nThalabah bin Amr left his tribe Al-Azd for the Hijaz and dwelt between Thalabiyah and Dhi Qar. When he gained strength, he headed for Yathrib, where he stayed. Of his seed are the great Aws and Khazraj, sons of Haritha bin Thalabah. These were to be the Muslim Ansar and were to produce the last Arab dynasty in Spain (the Nasrids).\n\nHaritha bin Amr led a branch of the Azd Qahtani tribes. He wandered with his tribe in the Hijaz until they came to the Tihamah. He had three sons Adi, Afsa and Lahi. Adiy was the father of Bariq, Lahi the father of Khuza'a and Afsa, the father of Aslam.\n\nThe Zahran tribe is an ancient Arabian offshoot of the Azd tribe, also originating from the Kingdom of Saba'. The shortage of water prompted them to relocate to Al-Bahah in the Arabian Peninsula. Today members of the Zahran tribe can be found all over the Middle East and beyond. According to Arab scholars, the dialect used by the Hejazi tribes, the Zahran and the Ghamid, is the closest to classical Arabic.\n\nThe Azd 'Uman were the dominant Arab tribe in the eastern realms of the Caliphate and were the driving force in the conquest of Fars, Makran and Sindh. They were the chief merchant group of Oman and Al-Ubulla, who organized a trading diaspora with settlements of Persianized Arabians on the coasts of Kirman and Makran, extending into Sindh since the days of Ardashir. They were strongly involved in the western trade with India and with the expansion of the Muslim conquests they began to consolidate their commercial and political authority on the eastern frontier. During the early years of the Muslim conquests the Azdi ports of Bahrain and Oman were staging grounds for Muslim naval fleets headed to Fars and Hind. From 637 CE the conquests of Fars and Makran were dominated by the Azdi and allied tribes from Oman. Between 665 CE and 683 CE the Azdi 'Uman became especially prominent due in Basra on account of favors from Ziyad ibn Abihi, the Governor of Muawiya I, and his son Ubaidullah. When a member of their tribe Abu Said Al- Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra became governor their influence and wealth increased as he extended Muslim conquests to Makran and Sindh, where so many other Azdi were settled. After his death in 702, though, they lost their grip on power with the rise of Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf as governor of Iraq. Al-Hajjaj pursued a systematic policy of breaking Umayyad power, as a result of which the Azdi also suffered. With the death of Hajjaj and under Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik as Caliph, their fortunes reversed once again, with the appointment of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Borthwick Parish School and Dalkeith Grammar School. The family moved to Edinburgh when his father became appointed minister of Old Greyfriars Kirk.\n\nHe studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh (1733–41), and was licensed to preach in 1741. He received a Doctor of Divinity in 1759.\n\nThe educationalist and writer James Burgh, who founded a dissenting academy on the outskirts of London, was his cousin, describing him as his \"much esteemed friend and relation\".\n\nHe became minister at Gladsmuir (East Lothian) in 1743 and in 1759 at Lady Yester's Kirk and Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh. A staunch Presbyterian and Whig, he volunteered to defend the city against the Jacobites led by Prince Charles Edward Stuart in 1745.\n\nIn 1754 he was an original member of The Select Society, also referred to as the Edinburgh Select Society.\n\nRobertson became royal chaplain to George III (1761), principal of the University of Edinburgh (1762), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1763, and Historiographer Royal in 1764, reviving a role within the Royal household in Scotland that had been in abeyance from 1709 until 1763. He was also a member of The Poker Club.\n\nOne of his most notable works is his \"History of Scotland 1542–1603\", begun in 1753 and first published in 1759. Robertson also contributed, not always fortunately, to the history of Spain and Spanish America in his \"History of America\" (1777), \"the first sustained attempt to describe the discovery, conquest and settlement of Spanish America since Herrera's \"Décadas\" and his biography of Charles V. In that work he had \"provided a masterly survey of the progress of European society, in which he traced the erosion of the 'feudal system' caused by the rise of free towns, the revival of learning and Roman law, and by the emergence of royal authority and the balance of power between states. It was the development of commerce, assisted by law and private property, which was held to be chiefly responsible for the advance in civilisation.\"\n\nHe was a significant figure in the Scottish Enlightenment and also of the \"moderates\" in the Church of Scotland.\n\nIn 1783 he was a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nHe died of jaundice on 11 June 1793, at Grange House in south Edinburgh (the large, now-demolished mansion which gave its name to the Grange district).

{"id": "1796094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796094", "title": "Tishomingo State Park", "text": "Tishomingo State Park\n\nTishomingo State Park is a public recreation area located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Tishomingo County, some northeast of Tupelo, Mississippi. The major feature of the park is Bear Creek Canyon and its generous sandstone outcroppings. Activities in the park include canoeing, rock climbing, fishing, and hiking. The park sits at Milepost 304 of Natchez Trace Parkway, a scenic road operated by the National Park Service commemorating the historical Natchez Trace.\n\nThe park pays tribute to Tishomingo County's remarkable geography of massive rock formations, found here and in the immediately surrounding areas and nowhere else in Mississippi. The cliffs, valleys and abundant outcroppings of carboniferous sandstone and limestone represent the southwestern extremity of the Southern Appalachian Plateau. The boulders and towering cliffs of Hartselle Sandstone, together with the outcrops of Bangor Limestone and the creek which carves through it all, compose \"some of the most picturesque and rugged scenery in the state.\"\n\nThe park is named for one of the last great Chickasaw leaders, Chief Tishu Miko, born not far from here in Lee County, Mississippi, around 1735. Modern Chickasaw occasionally make pilgrimage to the park to visit the areas where the famous Chief fished and hunted.\n\nChief Tishomingo (the modern form of his name) served a brilliant career in the US Military, distinguishing himself in such actions as the Battle of Fallen Timbers, the Red Stick Rebellion and the War of 1812. His influence became powerful and extended into Washington, DC. He was a principal signatory to a number of important treaties, including the Treaty of Pontotoc in 1832 (negotiated at great length with Andrew Jackson but never ratified by the Senate). His most momentous and perhaps most difficult signature was put to the 1837 Treaty of Doaksville, which he affirmed only under heavy political pressure. This document, in large part a lease agreement with the Choctaw Nation, incidentally compelled the removal of the last Chickasaw from this area to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma. It is believed that, in May 1838, Chief Tishomingo succumbed to smallpox at the advanced age of 104, near Little Rock on the Trail of Tears. His burial site is unknown.\n\nThe park's importance to Native American history extends even beyond the historical Chickasaw Nation, as archaeological excavations confirm the presence of Paleo Indians in the area now encompassed by the park as early as 7000 B.C. The ancient tribes were able to produce excellent tools from the high-quality chert and limestone that was available here, and ceramic pottery from clay dug from the hills. \nThe park was among those constructed in Mississippi by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. CCC Company 3497 began work creating the park in April 1935; the park opened to the public in May 1939. Many of the original facilities are extant, including several buildings, trails, picnic tables, campgrounds, cabins and a fishing pond used by the CCC workers themselves. The rustic quality of the CCC structures resulted from the use of native materials, their original designs, and the craftsmanship of the builders. While most of the facilities in Mississippi were built of wood, Tishomingo and Wall Doxey state parks feature substantial use of stone construction.\n\nTishomingo State Park offers visitors seven hiking trails that range in length from ¾ to 3 miles and in difficulty from easy to moderate. The trails feature scenic natural springs, waterfalls, rocky creeks and streams, cliffs, rock walls and huge outcrops. The terrain suggests mountains, and indeed this is a part of the Appalachian range, but the hills here are no higher than about 660 feet. Rock climbing, which requires a helmet and a free permit (available at the park office), is a popular activity on the trails, particularly at the formation known as Jean's Overhang. Bear Creek is encountered at a number of points by the trail system, and can itself be explored by canoe on one of the float trips offered here.\n\nThree popular disc golf courses are available, and an Olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool is open during late spring and summer. The park provides a number of lodging options including 15 primitive campsites, two primitive Scout campsites, 62 developed RV campsites, which offer water and electricity, and seven furnished cabins.\n\nThe park's Nature Center, which re-opened in 2016, offers displays of Tishomingo county heritage, nature, art, animals, arrowheads and memorabilia from the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n\n"}

While he was with Manchester United he also earned a single cap for England. In 2002, Norwich fans voted Phelan into the club's Hall of Fame.\n\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Phelan moved into management. He first took a position as Gary Megson's assistant at his former club, Norwich City, before following Megson to Blackpool and then Stockport County. After Megson left Stockport, Phelan was hired by another former club, Manchester United, taking over as the assistant manager of the club's reserve team. Two years later, he was promoted to become Alex Ferguson's chief first-team coach, and in 2008 he replaced Carlos Queiroz as Ferguson's assistant manager. He remained in the position until Ferguson's retirement in 2013, when Ferguson's successor David Moyes replaced the entire coaching staff.\n\nAfter a year out of football, Phelan was appointed as first-team coach back at Norwich City in November 2014 and took temporary charge of the club when manager Neil Adams resigned in January 2015, only to be relieved of his duties by Adams' permanent replacement, Alex Neil. A month later, he was appointed as assistant manager at Hull City under former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce. He was promoted to first team management following the departure of Bruce on a temporary basis before the 2016-17 season. This was made permanent on 13 October. He was sacked from his position with Hull on 3 January 2017 with the club 20th in the Premier League.\n\nPhelan began his career at Burnley, signing as an associated schoolboy in July 1979, as an apprentice two years later and as a professional in July 1980. He made his league debut in January 1981 against Chesterfield and whilst at Turf Moor, gained England Youth caps and a Third Division champions medal in 1982. But in 1985, Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division, and Phelan moved to Norwich City for £60,000 on 13 July 1985.\n\nNorwich won the Second Division title in his first season at the club. He became club captain when Steve Bruce joined Manchester United in December 1987, captaining them to fourth place in the First Division and a place in the FA Cup semi-finals in his first full season as captain.\n\nHe was called into the England squad for the Rous Cup games against Chile and Scotland but did not play due to a hamstring injury. His success drew the attention of larger clubs and he followed Steve Bruce to Manchester United for £750,000 on 1 July 1989.\n\nAt Manchester United, he finally won his first international cap (against Italy in 1989) and an FA Cup winner's medal in his first season. This was followed by the FA Charity Shield in 1990, European Cup Winners' Cup in 1991 and the League Cup in 1992.\n\nPhelan was often deployed at right-back during his first season at Manchester United, but following the arrival of Denis Irwin in 1990 he mostly played on the right or in the centre of midfield. He had played on the right side of midfield before Irwin's arrival, most notably in the FA Cup final win over Crystal Palace in May 1990, when Paul Ince was switched from central midfield to right-back.\n\nBy 1993, however, his appearances were becoming increasingly limited due to growing competition from younger players like Andrei Kanchelskis, Paul Ince, Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe. He did make enough league appearances to collect a Premier League title medal for the 1992-93 season, but rarely played in the 1993-94 season, failing to make enough appearances for another league title medal, and not being in the squad for the FA Cup triumph over Chelsea.\n\nWith the introduction of Premier League squad numbers for the 1993–94 season, he was issued with the number 23 shirt which was next worn by Phil Neville. Phelan was given a free transfer at the end of the 1993-94 season.\n\nAfter leaving Old Trafford, Phelan signed for West Bromwich Albion, where he spent 18 months and played just 21 games, his first-team chances limited by younger players such as Kevin Donovan and Lee Ashcroft, who were more favoured by new manager Alan Buckley (appointed in the autumn following the dismissal of Keith Burkinshaw, who brought Phelan to the club).\n\nHe returned to Carrow Road in December 1995, as an assistant manager to Gary Megson (another former Norwich player) and managed the club's reserve team. When Megson was fired and joined Blackpool, Phelan followed him to take a similar role, returning to his native North-West. A year later, he followed Megson to Stockport County.\n\nFollowing Megson's sacking as Stockport County boss on 25 June 1999, Andy Kilner took over as manager. Phelan moved on shortly afterwards, taking up a role at Manchester United's Centre of Excellence. With Steve McClaren's departure to Middlesbrough in the summer of 2001, Phelan was promoted to first-team coach. He was appointed assistant manager of Manchester United on 3 September 2008, replacing Carlos Queiroz who had left to manage the Portugal national football team. For many seasons, Phelan was seen conducting interviews with BBC programmes such as \"Match of the Day\" due to United manager Alex Ferguson refusing to speak with the BBC following corruption allegations made in 2004 by the BBC's \"Panorama\" programme towards one of Ferguson's sons, football agent Jason Ferguson. Ferguson finally agreed to BBC interviews once more in August 2011.\n\nIn January 2010, Phelan was linked with a return to his first club Burnley as manager following the departure of Owen Coyle to Bolton Wanderers.\n\nHe was Sir Alex Ferguson's right-hand man during three Premier League title wins, a Club World Cup, two League Cups and two runs to the final of the UEFA Champions League. He departed the club shortly after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.\n\nOn 20 November 2014, Phelan was announced as a first-team coach at Norwich City. Following the resignation of Neil Adams on 5 January 2015, Phelan was named caretaker manager of Norwich. On 9 January 2015, Norwich appointed Hamilton Academical manager Alex Neil, and Phelan returned to his first-team coaching duties. On 20 January 2015, Phelan left the club by mutual consent.\n\nOn 5 February 2015, Phelan was named assistant manager at Hull City. On 22 July 2016, following the resignation of Steve Bruce, the club confirmed that Phelan would act as caretaker manager. He was named Premier League Manager of the Month for August, after victories over Leicester City and Swansea City, and a narrow defeat to Manchester United.\n\nOn 13 October 2016, Phelan was appointed first-team manager on a permanent basis.\n\nOn 3 January 2017, Hull City's vice-chairman Ehab Allam released a statement stating that the club and Phelan had parted company for a \"fresh approach\". the \"Daily Mail\" reported that Phelan was sacked after a row about January spending, becoming frustrated over the club's refusal to commit to investment in his playing squad. He was replaced by Marco Silva two days later.\n\nOn 16 July 2018, Phelan was appointed Sporting Director at Central Coast Mariners.\n\nOn 19 December 2018, Phelan was appointed as a first-team coach for Manchester United's caretaker manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær. On 10 May 2019 he was appointed as United's assistant manager.\n\nBurnley\n\nNorwich City\n\nManchester United\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

The city was part of the Klaipėda Region and ethnographic Lithuania Minor. Šilutė was the interwar capital of Šilutė County and is currently the capital of Šilutė District Municipality.\n\nŠilutė's origin dates to an inn (Krug, locally \"karčema\") catering to travelers and their horses which was located halfway between Memel (Klaipėda) and Tilsit (Tilžė). The German name of \"Heydekrug\" referred to a \"Krug\" (an archaic word for inn) in the \"Heide\" (heathland). The inn was known for being in the region where most people spoke the Memelland-Samogitian dialect \"Šilokarčema\".\n\nA famous fish market was opened in Šilutė almost 500 years ago, when Georg Tallat purchased the inn together with the land and fishing rights in 1511. The town was a gathering place for peasants from nearby Samogitia and Curonian and Prussian fishermen from Rusnė, , Nida, and . Next to the inn a church of Werden (Verdainė) was built in 1550. Heydekrug often sought city rights, but was opposed by Memel and Tilsit in 1721 and 1725. In 1722 Heydekrug became a district center and in 1818 the capital of Landkreis Heydekrug. The settlement was amalgamated with the villages of Werden (Verdainė), Szibben (Žibai), and Cynthionischken (Cintjoniškiai) in 1910, although it still did not receive city rights. Following World War I, the town became part of Lithuania when it acquired the Klaipėda Region in 1923.\n\nThe town was reclaimed by Nazi Germany in 1939 when it reacquired the Memel Territory. In 1941 the town finally received city rights. During World War II, the Stalag Luft VI prisoner-of-war camp was located near Heydekrug; it was the northernmost POW camp within the confines of the German Reich.\n\nThere remain many old buildings in Šilutė: an old post office (1905), a fire station (1911), a court building and prison (1848), a bridge across the Sziesze (Šyša) (1914), an estate of H. Scheu (1818), an old market square, a harbor, railway station and a bridge (1875), and the Vydūnas gymnasium.\n\nThe town, which is a regional center, has a well-developed infrastructure. There is an amateur theatre, a museum, three churches, a few hotels, and many cafés, restaurants, and bars. There are large industrial enterprises in Šilutė as well: Šilutės Rambynas (1842), producing butter and cheese, is one of the oldest factories in the area; Šilutės Baldai (1890); and Šilutės Durpės (1882) which exports approximately 50,000 m of peat. Newly founded enterprises are also prospering: Šilutės Girnos (combined fodder); Žibai; Grabupėliai (meat processing); and EKSA, a subsidiary of the alcohol producer Stumbras. In order to speed up capital investments, the region council has established land tax bonuses for investors.\n\nŠilutė is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

The palace is located on a leafy, riverside sprawl of hills on the banks of the Brunei River, a few kilometres southwest of Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's capital city. The palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It is considered to be the world's largest private residence in terms of floor area, earning it the title of \"world's largest residential palace\".\n\nThe name \"Istana Nurul Iman\" is taken from Malay \"Istana\" and Arabic \"Nur-ol Imaan\" and means \"Palace of the Light of Faith.\" It was designed by Filipino Visayan architect Leandro V. Locsin, who utilized the architectural motif of golden domes and vaulted roofs to echo Brunei's Islamic and Malay influences. The interior of the palace was designed by Khuan Chew, Design Principal of KCA International, whose other works include the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. Construction was handled by Ayala Abbott and Butters, a UK construction firm, and completed in 1984 at a total cost of around US$1.4 billion.\n\nThe title of the \"world's largest palace\" is difficult to ascertain, and controversial, as different countries use their own unique standard to claim that their palace is the largest. Using various definitions, a number of palaces are claimed to be the world’s largest: Istana Nurul Iman, Buckingham Palace, Quirinal Palace, Royal Palace of Madrid, Stockholm Palace, The Forbidden City, The Palace of Versailles, The Royal Palace of Caserta, The Winter Palace, The Louvre Palace, Prague Castle, and Romania’s Palace of the Parliament.\n\nTo be considered for the Guinness World Record, the palace must have been intended for use as a royal residence, and only the combined area of the palace’s indoor floors (a measurement commonly known as floorspace) is considered. As measured by these standards, Guinness World Records currently considers Istana Nurul Iman to hold the title as the \"world's largest residential palace.\"\nUpon completion, Istana Nurul Iman became the largest residential palace in the world and the largest single-family residence ever built. The palace contains 1,788 rooms, which includes 257 bathrooms, a banquet hall that can be expanded to accommodate up to 5,000 guests, a mosque accommodating 1,500 people. The palace also includes a 110-car garage, an air conditioned stable for the Sultan's 200 polo ponies, and five swimming pools. In total, Istana Nurul Iman contains 2,152,782 square feet (200,000 m²) of floorspace. Istana Nurul Iman has 564 chandeliers, 51,000 light bulbs, 44 stairwells and 18 elevators.\n\nThe Sultan takes his official audiences at the palace. The palace is also used for all the state functions of the government of Brunei. In addition, the palace houses the prime minister's office, and serves as the seat of the Brunei government.\n\nIn addition to audience and state rooms, there is a throne chamber used for various formal occasions such as the proclamation of the crown prince and the annual birthday investiture.\n\nHowever, in keeping with its primary use as the Sultan’s personal residence, the palace is the home to Sultan’s 7000 cars in 110 separate garages, which include 365 Ferraris, 275 Lamborghinis, 258 Aston Martins, 172 Bugattis, 230 Porsches, 350 Bentleys, 600 Rolls Royces, 440 Mercedes Benzes, 265 Audis, 237 BMWs, 225 Jaguars and 183 Land Rovers, most of which are custom-made.\n\nThe palace is not open to the public except on the annual Islamic celebration of Hari Raya Aidilfitri (the festival at the end of the Muslim fasting month) when the palace receives about 110,000 visitors over a three-day period where the guests receive gifts of food as well as green packets containing money for young children. The palace is also open to Muslims during 10 days of the Ramadhan period for Tadarus and Tarawih prayer gathering.\n\n\n\n"}

There are five classes in each form for F.1 to F.5, and three classes for F.6 and F.7. There are no school places in F.4 and F.6 allocated to students from other schools.\n\nThe school currently has 68 teachers, of which 66 (97%) hold university degrees; 25 (37.3%) hold higher degrees; 63 (93%) have completed teacher training programs. Education psychologist and social worker are also employed to support the school's work. All teachers in the school are eager to enrich themselves by further study and regular sharing. Classroom observation has long been practised in the school. Moreover, all teachers of English Language and Putonghua have met the requirements of the Language Proficiency Assessment.\n\nThe school practices Christian education. The school actively promotes education on Christianity through classes on religious education, morning assembly, weekly assembly, Christian fellowship, Girl's Brigade, gospel camp, sports events, cell groups, prayer groups and crusade. The Shatin Methodist Church works closely with the school on holding various activities and camps to nurture students' spirituality and leadership. Youth music worship is held every Saturday.\n\nSince the implementation of School Management Initiative in 1992, the school has been drawing up plans according to the school administration cycle. Representatives of teachers, parents, alumni and local community are among the school managers.\n\nThe school received funding from the Government's Quality Education Fund on a number of creative education projects. These include: Green School Campaign, Multi-media Language Lab, Chinese Orchestra, Western Orchestra, General Education on Chinese Medicine, Digital Music and Creative Art Workshop, Millennium Multi-media Classrooms, General Education on Chinese Medicine and Resource Centre, Campus TV, to provide a platform for enhancing teaching effectiveness. With the support from the SAR Government, the Church and the community, the school has in recent years organised study tours to Beijing, Sichuan, Yunnan, Sanshui, Lianshan, Zhaoqing, Xian and Macau, Singapore as well as to Korea. To tie in with the objective of broadening horizons, the school has set up a student grant on overseas studies, so that all students have the opportunity to enrich their learning experience.\n\nA number of seed programmes have been carried out in collaboration with the Curriculum Development Institute of EDB in recent years, with a view to introducing curriculum that enriches learning experience. A number of teachers have been seconded to EDB to take part in the development and optimisation of the curriculum on Gifted Education, Science Education, History Education, Integrated Humanities and Liberal Studies. The curriculum so developed was implemented in the school and the experience applied to other schools in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition, the curriculum on Integrated Humanities at HKCEE level has been implemented in the school since 2003. A number of electives are available at senior secondary level, and AS level subjects of Liberal Studies, Computer Application, Mathematics and Statistics are offered to broaden students' horizons.\n\nApart from general subjects, the school implemented a formal curriculum on Moral and Civic Education to nurture civic awareness among students. Culture experiential activities and reading day are organised from time to time. The school also set up the first Chinese Herbal Medicine Learning Center in Hong Kong to provide learning opportunities in Chinese herbal medicine. A curriculum of general education on Chinese Medicine is incorporated in regular classes in F.2.\n\nIn 2002, the school was selected as one of the twenty outstanding schools and a 'Resource School' to share its experience with fellow schools in Hong Kong. Apart from three to four sharing sessions on different themes held every month, an open forum was held on 13 June 2003 and a journal was published. Another Knowledge Fair was held in November 2008 to celebrate the school's 25th Anniversary and to serve as a platform to share the school-based curriculum projects with the other schools.\n\nIn 2006, the school was invited as a pilot school under the Professional Development Scheme, School Support Partners Scheme, and Partnership for Improvement of Learning and Teaching project to further enhance quality education and share its experience with other schools.\n\nIn 2004, EMB conducted a comprehensive External School Review to the school. The assessment covered fourteen items in four main areas, for which the school obtained grading of \"Excellent\" or \"Good\".\n\nIn recent years, the school has secured funding from Quality Education Fund for the improvement of school facilities and provision of gifted education. The funding on IT project alone amounted to $2.2 million, which helped to set up the Multi-media Learning Centre, the Millennium Multi-media Classroom and the Digital Music and Creative Art Workshop. The school also set up a Campus TV station on production of videos and clips, which is welcome by students.\n\nThe new Campus TV production center is equipped with the hypothesized background, analogy shade effect and class broadcast system which provides each classroom with live broadcast video and 24 hours x 7 days access through the Intranet.\n\nThe recent External School Review report highly praises the school's IT facilities. The overall provision of IT facilities in the school was excellent.\n\nThe students of the school perform well in public examinations.\n\nHong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education\n\nHong Kong Certificate of Education Examination\nHong Kong Advanced Level Examination\nHong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination\nThere are three classes of F.6 and F.7 students, each containing more than 90 students. In the past years, 2004 to 2008, the average percentage of students being admitted to universities (both local and overseas) was over 80%, of which about 50% were offered degree programmers in the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Science and Technology. Students being offered degree courses, associate degree courses, high degree courses are more than 90%. Students' performance and prospects are good.\n\nThe school provides opportunities for every student to develop his potential. The curriculum is so revised as to immerse the elements advocated by gifted education in teaching and learning. Apart from this, students are encouraged to excel and take part in high level learning activities. These include the government's gifted training programmes, IIISP, study tour on Chinese herbal medicine by the Institute of Chinese Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong and learning activity held in the Chinese Herbal Medicine Gallery by the School of Chinese Medicine, Baptist University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe school took part in a global study project with the Chinese University of Hong Kong by installing the Cosmic Ray Telescope in the campus. Students had the opportunity to research and study with scholars from the world. The project was completed successfully.\n\nVisiting experts and scholars in recent years include Professor Liu Ruihua (Guangzhou Institute of Geography), Professor Wu Jialin, Dr. Zhao Zhenzhong (School of Chinese Medicine, Baptist University of Hong Kong), Mr. Tam Siu Cheung (antique map collector), Professor Liu Wenxia (Inner Mongolia Normal University), Professor Cong Chunyu (former Director of Gansu College of Traditional Chinese Medicine) . EMB has on several occasions arranged visits of mainland professional education bodies to the school. Both teachers and students greatly benefited from these academic and professional exchanges.\n\n\n"}

James began DJing in New Jersey, in the mid-1980s. His pseudonym, the 45 King, came from his ability to make beats using obscure 45 RPM records.\n\nThe 45 King first gained fame with his breakbeat track \"The 900 Number\" in 1987. The song featured a looping of a baritone sax solo from Marva Whitney's \"Unwind Yourself\" (1968). The 45 King signed with Tuff City Records that year and was given a production deal. \"The 900 Number\" remains his signature work, having been resampled by many artists. He was also featured on the \"1989-Hustlers Convention\" album on the UK label Music of Life, which is considered by many to be hip-hop's first-ever live album.\n\nUsing his popularity from the previous release, the 45 King was able to help the other members of his crew, dubbed the Flavor Unit, which included many well-known hip-hop acts including Chill Rob G, Lakim Shabazz, Apache, and Queen Latifah. The 45 King's big break came when Queen Latifah signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1989 and released the album \"All Hail the Queen\". The 45 King did extensive production on this album, and it is considered by critics to be among his best production work. Over the next few years, many other Flavor Unit members also signed with Tommy Boy, and the 45 King frequently contributed to their albums with his productions. In November 1989, the re-release of \"The King is Here\" / \"The 900 Number\" peaked at #60 in the UK Singles Chart, his only appearance in a UK chart.\n\nIn the early 1990s, drug addiction took its toll on the 45 King's career, which caused him to lose a production deal that he signed with Warner Bros. Records. Around this time the 45 King released multiple series of breakbeat records (the \"Lost Breakbeat\" series, the \"Breakapalooza\" series, etc.) and remixed Madonna's Top-10 single \"Keep It Together\", but he stayed mainly with his breakbeat record franchises.\n\nIn July 1990, Manchester-born DJ Chad Jackson sampled \"The 900 Number\" on his single \"Hear the Drummer (Get Wicked)\", which reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart. A remixed version was also a minor UK hit in 2007. Jackson was apparently unaware that the song had itself been sampled from the original \"Unwind Yourself\", as he credited himself, and King, as co-writers of the song.\n\nIn 1996, Washington, D.C.-based go-go artist DJ Kool had a hit with the song \"Let Me Clear My Throat\". It was a call-and-response vocals over a chopped half of the \"900 Number\" beat. DJ Kool did not just sample the track: he also acknowledged the 45 King as the song's originator, and the 45 King remixed the track for Kool.\n\nIn 1998, the 45 King produced \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\" for Jay-Z. The song was a hit that featured a looped chorus from the original cast album of the Broadway musical \"Annie\". Jay-Z also did an interview when he spoke about how important the 45 King has been to hip hop music and considers him a true pioneer of the business. In 2000, he produced the platinum-certified track \"Stan\" for Eminem.\n\n\n\n"}

He collected a Second Division title winner's medal in 1982, enabling him to experience First Division football for the first time yet. He helped Luton retain their First Division status, and was a key part of the team that finished a club record high of seventh in the 1986–87 season. In 1987–88, he helped Luton win their first major trophy as they achieved a shock 3–2 win over Arsenal in the 1988 Football League Cup Final.\n\nIn October 1988, Donaghy departed from Kenilworth Road in a £650,000 move to his boyhood heroes Manchester United. It was at the time a big risk for Alex Ferguson to pay out a large sum of money for a 31-year-old, but Donaghy repaid the United manager's faith in him with some consistent performances in not only his favoured central defensive position but also as a full-back.\n\nImmediately after joining United, Donaghy was the club's first-choice left-back for the 1988–89 season, missing only the League Cup game for which he was cup-tied. However, his opportunities were limited in the 1989–90 season, and he was unable to make even the substitutes bench for the 1990 FA Cup Final triumph over Crystal Palace. However, he did make the substitutes bench for the European Cup Winners' Cup triumph in 1990–91.\n\nUnited were First Division runners-up in 1991–92 and won their first-ever League Cup, but Donaghy's first-team chances continued to be restricted and he was also left out of the side that beat Nottingham Forest in the League Cup final.\n\nHis next move was in August 1992 when, just a month short of his 35th birthday, Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield paid £100,000 for his services.\n\nDonaghy helped Chelsea finish 11th in the inaugural Premier League season and helped them reach the FA Cup final in 1993–94, although he did not make the squad for the team that lost 4–0 to Double-winners Manchester United. At the end of that season, Donaghy announced his retirement from club football.\n\nHe made his final appearance for Northern Ireland against Mexico in Miami in June 1994, three months before his 37th birthday.\n\nShortly after his playing career ended, Donaghy returned to the province with his family and after a brief spell as manager at Newry Town, he had stints as a coach with Cliftonville and as a Youth Development Officer back on his home patch with Donegal Celtic. In 2000, he was appointed to his present position as coach for the Northern Ireland Under-19 team.\n\nHis son Ciaran currently plays for Carrick Rangers.\n\nThe first of his 91 caps came in May 1980 at Windsor Park in the 1–0 Home International Championship victory over Scotland. He further enhanced his reputation during the 1982 and 1986 World Cup finals. In the former tournament, he played in four of Northern Ireland's five games. He was sent off after 60 minutes of the famous 1–0 win over Spain in Valencia, for the offence of shoving Spain's José Antonio Camacho, but returned for Northern Ireland's final match, the 4–1 defeat by France in Madrid.\n\n\n\n"}

These include but are not limited to dead reckoning, map and compass, astronomical positioning and, more recently, global positioning.\n\nWayfinding can also refer to the traditional navigation method used by indigenous peoples of Polynesia. The ancient Polynesians and Pacific Islanders mastered the way of wayfinding to explore and settle on the islands of the Pacific, many using devices such as the Marshall Islands stick chart. With these skills, some of them were even able to navigate the ocean as well as they could navigate their own land. Despite the dangers of being out at sea for a long time, wayfinding was a way of life. Today, The Polynesian Voyaging Society tries-out\nthe traditional Polynesian ways of navigation. In October 2014, the crew of the\nHokuleʻa arrived on another island in Tonga.\n\nRecently, wayfinding has been used in the context of architecture to refer to the user experience of orientation and choosing a path within the built environment. Kevin A. Lynch used the term (originally \"way-finding\") for his 1960 book \"The Image of the City\", where he defined way-finding as \"a consistent use and organization of definite sensory cues from the external environment.\" \n\nIn 1984 environmental psychologist Romedi Passini published the full-length \"Wayfinding in Architecture\" and expanded the concept to include the use of signage and other graphic communication, visual clues in the built environment, audible communication, tactile elements, including provisions for special-needs users.\n\nThe wayfinding concept was further expanded in a further book by renowned Canadian graphic designer Paul Arthur, and Romedi Passini, published in 1992, \"Wayfinding: People, Signs and Architecture.\" The book serves as a veritable wayfinding bible of descriptions, illustrations, and lists, all set into a practical context of how people use both signs and other wayfinding cues to find their way in complex environments. There is an extensive bibliography, including information on exiting information and how effective it has been during emergencies such as fires in public places.\n\nWayfinding also refers to the set of architectural or design elements that aid orientation. Today, the term wayshowing, coined by Per Mollerup, is used to cover the act of assisting way finding. describes the difference between wayshowing and way finding, and codifies the nine wayfinding strategies we all use when navigating in unknown territories. However, there is some debate over the importance of using the term wayshowing, some argue that it merely adds confusion to a discipline that is already highly misunderstood.\n\nIn 2010 AHA Press Published \"WAYFINDING FOR HEALTHCARE Best Practices for Today's Facilities\", written by Randy R. Cooper. The book takes a comprehensive view of Wayfinding specifically for those in search of medical care.\n\nWhilst wayfinding applies to cross disciplinary practices including architecture, art and design, signage design, psychology, environmental studies, one of the most recent definitions by Paul Symonds et al. defines wayfinding as \"The cognitive, social and corporeal process and experience of locating, following or discovering a route through and to a given space\". Wayfinding is an embodied and sociocultural activity in addition to being a cognitive process in that wayfinding takes places almost exclusively in social environments with, around and past other peoples and influenced by stakeholders who manage and control the routes through which we try to find our way. The route is often one we might take for pleasure, such as to see a scenic highway, or one we take as a physical challenge such as trying to find the way through a series of caves showing our behavioural biases. Wayfinding is a complex practice that very often involves several techniques such as people-asking (asking people for directions) and crowd following and is thus a practice that combines psychological and sociocultural processes.\n\nIn addition to the built environment, the concept of wayfinding has also recently been applied to the concept of career development and an individual's attempt to create meaning within the context of career identity. This was addressed in late August in the NPR podcast You 2.0: How Silicon Valley Can Help You Get Unstuck. The wayfinding concept is also similar to information architecture, as both use information-seeking behaviour in information environments. Tate, a UX designer, pointed out in his blogpost the language used when interacting with computers is thought of spatially, like “browsing the web, surfing the net, going home, etc”. He focuses on showing how Lynch’s model can be applied to information environments, which are places users go “to satisfy an information need”. He shows how berrypicking is very much about wayfinding, as when people go from A to B they pick up new pieces of information along the way, to confirm they are moving in the right direction.\n\nIn Lynch's \"The Image of the City,\" he created a model of cities as a framework on which to build wayfinding systems. The 5 elements are what he found people use to orient themselves with a mental map. They are:\n\n\n\nExpanding on Mollerup's nine wayfinding strategies mentioned above, they are:\n\n\nGoing further with the cognitive process, understanding it helps to build a better wayfinding system as designers learn how people navigate their way around and how to use those elements.\n\nChris Girling uses a cyclical model to explain how our decisions and actions change as we move. “Our brains are constantly sensing information, co-ordinating movement, remembering the environment and planning next steps”. The model shows how our perception can influence what information we seek out, such as some signage being too small to read or even too high up. Once we find the information we want, we make a decision which will depend on previous experiences. Finally we move, during which we look for more information to confirm that we made the right decision for our journey. The cognitive load of this will vary from person to person, as some will know the journey well while it is new to others. This understanding helps designers develop empathy for the user, as they research and test various wayfinding systems adapted to each context.\n\nModern wayfinding has begun to incorporate research on why people get lost, how they react to signage and how these systems can be improved.\n\nAn example of an urban wayfinding scheme is the Legible London Wayfinding system.\n\nNashville, Tennessee has introduced a live music wayfinding plan. Posted outside each live music venue is a guitar pick reading Live Music Venue.\n\nIndoor wayfinding in public buildings such as hospitals is commonly aided by kiosks, indoor maps, and building directories. Such spaces that involve areas outside the normal vocabulary of visitors show the need for a common set of language-independent symbols.\nOffering indoor maps for handheld mobile devices is becoming common, as are digital information kiosk systems. \n\nOther frequent wayfinding aids are the use of color coding and signage clustering -- used to order the information into a hierarchy and prevent the issue of information overload.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) represented a milestone in helping to make spaces universally accessible and improving wayfinding for users.\n\nSignage is the most visual part of wayfinding. A good wayfinding system needs well designed signage, but it also has to be well placed and to match the user’s language.\n\nThere are four types of signs most commonly used which help navigate users and give them appropriate information. They are:\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Ghost Town section of the park, south of the main entrance. It is the tallest and longest wooden coaster on the West Coast of the United States.\nThe ride was formerly manufactured by the defunct Custom Coasters International. Construction on the attraction proceeded so quickly that the coaster was completed and opened nearly six months ahead of schedule. In August 1999, an unsecured piece of wood from the track was lifted by a passing train and thrown into the queue. Five people sustained minor injuries and the attraction was temporarily closed for inspection and retrofitting of the track.\n\nOn August 20, 2015, it was announced that GhostRider would be refurbished and restored for Ghost Town's 75th anniversary. The refurbishment, conducted by Great Coasters International, began on September 8, 2015, and was completed in June 2016. The refurbishment saw the replacement and re-profiling of most of the track, the removal of the mid-course brake run and the replacement of the PTC trains with GCI's Millennium Flyer trains. In September of 2018 the mid-course brake run was re-installed.\n\nRiders approach the ride near the entrance to Ghost Town. The queue begins in a mining tunnel and leads into the mine-themed queue house. After a wait in both levels of the queue, riders board one of the three GCI Millennium Flyer trains of the ride. The trains themselves are colored gold, silver, and copper similar to the precious mining metals.\n\nThe tunnel entrance was once part of the Pan for Gold attraction. As of May 2016, Pan for Gold has returned to its former location and the queue for GhostRider now snakes around it. \n\nThere is a small initial descent into a ravine, which is followed by a gradual sweep to the right. Trains then pass through the transfer track and climb the lift hill. At the top, riders descend a drop, turning left and rising up over an airtime hill before making a sweeping left-hand turnaround. After the turnaround, riders descend another drop, and rise up a gradual right-hand climb, before descending into the structure of the lift hill, and rising up into the ride's midway turnaround.\n\nThe turnaround starts the second half of the ride. Diving off a straight section which was where midcourse brakes used to be, riders descend a steep drop, making a left-hand turn, rising over an airtime hill, before making a right-hand turnaround underneath the turnaround in the first half. After rising over another airtime hill, the trains enter a 450-degree downward helix to the right, before rising over a final hill and hitting the final brake run.\n\nThe ride follows an L-shaped double out and back pattern. Most of the attraction resides on the parking lot near the marketplace. The ride crosses over Grand Avenue four times, road connecting southbound Beach Boulevard to the parking lots. The first two in the first half and last two in the second half. \n\nThe initial drop was covered with a “scream shed” shortly after opening with a metal overhang after nearby residents complained of excessive noise. At night, orange rope lights light up the handrails of the ride.\n\nOver the sixteen years of GhostRider's operation, the trains have gone through several different design updates. The PTC trains were originally delivered, Copper was a dark brown, Silver was a flat gray, and Gold was a light brown. All trains sported the standard \"Knott's\" logo on the front of the train. Later on, ride logos were added and a metallic sheen added onto Gold and Copper trains. Lastly, the third update added airbrush effects on the sides of the individual cars along with a customized \"Knott's GhostRider\" logo on the front. Also Copper was repainted to a more metallic orange/copper.\n\nAlthough the ride has three trains, only two are in use at any time. The third train is usually being maintained and will be switched out with one of the other trains during the duration of the year. Each train is gets a maintenance overhaul during the year. After the 2016 refurbishment, the trains were replaced with Great Coasters International's Millennium Flyer trains. As of November 2019, only the Gold and Silver trains are operating, while Copper is under maintenance.\n\n"}

{"id": "1796150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796150", "title": "Mobile business development", "text": "Mobile business development\n\nMobile business development is a category of business development which focuses on attracting new customers in the Mobile Web markets. There are large efforts being made to make innovative mobile ICT services work. Examples of these services include mobile tourist guides and shopping guides for consumers. As an emerging trend, technology and service providers combine their expertise and resources to design these services. This incorporates designing several models: the Value network, a Value proposition, a Revenue model and a Technological architecture.\n\nTogether contributors need to create a business model that forms the blueprint of the cooperating network of organisations intends to create economic value from technological innovation. Therefore, it is useful to define the different relevant issues: Customer Value of services, Organizational arrangements, Technological architecture, and possible financial arrangements.\n\nA business model is:\n\n\nTo facilitate the collaboration between the contributors, the methods can be used to act as a guideline for successful innovation during the pre-product phase. Most methods are based on the innovation prototyping method (3), which emphasizes on the balance between different viewpoints.\n\nThe relative large amount of contributing organisations in innovative ICT services has been the cause of important changes that took place in the value chain of these services.\nTraditionally, one company would perform all necessary activities that make the service work. Nowadays, this is often divided between specialized contributors. This invokes the creation of and ad hoc value net, which replaces the more traditional value chain. In this value web there is less hierarchy and it is more adaptable to changes in roles or contributors. There are also no restrictions on the flow of data between the value net, instead it can flow in all directions all the time.\n\nThe following definition of a value net can be found in the book \"Value Nets: Breaking the Supply Chain to unlock hidden profits\", by David Bovet and Joseph Martha, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 2000:\n\n\"A value net is a business design that uses digital supply chains to achieve both superior customer satisfaction and company profitability. It is a fast, flexible system that is aligned with and driven by new customer choice mechanisms. A value net is not what the term supply chain conjures up. It is no longer just about supply, but it is also about creating value for customers, the company and its suppliers.\"\n\nThe value net differs from the traditional value chain in the sense that it is not a sequential, rigid chain. Instead, it is a dynamic, high performance network of customer/supplier partnerships and information flows.\nThe Value Proposition model is used to represent the value of the service from the perspective of the end-user (Customer, Consumer). This model is often surprisingly complex for the design of mobile ICT services. This is because the characteristics are very different from physical products. The SHIP-acronym can be used to define four important characteristics of mobile ICT services (3):\n\n\nA value proposition model incorporates the consequences of these characteristics into the development process. This model can be in the form of a textual/graphic model, or even a demonstration version of the proposed service. The composition of the Value Proposition forces the designers to think about different important characteristics of mobile ICT services, the FBBM method addresses the following issues in this context 10:\n\n\nThe information about service-characteristics that are gathered in this part of the Method is usually sketched in use-cases diagrams. This illustrates the part how the proposed services would interact with the end-user.\n\nA Revenue model is used to identify all cash flows concerning the service. These are all costs and revenues that are the result of economic activities. Therefore, the value of each activity must be measured (or approximated) using performance indicators. In the model, the cash flows can be described qualitative at first (high, medium, low) and more in detail at later stages of the development process. The model uses lines representing in- and outgoing cash flows between the value activities and the actors drawn the model. The meta-model consists of the financial arrangements, which describe the costs and the revenues of a service, using performance indicators.\n\nThe Technological Architecture model is used to give an overview of the technical functions, and infrastructure needed to provide the service. For example, the way information is stored, or content is generated and broadcast. Although will be a high-level view of the technological architecture, it can be passed to technical developers who add more detail at a later stage of the development the ICT service.\n\nAfter exploring possible or desired Customer value of services model, Organizational arrangements model, financial arrangements Model and Technological Architecture model, are finalized.\nThis means that they take on their concrete form by actual companies and organizations. This means that the contributing organizations have to fill-in their positions in the value net and decide and negotiate the various design choices for the models.\n\nA good mobile business development method should have a metadata model can be similar to the meta models below.\n\nThe outcome, in the form of a business model can be used to communicate an innovative ICT project outline to investors/participants. It describes the proposed value chain in great detail, because it consists of an overview of the sub models (Customer Value of services, Organisational arrangements, Financial arrangements and Technological architecture) that are balanced. In the total scope of the development of an innovative IT service, a business plan is very helpful in the decision process within the organisations of the participants.\n\nMethods can be designed with the use of Situational method engineering. Situational method engineering can be described as the creation of an ad hoc method from fragments (method fragments) from known methods. This enables the creation of development methods to be me suitable for any development situation.\n\nIn case of mobile business development, there are methods available for specific parts of the business model design process and ICT development. Situational method engineering can be used to combine these methods into one unified method that adopts the characteristics of mobile ICT services.\n\nThe method fragments frequently used in mobile development are (6):\n\n\n\"Shop owners in all large shopping mall have a plan to enrich the shopping experience in their mall. They want to develop a wireless application to be used on smart phones or on PDAs, which will be made available for rent at the entrance. The application will have an informative and an entertainment component. This way, the shop owners hope that they will create added value for their customers and improve their competitiveness.\"\n\nBecause there are many contributors to the development of the application (shop owners, (wireless) network provider, hardware provider), the business model is very complex in this case.\n\nThe contributors have composed their interpretation of the Value Proposition, the Value Network, the Revenue model and the Technological architecture in a first quick scan. At several more sessions during the pre-product development stage, these work models were compared and balanced. This process then was repeated until all contributors are satisfied with the resulting business model. The end result is a thought through, and working innovative application that is slowly starting to generate more sales for the participants.\n\n\"The museum of modern arts has become inspired by other museums to use modern technology to guide its visitors through the museum. It plans to develop a wireless application that runs on museum owned pda's that are lent out to visitors at the entrance. The application uses gps to determine the position of the visitor and streaming video and audio to take on the role as museum guide.\"\n\nThe museum board has demanded the creation of a solid business model. The business model will be the basis for future decisions about the project and to explain the project to the museums donators.\n\nThe museum has found a partner for its project, a wireless Internet provider (WISP) will provide the network and hardware for the application. The WISP can use the museum for promotional activities in return.\n\nTogether they have composed their interpretation of the Value Proposition, the Value Network, the Revenue model and the Technological architecture in a first quick scan. At several more sessions during the pre-product development stage, these work models were compared and balanced. This process then was repeated until both contributors are satisfied with the resulting business model. The end result is a rich media application that is beneficial to the visitors experience and a clear display of wireless capability for future clients of the WISP.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film rights were acquired by director Michael Crichton, and the movie was produced by Martin Erlichmann for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The cast includes Geneviève Bujold, Michael Douglas, Elizabeth Ashley, Richard Widmark, and Rip Torn. Among the actors in smaller roles are Tom Selleck, Lois Chiles, and Ed Harris.\n\nThe story was adapted again into a two-part television miniseries broadcast September 2012 on A&E television network.\n\nDr. Susan Wheeler is a surgical resident at Boston Memorial Hospital. Susan is devastated when a patient, Nancy Greenly, who happens to be her best friend, is pronounced brain-dead and comatose there after an attempted abortion. Her suspicions are aroused when another young and otherwise healthy patient, Sean Murphy, also falls comatose during knee surgery for a recent sports injury. Susan finds that over the previous year an unusual number of other fit, young people have suffered the same fate. She discovers three similarities among the cases: they all took place in the same operating room, all patients were tissue-typed and all the comatose bodies were moved to a remote facility called the Jefferson Institute.\n\nShe offends Chief of Anesthesiology, Dr. George – a powerful figure in the hospital whose wife is also an heiress – by asking to review the relevant case patient charts. Increasingly isolated and under mounting pressure from superiors and colleagues, she wonders whether she can even trust her own boyfriend, Dr. Mark Bellows. She also visits the morgue where a postmortem examination is being performed on Nancy, who had since died. The pathologists are puzzled, and this leads to speculation on how to commit the perfect murder, to which one of the pathologists suggests carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nSusan is called into the office of Chief of Surgery, Dr. George Harris, owing to her trouble with Dr. George, and is given a weekend off to recuperate from the loss of her friend. She and Mark travel to the seaside and spend a relaxing weekend together. Driving back to Boston they see a sign for the Jefferson Institute. Following an access road, a mysterious, imposing and unmarked concrete building reveals itself. Susan wants both of them to go inside, but Mark declines, allowing her to go alone while he waits in the car. After pressing the buzzer at the entrance, she is greeted by Nurse Emerson. Susan announces herself as Dr. Susan Wheeler, and asks if she can enter, but is informed that the facility is closed, but that the next tour for physicians is Tuesday morning.\n\nReturning to join the tour, Susan finds what is apparently an advanced, low-cost care facility for comatose patients. However, while investigating the large areas of the building that were left unvisited, she discovers that the institute is a front for black-market organ sales, where the patients' organs are sold to the highest bidder. Boston Memorial purposely induce comas in select patients whose organs match those of potential buyers. The patients are rendered brain-dead via covert carbon monoxide poisoning through a line that leads from a tank in the basement to the OR, the valve for which is controlled by a radio signal.\n\nWhile she investigates the Jefferson Institute, Susan is caught on surveillance cameras. She manages to escape security atop the roof of an ambulance leaving to transport harvested organs to Logan Airport. Susan thinks that Dr. George is the mastermind of the scheme, and rushes to her supervisor, Dr. Harris, with whom she has been confiding, and explains what she has discovered. Dr. Harris offers her a drugged drink which begins to incapacitate Susan while also causing severe abdominal pain that mimics appendicitis. As she loses consciousness, Dr. Harris phones in an emergency from his office and offers to perform the appendectomy on Susan himself. As they are preparing for surgery, Dr. Harris is informed that his preferred operating room is not available. His vehement insistence upon using room eight arouses the suspicions of Mark, who finds the gas tank and line to room eight – disconnecting it before the carbon monoxide can permanently injure Susan. Susan awakens after surgery, much to Dr. Harris' surprise, and is wheeled out of the operating room holding Mark's hand. A defeated Dr. Harris is left back in operating room eight, while two police officers wait outside to arrest him.\n\n\nMichael Crichton was a friend of Cook. They met when Crichton was doing post-doctoral work in biology at La Jolla's Salk Institute and Cook was a Navy physician stationed at San Diego. Crichton described the film as like a \"Western... if the doctors are the bad guys they are also the good guys.\" Crichton says that even though the lead in the book was a female the studio talked about getting Paul Newman to play it, but he fought it. \"If a man had done the movie, it would be a much more conventional thing.\"\n\nFilming started June 20, 1977. Shooting took place at Boston City Hospital and the University of Southern California's dissection room. The mysterious, Brutalist-style building that served as the film's \"Jefferson Institute\" was at the time of filming a regional headquarters of Xerox Corporation located in Lexington, Massachusetts. It currently serves as head office of Stride Rite, an American children's footwear company.\n\nMichael Douglas called the film \"the first time I've been offered a project with a good story laid out well, a good cast, and a good director.\" The film cost $4.1 million but this was off-set by a pre-sale to TV worth $3 million.\n\n\"Coma\" was a box-office success, earning $50 million US (about $185 million in 2016 U.S. dollars). It was well received by critics and audiences. The film holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 26 reviews.\n\n"}

The hulls of the \"Avenger\"-class ships are constructed of wood with an external coat of fiberglass.\n\n\"Guardian\" was laid down on 8 May 1985 by Peterson Builders, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin; launched on 20 June 1987; and commissioned on 16 December 1989. In 2010, she became the first mine countermeasures vessel in the Seventh Fleet modified for a mixed-sex crew, with separate head facilities.\n\nOn 17 January 2013, \"Guardian\" ran aground on Tubbataha Reef, in a protected area of the Philippines in the middle of the Sulu Sea. The vessel was turned and pushed further onto the reef by wave action. Unable to be recovered, the vessel was decommissioned and struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 15 February 2013. After removal of fuel and useful equipment, and after the upper superstructure was cut and lifted off of the minehunter, the wooden hull was sequentially chainsawed into four sections and lifted off of the reef by the dynamic positioning crane vessel MV Jascon 25. The bow section was cut and removed by crane on 26 March 2013. It was originally planned to cut the hull into three pieces, but the stern section had to be cut in half again. The last stern section was removed by crane from Tubbataha Reef on 30 March 2013.\n\nIn late November 2007, USS \"Guardian\" and sister minesweeper sought refueling and refuge from an approaching storm in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, but were denied entry without explanation by the People's Republic of China. Both ships were eventually refueled at sea and returned safely to their homeports in Japan.\n\nIn February 2010, USS \"Guardian\" became the first mine countermeasures vessel in the Seventh Fleet to receive the Women-at-Sea modification, which was intended to allow the small vessel to accommodate a mixed-sex crew. The modification added no additional sleeping space, but did provide for separate head facilities for female crew members. However, with the exception of a very few officers, all mine countermeasures vessels in the Seventh Fleet were still manned by all-male crews at that time.\n\nOn 17 January 2013, following a port call and fuel stop in Subic, \"Guardian\" proceeded across the Sulu Sea, and entered the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park where she grounded at 2:25 am. About 90 minutes after the grounding, she was seen on park radar at approximately 04:00 hours local time. \"Guardian\" ran aground on Tubbataha Reef about south east of Palawan in the Philippines. At the time of the accident, the ship was travelling from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Indonesia. The extent of any damage to the reef was unknown, but there was no evidence of fuel leaks. Philippines officials estimate the damage to the reef at 1,000 square meters. \nThe second night aground the ship shifted and began taking heavy persistent seas to her port side. DC2 Jeff Macatangay and MN3 Pekarcik navigated a tangle of machinery and pipes in the ship's bilge while it filled with water to construct shoring on the keel, greatly slowing flooding and bought the ship four hours of available power and communications. They were awarded the Navy and Marine Corps medal for their actions in the dynamic-hazardous environment.\n\nThe next day, 18 January 2013, the U.S. Navy evacuated all 79 crew members from the minesweeper to the USNS \"Bowditch\" and MV \"C Champion\". In recognition of his actions in evacuating the sailors aboard \"Guardian\", Petty Officer Travis Kirckof, a mineman aboard USS \"Guardian\" and one of the two assigned Search and Rescue (SAR) swimmers, was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal on 11 April 2014. Petty Officer Kirckof joined by Petty Officer Nick Martin and Matthew Pekarcik stayed in the shark-infested water for almost five hours to assist his shipmates in the evacuation to the nearby reef, saving at least two lives.\n\nOn 19 January 2013, an assessment team deployed to plan and execute the vessel's extraction. On 20 January 2013, \"Navy Times\" reported the ship was taking on water in multiple places and experiencing a slight list to port.\n\nOriginally, only the bow section of \"Guardian\" rested on the reef, but wave action pushed the entire vessel onto the reef, from the edge. The guided missile destroyer , the oceanographic survey ship and the rescue and salvage ship arrived in the area to help in the intended extraction, as well as tugboats and Philippine navy and coast guard vessels. It was intended for \"Guardian\" to be removed from the area by crane ships from Singapore, then be placed on a barge or other ship, since the ship was too damaged to be towed due to multiple hull penetrations.\n\nOn 29 January 2013, the United States Navy announced the ship would be cut into three sections on the reef prior to removal, resulting in the total loss of the $227 million vessel. USS \"Guardian\" was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 February 2013. On 27 February 2013, salvage workers disassemble \"Guardian\", a process estimated to take a month. The bridge deck was removed on 4 March 2013. On 30 March 2013, the stern section of the ship was lifted off the reef, completing the removal process.\n\nIn February 2013, \"Guardian\" was replaced with in the 7th Fleet, with the crew of \"Warrior\" returning to San Diego, and the crew of \"Guardian\" taking over \"Warrior\".\n\nOn 8 April 2013, the U.S. Navy turned over digital navigation charts and other evidence and documents and data of \"Guardian\" to the Philippine Maritime Casualty Investigating Team (MCIT) and responded to \"Technical and Substantive\" queries. The MCIT will conduct an independent investigation and make recommendations about avoid such incidents in the future. On 26 July 2013 it was reported that a chart produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was inaccurate by up to . This chart was used by the crew of the Guardian, and played a significant role in the grounding. However, significant errors by the crew and commanding officers were also reported, including that they should have noted the inaccuracies in comparison to other charts.\n\nOriginal estimates were that of reef was damaged but a survey done after removal, by the World Wide Fund for Nature–Philippines and the Tubbataha Management Office, measured the damage area at . On January 20, 2015, the United States government paid to the Philippine government a total of 87 million Philippine pesos, or US$1.97 million – 59 million Philippine pesos for the damage and another 29 million pesos to reimburse services provided by the Philippine Coast Guard.\n\nThe U.S. federal government apologized for the incident and relieved four officers: LCDR Mark Rice, Commanding Officer; LT Daniel Tyler, Executive Officer; the Lieutenant (j.g.) who was Officer of the Deck; and a QMC who was Assistant Navigator and Quartermaster of the Watch at the time of the mishap. \"The initial investigation findings clearly indicate that (the four) at the time of the grounding did not adhere to standard US Navy navigation procedures,\" the Manila Bulletin quoted the U.S. Navy as saying. The U.S. government has acknowledged that the grounding was entirely preventable and caused by human error and a failure of leadership to provide adequate oversight and direction in planning and executing the Navigation Plan.\n\nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) admitted that the coastal scale Digital Nautical Chart (DNC) supplied to USS \"Guardian\" was flawed due to human error on the part of the NGA. This mislocated the Tubbataha Reef by east-southeast of its location. NGA was aware of this error in 2011, and modified a smaller scale electronic chart. NGA failed to publish a correction for the larger scale chart the USS \"Guardian\" was using before the navigation officer ran the ship aground. However, the Navy continues to conceal their reasons for USS \"Guardian\" transiting these restricted waters in the first place.\n\n\n\n"}

The station then passed to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\n\nNetwork SouthEast operated and served the station after British Rail Sectorised itself in 1982. South West Trains has operated and served the station since the Privatisation of British Railways in 1996.\n\nTrain destinations are normally , , , and .\n\nTrains are usually routed to via with three services in the morning peak scheduled to go the longer slower route via (included as part of the normal Aldershot to service) and two returning via this route in the evening.\n\nThe typical off-peak service (Monday to Saturday) from the station is:\n\nThere are 2 new TicketXpress ticket vending machines which now reside outside the entrance to the booking hall, making them accessible when the station booking hall is closed. They are available at all times, except when remotely disabled when there is no service, such as at Christmas. These new machines sell tickets to many stations in Great Britain and accept major credit and debit cards.\n\nThe QuickFare self-service ticket machine (removed October 2006) accepted coins and banknotes and issued tickets to a variety of local destinations, as well as issuing tickets for the station car park. Discounts were available for holders of most Railcards. QuickFare ticket machines were used by British Rail and the Train Companies for many years, providing easy access to tickets at unstaffed stations and at times when ticket offices were closed.\n\nThe QuickFare ticket machine at Aldershot station was inside the booking hall on platform one. \nThe place where it once stood is now occupied by the \"scu\" (the control centre that operates the new gateline).\n\nServices are mainly run using a four, eight or twelve car Class 450 and 2 cycles can be carried per train.\nClass 444 Desiro five-car units are seen from time to time.\n\nUp to 2005, ex-British Rail slam-door EMUs were used on the Alton Line, many of which were berthed at the carriage sidings south of Farnham station. The carriage shed at Farnham was built in 1937 around the time that the line was electrified.\n\nThe most commonly operated EMUs in recent years were Class 411, Class 421 and Class 423 units. These trains were withdrawn in 2005, except for a very few that were transferred to the Lymington Branch.\n\nThe station has three platforms. The station entrance and ticket office is by Platform 1. Tracks by Platforms 2 and 3 are signalled for bi-directional operation.\n\nPlatforms 2 and 3 are reached by way of the original subway and a more recent covered footbridge. Lifts are incorporated into the footbridge for disabled access.\n\nAs trains approach Farnham to the south, the mileage suddenly jumps to a higher one. This is because mileages between the site of Farnham Junction (by the electric substation just before the A31 flyover bridge) and (the end of the line that formerly continued to Winchester) are reckoned from via and the now closed line via and . The line from Waterloo via and Aldershot was built significantly later than that via and .\n\nAbout 450m north-east of the station (towards Ash and can be seen from near the end of platform 1) is Aldershot Railway Tunnel, also known as Redan Hill Tunnel. It is 76 yards long.\n\n"}

He went on to play in the Football League for Huddersfield Town and Burnley before finishing his career with non-League club Bacup Borough.\n\nMay started his career with Blackburn Rovers as a trainee before graduating to the first team in the 1988–89 season, mostly playing as a right-back but sometimes playing at centre-back. He made over 100 appearances for the club and was a regular player in the Blackburn team which was promoted to the new Premier League in 1992 and finished as runners-up to Manchester United in the 1993–94 season, having finished fourth a year earlier. May retained his regular place in the Blackburn team after they reached the Premier League, despite the many millions that manager Kenny Dalglish spend on rebuilding the squad ready for a title challenge.\n\nIn July 1994, Manchester United bought May for £1.2 million, as he was apparently unhappy at Blackburn in his final months due to the breakdown in contract negotiations. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had been searching for a defender to add to the squad, and specifically needed an Englishman who would not be affected by the restrictions on foreign players in European competition that were in place at the time. He was also thinking about the future, as centre-back and captain Steve Bruce was in his 34th year and Gary Pallister was approaching 30.\n\nInjuries to first-choice right-back Paul Parker meant that May was often used as a right-back in his first season, and rarely played in his preferred centre-back position due to the strong partnership of Bruce and Pallister. As May underperformed, by the end of the season, Gary Neville had emerged to become the new first-choice right-back, while Parker was rarely used the following season and then left the club.\n\nManchester United finished the season in second place in the Premier League, losing out to May's old club Blackburn Rovers.\n\nMay finally managed to establish himself in the team towards the end of the 1995–96 season as an understudy for Bruce, who was struggling with a hamstring injury, and scored the first goal in the final match of the season against Middlesbrough. The 3–0 victory clinched the title for Manchester United. He was also in the starting line-up for the 1996 FA Cup Final victory over Liverpool, while Bruce was not even selected as a substitute.\n\nBruce departed to Birmingham City soon after, and May became a regular starter in the 1996–97 season, making over 40 appearances and often being paired with Gary Pallister, although a third centre-back, new signing Ronny Johnsen, had been signed in the summer of 1996 and was a regular in the first team. His contributions were important as United retained the league title and also reached the semi-final of the Champions League after a 4–0 victory over Porto in the quarter-final, in which May scored the first goal. His form meant that he received a late call-up to the England national team for a friendly against Mexico, but he never actually won an international cap.\n\nThe purchases of Henning Berg and Jaap Stam as well as the emergence of Wes Brown limited his chances further during the late 1990s and he saw very little action with the first team. However, towards the end of the treble-winning 1998–99 season, May enjoyed a brief comeback as Ferguson rotated his squad to cope with the mounting fixture congestion and United were challenging for the league title, FA Cup and European Cup. He was also named in the starting line-up for the 1999 FA Cup Final as Stam was being rested for the Champions League Final against Bayern Munich. May was named on the bench for that match, and is remembered for the way he led the celebrations after the match, despite not playing one single minute in the Champions League that season. A popular chant with the crowd was \"\"David May, superstar! Got more medals than Shearer!\"\" – in reference to the lack of success enjoyed by May's former Blackburn colleague Alan Shearer, who was one of the finest strikers of his generation but won just one trophy in a career which lasted nearly 20 years at the highest level.\n\nThe following season, May was loaned out to Huddersfield Town, where he played under Steve Bruce. In his first appearance for the Terriers, however, he picked up an injury and had to return for treatment to Old Trafford, where he remained for another three years, but often sidelined by injury and playing mainly in the reserve team. May's last four seasons with United saw him make only 12 appearances in total for the club. Due to his lack of appearances, May collected only two Premier League winner's medals, despite being a squad member for six winning campaigns. May's final competitive appearance for Manchester United came in the League Cup on 3 December 2002 against Burnley.\n\nAt the end of his contract with Manchester United in the summer of 2003, May was given a free transfer and snapped up by Burnley manager Stan Ternent, an old friend of Ferguson's, to bolster his leaky defence. In September 2003 he scored in a 2–1 win against Stoke City, while at the end of the month he was sent off against Wimbledon for two yellow cards.\n\nIn December 2003, May was headbutted by Ternent following a disagreement at the club training ground. They later settled their differences.\n\nHe played 39 times for Burnley during the 2003–04 season, and captained the team on a number of occasions.\n\nMay joined non-League club Bacup Borough in November 2004 where he finished his playing career.\n\nAfter retiring as a player with Bacup Borough, May was appointed assistant manager at the club. In 2007, he moved to Dubai to coach football at a school.\n\nMay was born in Oldham, Lancashire.\n\nSince retiring May has become a wine importer. He is still a keen supporter of former club Manchester United, although he grew up supporting Manchester City. As of 2007, he was a regular presenter of Thursday Focus on MUTV, his old club's TV station.\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nManchester United\n"}
{"id": "1796195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796195", "title": "Porto Metro", "text": "Porto Metro\n\nThe Porto Metro (), part of the public transport (mass transit) system of Porto, Portugal, is a light rail network that runs underground in central Porto and above ground into the city's suburbs. \"Metro do Porto S.A.\" was founded in 1993, and the first line of the system opened in 2002.\n\nThe network has 6 lines and reaches seven municipalities within the metropolitan Porto area: Porto, Gondomar, Maia, Matosinhos, Póvoa de Varzim, Vila do Conde and Vila Nova de Gaia. It currently has a total of 82 operational stations across of double track commercial line. Most of the system is at ground level or elevated, but of the network is underground. The system is run by ViaPORTO.\n\nLine A (blue line) between Senhor de Matosinhos and Trindade in central Porto was the first Porto Metro line to open, in 2002. The line was extended in 2004 to Estádio do Dragão, in time for the Euro 2004 Football championship.\n\nOn April 14, 2005, Line B (red line) opened. The Casa da Música concert hall (which has a station on the combined ABCEF line) opened on the same day. Lines A and B are the last legacy of a line which once went from Trindade to Famalicão, originally narrow gauge, opened in 1875, completed in 1881 and switched to metre gauge in 1930. (The stretch from Varzim to Famalicão is now a bicycle trail.)\n\nLine C (green line) opened on July 30, 2005, reaching the centre of Maia. An extension to ISMAI opened in March 2006. Line C uses a stretch formerly part of the Guimarães line which joined the current line at Lousado.\n\nLine D (yellow line) proved the most problematic to excavate and opened in 2005. The line runs from João de Deus and Vila Nova de Gaia in the south before crossing the River Douro and passing through central Porto en route to São João Hospital in the north. The São João Hospital and IPO stations were not brought into service until April 2006 due to safety concerns. In October 2011, it was extended to Santo Ovídio.\n\nLine E (violet line) opened on May 27, 2006, connecting the Airport Francisco Sá Carneiro and Campanhã. Several weeks later, the line was extended until Estádio do Dragão. An end-to-end journey takes 33 minutes, with trains departing every 20 minutes.\n\nLine F (orange line) opened on January 2, 2011, connecting the Porto city centre to the Gondomar region in the east, this line runs between Senhora da Hora and Fânzeres.\n\nLines A, B, C, E & F follow the same course within the City of Porto (between Estádio do Dragão and Senhora da Hora). The transfer point between Line ABCEF and Line D is at Trindade in central Porto; from Trindade to Senhora da Hora, the right of way recycles the original Porto-Varzim-Famalicão/Maia-Trofa-Guimarães trunk line.\n\nAs of 2007, the total cost of Porto Metro mass transit public transport system stands on 3,500 million euros - over 1% of Portugal's GDP. The first phase of the project alone, which was led by the mayors of several \"Grande Porto\" (Greater Porto) municipalities including Valentim Loureiro as a chairman of the state-owned company, was 140% more expensive than initially planned which means a slippage of over 1,500 million euros. The Porto Metro state-owned company has reported losses every year, reaching a record loss of 122 million euros in 2006.\n\nThe Metro uses modern Eurotram low-floor, articulated trams. New Flexity Swift LRVs are used on line B, Bx and occasionally line C since 2008, and can reach 100 km/h (62.5 mph). They also have more seats, and can, in common with most modern light rail systems, recover 30% of the total of consumed energy during braking.\n\nThe majority of services run with two LRVs coupled together. The Eurotram consists of four main compartments, two in each carriage linked by short corridors, and also features an articulation between the two carriages. They have a capacity of 80 seated and 134 standing passengers.\n\nThe system uses the \"Andante\" ticketing system. Machines in stations issue and can recharge \"Andante Azul\" - blue \"Occasional\" tickets, while \"Andante Gold\" is a credit-card style \"Gold\" tickets (which bear a scanned photograph of the holder) that can be purchased in \"Lojas Andante\" (Andante Shops). Tickets can also be topped up at Multibanco ATM terminals.\n\nThe Porto Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system. Tickets must be validated before travel by scanning them in front of the yellow machines located in stations. A validated occasional ticket allows for unlimited travel within a specified time period, currently 1 hour for the minimum 2-zone ticket, and longer as the number of valid zones increases. The gold passes allow unlimited travel within a pre-defined area, and are available in \"anytime\" or cheaper \"10/16\" (off-peak) versions. There is also a daily ticket, known as \"Andante 24\" that allows the user to make unlimited trips within a given day in the zones chosen. For example, a Z3 (3-zone) ticket is valid for 3 zones in any direction of travel from the first validated zone. So, to cover all of the Metro, except the northernmost part of Line B (zones VCD3 and PV_VC), a Z4 ticket is needed, provided it is validated in zone PRT1.\n\nThere are no faregates within the Metro; instead, groups of fare inspectors randomly check tickets with hand-held scanners. The current penalty for travelling without a validated ticket is €120.\n\nThe metro uses the same zoning system as the majority of public transport providers in the Porto metropolitan area, which is divided by counties, and further divided into numbered sub-zones (for example, VCD3 is the third area of the Vila do Conde county). The PRT1 zone in central Porto is effectively the area contained within the VCI (Via Cintura Interna) inner ring-road, while zones PRT2 and PRT3 are the areas between the VCI and the Estrada da Circunvalação outer ring-road. \n\nThe Andante system is being rolled out across the entire Porto public transit network. STCP bus routes and some other bus routes currently accept Andante and the intention is for the entire bus, metro and suburban train network to become integrated. The same ticket cannot be used on downtown Porto trams and the cable car (Funicular dos Guindais). The \"Andante Azul\" that tourists typically use are not valid, though the \"Andante Gold\" loaded with monthly tickets may be accepted.\n\nLine A or the Blue Line is the main and, historically, most important of the five Porto Metro lines. It has 23 stations.\n\nThe line was opened between Trindade and Senhor de Matosinhos on 7 December 2002, by then Prime Minister Barroso. Until the end of 2002 travel was free of charge to allow users to familiarize themselves with the new light rail line. On June 5, 2004, on the occasion of the Euro 2004 European Football Championship, the section between Trindade and Estádio do Dragão was opened.\n\nTrains run every 10 minutes between 07:00 and 20:00 between Senhor de Matosinhos and Estádio do Dragão, with some trips extended to Fânzeres on Line F. Between 6:00 and 7:00 and after 20:00 the frequency is 15 minutes. After 21:00 trains only run between Senhor de Matosinhos and Trindade.\n\nFlexity Outlook Eurotrams number 001–072 service the line.\n\n\nLine B or the Red Line has 35 stations and is the longest line of the system.\nThe line reuses, for almost its entire length, the route of the old Póvoa Line, which connected Trindade to Póvoa de Varzim. Line B was Porto Metro's second line to open. Initially the line only ran between Estádio do Dragão and Senhora da Hora, thus sharing the route with Line A. On March 13, 2005, an extension was opened between Senhora da Hora and Pedras Rubras. On March 18, 2006, after successive delays, the final section to Póvoa de Varzim was officially inaugurated.\n\nThe line has two types of services between Póvoa de Varzim and Estádio do Dragão: regular, which stops at all stations; and the Bx express, which only stops only at Portas Fronhas, Vila do Conde, Varziela, Mindelo and Pedras Rubras, between Póvoa de Varzim and Senhora da Hora. From early summer 2011 the express service was expanded to operate daily.\n\nIn July 2016, Porto Metro announced that an additional infill station, Modivas Norte, will be added at The Style Outlet. The work is financed 50% by the mall management and will cost a total of €1.2 million. Although no extensions are planned, consideration was given to use the abandoned Famalicão branch to reach Barreiros, near Avenida 25 de Abril, via Mourões. Beyond Póvoa de Varzim the right-of-way has been converted into a cycle path in order to preserve the branch.\n\n\nThe Metro do Porto company also operates the Funicular of Guindais, a cable-car system that was originally built in 1891 and was recently remodelled. It connects the riverside area of Ribeira to higher ground at Batalha, near the São Bento station.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1796209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796209", "title": "Crimpshrine", "text": "Crimpshrine\n\nCrimpshrine was an American punk rock band from Berkeley, California. The group was formed in 1982 by Aaron Cometbus, founder of the seminal punk rock zine \"Cometbus\", and future Operation Ivy vocalist Jesse Michaels. They grew out of the East Bay scene, centered on 924 Gilman Street, and had an important influence on later East Bay bands such as Operation Ivy, Green Day and punk rock in general.\n\nCrimpshrine originally formed in 1982 under the name S.A.G. with Aaron Cometbus playing guitar and Jesse Michaels (later of Operation Ivy) on vocals, both 13 years old. They quickly added friend Jeff Ott, then 12, on drums initially but switched to guitar soon after and Cometbus took over drums. Regarding Ott's guitar skills, Michaels described him as \"twenty times better than us\", as he initially tried to play guitar but \"didn't know any chords, so I played with my thumb.\" According to Elliot, the band had a \"serious lack of equipment\", as they had one drum and only 3 strings on the guitar. Michaels was kicked out of the band in 1984, which he said was for \"smoking too much pot\", and Ott and Cometbus changed the band's name to Crimpshrine. According to Ott, the name came from a nickname for a girl they knew who had \"bleached-blond, burned, crimped hair.\" The group initially wanted a female singer, but couldn't find one so Ott took over on vocals in late 1984 and they then went through various different line-ups during 1985. Ott began experimenting with playing synthesizer and piano, a man named Isaac joined on violin and Tim Armstrong (then known as Lint) played bass for a brief period. Pete Rypins joined as the group's bassist in October 1986 and, according to Cometbus, they \"started to get out of Jeff's basement and play some parties and shows.\"\n\nAfter Rypins joined, they played shows sporadically during its early years, with vocalist Ott living on the streets of Berkeley for a time. In February 1987, the group recorded their first demo tape, which received enough circulation that \"Maximumrocknroll\" asked the band to record songs for the magazine's upcoming compilation \"Turn It Around!\", to which the band agreed and recorded \"Another Day\" and \"Rearranged\" in August. Shortly after, they went to Dangerous Rhythm in Oakland, California to record songs for their debut EP with producer/engineer Kevin Army. David Hayes, co-founder of Lookout Records, was impressed with the band and offered to release the tracks recorded at Dangerous Rhythm. The group agreed and their debut EP \"Sleep, What's That?\" was released in January 1988. Idon Bryant, a friend of the band's, joined on second guitar soon after and they went to Dancing Dog Studios in Emeryville, California to record their debut album in April. Although the recordings were turned down by Lookout, the band added tracks from previous sessions and released \"Lame Gig Contest\" in Germany on the label Musical Tragedies.\n\nCrimpshrine then embarked on their only United States tour in September 1988. The tour was a contentious one, with Idon Bryant and Pete Rypins abruptly leaving the band in Gainesville, Florida and heading home. Stuck in Florida without a bassist, friends Ben Weasel and John Jughead of Screeching Weasel drove out from Chicago to help them out and the former played bass with the band for two shows. A bit later when Screeching Weasel was without a drummer, Cometbus played drums with them for two shows around Chicago. Paul Curran was then courted to join Crimpshrine on bass, so he and his brother Jack drove out in a Ford Pinto and finished the tour with the band. After the tour in January 1989, they went to Dancing Dog Studios again and recorded what would end up being their final release, the \"Quit Talkin' Claude...\" EP.\n\nThe group broke up in May 1989 shortly after the release of the \"Quit Talkin' Claude...\" EP. Cometbus went on to perform in Pinhead Gunpowder among many other bands, Ott went on to front Fifteen, Curran joined Monsula and Rypins became the bassist for Tilt and later The Tantrums.\n\nIn recent years, the band has been regarded as influential by many of their peers, including Operation Ivy, Green Day, Jawbreaker, among others. A tribute album to both Crimpshrine and Fifteen, called \"Can You Spare a Dime?\", was released in 1998 by Microcosm Publishing. Crimpshrine is featured in the 2017 documentary \"\".\n\nAlthough closely associated with the Gilman Street Project, Cometbus was quick to note in a 1988 interview with \"Flipside\" magazine that they were not a direct product of Gilman, having been established as a band years before the launch of the club. \"We helped them as much as they helped us because we are a part of it just as much,\" Cometbus said.\n\nMain members\n\nOther members\n\nStudio albums\n\nEPs\n\nSplit EPs\n\nCompilation albums\n\nOther appearances\n\n"}

He climbed with Joe Brown and Chris Bonington on many new routes, and was considered the technical equal of both.\n\nBorn and brought up in a two-up two-down house in Salford, Lancashire, Whillans began hiking on the Pennine moors while still at Broughton modern school; climbing was the next step for an adventurous young boy.\n\nWhillans was an apprentice plumber when he started his climbing career with Joe Brown in 1951. Whillans met Brown while climbing at the Roaches in Staffordshire. When Brown's climbing partner failed to follow him up a new route, Whillans asked if he could try—and subsequently led the second pitch of Brown's new route, which became known as \"Matinee\".\n\nFrom rock climbing he expanded into mountaineering with trips to the Alps where ascents included the \"Bonatti Pillar\" of the Dru and the first ascent with Chris Bonington, Jan Długosz and Ian Clough of the Central Pillar of Freney on Mont Blanc. In 1962 with Bonington he made the first ascent of the Central Torres del Paine, Patagonia and with Dougal Haston, he made the first ascent of the south face of Annapurna in Bonington's 1970 expedition.\n\nWhillans was attributed with safety and mountain awareness, as evidenced by his retreat from the Eiger North Face on several occasions because of bad weather or rockfall. He had few climbing accidents although there were several near misses, such as when a fixed rope on the Central Torres del Paine snapped and he managed to put his weight on the holds with split-second timing before retying the rope.\n\nWhillans was well regarded for his capacity to deliver a cracking one-liner off the cuff. One example which encapsulates his wry humour concerns him encountering a team of—to his mind—poorly equipped Japanese mountaineers attempting the north face of the Eiger. \"You going up?\" Whillans asked them. \"Yes! Yes!\" came the reply. Pause, then Whillans: \"You may be going a lot higher than you think.\"\n\nWhillans participated in the 1971 International Expedition and 1972 European Everest Expedition, each attempting to climb Mount Everest's southwest face. The latter expedition was plagued with personality conflicts and the withdrawal of many climbers. While in camp, some other climbers overheard news that England had lost a football match to Germany. \"It seems we have beaten you at your national sport\", said a German. After a pause Whillans replied, \"Aye, and we've beaten you at yours...twice.\" Another incident occurred one night in an alpine hut when two climbers were engaged in a whispered conversation disturbing the sleep of other climbers, one of whom was Whillans. Eventually he demanded that they shut up; there was a brief pause before one of the youths aggressively refused to be quiet, remarking into the darkness \"Who do you think you are?\" The gruff reply of \"Whillans\" was followed by complete silence. However, Whillans's biographer Jim Perrin suggests many of these stories are myths. Whillans liked to emphasise his working class credentials, and on lecture tours, enjoyed telling the story of being stormbound in a tent high in the Himalayas with Dougal Haston who had finished reading \"The Lord of the Rings\" and passed him the book. Whillans read a few pages and remarked: \"I'm not reading that crap, it's full of fooking fairies\"!\n\nWhillans was a heavy drinker, which harmed his career after the expedition to Annapurna and may have contributed to his early death. Although he was only 5' 4\" tall, he had a reputation as a brawler and stories of his prowess circulated.\n\nHe designed mountaineering equipment, including the \"Whillans Harness\", once described as designed to safely transport beer-guts to great height, and the \"Whillans-box\" expedition tent.\n\nHe died at the age of 52 of a heart attack and was the subject of a biography titled \"The Villain\" by the author–climber Jim Perrin in 2005.\n\nThe British Mountaineering Council maintain a climbing hut near the Roaches in memory of Whillans.\n\n\n"}

He partnered with George Grant Elmslie, and briefly with George Feick. The firm of Purcell & Elmslie produced designs for buildings in twenty-two states, Australia, and China. The firm had offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Oregon.\n\nPurcell was born in Wilmette, Illinois on July 2, 1880. His parents, Charles A. and Anna Cora Purcell lived first with William Cunningham and Catherine Garns Gray, Anna's parents, in Oak Park, Illinois. Although the Purcells eventually moved into their own home, except for brief periods the young boy remained with his grandparents over the next five years. In 1886, William Gray Purcell began living permanently with them at his own request. His father was an important grain trader, and his grandfather was editor of \"The Interior\", and a writer of national repute.\n\nFor many summers, W. C. Gray had taken fishing vacations on the peninsula of upper Michigan. In 1885, however, he was saddened to realize the extent to which the environment had been despoiled by destructive logging and mining practices. In 1886 Gray arranged the purchase of three square miles of land surrounding an island on a lake in northern Wisconsin, in co-ownership with the recently widowed Nettie Fowler McCormick, also of Chicago. Every following summer from 1887 until his death in 1901, Gray brought his family, friends, and associates to Island Lake Camp, as the isolated forest enclave came to be called.\n\nDuring this time Purcell became skilled as a photographer, his hobby made possible by the newly available commercial outfits which supplied camera, photographic plates, processing chemicals and printing papers in one package. Purcell received his first camera from W. C. Gray in 1888, a Kodak model given to \"The Interior\" office just before public release of the product.\n\nWhen Purcell was fifteen, Frank Lloyd Wright built his Oak Park studio on the same block where Charles A. Purcell lived, not far from the Grays. In Chicago, where Purcell went frequently to visit his grandfather at \"The Interior\" offices, the work of Louis Sullivan continued to impress the young architect-to-be. His mind was already made up to pursue the study of the building arts in college and, following his graduation from Oak Park High School in 1899, he entered the School of Architecture at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.\n\nAfter graduation from Cornell in 1903, Purcell returned to Oak Park, Illinois. Purcell considered applying to Frank Lloyd Wright for a position in his architectural practice. Instead, Purcell took a clerking position with Ezra E. Roberts, a stable and prosperous architect of whom Charles A. Purcell thought well. During a dinner party in Oak Park, Purcell met George Grant Elmslie, then the chief draftsman for Louis Sullivan. The two men liked one another immediately, not least because of their shared interest in progressive architecture. When Purcell complained of his situation with Roberts, Elmslie offered to secure Purcell a position in the Sullivan office. However, there was not a great deal of work to be done in the office. Purcell spent five months there, from August to December 1903.\n\nIn 1904, Purcell ventured to the West Coast by way of an extended journey through the southwestern United States. He eventually arrived at Los Angeles and applied for work at the office of Myron Hunt, but there was no opening. On the recommendation of those with whom he interviewed, Purcell left southern California for San Francisco. Hired by John Galen Howard, Purcell became clerk of the works for the construction of California Hall, being built on the University of California campus at Berkeley. In 1905 Purcell moved farther up the coast to Seattle, Washington, where he worked for several months in the office of A. Warren Gould.\n\nPurcell's father, who was afraid of the effects of the region's weather on the health of his son, offered to send him on a year-long tour of Europe. Accepting the offer, Purcell contacted his former classmate, George Feick, Jr., and two men agreed to meet in New York. In April, 1906 Purcell and Feick were greeted upon their landing at Naples, Italy, by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. After visiting Florence and Venice, they traveled across Greece to Constantinople and by June had returned to western Europe. Purcell was keen to seek out the best contemporary design and, remembering a suggestion made by Elmslie he stopped in Holland to visit the architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage. Berlage received him warmly and the two established a long-lasting friendship. Purcell was also successful in his efforts to reach Scandinavia, where he met progressive architects Ferdinand Boberg and M. Nyrop. These contacts added to his growing desire to commence his own work and shortly after returning to the United States, Purcell moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to open an office in partnership with George Feick, Jr.\n\nThe architectural practice most widely known as Purcell & Elmslie consisted of three partnerships. The first, Purcell & Feick, was formed in 1907. George Elmslie was an informal influence in the work of Purcell & Feick. During the last months of 1909 Louis Sullivan could no longer pay George Elmslie because of declining business fortunes, and Elmslie was forced to find a more reliable situation. By 1910 Elmslie had left the Sullivan office and moved to Minneapolis as a full partner in Purcell, Feick & Elmslie.\n\nGeorge Elmslie brought important business contacts that resulted in a growing number of commissions from former Sullivan clients. George Feick followed leads for projects in his hometown and handled small buildings for friends and acquaintances. Purcell continued to develop productive friendships with men who lived in small towns throughout the Midwest, which created a network of sympathizers who kept the firm advised of potential jobs. Over the course of the partnership, Purcell & Elmslie became one of the most commissioned firms among the Prairie School architects, second only to Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nDuring these years of success, personal events brought substantial changes to the lives of both Purcell and Elmslie. Profoundly affected by the death of his wife in 1912, Elmslie left Minneapolis in March 1913 and returned to Chicago where he opened a second Purcell, Feick & Elmslie office. George Feick did not completely share the intense dedication of Purcell and Elmslie to the new architecture, and in 1913 left Minneapolis to rejoin his father's business in Sandusky, Ohio. After the Woodbury County Courthouse was completed in 1918, the business of the firm entered a decline. Purcell requested the dissolution of the Purcell & Elmslie partnership in 1921.\n\nPurcell moved to Portland, Oregon in November 1919 to join his cousin, Charles H. Purcell, in a bridge building company called the Pacific States Engineering Corporation (PSEC). After the dissolution of the firm of Purcell & Elmslie, Purcell marketed standardized plans through a variety of service firm names. The Pacific States Engineering Corporation (PSEC) houses were a mainstay of Purcell's architectural practice during the 1920s. Purcell also became involved with the Architect's Small House Service Bureau (ASHSB,) and associated himself with other area architects in numerous residential designs in and around the Portland area. He also became increasingly active in professional, civic, and arts organizations.\n\nIn 1925 Purcell met James Van Evera Bailey, a young architect who was an integral participant in both the design and construction process for four houses built during the Portland years. The largest and final major commission that Purcell received was the Third Church of Christ Scientist, in Portland, completed in 1926.\n\nThroughout the decade, Purcell had felt a progressive decline in his physical well being and, finally seeking medical attention in 1930, was diagnosed as having advanced tuberculosis. He closed his architectural practice and moved to a sanatorium in Banning, California. Following successful lung surgery, Purcell retired to an estate in the foothills of Southern California, near Pasadena. He continued to develop and support the cause of American architecture for another thirty years, mostly through publishing many essays, consulting with architectural historians, and other writings.\n\nPurcell turned to writing and began an articulation of his views on art and architecture that continued prolifically until his death. Two projects were of special importance to him. From the late 1930s to the mid 1950s, he developed a series of unpublished essays called \"The Parabiographies\" that were commission-by-commission accounts of experiences during his architectural practice. These pages, together with many manuscripts discussing Sullivan and the \"function and form\" thesis, were sent for reading to George Elmslie who often added his own annotations. From 1940 to 1955, Purcell was principal contributing editor to an architectural journal, \"Northwest Architect\", to which he contributed more than sixty articles.\n\nDuring 1962-1963, Purcell had an architectural apprentice who would go on to become a significant American organic architect, Arthur Dyson. Dyson spent nearly a year in the Taliesin Fellowship prior to the death of Frank Lloyd Wright in 1959, before going to work for notable organic architect Bruce Goff, who gave Dyson a copy of a catalog from an exhibition about Purcell and Elmslie that took place in Minneapolis. Dyson sought out Purcell as a mentor. The two men spent their time together reviewing the records of Purcell and Elmslie and discussing the nature of architectural design.\n\nAfter his death on April 11, 1965, he was buried in the Forest Home Cemetery, Forest Park, Illinois.\n\nThere are two houses built by William Gray Purcell for his personal residence in Minneapolis. The second was built in 1913 and called \"Lake Place\" by the Purcell family. Known now as the Edna S. Purcell House, the house is maintained by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nHis \"Maryhill\" in Edina, Minnesota, is interesting because of the documentation of how it was created. It was designed by Purcell in correspondence with the future owners, Paul and Mary Carson, and the 600 pieces of their correspondence are in the University of Minnesota's Architectural Archives.\n\nNot all of Purcell's work fits in the \"Prairie School\" category. Several of his houses in Portland's West Hills show how he adapted his ideas to fit a more urban setting. A feature shared by one of those houses and Maryhill is a sleeping loft, but the Portland example also features a wooden carving of Nils on his goose flying out over the living room.\n\nIn the 1920s, Purcell moved to the Pacific Northwest where he designed a number of \"cotswald\" style homes.\n\nIn 1922, Purcell designed the Louis and Elizabeth Woerner House in the Alameda District of Portland's Eastside. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2004.\n\nIn the 1930s Purcell moved to Pasadena, California. In Pasadena, Purcell first built Moderne work. His only known surviving Moderne building is his own vacation home in Palm Springs. Purcell after WW2 seems to have fully embraced modernism and some five homes designed by him from 1945-1965 survive in Pasadena in various levels of modification.\n\nThe William Gary Purcell papers were donated by the estate to the Northwest Architectural Archives 1965. The collection contains drawings, including plans, elevations and sections, for much of the firm's work, together with renderings, sketches, photographs and correspondence. Letters, photographs and books from Purcell's maternal grandfather (William Cunningham Gray, 1830-1901) form part of the collection. Also present in the papers are manuscripts, typescripts, and clippings.\n\nPurcell was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1963.\n\nPurcell is the author of the 1967 book, \"St. Croix Trail Country: Recollections of Wisconsin,\" a memoir of his youth spent in the Wisconsin lake country.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796242", "title": "Rationalization (sociology)", "text": "Rationalization (sociology)\n\nIn sociology, rationalization (or rationalisation) is the replacement of traditions, values, and emotions as motivators for behavior in society with concepts based on rationality and reason. For example, the implementation of bureaucracies in government is a kind of rationalization, as is the construction of high-efficiency living spaces in architecture and urban planning. A potential reason as to why rationalization of a culture may take place in the modern era is the process of globalization. Countries are becoming increasingly interlinked, and with the rise of technology, it is easier for countries to influence each other through social networking, the media and politics. An example of rationalization in place would be the case of witch doctors in certain parts of Africa. Whilst many locals view them as an important part of their culture and traditions, development initiatives and aid workers have tried to rationalize the practice in order to educate the local people in modern medicine and practice (Giddens, 2013).\n\nMany sociologists, critical theorists and contemporary philosophers have argued that rationalization, falsely assumed as progress, has had a negative and dehumanizing effect on society, moving modernity away from the central tenets of Enlightenment. The founders of sociology had critical reaction to rationalization:\n\nRationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed – by contrast with anthropology – on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German antipositivist Max Weber, though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of dialectism and sociocultural evolution informs the concept.\n\nWeber demonstrated rationalization in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", in which the aims of certain Protestant Theologies, particularly Calvinism, are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.\n\nWeber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. In charismatic authority, the death of a leader effectively ends the power of that authority, and only through a rationalized and bureaucratic base can this authority be passed on. Traditional authorities in rationalized societies also tend to develop a rational-legal base to better ensure a stable accession. (See also: Tripartite classification of authority)\n\nWhereas in traditional societies such as feudalism governing is managed under the traditional leadership of, for example, a queen or tribal chief, modern societies operate under rational-legal systems. For example, democratic systems attempt to remedy qualitative concerns (such as racial discrimination) with rationalized, quantitative means (for example, civil rights legislation). Weber described the eventual effects of rationalization in his \"Economy and Society\" as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in an \"iron cage\" (or \"steel-hard casing\") of rule-based, rational control.\n\nJürgen Habermas has argued that understanding rationalization properly requires going beyond Weber's notion of rationalization. It requires distinguishing between \"instrumental rationality\", which involves calculation and efficiency (in other words, reducing all relationships to those of means and ends), and \"communicative rationality\", which involves expanding the scope of mutual understanding in communication, the ability to expand this understanding through reflective discourse about communication, and making social and political life subject to this expanded understanding.\n\nFor Zygmunt Bauman, rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be closely associated with the events of the Holocaust. In \"Modernity and Ambivalence\", Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar.\n\nYet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, \"Modernity and the Holocaust\", is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno's books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.\n\nFor this reason, Bauman argues that modern societies have not fully taken on board the lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' \"par excellence\" in Europe; the Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.\n\nIn their analysis of contemporary western society, \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1944, revised 1947), Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer developed a wide and pessimistic concept of enlightenment. In their analysis, enlightenment had its dark side: while trying to abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of reason. In their view, the enlightenment itself should be enlightened and not posed as a 'myth-free' view of the world. For Marxist philosophy in general, rationalization is closely associated with the concept of \"commodity fetishism\", for the reason that not only are products designed to fulfill certain tasks, but employees are hired to fulfill specific tasks as well.\n\nModern food consumption typifies the process of rationalization. Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. Fast-food restaurants, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals and the addition of drive-through windows.\n\nRationalization is also observable in the replacement of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case of Wal-Mart is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted considerable criticism for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations, due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.\n\nThe sociologist George Ritzer has used the term McDonaldization to refer, not just to the actions of the fast food restaurant, but to the general process of rationalization. Ritzer distinguishes four primary components of McDonaldization:\n\n\nAs capitalism itself is a rationalized economic policy, so is the process of commercialization it utilizes in order to increase sales. Most holidays, for instance, were created out of a religious context or in celebration of some past event. However, in rationalized societies these traditional values are increasingly diminished and the aim shifts from the qualitative aim of a meaningful celebration to the more quantitative aim of increasing sales.\n\nIn the United States, for example, most major holidays now are represented by rationalized, secularized figures which serve as a corporate totem. In more traditional environments, gifts are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present they are interested in receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift is more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).\n\nOne rational tendency is towards increasing the efficiency and output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular exercise, dieting, increased hygiene, drugs, and an emphasis on optimal nutrition. As well as increasing lifespans, these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks. Another aspect of this is maintaining a certain level of physical attraction. Processes such as the combing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate haircut, and wearing certain clothes receive calculated use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals. In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.\n\nAnother trend is in the bureaucratization of processes that formerly might have been done through the home. This includes the use of hospitals for childbirth and the use of doctors to identify symptoms of an illness and to prescribe treatment.\n\nRationalized education tends to focus less on subjects based around the use of critical discourse (for instance, religion) and more on matters of a calculated importance (such as business administration). This is reflected also in the move towards standardized and multiple choice testing, which measures students on the basis of numbered answers and against a uniform standard.\n\n\n\n"}

This contact between the Soviets, advancing from the East, and the Americans, advancing from the West, meant that the two powers had effectively cut Germany in two.\n\nElbe Day has never been an official holiday in any country, but in the years after 1945 the memory of this friendly encounter gained new significance in the context of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe first contact between American and Soviet patrols occurred near Strehla, after First Lieutenant Albert Kotzebue, an American soldier, crossed the River Elbe in a boat with three men of an intelligence and reconnaissance platoon. On the east bank they met forward elements of a Soviet Guards rifle regiment of the First Ukrainian Front, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gordeyev. The same day, another patrol under Second Lieutenant William Robertson with Frank Huff, James McDonnell and Paul Staub met a Soviet patrol commanded by Lieutenant Alexander Silvashko on the destroyed Elbe bridge of Torgau.\n\nOn April 26, the commander of the 69th Infantry Division of the First Army, Emil F. Reinhardt, and the commander of the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army, Vladimir Rusakov, met at Torgau, southwest of Berlin. Arrangements were made for the formal \"Handshake of Torgau\" between Robertson and Silvashko in front of photographers the following day, April 27.\n\nThe Soviet, American, and British governments released simultaneous statements that evening in London, Moscow, and Washington, reaffirming the determination of the three Allied powers to complete the destruction of the Third Reich.\n\nMonuments at Torgau, Lorenzkirch, and Bad Liebenwerda commemorate the first encounters between U.S. and Soviet troops on Elbe Day. In the United States, a \"Spirit of the Elbe\" plaque at Arlington National Cemetery commemorates the day.\n\nIn 1949 the Soviet film studio Mosfilm commemorated Elbe Day in the black-and-white film \"Encounter at the Elbe\".\n\nDuring the Cold War the meeting of the two armies was often recalled as a symbol of peace and friendship between the people of the two antagonistic superpowers. For example, in 1961 the popular Russian song \"Do the Russians Want War?\" evoked the memory of American and Soviet soldiers embracing at the Elbe River.\n\nJoseph Polowsky, an American soldier who met Soviet troops on Elbe Day, was deeply affected by the experience and devoted much of his life to opposing war. He commemorated Elbe Day each year in his hometown of Chicago and unsuccessfully petitioned the United Nations to make April 25 a \"World Day of Peace.\" His remains are buried in a cemetery in Torgau.\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Fred Small commemorated Joseph Polowsky and Elbe Day in his song \"At The Elbe\".\n\nIn 1988 a plaque titled \"\"Der Geist der Elbe\"\" (\"Spirit of the Elbe\") was mounted on a stone near Torgau at the site of the encounter between troops of the U.S. 69th Infantry and the Soviet Guards.\n\nIn 1995 the Russian Federation issued a three-ruble coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of Elbe Day.\n\nBy 2010, the 65th anniversary of the event, Elbe Day events in Torgau were held annually on the weekend closest to April 25, attracting tourists to the city. Also in 2010, the U.S. and Russian presidents for the first time issued a joint statement on April 25 commemorating Elbe Day and the \"spirit of the Elbe\".\n\nThe meeting at the Elbe is represented in the war strategy game \"R.U.S.E.\", released in 2010 and 2011 and based loosely on World War II events.\n\n\n"}

He began his career with Manchester United and was one of the \"Busby Babes\" who survived the Munich air disaster of 1958. Although he sustained severe injuries, he recovered and continued to play league football for Newcastle United, Lincoln City and Mansfield Town. He then went on to play non-league football until his retirement.\n\nBorn in Hulme, Manchester, Scanlon was a nephew of former Manchester United winger Charlie Mitten. He attended St Wilfred's School in Hulme. His talent for football was noticed early on, and he was selected to play for the Manchester Boys side. He joined the Manchester United groundstaff in 1950, before signing a professional contract in December 1952.\n\nScanlon made his way through the Manchester United youth system, winning two FA Youth Cups in 1953 and 1954 before making his first-team debut against Arsenal on 20 November 1954. Scanlon was involved in two league title wins – in 1956 and 1957 – but he failed to make enough appearances to earn a winners' medal on either occasion, with David Pegg being United's regular left winger during this time. Scanlon was occasionally used as a right winger, which was the regular position of Johnny Berry.\n\nOn 5 February 1958, Scanlon started on the left wing in United's European Cup quarter-final second leg away to Red Star Belgrade; for five of the players who started the game, it was to be their last ever match for the club. The next day, on the return journey to Manchester, the team's plane crashed while attempting to take off from Munich airport, in an incident that later became known as the Munich air disaster. The crash claimed the lives of 23 of the plane's 44 passengers and crew, so Scanlon was relatively fortunate to escape with just a fractured skull, a broken leg and kidney damage. His injuries put him out of action for the rest of the season.\n\nHe made a full recovery and was back in action at the start of the following season, going on to appear in every game that season, scoring 16 goals in the process.\n\nScanlon was sold to Newcastle United for £18,000 in November 1960, but his time on Tyneside was not a success and he then dropped down to a lower level to play for Lincoln City in February 1962. He was on the move again just over a year later, joining Mansfield Town in April 1963, just in time to participate in the club's celebrations at being promoted to the Third Division. Mansfield narrowly missed out on promotion to the Second Division two years later, finishing third in Division Three, but they dropped to 19th the following season and Scanlon took the opportunity to drop out of league football. He joined Belper Town in 1966, and retired not long afterwards.\n\nAfter he retired from football, Scanlon returned to the Manchester area and worked in a succession of jobs outside football, including working as a security guard at a Colgate-Palmolive factory near Old Trafford, and being a docker in Salford.\n\nIn 2006, he complained about inaccuracies in a recent BBC documentary about the Munich air disaster :: see Munich air disaster#Dramatisations.\n\nOn 13 May 2007, Scanlon presented the Premier League trophy to Manchester United along with former teammate Bill Foulkes.\n\nHe attended United's victorious European Cup final appearance in May 2008 in Moscow, being flown to the game in Russia on a private jet hired by United along with fellow Munich survivors Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Gregg. Bill Foulkes, the other remaining survivor, attended the game as well.\n\nScanlon was admitted to the Salford Royal hospital in the Hope area of Pendleton, Salford with kidney problems and pneumonia on 21 October 2009. He was in intensive care for more than a month, before dying on 22 December 2009, at the age of 74. His funeral was held on 13 January 2010, and more than 300 people attended the service at All Souls' Church in Weaste, including fellow Munich survivors Bobby Charlton, Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes, and former Manchester United players Denis Law and Nobby Stiles.\n\n"}

He graduated from Manchester United's youth system and played for the club on 117 occasions, winning two league titles, before his career was cut short due to injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster. He was also capped 12 times at senior level by Northern Ireland.\n\nHe was the younger brother of Danny Blanchflower, the captain of the Tottenham Hotspur side that dominated English football in the early 1960s.\n\nBlanchflower's first appearance in a professional game was for Manchester United on 24 November 1951 against Liverpool, away at Anfield. He became a regular first team player in the 1953–54 season, when he played in 27 out of 42 league games and scored 13 goals as an inside-forward.\n\nHe helped the club win the league title in 1956 and again in 1957. Nicknamed \"Twiggy\" by his teammates, he was renowned for his versatility. He began his career as a left-half before the emergence of Duncan Edwards in this position, when he switched to the forward positions, but the Manchester United manager Matt Busby recognised his intelligent positioning sense and aerial power and chose to play him at centre-half by the 1955–56 season, with John Doherty and Billy Whelan now competing for his former position, although he faced fierce competition for the solitary centre-half place due to the presence of Mark Jones. He covered in goal in the 1957 FA Cup Final while Ray Wood received treatment for an injury suffered in a collision with Peter McParland, who scored both of Aston Villa's goals as United lost 2–1. Blanchflower also played in some of United's first European Cup fixtures.\n\nHe scored 27 goals during his time at the club, most of them during his time as a forward.\n\nOn 6 February 1958, the Manchester United team that had travelled to Belgrade for the second leg of a European cup tie had their chartered plane stop in Munich to refuel. Weather conditions caused the plane to crash when the pilot attempted to take-off from Munich airport and 23 of the 44 people on board were killed. Blanchflower was severely injured, suffering from a fractured pelvis and arms and legs, and crushed kidneys, and his right arm was nearly severed. He was in hospital for two months and was read the last rites in the early days (despite his Protestant upbringing), but survived.\n\nHe tried to return to football, but never made a full recovery. Doctors advised him not to return to football because of fears he would damage his kidney and, a year later, Blanchflower retired from football. The Munich air disaster meant that he had played his last game of football when still only 24 years old, having earned 12 caps for Northern Ireland, played well over 100 times for Manchester United and won two league championship medals.\n\nThe callous attitude of Manchester United towards Blanchflower after injury forced the end of his playing career was revealed by journalist David Conn in a 2000 article in \"The Independent\": \nHe and Jean were married in 1956.\n\nHe eventually pursued studies in finance and began a career as an accountant. He later became an after-dinner speaker and was a regular on the after-dinner circuits until his death from cancer on 2 September 1998. He was 65 years old, and just two weeks before he died he had attended the Munich air disaster testimonial match at Old Trafford.\n\nHe was survived by his three children; Krista, Senior (born 1958), Laurie (born 1961) and Andrew (born 1963), as well as his wife Jean, who died in 2002 after a long illness.\n\nHe outlived his older brother Danny, who died in December 1993.\n"}

He became an active participant in the Gilman Street Project and was a founding member of Crimpshrine, a highly influential East Bay punk rock band which also featured Jeff Ott. In a September 2016 interview Cometbus described how his personal life is not necessarily reflected in his zines stating, \"Growing up, I was just really, really restless. I felt cooped up. Every band interview I did was about being on the road. When I finally got to cut loose, I went on three tours in two years, then had the band drop me off in the first city where I could find a room. So I’d made it out, but then came the news: my mom had cancer. I spent the next fifteen years going back and forth—caretaking first her and then my dad when they were doing badly, and when they were in remission, I’d get as far away as I could. When both were dead, I moved to New York, where I’ve lived ever since. That’s my life, in a nutshell. Which answers your earlier question about how much the fanzine reflected my personal life. Not so much.\" \n\nAfter the demise of Crimpshrine, Cometbus formed Pinhead Gunpowder with a handful of people from the East Bay punk scene, including Sarah Kirsch (later replaced by Jason White), Bill Schneider and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. He toured as a roadie with Green Day for many years and played drums for a few shows after the departure of John Kiffmeyer, he was replaced by another temporary drummer Dave \"E.C.\" Henwood and before Tre Cool joined. He has played in a multitude of short-lived bands that generally release just a seven-inch or two before breaking up (see Band history). He is a co-owner of a used bookstore in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, called Book Thug Nation and a used bookstore in Bushwick called \"Human Relations\"\n\nCometbus is most famous for publishing the zine \"Cometbus\", which he began in Berkeley, California in 1981. Cometbus has self-published the usually-handwritten zine ever since, despite a few breaks. The name \"Cometbus\" was coined by Gregg Turkington during the early days of the magazine when the name changed from issue to issue. \"Cometbus\" consisted of band interviews, personal diaries, artwork, and observations on the punk subculture in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. The zine captured a slice of life in Oakland and Berkeley from the late 1980s through the 1990s.\n\nFrom 2004-06, Cometbus took a hiatus from writing \"Cometbus\" to pursue publishing his writing through other channels. \"Cometbus\" came out of retirement in 2006 with the release of \"Cometbus #50\", the 25th anniversary issue of the magazine. Originally planned as a letters only issue, it features band interviews (for the first time since issue #24), short stories, and book store reviews.\n\n\"Cometbus #51, The Loneliness of the Electric Menorah\", was released in September 2008. It chronicles the history of Moe's Books and other longtime businesses on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California.\n\n\"Cometbus #52, The Spirit of St-Louis, Or, How to Break Your Own Heart, A Tragedy in 24 Parts\", was released in 2009. Cometbus says in his blurb: \"It all starts with the story I've told so many times it's turned stale and tired from overuse. There I was, dropped off in a city far from home.

As soon as he was born he was given weapons and horses, as was the custom of the time.\n\nWhen Hlöd heard that his father Heidrek was dead and that his half-brother Angantyr had been proclaimed king of the Goths, his grandfather Humli said that Hlod had to go to Arheimar and demand his rightful inheritance.\n\nHlöd arrived to Arheimar with many Hunnish warriors. He found a man outside of the hall and asked him to go inside and tell Angantyr that his brother wished to see him.\n\nWhen King Angantyr learnt of who was waiting outside for him, he cast down his knife, took his mailcoat, his white shield in one hand and Tyrfing in the other. Then he asked Hlöd to come in and drink with them in honour of their dead father.\n\nHowever, Hlöd answered that he had not come to feast, he wanted half of everything that Angantyr had inherited from their father: cow and calf, handmills, tools and weapons, treasures, slaves, bondmaids, sons and daughters, Myrkviðr, the grave, the carved stone beside Dniepr, Heidrek's armour, lands, liegemen and rings.\n\nAngantyr refused to share with Hlöd and said that he had no right to inherit, but in recompense Hlöd would get lances, wealth, cattle, a thousand thralls, a thousand horses and a thousand armoured bondsmen. Before leaving all of them would receive riches and a maid.\n\nHlöd would get his measure in silver and gold, and he would be given a whole third of the land of the Goths to rule.\n\nHowever, Gizur Grytingalidi, the aged king of the Geats, who was visiting in order to bid farewell to his dead foster-son Heidrek, thought that Angantyr was too generous. Gizur stated that Hlöd was only a bastard and the son of a slave-girl, and should not receive so princely a gift.\n\nOffended by being called a bastard and a slave-girl's son, Hlöd returned to the Huns and to Humli. He told Humli that Angantyr had refused to share the kingdom with him, and when Humli insisted he also said that he had been called the son of a slave.\n\nHumli decided that they muster all the might of the Huns and attack the Goths. As soon as spring arrived they gathered an army so vast, that the steppes were depleted of men of fighting age. Every man who could carry arms down to twelve-year-olds, and every horse from two years of age and older. All in all the Huns mustered a horde of 343,200 mounted warriors.\n\nWhen the horde was gathered they rode through Myrkviðr which separated Reidgotaland from the land of the Huns. As the horde came out of the forest they arrived at a populous country of flat plains. On the plains there was a fortress with a strong garrison commanded by Hervor, the sister of Angantyr and Hlöd, together with Ormar, her foster-father.\n\nOne morning as the sun was rising above the steppes, Hervor stood on a watchtower and saw a great cloudstorm rising southwards over the forest. It hid the sun for a long time. Suddenly, she saw under the cloud a mass of gold. There were gilded helmets, shields and corselets and she realized that it was the horde which had arrived.\n\nHervor asked the trumpeter to blow a summons to gather the forces. Then she told Ormar to ride and meet the Huns and challenge them to do battle in front of the southern gate. Ormar rode to the Goths and told them that they would do battle outside the southern gate.\n\nOutside that gate, there was a mighty battle, and since the horde was much larger, the Goths fell and finally Hervor was slain. When Ormar saw her die he retreated together with all those who were faint of heart. He rode day and night to reach king Angantyr in Arheimar.\n\nAs the Huns pillaged and burnt far and wide in Reidgotaland, Ormar arrived at Arheimar and related that the marches were burning at the hands of the Huns and that his sister was dead. Angantyr's lips were drawn back and said that his brother had not treated Hervor like a sister, and then he watched his small company and stated that the more men one needs the less one has. Gizur, the aged King of the Geats, said that he would fight for Angantyr and he would ask for no recompense.\n\nHeidrek had instated a law that if an army invaded a land and the king of that country marked a field with hazel poles, the marauding army would stop pillaging until there had been battle inside the poles.\n\nThe old Gizur armed himself with good weapons and leapt on his horse like a young man. Then he asked where Angantyr desired to meet the Huns. Angantyr answered that he wished to meet them on the plains of the Danube below the Hills of Ash, where the Goths had oft been victorious.\n\nGizur rode so close to the Huns that they could hear him and shouted that Odin was angry with them and that they were doomed.\n\nHlod cried that they should seize Gizur, but Humli said that lone heralds must not be hurt.\n\nGizur called out that the Goths were afraid of neither the Huns nor their bows, and then he hastened to Angantyr to report about the size of the horde.\n\nAngantyr sent messengers to every part of the land to summon every able-bodied man. He then marched to the Danube with his great army and met the great army of the Huns.\n\nThey fought for eight days. No one could count the fallen but still no captains had been slain. Day and night the armies clashed around Angantyr, and the fight grew more and more bitter. The Huns became more and more ferocious as they knew that they would not survive a defeat. The Goths, on the other hand, were fighting for their freedom and for the land where they were born.\n\nWhen the eighth day ended, the Goths pushed forward breaking the Hunnic lines. The Huns lost their courage as they saw Angantyr ride through the lines slashing and cutting men and horses with Tyrfing. Angantyr and Hlod met and Hlod fell, as well as Humli.\n\nThe Huns fled but the Goths pursued them and filled the rivers with bodies so that they choked and this caused a flood which filled the valleys with dead men and horses.\n\nAngantyr searched among the slain and finally found his brother. He stated that cruel is the doom of the Norns when brother slays brother.\n"}

There are many disadvantages that collectively work in a circular process making it virtually impossible for individuals to break the cycle. This occurs when poor people do not have the resources necessary to get out of poverty, such as financial capital, education, or connections. In other words, impoverished individuals do not have access to economic and social resources as a result of their poverty. This lack may increase their poverty. This could mean that the poor remain poor throughout their lives. \n\nThe poverty cycle can be called the \"development trap\" or \"poverty trap\" when it is applied to countries.\n\nRuby K. Payne, author of \"A Framework for Understanding Poverty\", distinguishes between situational poverty, which can generally be traced to a specific incident within the lifetimes of the person or family members in poverty, and generational poverty, which is a cycle that passes from generation to generation, and goes on to argue that generational poverty has its own distinct culture and belief patterns.\n\nMeasures of social mobility examine how frequently poor people become wealthier, and how often children are wealthier or achieve higher income than their parents.\n\nPoverty can be created or sustained for large numbers of people through general economic conditions, which tend to be self-sustaining. Metrics for these conditions include:\nThere are also various poverty metrics that directly indicate its extent, generally involving income, wealth, or both. It can be measured on an absolute scale (which might put almost an entire country's population below the poverty line) or in a relative way, identifying people who are poor compared to others in the same country.\n\nCountries with chronically low levels of economic development fail to provide opportunities for many individuals to leave poverty. These may be caused by:\n\nGenerally poor economic conditions can also be due to temporary causes, which might not result in a \"cycle of poverty\" if the economy recovers thereafter. Temporary economic problems can be caused by:\n\nA one-time event, whether affecting the economy in general or personal in nature, can push a given person or family into poverty, after which they enter the \"cycle of poverty\" which is difficult to escape. Examples of personal events that can have a negative economic impact include:\n\nOnce poor, people can experience difficulty escaping poverty because many things that would allow them to do so require money they don't have, such as:\n\nAccording to the United States Census, in 2012 people aged 18-64 living in poverty in the country gave the reason they did not work, by category:\n\nSome activities can also cost poor people more than wealthier people:\n\nGovernment policy, government funding, and access to financial services can play a large role in preventing one-time events from pushing people into poverty, and in overcoming barriers to escaping poverty. People who cannot work due to a disability often rely on government assistance, family members, or charities, but may also have personal savings. Many governments have programs to support the elderly, given that many have not saved enough money to last throughout their planned retirement, and that many will experience health problems that prevent them from working. Inability to work can present an insurmountable barrier to exiting poverty if external assistance is insufficient.\n\nAmongst the most popular characterizations of the ongoing experience of poverty are that (1) it is systemic or institutionalized or (2) a person is misguided by emotional challenges driven by historical experiences or (3) a person is affected by a mental disability, or a combination of all three reasons (Bertrand, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2004).\n\nDonald Curtis (2006), a researcher at the School of Public Policy in the United Kingdom, identified that governments regard the welfare system as an enabling task. Curtis (2006) maintained, however, that the system lacks cohesiveness, and is not designed to be an empowerment tool. \n\nFor example, outside parties are funded to manage the effort without much oversight creating a disconnected system, for which no one leads (Curtis, 2006). The result is mismanagement of budget without forwarding progress, and those that remain in the poverty loophole are accused of draining the system (Curtis, 2006).\n\nJill Suttie (2018), wrote that implicit bias, which can be transferred nonverbally to children with no more than a look or a gesture, and as such is a learned behavior. Critical thinking skills can ward off implicit bias, but without education and practice, habitual thoughts can cloud judgment and poorly affect future decisions.\n\nA Dartmouth College (2016) study reported that probabilistic decision-making follows prior-based knowledge of failure in similar situations. Rather than choose success, people respond as if the failure has already taken place. Those that have experienced intergenerational poverty are most susceptible to this kind of learned behavior (Wagmiller & Adelman, 2009). \n\nProfessors of Sociology Wagmiller and Adelman (2009) asserted that roughly 35–46% of people who have experienced hardship in young and middle adulthood also experienced moderate to severe poverty in poverty in childhood. As of 2018, 7.5 million people experienced poverty in California alone (Downs, 2018). \n\nIn a qualitative study, Rudnick et al., (2014), studied people living in poverty with mental illness and determined that participants felt that wellness care, nutrition, housing, and jobs were severely lacking. Respondents asserted that the most significant problem was access to quality services; bureaucratic systems appear to be devoid of logic and treatment by providers were often unaccommodating and uncooperative (Rudnick et al., 2014).\n\nThe thread of these examples is a general lack of critical thinking employed by those designing systems, providing care, or experiencing setbacks. Perhaps, future systems can include leadership with an emphasis on critical thinking. Government agencies can work towards accountability of design and cohesiveness and between agencies. Training for healthcare providers can consist of ways to identify and eliminate bias. Counseling can be of help for those experiencing poverty to reverse negative thought patterns brought on by a repetitive pattern of negative probabilistic thinking.\n\nPersonal choices and cultural influences can also make it difficult to escape poverty, such as:\n\nDiscrimination can make it more difficult to access government programs, to find work, and to access resources and social networks that could help. For a variety of reasons, it is more difficult to escape poverty in areas of concentrated poverty, where poor people may be forced to live by economic circumstance. Racial segregation can represent a combination of both discrimination and concentration.\n\nGenerational poverty is poverty that is inherited across generations. This can happen because:\n\n\nA 2002 research paper titled \"The Changing Effect of Family Background on the Incomes of American Adults\" analyzed changes in the determinants of family income between 1961 and 1999,\nfocusing on the effect of parental education, occupational rank, income, marital status, family size, region of residence, race, and ethnicity. The paper (1) outlines a simple framework for thinking about how family background affects children's family and income, (2) summarizes previous research on trends in intergenerational inheritance in the United States, (3) describes the data used as a basis for the research which it describes, (4) discusses trends in inequality among parents, (5) describes how the effects of parental inequality changed between 1961 and 1999, (6) contrasts effects at the top and bottom of the distribution, and (7) discusses whether intergenerational correlations of zero would be desirable. The paper concludes by posing the question of whether reducing the intergenerational correlation is an efficient strategy for reducing poverty or inequality.\n\nBecause improving the skills of disadvantaged children seems relatively easy, it is an attractive strategy. However, judging by American experience since the 1960s, improving the skills of disadvantaged children has proved difficult. As a result, the paper suggests, there are probably cheaper and easier ways to reduce poverty and inequality, such as supplementing the wages of the poor or changing immigration policy so that it drives down the relative wages of skilled rather than unskilled workers. These alternative strategies would not reduce intergenerational correlations, but they would reduce the economic gap between children who started life with all the disadvantages instead of all the advantages.\n\nAnother paper, titled \"Do poor children become poor adults?\", which was originally presented at a 2004 symposium on the future of children from disadvantaged families in France, and was later included in a 2006 collection of papers related to the theme of the dynamics of inequality and poverty, discusses generational income mobility in North America and Europe. The paper opens by observing that in the United States almost one half of children born to low income parents become low income adults, four in ten in the United Kingdom, and one-third in Canada. The paper goes on to observe that rich children also tend to become rich adults—four in ten in the U.S. and the U.K., and as many as one-third in Canada. The paper argues, however, that money is not the only or even the most important factor influencing intergenerational income mobility. The rewards to higher skilled and/or higher educated individuals in the labor market and the opportunities for children to obtain the required skills and credentials are two important factors. Reaching the conclusion that income transfers to lower income individuals may be important to children in the here and now, but they should not be counted on to strongly promote generational mobility. The paper recommends that governments focus on investments in children to ensure that they have the skills and opportunities to succeed in the labor market, and observes that though this has historically meant promoting access to higher and higher levels of education, it is becoming increasingly important that attention be paid to preschool and early childhood education.\n\nSociologist William Julius Wilson has said that the economic restructuring of changes from manufacturing to a service-based economy has led to a high percentage of joblessness in the inner-cities and with it a loss of skills and inability to find jobs. This \"mismatch\" of skills to jobs available is said to be the main driver of poverty.\n\nResearch shows that schools with students that perform lower than the norm are also those hiring least-qualified teachers as a result of new teachers generally working in the area that they grew up in. This leads to certain schools not producing many students that go on to college. Students from these schools that go on to be college graduates are not as skilled as they would be if they had gone to a school with higher-qualified instructors. This leads to education perpetuating a cycle of poverty. People that choose to work in the schools close to them do not adequately supply the school with enough teachers. The schools must then outsource their teachers from other areas. Susanna Loeb from the School of Education at Stanford did a study and found that teachers who are brought in from the suburbs are 10 times more likely to transfer out of the school after their initial year. The fact that the teachers from the suburbs leave appears to be an influential factor for schools hiring more teachers from that area. The lack of adequate education for children is part of what allows for the cycle of poverty to continue. The problem undergoing this is the lack of updating the knowledge of the staff. Schools have continued to conduct professional development the same way they have for decades.\n\nAnother theory for the perpetual cycle of poverty is that poor people have their own culture with a different set of values and beliefs that keep them trapped within that cycle generation to generation. This theory has been explored by Ruby K. Payne in her book \"A Framework for Understanding Poverty\". In this book she explains how a social class system in the United States exists, where there is a wealthy upper class, a middle class, and the working poor class. These classes each have their own set of rules and values, which differ from each other. To understand the culture of poverty, Payne describes how these rules affect the poor and tend to keep them trapped in this continual cycle. Time is treated differently by the poor; they generally do not plan ahead but simply live in the moment, which keeps them from saving money that could help their children escape poverty.\n\nPayne emphasizes how important it is when working with the poor to understand their unique cultural differences so that one does not get frustrated but instead tries to work with them on their ideologies and help them to understand how they can help themselves and their children escape the cycle. One aspect of generational poverty is a learned helplessness that is passed from parents to children, a mentality that there is no way for one to get out of poverty and so in order to make the best of the situation one must enjoy what one can when one can. This leads to such habits as spending money immediately, often on unnecessary goods such as alcohol and cigarettes, thus teaching their children to do the same and trapping them in poverty. Another important point Payne makes is that leaving poverty is not as simple as acquiring money and moving into a higher class but also includes giving up certain relationships in exchange for achievement. A student's peers can have an influence on the child's level of achievement. Coming from a low-income household a child could be teased or expected to fall short academically. This can cause a student to feel discouraged and hold back when it comes to getting involved more with their education because they are scared to be teased if they fail. This helps to explain why the culture of poverty tends endure from generation to generation as most of the relationships the poor have are within that class.\n\nThe \"culture of poverty\" theory has been debated and critiqued by many people including Eleanor Burke Leacock (and others) in her book \"The Culture of Poverty: A Critique\". Leacock claims that people who use the term, \"culture of poverty\" only \"contribute to the distorted characterizations of the poor.\" In addition, Michael Hannan in an essay argues that the \"culture of poverty\" is \"essentially untestable.\" This is due to many things including the highly subjective nature of poverty and issues concerning the universal act of classifying only \"some\" impoverished people as trapped in the culture.\n\n2004 research in New Zealand produced a report that showed that \"life shocks\" can be endured only to a limited extent, after which people are much more likely to be tipped into hardship. The researchers found very little differences in living standards for people who have endured up to 7 negative events in their lifetime. People who had 8 or more life shocks were dramatically more likely to live in poverty than those who had 0 to 7 life shocks. A few of the life shocks studied were:\n\nThe study focused on just a few possible life shocks, but many others are likely as traumatic or more so. Chronic PTSD, complex PTSD, and depression sufferers could have innumerable causes for their mental illness, including those studied above. The study is subject to some criticism.\n\nHistory in the United States has shown that Americans saw education as the way to end the perpetual cycle of poverty. In the present, children from low to middle income households are at a disadvantage. They are twice as likely to be held back and more likely not to graduate from high school. Recent studies have shown that the cause for the disparity among academic achievement results from the school's structure where some students succeed from an added advantage and others fail as a result of lacking that advantage. Educational institutions with a learning disparity are causing education to be a sustaining factor for the cycle of poverty. One prominent example of this type of school structures is tracking, which is predominantly used to help organize a classroom so the variability of academic ability in classes is decreased. Students are tracked based on their ability level, generally based on a standardized test after which they are given different course requirements. Some people believe that tracking \"enhances academic achievement and improves the self-concept of students by permitting them to progress at their own pace.\"\n\nThe negative side is that studies have shown that tracking decreases students' opportunity to learn. Tracking also has a disproportionate number of Latinos and African Americans that have low socioeconomic status in the lower learning tracks. Tracking separates social classes putting the poor and minority children in lower tracks where they receive second-rate education, and the students that are better off are placed in upper tracks where they have many opportunities for success. Studies have found that in addition to the higher tracks having more extensive curriculum, there is also a disparity among the teachers and instructional resources provided. There appears to be a race/class bias which results in intelligent children not receiving the skills or opportunities needed for success or social/economic mobility, thus continuing the cycle of poverty. There is an overall perception that American education is failing and research has done nothing to counter this statement, but instead has revealed the reality and severity of the issue of the existence of tracking and other structures that cause the cycle of poverty to continue.\n\nWhile many governmental officials are still trying to solve poverty, many states and localities are making an effort to break the cycle. Mayor Bloomberg of New York City has been advocating a plan where parents are paid up to $5,000 a year for meeting certain goals that will better their lives. This policy was modeled after a Mexican initiative that aims to help poor families make better decisions that will help them in the long-term and break cycle of poverty and dependence that have been known to last for generations. In addition, many states also have been making an attempt to help break the cycle. For example, a bill has been proposed in the California Assembly that \"would establish an advisory Childhood Poverty Council to develop a plan to reduce child poverty in the state by half by 2017 and eliminate it by 2027\". Even when the plan has poverty reduction as the goal, a rise in child poverty might be the reality for many states as it was in Connecticut. States are attempting to not only decrease the number of people in the cycle of poverty, but to also adjust the stringent work requirements that resulted from Congress's welfare reform. The tougher work restrictions have upset many poverty advocates that believe the new regulations prevent individuals that are vulnerable or that lack skills from preparing for work. California Democratic Representative McDermott believes as a result of this and other effects of the new limitations, it has been harder for individuals to escape a life of poverty.\nIn his book \"Children in Jeopardy: Can We Break the Cycle\", Irving B. Harris discusses ways in which children can be helped to begin breaking the cycle of poverty. He stresses the importance of starting early and teaching children the importance of education from a very young age as well as making sure these children get the same educational opportunities as students who are richer. Family values such as nurturing children and encouraging them to do well in school need to be promoted as well as a non-authoritarian approach to parenting. Harris also discusses the importance of discouraging teenage pregnancy and finding ways in which to decrease this phenomenon so that when children are born they are planned and wanted and thus have a better chance at breaking the cycle of poverty.\n\nIt has been suggested by researchers like Lane Kenworthy that increasing welfare benefits and extending them to non-working families can help reduce poverty as other nations that have done so have had better results.\n\nThe Harlem Children's Zone is working to end generational poverty within a 100-block section of Harlem using an approach that provides educational support and services for children and their families from birth through college.\nThis approach has been recognized as a model by the Obama administration's anti-poverty program.\n\nA two-generation poverty alleviation approach focuses on the education, health and social services, and opportunities that parents and children desperately need to lift their families from the depths of the bondage of poverty to a stable and healthy state mentally, physically, and financially. A two-generation approach is a holistic plan for poverty alleviation and \"is needed to help low-income parents and children improve their situation\". Using a two-generation approach, parents are taught additional career skills, provided leadership training, and given access to job opportunities with higher wages. Children are given access to better educational programs, free preschool, free childcare, and the supplies they'll need to be successful in school. The family unit receives counseling for the current stressors of poverty as well as childhood trauma. All members of the household are given access to full healthcare benefits, food services at home and in school, and financial relief for their bills, clothing, and transportation in the short-term to relieve the basic needs stressors that prevent the family from taking the time to learn and grow. The preschool program Head Start believes that the only system that works for a preschool is one where the child as a whole is considered, which includes their health and their parents' ability to succeed. The two-generation poverty alleviation approach sees each member relieved of the basic needs stressors that plague their minds, ensures that they are physically and mentally healthy, provides them the opportunities to learn the skills needed for higher wage jobs, and gives them access to higher wage jobs without discrimination.\n\nChildren are most at the mercy of the cycle of poverty. Because a child is dependent on his or her guardian(s), if a child's guardian is in poverty, then they will be also. It is almost impossible for a child to pull him or herself out of the cycle due to age, lack of experience, lack of a job, etc. Because children are at such a young and impressionable age, the scars they gain from experiencing poverty early in life inevitably carry on into their adult life. \"Childhood lays the foundations for adult abilities, interests, and motivation.\" Therefore, if they learn certain poverty-related behaviors in childhood, the behaviors are more likely to perpetuate.\n\nStudies have shown that household structure sometimes has a connection to childhood poverty. Most studies on the subject also show that the children that are in poverty tend to come from single-parent households (most often matriarchal). In 1997, nearly 8.5 million (57%) poor children in the US came from single-parent households. With the rate of divorce increasing and the number of children born out of wedlock increasing, the number of children that are born into or fall into single-parent households is also increasing. However, this does not mean that the child/children will be impoverished because of it.\n\nAccording to Ashworth, Hill, & Walker (2004), both urban and rural poor children are more likely to be isolated from the nonpoor in schools, neighborhoods, and their communities. Human nature is to have relationships with others but when a child is isolated due to their socioeconomic status, it's hard to overcome that when the status doesn't improve. Therefore, poor children also have more tense relationships which sometimes results in abnormal behavior, acting out, or other unexplained behaviors.\n\nThere have been programs developed to specifically address the needs of poor children. Francis Marion University's Center of Excellence to Prepare Teachers of Children of Poverty has a number of initiatives devoted to equipping teachers to be more effective in raising the achievement of children of poverty. Located in South Carolina, the Center provides direct teacher training as well as facilitates research in the area of poverty and scholastic achievement. A resource that is out there to try and help communities undergoing poverty are places like Head Start. Head Start is a program for low income families that provides early childhood education as well as parent involvement. Results show that attending these programs increases children's academic outcomes. The problem is that in high poverty areas this is supposed to be a helpful resource, but they start to hold lower quality due to lack of funds to keep places updated.\n\nOftentimes the communities in which impoverished children grow up in are crime ridden areas, examples of these areas are Harlem and the Bronx. These areas have effects on children as they are often exposed to crime and maltreatment at a young age, which is proven to reduce a child's ability to learn by up to 5%. Oftentimes these youth get caught up in the crime that goes on all around them, this involvement only worsens the effects of the cycle as they are often incarcerated or killed in many types of gang violence.\n\n"}

Berry joined Manchester United from Birmingham City in 1951. Despite his diminutive stature, he was a natural right winger with technique and pace.\n\nBerry was born in Aldershot in Hampshire, the son of Mary (née O'Connor) and Reginald Berry, a Sergeant in the Royal Horse Artillery; he lived with his family on Crimea Road. As a boy, he played football for St Joseph's School in Aldershot and Aldershot YMCA, and on leaving school he worked as a projectionist for a local cinema. He tried to sign for Aldershot F.C. but was told he was too short. During service with the Royal Artillery in the Second World War, he was brought to the attention of Birmingham City and signed as a professional at St Andrews in 1944.\n\nIn 1951, Matt Busby paid Birmingham City £25,000 to bring Berry to Manchester United. Berry played 277 matches for Manchester United, scoring 44 goals along the way, including helping Manchester United win three league titles. He played regularly for the first six seasons, before losing his place in the starting XI to youngster Kenny Morgans. Injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster brought his footballing career to an end at the age of 31.\n\nWhen he woke up he was totally unaware of the plane crash, his injuries having caused mild amnesia. A month after he regained consciousness, he found out about the crash from seeing a newspaper. He spent two months in hospital with a fractured skull, a broken jaw, a broken elbow, a broken pelvis, and a broken leg. All of his teeth had to be removed while treating his jaw injuries. He only found out which of his teammates had been killed some time after he returned to England. When still in hospital, he would complain to manager Matt Busby that his teammate Tommy Taylor was a poor friend for not visiting him, unaware that Taylor had been killed. Doctors treating Berry felt that he was not well enough to be told that any of his colleagues had died at the time.\n\nBerry was also capped four times by England while playing for Manchester United, his chances of regular international action inevitably restricted by the form of Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney on the wing.\n\nHis first job after retiring from football was with Massey Ferguson at Trafford Park, but in 1960 he was asked to leave the Manchester United-owned house to accommodate new signing Maurice Setters, and he left the Manchester area to return to Aldershot. He later ran a sports business with his younger brother Peter in Cove, a village near Aldershot, until the 1980s. Peter was also a professional footballer, most notably with Crystal Palace. They also ran the sports shop Berry Brothers at Queensmead in Farnbororugh. Johnny Berry spent the final years of his working life as a storeman in a local television warehouse.\n\nBerry died of cancer in a hospice in Farnham in Surrey at the age of 68 in September 1994 after a short illness and was buried in the Catholic section at Aldershot Cemetery. He was the first surviving player of the Munich air disaster to have died.\n\nHe was survived by his wife Hilda Doreen née Reeves (1928–2016), whom he married at Aldershot in 1948 and his sons Neil (who was later the head teacher of Brampton Manor School), and twins Paul (born 1952) and Craig Andrew David (1952-1995).

Its three-letter station code is IPS.\n\nThe station is operated by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving it, as part of the East Anglia franchise.\n\nThe Eastern Union Railway (EUR) opened its first terminus in Ipswich, called , in 1846 on Station Road at the other end of the current tunnel, close to the old quay for the steamboats and the aptly named Steamboat Tavern. The Ipswich Steam Navigation Company had been formed in 1824/25 during a period of \"steamship mania\" and briefly offered services from the quay between Ipswich and London calling at .\n\nThe current station is just to the north of Stoke tunnel, which was constructed as part of the Ipswich to Ely Line opening as far as St. Edmunds in late 1846.\n\nThe station was re-sited to its present location in 1860 and the main building was thought to be principally the work of Peter Bruff; who had certainly started the structure. The actual design was in the Italianate style and submitted by architect Sancton Wood (1816-1886) as part of a competition. When the new station was completed, a new road (Princes Street) linking the station to the town was also opened.\n\nBy the 1860s, the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble and most were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR). Although they wished to amalgamate formally, they could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed by the amalgamation. The island platform at Ipswich was added by the GER in 1883.\n\nIpswich engine shed (later shed code 32B) opened in 1846 and was at the south end of Stoke tunnel. It was the third-largest shed in the Great Eastern area during the steam era, after those at and .\n\nAt the beginning of World War 1, soldiers of the Norfolk Yeomanry regiment were deployed to Ipswich to guard key railway bridges in the area. They were relieved by the 9th field company Royal Engineers.\n\nIn 1923, the GER amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).\n\nOn 30 April 1932, the LNER arranged an exhibition of railway stock at Ipswich. The show was opened by Sir Arthur Churchman, of tobacco family fame, and over 16,000 visited the show. The proceeds were divided between the Ipswich and East Suffolk Hospital and railway charities. The exhibits were (class/wheel arrangement/number/name):\n\nThe show also included a sleeping car and a new composite corridor coach.\n\nIn 1948, following nationalisation of the railways, Ipswich became part of the British Railways Eastern Region.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the costs of running the dated mechanical signalling systems north of Colchester was recognised and, in 1978, a scheme for track rationalisation and re-signalling was duly submitted to the Department of Transport. This was followed by a proposal to electrify the Great Eastern Main Line in 1980.\n\nThe early 1980s saw track rationalisation and signalling work carried out in the Ipswich area and, on 9 April 1985, the first electric train consisting of two Class 305 electric multiple units (EMU) worked into Ipswich station. The previous year another member of the class had been dragged to Ipswich by a diesel locomotive and was used for crew training. The first passenger carrying train was formed of British Rail Class 309 EMUs which ran on 17 April 1985. The plan was for most trains to be formed of British Rail Class 86 locomotives which, until the line to Norwich was electrified, would changeover with the Class 47s at Ipswich and this arrangement commenced from 1 May 1985. During 1985-87, the line to Norwich was electrified and through electric working commenced in May 1987.\n\nThe station's original lifts were removed in 1983 when the line was electrified.\n\nFollowing the privatisation of British Rail, services from Ipswich were operated by Anglia Railways from 1997 until 2004, after which the franchise was won by National Express East Anglia (operating under the 'one' brand, including 'one' Great Eastern and 'one' Anglia, until February 2008).\n\nIn the five years between 2004–05 and 2008–09, patronage rose by 50% from 2 million per year to 3 million per year. Ticket barriers were installed in the station building in 2009 and the exit gate on platform 2 was closed permanently.\n\nNew lifts, which had been promised for many years since they were removed in 1983, were opened in June 2011.\n\nIn October 2011, the Department for Transport awarded the new franchise to Abellio, the services formerly operated by National Express transferring to Greater Anglia in February 2012. Abellio then became responsible for the operation of Ipswich station.\n\n\nThere is an avoiding line between the lines that serve the main through platforms 2 and 3.\n\nPrior to electrification there were two short sidings at the London end of the \"up\" platform which were used for locomotive changes on up trains when required.\n\nPlatforms 3 and 4 can be accessed via the footbridge or lift.\n\nOpposite platform 4 is a stabling point used by Freightliner diesel and electric locomotives. Classes 66, 70, 86 and 90 are the most common, although locomotives of other companies have been known to use the point in the past. In July 2019 Freightliner was granted planning permission to build a maintenance depot within the yard.\n\nThe station has extensive facilities including self-service ticket machines, ticket counters, a convenience store, two cafes, a multi-storey car park, taxi stand, bus station and ATMs. The whole stations is now fully accessible, with lifts having been installed in 2011.\n\nThe entrance to the station was remodelled during 2015 in a £1 million scheme.\n\nPassenger train services to and from Ipswich have always been dominated by the main line to London Liverpool Street; however, to the north, as well as Norwich, some services used the East Suffolk Line with trains for Great Yarmouth South Town station or, after that was closed, Lowestoft. Through-trains operated until the 1980s and were briefly revived in the early part of the 21st century, although the need for more commuter seats south of Colchester saw these terminating at Ipswich (although two daily services are extended to Harwich International).\nMany minor local stations closed during the 1960s, as did branch lines to Framlingham and Aldeburgh. Branch services on the Felixstowe line have, with the exception of the first few years of that line’s existence, started from Ipswich as have local stopping services on the East Suffolk, Norwich and Cambridge lines. One interesting working in the 1920s and 1930s was a train that operated from Sheffield via Worksop, Spalding, March and Ely to Felixstowe during the summer months.\n\nBy far the most interesting working was the “Boat Train” which operated between Harwich Parkeston Quay and various destinations until the 1990s. The privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s saw this service terminated at Peterborough. Another long-distance working was from Colchester to York via Lincoln, which ran for a number of years.\n\nThroughout the steam era trains were predominantly hauled by Great Eastern Railway locomotives and, indeed, when steam ended in Suffolk in 1960, some of these locomotives were still operated. After the grouping of 1923, LNER designed locomotives were also employed in the area with the B17 4-6-0 class working many main line services. After nationalisation in 1948, British Railways introduced the Britannia class 4-6-2 class which worked main line services until succeeded by diesels in the late 1950s.\n\nEast Anglia was the first area to be worked completely by diesel trains with Class 40s taking over main line express workings. The first one of these ran in June 1958, complete with a headboard with the wording \"First Diesel Hauled train on the GE in public service\". These were succeeded by Class 37 and Class 47 up until electrification in the mid-1980s when Class 86 and then Class 90 locomotives took over in 2003.\nLocal services in the diesel era were worked by Diesel Multiple Units, although smaller diesel locomotives such as Class 31 worked local trains such as Ipswich - Birmingham during the 1980s.\n\nFormer train operating company Anglia Railways ran services known as London Crosslink from Norwich to via Stratford. This service started in 2000 and ended in 2002, employing British Rail Class 170 DMUs.\n\nThe following services typically call at Ipswich:\n\nIpswich has a number of goods facilities and a myriad of private sidings as well as extensive railways in the docks.\n\nThis is located between Ipswich and East Suffolk Junction on the east side of the line. The yard is still active (as of 2018) with Freightliner (container) trains recessing or running round before running to/from the docks at Felixstowe.\n\nIn the past a branch from this yard ran down and across Ranelagh Road, crossed the River Gipping to Ipswich Lower Yard and the eastern part of Ipswich docks but traffic ceased in circa 1990. The remains of the branch line are still visible today (2018).\n\nIn the main yard a transhipment shed existed for a number of years where small consignments were transferred between wagons; there was no public or road access to this facility, which closed in 1951.\nLocal and regional freight trains serving local stations as well as the other goods facilities in the Ipswich area were re-marshalled in this yard. Regional destinations included Goodmayes and Temple Mills in London and Whitemoor (March) in Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe yard was developed for longer trains during 2014 with improved access to and from the East Suffolk Line and longer sidings. The majority of trains are traffic to or from Felixstowe Docks.\n\nAnother branch further to the north crossed over Ranelagh Road to a headshunt and then served a warehouse. This was built circa 1920 and was at one time going to be a new route into Ipswich docks avoiding the level crossing on the other branch. The warehouse served a number of companies including Boots, J Lyons & Co, McFarLanes Biscuits, and Swift and Co. The site was also used to dump redundant permanent way materials and in the 1970s travelling circuses used the site.\n\nThe bridge was demolished in 1967 and an abutment remains (in 2013). The rest of this site has been redeveloped with retail facilities.\n\nThis yard contained a wooden goods shed where goods for the town were loaded or unloaded. Cattle pens were also located close to this yard (traffic ceased in the 1960s) and there was a siding to Constantine Road power station. A small engine shed was located in this area for locomotives that worked in the docks (although they were officially allocated to Ipswich engine shed). At the east end of the yard the railway lines crossed over Bridge Street (which until the 1980s was the first road crossing over the River Orwell) and from 1903 there was a tram line necessitating special signaling arrangements between the two systems.\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century a construction terminal and a British Oxygen Company terminal were also located in this area. Most of the site has now been redeveloped into retail premises.\n\nThe docks were served by a myriad of dockside lines which fell out of use during the 1990s and few remnants of the dockside lines are evident today.\n\nThis was built as a branch off the Bury line in 1848 crossing the River Gipping adjacent to the station and served the northern side of the docks area . The town corporation would not allow steam engines to pass over Stoke Bridge so the dockside tramway was worked by horses until the corporation relented in 1880. However even then the locomotives had to be fitted with animal guards and side valances, an arrangement that continued until 9 May 1969.\n\nAn early customer of this line was a carriage building company called Quadling. Initially starting business as Catt and Quadling they built a number of carriages for the Eastern Union Railway at a works in Handford Road, Ipswich. This premises which had no railway access was blown down in a gale in February 1847 damaging several carriages under construction and after that Catt withdrew from the rail side of the business but continued making road carts. Quadling relocated to new premises (located in the modern day Quadling Street in Ipswich) and had a siding off the branch. The company built further carriages for the EUR and Great Western Railway as well as some coal wagons. However this premises also suffered significant gale damage in February 1863 leading to Quadling becoming bankrupt.\n\nIpswich Lower Goods Yard was constructed by the ECR on this line in 1860.\n\nAfter 1880 the lines were worked by small locomotives with enclosed wheels such as J70 tram engines. The dockside tramways covered both sides of the dock and crossed the 1881 lock gates at the south end of the dock. Freight was switched between trains and ships on the dockside.\n\nSidings were provided for the following businesses (list not complete or date specific):\n\n\nFreight traffic to the docks ceased when freightliner (container) and grain traffic to Cliff Quay ceased in 1992.\n\nThis is where the main line for Norwich and the East Suffolk Line split. There were industrial sidings serving Eastern Counties Farmers, Petters (Ipswich) Limited and Manganese Bronze and Brass. These companies had their own locomotives which worked to and from the upper yard.\n\nAn extensive site with loading and unloading platforms was developed in 1934 to serve the needs of the 1934 Royal Agricultural Show which was held on 3–7 July 1934 at Chantry Park. A civil engineers depot was developed here afterwards.\n\nIn 2013 it was suggested that this area will be the site of the locomotive fuelling point which will be relocated from the station. However no such move had materialised by the September 2018.\n\nA British Sugar Corporation owned facility (which traded as Ipswich Beet Sugar Factory until 1936) which had its own fleet of industrial locomotives although on occasion shunting locomotives from Ipswich engine shed were also hired out to the factory. The sidings were established in 1925 and at times were used as an overflow when the upper yard at Ipswich was congested. Rail traffic ceased in 1982.\nThis branch still exists (as of 2018) but traffic has been sporadic over the last few years, In 2013 it was not until 20 August that traffic in the form of sea dredged aggregate was operated on the branch. It was hoped this would be a weekly trip and sand traffic to Watford was also expected.\n\nOriginally known as the Griffin Wharf Branch it had sidings serving dockside sidings such as (note list not complete or date specific):\n\nA couple of shunting horses were based at this location during Great Eastern days (pre-1923). \nThe West Bank Ferry terminal was developed in 1973.\n\nDerby Road railway station and Westerfield railway station both had goods yards and a number of industrial facilities were located on the Felixstowe Branch Line.\n\nA small set of sidings existed at the south end of Ipswich station on the up side of the tracks adjacent to the tunnel. Only one track was accessible from the main line the other sidings being accessed from a wagon turntable. Shunting horses were used in this location to position the vehicles and Ipswich had an allocation of around 30 horses in the 1890s. One track off the wagon turntable led to a small shed which housed a steam fire engine mounted on a flat truck.\n\nBy the 1970s only a single siding remained which was used to occasionally stable locomotives and was lifted c1980.\n\nThe following is a list of signal boxes found during the period during Ipswich was controlled by mechanical signaling. The last of these boxes closed in 1985 when the area was re-signalled and electrified. Currently all signals are controlled from Colchester Power Signal Box.\n\n\nWater troughs were installed at Halifax Junction in 1897 south of Ipswich tunnel. These were used by trains to pick up water using a scoop operated by the engine crew, although water cranes were located on the platforms at the station as well. Using the troughs was a quicker method of filling the tenders of steam locomotives and they were located between the rails in the centre of the tracks. These were heated in winter to prevent freezing. The Ipswich troughs fell out of use in the 1960s when steam locomotives were withdrawn from East Anglia.\n\nIpswich tunnel was built by the Eastern Union Railway's engineer Peter Bruff and opened in November 1846. Trains from Bury St. Edmunds passed the existing station site (at that point undeveloped) and continued to Halifax Junction south of the tunnel where they then reversed into the original Croft street terminus.\n\nThe tunnel was built as there was no room between the River Orwell and Stoke Hill to build a railway and is thought to be the first tunnel in the world to be built on a continuous curve. During its construction many fossils were found including those of a wooly mammoth.\n\nThere have been two accidents in the tunnel. On 5 May 1910 a wagon examiner was taking a short cut through the tunnel (this was forbidden) when it is believed he tripped whilst trying to get out of the way of an engine. On 21 August 1912 a platelayer (track worker) was hit by the engine of a troop train having failed to get out of the way.\n\nFurther excavations in 1908 and 1919 were led by Nina Frances Layard revealed remains of mammoths, a turtle and lions. The latter excavation was as a result of the GER widening the cutting east of the tunnel to accommodate some additional sidings. Further bones were found in 1975 by archeologist John Wymer.\n\nFor many years the tunnel was regarded as an obstacle to electrification with insufficient clearance for the overhead wires. In 1985 however the tunnel was temporarily closed and the track bed lowered to accommodate the overhead electric lines.\n\nThe tunnel was closed again in 2004 to allow for work to lower the track in order to enable larger containers to pass through on goods trains to and from the port of Felixstowe.\n\nThe Ipswich Railway Chord (or 'Bacon Factory Chord' in early documentation), officially the Bacon Factory Curve is a short section of track constructed to link the East Suffolk Line and the Great Eastern Main Line just North of Ipswich Goods Yard. This chord, which was opened to traffic in March 2014, allows freight trains from the Port of Felixstowe to access the West Coast Main Line using the Ipswich to Ely Line and a cross-country route via Nuneaton, rather than via the Great Eastern Main Line and the North London Line.\n\nThe chord was built on the site of an old Bacon Factory, hence its original name. It has been reported that the finished scheme should \"take 750,000 lorries off the roads\".\n\nPreliminary work for the chord started in August 2012, and the Secretary of State for Transport granted full development consent on 5 September 2012, coming into effect on 26 September 2012. Two new junctions were created by the scheme - Boss Hall Junction at the eastern end of the chord with the East Suffolk Line and Europa Junction with the Great Eastern Main Line located close to the site of the Sproughton sugar beet sidings.\n\nThe chord opened to regular traffic on 31 March 2014 although the first revenue earning train headed by Class 66 locomotive 66733 on a Felixstowe - Doncaster container train ran on 24 March.\n\nThe first, and so far only passenger train to have used the chord was on 11 November 2017, when Flying Scotsman used the chord to turn around her Norwich to Ipswich \"Cathedrals Express\" Railtour.\n\n"}

The term(s) are used in contrast to \"Shiryō\", which refers to the spirit of those who are already deceased.\n\nThe popular belief that the human spirit (or soul) can escape from the body has been around since early times, with eyewitness accounts and experiences (hauntings, possessions, out-of-body experience) reported in anecdotal and fictional writings. of the living are said to inflict upon the subject or subjects of their vengeance by means of transforming into their ikiryō form. It is believed that if a sufficient grudge is held, all or part of the perpetrator's soul leaves the body, appearing in front of the victim to harm or curse them, a concept not so dissimilar from the evil eye. The ikiryō has even made its way into Buddhist scriptures, where they are described as \"living spirits\" who, if angered, might bring about curses, even just before their death. Possession is another means by which the Ikiryō are commonly believed to be capable of inflicting harm, the possessed person thought to be unaware of this process. However, according to mythology, the ikiryō does not necessarily act out of spite or vengefulness, and stories are told of the ikiryō who bears no grudge, or poses no real threat. In recorded examples, the spirit sometimes takes possession of another person's body for motives other than vengeance, such as love and infatuation (for example the Matsutōya ghost below). A person's ikiryō may also leave the body (often very shortly before death) to manifest its presence around loved ones, friends and/or acquaintances.\n\nIn classical literature, \"The Tale of Genji\" (ca. 1000) describes the \"well known\" episode of the \"ikisudama\" (the more archaic term for \"ikiryō\") that emerged from Genji's lover Lady Rokujo, and tormented Genji's pregnant wife Aoi no Ue, resulting in her death after childbirth. This spirit is also portrayed in \"Aoi no Ue\", the Noh play adaptation of the same story. After her death, Lady Rokujo became an \"onryō\" and went on to torment those who would later become Genji's consorts, Murasaki and .\n\nIn the Heian period, a human soul leaving a body and drifting away is described by the old verb \"akugaru\" meaning \"departure\". In \"The Tale of Genji\", the mentally troubled Kashiwagi fears that his soul may be found wandering (\"akugaru\"), and requests that last rites are performed on his body to stop his soul from escaping if this should happen. and by Murakami.\n\n\"Konjaku Monogatarishū\" contains the tale of \"How the Ikiryo Spirit of Omi Province Came and Killed a Man of the Capital.\" In the tale, a commoner encounters a noblewoman and guides her to the house of a certain in the capital. Little did the guide know that he was guiding the \"ikiryō\" of a woman to her neglecting husband. Upon reaching the house the lady vanishes, though the gates remain shut. Wailing noises are heard inside the house. The following morning, the guide learns that the master of the house had complained the \"ikiryō\" of his former wife was present and causing him illness, shortly after which he died. The guide later seeks out the lady's house in Ōmi Province. There a woman speaks to him through blinds, acknowledging the man's services that day, and showers him with gifts of silk cloth.\n\nThe \"ikiryō\" can also possess the object of its infatuation, who is neither rival nor enemy. The \"Matsutōya yūrei\", a tale allegedly based on events that occurred during Kyōhō 14 or 15 (1729–30), a Kyoto merchant named had a teenaged son named Matsunosuke possessed by the spirit of two women who loved him, and who tormented the boy's conscience. On occasion, he would be suspended in mid-air, engaging in conversation as if the girls were present before his eyes, the ikiryō's words being spoken through the boy's lips. Finally the family sought help from a renowned priest named Zōkai. The priest successfully exorcised the boy and cured his condition, but rumors had already spread regarding the incident.\nThe horror story (\"kaidan\") collection (published Kanbun 3, or 1663) includes a tale of a woman whose \"ikiryō\" assumed the shape of her severed head. One night, a man traveling towards Kyoto arrives at place called Sawaya in Kita-no-shō, Echizen Province (now Fukui City), where he mistakedly thinks he saw a chicken fly from the base of a nearby stone tower on to the road. The imagined chicken turns out to be (or has transformed into) a lively severed head of a woman. When the face grins at him, he attacks with a sword, and chases it to a home in the capital of the province. Inside the house, the housewife awakes from a nightmare being chased by a man brandishing a blade. The wandering head was, according to the title, the woman's , or her wayward thoughts and obsessions. The woman later turns Buddhist nun to repent for her sins.\n\nSightings of \"ikiryō\" belonging to those whose deaths are imminent have been recorded from all over Japan. Stories abound of spirits that materialize (or otherwise manifest their presence) to someone dear to them, such as immediate family. The recipient of the visit experiencing a metaphysical foreshadowing of this person's death, before any tangible news of bereavement arrives.\n\nMany of the local terms for the \"ikiryō\" were collected by Kunio Yanagita and his school of folklorists.\n\nIn the tradition of the Nishitsugaru District, Aomori Prefecture, the souls of the person/s on the brink of death are called \"amabito,\" and believed to depart from the body and walk around, sometimes making noises like that of the door sliding open.\n\nAccording to Yanagita, is the equivalent term to the Senboku District, Akita region. Yanagita defines this as the ability of certain persons to traverse the world in their Ikirȳo form. Such individuals are purported to have voluntary control of this ability, in contrast to those who are only temporarily capable of tapping into such a state as a precursor to their death.\n\nIn the Kazuno District in Akita Prefecture, a soul that pays visit to acquaintances is called an , and assumes the form of a living human, that is to say, it has feet and make pitter-patter noises, unlike the stereotypical Japanese ghost that have no legs or feet.\n\nYanagita in \"Tōno monogatari shūi\" reported that in the Tōno Region, Iwate Prefecture, \"the thoughts of the dead or the living coalesce into a walking shape, and appear to the human eye as an illusion is termed an \"omaku\" in this region.\" An example being a beautiful girl aged 16 or 17, critically ill with a case of (Typhoid fever or a similar disease). She was seen wandering around the construction site of the Kōganji temple rebuild project in , the days before her death.\n\nIn Kashima District, Ishikawa on the Noto Peninsula, a folklorist recorded belief in the , said to appear 2 or 3 days before someone's death, which was seen passing through on its visits to \"danna-dera\" (The family temple, also called \"bodaiji\"). The temple was believed to be the soul's final resting grounds, where one finds a place amongst their ancestors.\n\nThere are cases where the wandering \"ikiryō\" appear as a floating \"soul flame\", known in Japan as the \"hitodama\" or \"hidama\". However, a \"soul flame\" from a person who is near death is not considered unusual, with the traditional conception among Japanese being that the soul escapes the body within a short phase (several days) either \"before or after\" death. Therefore, pre-death soul flames may not be treated as cases of \"ikiryō\" in works on the subject of ghosts, but filed under chapters on the \"hitodama\" phenomenon.\n\nOne case of a near-death \"hitodama\" deemed 'suitable for discussion' under the topic of \"ikiryō\" by a folklorist closely resembled the aforementioned tale of the woman's head in the \"Sorori Monogatari\", namely, that the subject who witnessed the soul's apparition pursued it ruthlessly, until he discovered the owner of the soul, who claimed to have seen the entire experience of being chased during a dream. The subject worked at the town office of Tōno, Iwate, and one night, he reported seeing an \"hidama\" emerge from a stable and into the house's entrance where it was 'flying around'. He claimed to have chased it with a broom, and trapped it beneath a washbasin. A while after, he was rushed out to see his sick uncle on the brink of death, but he made sure to release the fireball from its trapping. He soon learned that his uncle had only just died, but his uncle came back to life again, enough so to accuse the nephew of chasing him with a broom and capturing him. Similarly, the folklore archives of Umedoi, Mie Prefecture (now part of Inabe) tells a tale about a band of men who, late in the night, spotted and chased a fireball into a sake warehouse, waking a maid who was asleep inside. The maid later professed to being \"pursued by many men and fleeing\" to take refuge in the warehouse.\n\nDuring the Edo period, there was a belief that there was a condition called , whereby the soul would not just separate from the body, but assume the shape and appearance of the sufferer. The condition was also known interchangeably as , alternately written as .\n\nThis affliction is treated as an instance of \"ikiryō\" by folklorist Ensuke Konno in his chapter on the topic. The case study example is that of Yūji Kita, doomed by the \"kage no yamai\" for three generations in succession, recorded in the by Tadano Makuzu (d. 1825).\n\nThe identical double might be seen by the sufferer or be witnessed by others, and can be classed as a doppelgänger phenomenon. Others have reported a sort of out-of-body experience, whereby their consciousness inhabits the \"ikiryō\" to see their own lifeless body.\n\nThe is, when one, in the hour of the ox (1AM to 3AM), strikes a nail in a sacred tree, and thus becomes an \"oni\" while alive, and using these oni powers, would inflict curses and calamity upon a rival. Although many \"ikiryō\" generally are spirits of humans that leave the body unconsciously and move about, deeds akin to performing magic rituals and intentionally tormenting a target can also be interpreted as ikiryō. In the same way, in the Okinawa Prefecture, performing of a magic ritual with the intention of becoming an \"ikiryō\" is termed .\n\n\n"}

He worked with Louis Sullivan and later with William Gray Purcell as a partner in the firm Purcell & Elmslie.\n\nElmslie began his apprenticeship in the office of William LeBaron Jenney, who originated the steel frame skeleton used in modern building construction. In 1887, Elmslie joined Frank Lloyd Wright and George Maher in the office of Joseph Lyman Silsbee, a Western New York based architect who had moved to Chicago. After Wright left to go to work for Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan in 1887, he recommended Elmslie to Sullivan. In 1888, Elsmlie joined Wright at Adler & Sullivan, which led to a 20-year association between Elmslie and Sullivan. Wright and Elmslie shared an office next to Sullivan's. Elmslie was Sullivan’s chief draftsman and ornamental designer. He detailed the ornamentation for Sullivan’s Wainwright Building in St. Louis, the Schlesinger & Mayer Department store in Chicago and the National Farmers Bank in Owatonna, Minnesota.\n\nThe architectural practice most widely known as Purcell & Elmslie consisted of three partnerships. The first, Purcell & Feick, was created at Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1907 between Purcell and his Cornell School of Architecture classmate, George Feick, Jr. George Elmslie and Purcell had been friends since 1903, when Purcell worked for a short while in the office of Louis Sullivan, and Elmslie was an informal influence in the work of Purcell & Feick. In 1909, Elmslie joined the office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the name of the firm changed to Purcell, Feick, & Elmslie in 1910. Feick left the partnership in 1912, and the name of the practice became Purcell & Elmslie until being dissolved in 1921.\n\nOver the course of the partnership, Purcell & Elmslie became one of the most commissioned firms among the Prairie School architects, second only to Frank Lloyd Wright. Following the dissolution of his partnership with Purcell, Elmslie worked occasionally with various other architects, including Lawrence A. Fournier, William S. Hutton, Hermann V. von Holst, William Eugene Drummond, and William L. Steele, and produced a number of banks, train stations, commercial, and institutional buildings during the 1920s and 1930s. In private practice Elmslie concentrated primarily on commercial designs. As his commission work decreased, he sought work with William S. Hutton and helped him with the design of the Washington Irving, the Oliver Morton and the Thomas Edison Schools in Hammond, Indiana, and also the design of Thornton Township High School in Calumet City, Illinois.\n\nElmslie was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1947.\n\nA curious historical note: Elmslie claimed to have been born in 1871, and he carefully kept his true birth year a secret all his life except from a very few people. The apparent reason for this was due to his immigration status in 1885, when he joined his father John Elmslie in Chicago from his native Scotland. Had Elmslie divulged his true age, he would have been ineligible to enter the United States as a dependent family member. Elmslie died on April 23, 1952 and is interred at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.\n\n\n"}

He made his debut in February 1951 as a 17-year-old centre forward and went on to play almost 250 League games, scoring 66 League and Cup goals with the Owls. He was in his prime with Sheffield Wednesday, and gained much media attention, becoming the Golden Boy of British football.\n\nQuixall joined Manchester United in September 1958 for a then British record fee of £45,000, one of Matt Busby's key recruits in building a new team in the aftermath of the Munich air disaster, which had killed eight players and ended the careers of two others on 6 February that year. After seven games without a win for United, Quixall eventually helped the team go on a run of only two losses in 23 matches to end the season as runners-up in the First Division. Quixall's only medal with the club was the 1963 FA Cup. Altogether, he scored 56 goals in 184 games for the Red Devils.\n\nAlong with Johnny Giles and David Herd, he was dropped after Everton thrashed United 4–0 in the 1963 FA Charity Shield. He rarely featured in the 1963–64 season, last appearing for United on Boxing Day 1963.\n\nHe left the club at the end of the season, moving to Oldham Athletic for £7,000, spending two years at Boundary Park before finishing his professional career at Stockport County in 1967.\n\nQuixall was capped five times for England in 1954 and 1955. He also made schoolboy, Under-23 and 'B' appearances for his country, and played for a Football League representative side on four occasions.\n\nManchester United\n"}

It is one of the two major connections between Montreal and Quebec City, the other being Autoroute 20 on the south shore of the St. Lawrence. Autoroute 40 is currently long. Between the Ontario–Quebec boundary and the interchange with Autoroute 25, the route is signed as part of the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\nThe western terminus of Autoroute 40 is located at the Ontario–Quebec border, where it continues as Highway 417 towards Ottawa; the eastern terminus is in Boischatel, where it transitions into Route 138 at the end of the freeway.\n\nThe portion of Autoroute 40 from the Ontario border to Autoroute 25 is part of the Trans-Canada Highway. The Metropolitan Autoroute portion in Montreal is the busiest highway in Quebec, the busiest section of the Trans-Canada Highway, as well as the second busiest highway section overall in Canada after Highway 401 in Toronto.\n\nTwo sections of Autoroute 40 were not part of the original plans: The original intention was to bypass Trois-Rivières to the north (the existing A-40 through downtown would have been Autoroute 755 and the concurrency with Autoroute 55 would have been simply A-55). In addition, a different route was originally planned around Sainte-Foy (now in the west end of Quebec City) south of Jean Lesage International Airport (the existing segment of Autoroute 40 between St-Augustin and Autoroute 73 would have been the western end of Autoroute 440, thus explaining the exit numbering starting at 12). While the right-of-ways of both bypasses still exist and may still be developed in the future as congestion increases, there are no immediate plans to renew construction.\n\nSome discussion of eastward extensions of A-40 into the Charlevoix region and beyond have taken place, most likely to Route 360 in Beaupré or even as far as Route 362 in La Malbaie since tourism in the region is increasing; however, that appears unlikely in the short term.\n\nA stretch of the highway in Pointe-Claire, from roughly St. John's Boulevard, near Fairview Pointe-Claire Shopping Centre, to the turnaround loop, Senneville Road was used during the 1976 Summer Olympics for the men's road team time trial cycling race.\n\nIn 1997, the highway (apart from the portion served by the Metropolitan Autoroute) was renamed Autoroute Félix-Leclerc after the late Quebec artist and political activist Félix Leclerc.\n\nPrior to 1997, Autoroute 40 east of Montreal had four different names, the first section was named \"Autoroute de la Rive-Nord\" (North Shore Autoroute) between Montréal and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures (km 87 to 196, 209 to 296). A segment in Trois-Rivières east of Autoroute 55 that was named \"Autoroute de Francheville\" (Francheville Autoroute) (km 196 to 207). Between Saint-Augustin and Autoroute 73 in Quebec City (km 296 to 307) it was called \"Autoroute Charest\". Finally, between the junction of Autoroute 73 and Autoroute 573 and its eastern end at Route 138 it was known as \"Autoroute de la Capitale\", a name that is still commonly used by Quebec City residents.\n\n"}

NOVA Chemicals' products are used in a wide variety of applications, including food and electronics packaging, industrial materials, appliances and a variety of consumer goods. The company operates two business units and holds a 50% interest in a major joint venture with INEOS, called INEOS NOVA.\n\nIn 1954, the Alberta legislature under Ernest Manning passed the \"Alberta Gas Trunk Line Company Act\", creating the Alberta Gas Trunk Line Company (AGTL) Crown Corporation, with a monopoly on natural gas transportation (pipelines) within the province. Construction began in 1956 and gas began flowing in 1957. In the 1970s, AGTL expanded into the chemicals industry. The company was privatized in 1961 and was renamed NOVA Corporation in 1980, and by 1989 was considered a \"petrochemical and pipeline giant.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, NOVA had controlling ownership of Calgary-based Husky Oil. NOVA sold the last of its stake in Husky in 1991.\n\nIn 1998, NOVA Corporation split in two, with its pipeline business (with $11 billion in annual sales) merging with TransCanada Pipelines and its chemicals business ($2.4 billion sales) becoming a publicly traded company, NOVA Chemicals. Shortly after the split, then-CEO Jeffrey Lipton moved NOVA Chemicals' head office from Calgary to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While this move was made in order to be closer to US customers, the benefits of the move never materialized. It was also seen as a snub to the province of Alberta, as Premier Ed Stelmach refused to grant NOVA Chemicals a bailout in 2009 due to the financial meltdown and recession, as well as the company's heavy debt load.\n\nOn July 6, 2009, the International Petroleum Investment Company (since 2016 IPIC merged with Mubadala), which is wholly owned by the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, completed the 100% purchase of NOVA Chemicals, and transferred its place of incorporation to the Province of New Brunswick.\n\nIn the United States, NOVA Chemicals has focused recent expansion in the Gulf Coast area. This includes acquiring an olefins plant that produces roughly 1.95 billion pounds of ethylene annually in Geismar, Louisiana, which was purchased from Williams Partners. The company is also considering the building of a new polyethylene plant in St. Clair Township.\n\nThe Olefins/Polyolefins business unit produces and sells ethylene, PE resins and co-products from its two manufacturing centers located in Alberta and Ontario, Canada. The business is built on its feedstock cost advantage in Alberta, world-scale and energy-efficient manufacturing facilities and proprietary \"Advanced SCLAIRTECH\" and gas-phase polyethylene technology.\n\nThe Olefins/Polyolefins business unit contains three reporting segments:\n\nPerformance Styrenics manufactures and sells expandable polystyrene (EPS) in North America and specialty Polymers. This business unit also has interests in EPS-based downstream ventures and businesses for end-use consumer and industrial applications.\n\nINEOS NOVA is a 50:50 joint venture between NOVA Chemicals and INEOS that manufactures and sells styrene, solid polystyrene (SPS) and EPS.\n\nUntil September 30, 2007, NOVA Chemicals operated a commodity styrenics business unit known as STYRENIX, which manufactured and sold styrene and SPS in North America. It also manufactured and sold SPS and EPS in Europe through NOVA Innovene, its 50:50 joint venture with INEOS.\n\nOn October 1, 2007, NOVA Chemicals and INEOS expanded their European joint venture to include the North American styrene and SPS businesses of both companies. NOVA Chemicals no longer reports the results of its STYRENIX business unit but rather its interest in INEOS NOVA.\n"}

{"id": "1796328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796328", "title": "Fred Swanton", "text": "Fred Swanton\n\nFred Wilder Swanton (1862–1940) was an entrepreneur and real estate developer who served as mayor of Santa Cruz, California from 1927 until 1933. He promoted the expansion of Santa Cruz as a beach resort city. The seaside resort he established in 1904 remains today as the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.\n\nFred Swanton was born April 11, 1862 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was Albion Paris Swanton (1826–1911) who traveled to California in 1864, and was then followed by his wife Emily (Parshley) Swanton with Fred in 1866. After living briefly in Pescadero, California they settled in Santa Cruz, California in 1867. Swanton attended public schools and then graduated from Heald Business College in 1881.\nHe worked as a bookkeeper at various lumber companies in California until 1883, when he and his mother traveled east to visit relatives. He returned with the patent license for the telephone, which he sold through most of California. On December 25, 1884 he married Stanley Hall in Santa Cruz. He operated a hotel called the Swanton House with his father and ran Knight's Opera House theater. The hotel was the tallest building in the city when it was built. It burned down on May 30, 1887, and he started a livery business called Bonner Stables, and then a store called the Palace of Pharmacy, and briefly owned a billboard business. In October 1889 he sold those businesses, and with Dr. H. H. Clark started the first electric company in the area. He developed the Santa Cruz Electric Railway which ran cars from the beach to Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz-Capitola Railroad to the new resort of Capitola, California to the south. In 1900 he invested in the Klondike Gold Rush, but by then the profits had been made. He also dabbled in oil fields and a chromite mine.\n\nSince 1865 the first of several bath houses operated on the Santa Cruz beach, and in 1868 a small boardwalk was built. Swanton envisioned developing the area into a resort similar to Atlantic City, New Jersey or Coney Island near his native Brooklyn. In October 1903 he held a meeting at the courthouse and predicted shares in his enterprise would return up to 25%.\nOn October 29, 1903 the Santa Cruz Beach, Cottage, and Tent City Corporation was formed, and over US$100,000 was raised. Swanson was Director-General (although personally invested only $250). He traveled throughout the state selling shares, eventually raising $1.5million. Existing bath houses were purchased with stock shares, and a tent city was constructed on land leased from the Southern Pacific Railway. In April 1904 the city granted an exclusive franchise for the beach to the company. Although some residents protested because the city had paid for many improvements such as extending roads, mayor David C. Clark (supported by Swanton in his election campaign) broke a tie in the city council to award the contract.\nIn the summer of 1904 the Neptune Casino (named after one of the original bath houses) was built, designed by architect Edward L. Van Cleeck. The Casino had a style similar to the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England (the New Brighton State Beach lies a few miles to the south). The two story building with of beach front, was painted bright colors, and included dining rooms, a ballroom, and theater. A third floor rotunda was used as an observatory with views of the ocean. A \"pleasure pier\" long built over intake pipes for the baths (called the Plunge) was lit by electric lights. An opening ceremony was held June 11, 1904.\n\nAfter a profitable first year, the pier was extended in 1905, and Swanton planned further expansion.\nThe Neptune Casino survived the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but burned down on June 22, 1906 from a kitchen fire.\nA large tent was erected and the Republican Party of California held their convention there in the summer.\nSwanton sold his electric company and trolley business to free up capital, and again raised more money to rebuild. Architect William Henry Weeks was hired to design an even larger complex which opened by June 15, 1907. \n\nIn 1908, the first \"thrill ride\" opened, a miniature railway designed by LaMarcus Adna Thompson. In 1911, a carousel commissioned from Charles I. D. Looff was installed with an 1894 band organ from Andreas Ruth & Sohn.\nSwanton developed the Casa Del Rey Hotel across the street from the Casino in 1911. By 1912, a business downturn caused by the Panic of 1910–1911 wiped out the original stockholders. For the third time Swanton convinced investors to raise funds for the enterprise. By 1915 the Santa Cruz Seaside Company took over with Swanton again becoming an investor.\n\nSwanton tried to convince Hollywood movie producers to film in Santa Cruz. The silent film \"A Romance of the Redwoods\" was filmed in the area by Cecil B. DeMille. Edward Ferguson and W.D. Dalton (under the name \"Fer Dal\") and Theodore Wharton established studios briefly, but interest waned during World War I.\n\nIn 1914 Swanton acted as agent of actress ZaSu Pitts, and staged a benefit performance at the Opera House to finance the start of her film career. He became so well known the city was sometimes called Swanticruz or Swanta Cruz. He became president of the Combined Amusement Company to build exhibits for the amusement park called the Zone at the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. In 1924 he obtained the Miss America franchise for the state and started the Miss California beauty pageant, which was held in Santa Cruz until 1985. The first \"Miss Santa Cruz\", Fay Lanphier won the first two contests and became Miss America in 1925. \nSwanton was elected mayor of Santa Cruz on July 4, 1927, and was reelected for two more terms until 1933, when Roy Hammond took the office. \n\nProhibition reduced profits, and the Neptune Casino had its name changed to \"Cocoanut Grove\". Business declined and his plans for real estate development fell through during the Great Depression. \n\nSwanton died September 3, 1940, almost bankrupt. He was described as a cross between P. T. Barnum and California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge, or the \"P. T. Barnum of Santa Cruz\".\n\nThe resort is still owned by the private Santa Cruz Seaside Company. The amusement park is known as the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, which is a California Historical Landmark. and National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe community of Swanton and Swanton Road, to the north of Santa Cruz were named after him, site of the Swanton Pacific Ranch where his hydro-electric power generators were built.\nThe site of his failed subdivision (at his namesake Swanton Boulevard, ) is now Natural Bridges State Beach, originally called Swanton Beach State Park.\n\n"}
{"id": "1796329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796329", "title": "Harry Gregg", "text": "Harry Gregg\n\nHenry Gregg, (27 October 1932 – 16 February 2020) was a Northern Irish professional footballer and manager. A goalkeeper, he played for Manchester United during the reign of Sir Matt Busby, with a total of 247 appearances for the club. He was a survivor of the Munich air disaster in 1958. Gregg also played for Doncaster Rovers and Stoke City, as well as making 25 appearances for the Northern Ireland national team between 1954 and 1963, including at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He later went into management with Carlisle United, Crewe Alexandra, Shrewsbury Town and Swansea City.\n\nGregg was born in Magherafelt, County Londonderry. While working as an apprentice joiner, he started his football career with Windsor Park Swifts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club, Coleraine. At the age of 18, he earned a move across the Irish Sea to Doncaster Rovers. In December 1957, he transferred to Manchester United for £23,500, at the time a world-record fee for a goalkeeper.\n\nHe is sometimes referred to as \"The Hero of Munich\" for his actions in the aftermath of the Munich air disaster, pulling his teammates – including Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and Dennis Viollet – from the burning plane. Among others he helped were Vera Lukić, the pregnant wife of a Yugoslav diplomat and her two-year-old daughter, Vesna, as well as his badly injured manager, Matt Busby. George Best, who used to clean Gregg's boots, said, \"Bravery is one thing but what Harry did was about more than bravery. It was about goodness.\"\n\nGregg played in United's first match after the disaster, a FA Cup fifth round tie with Sheffield Wednesday. United won 3–0 and went on to reach the 1958 FA Cup Final, which they lost 2–0 to Bolton Wanderers. The second goal in the final was scored in controversial fashion as Nat Lofthouse barged Gregg, and the ball with him, into the goal. United finished ninth in the league that season, as their league form declined after losing so many players in the Munich tragedy.\n\nHe was unable to earn a winners' medal with United, despite playing for the club during a successful period. He was ruled out of the 1963 FA Cup Final victory due to a shoulder injury, and a succession of injuries meant that he could not play enough games to qualify for a league championship medal in the 1964–65 season, and he was sold during the first half of their title-winning campaign in 1966–67. They finished runners-up to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1959. During his United career, Gregg kept 48 clean sheets in 247 appearances.\n\nGregg was transferred to Stoke City in December 1966. He played twice for Stoke, with mixed success; in his first match, he conceded four against Leicester City as Stoke lost 4–2, and then kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Blackpool. He retired at the end of the 1966–67 season.\n\nGregg won 25 caps for the Northern Ireland national team. He made his international debut in March 1954, playing against Wales. Gregg featured as Northern Ireland won 3–2 against England at Wembley in November 1957, and helped them qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was voted the best goalkeeper of the tournament, in which Northern Ireland reached the quarter-finals.\n\nIn 1968, he was appointed manager of Shrewsbury Town. In November 1972, he became manager of Swansea City, resigning in February 1975 to join Crewe Alexandra where he remained until 1978. He then had a spell as goalkeeper coach with his old team Manchester United at the invitation of Dave Sexton, where he stayed until Sexton left in 1981.\n\nHis next club was Swindon Town, as assistant manager to Lou Macari. Macari used a direct style of play, which Gregg disapproved of, and they were both sacked by Swindon in April 1985 after the disagreement between the pair became public. Macari was reinstated after a fan protest, and went on to lead Swindon to the Fourth Division title in 1986. Gregg then joined Carlisle United, initially working for manager Bob Stokoe. During the 1986–87 season Gregg succeeded Stokoe as Carlisle manager, but he was unable to prevent them from suffering relegation to the Fourth Division. Gregg left Carlisle during the autumn of 1987.\n\nGregg appeared in a number of television programmes about Manchester United and the Munich air disaster, including \"Munich: End of a Dream\" – a 1998 documentary that marked the 40th anniversary of the crash. On the 50th anniversary of the air crash he appeared in the documentary \"One Life: Munich Air Disaster\", broadcast 6 February 2008 on the BBC, in which he returned to the scene of the crash and the hospital for the first time and also met the son of Mrs Lukić, with whom she was pregnant at the time of the disaster. He expressed disappointment at never having been able to meet Mr Lukić, who had died in 2007. He was portrayed by actor Ben Peel in a 2011 BBC film, \"United\", which was centred around the Munich air disaster.\n\nGregg made an emotional account of the disaster on a TV programme entitled \"Munich Air Disaster: I Was There\" on the National Geographic Channel. In particular it centres around a personal journey for a reunion with Vera Lukić, a Serbian woman (the wife of a Yugoslav diplomat), whom Gregg saved from the wreckage, as well as Vera's baby daughter Vesna. Unknown to Gregg, Vera was also pregnant at the time of the disaster, so Gregg also rescued another life, that of Vera's son Zoran. Gregg was shown meeting Zoran in the documentary \"One Life: Munich Air Disaster\".\n\nIn April 2015, the feature-length documentary \"Spirit of '58\" was screened as part of the Belfast Film Festival. It featured interviews with the five surviving members of the Northern Ireland 1958 World Cup squad (Gregg, Billy Bingham, Peter McParland, Jimmy McIlroy and Billy Simpson), as it told the story of their journey throughout the 1950s under the management of Peter Doherty, culminating in the 1958 World Cup.\n\nGregg married his first wife, Mavis Markham, at St James's Church, Doncaster, in 1957, while still a Doncaster Rovers player. Their first child, Linda, was born later that year. A second daughter, Karen, was born a year later. Mavis died of cancer in 1961. On 2 July 1965 Gregg married Carolyn Maunders at St Mary's Parish Church, Rostherne. They had four children: Julie, Jane, Suzanne and John-Henry. He suffered a further tragedy on 24 April 2009, when his daughter Karen died of cancer at the age of 50. Gregg's uncle was the grandfather of fellow footballer Steve Lomas, who played for clubs including Manchester City and West Ham United, and managed the likes of St Johnstone and Millwall.\n\nGregg once owned the Windsor Hotel in the town of Portstewart, on the north coast of County Londonderry.\n\nGregg played for an under-18 team from Coleraine in a Ramelton Cup match during the 1950s. In May 2011, Gregg - then aged 78 - agreed to go back to Ramelton (in County Donegal) where he spent an evening, alongside Jobby Crossan, with local people in Ramelton Community Hall.\n\nGregg celebrated his time at Old Trafford on 15 May 2012 with a testimonial organised by John White and John Dempsey from the George Best Carryduff Manchester United SC. The testimonial featured Manchester United playing an Irish League Select XI managed by Martin O'Neill and David Jeffrey. The match ended 4–1 to Manchester United.\n\nGregg died on 16 February 2020, aged 87, after several weeks of illness, at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.\n\n\nGregg was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1995, and made an Officer of the Order (OBE) for services to football in the 2019 New Year Honours.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, Gregg was made an Honorary Graduate of the University of Ulster and awarded a Doctor of the University (DUniv) in recognition of his contribution to football at their Summer Graduation Ceremony.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n"}
{"id": "1796330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796330", "title": "Idlewild (band)", "text": "Idlewild (band)\n\nIdlewild are a Scottish rock band formed in Edinburgh in 1995. The band's line-up consists of Roddy Woomble (lead vocals), Rod Jones (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Newton (drums), Andrew Mitchell (bass), Allan Stewart (guitar) and Luciano Rossi (keyboards). To date, Idlewild have released nine full-length studio albums.\n\nInitially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material—once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on \"The Remote Part\" and \"Warnings/Promises\".\n\nIn 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to record their seventh album, \"Everything Ever Written\", released in 2015. This was followed by \"Interview Music\" in 2019.\n\nIdlewild, named after the quiet meeting place in \"Anne of Green Gables\", formed in December 1995 in Edinburgh, Scotland when a 19-year-old Roddy Woomble met drummer Colin Newton at a party. The two discovered that they had much in common, including similar musical interests and record collections. By the end of the night, they had discussed forming a band together. On the same night, the two were introduced to guitarist Rod Jones and the three kept in contact afterwards, meeting up to listen to music. Soon, the trio began writing songs together, and, in need of a bassist, they brought Phil Scanlon into the fold, due to the fact that he owned a bass guitar.\n\nIdlewild played their first show on 16 January 1996, at the Subway Club in Edinburgh to a crowd of thirty friends, which led to many more shows around Edinburgh throughout the course of the year. In May 1996 the band, now with over twenty songs written, entered Split Level Studios to record. The tape of these recordings earned the band many bookings at various venues around Scotland, including Glasgow. Local publications that heard the tape reviewed it favourably.\n\nPhil Scanlon decided to leave the band in February 1997 to concentrate on his studies. Since leaving Idlewild, he has become a highly successful chemical engineer and currently resides outside San Francisco. Woomble asked Bob Fairfoull to replace the departing bassist. Fairfoull had been present at every Idlewild show since the middle of 1996, and had impressed the others with his spoken-word, solo acoustic shows as well as his performances with Edinburgh band, Pussy Hoover. Fairfoull's debut with the band took place on 28 February at Glasgow bar, Nice N' Sleazy's.\n\nThe band's debut single \"Queen of the Troubled Teens\" was released on 17 March 1997, and built upon the chaotic reputation of their shows. Along with 'Self Healer', 'Satan Polaroid' and 'A Film for the Future', the song was included in a live session on Jeff Cooper's show 'XS' (now Radio2XS) on Sheffield's Hallam FM. It was also supported by BBC Radio Scotland DJ Peter Easton, and influential Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq was particularly impressed with the track \"Self Healer\" and asked, on the air, that if anyone knew anything about the band, they should contact him. In the summer of 1997, Idlewild played their first London shows which were attended by the likes of Lamacq, and representatives from Deceptive Records. Reviews at this time, in the pages of \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\" compared their live gigs to \"a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\". The band were soon asked to record a single for Fierce Panda and to record an EP/mini-album with Deceptive Records. In October 1997, the band spent six days with producer Paul Tipler in South London. The result was \"Captain\", which the band describes as \"an innocent, frank nugget of noise pop magic\". After the release of the \"Chandelier\" single, the band signed a deal with Food Records/EMI in December. Following the record deal, the members quit their respective jobs or university courses.\n\n1998 marked the year where the public became actively aware of Idlewild, who kicked off the year with their first UK tour, supporting the band Midget. The release of \"Captain\", on 18 January, received positive reviews in the \"NME\", \"Melody Maker\" and \"Kerrang!\". In February the band re-entered the studio, again with Paul Tipler, to record their first full-length album for Food Records. Two singles were released before the album's release, \"A Film for the Future\" (compared to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by one journalist) and \"Everyone Says You're So Fragile\". Both singles helped to expand the band's growing fanbase alongside notable appearances at summer festivals. October marked the arrival of their debut album \"Hope Is Important\" which the band now describes as \"a confused, skewered, noisy, sad pop record\". Further singles from the album included, \"I'm a Message\" and fan favourite, \"When I Argue I See Shapes\". Tours supporting Ash, Placebo and Manic Street Preachers followed the release.\n\nIdlewild eventually returned to Edinburgh in 1999 to begin writing new songs, and contacted engineer Bob Weston, from Chicago, who recorded six songs with them in London. These songs held a more aggressive, emptier sound than those previously, and the band were pleased with the results; however, they remained unsure of their direction. During the summer, Idlewild were invited to play at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, a momentous day for Scottish history. Scotland is where the band would remain for a while, letting the surrounding environment influence their songwriting and letting the songs represent the band as they were. Hitting a stride, the band returned to the studio with producer Dave Eringa and recorded \"Little Discourage\" and \"Roseability\" in their first session. Very happy with the results, the band continued to record what would become their second full-length album, \"100 Broken Windows\". The song \"Little Discourage\" was released in September and brought Idlewild a larger fan-base and much more radio play. \"Hope Is Important\" was released in America, and to support it, the band performed a small number of tour dates on the East Coast. The remainder of the year was spent mixing the new album in Glasgow.\n\nIn March the following year, the band released \"Actually it's Darkness\" and embarked on their biggest UK tour to date. Jeremy Mills joined the band on tour, playing guitar and keyboards. Their sound had now evolved from simplistic punk-rock to a more mature sound resembling R.E.M., Echo & the Bunnymen, and The Smiths. \"100 Broken Windows\" reached silver status in the UK and the band went on tour in Europe and North America. Further singles released from the album included \"These Wooden Ideas\" and \"Roseability\".\n\nAs 2001 began, the band re-entered the studio, this time with producer Stephen Street, to record songs written in the last half of 2000. While happy with the results the band put their next album aside to tour America. American music magazine Spin named \"100 Broken Windows\" the \"number one album you didn't hear in 2000\" and the album received other rave reviews in the American press on its release in April. Whilst touring the album in America, Allan Stewart replaced Jeremy Mills as touring guitarist. Readers of The Skinny magazine in Scotland would retrospectively vote 100 Broken Windows 'The Scottish Album of the Decade' in December 2009.\n\nIdlewild eventually moved up to the highlands of Scotland and began the writing and demoing process of what would become \"The Remote Part\". Both Allan and Jeremy joined the band in a cottage in Inchnadamph, Sutherland. Woomble began a friendship with Scottish Makar (poet laureate) Edwin Morgan who would eventually end up on the song \"Scottish Fiction,\" the album's closing track. The remainder of the year was spent recording and mixing the album in various locations with producer Dave Eringa. This period marked the band's longest absence from performing.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"You Held the World in Your Arms\", became 'A-listed' on Radio One and entered the UK Singles Chart at number nine, marking the band's biggest hit to date. A UK tour followed with Ikara Colt supporting and a second single, \"American English\", was released. On release, \"The Remote Part\" entered the album charts at number three, and was considered a record of considerable depth, as well as one of the most melodic records of the year. The album went gold in the UK and a third single, \"Live in a Hiding Place\", was released as the band embarked upon a four-month European tour in September, which included supporting dates with Coldplay.\n\nOn 29 September, Bob Fairfoull left the band, following a show in Amsterdam. Fairfoull had become increasingly distant from the band over the past year. The band and Fairfoull remain friends, and Bob now plays bass with Edinburgh-based band Degrassi and Paper Beats Rock. Longtime Irish friend, Gavin Fox, joined the band as his replacement, while touring guitarist, Allan Stewart, became a permanent member of the band. While Fox learned his parts in Dublin, technician and friend Alex Grant filled in to assist the band.\n\n2002 was Idlewild's most successful year, with \"The Remote Part\" entering many 'Best of the Year' lists.\n\nWith Gavin and Allan officially in the band, Idlewild spent January of the following year writing songs and practising in an old lighthouse outside Edinburgh. A final single from \"The Remote Part\", \"A Modern Way of Letting Go\", introduced the new line-up to the UK via several television appearances and another short tour of Britain and Ireland.\n\n\"The Remote Part\" received its US release in March 2003 and the band embarked upon a cross-continent, nine-week headline tour playing their biggest US shows in New York City and Los Angeles. The band then returned to America in May at the request of Pearl Jam, who asked the band to open one leg of their \"Riot Act\" world tour. These were the biggest venues Idlewild had played in, and they found friends in Pearl Jam, even playing with them onstage on the final night in Chicago. Subsequently, in June 2007 Pearl Jam requested Idlewild to support them for a one-off date at Wembley Arena.\n\nAs 2004 began, Idlewild spent the first four months of the year writing and demoing new songs up in the Scottish Highlands, and in Roddy's flat in London. The band chose to work with American producer Tony Hoffer and flew out to Los Angeles and spent the next three months recording and mixing the new songs. This marked the first time Idlewild had recorded an album all in one go.\n\nThe band finished up the record in October 2004 in New York with mixer Michael Brauer. Roddy rented a room on the Lower East Side and stayed there for the remainder of the year, listening to the album they'd just made. 2004 became the first in the band's existence devoted almost entirely to writing and recording an album. At the end of this year they titled it \"Warnings/Promises\".\n\n2005 began with a series of acoustic shows around the UK. The first single from \"Warnings/Promises\", entitled \"Love Steals Us from Loneliness\", appeared in February and became Idlewild's fourth Top 20 single. The album followed two weeks later and debuted within the UK Top Ten. \"Warnings/Promises\" received mainly positive reviews; however, some critics and fans disliked the band's direction with this album.\n\nIn the UK, the band embarked upon an extensive UK tour, changing the setlist every night and revisiting songs from each of their albums. In the summer, Idlewild played a number of festivals and opened shows for U2, R.E.M. and the Pixies.\n\nIn November, the band announced that they had parted ways with their record company Parlophone after fulfilling their contractual obligation over eight years, leaving them without a record deal. However, despite rumours that they were breaking up, the band claimed that they were looking forward to the future.\n\nThe year ended with a Christmas show at Barrowlands, a famed Glasgow venue and the band's \"spiritual home\". After this gig, Gavin Fox left the band and was replaced by former Astrid bassist Gareth Russell.\n\nIn July 2006, Roddy Woomble released an album of folk music under his own name titled \"My Secret is My Silence\". Woomble's solo material was written alongside Rod Jones, friend Michael Angus and folksinger Karine Polwart, and produced by folk musician John McCusker. Roddy toured the album in July and August. Jones meanwhile worked on an album with Inara George called \"George Is Jones\"\n\nThe band spent many months writing new material, which was recorded with \"100 Broken Windows\" and \"The Remote Part\" producer Dave Eringa in their rehearsal room.\n\nIn July 2006, it was announced Idlewild would sign to 1960s label Sequel, which was reactivated by music group Sanctuary.\n\nThe album \"Make Another World\" was released on 5 March 2007. \"If It Takes You Home\" was the first single released from it and was available as a download and 7\" single. \"No Emotion\" was the second single released; it went to No. 36 in the UK Top 40 chart. \"A Ghost in the Arcade\" was the next single, released on 18 June, though only as an internet-downloadable track and not available on physical CD.\n\nAt the 19 March 2007 Aberdeen concert on the Make Another World UK Tour, Woomble announced the show was being filmed for a live DVD release (included with the special edition of the band's greatest hits album \"Scottish Fiction - Best of 1997-2007\"). The band played a twenty-three song setlist which included a considerable number of songs from earlier albums such as \"Hope is Important\". It was at this gig that the video for \"A Ghost in the Arcade\" was filmed.\n\nDuring their 16 May gig in The Liquid Room, Edinburgh, Woomble announced an Idlewild 'Greatest Hits' compilation would be released later in the year at the request of former label Parlophone. \"Scottish Fiction - Best of 1997-2007\" was released on 1 October 2007 by Parlophone and is a 17 track 'best of' compilation featuring career highlights, and includes the aforementioned DVD.\n\nA second compilation album was also released on 29 October. \"A Distant History - Rarities 1997-2007\" included the band's early singles as well as many B-sides and was available only through download stores.\n\nThe band continued to play more gigs while working on their next album. Meanwhile, Woomble started writing a column for Scottish newspaper The Sunday Herald and released an album with Kris Drever and John McCusker, entitled \"Before the Ruin\", in September 2008.\n\nIn December 2008 the band played five shows at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, playing each of their studio albums in full. Roddy Woomble noted that the band were \"going to try to play every track [they'd] ever written – including B-sides – which has to be more than 100 songs.\" In February 2009, they announced that they would be staging a similar residency at Dingwalls in Camden, London.\n\nA new song, \"City Hall\", appeared in a setlist, and the band entered the studio in January 2009. On his online diary, Roddy Woomble noted that he had: \"been trying to work on lyrics for the new Idlewild record. At the moment it has the possibility of being about anything, so I've been trying to narrow that down a bit. I've been re-reading Jack Kerouac's novels and following this US election, and keeping up with all the new US groups, so maybe it'll take on a Stars and stripes theme. It'll probably end up being about mountains and Islands though.\"\n\nOn 21 November the band sent an email to fans on the mailing list offering them a chance to preorder the new album (along with \"exclusive packaging & including at least one bonus track\") to be \"shipped within weeks of completion\". All fans who bought the album this way would also have their name appear in the CD booklet and on a roll call on the band's official website. On 9 May 2009, Roddy confirmed in his online diary that the new album would be entitled \"Post Electric Blues\". The album was performed in full on 19 May.\n\nInitial emails indicated a release date to fans who had pre-ordered the album of mid-April, but the album was eventually mailed out on 10 June 2009. Fans who pre-ordered the album were also allowed to download their choice of live tracks that the band had recorded at the King Tut's series of shows. The album was officially released in October, preceded by the single \"Readers & Writers\". In April 2010, Woomble announced that the band would enter a hiatus following the band's tour in support of \"Post Electric Blues\". However this comment only referred to the writing and recording of new material as Woomble later suggested. Idlewild announced their first American tour since 2005 and a short UK tour in support of the EMI re-release of \"100 Broken Windows\". During the UK shows (as well as a New York and Los Angeles show) the album was to be played in its entirety. However, due to an injury to Rod Jones, the American dates were cancelled. The \"100 Broken Windows\" reissue was released on 8 November 2010 and featured a second disc of B-Sides and unreleased material.\n\nIn September 2013, rumours of a reunion began as the band posted a photo on their official Facebook page with the caption \"What's going on here...?\" Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Woomble confirmed that the band were in the process of writing a new album, stating: \"I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and it is no secret that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but they will be in time, as will others.\" In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Luciano Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.\n\nThe band announced the release of their seventh studio album \"Everything Ever Written\" on 3 November 2014 on the BBC 6 Music Steve Lamacq show, debuting the new single \"Collect Yourself\".\n\nIn February 2019 mailing list recipients received notification of a new Idlewild album to pre-order on multiple formats as well as a tour of the UK in the Spring. The new album, \"Interview Music\", was released on 5 April.\n\nJones released his debut solo album, \"A Sentimental Education\", in 2009. In 2010, Jones founded The Fruit Tree Foundation, alongside Emma Pollock (The Delgados), in order to raise awareness of mental health problems. Jones released his second solo album, \"A Generation Innocence\", in August 2012; however, while writing for the second album, Jones encountered a hurdle at the halfway mark, as he discovered that he was not satisfied with any of the material that he had written thus far. In 2011, Jones explained, \"I was a bit fed up with the whole folk music thing – I mean every man and his dog was doing the faux folk thing\"—Jones then proceeded to learn the drums and eventually formed the band, The Birthday Suit, to record the material that he had created in the period following the drumming diversion.\n\nIn late 2011, Jones formed The Birthday Suit and described the band as \"essentially a solo project ... It's an ever-changing bistro of musicians.\" The band released its debut album, \"The Eleventh Hour\", in October 2011. The Birthday Suit's second studio album, \"A Conversation Well Rehearsed\" was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the \"Clean Slate Music\" website's \"Top 21 Albums of 2012\" list, although the website wrote that the second album \"doesn't carry the punch\" of the band's debut album.\n\nIn 2006, Woomble worked with several musicians including Kate Rusby, his wife Ailidh Lennon, songwriter Karine Polwart (to whom he presented the Horizon Award at the BBC Folk Awards 2005, and with whom he performed at Celtic Connections) and Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones on his debut solo album \"My Secret is My Silence\", produced by John McCusker. The album was released in July 2006, and Woomble toured the United Kingdom in support of the album's release. \"My Secret is my Silence\" reached number one in the UK Folk Charts, and a year later, on 10 July 2007, \"My Secret is my Silence\" was released in the United States on 7–10 Music. Woomble's follow-up album, \"Before the Ruin\", written and recorded with Kris Drever and John McCusker, was released on 15 September 2008 through Navigator Records. In March 2011, Woomble released his second solo album, \"The Impossible Song & Other Songs\".\n\n\n\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n"}

{"id": "1796355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796355", "title": "WJAR", "text": "WJAR\n\nWJAR, virtual channel 10 (UHF digital channel 25), branded on-air as NBC 10, is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Providence, Rhode Island, United States and also serving New Bedford, Massachusetts. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. WJAR's studios are located on Kenney Drive in Cranston, Rhode Island, and its transmitter is located in Rehoboth, Massachusetts.\n\nWJAR-TV signed on for the first time on July 10, 1949, broadcasting on channel 11. It was Rhode Island's first television station and the fourth in New England. It was owned by The Outlet Company, a department store chain headquartered in Providence, along with WJAR radio (AM 920, now WHJJ; and FM 95.5, now occupied by WLVO). In 1952, after hearing about repeated instances of interference in Connecticut between WJAR-TV and New York City's WPIX (also on channel 11), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s \"Sixth Report and Order\" changed the television allocations for Providence and forced the station to move to channel 10, which it did in the spring of 1953. At that time, WJAR's coverage area increased, since the interference with WPIX had been rectified.\n\nWJAR-TV initially carried programming from all four networks of the time (NBC, ABC, DuMont, and CBS), but has always been a primary NBC affiliate due to WJAR radio's long affiliation with NBC Radio. Despite this, WJAR only carried a little more than half of NBC's program schedule during its early years on the air; WJAR also broadcast about half of the CBS network schedule and a couple of shows each from ABC and DuMont every week. It lost ABC in 1953 when WNET-TV (channel 16, now WNAC-TV on channel 64) signed on, and lost CBS in 1955 when WPRO-TV (now WPRI-TV) launched. When WNET-TV went dark in 1956, WJAR shared ABC programming with WPRO-TV until WTEV (now WLNE-TV) signed on in 1963. During the late 1950s, WJAR-TV was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. In 1954, WJAR-TV received national attention for its coverage of Hurricane Carol; newsreel films shot by WJAR cameramen of the storm and its aftermath not only appeared on the station, but also fed to CBS and NBC for use on their evening news programs.\n\nFor many years in the 1970s, WJAR-TV broadcast men's basketball games of Providence College and the University of Rhode Island, with Chris Clark calling play-by-play. In the early 1970s, when PC was one of the top teams in the country (and the top college basketball team in New England), their home games at the newly opened Providence Civic Center were often sellouts, despite the fact that WJAR televised many of these home games live.\n\nIn November 1980, the Outlet Company left the department store business to concentrate on broadcasting. A year earlier, the station moved its studios from the Outlet Building to a three-story modern production facility next door. The department store remained standing until 1986, when it burned to the ground in a spectacular fire. WJAR cameras perched on the neighboring rooftop captured the most dramatic footage. In April 1993, the station's studios were moved to their current location in an industrial area of Cranston just south of Providence. Three years later, Outlet Communications merged with NBC, making WJAR the second network-owned station in the market (CBS owned WPRI-TV for parts of 1995 and 1996 before it was forced to sell the station to Clear Channel Communications after CBS and Westinghouse merged due to a significant signal overlap with WBZ-TV).\n\nIn April 1997, WJAR began to operate WB affiliate WLWC (which was owned by Fant Broadcasting) under a local marketing agreement (LMA). Even by the time that station signed on, the future of the LMA was in doubt given the fact that NBC, which inherited the arrangement from Outlet, did not want to run stations outside their core owned-and-operated outlets. The network, during this time, pushed Fant to sell WLWC. In September 1997, NBC came up with a three-way swap in which Fant exchanged WLWC and sister station WWHO in Columbus, Ohio to Paramount/Viacom for that group's NBC affiliate in Hartford, Connecticut, WVIT.\n\nWJAR was one of four NBC O&Os in smaller markets that were put up for sale on January 9, 2006, along with stations in Columbus, Birmingham, Alabama, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Except for the Birmingham station, these were also once owned by Outlet. On April 6, 2006, NBC Universal and Media General announced that Media General would purchase WJAR as part of a $600 million four station deal between the two companies. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 26. As a result, WJAR became Media General's first television station in New England. For all intents and purposes, this undid the NBC-Outlet merger a decade earlier.\n\nIn its earliest days, WJAR's logo included a Rhode Island Red rooster, the state bird of Rhode Island. Prior to WJAR's purchase by NBC, it had included various versions of a different stylized \"10\" above the WJAR call letters. This had been in effect for the previous twenty years. The stylized \"10\" was initially retained after the purchase, but with the NBC peacock attached to the right-hand side and the call letters removed. This was dropped in 2002 in favor of an \"NBC 10\" logo first used on former sister station WCAU in Philadelphia. A modified version, used on newscasts starting in 2007, was designed and arranged similarly to other Media General station logos. In February 2014, both versions of that logo were replaced with the station's current logo.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, LIN Media entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN already owned CBS affiliate WPRI and operates Fox affiliate WNAC-TV, and the two stations rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Providence market in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either WJAR or WPRI-TV to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit sharing agreements; the grandfathered LMA involving WNAC was included in the sale but remained with WPRI-TV due to the grandfathered status. On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would keep WPRI and the LMA with WNAC and sell WJAR, along with WLUK-TV and WCWF in Green Bay and WTGS in Savannah, Georgia, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group in exchange for KXRM-TV and KXTU-LD in Colorado Springs and WTTA in Tampa Bay.\nThe sale was completed on December 19, marking Sinclair's return to owning a Providence market station after a year and a half, as it owned WLWC from January 2012 until April 2013.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn January 2009, WJAR began broadcasting the Retro Television Network on its second digital channel and digital cable. WJAR-DT2 had previously carried NBC Weather Plus. WJAR replaced RTV with MeTV on September 26, 2011, as part of a groupwide affiliation agreement with Media General; the channel replaced RTV on some Media General-owned stations in other markets.\n\nWJAR discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on February 17, 2009, the original date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 51, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 10. This allowed ShopNBC station WWDP to begin operation of its permanent digital facility on channel 10.\n\nWJAR has traditionally been available in many other Massachusetts municipalities outside Bristol County, mainly in Plymouth County and Cape Cod. On December 8, 2011, cable operator Comcast had to move WJAR off channel 10 outside Bristol County, because WWDP notified them that they wanted to be carried on channel 10. Comcast was forced to comply due to federal must-carry laws.\n\nAs a result, WJAR can also be seen in many non-Bristol County towns and cities on the following channels (provider varies between Xfinity and Verizon Fios):\n\nChannel 96: Abington, Bourne, Bridgewater, Brockton, Carver, Duxbury, East Bridgewater, Falmouth, Halifax, Hanson, Holbrook, Kingston, Marshfield, Martha's Vineyard, Plymouth, Plympton, Sandwich, West Bridgewater, and Whitman.\n\nChannel 97: Barnstable, Brewster, Chatham, Dennis, Eastham, Harwich, Mashpee, Nantucket, Orleans, Provincetown, Truro, Wellfleet, and Yarmouth.\n\nChannel 99: Bellingham, Blackstone, Canton, Foxboro, Franklin, Hopedale, Lakeville, Marion, Medfield, Mendon, Middleborough, Milford, Norfolk, Norwood, Sharon, Wareham, and Wrentham.\n\nOn May 2, 2012, WJAR partnered with Cox Communications to launch Ocean State Networks (OSN). This channel replaces NewsChannel 5 (formerly the Rhode Island News Channel), operated by Cox and WLNE-TV from November 30, 1998 until February 1, 2012, when WJAR programming first appeared on the channel. OSN airs NBC 10 newscasts throughout the day and night, as well as Cox Sports programming, including live local high school and collegiate sports events. Teams featured on OSN include the Pawtucket Red Sox, Providence Friars, Rhode Island Rams, and the Rhode Island Interscholastic League. The channel is exclusively available to Cox Cable subscribers on channel 5 and in high-definition on channel 1005. As a result of the launch of OSN, Cox Sports (channels 3 and HD 1003) was removed from the lineup, with all programming being moved to OSN.\n\nIn addition to its local newscasts, WJAR clears the entire NBC network schedule, though during the late 1970s up to 1995, WJAR preempted NBC's noon programming for their noon newscast. Syndicated programming on WJAR includes \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" (which delays the fourth hour of \"Today\"), \"Dateline\", \"Extra\", and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" among others.\n\nWJAR broadcasts 37½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, 3½ hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WJAR has been the far-and-away ratings leader in the Providence–New Bedford market. WPRI is consistently in second place, while WLNE has usually been a distant third. This can be attributed to WJAR being the state's oldest station, as well as its association with its well established radio sisters. In all four Nielsen ratings periods in 2016, the station was number one in all time slots.\n\nIn mid-1988, WJAR broke a tradition in its market: it began broadcasting news on weekdays at 5:30 p.m. with \"The 5:30 Report\" (renamed in 1992 as \"Up-front at 5:30\"), that included the top stories of the day, plus a cooking segment, weather and entertainment news. It was expanded to one hour in January 1995, and was restructured as a conventional newscast.\n\nIn 2000, WJAR's news opens started off with \"Thank you for turning to 10\" before opening their newscasts. However, it was dropped in 2008.\n\nOn two occasions, WJAR has produced a prime time newscast at 10. The first began in April 1997 (entitled \"TV 28 News at 10\") and was seen weeknights on WLWC in competition to the WPRI-produced show on Fox affiliate WNAC-TV. The broadcast was dropped that September when the LMA with WLWC ended. The second attempt has been airing on weeknights since October 1, 2007 when the station began producing \"NBC 10 News 10 at 10\" on its NBC Weather Plus digital subchannel. It was originally a live ten-minute production consisting of top stories of the day along with an updated weather forecast.\n\nWhen WJAR-DT2 switched to RTV, the show expanded to a half-hour and was renamed \"NBC 10 News 10 at 10 on RTV\". A new segment was added called \"Flashback\" which features vintage footage of past personnel. WLNE occasionally aired news at that time when it operated Cox channel 5 as NewsChannel 5, primarily when sports preempted WNAC's newscast. On September 6, 2010, WJAR began airing the area's second newscast weeknights at 7 joining WLNE. However, it also airs on Saturday nights unlike the other channel's weeknight production. WLNE's newscast was officially canceled in April 2011.\n\nWJAR is notable for having employed three \"Today Show\" personalities. Former \"Today\" hosts Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira worked at WJAR. Vieira started out as a reporter on the station in the late-1970s while Lauer was co-host of WJAR's version of \"PM Magazine\" in the early-1980s. In 2012, former WJAR meteorologist Dylan Dreyer became began doing weekend weather on \"Today\". Other notable alumni include CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour and ESPN anchor Steve Berthiaume. In 2008, WJAR was awarded the National Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence for a small-market television station. In 2010, the station's website won a second national Murrow. In 2011, the station won its third national Murrow in a row, this time in the \"Breaking News\" category for its coverage of recent historic flooding. In 2012, the station's web site won a regional Edward R. Murrow Award.\n\nOn May 16, 2011, WJAR became the first station in the Providence market to air newscasts in high-definition. A new set was constructed for the transition to HD and debuted on \"NBC 10 News Sunrise\" that morning. Photos of the set as it was being built were posted on the station's Facebook page. During construction, newscasts were broadcast from a temporary set in the station's \"Studio B\". Several technological upgrades were also made.\nIn addition to its main studios, WJAR operates two news bureaus. The Bay State Newsroom is located at the old \"Standard Times\" building on Pleasant Street in New Bedford. The Downcity Bureau is on Dorrance Street in Downtown Providence. The station uses a live weather radar feed from the National Weather Service's Local Forecast Office on Myles Standish Boulevard in Taunton, Massachusetts.\n\nIn June 2015, after being sold to Sinclair, they brought back the \"Thank you for turning to 10\" before opening their newscasts when the Sinclair graphics debuted. However, it was dropped again on September 23, 2019. \n\n\n"}

At the time of her death, she was eighth on the all-time list of longest-serving soap opera actors in the United States. She was the mother of three children, the eldest being actor Corbin Bernsen.\n\nCooper was born in Taft, California, to Albert Troy Cooper, and his wife, the former Sildeth Evelyn Moore. She was the youngest of three siblings. The family lived in Kern County for several years, first in Taft until 1942 and then moving to Bakersfield. Her mother died August 21, 1944, and her father died April 11, 1986.\n\nCooper began her career in the 1950s, appearing as a supporting player in films with stars like Maureen O'Hara, Glenn Ford, Tony Curtis, and Henry Fonda. Her first film role was as Myra in the 1953 western film, \"The Redhead from Wyoming\". She later appeared in small roles in \"The Man from the Alamo\", \"Over-Exposed\", \"5 Steps to Danger\", \"Rock All Night\", \"House of Women\", \"13 West Street\", \"The Intruder\", \"Black Zoo\", \"The Glory Guys\", \"Tony Rome\", \"The Boston Strangler\" and \"Kansas City Bomber\".\n\nCooper was a fixture on episodic television throughout the 1950s and 1970s. In 1956, she was cast as Mrs. Hinton in \"The Rabbi Davis Story\" of the religious anthology series, \"Crossroads\". That same year, she portrayed Louise Douglas in \"Girl Bandit\" of Broderick Crawford's syndicated crime drama, \"Highway Patrol\". She also appeared in the Wagon Train episode titled \"The Whipping\"and as Marie Conover in the 1967 \"Cheyenne\" episode titled \"Top Hand\".\n\nCooper played Ann Dix in the 1955 episode \"I Am Joaquin\" of the syndicated western anthology series, \"Death Valley Days,\" hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Ann searches with ultimate success for eight years for the return of her young daughter whom the Mexican bandit Joaquin Murrieta (Cliff Fields) left at a Roman Catholic church after he boarded a ship and stabbed to death the girl's father, Capt. Stephen Dix, played by John Damler (1919-1984).\n\nIn 1957, she starred in one of the early episodes of two different western series, NBC's \"Tales of Wells Fargo\", in the role of the woman bandit Belle Starr, and on ABC’s Maverick; in 1959, she portrayed Duchess in a second \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" episode, \"Clay Allison\". In 1958, she was cast in the episode \"Wheel of Fortune\" of the NBC western series, \"Jefferson Drum\", starring Jeff Richards as a newspaper publisher. Also in 1958, Cooper appeared as Lucy in \"Sundown at Bitter Creek\" of the CBS western anthology series, \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater\". In 1960, she again played Belle Starr in an episode of the TV series \"Bronco\" titled \"Shadow of Jesse James\".\n\nCooper made five guest appearances during the nine-year run of CBS's \"Perry Mason\", beginning with the role of Laura Beaumont in the 1958 episode, \"The Case of the Corresponding Corpse.\" In the final season of the show, she made her fifth and final appearance as defendant Miriam Fielding in the 1966 episode, \"The Case of the Vanishing Victim.\" \n\nIn 1962, Cooper earned her first Emmy nomination for her performance in \"Ben Casey\". After a turn as a regular on NBC's \"Bracken's World\". She was also cast in \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Hawaii Five-O\", \"Mannix\", \"Ironside\", \"Storefront Lawyers\", \"The Silent Force\", \"Touched by an Angel\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"The Untouchables\", and many other series.\n\nIn 1965, Cooper appeared in the ABC network's western television series, \"The Big Valley,\" as Elaine Baxter Jason, a mercantile store owner and an old friend of series character Victoria Barkley (Barbara Stanwyck). In another episode she appears as the money-hungry aunt of Heath (Lee Majors) . Her husband was portrayed in the episode by John Anderson, who years later became known as MacGyver's grandfather, Harry Jackson.\n\nCooper is best known for her role as Katherine Chancellor on the daytime soap opera \"The Young and the Restless\". Her character has broken ground in the daytime medium; Katherine has endured several bouts with alcoholism, ischemic stroke, \nand the loss of many men in her life (four late husbands, and a child given away after birth).\n\nIn 1984, Katherine (and Cooper) also had a facelift on national television (Cooper had pitched the idea of having a live facelift to CBS executives, who agreed to write the facelift into the show for Katherine Chancellor). For many years, the story of Katherine's bitter rivalry with character Jill Foster Abbott has been a mainstay of the show (in real life, Cooper and Jill's portrayer, Jess Walton, were close friends). It was revealed in 2003 that Jill was Katherine's daughter born out of wedlock, but developments in 2009 cast doubt upon that assertion and the long bitter enemies were found not to be mother and daughter after all.\n\nCooper received ten Daytime Emmy nominations, nine for Outstanding Lead Actress and one for Outstanding Supporting Actress, and two Primetime Emmy nominations. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Daytime Emmys in 2004. For her contributions to television, Cooper received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. She won the 2008 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. This was her first competitive win; she had first been nominated in 1989.\n\nCooper's character, Katherine, was thought to have died in a November 2008 episode. It was, however, her look-alike, Marge, who died, and Katherine had experienced memory issues due to the car accident that took Marge's life.\n\nCooper had to take a medical leave in October 2011 and her part on the soap was temporarily recast with veteran actress Michael Learned. However, the next month, she confirmed she was returning to the set. She returned as part of the show on December 23, 2011.\n\nShe filmed her last scene on the show in March on the same day as the \"Young and the Restless\" 40th anniversary and this scene aired on May 3, 2013, five days before her death.\n\nA tribute episode of \"The Young and the Restless\" in honor of Jeanne Cooper made up of clips, cast memories and interviews was shown on May 28 on the CBS network. Her character, Katherine, died offscreen a few months later after a long, worldwide trip.\n\nCooper married television producer Harry Bernsen, Jr., and they were together for 23 years before divorcing. In Jeanne Cooper's book (released on July 31, 2012), she makes it known that after their divorce, she and ex-husband Harry Bernsen very rarely saw each other (only when family functions dictated) and they were not close or even friends before his death on May 31, 2008. The Bernsens had three children, all of whom are actors: Corbin Bernsen of \"L.A.

Cooper died on May 8, 2013 in a Los Angeles hospital. In addition to infection, Cooper had been a heavy smoker most of her adult life and suffered from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her final Y&R scene was filmed Tuesday, March 26, 2013 (the exact date of Y&R's 40th anniversary) and aired on Friday, May 3, 2013. “Mom passed this morning”, her son, Corbin Bernsen, revealed on Twitter the day of her death. “She was in peace and without fear.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796364", "title": "First Families of Virginia", "text": "First Families of Virginia\n\nFirst Families of Virginia (FFV) were those families in Colonial Virginia who were socially prominent and wealthy, but not necessarily the earliest settlers. They descended from English colonists who primarily settled at Jamestown, Williamsburg, The Northern Neck and along the James River and other navigable waters in Virginia during the 17th century. These elite families generally married within their social class for many generations and, as a result, most surnames of First Families date to the colonial period.\n\nThe American Revolution cut ties with Britain but not with its social traditions. While some First Family members were loyal to Britain, others were Whigs who not only supported, but led the Revolution. Most First Families remained in Virginia, where they flourished as tobacco planters, and from the sale of slaves to the cotton states to the south. Indeed, many younger sons were relocated into the cotton belt to start their own plantations. The Civil War devastated the Virginia economy, and emancipated all the slaves without compensation. Planters and small farmers both were economically hurt, but in general the First Families, albeit poorer than before, maintained social and political leadership. Marshall Fishwick says that by the 1950s, \"the old-time aristocracy [had] not given up, or sunk into decadence as Southern novelists suggest.\" They adopted modern agricultural technology and co-opted rich \"Yankees\" into their upper-class, rural horse-estate society.\n\nEnglish colonists who formed the FFV emigrated to the new Colony of Virginia. Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the English Civil War and English Interregnum period (1642–1660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized Charles II as King following the execution of Charles I in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\" – a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia.\n\nMany such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\". Primogeniture favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited land grants or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America.\n\nIn some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the Spencer family of Bedfordshire and the Washington family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their Mount Vernon home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other.\n\nA thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\" writes British historian John Keegan, \"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\"\n\nThe ties among Virginia families were based on marriage. In a pre-Revolutionary War economy dependent on the production of tobacco as a commodity crop, the ownership of the best land was tightly controlled. It often passed between families of corresponding social rank. The Virginia economy was based on slave labor as the colony became a slave society. The landed gentry could keep tight rein on political power, which passed in somewhat orderly fashion from family to family. (In the more modern mercantile economy of the north, social mobility became more prominent. The power of the elite was muted by newcomers who gained wealth in the market economy.)\n\nPocahontas (1595–1617), a Native American, was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, founder of the Powhatan Confederacy. According to Mattaponi and Patawomeck tradition, Pocahontas was previously married to a Patawomeck \"weroance\", Kocoum, who was murdered by Englishmen when Samuel Argall abducted her on April 13, 1613. Educated among the English of Virginia and converted to Christianity during her captivity in Henricus, Pocahontas married colonist John Rolfe at a church in Jamestown on April 5, 1614. Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export cash crop for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, Thomas Rolfe, was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.\n\nPocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and Algonquian women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.\n\nIn 1887, following the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, Virginia Governor Wyndham Robertson wrote the first history of Pocahontas and her descendants, delineating the ancestry of FFV families including the Bollings, Clements, Whittles, Blands, Skipwiths, Flemings, Catletts, Gays, Jordans, Randolphs, Tazewells, and many others. Excluded from this history were 'natural children', mixed-race descendants of unions with slaves.\n\nFamilies often used surnames as given names, as in the \"Johns\" of Johns Hopkins University. A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"middle name\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the 38th Virginia Infantry, Confederate States Army was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.\n\nIn 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was held near Norfolk to celebrate the tricentennial of the arrival of the first English colonists and the founding of Jamestown. Preservation Virginia, formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was founded in Williamsburg in 1889 to memorialize Virginia history. In the 20th century, Preservation Virginia emphasized patriotism by highlighting the Founding Fathers that hailed from Virginia.\n\nSome notable family names include: \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1796369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796369", "title": "Foot drill", "text": "Foot drill\n\nFoot drill is a part of the training regimen of organized military and paramilitary elements worldwide. \"Foot drill\" or \"Drill\" stems from time since antiquity when soldiers would march into battle, be expected to gather in a formation, and react to words of command from their commanders once the battle commenced. Much of the drill done today is either ceremonial, or implemented as a core part of training in the Armed Forces. Military discipline is enhanced by drill, as it requires instant obedience to commands and synchronized completion of said commands with the others in the unit.\n\nDrill proved useful when marching formations of soldiers cross-country. For example, officers could form men from an eight-wide route march formation to a two-wide formation for passing through gates and other narrow passages, without losing time or cohesion. Drill was used to efficiently maneuver formations around and through obstacles.\n\nDrill was often used as a forerunner to great battles; during them it justified itself. It was also utilized after battles, where quick restoration of the corporate unity of an element was required.\n\nVegetius composed his treatise on the Roman Empire's military, \"De Re Militari\", at some point between 378 and 390 CE during the reign of Valentinian II in the Western Roman Empire. This work consists of three separate, yet related books, the first establishing methods of training and selecting new recruits, the second and third books a continuation of the first, describing in detail training and discipline matters as they pertained not only to the troops, but also to the leadership in times of training and battle, as well as positing an argument for reforms in the army.\n\nWithin these books can be found a detailed guide for drill of the army. Among these drills, the \"military step\" describes how initial training should consist of \"\"constant practice of marching quick and together. Nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line than that they should keep their ranks with the greatest exactness. For troops who march in an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger of being defeated. They should march with the common military step twenty miles in five summer-hours, and with the full step, which is quicker, twenty-four miles in the same number of hours. If they exceed this pace, they no longer march but run, and no certain rate can be assigned.\"\" \n\nDrill became less common after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the resultant disappearance of professional armies from Western Europe. In the Middle Ages the individualist nature of Knightly combat, focusing on individual skills and heroism, coupled with the ad-hoc nature of the supporting levies meant that there was no place for mass subordination of troops through Drill. The rise of the mercenary during the renaissance led to some level of military professionalisation: this led to co-ordinated and practiced military units such as the Swiss mercenaries but standardisation was still lacking.\n\nThe mass use of firearms in the later 16th Century led to the resurgence of what was considered at the time \"Roman-Style Drill\". This movement was pioneered by Maurice of Nassau. Intended to enable his soldiers to efficiently handle their firearms, it proscribed forty-two movements from taking up the weapon to firing. As armies became full-time and more professionalised over the course of the 17th Century it became a natural progression for drill to expand its remit from weapons handling to the manoeuvre and forming of bodies of troops. The most notable figure of the early 17th Century was Gustavus Adolphus, who fielded one of the largest standing armies of the 30 years war before his death in battle.\n\nWhat would today be known strictly as foot drill emerged over the course of the 17th Century. This period is known as the Pike and Shot period, where muskets and arquebus without bayonets were defended from infantry and cavalry by blocks of pikemen. The requirement for quick and accurate movement of these large bodies of troops in order to outmanoeuvre their opponents on the tactical level led to the introduction of standardised movements and commands. These were the first versions of foot drill, intended to allow a group of disparate individuals to form one organised body of men, moving singlemindedly with united purpose. Additionally, in the confusion of battle it was found that the clear and concise nature of drill commands allowed the individual soldier to cope with the psychological stresses of battle. The apogee of this style of warfare is arguably the English Civil War, as the last major war using these methods before the introduction of the bayonet created \"The Queen of Battles\": the Line Infantry.\n\nLine Infantry won or lost on the rigidty of their foot drill. It was in the later 17th Century that drill evolved into a tool for the complete subordination of the individual. The Prussians famously demanded truly automatonic levels of drill competence. Constant and heavy drilling would change a man from a civilian to a soldier, obedient to commands reflexively. This instituted both disciple and subordination. In a period when private soldiers were recruited from what was considered the basest social class, it was considered particularly important to \"break the man\" into service. For all this harshness, desertion remained commonplace.\n\nIn battle, drill was a force multiplier. With the muskets of the era having short ranges owing to the nature of their ammunition and a certain reticence on the part of men to kill one another at short range, it was necessary for battalions to form up as broad lines 2 to 4 ranks deep at distances averaging 25 yards (approx 20m). In such conditions, particularly when one considers the nightmarish nature of the ubiquitous cannonade and the buildup of smoke from musket discharge, drill allowed the soldier to withdraw into himself and react to commands. There are anecdotal reports of soldiers in this almost trance-like state reaching out to try and catch cannonballs at the end of their arcs, with unpleasant results. The psychological boost which being part of an effectively faceless mass and surrendering your fate to that of the corporate group provided enabled men to stand in the face of the enemy that bit longer than said foe. As such, the better the drill, the better - in theory - the soldiers. These elements were found to be particularly powerful in Colonial Theatres by most European States, where massed drill and the discipline that imbued allowed small expeditionary forces to repeatedly defeat larger indigenous forces.\n\nAdditionally, greater drill equated to greater manoeuvreability. When troops were thoroughly drilled they could move confidently at speed without their formations - carefully proscribed in order to maximise the use of their weapons - breaking up, particularly over rough ground. When formations broke up precious time would have to be spent reforming them in the face of the enemy: additionally, loose formations breed confusion. The difference between a body of troops and a disorganised crowd is a narrow one. As such, when faced with musketry, cavalry or cannonade a loose formation would be more prone to succumbing to panic and rout. Proficiency in drill further enabled the creativity of generals. Troops who are new to drill are unconfident and tend to panic or become confused when new commands are introduced. Troops who do lots of drill can more easily be taught new formations, building off the base of experience previously garnered. In a period when all war was foot drill, this could obviously prove an advantage. As an example, the British used an unorthodox two rank line during the later 18th and early-to-mid 19th Centuries as a force multiplier. In the Peninsular Campaign they were able to adapt this formation from strictly linear to a shallow crescent. Moving from a line to a crescent may sound inconsequential, but along a frontage of some 200 persons, under battle conditions on broken ground, it is quite a feat!\n\nDrill was exported to the rest of the world on the back of Colonial victories, with most Imperial nations training local armed forces in European-style drill. One famous example of this trend were the Indian Sepoys of the British Empire.\n\nAs weapons gained in range and accuracy, foot drill became less and less important in battle. Advances as formed lines and columns were still attempted - they worked during the Crimean War but were becoming dangerously obsolete by the time of the Franco-Prussian War. The last widespread use of formed infantry in the attack, particularly in columns, was in the first few weeks of the First World War.\n\nUnited States military drill originated in 1778, as part of a training program implemented by Baron Friedrich von Steuben to improve the discipline and organisation of soldiers serving in the Continental Army. The following year Baron von Steuben, by then a Major General and the Inspector General of the Continental Army, wrote the Army's first field manual, \"\"The Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States\"\", which has come to be more commonly known as the \"Blue Book\". The methods of drill that von Steuben initiated remained largely unchanged between their inception and the time of the American Civil War. One major change to come about since that time is that troops now march at a cadence of 120 steps per minute, instead of the original 76 steps per minute at the time of the American Revolution.\n\nThe stated aim of drill is to \"\"enable a commander or noncommissioned officer to move his unit from one place to another in an orderly manner; to aid in disciplinary training by instilling habits of precision and response to the leader’s orders; and to provide for the development of all soldiers in the practice of commanding troops.\"\" \n\nBetween branches of the military, as well as between the military forces of various countries, the methods of drill will vary. In the United States Armed Forces, the basis of drill procedures can be traced to von Steuben's \"Blue Book\".\n\nDrill today is used as a teaching tool for instilling discipline into new recruits in armies the world over, although style and diligence varies from nation to nation. Some of the most famous drill in the world remains that of the Guards Division.\n\nDrill is most commonly seen at ceremonial and public functions and has evolved into something of an art-form. Many nations have dedicated Drill Teams, although the Guards Division, faithful to the history of Foot Drill, remain full service combat infantry.\n\n"}

{"id": "1796383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796383", "title": "Thomas Knowlton", "text": "Thomas Knowlton\n\nThomas W. Knowlton (November 22, 1740 – September 16, 1776) was an American patriot who served in the French and Indian War and was a colonel during the American Revolution. Knowlton is considered America's first Intelligence professional, and his unit, Knowlton's Rangers, gathered intelligence during the early Revolutionary War. Knowlton was killed in action at the Battle of Harlem Heights.\n\nKnowlton was born into a military family on November 22, 1740 in West Boxford, Massachusetts. When he was eight, his family relocated to a farm in Ashford, Connecticut (current property of the June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation). In 1755, at fifteen, Knowlton served in the French and Indian War with his older brother Daniel. He enlisted in Captain John Durkee's company, and is known to have joined Daniel on scouting missions into enemy territory. He later served in Captain John Slapp's 8th Company, where he served with Throope Chapman. He served during six campaigns in the war and was promoted to lieutenant in 1760. He also fought in Israel Putnam's company against the Spanish during the British expedition against Cuba in 1762.\n\nBy August 1762, Knowlton had returned home and married Anna Keyes. He and his wife raised nine children. At the age of thirty-three, Knowlton was appointed a Selectman of Ashford, Connecticut.\n\nOn April 18, 1775, General Thomas Gage dispatched a contingent of British troops to Lexington and Concord, about fifteen miles from Boston, Massachusetts. This action led to the outbreak of hostilities that became the American Revolution. On learning of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the militias of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire communities mobilized their members. Thomas Knowlton joined his militia, the Ashford Company, which became part of the 5th Connecticut Regiment, along with the men from Windham, Mansfield and Coventry, Connecticut. Knowlton was chosen unanimously as captain and led 200 men into Massachusetts. His force consisted of farmers, without uniforms, primarily armed with shotguns.\n\nKnowlton was ordered to Charlestown to join Colonel William Prescott. Knowlton's troops were sent by Colonel Prescott to oppose the advancing British grenadiers, and took their posts on the side of Breed's hill. Knowlton was in command of a 200 men work party. His men dismantled another fence further back and its rails to strengthen the existing fence, the space between with new-mown grass which formed an effective breastwork. There they held their ground until the general retreat, and were among those providing cover as the troops retreated. Only three men from Knowlton's company died in the battle.\n\nIn 1776, Knowlton was sent by General Washington during the Siege of Boston to burn any remaining buildings at the base of Bunker Hill, with orders to capture any British troops guarding the location. Knowlton accomplished his mission without firing a shot or losing a single man. \nYears later, Colonel Aaron Burr said: \"\"I had a full account of the Battle from Knowlton's own lips, and I believe if the chief command had been entrusted to him, the issue would have proved more fortunate. It was impossible to promote such a man too rapidly.\"\" In June 1775, for his bravery at Bunker Hill, Knowlton was promoted by Congress to major. One of his men later remembered that Knowlton was very courageous, never crying, \"Go on, boys!\" but always, \"Come on, boys!.\" On January 8, 1776, he led a troop in a successful incursion into Charlestown to burn housing used by British officers.\n\nOn August 12, 1776, General of the Army George Washington promoted Knowlton to lieutenant colonel. He was ordered to select a group of men from Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts to carry out reconnaissance missions. America's first official spies, \"Knowlton's Rangers\" were also the first organized American elite troops. The American spy, Captain Nathan Hale, was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton. The date \"1776\" on the modern U.S. Army's intelligence service seal refers to the formation of Knowlton's Rangers.\nOn September 16, 1776, a company of rangers led by Knowlton was scouting in advance of Washington's army at the Battle of Harlem Heights. While reconnoitering the British outposts they were engaged by elements of the light infantry brigade commanded by Major General Alexander Leslie. They managed a successful retreat and later mounted a counter-attack with the support of riflemen led by Major Andrew Leitch of Virginia. General Washington ordered the units to fall on the enemy's rear, while a feint in front engaged the British troops’ attention. Knowlton's force turned prematurely and made contact with the right flank of the British instead, losing the element of surprise. In the face of heavy fire from the British, Knowlton rallied his troops to carry on the attack. Both American commanding officers fell mortally wounded in front of their men. Knowlton's loss was lamented by Washington in his general orders for September 17, 1776 with the statement \"\"The gallant and brave Col Knowlton, ... would have been an Honor to any Country, having fallen yesterday, while gloriously fighting ...for his country \"\".\n\nIn 1995 the Military Intelligence Corps Association established the LTC Thomas W. Knowlton Award. The Knowlton Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to the promotion of Army Military Intelligence in ways that stand out in the eyes of the recipients, their superiors, subordinates and peers. These individuals must also demonstrate the highest standards of integrity and moral character, display an outstanding degree of professional competence, and serve the MI Corps with distinction.\n\nAn August 1, 2012 posthumous recipient of the Knowlton Award was Marian Rejewski, the mathematician-cryptologist at the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau who in late 1932 reconstructed the German military Enigma cipher machine. Marian Rejewski's posthumous Knowlton Award was accepted at his home town, Bydgoszcz, Poland, on September 4, 2012 by his mathematician daughter, Janina Sylwestrzak.\n\n\n"}

Despite its name, the station is not close to the river Tisza; it was named after the company that built it.\n\nMiskolc's need for connection with other cities by railway lines arose in the 1830s. Plans were made to expand the Szolnok–Debrecen railway line towards Nyíregyháza and Miskolc, but due to the political situations of the time – there was a revolution against Habsburg rule in 1848–49 – construction was delayed until 1857.\n\nDisagreements between the railway constructing company and the local government of the city hindered work. The local government wanted the station to be built at the end of Széchenyi Street, the main street of Miskolc, approximately where the Szinvapark shopping mall stands today, and said the area that the constructing company appointed (and where the station was eventually built) was too far from the city – at that time it was indeed about 2,5 kilometres away and the cost of transporting goods from the city to the station was too high for local merchants. Because of the disagreement the local government didn't support the building of the railway lines, and on May 24, 1859 the newly built station was opened without any opening ceremony. The station was simply called \"Miskolc Railway Station\" then; it got its current name in 1959.\n\nIn 1860 Miskolc was connected by railway to Košice (then called Kassa, it was the other leading city of Northern Hungary and in many ways a rival of Miskolc), in 1870 the Miskolc-Pest line was ready, and in 1871 the Gömör line was built.\n\nOn June 2, 1944 the US Air Force bombed the station as a part of Operation Frantic Joe. Many bombs fell on the city centre instead, claiming 206 lives (420 were wounded).\n\nThe station building that stands today was designed by Ferenc Pfaff and was built in 1901 in eclectic style. It is a listed historic building and was restored recently, in 1999. It was modernized in 2003.\n\nDuring the construction of the building important archaeological findings were made, indicating a Celtic presence in the area.\n\nThe square where the station stands is one of the most important traffic hubs of Miskolc. Both of the Miskolc tram lines and several bus lines (1, 1A, 101, 17, 21, 23, 31) of MVK ZRt. have their terminus here. The square is named in honor of Kálmán Kandó (1869–1931), a Hungarian engineer who developed components for electric locomotives.\n\n\n"}

The stations were built into the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between 4th and 5th avenues in downtown Portland, and were the 22nd and 8th stops eastbound on the Blue Line and the Red Line, respectively. For just over five years, they were also served by the Yellow Line from its opening in May 2004 until its rerouting to the Portland Transit Mall in August 2009.\n\nWhen MAX began operating in 1986, there were no stations at this location because it was anticipated the block would be redeveloped in the near future. The stops were infilled following the completion of Pioneer Place in 1990. In March 2020, TriMet closed the stations as part of a program to speed up MAX trains in downtown.\n\nIn July 1981, the Portland City Council laid out guidelines for what would become the Morrison Street Project, a proposed mixed-use development of three blocks in downtown Portland near the intersection of the Portland Transit Mall and TriMet's planned light rail line. That November, TriMet published a conceptual design report for the Banfield light rail project that outlined a pair of light rail stations to serve the development. The agency recommended platforms to be situated along the north end of the block southeast of Southwest 5th Avenue and Morrison Street and on the opposite end of the same block on Yamhill Street.\n\nIn 1983, the Portland Development Commission (PDC) selected the Rouse Company's proposal to construct a mall and mixed-use development, which the developer named Pioneer Place. PDC approved Rouse's design in August 1984, which included a 400-room hotel, 1,025 underground parking spaces, and buildings up to 25 stories high. In 1985, Rouse said it had encountered problems signing tenants, citing a weak market for hotels and department stores, and announced a six-month delay in construction. The following year, the developer offered a scaled-down revision of its initial proposal after failing to secure key tenants and further postponed the start of construction to 1987, a year after the planned opening of the light rail line. MAX Light Rail began operating on September 5, 1986, without a stop to serve this location.\n\nPDC approved the scaled-back revisions in October 1986. The following December, the city council authorized the construction of a six-story parking garage on a fourth block bound by Yamhill and Taylor streets and 3rd and 4th avenues. In 1987, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that the city violated state law by condemning this fourth block without first seeking a review from Multnomah County, but the county board ultimately approved the parking garage in October of that year. The groundbreaking of Pioneer Place I, the first of a two-phased development plan, took place on March 3, 1988. \n\nDuring the construction of Pioneer Place, TriMet planners revisited plans to add infill stops at this location. The MAX platforms were ultimately built; the Mall stations—their names referring to the Portland Transit Mall—opened on March 26, 1990. From opening until 1998, the Mall stations were served by one MAX service that ran from Cleveland Avenue in central Gresham to 11th Avenue. In September 1998, TriMet extended this line farther west to Hatfield Government Center in downtown Hillsboro. On September 10, 2001, the Red Line, which connected downtown—and eventually Beaverton—to Portland International Airport became the second line to serve the stations while the original line became the Blue Line. From May 2004 to August 2009, the Yellow Line, which ran to the Expo Center in North Portland, also stopped at these stations until it was rerouted to the Portland Transit Mall.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years in operation, the Mall stations closed on March 1, 2020, as part of a consolidation program to speed up MAX trains in downtown Portland. , the area will continue to be served by the Blue and Red lines via the Pioneer Square South and Pioneer Square North stations, which are located two blocks to the west; and the Yamhill District and Morrison/Southwest 3rd Avenue stations, which are located two-to-three blocks to the east.\n\nThe Mall stations occupied the sidewalks facing Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between 4th and 5th avenues in downtown Portland. Pioneer Place I, the first of two mall structures that were built as part of the Pioneer Place project, is located between the stations' former platforms. The stations' amenities included benches, bicycle racks, garbage cans, shelters, and\nschedule information displays.\n\nThe southbound light rail tracks on the Portland Transit Mall run along the immediate west side of the platforms on 5th Avenue; this provided a direct transfer to the MAX platform of Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th station across the street, which is served by the Green and Orange lines. On the opposite end of this adjacent block, which is occupied by the Pioneer Courthouse, is the northbound MAX station, Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th. This station is served by the Green and Yellow lines. The Mall stations also facilitated transfers to buses serving the Portland Transit Mall.\n\nOn the final day of service, the Mall stations were served by the MAX Blue Line, which connected the stations to Beaverton and Hillsboro to the west and Gresham to the east, and the MAX Red Line, which connected the stations to Beaverton to the west and Portland International Airport to the east. In late 2019, Mall/Southwest 5th Avenue and Mall/Southwest 4th Avenue were the 25th and 39th busiest stations of the MAX network's 97 stations, respectively, based on TriMet's weekday on-and-off boarding totals. Mall/Southwest 5th Avenue recorded 3,436 passengers on weekdays while Mall/Southwest 4th Avenue recorded 2,467 passengers.\n\n"}

Beban won the 1967 Heisman Trophy, narrowly beating out O.J. Simpson, and the Maxwell Award while playing quarterback for the UCLA Bruins. He played professional football for two seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Washington Redskins. Beban was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe son of an Italian-born mother and a first-generation Croatian-American father, Beban graduated from Sequoia High School in Redwood City, California.\n\nBeban, known as \"The Great One\", excelled in both academics and athletics, majoring in European history while quarterbacking the Bruins across three straight winning seasons. As a quarterback at the University of California, Los Angeles, he was named to the all-conference team three times, and led the Bruins to a 24–5–2 record. His school record for total offense lasted for 15 years. As a sophomore, he threw two touchdown passes in the last four minutes to rally the Bruins over their crosstown arch-rival, USC, 20–16. In the 1966 Rose Bowl, Beban scored both UCLA's touchdowns in the Bruins' 14–12 victory over  1 ranked Michigan State.\n\nIn his senior year, Beban played in the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game, widely regarded as one of the best college football games of all time. The game pitted No. 4 AP (No. 2 UPI) ranked USC, and their Heisman Trophy candidate running back O. J. Simpson, against the No. 1 ranked Bruins and Beban—also a Heisman Trophy candidate—with both the AAWU and national championships on the line. Badly injured with torn rib cartilage and in great pain, he still threw for over 300 yards and two touchdown passes to lead the Bruins in scoring. Although USC eventually won the game 21–20 on a blocked PAT, and went on to the Rose Bowl, Beban would go on to win the Heisman Trophy. Both Beban and Simpson were featured on the cover of the November 20 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine. Commenting on Beban's heroic effort playing through injury, famed \"L.A. Times\" columnist Jim Murray wrote that if \"Gary Beban wins the Heisman Trophy, they ought to fill it with aspirin\".\n\nIn addition to winning the Heisman, Beban was unanimously named to the All-America Team, won the Maxwell Award, and was awarded the Washington Touchdown Club Trophy and the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. He was also named a National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete and received the Dolly Cohen award, given to the player best combining academic and football achievement.\n\nUCLA became the first school to have a player of the year winner in both basketball and football in the same year, with Beban winning the Heisman Trophy and Lew Alcindor winning the U.S. Basketball Writers Association player of the year award in 1968. For one week in November 1967, UCLA had the No. 1 ranked football and men's basketball teams, with the chance of landing national championships in both sports. UCLA did ultimately garner the 1968 basketball championship.\n\nBeban was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1991. He is a charter member of the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, and the Bruins retired his No. 16 jersey. Although the UCLA football program has turned out a high proportion of successful professional players through the years, Beban remains the only Bruin to win the Heisman.\n\nAfter graduating from UCLA, Beban was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the second round (30th overall) of the 1968 NFL draft. His draft rights were traded to the Washington Redskins on June 14, 1968, after failing to agree to terms on a contract with the Rams, in exchange for a first-round draft pick in 1969 (the Rams used the pick, 10th overall, to select split end Jim Seymour). Beban signed a reported three-year contract worth $200,000 three days later. He played for the Redskins in 1968 and 1969. But, sitting behind veteran quarterback and future NFL Hall-of-Famer Sonny Jurgensen, Beban was not given much game time, and the professional stardom portended by his college career was not forthcoming. After being released from the Redskins on September 8, 1970, Beban signed with the Denver Broncos following the 1970 season. However, he was placed on waivers on August 5, 1971, and retired from professional football immediately.\n\nIn 1971, Beban joined the Los Angeles office of CB Richard Ellis, a global real estate services company. Beginning in 1975, he worked to establish offices in the Chicago area. He was named president and general manager of the company in 1985, and in 1998 became senior executive managing director of the company's Global Corporate Services unit. For several years in the 1970s, he also provided unique color commentary for UCLA football telecasts.\n\nIn 2009, UCLA scheduled a special \"Throwback Jersey\" day in Beban's honor for the UCLA-Washington homecoming game at the Rose Bowl, where the team dressed in the powder-blue and white shoulder-stripe jerseys with pure gold helmets (without decals) of UCLA's 1965–66–67 seasons, uniforms first devised by the coach Red Sanders for his teams of the 1950s, including the 1954 National Championship team. Fans were able to purchase Beban's number 16 jersey to wear \"en masse\" that day.\n\n"}
{"id": "1796418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796418", "title": "Visibility", "text": "Visibility\n\nIn meteorology, visibility is a measure of the distance at which an object or light can be clearly discerned. It is reported within surface weather observations and METAR code either in meters or statute miles, depending upon the country. Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads, sailing and aviation. Meteorological visibility refers to transparency of air: in dark, meteorological visibility is still the same as in daylight for the same air.\n\nICAO Annex 3 \"Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation\" contains the following definitions and note:\nAnnex 3 also defines Runway Visual Range (RVR) as:\n\nIn extremely clean air in Arctic or mountainous areas, the visibility can be up to 240 km (150 miles) where there are large markers such as mountains or high ridges. However, visibility is often reduced somewhat by air pollution and high humidity. Various weather stations report this as haze (dry) or mist (moist). Fog and smoke can reduce visibility to near zero, making driving extremely dangerous. The same can happen in a sandstorm in and near desert areas, or with forest fires. Heavy rain (such as from a thunderstorm) not only causes low visibility, but the inability to brake quickly due to hydroplaning. Blizzards and ground blizzards (blowing snow) are also defined in part by low visibility.\n\nTo define visibility the case of a perfectly black object being viewed against a perfectly white background is examined. The visual contrast, \"C\"(x), at a distance \"x\" from the black object is defined as the relative difference between the light intensity of the background and the object\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere \"F\"(x) and \"F\"(x) are the intensities of the background and the object, respectively. Because the object is assumed to be perfectly black, it must absorb all of the light incident on it. Thus when \"x\"=0 (at the object), \"F\"(0) = 0 and \"C\"(0) = 1.\n\nBetween the object and the observer, \"F\"(x) is affected by additional light that is scattered into the observer's line of sight and the absorption of light by gases and particles. Light scattered by particles outside of a particular beam may ultimately contribute to the irradiance at the target, a phenomenon known as multiple scattering. Unlike absorbed light, scattered light is not lost from a system. Rather, it can change directions and contribute to other directions. It is only lost from the original beam traveling in one particular direction. The multiple scattering's contribution to the irradiance at \"x\" is modified by the individual particle scattering coefficient, the number concentration of particles, and the depth of the beam. The intensity change \"dF\" is the result of these effects over a distance \"dx\". Because \"dx\" is a measure of the amount of suspended gases and particles, the fraction of \"F\" that is diminished is assumed to be proportional to the distance, \"dx\". The fractional reduction in \"F\" is\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere \"b\" is the attenuation coefficient. The scattering of background light into the observer's line of sight can increase \"F\" over the distance \"dx\". This increase is defined as \"b' F\"(\"x\") \"dx\", where \"b\"' is a constant. The overall change in intensity is expressed as\n\nformula_3\n\nSince \"F\" represents the background intensity, it is independent of \"x\" by definition. Therefore,\n\nformula_4\n\nIt is clear from this expression that \"b\"' must be equal to \"b\". Thus, the visual contrast, \"C\"(\"x\"), obeys the Beer–Lambert law\n\nformula_5\n\nwhich means that the contrast decreases exponentially with the distance from the object:\n\nformula_6\n\nLab experiments have determined that contrast ratios between 0.018 and 0.03 are perceptible under typical daylight viewing conditions. Usually, a contrast ratio of 2% (\"C\" = 0.02) is used to calculate visual range. Plugging this value into the above equation and solving for \"x\" produces the following visual range expression (the Koschmieder equation):\n\nformula_7\n\nwith \"x\" in units of length. At sea level, the Rayleigh atmosphere has an extinction coefficient of approximately 13.2 × 10 m at a wavelength of 520 nm. This means that in the cleanest possible atmosphere, visibility is limited to about 296 km.\n\nVisibility perception depends on several physical and visual factors. A realistic definition should consider the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to spatial frequencies, and then to use the Fourier transform and the contrast sensitivity\nfunction of the HVS to assess visibility.\n\nThe international definition of fog is a visibility of less than ; mist is a visibility of between and and haze from to . Fog and mist are generally assumed to be composed principally of water droplets, haze and smoke can be of smaller particle size; this has implications for sensors such as Thermal Imagers (TI/FLIR) operating in the far-IR at wavelengths of about 10 μm which are better able to penetrate haze and some smokes because their particle size is smaller than the wavelength; the IR radiation is therefore not significantly deflected or absorbed by the particles. \n\nWith fog, occasional freezing drizzle and snow can occur. This usually occurs when temperatures are below 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit). These conditions are hazardous due to ice formation, which can be deadly, particularly so because of the low visibility, which usually accompanies these conditions at below 1000 yards. The combination of low visibility and ice formation can lead to accidents on roadways. These cold weather events are caused largely by low-lying stratus clouds.\n\nVisibility of less than is usually reported as zero. In these conditions, roads may be closed, or automatic warning lights and signs may be activated to warn drivers. These have been put in place in certain areas that are subject to repeatedly low visibility, particularly after traffic collisions or pile-ups involving multiple vehicles.\n\nIn addition, an advisory is often issued by a government weather agency for low visibility, such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. National Weather Service. These generally advise motorists to avoid travel until the fog dissipates or other conditions improve. Airport travel is also often delayed by low visibility, sometimes causing long waits due to approach visibility minimums and the difficulty of safely moving aircraft on the ground in low visibility.\n\nA visibility reduction is probably the most apparent symptom of air pollution. Visibility degradation is caused by the absorption and scattering of light by particles and gases in the atmosphere. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation by gases and particles is sometimes the cause of discolorations in the atmosphere but usually does not contribute very significantly to visibility degradation.\n\nScattering by particulates impairs visibility much more readily. Visibility is reduced by significant scattering from particles between an observer and a distant object. The particles scatter light from the sun and the rest of the sky through the line of sight of the observer, thereby decreasing the contrast between the object and the background sky. Particles that are the most effective at reducing visibility (per unit aerosol mass) have diameters in the range of 0.1-1.0 µm. The effect of air molecules on visibility is minor for short visual ranges but must be taken into account for ranges above 30 km.\n\n"}

The precept of Gaebyeok applies to heaven and earth and to the realms of humanity and spirits, and it answers the mysteries of nature, explains the secrets of civilization, and resolves the limitations of Eastern and Western religions and philosophies. \n\nAfter Sangjenim’s ascension to heaven, the truth of gaebyeok was widely disseminated by the successor of His Dao lineage and authority, Taemonim (God the Mother).\n\nThe original Dojeon was published in Korean on October 25, 1992 for the 122nd commemoration of Sangjenim’s birth, and it entailed twenty years of extensive research and fieldwork by Jeung San Do practitioners as they compiled the written and oral testimonies of Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s disciples, the disciples’ descendants, and the disciples’ students. \n\nThe publication of the 2003 revised edition took an additional eleven years of effort involving further research and extensive review of old and new testimonials to verify and discover dates, sites, events, and people related to Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s works of renewing heaven and earth. \n\nThe foreign-language translations of the Dojeon are based mostly on the 1992 Korean edition. Thus, the Dojeon represents thirty years of dedication by many people; it is the culmination of Jeung San Do’s culture. \n\nArranged in eleven chapters, the Dojeon spans Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s lives, their work, their disciples, the principle upon which the universe evolves, the ultimate destiny of humanity, the existence of spirits, meditation, the times we live in, the coming civilization, and much more. Through the Dojeon, the reader can begin the process of understanding Jeung San Do’s Eight Teachings:\nThe Dojeon records the true path that will allow the people of the world to survive the Later Heaven Gaebyeok and enter the new civilization of immortality. This makes the Dojeon history’s greatest gift-a sacred text of life, not filled with words of despair and tears, but with a radiant and vivid vision of joy and hope for a future that transcends the limitations of modern civilization.

Nurikabe was apparently invented and named by Nikoli; other names (and attempts at localization) for the puzzle include \"Cell Structure\" and \"Islands in the Stream\".\n\nThe puzzle is played on a typically rectangular grid of cells, some of which contain numbers. Cells are initially of unknown color, but can only be black or white. Two same-color cells are considered \"connected\" if they are adjacent vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. Connected white cells form \"islands\", while connected black cells form the \"sea\".\n\nThe challenge is to paint each cell black or white, subject to the following rules:\n\n\nHuman solvers typically dot the non-numbered cells they've determined to be certain to belong to an island.\n\nLike most other pure-logic puzzles, a unique solution is expected, and a grid containing random numbers is highly unlikely to provide a uniquely solvable \"Nurikabe\" puzzle.\n\n\"Nurikabe\" was first developed by \"renin (れーにん),\" whose pen name is the Japanese pronunciation of \"Lenin\" and whose autonym can be read as such, in the 33rd issue of (Puzzle Communication) Nikoli at March 1991.\nIt soon created a sensation, and has appeared in all issues of that publication from the 38th to the present.\n\nAs of 2005, seven books consisting entirely of \"Nurikabe\" puzzles have been published by Nikoli.\n\nNo blind guessing should be required to solve a \"Nurikabe\" puzzle. Rather, a series of simple procedures and rules can be developed and followed, assuming the solver is sufficiently observant to find where to apply them.\n\nThe greatest mistake made by beginning solvers is to concentrate solely on determining black or white and not the other; most \"Nurikabe\" puzzles require going back and forth. Marking white cells may force other cells to be black lest a section of black be isolated, and vice versa. (Those familiar with Go can think of undetermined cells next to various regions as \"liberties\" and apply \"atari\" logic to determine how they must grow.)\n\n\n\nIt is NP-complete to solve Nurikabe, even when the involved numbers are 1 and 2 only.\n\nFurther, consider these two rules of Nurikabe:\nEither one can be ignored, giving a total of three variants. As it turns out, they are all NP-complete.\n\nThe binary determination puzzles LITS and Mochikoro, also published by Nikoli, are similar to \"Nurikabe\" and employ similar solution methods. The binary determination puzzle Atsumari is similar to \"Nurikabe\" but based upon a hexagonal tiling rather than a square tiling.\n\nMochikoro is a variant of the Nurikabe puzzle:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1796455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796455", "title": "The Judybats", "text": "The Judybats\n\nThe Judybats (sometimes stylized as merely Judybats or JudyBats) were an American alternative rock band from Knoxville, Tennessee, United States, active primarily in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. \n\nThe band was first formed in 1987, after vocalist Jeff Heiskell, who had been performing with guitarist Ed Winters in Knoxville as an acoustic duo, met bassist Tim Stutz at a local bar called Hawkeye's Corner. Stutz, guitarist Johnny Sughrue and drummer Terry Casper had known each other since high school and had been playing music together as a trio. Peggy Hambright, who was Stutz's and Sughrue’s roommate at the time, joined the band, contributing keyboards, violin and vocals. The Judybats played locally to large audiences before signing to Sire Records in 1990. The band took their name from a song written by a friend of theirs, which contained the line \"punch me with a judybat,\" a punning allusion to Punch and Judy shows. The official form of the band's name was never entirely clear — although the band was credited as \"The Judybats\" on the cover of their first album, \"Native Son\", all of their subsequent albums listed the band's name as just \"Judybats,\" or sometimes \"JudyBats,\" although several CD singles from the later albums retained the word \"The.\"\n\nThe band's first major release was a cover of The 13th Floor Elevators' \"She Lives (In a Time of Her Own),\" which appeared on Sire's Roky Erickson tribute album, \"\", in 1990. The song also appeared on the band's debut album, \"Native Son\", released the following year, and the accompanying tour saw the band opening for the likes of R.E.M. on May 9, 1991 at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, GA. \n\nCasper subsequently left the band and was temporarily replaced by session drummer Kevin Jarvis on their second album, \"Down in the Shacks Where the Satellite Dishes Grow\", in 1992. Following that album, Hambright and Stutz both left the band, and were replaced by Paul Noe on bass and David Jenkins on drums. The revised lineup released the band's most commercially successful album, \"Pain Makes You Beautiful\", in 1993, and had successful singles on college radio and adult album alternative stations with \"Being Simple,\" \"All Day Afternoon\" and \"Incredible Bittersweet.\" \n\nThe lineup remained stable for the band's fourth album, 1994's \"Full-Empty\". Heiskell had intended the album to be produced by Mitchell Froom and even sent him a demo tape of new songs, but was told by the Judybats' manager that attempts to reach Froom had been fruitless. Instead, the band opted to work with producer Paul Mahern, both because \"he was cheap\" and \"was also supposed to have some kind of indie cachet at that time.\" While recording \"Full-Empty\", Heiskell eventually received a phone call from Froom, who said he liked the songs and expressed interest in working with the band, only to be told they were already working with Mahern. \n\nThe band promoted the album by appearing on \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien\" on October 4, 1994, performing \"Sorry Counts.\" In an interview with \"The Advocate\" the following month, Heiskell acknowledged that he was gay, but otherwise rarely discussed his sexuality with the press, choosing to write about it only indirectly in his songs until his solo career. \"Full-Empty\" fared poorly on the charts and the band broke up soon afterward.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Popdose, Jeff Heiskell claimed that his dissolution of the band was attributable to several factors, with the last tour being \"a nightmare of panic attacks and depression.\" Heiskell had been writing a screenplay about his experiences as a teenager that rendered him \"an emotional wreck for nearly two years.\" Moreover, Heiskell alleged that band members Paul Noe and David Jenkins had attempted to convince him to break up the Judybats and form a new band with them. Heiskell explained, \"By the time the tour ended I weighed 157 pounds – I’m nearly six feet tall – and could scarcely go out during the day for fear of having a bout of serious anxiety.\" Additionally, Warner Bros. decided to cull their roster of artists, which saw the Judybats losing their contract. \"The idea of running about playing shows for schmucks in an attempt to get signed again made me break out in a sweat just thinking about it. And I was convinced that my life had become nothing more than trying to write the next college radio jingle of the week.\"\n\nHeiskell, Noe and Jenkins, along with guitarist Reed Pendleton, pursued a new musical direction under the name Doubters Club, an informal reconfiguration of the Judybats. They released the album \"Fleur de Lisa\" independently in 1996, after being dropped from a development deal with Sire Records. Heiskell later claimed that, following the release of the album, \"Dave and Paul moved off to Nashville, hiding from me the fact that they had started another band on the side, taking all of the equipment with them.\"\n\nAfter the Doubters Club dissolved, Heiskell seriously considered quitting the music industry, while Pendleton encouraged Jeff to stay the course. Reed's effect-layered guitar riffs paired well with Heiskell's lyrics, and soon a series of weekend songwriting sessions led to Heiskell and Pendleton creating new songs, including \"Break My Heart,\" \"Shine,\" \"You're Too Much,\" \"Full Forward Angel,\" \"Always,\" \"Love Will Out\" and \"California.\"\n\nMoving forward, Heiskell and Pendleton formed the band Shoho, Jeff's nickname for local \"scenesters\" that often attended the band's shows. The lineup consisted of Heiskell on vocals and Pendleton on guitar, joined by local bassist Rob Bell and a set of twin brothers: guitarist/fiddle player Doug Hairrell and drummer Mike Hairrell. Early band sessions were held in a remote log cabin south of Knoxville, where the new lineup developed a guitar-heavy sound with Brit-Pop influences. Upon the insistence of new manager SuperFrank, the band settled on resurrecting the name Judybats for the project. This incarnation of the band issued one album, \"Judybats '00\", in 2000, and released a cover of Paul McCartney's \"Love in Song\" for the 2001 McCartney tribute album \"Listen to What the Man Said\". \"Break My Heart\" was also included in \"Oxford American\"'s annual Southern Music issue. \n\nIn 2005, another configuration of Judybats performed at the Halsted Market Days Festival in Chicago.\n\nIn 2011, the \"Judybats '00\" track \"California\" appeared on the compilation album \"Kat Vox: Celebrating 20 Years of Timmi-Kat Records\".\n\nJeff Heiskell has since released five solo albums, under the name Heiskell: \"Soundtrack for an Aneurism\" (2007), \"Clip-On Nose Ring\" (2008), \"Arriving\" (2015), \"Emotional Terrorism\" (2017) and \"Songs in the Key of H\" (2019). \"Emotional Terrorism\" was accompanied by two videos, for the songs \"Still Life With Broken Heart\" and \"I Want More Life.\" Conceived by Heiskell himself, both were guided by videographer Douglas Stuart McDaniel, with intern Tyler Juárez Dippel shooting the footage for \"Still Life With Broken Heart.\" \"I did not feel comfortable carrying on the Judybats name with my being the only member\", Heiskell explained in 2008. \"I didn’t really feel that comfortable with it when the \"’00\" record was released, either. A millionaire control freak backed that project financially, so I felt that I had to follow his lead. I follow no one's lead now.\" In 2016, Heiskell performed several Judybats songs at Waynestock, a benefit concert for Girls Rock Camp Knoxville.\n\nIn 1992, former keyboardist Peggy Hambright founded Magpies Bakery in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was owner until 2018, when she passed the business onto her niece, Elizabeth.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, former bassist Tim Stutz released music via Bandcamp, under the name Because of Robots (stylized as \"because of robots\").\n\n\n\nA bootleg fan compilation of B-sides, rarities and live performances entitled \"Hold Your Horses\" has also been in circulation, but is not an official release by the band.\n\n"}

{"id": "1796496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796496", "title": "Brian Greenhoff", "text": "Brian Greenhoff\n\nBrian Greenhoff (28 April 1953 – 22 May 2013) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Manchester United, Leeds United and Rochdale. He was capped 18 times for England.\n\nGreenhoff was born in Barnsley, and as a youngster played for Yorkshire Schoolboys. He joined Manchester United as a youth player in August 1968, and made his first-team debut against Ipswich Town on 8 September 1973. He helped Manchester United win the 1977 FA Cup, by which time he had developed a partnership with Martin Buchan in central defence. He was very versatile, starting his career as a midfielder and finishing it as a centre back of international class. Greenhoff scored 17 goals in his Manchester United career and played 271 games between 1973 and 1979. His brother, Jimmy, also played for Manchester United.\n\nGreenhoff was brought to Manchester United as one of the last of the Busby Babes, scouted by Joe Armstrong - his childhood affinity with United, due to Barnsley born Tommy Taylor starring, played a huge role in persuading him to join the European Champions despite interest from the more local club Rotherham United, managed by Tommy Docherty. A succession of injuries prevented him from making his debut as a teenager until Docherty took over at Old Trafford. Upon greeting Greenhoff, Tommy exclaimed, \"I've got you at last. The long way round, but I've got you at last.\" Following his debut at Portman Road, Greenhoff was essentially an ever-present, one of the most vital components of Docherty's exciting young team. Despite relegation in the 1973/74 season, Greenhoff's performances had been one of the few plusses, causing him to be named the Supporters Player of the Season.\n\nThough used more often in midfield, Greenhoff was more comfortable playing at centre half - due to his talent on the ball and willingness to work hard for the team, he ended up being played in every position for the United first team - including in goal, when Alex Stepney was injured in a game at Birmingham City. Eventually Greenhoff was moved back into his preferred centre half position - by accident, according to Docherty, as his team were chasing a goal in a cup tie - and the modern United centre half was born. Disappointment in the 1976 FA Cup Final, where the image of a tearful Greenhoff being consoled by his manager became an iconic one, was followed by the best season of the players career in 1976–77. A man of the match performance against Ajax in the UEFA Cup came in a strong start to the season, where he also became a regular at the heart of the defence in the England national team. In the 1977 FA Cup Final, it is commonly agreed that Greenhoff was the man of the match.\n\nGreenhoff left for Leeds United in 1979 for £350,000, which at the time was a record transfer for anyone leaving Manchester United. He was given a free transfer when Leeds were relegated in 1982. During his time with Leeds there had been concerns expressed about his weight. He returned to the game as player-coach at Rochdale after his brother had been appointed player-manager in 1983. He left the club when Jimmy was sacked in March 1984 but stayed in the area.\n\nHe won 18 caps for England, and appeared once for England B.\nGreenhoff played four times for the England under 23 team, scoring once and made his debut for England on 8 May 1976 in a 1–0 win at Ninian Park, Cardiff against Wales. His last game came on 31 May 1980 in a friendly against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the professional game, Brian coached semi-professionally at a local level and was also able to dedicate some time to his other sporting love, cricket, at a semi-professional level for Norden. His match-winning exploits in a local rivalry game against Heywood made the local press.\n\nAfter his retirement altogether from playing sports, Greenhoff was regularly seen in the media giving his thoughts on Manchester United. In 2012, he released his autobiography, \"GREENHOFF!\" with the title dedicated to the chant that was given to him by the Stretford End.\n\nOn 22 May 2013, Greenhoff died at his home in Rochdale, England.\n\n\n"}

It consists of one or more integrators, connected in some feedback configuration. The most common implementation sums the input signal with its integral and its double integral.\n\nThe example given below can produce simultaneous lowpass, highpass and bandpass outputs from a single input. This is a second-order (biquad) filter. Its derivation comes from rearranging a high-pass filter's transfer function, which is the ratio of two quadratic functions. The rearrangement reveals that one signal is the sum of integrated copies of another. That is, the rearrangement reveals a state variable filter structure. By using different states as outputs, different kinds of filters can be produced. In more general state variable filter examples, additional filter orders are possible with more integrators (i.e., more states).\n\nThe signal input is marked V; the LP, HP and BP outputs give the lowpass, highpass and bandpass filtered signals respectively.\n\nFor simplicity, we set:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nThen:\n\nformula_4\n\nformula_5\n\nThe pass-band gain for the LP and HP outputs is given by:\n\nformula_6\n\nIt can be seen that the frequency of operation and the Q factor can be varied independently. This and the ability to switch between different filter responses make the state-variable filter widely used in analogue synthesizers.\n\nValues for a resonance frequency of 1 kHz are R = R = 10k, C = C = 15nF and R = R = 10k\n\nState variable filters are frequently used for modifying frequency response in audio signal processing. At low Q settings they are often used in parametric equaliser circuits, and at high or variable Q settings to create resonant filter modules in analog synthesizers. For manual control of frequency, R1 and R2 in the section above may be replaced by a dual potentiometer; and for voltage control, the devices U2 and U3 may be replaced by voltage controlled amplifiers or operational transconductance amplifiers.\n\n\n"}

It is the third and final game in the \"Super Star Wars\" trilogy and is based on the 1983 film \"Return of the Jedi\". There is also a simplified version for the Game Boy and Game Gear portable systems. The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America on September 7, 2009 and in PAL regions on October 16, 2009, alongside the other games in the \"Super Star Wars\" series.\n\n\"Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\" follows closely the standard set by the previous two \"Super Star Wars\" games, with the return of selectable characters (on specific levels), multiple playable characters and Mode 7 quasi-3D vehicle sequences. The controls are identical to the second game, and this installment also includes its predecessor's password save option. It loosely follows the plot of \"Return of the Jedi\", with some added scenes, such as Luke Skywalker having to fight through the Death Star to get to Emperor Palpatine. In addition to the standard Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca, Princess Leia and Wicket appear as playable characters.\n\nBosses include Jabba the Hutt, the Rancor beast, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. Vehicle sequences include the Endor speeder bike chase, and a cruise in the \"Millennium Falcon\". Luke Skywalker no longer has nine Force powers to work with but five and it is easier for him to \"recharge\" his abilities. He also cannot use any variation of the blaster in this game. Princess Leia is unique in that her appearance and playstyle changes in accordance with the plot. She uses a staff as the bounty hunter Boushh when approaching Jabba's palace, fights with a broken chain as Jabba's escaped slave on his sail barge, and wields a blaster when fighting on Endor as a Rebel leader.\n\nIn 1996 THQ announced that they would re-release \"\" and \"Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\" in February 1997 in order to coincide with the \"Special Edition\" of those films appearing in theaters.

Though he praised the musical score, he criticized the game for frustrating controls, overly easy bosses, and particularly the level designs, which he said are repetitious and mostly feel like retreads of level designs from the two previous games in the series. In contrast, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave it an 8 out of 10, praising it for the \"excellent\" graphics and the need to move carefully through the levels. \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored it a 23 out of 40.\n\n\"GamePro\"s Coach Kyle found some flaws in the Game Boy version, such as the rudimentary backgrounds, but rated it \"one of the year's most fun and challenging handheld games\", particularly due to the diverse gameplay offered by the five playable characters. Quick-Draw McGraw gave the Game Gear similar praise in the same magazine, and said the graphics are nearly as good as the SNES version's.\n\n\"Super Return of the Jedi\" was awarded Best Movie-to-Game of 1994 by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".

He was a skilful forward and although capped five times at under-23 level, once as an over-age player, he never played for the full side, and is labelled as the finest English player never to play for England. He made nearly 600 appearances in league football. His younger brother Brian was also a professional footballer.\n\nHe started his career at Leeds United in 1963, as the club came up out of the Second Division in 1963–64, and finished as First Division runners-up in 1964–65 and 1965–66. He also played in the 1967 and 1968 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup finals. He won both the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and League Cup in 1968, before he was sold to Birmingham City. In 1969, he made a £100,000 move to Stoke City. He won the League Cup with Stoke in 1972, and also lifted the Watney Cup in 1973. He was moved on to Manchester United in 1976, and lifted both the FA Cup and Charity Shield in 1977. He was switched to Crewe Alexandra in December 1980, before joining Port Vale via Toronto Blizzard in August 1981. He was appointed player-manager at Rochdale in March 1983, before he resigned in March 1984.\n\nGreenhoff was born in Barnsley, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He started his career as an apprentice with Leeds United in June 1961, having impressed in the centre-half position for Barnsley Schoolboys. He was coached by Syd Owen. He turned professional at the club in August 1963, and made his senior debut as a sixteen-year-old. Leeds finished the 1963–64 season as champions of the Second Division under Don Revie's stewardship. The \"Peacocks\" then went on to finish 1964–65 as First Division runners-up, with champions and hated rivals Manchester United finishing above them on goal average. Leeds again finished second in 1965–66, six points behind champions Liverpool; however Greenhoff missed much of the season with an ankle injury, and a head injury sustained from a car crash. They then finished fourth in 1966–67, five points off the summit; Revie began to convert Greenhoff from a winger into a centre-forward. He turned out against Dinamo Zagreb at Elland Road in the second leg of the 1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, a goalless draw, Leeds lost the tie 2–0 on aggregate.\n\nOnce again, they finished fourth in the First Division in 1967–68, five points behind champions Manchester City. Greenhoff played 37 games, including a memorable 7–0 victory over rivals Chelsea on 7 October. He went on to appear in the League Cup final in 1968 after recovering from a knee injury; United beat Arsenal 1–0 thanks to a twenty-yard strike from Terry Cooper. Greenhoff went on to score four of Leeds' nineteen goals past minnows CA Spora Luxembourg in the 1967–68 instalment of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He also appeared as a half-time substitute in the first leg of the final, a 1–0 home win over Ferencvárosi TC, which was enough to secure Leeds the trophy after a goalless draw in Budapest. Greenhoff played a total of 136 games for Leeds in league and cup, scoring 36 goals.\n\nHe was bought by Birmingham City manager Stan Cullis in August 1968, who paid the Yorkshire club a £70,000 fee. The transfer came as a surprise to many Leeds fans. Greenhoff made a huge impact at Birmingham, scoring fifteen goals in 36 games (in all competitions) as the \"Blues\" finished 1968–69 seventh in the Second Division. During the campaign he scored four goals in a 5–4 win over Fulham at St Andrew's on 5 October. Despite this, Cullis told him that he was not scoring enough goals.\n\nIn August 1969, he left Birmingham for Tony Waddington's Stoke City in a deal worth £100,000, which was a club record for Stoke. He made the switch despite late interest from Everton. He hit nine goals in 37 games in 1969–70, a tally beaten by strike partners Harry Burrows and John Ritchie. He slotted in seamlessly in the team, connecting Ritchie with the midfield by feeding off Ritchie's knock-downs and bringing the wide players into the game. In 1970–71 he hit ten goals in 43 games, appearing in Stoke's FA Cup semi-final defeat to eventual winners Arsenal. He missed an easy chance that would have put Stoke 3–0 ahead, and in an interview in 2011 he said the miss \"still gets to me\".\n\nHe played for the \"Potters\" at Wembley against Chelsea in the 1972 Football League Cup Final, which ended in a 2–1 win for Stoke – the only major trophy in the club's history. He also helped the club to the FA Cup semi-finals in 1972, his goal at Old Trafford cancelling out George Best's effort, and earning Stoke a replay, which they won. The win over Manchester United left Stoke again facing Arsenal in the semi-finals. A 1–1 draw at Villa Park led to a replay at Goodison Park; Greenhoff scored for City in the replay but Arsenal won the game 2–1 after John Radford scored from a clear offside position. Former club Leeds beat the \"Gunners\" in the final. Overall, he played a massive 54 games in 1971–72, scoring sixteen goals, two fewer than John Ritchie.\n\nHe scored twenty goals in 46 appearances in 1972–73, making him the club's top-scorer. These goals included a hat-trick at home to Manchester City on 23 September, and a brace against City at Maine Road in a 3–2 defeat in the FA Cup. He hit ten goals in 44 games in 1973–74, not including his brace against Hull City in the final of the Watney Cup at the Victoria Ground. Greenhoff then began to play to the best of his abilities with the arrival of Alan Hudson. He scored fifteen goals in 47 games in 1974–75, making him the club's top-scorer for a second time after he outscored Terry Conroy and Geoff Hurst by two and four goals respectively. A volley against former club Birmingham in December 1974 was voted ITV's goal of the season. He hit thirteen goals in 46 games in 1975–76, making him the club's joint-top scorer along with Ian Moores. England manager Don Revie picked Greenhoff to play against Wales in March 1976, but he was unable to play due to it clashing with a league fixture, and never got another chance at international level.\n\nAfter three goals in sixteen games in 1976–77, he was sold to Tommy Docherty's Manchester United in November 1976 for £120,000; with Stoke needing the money to pay a bill for £250,000 to repair the Victoria Ground following a powerful wind-storm. Though Docherty intended him to play alongside Stuart Pearson, the move also meant that he would play alongside his brother, Brian Greenhoff. He scored a total of 97 goals for Stoke in 338 league and cup starts, putting him ninth in the club's overall goalscoring charts. A legend at the club, many Stoke fans consider him to be the greatest England player never to win a senior cap.\n\nHe scored twelve goals in 34 games for United in 1976–77, bagging a hat-trick against Newcastle United on 19 February. However, he greatest contribution would be in the FA Cup. He scored both United's goals in a 2–1 win over Southampton in a Fifth Round replay, before he put the \"Red Devils\" into the final by scoring past former club Leeds in a 2–1 semi-final victory at Hillsborough. He then went on to score the winner in the final after getting in the way of Lou Macari's wayward shot; in doing so he denied opponents and bitter rivals Liverpool the treble.\n\nHe appeared in the 1977 FA Charity Shield, which ended as a goalless draw, leaving Manchester United and Liverpool to share the shield. Greenhoff finished the 1977–78 campaign with six goals in 28 games. He finished 1978–79 as the club's top-scorer with seventeen goals, and supporters voted him Player of the Year. He also played in the 1979 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won 3–2 thanks to a last minute Alan Sunderland goal. Though this was as close as manager Dave Sexton would come to a major honour as United boss, Sexton did sign Joe Jordan, who would form a successful partnership with Greenhoff. United finished second in 1979–80, two points behind Liverpool, as Greenhoff was limited to just five games due to injury. He played twelve games in 1980–81.\n\nHe was allowed to join Crewe Alexandra in December 1980. Greenhoff had scored a total of 36 goals in 123 appearances (including 4 substitute appearances) for Manchester United. He was reunited with former boss Tony Waddington, and though Crewe were a struggling Fourth Division side, Greenhoff managed four goals in eleven league games. He moved to North American Soccer League side Toronto Blizzard in March 1981, then led by Keith Eddy. The \"Blizzard\" were a poor side, and finished bottom of their division, despite Greenhoff scoring six goals in 24 games.\n\nHe returned to Stoke-on-Trent to sign for Port Vale in August 1981. He played 38 games in 1981–82, but scored just three goals for John McGrath's Fourth Division side. Greenhoff struck twice in seventeen games in 1982–83. Notably, on 6 November, local paper \"The Sentinel\" reported a \"Heavy defeat for Port Vale\" after Vale were 3–0 down to Rochdale at Spotland at half-time, only for Greenhoff to inspire a fightback for the \"Valiants\", and help the club to a 3–3 draw.\n\nHe left Vale Park in March 1983 to join Rochdale, where he was appointed player-manager. He played a total of seventeen games for the \"Dale\", but did not find the net. Under his management, the club avoided the re-election zone in 1982–83, but again struggled in 1983–84, and he left the club in March 1984, later returning to Vale Park for a brief spell as coach and assistant manager.\n\nGreenhoff could play with both feet, and was known for his dangerous runs into the opposition penalty box. He was a talented and skilful player, who had great positional strength and a tremendous volley. He liked to play 'no look' passes.\n\nGreenhoff suffered a financial crisis in 1996 following a failed insurance venture, and took up work in a warehouse, refusing to sell off his FA Cup winner's medal. The crisis came about after discovering that his friend and business partner of nine years had been conning him out of large sums of money. He later worked at a pharmaceutical company in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his career with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), where he was a ECW Triple Crown Champion. He is also known for innovating the notable three-quarter facelock jawbreaker, which he called \"Whipper-Snapper\" and was later used by Stone Cold Steve Austin, who popularized the move by the name \"Stone Cold Stunner\". Whipwreck is a former world champion, winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship once. He also became a two-time World Television Champion and a three-time World Tag Team Champion in ECW.\n\nWatson began his professional wrestling career in ECW in 1994 and received the push of an underdog, who quickly captured the Television Championship, his first title in the company. He would later form an on-and-off partnership with Cactus Jack, with whom he held the World Tag Team Championship twice between 1994 and 1996. A year later, Whipwreck captured the World Heavyweight Championship at age 22 and became the youngest ECW World Heavyweight Champion. He would compete as a mid-carder in the company before leaving in 1998 but returned to the company in late 1999 after a short stint with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Shortly after his return, Whipwreck aligned with The Sinister Minister and formed a tag team with Yoshihiro Tajiri called The Unholy Alliance and won his third World Tag Team Championship with Tajiri. The team existed until ECW's closure in 2001. Since October \n28, 2018, Whipwreck along with Jerry Lynn and Mike Freland, started and co-hosts a podcast named Front Row Material\n\nBefore becoming a professional wrestler, Watson joined Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) as a part of their ring crew, who would usually work for free as long as they could have fun in the ring themselves before and after shows had finished. Joey Styles suggested to ECW booker Paul Heyman to check him after watching Watson practice a variety of aerial maneuvers before a live show began. He was hired in ECW after being asked by Heyman to wrestle in the company. Watson was trained by future tag team partner Mick Foley and made his debut under the ring name Mikey Whipwreck on the February 1, 1994 episode of \"NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling\", where he teamed with Keith Shearer in a tag team match against Kevin Sullivan and The Tazmaniac. Whipwreck continued to make appearances as an enhancement talent for the next three months on \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\".\n\nOn the May 17 episode of \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\", Whipwreck defeated The Pitbull to win the World Television Championship, his first title in ECW. Whipwreck was heavily pushed upon his debut as a fan favorite underdog character. He made his first televised title defense against Kevin Sullivan on the May 24 episode of \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\", where Whipwreck won by disqualification. He made a successful title defense against 911 by disqualification at the When Worlds Collide event. Whipwreck soon entered a feud with Jason after Jason interfered in Whipwreck's title defenses against Rockin' Rebel at Hostile City Showdown and Chad Austin at Heat Wave and assaulted him during his matches. Whipwreck dropped the World Television Championship to Jason in a no disqualification match at the Hardcore Heaven event on August 13 when The Pitbulls attacked Whipwreck.\n\nTwo weeks later, at the NWA World Title Tournament, Whipwreck substituted for Terry Funk and won the World Tag Team Championship with Cactus Jack by defeating The Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock). The duo held the titles until November to Remember, where they lost the titles back to Public Enemy. Whipwreck closed the year with a win over Don E. Allen at Holiday Hell in December. He was named the Rookie of the Year by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" in 1994. Whipwreck continued his rivalry with Jason in early 1995 and formed a tag team with Hack Meyers. Whipwreck and Meyers lost to Jason and Paul Lauria in a tag team match at Return of the Funker on February 25. The duo soon began a feud with Raven's Nest after Whipwreck defeated Stevie Richards at Hostile City Showdown. Whipwreck joined forces with Raven's Nest rival Tommy Dreamer to take on Raven and Stevie Richards in a tag team match at Enter Sandman, which Whipwreck's team lost.\n\nWhipwreck began to ascend the ranks, while also expanding his moveset in the meantime. He received his first major main event push on the August 1 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" when he won a battle royal by lastly eliminating Marty Jannetty to become the #1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, he was unsuccessful in his title shot against The Sandman. Whipwreck began feuding with Sandman over the title. He defeated Sandman in a Singapore cane match at Wrestlepalooza. At Gangstas Paradise, Whipwreck teamed with Public Enemy against Sandman, New Jack and 2 Cold Scorpio in a Gangstas Paradise match, which Whipwreck's team won. On the October 31 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", Whipwreck defeated Sandman in a ladder match to win the World Heavyweight Championship, becoming the youngest world champion in professional wrestling history and a Triple Crown Champion in ECW. Whipwreck successfully defended the title against Steve Austin at November to Remember. At December to Dismember on December 9, Whipwreck defended the title against Sandman and Austin in a three-way dance, where Whipwreck was the first to be eliminated by Austin. Sandman won the title.\n\nWatson continued his championship success at the Holiday Hell Tour on December 29, when he defeated 2 Cold Scorpio in a Winner Takes All match to win Scorpio's World Television Championship and the World Tag Team Championship (which Scorpio held with Sandman), with assistance by former tag team partner Cactus Jack, who delivered a double underhook DDT to Scorpio and put Whipwreck on top of him for the pinfall. Whipwreck was dissatisfied with the title win but Jack chose himself as Whipwreck's other half of the World Tag Team Champions. Whipwreck lost the World Television Championship back to Scorpio at House Party on January 5, 1996, after interference by Raven.\n\nWhipwreck and Cactus were unable to maintain a successful partnership due to Cactus's dirty tactics. The duo dropped the World Tag Team Championship to The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus) on the February 6 episode of \"Hardcore TV\". After the match, Cactus turned on Whipwreck with the aid of Raven and Whipwreck began feuding with Cactus. At CyberSlam, Whipwreck cost Cactus, a match against Shane Douglas, setting a match between the former tag team partners at Big Ass Extreme Bash, which would turn out to be Cactus' farewell match in the company. Whipwreck was defeated following several chair shots and a piledriver.\n\nAt CyberSlam, Whipwreck began a new angle with Taz by picking up a fight with him after Taz continued to assault his defeated opponent Joel Hartgood after the match, but Whipwreck was taken down with a \"Tazmission\". Whipwreck lost to Taz in a series of matches including one at Big Ass Extreme Bash on March 8. At Heat Wave, Whipwreck attempted to regain the ECW World Tag Team Championship from The Eliminators with Sabu as his partner but failed to win the titles. He captured the European Wrestling Association (EWA) European Junior Heavyweight Championship on August 2 by defeating The Dirt Bike Kid and appeared with the belt on ECW television until losing it to Sabu at London, England in December. Whipwreck appeared on the February 24, 1997 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", emanating from ECW's home arena Manhattan Center where he lost to Taz as part of an angle between ECW and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He took a hiatus from ECW for the next few months until returning to television on the May 29 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", where he and Spike Dudley lost to Big Dick Dudley and D-Von Dudley. Whipwreck and Dudley began teaming together and got involved in a feud with PG-13. Whipwreck and Dudley lost to PG-13 at the Orgy of Violence event but defeated PG-13 and Whipwreck's longtime rival Jason in a handicap match at July's Heat Wave pay-per-view.\n\nWhipwreck was next placed in a rivalry with the undefeated newcomer Justin Credible, who was being managed by Jason. Whipwreck faced Credible in a match at November to Remember, which Whipwreck won by pinning him after a \"Whipper-Snapper\", ending Credible's televised winning streak. Whipwreck disappeared from television and returned at the Living Dangerously pay-per-view on March 1, 1998, where he helped Tommy Dreamer in beating Credible. Whipwreck lost to Credible in a rematch at May's Wrestlepalooza. He competed against Rob Van Dam for the ECW World Television Championship at It Ain't Seinfeld, where the match ended in a no contest after Sabu interfered and attacked Van Dam. Whipwreck would then compete against Sabu in a series of matches throughout the year. His last rivalry in the company was against Jerry Lynn. He defeated Lynn in the opening match of UltraClash on September 19. His last televised match in ECW was a loss to Lynn on the December 17 episode of \"Hardcore TV\".\n\nWatson left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in late 1998. He made his surprise WCW debut at the Uncensored pay-per-view in March 1999, unsuccessfully challenging Billy Kidman for the Cruiserweight Championship. He made only three more pay-per-view appearances. He would lose to Scotty Riggs at Spring Stampede and Van Hammer at The Great American Bash. His final WCW pay-per-view match was a Junkyard Invitational at Bash at the Beach. He left WCW after several months, disillusioned by his lack of a push. While in WCW, he generally wrestled in the cruiserweight division or competed against fellow ECW alumni in the hardcore division, which made him have second thoughts about staying in WCW. His last match was a draw against Chase Tatum on the August 23 episode of \"Monday Nitro\".\n\nWatson returned to the ECW in October 1999, making his televised return to the company on the October 31 episode of \"Hardcore TV\". He was brought back to the company by Lou E. Dangerously and faced Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship but lost. Whipwreck unsuccessfully challenged Rob Van Dam for the World Television Championship on the December 26 \"Hardcore TV\". In 2000, Whipwreck faced C.W. Anderson in a losing effort at Guilty as Charged.\n\nWhipwreck competed as a mid-carder, aligning himself with The Sinister Minister, during which his character was changed from a lovable loser to a mad-pyromaniac. During this time, he began competing against lighter wrestlers in the cruiserweight division. He competed in elimination matches at May's Hardcore Heaven and July's Heat Wave pay-per-views. During this time, he frequently feuded with Little Guido and joined forces with Yoshihiro Tajiri. Whipwreck and Tajiri formed a tag team called The Unholy Alliance. The duo entered a tag team tournament for the vacant ECW World Tag Team Championship. They defeated Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke) in the quarter-final round, EZ Money and Julio Dinero in the semi-final round and the teams of Jerry Lynn and Tommy Dreamer and Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger in the final round, a three-way dance to win the vacant titles. Unholy Alliance dropped the belts to Full Blooded Italians on the September 8 episode of \"ECW on TNN\". Unholy Alliance unsuccessfully challenged The FBI for the tag titles at Anarchy Rulz. The duo got another opportunity for the titles at November to Remember, where Whipwreck was injured in the match and was replaced by Super Crazy.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a brief alliance between Super Crazy and Unholy Alliance, which ended after the trio lost to Hot Commodity (EZ Money, Julio Dinero and Chris Hamrick) in a six-man tag team match on the November 19 episode of \"Hardcore TV\". Unholy Alliance turned on Crazy when Whipwreck helped Tajiri in defeating Crazy in a match by delivering a \"Whipper-Snapper\" to Crazy, allowing Tajiri to get the win. The duo became villains in the process. Unholy Alliance began feuding with Crazy and the duo defeated Crazy and his partner Kid Kash in a tag team match at Massacre on 34th Street. Unholy Alliance defeated Crazy and Kash and Full Blooded Italians in a three-way dance at ECW's final pay-per-view Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001. Unholy Alliance won the match. This was his final match as the company folded down due to bankruptcy after holding its final event on January 13.\n\nIn early 2001, Whipwreck announced his intention to retire in May 2002 if he was not hired by the World Wrestling Federation or BRC in the interim, expressing an interest in pursuing a career in pyrotechnics. By June 11 he had decided to retire by September of that year, as his wrestling style had begun resulting in a number of nagging injuries, including two herniated discs, damaged knees, a damaged right shoulder and a jaw cracked to the point of not even being able to eat hard food. In tribute to Whipwreck, Border City Wrestling hosted \"The Mikey Whipwreck Retirement Bash\" on August 29, 2001 at the Cicciaro Club in Windsor, Ontario and featured a number of prominent ECW performers, such as Tommy Dreamer and Sabu. Whipwreck wrestled his American retirement match on October 20, 2001, defeating Little Guido.\n\nWhipwreck broke his retirement before long, returning in 2003. He wrestled in several different promotions, such as Ring of Honor, where he would often team with or against some of the wrestlers he has trained. He also made a one-time appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he teamed with The Sandman at one of TNA's weekly pay-per-views against The Gathering (CM Punk and Julio Dinero) in a losing effort. He later appeared at Hardcore Homecoming, ECW reunion tour organized by fellow ECW alum Shane Douglas, in mid-2005. On the Extreme Reunion portion of the tour, he teamed with Chris Chetti to defeat Simon Diamond and C.W. Anderson on June 10. Two days later at the first-ever ECW One Night Stand, Whipwreck, Yoshihiro Tajiri and The Sinister Minister reunited for one night only as Whipwreck and The Minister stood in Tajiri's corner during his three-way dance against Little Guido and Super Crazy.\n\nDuring April 2006, Whipwreck worked as an agent for Liberty States Wrestling. At the second ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 11, 2006, Whipwreck was seen on camera celebrating with other ECW wrestlers after Rob Van Dam won the WWE Championship.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, in his final New England wrestling appearance, Whipwreck was set to team with The Blue Meanie to challenge for the NECW Tag Team Championship at New England Championship Wrestling's Genesis 8 event in Quincy, Massachusetts, but due to car troubles Whipwreck was unable to attend the event, causing The Blue Meanie to pick a replacement. \n\nOn September 11, 2010, Whipwreck and Syther defeated Big Time Rush (Tony Burma and Ryan Rush) to win the New York Wrestling Connection Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn May 24, 2012, Whipwreck made his debut for his former partner, Tajiri's new Wrestling New Classic (WNC) promotion in Tokyo. He teamed with Tajiri in a tag team hardcore match, where they defeated Jado & Gedo. Two days later, Whipwreck and Tajiri defeated Yo-Hey and Yusuke Kodama in another tag team hardcore match in Osaka. Whipwreck's tour of WNC concluded on May 27, when he, Tajiri and Kana were defeated in a six-person main event by Akira, Dave Finlay and Syuri. Whipwreck returned to WNC on August 30, when he, Kana and Tajiri were defeated in a Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch by Akira, StarBuck and Syuri, with Akira pinning Whipwreck for the win. Whipwreck, Kana and Tajiri were also defeated in a rematch the following day in Osaka. On September 1, in the third and final Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch between the two teams, Whipwreck pinned StarBuck to win the match for his team.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, Watson announced his intention to \"let Mikey Whipwreck fade into the past\".\n\nOn September 14, 2015, it was announced that Mikey Whipwreck would be a playable character in the \"WWE 2K16\" video game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796516", "title": "Jamgon Kongtrul", "text": "Jamgon Kongtrul\n\nJamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thayé (, 1813–1899), also known as Jamgön Kongtrül the Great, was a Tibetan Buddhist scholar, poet, artist, physician, tertön and polymath. He was one of the most prominent Tibetan Buddhists of the 19th century and he is credited as one of the founders of the Rimé movement (non-sectarian), compiling what is known as the \"Five Great Treasuries\". He achieved great renown as a scholar and writer, especially among the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages and composed over 90 volumes of Buddhist writing, including his magnum opus, The Treasury of Knowledge.\n\nKongtrül was born in Rongyab (rong rgyab), Kham, then part of the Derge Kingdom. He was first tonsured at a Bon monastery, and then at 20 became a monk at Shechen, a major Nyingma monastery in the region, later moving on to the Kagyu Palpung monastery in 1833 under the Ninth Tai Situ, Pema Nyinje Wangpo (1775-1853). He studied many fields at Palpung, including Buddhist philosophy, tantra, medicine, architecture, poetics and Sanskrit. By thirty he had received teachings and empowerments from more than sixty masters from the different schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Kongtrül studied and practiced mainly in the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions, including Mahamudra and Dzogchen, but also studied and taught Jonang Kalachakra. He also went on tour with the fourteenth Karmapa and taught him Sanskrit. He became an influential figure in Kham and eastern Tibet, in matters of religion as well as in secular administration and diplomacy. He was influential in saving Palpung monastery when an army from the Tibetan government of Central Tibet occupied Kham in 1865. \n\nKongtrül was affected by the political and inter-religious conflict going on in Tibet during his life and worked together with other influential figures, mainly Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892) and also with the Nyingma treasure revealer Chogyur Lingpa (1829–1870) and Ju Mipham Gyatso (1846–1912). Kongtrül and his colleages worked together to compile, exchange and revive the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. This movement came to be named Rimé (\"Ris med\"), “nonsectarian,” or “impartial,” because it held that there was value in all Buddhist traditions, and all were worthy of study and preservation. According to Sam van Schaik, without this collecting and printing of rare works, the later suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. \n\nJamgon Kongtrül's personal hermitage was Kunzang Dechen Osel Ling (\"kun bzang bde chen 'od gsal gling\"), \"the Garden of Auspicious Bliss and Clear Light\", and was built on a rocky outcrop above Palpung monastery. It became an important center for the practice of three year retreats. This is also where he composed most of his major works. Kongtrül's works, especially his 10 volume \" The Treasury of Knowledge.\" has been very influential, especially in the Kagyu and Nyingma schools.\n\nBesides promoting a general inclusiveness and non-sectarian attitude towards all the different Buddhist lineages and schools, Kongtrül was known to promote a shentong view of emptiness as the highest view. \n\nHis view of Prasangika Madhyamaka is outlined in the following verse from the \"Treasury of Knowledge\": Conceptual imputations are abandoned; all things are merely designations. Compounded phenomena are deceptive; nirvana is not deceptive. The root of samsara is clinging to true existence, which generates the obscuration of the afflictive emotions. Since the first three yanas have the same way of seeing reality, there is only one path of seeing.All phenomena dissolve such that ones enlightenment only appears for the perception of others.According to Kongtrül, the difference between prasangika and svatantrika Madhyamaka is:These schools differ in the way the ultimate view is generated in one's being. There is no difference in what they assert the ultimate nature to be. All the great scholars who are unbiased say that both of these schools are authentic Madhyamaka.Kongtrül also held that \"Shentong Madhyamaka\" was a valid form of Madhyamaka, which was also based on the Buddha nature teachings of the third turning and Nagarjuna's \"Collection of Praises\". For him, this Shentong Madhyamaka is the view which holds that the Ultimate truth, the \"primordial wisdom nature, the dharmata\":always exists in its own nature and never changes, so it is never empty of its own nature and it is there all the time.However, he makes it clear that \"The Shentong view is free of the fault of saying that the ultimate is an entity.\" Furthermore, Kongtrül states:The ultimate truth is the primordial wisdom of emptiness free of elaborations. Primordial wisdom is there in its very nature and is present within the impure, mistaken consciousness. Even while consciousness is temporarily stained, it remains in the wisdom nature. The defilements are separable and can be abandoned because they are not the true nature. Therefore, the ultimate truth is also free of the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism. Since emptiness is truly established, then the extreme of nihilism is avoided; and since all phenomena and concepts of subject-object grasping do not truly exist, then the extreme of eternalism is avoided.\n\nFinally, on the difference between Rangtong and Shentong, Kongtrül writes in the \"Treasury of Knowledge\":For both Rangtong and Shentong the relative level is empty, and in meditation, all fabricated extremes have ceased. However, they differ in their terminology about whether dharmata is there or not there in post-meditation, and in the ultimate analysis, whether primordial wisdom is truly established or not.\n\nShentong says that if the ultimate truth had no established nature and was a mere absolute negation, then it would be a vacuous nothingness. Instead, the ultimate is nondual, self-aware primordial wisdom. Shentong presents a profound view which joins the sutras and tantras.\n\nThe main corpus of Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye vast scholarly activities (comprising more than ninety volumes of works in all) is known as the Great Treasuries:\n\n\nJamgon Kongtrul's (1813–1899) 'The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge' () consists of ten books or sections and is itself a commentary on the root verses 'The Encompassment of All Knowledge' () which is also the work of Jamgon Kongtrul. \"The Encompassment of All Knowledge\" are the root verses to Kongtrul's autocommentary \"The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge\" and these two works together are known as 'The Treasury of Knowledge' (). Tibetan Text\n\nOf the Five, the Treasury of Knowledge was Jamgon Kongtrul's \"magnum opus\", covering the full spectrum of Buddhist history, philosophy and practice. There is an ongoing effort to translate it into English. It is divided up as follows:\n\n• \"The Great Path of Awakening : The Classic Guide to Using the Mahayana Buddhist Slogans to Tame the Mind and Awaken the Heart\"\ntranslated by Ken McLeod, Shambhala, 2000. \n\n• \"Buddha Nature, The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra with Commentary\"\nArya Maitreya, with commentary by Jamgon Kongrul Lodro Thaye and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, Snow Lion, 200. \n\n• \"Cloudless Sky\"\ncommentary by Jamgon Kongrul the Third.\nShambhala, 2001. \n\n• \"Jamgon Kongtrul's Retreat Manual\"\ntranslated by Ngawang Zangpo.

(restricted circulation)\n\nThere have been several recognized tulkus (incarnations) of Lodro Thaye.\n\nThe biography of Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama mentions he had a vision in which he saw 25 simultaneous emanations of the master Jamgön Kongtrül. Preeminent among these was Karsé Kongtrül (, 1904–10 May 1952). Karsé Kongtrül was born as the son of the 15th Karmapa: \"Karsé\" means \"son of the Karmapa\". His formal religious name was as Jamyang Khyentsé Özer ().\n\nKarsé Kongtrül was identified and enthroned by his father at age twelve in 1902, in Samdrub Choling at the monastery of Dowolung Tsurphu. Karsé Kongtrül resided at Tsadra Rinchen Drak, the seat of his predecessor in eastern Tibet. He received the full education and lineage transmission from the Karmapa. Among his other teachers were Surmang Trungpa Chökyi Nyinche, the 10th Trungpa tulku. He attained realization of the ultimate lineage, was one of the most renowned Mahamudra masters and transmitted the innermost teachings to Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa. On many occasions he gave teachings, empowerments, and reading transmissions from the old and new traditions, such as the \"Treasury of Precious Termas\" (\"Rinchen Terdzö\"), and he rebuilt the retreat center of Tsandra Rinchen Drak, his residence at Palpung Monastery. Karsé Kongtrül died on 10 May 1952 at the age of 49.\nThe 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, Karma Lodrö Chökyi Senge, a tulku of Khyentse Özer, was born on 1 October 1954. He fled to India in 1959 in the aftermath of the 1959 Tibetan uprising and grew up at Rumtek Monastery under the care of Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa. Following the Karmapa's death, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul was actively involved in the search for the Karmapa’s successor. However, he died in a car accident on 26 April 1992 before the search could be completed.\n\n\"Recognition by 17th Karmapa, Orgyen Trinley Dorje\"- \nThe 4th Jamgon Kongtrul, Lodro Choyki Nyima Tenpey Dronme, was born in the wood pig year in Central Tibet on the 26th of November 1995. His birth was prophesied by The Seventeenth Karmapa, Ögyen Trinley Dorje, who also recognised, confirmed the authenticity of his incarnation, and proclaimed it to the world. The prophecy, the search, and the recognition of the Fourth Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche are told in the book E MA HO! published by the Jamgon Kongtrul Labrang and can be obtained from Pullahari Monastery and viewed on www.jamgonkongtrul.org. He spent time between Kagyu Tekchen Ling and Pullahari Monastery, the monastic seats in India and Nepal founded by the Third Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche. Jamgon Kongtrul Labrang gave his studies, training, and the receiving transmissions from the Lineage Masters. Annually, he also attended the Kagyu Monlam in Bodhgaya, India, led by the Seventeenth Gyalwa Karmapa, and led the Kagyu Monlam in Kathmandu, Nepal. On April 14 2016, the Jamgon Yangsi left Pullahari monastery and his monastic vows, stating he wanted to pursue his 'dream of becoming a doctor'. \n\nThe 4th Jamgon Kongtrul Mingyur Drakpa Senge was born on 17 December, 1995 in Nepal.\n\nThe day before he was born, the late Chogye Trichen Rinpoche said in front of many Lamas and Tulkus: “Like prophesied ... today Jamgon Rinpoche arrived.”\n\nIn 1996, when the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje, arrived in Bodhgaya, when he met the young Jamgon Rinpoche for the first time. Yangsi Rinpoche despite his young age was able to spontaneously pick up some rice and toss it into the air as a mandala offering, Straight away he exclaimed: “This is the Jamgon Yangsi (Reincarnation) indeed!” He then issued a recognition letter and gave him a name Karma Migyur Drakpa Senge Trinley Kunkhyab Palzangpo.\n\nIn 1998, when the Dalai Lama was visiting Bodhgaya, the Yangsi Rinpoche had a private audience with him, where they showed him the recognition letter and the 14th Dalai Lama performed the hair cutting ceremony for the 4th Jamgon Yangsi. In 2000, Drubwang Pema Norbu (Penor Rinpoche), was invited to the Karma Monastery in Bodhgaya, and he performed the vast and profound enthronement ceremony of 4th Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, again reconfirmed Jamgon Yangsi as reincarnation of the great\n\nIn addition to Karsey Kongtrul Khyentsé Özer (1904–1953) (the principal incarnation), there were four other reincarnations of the first Jamgon Kongtrul: Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, Dzogchen Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Shechen Kongtrul Rinpoche. Kalu Rinpoche, also recognized post-facto as the incarnation of Lodrö Thaye's activity, was never enthroned as such. \nAccording to the 15th Karmapa, there were 25 simultaneous reincarnations.\n\n"}
{"id": "1796519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796519", "title": "Uruapan", "text": "Uruapan\n\nUruapan is the second largest city in the Mexican state of Michoacán. It is located at the western edge of the Purépecha highlands, just to the east of the Tierra Caliente Region. Since the colonial period, it has been an important city economically due its location. The city was conquered by the Spanish in 1522, when the last Purépecha ruler fled the Pátzcuaro area to here. The modern city was laid out in 1534 by Friar Juan de San Miguel. It played an important role in the War of Independence, and was the capital of Michoacán during the French Intervention. Today it is the center of Mexico's avocado growing region, with most of the crop distributed from here nationally and internationally.\n\nWith a population of over 264,000. The city is the second most populous and the second in economic importance in the state of Michoacán. The city is located at the western edge of the Purépecha highlands of the state at 1,620 meters above sea level.\n\nThe city's center has colonial architecture which contain Plateresque and Moorish elements. There are six historic neighborhoods of the city: San Miguel, San Pedro, San Francisco, Santa Maria Magdalena, San Juan Bautista and Santo Santiago, all of which have colonial-era chapels in their centers. Each of these neighborhoods have their own festival: San José on March 19, El Vergel on the third Friday in June, San Juan Quemado on June 24, San Pedro on June 29, La Magdalena on July 22, Santo Santiago on July 25, San Miguel on September 29, San Francisco de Asis on October 4. The patron saints’ days of these neighborhoods are celebrated with colorful dances such as Los Negritos.\n\nThe center of the city is marked by the very large and very long Plaza de Martires de Uruapan. Facing this plaza are two commercial portals as well as some of the city's most important landmarks. On the north side, there is the La Huatápera Museum, officially called the Museo de los Cuatro Pueblos Indios. Huatápera is a Purépecha word, meaning “meeting place,” and according to tradition, it was built over a pre Hispanic platform, obtaining its social importance from this. Originally the site was a hospital called Hospital Real de la Purísima Concepción established by Juan de San Miguel in 1533, the first of its kind in the Americas. It functioned not only to heal the sick but also as a center for evangelism and to organize workers by trade.It has a chapel called Santo Entierro, with fine stonework in cantera in Plateresque style. Above the chapel's arch, there is a niche which contains a sculpture of either Francis of Assisi or Juan de San Miguel flanked by the coats of arms of the Franciscans and the Spanish crown. The interior is restored and contains images of angels playing musical instruments and important people from the history of the Catholic Church. The rest of the complex shows Moorish influence and houses a collection of handcrafts from the various indigenous communities of the state. Just to the east of Huatápera is the Immaculate Concepción church, which was built in the late 20th century. It has a cantera portal finished in the 1970s but no cupola nor bell tower.\n\nThe Casa de Cultura (Cultural Center) is located on the western side of Huatápera. It was built in 1992 over what was the Franciscan monastery established by Juan de San Miguel. The original church of this monastery is now the parish church for the city. Built in 1533, it maintains its 16th century Plateresque portal, and the interior of the church has a crucifix that dates from the 18th century. The paintings on the triangular spaces just under the cupola represent salvation and the miracle of the Mass, done by Mohamed Socidel.\n\nBehind this line of monuments is a market called the Mercado de Antojitos, whose stalls are dedicated to the sale of prepared traditional foods such as carnitas, barbacoas, quesadillas and the like.\n\nThe western side of the city is home to the Barranca del Cupatitzio National Park, the second most-visited national park in Mexico. Despite being almost completely surrounded by the city, the park contains trees hundreds of years old, springs, streams, canals and walking paths. The park focuses on the conservation of the ravine which forms the headwaters of the Cupatitzio River, which is fed by various springs and streams starting with the “Rodilla del Diablo” (Devil's Knee) . According to local myth, Juan de San Miguel forced the Devil to bow before the Cross, with the Devil's knee making an indentation in the rock from which the first spring emerges. The land was private until the 1930s when the federal government bought it to create the park. The ravine has various waterfalls such as La Yerbabuena and El Golgota, bridges and fountains that take advantage of natural water supply. There is also a mural called Erédira by local artist Manuel Pérez Coronado, but it is almost completely deteriorated.\n\nThe San Pedro Factory is a still-operational textile factory built in the late 19th century, when the city was at its industrial peak. Construction of the mill began in 1886, originally to work with cotton but later expanded to other fibers, such as linen and silk. The factory is still in operation but not to the same capacity as in the past. The current owners maintain the more handcrafted feel of the products making bedspreads, tablecloths, napkins and more. Part of the complex is now used for cultural and other events.\n\nThe city is home to the narrowest house in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Located at 50-C Carrillo Puerto, it measures 1.40 by 7.70 meters.\n\nThe Palm Sunday Handcraft Market is held during Holy Week with the most important day being Palm Sunday, after which it is named. It covered the city large main square and attracts over a thousand artisans who sell. In addition to traditional observances for Day of the Dead, the city has sponsored the Festival de Velas on the same days, where candles are arranged and lit to form figures at the Martires de Uruapan and Morelos plazas as well as on adjoining streets. There an Avocado Festival from mid November to mid December which consists of exhibitions and cultural events.\n\nThe city's cuisine is influenced not only by the various ethnic groups in the area but also migration from other parts of Michoacan. Typical dishes include corundas, churipo (a beef and vegetable stew), mutton barbacoa, carnitas, quesadillas with squash flowers, flour tamales, various flavors of sweet and spicy atole, hot chocolate, uchepos, sweet potatoes and plantains cooked in various ways and more.\n\nThe city of the Uruapan is the seat of a municipality and serves as the local government for surrounding communities that extend over 954.17km2. Outside of the Uruapan proper, the main communities are Capacuaro, Angahuan, San, Caltzontzin, Jucutacato, Santa, Corupo and Nuevo, all of which are dedicated to agriculture and/or forestry. The municipality borders those of Charapan, Paracho, Nahuatzen, Tingambato, Ziracuaretiro, Taretan, Gabriel Zamora, Nuevo Parangaricutiro, Peribán and Los Reyes. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a syndic, and 12 representatives called regidors.\n\nThe municipality has a population of over 315,000, of which 18,020 speak an indigenous language, mostly Purépecha. Traditional music is mostly influenced by the Purépecha culture with pirecuas and sons, as well as those played by wind instruments.\n\nThe El Sabino Zoocriadero is home to various exotic species. It is 17 km outside the city in an area that has a warmer climate. Its main attraction is its crocodiles but it also has lions, badgers, deer, ostriches and turtles.\n\nSince the colonial period, the area has been an agricultural center growing bananas, chicozapote, mamey, limes, oranges, lemons, avocados and more. Today, the city is the second most important economically in the state of Michoacán, with a very low level of socioeconomic marginalization. About 12.5% live in extreme poverty, with thirteen communities with about 350 who are extremely marginalized from social services.\n\nThe city is surrounded by avocado and macadamia orchards. It is located in the most productive regions in Mexico for avocado. It is called the world capital of avocado not because of the production in the municipality but because it is home of six packing companies to which the region sends its avocados for distribution. From here, avocados are shipped all over Mexico and exported to the United States, Central America, Europe and Japan. In 2000, the city made the Guinness Book of World Records creating the largest batch of guacamole, making 1,288 kilograms of the dip, from one ton of fresh avocados.\n\nNative to Australia, macadamias have been grown in the Uruapan area since the late 20th century. The city makes a number of products from the nut such as nuts flavored with garlic, chili peppers, soy sauce or salt. They are also made into brittle, cookies, candies and oil.\n\nSince the colonial period, the city has been a center of the production of maque, an indigenous form of lacquer, used to wooden items such as plates, platters, boxes, chests and dried gourds. Other handcrafts produced here include masks, papel picado, and textiles.\n\nThe municipality has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cwa\" in the Koppen climate classification) with very wet summers, dry winters and lush forests. It is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and mountainous. Principal peaks include Charanda, La Cruz, Jicalán and Magdalena. The climate is between temperate and tropical, with most rain falling in the summer. Average annual rainfall is 1,759.3 mm and average annual temperatures are between 8 and 37.5 C. The flora is mostly mixed forest, with pine, oak and deciduous tropical rainforest. Logging includes pine, oak and oyamel fir. Areas without trees mostly consist of scrub of various kinds. Notable fauna includes coyote, skunks, deer, foxes, cacomixtle, hares, opossums, ducks and other birds. \nThe municipality contains numerous small rivers that belongs to the Tepalcatepec basin. The main river is the Cupatitzio. Other important bodies of water include the Caltzontzin Reservoir (also known as the Santa Barbara or Santa Catarina) and waterfalls such as Salto Escondido, Cupatitzio and La Tzaráracua.\n\nThe La Tzararacua Ecotourism Center is located 10 km south of the city proper, centered on a 40-meter high waterfall of the same name. Next to this is the Tzararcuita (Little Tzararacua), at 16 meters high.\n\nThe name comes from the Purépecha word \"uruapani\" which means plants that flower and fruit at the same time or those which are always giving fruit. The coat of arms was designed by Luis Valencia Madrigal and represents the history of the area since the pre Hispanic period as well as its natural resources.\n\nUruapan was a pre Hispanic settlement, inhabited primarily by Purépechas. Much of the history is unknown with numerous unexcavated archeological sites. The oldest document about the area is the Lienzo de Jucutacato, found in the community of Jicalán. It is known that the area was conquered in 1400 by an alliance of the lords of Pátzcuaro, Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatzio.\n\nWhen the Spanish invaded the Purépecha Empire, the last ruler fled to Uruapan, leading the Spanish here in 1522. For this reason the Spanish arrived here in 1522. In 1524, the area became an encomienda under Francisco de Villegas and evangelized by the Franciscans.\n\nFranciscan friar Juan de San Miguel is considered the founder of the modern city, tracing it out in 1534 into nine neighborhoods, each with its own chapel and patron saint, and assigned who would live in each one. In 1540 the area became an Indian Republic.\n\nDuring the colonial period, the city was a strategic location, especially for commerce, between the Purépecha highlands and the Tierra Caliente leading down to the coast.\n\nIn 1577 a plague decimated the population.\n\nBy 1754, the parish of Uruapan consisted of the city of Uruapan, three towns (San Francisco Xicalán, San Francisco Jucutacato and San Lorenzo) along with two ranches Tiamba and San Marcos along with the Carasa Hacienda. The population was a mix of Purépecha, European, African and mixed races peoples.\n\nIn 1766, the population revolted against efforts by the Spanish to recruit the population into military service. This was followed by repression and punishment of various persons by execution in 1767, both for the resistance of the prior year and protests against the expulsion of the Jesuits.\n\nFrom 1795 to 1798, insurgent José María Morelos lived here. During the war, the city served as a refuge various times for insurgents, include local José María Izazaga.\n\nIn 1806, an earthquake destroyed the hospital, and in 1817, the city was burned.\n\nUruapan officially became a municipality in 1831. For its role in the War of Independence, it was named a \"Ciuda del Progreso\" (City of Progress) in 1858.\n\nIn 1842, the city supported the rule of Antonio López de Santa Anna.\n\nBecause of the French Intervention, the Uruapan was the temporary capital of Michoacan from 1863 to 1867. In 1864, French troops entered and subdued the city. In 1865, General José María Arteaga, head of the Republican Army and four other officers were executed by firing squad, and are known as the Martyrs of Uruapan. In 1866 the Republicans tried to liberate the city from the French at the Battle of Magdalena but were defeated.\n\nThe first textile factory was set up in the city in 1874, and the first local newspaper, \"El Precursor Uruapense\" was founded in 1880. The first railroad line reached the city in 1899, and a trolley line was built between the rail station and the main plaza in 1900.\n\nIn 1910, a fire destroyed several factories in the city.\n\nThe city was attacked several times during the Mexican Revolution, the most notable of which were led by Joaquín Amaro. In the 1930s, efforts to redistribute agricultural land began.\n\nIn 1947, the Tepalcatepec Commission was created which modernized the area's economy as well as infrastructure.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the city has had problems with organized crime, along with much of the rest of the state. Two criminal organizations, Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, have fought for control here, because of its geographic location among drug routes. In 2014, the city was taken over briefly by the Grupos de Autodefensa Comunitaria or \"autodefensas\", an armed civilian movement trying to counter the power of the cartels, unsupported by the local and state government. In August 2019, 19 people were murdered by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.\n\n\n"}

The tower quickly became a symbol and source of pride of both Odense and the entire island of Funen. Visitors said they could see the entire island from its observation platforms. If this statement is true, it was possible to see more than away.\n\nConstruction of the tower took 30 tons of steel, 2,700 tons of concrete, and half a million kroner, a considerable amount of money at the time. The tower had two platforms. The first, located 70 metres (230 ft) above ground, was a restaurant featuring a great star-shaped room with low, broad windows, a buffet, and seats for 160 guests. Its roof was decorated with a great compass card with a map of Odense in the centre, surrounded by directions to all towns on the island. Each town was indicated by its direction, name, and coat of arms.\n\nA second platform was located 140 metres (460 ft) above ground, with an even greater view. From here, a spiral staircase offered access to the Conch Bar (), the name inspired by the staircase. Tables were located with one on each step of the staircase.\n\nThe tower's kitchen was suspended beneath the restaurant on the first platform and considered to be very modern. The tower was a popular tourist attraction and in 1935 alone, it attracted more than 213,000 visitors, including many foreigners. It was also a favourite playground for model airplane enthusiasts.\n\nThe Odin Tower was blown up on 06:15 AM on 14 December 1944 by a group of Danish Nazi saboteurs called the Peter group under the leadership of Henning E. Brøndum, in a so-called act of Schalburgtage. The tower collapsed completely and was damaged beyond repair. It took two months to remove the scrap metal and almost ten years to remove the concrete.\n\nOn 29 May 2004, the 69th anniversary of the inauguration of the original tower, students of the Odense Technical College (\"Odense Tekniske Gymnasium\") erected a replica of the destroyed tower on its original site.\n\n"}

{"id": "1796535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796535", "title": "A Lesson Before Dying", "text": "A Lesson Before Dying\n\nA Lesson Before Dying is Ernest J. Gaines' eighth novel, published in 1993. While it is a fictional work, it is loosely based on the true story of Willie Francis, a young black man sentenced to death by the electric chair twice in Louisiana, in 1945 and 1947.\n\nThe story begins with the murder of Mr. Grope by two black men. An innocent bystander named Jefferson is charged with and convicted of the murder. He is sentenced to death. In his trial, Jefferson's attorney explains to the jury \"What justice would there be to take his life? Justice, gentlemen? Why, I would as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this.\" That statement causes Jefferson to believe that he is indeed a hog, not a man. Jefferson's godmother Miss Emma Glenn, and Tante Lou, the local schoolteacher, ask Lou's nephew Grant Wiggins to turn Jefferson from a \"hog\" to a \"man.\" However, they must first get permission from Sheriff Sam Guidry, who is racist. To accomplish that, they successfully ask Sheriff Guidry's brother-in-law Henri Pichot for assistance.\n\nWhen Grant is not there, Miss Emma, Tante Lou, and Reverend Ambrose also visit Jefferson. Over the course of the novel, Grant and Jefferson form a close friendship. Unusual for the time, Grant also forms a friendship with Deputy Paul Bonin. In early February, it is announced that Jefferson will be executed on April 8. Around then, Reverend Ambrose becomes concerned that Grant, an agnostic, is not teaching Jefferson about God and thus begins visiting him regularly. The conflict reaches a head when Grant buys Jefferson a radio, which the seniors in the black community, or \"quarter,\" see as sinful. The novel ends with Jefferson's execution and, much to Grant's surprise, a visit from Paul in which he tells Grant that \"Jefferson was the strongest man in that crowded room\" when he was executed.\n\nThe reader is given a unique outlook on the status of African Americans in the South after World War II and before the Civil Rights Movement. We see a Jim Crow South through the eyes of a formally educated African American teacher who often feels helpless and alienated from his own country. In \"A Lesson Before Dying,\" Grant is the only educated black man in the area and the only member of the black community who might be considered capable of becoming free of overt oppression. Nevertheless, his life and career choices are severely limited and he must refer to white male authority figures as \"Sir.\" Because of this, he yearns to leave his disheartening situation. Grant feels that he is cornered by myriad forces: his aunt's incessant wants, pressure to conform to a fundamentalist religion that he does not believe, the children's need for a teacher, and the community's need for leadership. Summed up, Grant can leave and could make a good life for himself if he does, but he doesn't because he feels trapped.\n\nThis book can be dated based on close reading from chapter 12 when the book mentions Jackie Robinson. The quote \"All three stood talking baseball. Jackie Robinson had just finished his second year with the Brooklyn Dodgers,\" tells us all that we need to know to date this book. The book takes place in early October 1948.\n\n\"All there was to see were old white weather-houses, with smoke rising out of the chimneys and drifting across the corrugated tin roofs overlooking the yard toward the field, where some of the cane had been cut. The cane had not been hauled to the derrick yet, and it was lying across the rows. A little farther over, where another patch of cane was standing, tall and blue-green, you could see the leaves swaying softly from a breeze. <br>\n\n“Left of the weighing scales and the derrick was the plantation cemetery, where my ancestors had been buried for the past century. The cemetery had lots of trees in it, pecans and oaks, and it was weedy too.”\n\n“My classroom was the church. My desk was a table, used as a collection table by the church on Sundays, and also used for the service of the Holy Sacrament. My students’ desks were the benches upon which their parents and grandparents sat during church meeting. Ventilation into the church was by way of the four windows on either side, and from the front and back doors. There was a blackboard on the back wall. Behind my desk was the pulpit and the altar. This was my school.”\n\nGrant, an agnostic, spends most of his time in the church on the Henry Pichot Plantation. The school that he teaches in is the same place in which the town gathers on Sunday morning for praise and worship. Grant is continually challenged with the fact that he is an outsider in his place of work; he does not attend church with the rest of his settlement. Throughout the entire novel, this school is seen as a place of discrimination. Segregated schools provide another example of racial persecution.\n\nDespite Grant's personal atheism, much of the black culture and community focus on religion. This occasionally annoys Grant.\n\n\"Bayonne was a small town of about six thousand. Approximately three thousand five hundred whites; approximately two thousand five hundred colored. It was the parish seat for St. Raphael. The courthouse was there; so was the jail. There was a Catholic church uptown for whites; a Catholic church back of town for colored. There was a white movie theater uptown; a colored movie theater back of town. There were two elementary schools uptown, one Catholic, one public, for whites; and the same ]red. Bayonne’s major industries were a cement plant, a sawmill, and a slaughterhouse, mostly for hogs. There was only one main street in Bayonne, and it ran along the St. Charles River.\"\nBayonne is an actual city in France, but also the fictional Louisiana town depicted in the novel.\n\n\"We followed him down a long, dark corridor, passing offices with open doors, and bathrooms for white ladies and white men. At the end of the corridor we had to go up a set of stairs. The stairs were made of steel. There were six steps, then a landing, a sharp turn, and another six steps. Then we went through a heavy steel door to the area where the prisoners were quartered. The white prisoners were also on this floor, but in a separate section. I counted eight cells for black prisoners, with two bunks to each cell. Half of the cells were empty, the others had one or two prisoners. They reached their hands out between the bars and asked for cigarettes or money. Miss Emma . She told them she didn’t have any money, but she had brought some food for Jefferson, and if there was anything left she would give it to them. They asked me for money, and I gave them the change I had.\" \n\n\"The cell was roughly six by ten, with a metal bunk covered by a thin mattress and a woolen army blanket; a toilet without seat or toilet paper; a washbowl, brownish from residue and grime; a small metal shelf upon which was a pan, a tin cup, and a tablespoon. A single bulb hung over the center of the cell, and at the end opposite the door was a barred window, which looked out onto a sycamore tree behind the courthouse. I could see the sunlight on the upper leaves. But the window was too high to catch sight of any other buildings or the ground.\"\n\nConstructive lying is a remedy commonly used in the novel 'A Lesson Before Dying'. It is especially used by Grant, Jefferson and Reverend Ambrose.\n\nThe aim of constructive lying is mainly to spare others from pain by keeping the truth from them.\n\nWhen Jefferson talks to Grant with the help of constructive lying this expresses his hopelessness. Another intention of him is to build distance.\n\nAnother instance of constructive lying can be found between Grant and Miss Emma. Grant deliberately avoids the conversation with Miss Emma to think of a suitable lie first. Furthermore, he cleverly steers the conversation in another direction. During his conversation with Miss Emma after his visit to Jefferson, Grant lies and tries to present Jefferson in a good light.\n\nWhen Grant visits Jefferson, he is displeased because he does not eat the food of his godmother Miss Emma. Knowing that Miss Emma is being in a bad health condition Grant decides not to tell Miss Emma about this incident and rather lie by telling her what she wishes to hear about her godson. These lies can be seen as constructive since they aim to prevent Miss Emma from getting hurt. However, later on, Miss Emma realizes that Grant lied to her because when she visited Jefferson, the picture Grant painted of him did not match reality. Therefore, in retrospective, the constructive lie created more pain than the truth.\n\nGrant uses constructive lying to present himself better and thus meet the expectations of others.\n\nFinally, Reverend Ambrose appeals to Grant that constructive lying is necessary. He refers to Aunt Lou and lists what she \"accepted\" earlier for Grant.\n\nThe church has a great impact on the community. It is not only to integrate a person to be a complete part of the group, but also to define someone's worth. The belief in God strengthens the members of the community and helps them cope with the adversities of life. In addition an early part of the children's life is strongly influenced by religious education in school.\n\nEven though the teacher Grant Wiggins is not religious, he struggles with the question of what to believe in. His absence at the church on Sundays is not only an act of rebellion, but it also shows an ongoing process of reflection. In the following, it becomes clear that Grant's belief in God and his urge to remain truthful are strongly related to the belief in existence. His sources of hope are the loving relationships within this life\".\" Still, he detects too much injustice and hopelessness to agree with the idea of a universally applicable God. Grant feels trapped by the unjust system of racial discrimination. Therefore, he develops some cynical manners: Instead of seeing the spark of potential, he observes the predetermined future of his students. Still the reader watches Grant grow and realizes that he does teach Jefferson a lot about human dignity and hope that can be found in earthly existence.\n\nReverend Ambrose, in contrast, is described as a simple and devoted believer and embodies a very important member of the quarter. Ambrose finds his hope and drive in religion. Therefore, he is capable to bear not only personal issues but to stand by others in their pain. While this makes him a consistent character, he also stands out due to his lack of criticism against the earthly circumstances. In addition to that, the reverend presents a black-and-white mindset regarding anything opposing his beliefs.\n\nThose two opposing characters both influence the young prisoner strongly. While Grant explains earthly concepts of dignity, hope and pride to the living Jefferson, the reverend donates the religious hope for the executed one. The young man manages to combine a strong belief in his worth with confidence in whatever might come. In consequence Jefferson “takes the cross”.\n\nTante Lou\n\nTante Lou is a large black woman in her early to mid-70s. She cared for Grant Wiggins when his parents left him and brought him up as a child. That strengthens her image of a maternal figure. Her best friend is Miss Emma Glenn, the godmother of Jefferson. The two women dress respectfully and try to resist and overcome racism in Bayonne County. Tante Lou finds freedom for her soul in her deeply religious faith in God and the church. Being linked up with this fact, her family is very important to her and her dignity and pride are where she gets her power and motivation from. Although she often says hard, cold words to Grant she loves him like her son and does not want to lose him to another woman. That is why she is very cool towards Vivian (Grant's girlfriend). Tante Lou plays a major role in motivating and guiding Grant. She is the one who demands Grant speaking with the Pichots in order to gain visitation rights at the prison and always wants him to help Jefferson. Therefore, Tante Lou can be seen as a positive force in Grant's life and the community. Tante Lou can be made responsible for Grant's development because she always claims him for being true to himself, knowing that failure to do so would ruin him. She is a powerful and strong woman who is very self-confident. She cannot be influenced very well what makes her a difficult dialogue partner. But in the end, Tante Lou is very important for Grant and his attitude towards Jefferson. Without Tante Lou, the novel would miss one of the most important side protagonists.\n\nMiss Emma Glenn\n\nMiss Emma is a black woman in her mid-70s. She has grey hair, which is comped up and pinned on top. She is of average height but weighs nearly 200 pounds. \nMoreover, she has a close relationship with Tante Lou, who supports Miss Emma's plans to ask Mr Pichot's brother-in-law, the sheriff, if Grant is allowed to visit Jefferson in jail. In her past, she worked as a cook for Mr Pichot's family.\nMiss Emma is a deeply religious, churchgoing woman who wants her godson Jefferson to die like a man, which is why she asks Grant to visit him in jail. She presents herself as determined for achieving her aim. She hopes to get Mr Pichot's help and pursues her goal persistent. Thanks to her stubbornness, Miss Emma gets Mr Pichot's promise that he will try to help her. In public, Miss Emma hides her feelings which you can tell from her behaviour in the courtroom. She seems to be absent-minded and just stares in front of her as if she was „a great stone “. One can say that Miss Emma is a controlled, strong-willed and dignified woman who pursues her aims with persistence.\n\nVivian Baptiste\n\nVivian Baptiste is Grant's girlfriend. She has children and is still married to another man but they are in the divorcing progress. She is not as outspoken and overbearing as Miss Emma and Tante Lou but Vivian is definitely a strong black woman. In many instances, her strength emphasizes Grant's weakness. She has defied her family by marrying a dark-skinned black man, even though her action causes her to be ostracized from her family. Although she loves Grant she does not hesitate to point out his shortcomings, tactfully, without challenging his male ego. Vivian is a lady, refusing to let Grant take advantage of her. After nursing his wounds following his barroom brawl, she gives him an ultimatum: Unless he is willing to show her some consideration, she will leave him. Vivian is a mother, teacher, and lover and is totally aware of her responsibilities. For Vivian being a teacher indicts to be a leader and role model. Vivian takes an active role in trying to change the status quo. Her goal is to instil hope in her students for a brighter future and a life outside the limited plantation community. She does this by building their self-esteem and helping them become contributing members of the community,\n\nEdna Guidry\n\nEdna Guidry is the sheriff's wife. She is an extremely kind woman with a deep heart and ability to sympathize people. Actually, this woman is one of the rare characters in the book that can deeply and sincerely sympathize with black people. Being a wife of the sheriff, Edna makes all she can to better the position of Jefferson and let his people visiting him. The woman is not able to do much, but it is clear how crossed she is with the situation. One can notice how this situation touches her heart. It is important to mention that Edna sympathizes not only Jefferson. She is also crossed with the condition of the widow Grope. The woman does not take the one side protecting someone's rights. She just empathizes to those who are crossed and look broken. She is ready to hug Madame Grope, and at the same time, she sincerely asks Gran to say Miss Emma how sorry she is about Jefferson. Both sides have their pains and Edna is compassionate with all of them. Throughout the story Edna's addiction to drinks is noticeable. It is not accurately told but one can easily notice the hint on this condition.\n\nOccupation\n\n- Miss Emma: cooked at the Pichot house\n- Tante Lou: maid at the Pichot house\n- Vivian: teacher at a black catholic school in Bayonne\n- Edna Guidry: housewife\n- Shirley: waitress at Rainbow Club\n\nThey do not own leading roles in politics or community. Vivian is the only one who visited a university, the only one who experienced a further education. Due to their position in the community, they are not really capable of influencing the court.\n\nThe women in this novel are the moving roles. Without them the whole plot would not be happening because of their activity and them taking action. It is clear that Jefferson would have died like a “hog” if it was not for Tante Lou and Ms Emma. \nThe feminine characters like Vivian are mainly responsible for the outcome of the situation. She convinces Grant to stay in Bayonne which allows Jefferson a death in dignity. \nTante Lou and Emma Glenn treat Grant and Jefferson like their maternal children and care selflessly for their family members.\nThanks to Edna Guidry sympathizing with the other women it is possible for them to visit Jefferson. Ms Emma is the first black woman having tea in the house of the white sheriff which conducts that gender, for woman, creates bridges across the racial segregation.\nThe Feminine is desired to keep their communities stable.\nEmma, Lou and Vivian sacrifice their happiness for other's sake. Women seem more endeavoured to help others than men in this novel.\n\nGrant states: “A hero is someone who does something for other people. He does something that other men don´t and can´t do. He is different from other men. He is above other men. No matter who those other men are, the hero, no matter who he is, is above them.”\n\nThese examples of feminine behaviour named above fit this definition of heroism. Gaines portrays them as strong people with a mind of their own. They do everything to help and support their beloved ones and take care of things. \nBesides that, they suffer under the conditions in their community and the racial segregation but even in this state, they keep their heads held up high.\nGains presents women as an important part of the family and community who hold everything together but at the same time experience e a lot of pain and hard work.\n\nThe theme of education is omnipresent throughout the novel especially through the role of the narrator Grant Wiggins – the teacher of the local elementary school. He is assigned by the “white folks around here” to teach the basics of knowledge like reading, writing and math in the heavily underfunded all-black school, the church serves as a classroom. His teaching methods are, as was probably normal at that time, very strict and brutal.\n\nAfter receiving higher education in university, he returned to his home community. Now seeing no progress in the future chances of his students, he feels frustrated and wonders about the relevance of the education since his students are likely to work like their families on plantations captured in the cycle of poverty and racism. He believes that Jefferson alone can break this circle by showing everyone that change is possible. (Despite attending university Grant himself is captured in the cycle and unsatisfied with his life.\n\nEducation is also depicted as a root for frustration for another reason. In contrast to this academic education, Gaines continues the theme in Grant's task to teach Jefferson morality. Jefferson is a young man that was sentenced to death for a crime that he hadn't committed. During the process, the defence argued Jefferson was a hog that couldn't be judged like a man. Grant Wiggins has the task to morally transform his former student from a hog into a man. In that task, he is rivalled by reverend Ambrose, who thinks only the church can save Jefferson's Soul. The student-teacher relationship shifts from frontal teaching to an exchange between Grant and Jefferson. Facing the difficult task of teaching morality, Grant is reliant on Jefferson's on will. During the process, he discovers bit by bit how Jefferson opens himself to him and by that how he can reach him, and how to teach him to be a man.\n\nThe term \"inescapable path“ and its meaning is quite illustrative for the novel. The main character Jefferson is trapped in his hopeless situation due to his sentence to the death penalty. Moreover, he can not withdraw from the encounters he has with the other main character Grant Wiggins, which also leaves the circumstances as inescapable. \n\nGrant Wiggins finds himself as well in an ineluctable position, where he would rather leave the town of Bayonne, but is constantly reminded of his commitments, regarding his students, his aunt and his partner Vivian. Furthermore, Grant sees society’s issues with racism as fairly graved when he realizes that corporately nothing progressed over the time being when he went to university: \n\n\"I had not come through that back door once since leaving for the university, ten years ago.“\n\nGrant feels like that apartheid is still the trigger for the social scissors in their society. An example therefore is the vicious circle in which the male African-American men are said not to be able to protect their wives because of slavery. By moving from the south and with that escaping this accusation, they are said to act driven by weakness. As a result, we have a so-called vicious circle.\n\nThat puts Grant in a rift. Either he resists the expectations of the white population and defends his \"race“ by staying or he fulfills his dream by moving but simultaneously satisfying them in their image of the Afro-American stereotype. \n\nSummarizing now the term „The inescapable path“ is very much relatable with the novel. Not only the already obvious indication such as Jefferson's situation but also other subliminal characteristics of the book describe that topic very well.\n\nThe title of this novel is imperative in understanding one of the major themes. The entire book focuses on Grant's attempts to teach Jefferson a lesson. In order for Grant to be able to show Jefferson how to ‘become a man,’ he must himself understand the meaning. Symbolically, the butterfly towards the end of the novel is proof that both of these men have succeeded in their goals. \n\n“I probably would not have noticed it at all had not a butterfly, a yellow butterfly with dark spots like ink dots on its wings, not lit there. What had brought it there? …I watched it fly over the ditch and down into the quarter, I watched it until I could not see it anymore. Yes, I told myself. It is finally over.”\n\nAt this point Grant realizes that Jefferson really did learn a ‘lesson before dying.’ When he says “It is finally over,” he is not only referring to Jefferson's life, but also that his cowardly nature is “finally over.” He has once and for all taken a stand for what he believes in. This insures that he, too, has benefited from this entire experience. Jefferson's life was sacrificed in order for the white people in the community to gain a better understanding of the value of the black members of society.\n\n\nOn May 22, 1999 HBO premiered \"A Lesson Before Dying\", which subsequently received two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Made-for-Television Movie and Outstanding Writing for a Mini-Series or Movie (South African writer Ann Peacock) and a Peabody Award. Don Cheadle portrays Grant, Mekhi Phifer portrays Jefferson, and Cicely Tyson is featured as Tante Lou.\n\nA play by Romulus Linney and a Southern Writers' Project, based on the novel and having the same title, had its world premiere at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival in January 2000 and Off-Broadway in September 2000. Rooted Theater Company (East New York, Brooklyn) staged a production of \"A Lesson Before Dying\" in June 2017.\n\n"}

His nickname was \"Pancho\". He was a skilful forward who played in three FA Cup finals, two for Manchester United and one with West Ham United.\n\nPearson started his career with Hull City. He joined Manchester United in May 1974 for £200,000, with reserve player Peter Fletcher moving to Hull as part of the deal.\n\nPearson was bought by Manchester United after they were relegated to the Second Division and was instrumental in getting the club promoted back to the First Division the next season by scoring 17 goals. Every time he scored a goal he would celebrate with a raised right fist. He was in the team that lost 1–0 to Southampton in the 1976 FA Cup Final. The next year Pearson helped Manchester United win the 1977 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, scoring the first of Manchester United's goals in their 2–1 win. He was sidelined for most of the 1978–79 season due to a knee injury but made a full recovery before leaving Manchester United for West Ham United in August 1979.\n\nHe helped the Hammers win the 1980 FA Cup Final, with his cross-shot setting up Trevor Brooking for the only goal in a 1–0 win over Arsenal. During interviews after the game, Barry Davies described him as \"a big occasion player\" and suggested that but for his injuries he would have been England's finest striker.\n\nPearson retired from league football in 1982 due to a knee injury, but continued to play at a lower level, in South Africa and the NASL.\n\nHe won 15 caps for England between 1976 and 1978, scoring five goals.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Pearson moved into coaching, serving as coach of Stockport County in 1985–86 and manager of Northwich Victoria during the first half of 1986–87. He became assistant manager/coach at West Bromwich Albion in 1988 and acted as caretaker manager for six games in 1991 following Brian Talbot's departure. Pearson left Albion in 1992 and was assistant manager at Bradford City from 1992 to 1994. He has also been a pundit for MUTV. He moved to Spain in the mid-2000s.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first settled by the Germans in the 19th century.\n\nRussian biologist Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai was probably the first European to visit the area. In 1871 he stayed at Astrolabe Bay south of present-day Madang for 15 months. He had a good relationship with the local communities before leaving, suffering from malaria.\n\nIn April 1884 an expedition by the German New Guinea Company led by Otto Finsch and Eduard Dallmann arrived and named the landing point \"Friedrich Wilhelmshafen\"; however, they felt that the area was unsuitable for a settlement. A subsequent survey in 1888 mentioned good soil conditions that would make a coffee plantation possible. In the summer of 1891 a station was built and by September 1892 was the seat of the provincial administration; however, the Imperial Government Commissioner remained at Stephansort, some 23 kilometers away due to concerns about malaria. The name of \"Madang\" was used by Papuan natives who had accompanied the German administrators after their home island and only became the official name of the settlement towards the end of the German administration. Although the settlement was expanded from 1893-1894 with warehouses, a sawmill, hospital and other facilities, (including an ox-drawn railway to Stephansort) various ventures, such as the coffee plantations and atap palm processing proved economically ruinous, due to malaria and inclement climate. From 1895 and 1896 several German warships were stationed here for a survey of surrounding waters, during which time a total of 295 men came down with malaria. In 1899 the capital of the New Guinea Company was transferred to Herbertshöhe on the island of New Pomerania (now New Britain).\n\nFollowing World War I, the area was turned over to Australia as part of the League of Nations mandated Territory of New Guinea.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army captured Madang without a fight during World War II in 1942. In September 1943, Australian forces launched a sustained campaign to retake the Finisterre Range and Madang. The town was captured on April 24, 1944, but during the fighting and occupation it was virtually destroyed and had to be rebuilt afterwards.\n\nMadang is viewed by many in the country as being safer and more pleasant for expatriates than the larger cities of Lae and Port Moresby. Because of this, some NGOs have chosen Madang as the location of their main offices in country.\n\nCUSO (a Canadian NGO) and VSO (a British NGO) both have their headquarters in Madang.\n\nSave the Children, WWF, and World Vision are also present with branch offices in Madang.\n\nAs a consequence Madang has a larger number of expatriates working and living in the town than its small population would suggest.\n\nMadang is the home of Divine Word University.\n\nIndustry and farming are growing constantly in importance, especially for export. There are the widespread coconut palm plantations on the coast and cardamum is grown in Madang.\n\nThe Kulili plantation is the second largest of Kar Kar Island's twelve plantations with its more than a thousand coconut palms and cocoa trees. 70% of the cocoa and 50% of the copra produced in Madang province comes from Kar Kar.\n\nIn Madang province 173 regional languages are spoken, some of them being extremely different from the others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1796545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796545", "title": "Timsbury, Hampshire", "text": "Timsbury, Hampshire\n\nTimsbury is a village located in Hampshire, England, near the town of Romsey. It lies mainly along the A3057 road running north from Romsey towards Stockbridge, and shares a boundary with the village of Michelmersh.\n\nIt has a population of approximately 400.\n\nThe name \"Timsbury\" is derived from the Old English \"timber\" + \"byrig\" (dative of \"burh\"), meaning 'timber fort or manor'.\n\nTimsbury has grown from a traditional village centred on the Manor House (now split into many dwellings) and the Church of St Andrew. Although there may have been a Saxon church, the current Grade II listed building dates from around the early 15th century and was badly damaged by fire on 9 March 2014.\n\nHistorically, Edmund Sharp and his wife Alice moved from the county of Berkshire to Timsbury towards the end of the seventeenth century. A direct descendant of Edmund Sharp was Richard Sharp (politician), once hailed as possibly being the most popular man in Georgian London.\n\nAn interesting anecdote has survived concerning one of Edmund's sons, Richard, who, born in 1665 gained a reputation as an accomplished wrestler and ‘cudgeller’ in the area. Even in those days cudgelling was a very old custom and especially popular in the West of England where great pride was attached to skills which were often handed from father to son. It was a fast and furious activity conducted brutally using a short club and the expression ‘to break a head’ was associated with the cudgeller's sport since the victor was he who first drew blood from a gash to the head.\n\nThe story recorded by his grandson and clearly cherished by later generations underlines the extent of Richard's physical prowess,\"While he lived at Romsey he of a summer’s day rode up to\" \"Timsbury, where he lived, where he had been brought up and\" \"where when young he had been so fond of wrestling. It so\" \"happened that a stage was erected and sitting on his horse he\" \"stayed long enough to see a man throw two or three men who had\" \"mounted the stage against him, till all were intimidated from\" \"entering the list; the conqueror …. triumphed on the stage with\" \"so much arrogance that my grandfather was tempted to humble\" \"him; therefore he got off his horse, mounted the stage, threw the\" \"boaster on his back and having humbled the boaster he\" \"immediately took horse and left them.\"In time the Sharp family became well established in the Romsey area and during the 18th and 19th centuries many of them held important positions as merchants or influential citizens of Romsey. A brass floor plate in Romsey Abbey commemorates many of them.\n\nCartoonist Norman Thelwell made his home in the village, in a remodeled farmhouse with a trout pond, described in his 1978 book \"A Plank Bridge by a Pool.\"\n\nIn modern Timsbury, the local amenities include a garden centre with cafe, a pub called \"The Malthouse\", a car sales garage, a fishery, St Andrew's Church of England church, a Jehovah Witness's Kingdom Hall, a recycling site, the Hunts Farm Sports Ground, and a pre-school. The ladies of Timsbury were bequeathed a hall which was used by the Women's Institute (WI), however, following a decline in local WI membership the hall was sold to the village band.\n\nMany local facilities are shared within the civil parish of Michelmersh and Timsbury due to their close proximity, including the Jubilee (village) Hall and the sports pavilion. The villages share a common village design statement to guide development in the area.\n\nThe local telephone exchange is located in nearby Braishfield, with most telephone numbers in the village 01794 368XXX.\n\nThe parish publishes a bi-monthly newsletter distributed free to households in the parish.\n\nAdjacent villages include Awbridge, Kimbridge, Mottisfont, Mottisfont & Dunbridge railway station, Lockerley, Houghton, Hampshire, Horsebridge railway station, Kings Sombourne, Braishfield, Hursley, Ampfield,\n\n"}
