It is based on the 1935 opera \"Porgy and Bess\" by George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward, and Ira Gershwin, which is in turn based on Heyward's 1925 novel \"Porgy\", as well as Heyward's subsequent 1927 non-musical stage adaptation, co-written with his wife Dorothy. The screenplay for the film, which turned the operatic recitatives into spoken dialogue, was very closely based on the opera and was written by N. Richard Nash.\n\nThe project was the last for Samuel Goldwyn. Due to its controversial subject matter, the film was shown only briefly following its initial reserved seat engagements in major cities, where it drew mixed reviews from critics. Two months after its release, Goldwyn grudgingly conceded \"No one is waiting breathlessly for my next picture.\"\n\nThe movie is not available on home video, and it is unknown if a quality print still exists, prompting it to be considered one of the more prestigious and expensively produced \"missing films.\"\n\nIn 2011, the film was chosen for inclusion in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.\n\nSet in the early 1900s in the fictional Catfish Row section of Charleston, South Carolina, which serves as home to a black fishing community, the story focuses on the title characters: crippled beggar Porgy, who travels about in a goat-drawn cart, and the drug-addicted Bess, who lives with stevedore Crown, the local bully. While high on cocaine supplied by Sportin' Life, Crown kills Robbins after the latter vanquishes him in a craps game; Bess urges Crown to flee. Sportin' Life suggests she accompany him to New York City, an offer Bess declines. She seeks refuge with her neighbors, all of whom refuse to help her. Porgy finally agrees to let her stay with him.\n\nBess and Porgy settle into domestic life together and soon fall in love. Just before a church picnic on Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life once again approaches Bess, but Porgy warns him to leave her alone. Bess wishes to stay with Porgy, since he cannot attend the picnic because of his disability, but he urges her to go. After the picnic ends, and before Bess can leave, Crown, who has been hiding in the woods on the island, confronts her. She initially struggles to resist him but Crown rapes her. The others, not knowing exactly what has happened, leave and return to the mainland.\n\nTwo days later, Bess returns to Catfish Row in a state of delirium. When she recovers, she remembers what happened. Feeling that she betrayed Porgy, she begs his forgiveness. She admits she is unable to resist Crown and asks Porgy to protect her from him. Crown eventually returns to claim his woman, and when he draws his knife, Porgy strangles him. He is detained by the police merely to identify the body, but Sportin' Life, who has fed Bess cocaine, convinces her Porgy inadvertently will reveal himself to be the murderer. In her drugged state, she finally accepts his offer to take her to New York. When Porgy returns and discovers she is gone, he sets off to find her.\n\n\nWith Diahann Carroll's death on October 4, 2019, Sidney Poitier is the only living principal cast member.\n\nThe original 1935 Broadway production of \"Porgy and Bess\" closed after only 124 performances. A 1942 revival, stripped of all recitative, fared slightly better, as did a subsequent national tour and another revival in 1953, but in financial terms, the work did not have a very good track record. Still, there were many who thought it had potential as a film. Otto Preminger was one of several producers, including Hal Wallis, Louis B. Mayer, Dore Schary, Anatole Litvak, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and Harry Cohn, who had tried to secure the film rights without success. Cohn even wanted to cast Fred Astaire, Al Jolson, and Rita Hayworth and have them perform in blackface, something to which the Gershwin estate vehemently was opposed. For 25 years, Ira Gershwin had resisted all offers, certain that his brother's work would be \"debased\" by Hollywood. Finally, on May 8, 1957, he sold the rights to Samuel Goldwyn for $600,000 as a down payment against 10% of the film's gross receipts.\n\nWhen Langston Hughes, Goldwyn's first choice for screenwriter, proved to be unavailable, the producer approached Paul Osborn, Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, Sidney Kingsley, Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, Clifford Odets, and Rod Serling, all of whom expressed varying degrees of interest, but cited prior commitments. Goldwyn finally signed N. Richard Nash, who completed a lengthy first draft by December 1957. For director, Goldwyn sought Elia Kazan, Frank Capra, and King Vidor without success. He finally settled on Rouben Mamoulian, who had directed the original Broadway productions of both the play \"Porgy\" and its operatic adaptation.\n\nNash's screenplay changed virtually all of the sung recitative to spoken dialogue, as in the 1942 stage revival. For example, in the original opera, Porgy sings the line \"If there weren't no Crown, Bess, if there was only just you and Porgy, what then?\", upon which Bess launches into the duet \"I Loves You Porgy\". In the film, the line is spoken. The recitatives themselves did not have to really be rewritten, because they do not rhyme, while the words in all the songs do.\n\nBecause of its themes of fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, \"Porgy and Bess\" proved difficult to cast. Many black actors felt the story did nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined it. So many performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles, disregarding their total lack of acting experience. Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, \"Swear on your life you'll never use him.\" The producer, who sneeringly called Davis \"that monkey,\" assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead. When Calloway declined, Davis had Frank Sinatra and some of his associates pressure Goldwyn, who finally announced to Davis, \"The part is yours. Now will you get all these guys off my back?\"\n\nGoldwyn offered Sidney Poitier $75,000 to portray Porgy. The actor had serious reservations about the role and initially turned it down, but his agent led Goldwyn to believe she could persuade her client to star in the film. This proved unsuccessful, and Goldwyn threatened to sue the actor for breaching an oral contract. When Poitier realized his refusal to star in \"Porgy\" might jeopardize his appearance in the Stanley Kramer film \"The Defiant Ones\", he reconsidered and grudgingly accepted, assuring Goldwyn that he would \"do the part to the best of my ability – under the circumstances.\"\n\nMezzo Muriel Smith, co-creator (double-cast with soprano Muriel Rahn) of the Broadway title role in Oscar Hammerstein's \"Carmen Jones\", and creator of the role of Bloody Mary in the original London cast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"South Pacific\", whose more important movie ghost-singing assignments included dubbing for Zsa Zsa Gabor in John Huston's original film version of \"Moulin Rouge\" (1952) and for Juanita Hall in the film version of \"South Pacific\" (1958), turned down Samuel Goldwyn's offer to portray Bess, responding that the work \"Doesn't do right by my people.\" This statement contradicts another that Samuel Goldwyn's first and only choice for Bess was Dorothy Dandridge, who accepted the role without enthusiasm. Her \"Carmen Jones\" co-stars Pearl Bailey, Brock Peters, and Diahann Carroll also accepted roles, but all of them had concerns about how their characters would be portrayed. Bailey warned costume designer Irene Sharaff that she would not wear any bandannas because she was unwilling to look like Aunt Jemima.\n\nCompleting the primary creative team were production designer Oliver Smith, who recently had won the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design for \"My Fair Lady\", and André Previn and Ken Darby, who would supervise the music. Because Poitier could not sing and the score was beyond Dandridge's range, their vocals would be dubbed, and Goldwyn insisted that only black singers could be hired for the task. Leontyne Price, who had portrayed Bess in the 1952 European tour and the acclaimed 1953 Broadway revival, was invited to sing the role on film, but responded, \"No body, no voice.\" Adele Addison and Robert McFerrin eventually were hired, but neither received screen credit.\n\nDespite Goldwyn's intention that the music sound as much like it did in the original opera as possible, he did allow Previn and his team to completely rescore and even change the underscoring heard during the fight scenes and at several other moments, as well as in the overture to the film.\n\nA full-cast dress rehearsal was scheduled for July 3, 1958, but slightly after 4:00 am, a fire destroyed all of the sets and costumes, at a loss of $2 million. Rumors that the blaze had been started by black arsonists determined to shut down production immediately began to circulate. Goldwyn publicly denounced this rumor, although studio insiders were certain that the fire had been set deliberately. The production was placed on hiatus for six weeks to allow for reconstruction. During this period, director Mamoulian repeatedly clashed with the producer about every aspect of the film, leading Goldwyn to fire him. William Wyler was willing to step in if Goldwyn could postpone the project for a few months, but the producer opted to replace Mamoulian with Otto Preminger, who had already started preparing both \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959) and \"Exodus\" (1960), but was willing to set them aside for the opportunity to helm \"Porgy and Bess\". Mamoulian was incensed not only that he had been dismissed after eight months of pre-production work, but that he had been replaced by Preminger, who had taken over \"Laura\" (1944) when Mamoulian had ignored all of Preminger's directives as producer of that film. Claiming Goldwyn had fired him for \"frivolous, spiteful, or dictatorial reasons not pertinent to the director's skill or obligation,\" he brought his case to the Directors Guild of America, which notified all its members, including Preminger, that they could not enter into a contract with Goldwyn. This prompted the Producers Guild of America to become involved. They insisted Goldwyn had the right to change directors and was not in breach of contract because he had paid Mamoulian in full. When Mamoulian changed tactics and attempted to raise charges of racism against Preminger, he lost any support he had managed to gather, and after three weeks, the matter was resolved in favor of Goldwyn. Mamoulian later tried to get his credit on the film, but the Screen Directors Guild voted to give sole credit to Preminger.\n\nThe change of directors was stressful for Dandridge who, according to her manager, had ended an affair with Preminger when she became pregnant and he insisted she have an abortion. According to the director, he had ended his relationship with the actress because he was neither willing to marry her nor deal with her unstable emotions. In any event, Dandridge was unhappy and lacked self-assurance, especially when the director began to criticize her performance.\n\nPreminger objected to the stylized sets and elaborate costumes - \"You've got a two-dollar whore in a two-thousand-dollar dress,\" he admonished Goldwyn. He also wanted Previn to provide orchestrations favoring jazz rather than symphony, but the producer wanted the film to look and sound as much like the original Broadway production he had admired as possible. He grudgingly agreed to allow the director to film the picnic sequence on Venice Island near Stockton, but for the most part, Preminger felt his creative instincts were stifled. Only in the area of actual filming did he exert complete control by shooting as little extra footage as possible so Goldwyn couldn't tamper with the film once it was completed.\n\nPrincipal photography ended on December 16, 1958. Columbia executives were unhappy with the film, particularly its downbeat ending, and one suggested it be changed to allow Porgy to walk. Goldwyn, however, was determined the film should be faithful to its source, going so far as to insist it be described as an \"American folk opera\" rather than a \"musical\" in all advertising.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote the \"most haunting of American musical dramas has been transmitted on the screen in a way that does justice to its values and almost compensates for the long wait...N. Richard Nash has adapted and Otto Preminger has directed a script that fairly bursts with continuous melodrama and the pregnant pressure of human emotions at absolute peaks...Mr. Preminger, with close and taut direction, keeps you keyed up for disaster all the time. To this structure of pictorial color and dramatic vitality, there is added a musical expression that is possibly the best this fine folk opera has ever had. Under André Previn's direction, the score is magnificently played and sung, with some of the most beautiful communication coming from the choral group...To be sure, there are some flaws in this production...But, for the most part, this is a stunning, exciting and moving film, packed with human emotions and cheerful and mournful melodies. It bids fair to be as much a classic on the screen as it is on the stage.\"\n\n\"Time\" observed \"\"Porgy and Bess\" is only a moderate and intermittent success as a musical show; as an attempt to produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure...On the stage the show has an intimate, itch-and-scratch-it folksiness that makes even the dull spots endearing. On the colossal Todd-AO screen, Catfish Row covers a territory that looks almost as big as a football field, and the action often feels about as intimate as a line play seen from the second tier. What the actors are saying or singing comes blaring out of a dozen stereophonic loudspeakers in such volume that the spectator almost continually feels trapped in the middle of a cheering section. The worst thing about Goldwyn's \"Porgy\", though, is its cinematic monotony. The film is not so much a motion picture as a photographed opera...Still, there are some good things about the show. Sammy Davis Jr., looking like an absurd Harlemization of Chico Marx, makes a wonderfully silly stinker out of Sportin' Life. The singing is generally good—particularly the comic bits by Pearl Bailey and the ballads by Adele Addison...And the color photography gains a remarkable lushness through the use of filters, though in time...the spectator may get tired of the sensation that he is watching the picture through amber-colored sunglasses.\"\n\nChannel 4 noted \"That it stands as an entertaining spectacle and the director's best musical is secondary in interest to the Hollywood politics surrounding it.\"\n\nJames Baldwin gave the film a negative review in his essay \"On Catfish Row\": \"Grandiose, foolish, and heavy with the stale perfume of self-congratulation, the Hollywood-Goldwyn-Preminger production of \"Porgy and Bess\" lumbered into the Warner theater...[T]he saddest and most infuriating thing about the Hollywood production of \"Porgy and Bess\" is that Mr. Otto Preminger has a great many gifted people in front of his camera and not the remotest notion of what to do with any of them...This event, like everything else in the movie, is so tastelessly overdone, so heavily telegraphed—rolling chords, dark sky, wind, ominous talk about hurricane bells, etc.—that there is really nothing left for the actors to do.\" Baldwin was also critical of the sincerity of a white man directing black actors: \"In the case of a white director called upon to direct a Negro cast, the supposition ceases—with very rare exceptions—to have any validity at all. The director cannot know anything about his company if he knows nothing about the life that produced them...Black people still do not, by and large, tell white people the truth and white people still do not want to hear it.\n\nThe film opened on a reserved-seat basis at the Warner Theatre in New York City on June 24, 1959, and the Carthay Circle Theater in Los Angeles on July 5. Shortly after opening in Atlanta in early August, the movie's run was cancelled because it angered some black viewers, and although the \"Atlanta Journal\" accused Goldwyn of censoring his own film, he pulled the film from several other areas throughout the U.S. as well.\n\nThe movie was commercially unsuccessful, earning back only half its $7 million cost.\n\nIt was broadcast on network television only once - Sunday night, March 5, 196 on ABC-TV (during a week that also saw a rebroadcast of a TV adaptation of \"Brigadoon\" as well as the first telecast of Hal Holbrook's one-man show \"Mark Twain Tonight!\"). The 1959 \"Porgy and Bess\" has not been seen in its entirety on network TV since, although clips have been shown on some of the American Film Institute specials. The movie had multiple presentations during the 1970s on Los Angeles local television, KTLA-TV, Channel 5, an independent station with access to the Goldwyn Studios output, most likely using the special pan and scan 35mm print which was made for the ABC-TV network presentation, as was KTLA-TV's practice.\n\nGoldwyn's lease of the rights was only 15 years. After they expired, the film could not be shown without the permission of the Gershwin and Heyward estates, and even then only after substantial compensation was paid. Despite repeated requests, the Gershwin estate repeatedly refused to grant permission for the film to be seen.\n\nPrints of the film are \"beyond rare\" and the film has been called \"the holy grail of missing movies.\" Though bootleg copies are available, it is not known if a complete, quality print exists. Michael Strunsky, the trustee and executor of the Ira Gershwin Musical Estate, told \"The Hollywood Reporter\" in 2017 that Ira Gershwin and his wife, Leonore, viewed the film as a \"piece of shit\" and directed Goldwyn to destroy all remaining films 20 years after release, as was their right. However, Michael Feinstein, who was Ira Gershwin's assistant, denies that this ever happened.\n\nA faded 70mm print with faulty 6-track magnetic sound and German subtitles has been discovered and was screened for the opening of the 22. International Film Festival Innsbruck.\n\nIt wasn't until 2007 that it was given a theatrical showing again when, on September 26 and 27, the Ziegfeld Theatre in midtown-Manhattan presented it in its entirety, complete with overture, intermission and exit music, followed by a discussion with Preminger biographer Foster Hirsch.\n\nAndré Previn and Ken Darby won the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. Leon Shamroy was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Color). Irene Sharaff was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design (Color). Gordon E. Sawyer and Fred Hynes were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.\n\nThe movie won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge were nominated in the musical/comedy performance category.\n\nN. Richard Nash was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical.\n\nThe movie's soundtrack album won the Grammy Award for Best Sound Track Album or Recording of Original Cast From a Motion Picture or Television.\n\nEarlier in the 1970s, a stereo 7-1/2 ips reel-to-reel tape of the soundtrack was released.\n\nIn 2011, \"Porgy and Bess\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The Registry noted the film's production history, a period when \"the civil rights movement gained momentum and a number of African-American actors turned down roles they considered demeaning,\" but that, over time, it was \"now considered an 'overlooked masterpiece' by one contemporary scholar\".\n\n\n"}

He gained fame from a number of high-profile takeover bids, in particular his bid to take control of Harrods. He was known for his complex business interests in Africa, his closeness to a number of African leaders, and his rumoured co-operation with MI6 as it pertained to post-colonial British foreign policy in Africa.\n\nRowland was born Roland Walter Fuhrhop on 27 November 1917 during World War I in a British internment camp for aliens outside Calcutta, India. His mother was Anglo-Dutch and his father Wilhelm Fuhrhop was a German export-import trader in Calcutta. Having been born in British India, Roland acquired automatic British citizenship by the custom of \"jus soli\". But his parents remained \"enemy aliens\" for the duration of the First World War, and after the war the Fuhrhops were refused entry into the United Kingdom. They settled in Hamburg, Germany. He was said to have been nicknamed \"Tiny\" by his nanny because of his large size. In the 1930s, he was briefly sucked into the Hitler Youth, though his father was firmly opposed to Hitler, and would move his family to Britain in 1937 to escape Nazi Germany.\n\nRoland was sent to England where he attended Churcher's College in Hampshire, where he acquired an upper-class British accent and mannerisms. His family settled in England in 1937.\n\nRowland then worked for his uncle's shipping business in the City of London. He took his uncle's surname, Rowland, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. He was conscripted into the British Army, where he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps. As enemy aliens, his parents were interned on the Isle of Man, where his mother died. He himself was interned as an enemy alien after trying to arrange for the release of his father.\n\nIn 1948 Tiny Rowland emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, where he subsequently managed a tobacco farm at Eiffel Flats, Mashonaland West province. From 1952 to 1963 he lived with Irene Smith, wife of a business partner.\n\nRowland was recruited to the London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company, later Lonrho, as chief executive in 1962. Under his leadership, the firm expanded beyond mining and became a conglomerate, dealing in newspapers, hotels, distribution, textiles and many other lines of business. During 1973, Rowland's position was the subject of a High Court case in which eight Lonrho directors sought Rowland's dismissal, due to both his temperament and to claims he had concealed financial information from the board. Rowland failed in his legal attempt to block the move but was subsequently backed by shareholders and retained his position. \nBritish Prime Minister, Edward Heath, referring to the case, criticised the company in the House of Commons and described events there as \"the unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism\".\n\nIn 1983, Rowland took over \"The Observer\" newspaper and became its chairman. He also campaigned to gain control of Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, but was defeated by Egyptian-born Mohamed Al-Fayed.\n\nA December 1993 \"Financial Times\" article revealed that Hemar Enterprises, makers of documentary film \"The Maltese Double Cross – Lockerbie\" was owned by Metropole Hotels, controlled by Rowland. The film stated that Libya had no responsibility for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Shortly after the indictment of Libya in the Pan Am Flight 103 incident, Rowland had sold a percentage of his interests to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico), controlled by the Government of Libya. For this reason, Susan and Daniel Cohen, parents of Pan Am Flight 103 victim Theodora Cohen, claimed that Libya had backed the film.\n\nIn a boardroom coup engineered by the German tycoon Dieter Bock in October 1993, Rowland was forced to step down as Chairman of Lonrho. He was succeeded by former diplomat Sir John Leahy. In March 1995 he was dismissed by the Board. The Cohens conjecture that Rowland's association with Muammar al-Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, and the film The Maltese Double Cross - Lockerbie contributed to the decision to dismiss Rowland.\n\nIn 1996 President Nelson Mandela awarded Rowland the Order of Good Hope, the highest South African honour.\nRowland died from cancer in London on 25 July 1998.\n\nRowland is prominently featured in the second part of the documentary \"The Mayfair Set\" by Adam Curtis, where he is profiled as a ruthless businessman, jetting through Africa to take over British companies in former colonies.\n\nHe was also said to have served as the model for the ruthless British businessman \"Sir Edward Matheson\" played by Stewart Granger in the 1978 film \"The Wild Geese\".\n\nThe satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" frequently referred to him as \"tiny but perfect\", not because of any shortness in stature, but because he was always impeccably groomed.\n\nIn Australia, a champion racehorse, Lonhro, was named after him (with an intentional misspelling). As a foal, the horse was described as \"tiny but perfect\".\n\nIn South Africa, Rustenburg, Marikana a shaft and concentrator plant was named after him; getting the name Rowland Concentrator and Rowland Shaft. Both of these operations are owned by Lonmin Platinum Mine.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a staple of Doug Henning's stage and television shows.\n\nA large transparent bowl is placed on a pedestal along with three small piles of colored sand. The bowl is filled with water, often with the magician drinking some or providing it to an audience member to demonstrate it is simply normal water. Stirring the water with his hand, the water turns murky or black. The colored sands are then poured into the bowl and stirred by hand. With a flourish, the magician reaches into the bowl to pull out each color of sand, separate and unmixed. With a last stir, the water turns clear again, with a few stray grains of sand left in it.\n\nThe trick uses simple chemistry for all of its effects.\n\nThe change of color from clear to opaque and back can be accomplished using any number of simple chemical reactions. Almost any acid/base invisible ink formula will work, with common examples being iodine which goes clear with sodium metabisulfite, or a mixture of tannic acid and ferric ammonium sulfate which turns clear with oxalic acid. In both cases, the chemicals are introduced during the pour, often using multiple containers with only the first being pure water, or using any number of simple gadgets like a false thumb to store them during setup.\n\nThe sand is treated with a hydrophobic compound to produce what is commonly known as magic sand or Moon Sand. When poured into water, it naturally clings to other grains, forming piles or lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The sand can be poured rapidly in a spray and will still re-form, adding to the illusion of it mixing into the water. The hand-stirring performed after pouring will leave these piles intact. The magician can then reach into the bowl and feel out the piles, grasping some of the sand and tossing it into the air. Water has been excluded from the piles, leaving the sand completely dry and free-flowing.\n"}

Of the three games, only \"Sun\" was released in North America on December 4, 2000 by Atlus, while their original Japan releases were by Hudson Soft. The games focus on a boy named Cody (his default name) and his adventures on his island with his robotic friends. They mostly resemble the \"Pokémon\" series of video games, but also bear similarities to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Robotrek\", published by Enix (now Square Enix).\n\nWithin \"Robopon\" Sun, Star, and Moon versions, the player assumes the role of a child named Cody, whose grandpa is retiring and gives him the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company. Cody travels around Porombo Island collecting Robopon and battling against the \"Legend 7\", the top-ranked Robopon collectors on the island. Each time Cody successfully beats one of the Legend 7, he takes his or her place in the ranking system. \n\nGameplay revolves around collecting, software upgrading, equipment swapping, and battling robotic characters in a similar manner to the \"Pokémon\" game series. To power up the Robopon, the player could add software and parts to them. Parts had varying amounts of space to store software and determined what sort of attacks the Robopon could use. For example, a Robopon could have an \"Armgun\" or a \"Punch\" part, and this software adds certain elements to the attacks. Furthermore, software could be added onto other parts, creating more powerful additions. For example, by equipping a \"Thunder\" software to a \"Punch\" part, the Robopon would be able to use \"Thunderpunch\". Software could also be mixed together to create special attacks - by mixing \"Fire\" and \"Thunder\" software, the Robopon would have the special move \"Zapp!!\". This software could also be removed. If you did so, the attack abilities it gave the Robopon would be removed as well. Because only Sun was released in the US, not all of the original 153 Robopon were available because the others were located on the \"Star Version\" that was never produced in the \"US\".\n\n\"Robopon\" cartridges have an Infrared panel on their top edge that allows them to trade information using waves much like a TV or VCR remote, allowing the cartridge to react to different objects. For example, pointing a remote control at the cartridges and pressing a button might boost the \"Robopon\"'s stats, or open a chest within the games. This feature was called the \"GB Kiss\". The game included over 150 different Robopon to use, with the first 2 releases and then over 168, with the release of Moon version, though some had to be upgraded, similar to \"Pokémon's\" evolution stages. The Robopon were classified as either Arm, Move, or Boot. Arm tended to have high offense, Move were fast, and Boot had the highest stats overall. Boot Robopon could not have their parts or software changed.\n\nWhile the USA only received the Sun Version, the Japanese first had the two main releases, then nearly a year later got the \"Moon Version\", release. The Japanese version of the GB Kiss features a letter writing/sending feature, that can be accessed from the main menu, which can also send messages over the telephone. While for the USA release, only the sending Robopon feature is included on the GB Kiss. These versions are also compatible with the Japanese exclusive game \"Robot Ponkottsu 64: Nanatsu no Umi no Caramel\" with the Nintendo 64's Transfer Pak Yet another version, Robot Ponkottsu: Comic Bom Bom Special Version, was released in Japan on December 24, 1999. \n\nTwo Game Boy Advance sequels were made; \"Robopon 2 Cross Version\" and \"Robopon 2 Ring Version\", in a manner similar to that of the release patterns of different generations of \"Pokémon\" games. These games stars Cody traveling to another island but forgetting his Robopon. Subsequently, he has to find new Robopon, but instead of catching them he has to make them by finding different types of batteries and combining them in a method known as \"Sparking\". The game featured four-on-four battles, where all the Robopon the player had on him would battle against four opponent Robopon.\n\nA \"Robopon\" game called \"\" was made for the Nintendo 64 but was never released outside Japan.\n\nThere were three manga series \"Robot Ponkots\" (ロボットポンコッツ), \"Robot Ponkots 2\" (ロボットポンコッツ2), and \"Robot Ponkots Go!\" (ロボットポンコッツ豪!) created by Wataru Tamori which were all serialized in Comic Bom Bom from the late 1990s to early 2000s.

Males have a wingspan of , and have an iridescent purple-blue sheen that the slightly larger (80–92 mm) females lack. The larvae (caterpillars) are green with white and yellow markings, and have two large \"horns\" at the anterior end and a smaller one at the posterior.\n\nFemales spend most of their lives in the tree canopy, favouring dense and mature oak woodlands, coming down only to lay their eggs in the small sallow bushes that grow in clearings and rides. Males also spend much of their time in the tree tops, defending their territory from rivals, though they will sometimes descend to drink from puddles or feed. Unlike most butterflies, the purple emperor does not feed from flowers but instead on the honeydew secreted by aphids, sap oozing from oak trees, and on dung, urine and animal carcasses.\n\nRichard South noted that collectors once used animal carcasses \"in a somewhat advanced state of decay\" to lure the males down to the ground, adding that this practice was \"unsportsmanlike\"; otherwise one needed a \"high net\" mounted on a pole about 14 or 15 feet (about 4.5 metres) in length to capture them. Heslop \"et al\". noted that the males' penchant for roadkill can often cause them to be killed by cars.\n\nThey lay eggs in late summer on the upperside of sallow leaves, preferring the broad-leaved sallow, \"Salix caprea\", but they will also use the narrow-leaved sallow, \"Salix atrocinerea\", and various species of poplar. (Poplar is a more common food plant in continental Europe than in the British Isles.) After hatching, the larvae will lie along the midrib of the leaf where they are well camouflaged, and feed only at night. During the winter they hibernate in the forks of sallow branches, where they change colour from green to brown to match their surroundings. (The larvae are variously stated to be reach 35–40 mm long when fully fed or 55–56 mm; it is hard to give definitive measurements, given that they lack a rigid structure.) The following June they form a pale green chrysalis, 30–35 mm long and 12–15 mm in width, resembling a leaf shoot. The adults usually emerge in July, flying well into August.\n\n\"Apatura iris\" is widely distributed in dense, broadleaved woodlands throughout Europe including southern Britain, and across the Palearctic to central and western China. Different subspecies are found across the region (see below).\n\nIn Victorian times this species was regarded as being common in southern England, as far north as the river Humber, but since then it has experienced a sharp decline in both range and numbers. This decline started in the first part of the twentieth century (it was noted by South, for example, writing in 1921) and by the 1960s it was relatively scarce, being confined to old broadleaved woodlands in a few counties in south-east England. Heslop \"et al\". ascribed the decline to habitat fragmentation and loss, starting before the First World War but accelerated by the increased demand for timber during that war, causing old woodlands to be clear felled to make way for commercial forestry crops, especially softwoods. This rendered large parts of its former habitat unsuitable, and it died out in those areas. This process continued after the Second World War for the same reason. Heslop estimated from his personal observation that \"the minimum number of individual imagines (adults) required to sustain a viable colony in an average year is one thousand\"; independent confirmation of this has not been found.\n\nSouth believed that once they had become uncommon, increased collecting had contributed \"to the monarch's destruction\" in many areas. By 1989 the species had a stronghold in the remaining large broadleaved woodlands of Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex, but was still found in scattered localities elsewhere across southern England.\n\nSouth noted that it had not been recorded from Scotland, and only doubtfully from Ireland, adding that \"in Wales it is only found in Monmouthshire.\"\n\n"}

The three stations share studios on Mariposa Street in San Francisco's Mission District and transmitter facilities atop Sutro Tower; until January 17, 2018, KQEH's transmitter was located atop Monument Peak. On cable, the station is available on channel 10 on most providers in the market.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on October 19, 1964, as KTEH. In the late 1990s, KTEH bought KCAH in Watsonville, which was founded in 1989 to serve as the PBS station for the Monterey/Salinas/Santa Cruz market. Before being acquired by KQED, KTEH maintained a Technical Volunteer program, which allowed volunteers to learn how to operate cameras, audio, shading, directing and other production and technical responsibilities, while minimizing its costs. These volunteers made up the technical crews for all of their pledge drives and auction programming, as well as other occasional live broadcasts.\n\nIn 2006, KQED and the KTEH Foundation agreed to merge to form Northern California Public Broadcasting, a name that was changed back to KQED, Inc. in 2011. As a result of the merger, KCAH changed its call letters to KQET on August 12, 2007. Subsequently, on October 1, 2007, KQET, which became a satellite of KTEH following its acquisition of the station, switched programming sources from KTEH to KQED. KQEH's programming is carried on the second digital subchannel of KQET.\nIn December 2010, the Board of Directors of Northern California Public Broadcasting changed the organization's name to KQED Inc. The station changed its call letters to KQEH and rebranded as \"KQED Plus\" on July 1, 2011, after research found that most viewers were unaware that KTEH was related to KQED; other aspects of the station's operation, including programming and staff, were not affected by this change.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKQEH (as KTEH) shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 54, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.

He was released September 14, 2009, by the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 2011, he joined the White Sox coaching staff and became the manager of their Appalachian League (rookie league) affiliate in Bristol. In 2013, he moved up to the Pioneer League with the affiliate in Great Falls, Montana. After one season, he advanced to the lower-A South Atlantic League team in Kannapolis, North Carolina.\n\nRose was often shown on national television during his childhood years as a batboy for his father's teams. When his father joined the Phillies in 1979, Rose Jr. spent time with Aaron Boone, Bret Boone, Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw in the Phillies clubhouse. He appeared on a 1982 Fleer baseball card (#640) titled \"Pete & Re-Pete; Pete Rose & son\" with his father; he was twelve at the time. As a teenager, on September 11, 1985, he made an emotional on-field appearance live on ESPN to celebrate with his father after Rose Sr. broke Ty Cobb's record for most career hits.\n\nIn his youth, Rose played baseball for Bridgetown, a suburb of Cincinnati.

Later that year, Rose was called up to the Cincinnati Reds for his first and only time in the major leagues. He hit only .143 in just 11 games for the Reds, but was widely shown on popular sports highlight shows when he copied his dad's famous crouching batting stance during the first pitch of his first Major League at-bat.

Rydzyna is commonly referred to as \"the pearl of the Polish baroque\".\n\nRydzyna is situated in the southern part of the Wielkopolska Province, 10 km south of Leszno, in the Leszno county (powiat), close to the main Poznań - Wrocław highway E5.\nThe town's population is 2446 (2006). \nThe population of the overall Rydzyna community is 8200.\n\nIt was founded at the beginning of the 15th century by Jan from Czernina, a descendant of the Wierzbno family, a knight of king Władysław II Jagiełło. At the end of the 17th century the town and its environs were owned by well-known magnates, the Leszczyński and then the Sułkowski families, whose investment in the town resulted in its current nickname as \"the pearl of the Polish baroque\".\n\nThe most historically important site in Rydzyna is Rydzyna Castle, formerly the residence of king Stanisław I and the Sułkowski princes. The castle in Rydzyna was built at the beginning of 15th century by Jan of Czernina. At the end of the 17th century, Italian architects Joseph Simon Bellotti and Pompeo Ferrari erected the present Baroque castle on its ancient foundations. The first owners of the castle were the Leszczyński family. Together with its park and surrounding areas, it was one of the most splendid palaces in Poland. Between 1704 and 1709 it was a residence of the Polish king Stanisław I. In 1709, during the Great Northern War, the castle was partly burnt by the tsar's soldiers. However wall-paintings and stucco works in representative rooms, made by the best Italian artists, were not destroyed completely, and the castle was restored and expanded by Prince August Sułkowski, who purchased the Leszczyński estates in 1738. The castle, together with its adjacent park and the surrounding terrain, forms one of the most valuable castle-park complexes in Poland.\n\nOther historical monuments within the town boundaries are baroque tenement houses around the market square together with the town hall and the baroque parish church, all built in the 18th century and designed by the same architects as the castle. The evangelical church building now serves as a concert hall. In the center of the market square a unique statue representing the Trinity was erected in 1761 by the sculptor Andrew Schmidt in memory of the plague that decimated the town in 1709. The monumental former annexes to the castle, facing its north side, are in Classic style. All the monuments are the works of prominent architects brought in from all over Europe by the Leszczyński and Sułkowski families. \n\nAt one time there were over 40 windmills around Rydzyna, Today only one remains, renovated in 2003 it now houses the Museum of Agriculture and Milling.\n\n\n"}

He did not return to Barbados for eleven years. In the absence of his father, Weekes and his sister were raised by his mother Lenore and an aunt, whom Weekes credits with his successful upbringing. Weekes attended St Leonard's Boys' School, where he later bragged that he never passed an exam (although he would later successfully study Hotel Management) and preferred to concentrate on sport. In addition to cricket, Weekes was also a keen football player, representing Barbados. As a boy Weekes assisted the groundsmen at Kensington Oval and often acted as a substitute fielder in exchange for free entry to the cricket, giving himself the opportunity to watch leading international cricketers at close range. At age 13 Weekes began playing for Westshire Cricket Club in the Barbados Cricket League (BCL). He would have preferred to have played for his local club, Pickwick, but the club only catered to white players.\n\nWeekes left school in 1939, aged 14, and, not having a job, spent his days playing cricket and football. He later attributed much of his cricketing success to this time spent practising. In 1943 Weekes enlisted in the Barbados Regiment and served as a Lance-Corporal until his discharge in 1947 and while he never saw active service, the fact he was in the military meant he was eligible to play cricket for Garrison Sports Club in the higher standard Barbados Cricket Association in addition to Westshire in the BCL.\n\nWeekes's performances in Barbados club cricket led to his selection in a 1945 trial match to select a first-class side to represent Barbados on a Goodwill tour of Trinidad and Tobago. Weekes scored 88 and 117 retired and was selected for the tour, making his first-class debut on 24 February 1945, aged 19 years, 364 days, for Barbados against Trinidad and Tobago at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain. Batting at number six, he scored 0 and eight as Barbados lost by ten wickets.\n\nWeekes scored his maiden first-class half century in his next match, making 53 as an opener against Trinidad in March 1945 (where he also bowled for the first time in a first class match, conceding 15 runs in four wicketless overs). In his first two first-class seasons Weekes was only a moderate success with the bat, averaging 16.62 by the end of the 1945/46 season but began to find form in 1946/47, when, batting at number four, his maiden first-class century, 126 against British Guiana at Bourda, Georgetown, and averaged 67.57 for the season. The 1947/48 season included a tour by MCC and Weekes impressed West Indian selectors with an unbeaten 118 against the tourists prior to the first Test in Bridgetown.\n\nWeekes was one of the \"Three Ws\", along with Clyde Walcott and Frank Worrell, noted as outstanding batsmen from Barbados who all made their Test debut in 1948 against England. The three were all born within seventeen months of each other and within a mile of Kensington Oval in Barbados and Walcott believed that the same midwife delivered each of them. Weekes first met Walcott in 1941, aged 16, when they were team mates in a trial match. They shared a room together when on tour and, along with Worrell, would go dancing together on Saturday nights after playing cricket.\n\nThe name \"Three Ws\" was coined by an English journalist during the 1950 West Indian tour of England. Walcott believed that Weekes was the best all-round batsman of the three, while Worrell was the best all-rounder and modestly referred to himself as the best wicket keeper of the trio. After their retirement from cricket, the three remained close and, following the death of Worrell in 1967, Weekes acted as one of the pallbearers at his funeral. The 3Ws Oval, situated on the Cave Hill campus of the University of the West Indies was named in their honour, and a monument to the three Ws is opposite the oval. Worrell and Walcott are buried on ground overlooking the oval but there has been no official word from Weekes whether he intends to be buried with them upon his death.\n\nWeekes made his Test debut for the West Indies against England at Kensington Oval on 21 January 1948, aged 22 years and 329 days. He was one of 12 debutants; seven from the West Indies (the other were Walcott, Robert Christiani, Wilfred Ferguson, Berkeley Gaskin, John Goddard and Prior Jones) and five for England; Jim Laker, Maurice Tremlett, Dennis Brookes, Winston Place and Gerald Smithson. Batting at number three, Weekes made 35 and 25 as the match ended in a draw.\n\nWeekes's performance in his next two Tests, in the words of \"Wisden\", \"did little to indicate the remarkable feats which lay ahead\" and was initially dropped from the Fourth and final Test of the series against England before an injury to George Headley allowed Weekes to return to the side. After being dropped on 0, Weekes scored 141, his maiden Test century and was subsequently chosen for the West Indies tour of India, Pakistan and Ceylon.\n\nIn his next Test, the First against India, at Delhi, in November 1948 (the first by West Indies in India), Weekes scored 128, followed by 194 in the Second Test in Bombay and 162 and 101 in the Third Test in Calcutta. Weekes then made 90 in the Fourth Test in Madras, being controversially run out and 56 and 48 in the Fifth Test at Bombay. Weekes's five Test centuries in consecutive innings is a Test record, passing the record previously held by Jack Fingleton and Alan Melville as was his achievement of seven Test half centuries in consecutive innings, passing the record previously jointly held by Jack Ryder, Patsy Hendren, George Headley and Melville. (Andy Flower and Shivnarine Chanderpaul have since equalled Weekes' record of seven half centuries).\n\nBy the end of the series, which also included a century against Ceylon, at that time a non-Test cricketing nation, and a half century against Pakistan in a match not classed as a Test match, Weekes had a Test batting average of 82.46 and had passed 1,000 Test runs in his twelfth innings, one fewer than Donald Bradman. Early in the tour the West Indian team's cricket kit disappeared and Weekes was surprised to see Indian fisherman wearing flannels and West Indian cricket jumpers. As a result of his series, Weekes was named one of the 1949 Indian Cricket \"Cricketers of the Year\". The next season saw no Test cricket played by West Indies but Weekes scored 236* against British Guiana at Bridgetown, averaged 219.50 for the season and raised his career first-class average to 72.64.\n\nIn 1950 West Indies toured England and Weekes continued his excellent form, scoring 338 runs at 56.33 and playing a significant part in the West Indies 3–1 victory in the Test series, as well as 2310 first-class runs at 79.65 (including five double centuries, a record for a West Indian tour of England). By the end of the series, Weekes had scored 1,410 Test runs at 74.21 and had enhanced his reputation as one of the finest slip fielders in world cricket, taking 11 catches in the series. Additionally, his 304* against University of Cambridge remains the only triple century by a West Indian on tour in England. In recognition of his performance, Weekes was named a 1951 Wisden Cricketer of the Year.\n\nNamed as a member of the West Indian team to tour Australia in 1951/52, Weekes was troubled by a range of injuries throughout the tour, including an ongoing thigh injury and a badly bruised right thumb when a door slammed shut on it while he was helping an injured Walcott out of his room, subsequently leaving his performances below expectations.\n\nAdditionally, as the leading West Indian batsman, Weekes was targeted by the Australian fast bowlers, in particular Ray Lindwall, subjecting him to Bodyline-like tactics of sustained short pitched bowling. Reviewing the series, the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" claimed that the Australian tactics to contain Weekes may have been just within the laws of cricket but infringed on the spirit of the game. Leading cricket commentator Alan McGilvray later wrote \"I remain convinced to this day the bumpers hurled at Weekes had a definite influence on charging up West Indian competitiveness in future series.\" Following the Australian tour, the West Indies visited New Zealand. In a tour match against Wellington, Weekes kept wicket in the absence of the injured Simpson Guillen and effected the only stumping of his first class career.\n\nDuring the Port of Spain Test against India in February 1953, Weekes surpassed George Headley's record of 2190 as West Indies' highest Test run scorer. Weekes would hold this record until June 1966 when surpassed by Gary Sobers.\n\nWeekes took his sole Test wicket in this series. In the First Test at Sabina Park, Kingston, with Australia requiring just 20 runs in their second innings to win the Test, Weekes opened the bowling and had Arthur Morris caught by Glendon Gibbs. The Australians were surprised at the level of racism evident throughout the West Indies at the time, and were embarrassed to find that Weekes, Worrall and Walcott had not been invited to a cocktail party at the home of a white West Indian player.\n\nOther achievements include three centuries in consecutive innings against New Zealand in 1956, and a partnership of 338 with Worrell against England in 1954, still a West Indian record for the third wicket. In 1954 Weekes was chosen as the first tenured black captain of Barbados and the second black captain overall following Herman Griffith's temporary captaincy in 1941.\n\nWeekes was affected by sinusitis throughout the tour, requiring five operations, and broke a finger in late June. Reporting on the final day of the 1957 Lord's Test where Weekes had made a rearguard 90 as the West Indies slumped to an innings defeat, \"The Times\"'s cricket correspondent wrote \"It had been a day to quicken one's feeling for cricket, glowing with freshness and impulse and friendliness, and it had belong to Weekes.\" Denis Compton said of Weekes following this innings; \"In every respect, it was the innings of a genius.\" During the tour Weekes became only the fourth West Indian to pass 10,000 first-class runs. Weekes was the first West Indian to pass 3,000 Test runs, in 31 Test matches, and the first to score 4,000 Test runs, in 42 Tests.\n\nIn 1949 Weekes accepted an offer of £500 to play as the professional for Bacup in the Lancashire League. When he first arrived in Bacup, Weekes was greatly affected by the cold and took to wearing an army great coat everywhere, to the extent it became part of his League image. His homesickness for Barbados was tempered by his landlady's potato pies and the presence of Worrell and Walcott, who were playing for League clubs Radcliffe and Enfield respectively. The three Ws would regularly meet at Weekes's house midweek for an evening of piano playing and jazz singing.\n\nIn all, Weekes played seven seasons in the Lancashire League between 1949 and 1958, passing 1000 runs in each. His 1,518 runs scored in 1951 is still the club record and for 40 years was the League record, until broken by Peter Sleep. Weekes scored a total of 9,069 runs for Bacup at 91.61, with 25 centuries, including 195* against Enfield, a score that remains a League record, as does his 1954 batting average of 158.25. Weekes also had success with the ball, taking at least fifty wickets in all but one season at Bacup, including 80 wickets in 1956.\n\nDuring the 1954 season he also played for neighbouring Central Lancashire League club Walsden as sub professional in the Wood Cup Final. His 150 runs and 9 wickets helped the village club to their first trophy in the seventy years since they became founder members of the CLL. Weekes's performances were a significant contribution to League crowds, with over 325,000 spectators attending Lancashire League matches in 1949, a record as yet unsurpassed. He also played up for the crowds; batting in a match against Rawtenstall Cricket Club, Weekes waited until a ball had passed him before taking his left hand off his bat and hitting the ball around his back through square leg for four.\n\nWeekes had a classic batting style, possessed a variety of shots on both sides of the wicket, and is considered one of the hardest hitters in cricket history. Described by \"The Times\" as lightly bow-legged, with a wonderful eye, wrists the envy of any batsman, and feet always the right place to play a shot, Richie Benaud stated that many Australians who saw Weekes in action said he was the closest batsman in style to the pre-World War II Donald Bradman. He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to come down the pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled \"Aspects of Fielding\".\n\nWeekes retired from Test cricket in 1958 due to a persistent thigh injury but continued in first-class cricket until 1964, his final first-class match being against Trinidad and Tobago in Port-of-Spain, scoring 19 and 13. Weekes passed 12,000 first-class runs in his final innings, becoming only the third West Indian, after Worrell and Roy Marshall, to do so.\n\nPost-retirement, Weekes would make occasional appearances in charity and exhibition matches, including for the International Cavaliers. In one 1967 match, aged 42, Weekes, out of practice and in borrowed gear, dominated a bowling attack half his age. Weekes also participated in a Cavaliers tour of Rhodesia in the early 1960s, where he was the focus of racial discrimination, including having a match against a Bulawayo side moved to a substandard ground in a black area due to a local bylaw banning blacks from playing in a white area. Feeling humiliated, Weekes and fellow West Indian Rohan Kanhai threatened to abandon the tour but remained following an apology from Rhodesian government officials.\n\nWhile Weekes was never coached as a young player, he was appointed a Barbados Government Sports Officer in 1958 and found great success as a coach, encouraging young players to obey their instincts and develop their own style. Such was his success, Weekes was appointed coach of the Canadian side at the 1979 Cricket World Cup. Additionally, Weekes served on the executive of the Barbados Cricket Association for many years and helped develop many leading Barbadian players, including Conrad Hunte and Seymour Nurse, both deeply influenced by Weekes. Weekes also found time to work as a television and radio cricket commentator, known for his acerbic wit and deep knowledge of the game and began to play Dominoes and Bridge competitively, representing Barbados in regional Bridge championships. \"The New York Times\" referred to his style as \"aggressive\".\n\nIn 1994 Weekes was appointed as an International Cricket Council match referee, refereeing in four Tests and three One Day Internationals. Weekes published his memoirs \"Mastering the Craft: Ten years of Weekes, 1948 to 1958\" in December 2007, when it was announced that the book will be included in the curriculum of the Caribbean Civilisation Foundation course at the University of the West Indies. Outside of cricket, Weekes became a Justice of the Peace and served on a number of Barbados Government bodies, including the Police Service Commission. Weekes' cousin Kenneth Weekes and son David Murray also played Test cricket for the West Indies, while his grandson Ricky Hoyte played first-class cricket for Barbados and his nephew Donald Weekes played one first-class match for Sussex.\n\nIn June 2019, Weekes was placed in intensive care, after suffering a heart attack in Barbados.\n\nFollowing the end of his cricketing career, Weekes received a range of distinctions, including being made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), the Barbados Gold Crown of Merit (GCM) and in 1995 Weekes was made a Knight of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for his services to cricket. For the 2000 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", Weekes was asked to be a member of the 100 strong electorate to select the Five Cricketers of the 20th Century. All voters were allowed to nominate five players and while there was no disclosure of which five each voter chose, \"Wisden\" editor Matthew Engel revealed that Weekes voted for Dennis Lillee and, as Sir Donald Bradman received 100 votes, it is obvious Weekes voted for Bradman as well.\n\nThe former Prime Minister of Barbados Owen Arthur paid tribute to Weekes for his role in bringing social change to Barbados and the Caribbean, stating \"Through his excellence on the cricket field, Sir Everton helped in a fundamental way to change Barbados for the better, forever, by proving that true excellence cannot be constrained by social barriers.\" In addition the 3Ws Oval, Weekes has been honoured throughout Barbados, including having a roundabout in Warrens, St. Michael named after him. In January 2009 Weekes was one of 55 players inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame and will choose new inductees to the Hall of Fame.\n\nWeekes had a Test batting average of nearly 97.92 in innings immediately after those in which he scored a hundred, the second highest (after Vijay Hazare) for those who had scored five Test centuries. As of February 2009, Weekes' career Test batting average of 58.61 is the eighth highest of all players with 30 or more innings. An oddity of his career was the first innings bias averaging 71.44 compared with 36.64 in the second, and only one of his fifteen tons came in the second innings.\n\n\n"}

It was also shown on the now defunct British cable and satellite station Ftn.\n\nShortly after the end of \"Scream Team\", he was approached to join Living TV's flagship show \"Most Haunted\" (working alongside Yvette Fielding and Karl Beattie) in the role of paranormal investigator, and proved popular with fans in seasons 2 to 4 when he left the show to concentrate on other areas of the media.\n\nMay 2007 saw the launch of his first book \"Phil Whyman's Dead Haunted: Paranormal Encounters & Investigations\". In this book he introduces the reader to the different forms of paranormal activity that can be encouraged at a haunted site and provides a guide to conducting a paranormal investigation. The book covers everything from experiments to his own reports from investigations.\n\nHe is currently working on two fiction books, has a regular column in Chat It's Fate. In September 2010 he married fiancee Sara Woodward at a ceremony held at Comlongon Castle, Scotland.\n\nFrom the East Midlands city of Nottingham, he is a keen musician, composing and performing synth-instrumental music.

{"id": "2214723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214723", "title": "Remington Model 788", "text": "Remington Model 788\n\nThe Remington 788 is a bolt-action, centerfire rifle that was made by Remington Arms from 1967 to 1983. It was marketed as an inexpensive yet accurate hunting rifle to compete with other gun companies' less expensive rifles alongside their more expensive Model 700 line. The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 3 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed. A target version of the .22 caliber 58x series, the 540X, was used by the US military as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n\nThe Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The bolt pictured is a pre-1975 locking model from a .308 Winchester caliber rifle. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the \"fire\" or \"off\" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged. The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt-action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well. When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength. These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter. A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.\n\nA left-handed version was produced in .308 and 6mm Remington calibers. The Carbine version with an barrel was produced in .308 Winchester, 7mm-08, and .243. The stock was revised in 1980 being the only significant change throughout the production history. The following table presents a breakdown of this rifle's 15 year production run by caliber, year, and configuration.\n"}

She was a great-granddaughter of the reformist 7th Earl of Shaftesbury through his younger son, The Hon. Evelyn Melbourne Ashley (1836–1907) and his wife, Sybella Farquhar (d. 1886), a granddaughter of the 6th Duke of Beaufort. From this cadet branch, the Ashley-Cooper peers would inherit the estates of Broadlands (Hampshire, England) and Classiebawn Castle (County Sligo, Ireland).\n\nAshley's mother was Amalia Mary Maud Cassel (1881–1911), daughter of the international magnate Sir Ernest Joseph Cassel, friend and private financier to the future King Edward VII. Cassel was one of the richest and most powerful men in Europe. He lost his beloved wife (Annette Mary Maud Maxwell), for whom he had converted from Judaism to Catholicism. He also lost his only child, Amalia. He left the bulk of his vast fortune to Edwina, his elder granddaughter.\n\nAfter Ashley's father's remarriage in 1914 to Molly Forbes-Sempill (ex-wife of Rear-Admiral Arthur Forbes-Sempill), she was sent away to boarding schools, first to the Links in Eastbourne, then to Alde House in Suffolk, at neither of which was she a willing pupil. Her grandfather, Sir Ernest, solved the domestic dilemma by inviting her to live with him and, eventually, to act as hostess at his London residence, Brook House. Later, his other mansions, Moulton Paddocks and Branksome Dene, would become part of her Cassel inheritance.\n\nBy the time Lord Louis Mountbatten first met Edwina in 1920, she was a leading member of London society. Her maternal grandfather died in 1921, leaving her £2 million (equivalent to £ million in ), and his palatial London townhouse, Brook House, at a time when her future husband's naval salary was £610 a year (equivalent to £ in ). Later, she would inherit the country seat of Broadlands, Hampshire, from her father, Wilfred William Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple.\n\nShe and Mountbatten married on 18 July 1922 at St Margaret's, Westminster. The wedding attracted crowds of more than 8,000 people, and was attended by many members of the royal family, including Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII), and dubbed \"wedding of the year\".\nDrew Pearson described Edwina in 1944 as \"one of the most beautiful women in England\". She was known to have affairs throughout the marriage, doing little to hide them from her husband. He became aware of her lovers, accepted them and even developed friendships with some of them – making them \"part of the family\". Her daughter Pamela Hicks wrote a memoir in which she describes her mother as \"a man eater\" and her mother's many lovers as a succession of \"uncles\" throughout her childhood. Edwina's affair with Jawaharlal Nehru, prime minister of India, both during and after their post-war service has been widely documented.\n\nThe Mountbattens had two daughters, Patricia (14 February 1924 – 13 June 2017) and Pamela (born 19 April 1929). In her memoir daughter Pamela describes Edwina as a detached, rarely seen mother who preferred travelling the world with her current lover to mothering her children.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Lady Mountbatten acquired a new purpose in life and devoted her considerable intelligence and energy to the service of others. In 1941, Mountbatten visited the United States, where she thanked efforts to raise funds for the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance Brigade. In 1942, she was appointed Superintendent-in-Chief of the St John Ambulance Brigade serving extensively with Brigade. In 1945, she assisted in the repatriation of prisoners of war in the South East Asia. She was awarded a CBE in 1943 and made a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) in 1946. She also received the American Red Cross Medal.\n\nLady Mountbatten was the last Vicereine of India, serving during the final months of the British Raj and the first months of the post-Partition period (February 1947 to June 1948) when Louis Mountbatten was the last Viceroy of India and then, after the partition of India and Pakistan in June 1947, the Governor-General of India but not of Pakistan. It was at this time that a serious relationship between Edwina and Nehru began. Lady Mountbatten and the new Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru became infatuated with each other. Whether the romance was ever consummated is not known, however their mutual fondness was evident and caused widespread speculation. In 2012 Edwina's Daughter Lady Pamela Hicks accepted that there was a romance between her mother and Jawaharlal Nehru; which she mentioned in the book \"Daughter Of Empire: Life As A Mountbatten\". British historian Philip Ziegler, with access to the private letters and diaries, concludes the relationship:\n\nFollowing the violent disruption that accompanied the Partition of India, Lady Mountbatten's priority was to mobilise the enormous relief efforts required, work for which she was widely praised. She continued to lead a life of service after her viceroyalty in India, including service for the St John Ambulance Brigade. She was a governor of The Peckham Experiment in 1949.\n\nLady Mountbatten died in her sleep at age 59 of unknown causes on 21 February 1960 in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu), British North Borneo (now Sabah), while on an inspection tour for the St John Ambulance Brigade. In accordance with her wishes she was buried at sea off the coast of Portsmouth from HMS \"Wakeful\" on 25 February 1960; Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. Nehru had the Indian Navy frigate INS \"Trishul\" escort the Wakeful and cast a wreath.

The Royal Asiatic Society's annual Boyce Prize for outstanding contributions to the study of religion is named after her.\n\nShe was born in Darjeeling where her parents were vacationing to escape the heat of the plains during the summer. Her father, William H. Boyce, was a Judge at the Calcutta high-court, then an institution of the British imperial government. Her mother Nora (née Gardiner) was a granddaughter of the historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner.\n\nBoyce was educated at Wimbledon High School and then Cheltenham Ladies' College. At Newnham College, Cambridge she studied English, archaeology and anthropology, graduating with a double first.\n\nIn 1944, Boyce joined the faculty of the Royal Holloway College, University of London, where she taught Anglo-Saxon literature and archaeology until 1946. Simultaneously she continued her studies, this time in Persian languages, under the guidance of Vladimir Minorsky at the School of Oriental and African Studies from 1945 to 1947. There she met her future mentor, Walter Bruno Henning, under whose tutelage she began to study Middle Iranian languages.\n\nIn 1948, Boyce was appointed lecturer of Iranian Studies at SOAS, specialising in Manichaean, Zoroastrian Middle Persian and Parthian texts. In 1952, she was awarded a doctorate in Oriental Studies from the University of Cambridge. At SOAS, she was promoted to Reader (1958–1961) and subsequently awarded the University of London's professorship in Iranian Studies following Henning's transfer to the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nBoyce remained professor at SOAS until her retirement in 1982, continuing as Professor \"Emerita\" and a professorial research associate until her death in 2006. Her speciality remained the religions of speakers of Eastern Iranian languages, in particular Manichaeanism and Zoroastrianism.\n\nBoyce was a recipient of the Royal Asiatic Society's Burton Medal, and of the Sykes Medal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs. She was a member of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, honorary member of the American Oriental Society, member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, and was the first secretary and treasurer of the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum\". She served on the editorial board of numerous academic publications, including \"Asia Major\", the \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\", the \"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies\", and the \"Journal of the American Oriental Society\".\n\nIn 1963–64, Boyce spent a research year among orthodox Zoroastrians of the 24 villages of Yazd, Iran. The results of her research there were formative to her understanding of Zoroastrianism and she discovered that much of the previously established scholarship on the ancient faith was terribly misguided. In 1975, Boyce presented the results of her research at her Ratanbai Katrak lecture series at Oxford University. In the same year she published the first volume of her magnum opus, \"The History of Zoroastrianism\", which appeared in the monograph series \"Handbuch der Orientalistik\" (Leiden:Brill). Her Ratanbai Katrak lecture series were published in 1977 as \"A Persian Stronghold of Zoroastrianism\".\n\nIn 1979, Boyce published \"Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices\", which not only summarised her previous publications (in particular volume 1 of \"History\"), but anthologised the role of Zoroastrianism during subsequent eras as well. This was followed by volume 2 of \"History of Zoroastrianism\" in 1982 (also as a part of the \"Orientalistik\" monograph series), and volume 3 in 1991 which she co-authored with Frantz Grenet. In 1992, she published \"Zoroastrianism: Its Antiquity and Constant Vigour\" as part of the Columbia Lectures on Iranian Studies which she had delivered there in 1985.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214744", "title": "His Majesty (comic opera)", "text": "His Majesty (comic opera)\n\nHis Majesty, or, The Court of Vingolia is an English comic opera in two acts with dialogue by F. C. Burnand, lyrics by R. C. Lehmann, additional lyrics by Adrian Ross and music by Alexander Mackenzie. \n\nThe work premiered at the Savoy Theatre in London on 20 February 1897, running for only 61 performances until 24 April 1897, despite a strong cast including George Grossmith, Ilka Pálmay, Scott Russell, Fred Billington, Florence Perry and Walter Passmore. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company then toured the opera throughout 1897 alongside more familiar Gilbert and Sullivan works.\n\nWhen the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership collapsed after the production of \"The Gondoliers\" in 1889, impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte struggled to find successful new works to present at the Savoy Theatre. He was able to bring Gilbert and Sullivan together briefly for two more operas, neither of which was a great success. In fact, after its disappointingly short run, their last piece, \"The Grand Duke\" (1896), was the only outright failure of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. Arthur Sullivan had produced two operas for the Savoy in the early 1890s with librettists other than W. S. Gilbert, but neither had proved particularly successful, and pieces by other composers, for example \"Mirette\", had fared worse. \n\nCarte assembled a high-quality team for \"His Majesty\", including the well-known dramatist and writer F. C. Burnand and the well-respected composer Alexander Mackenzie. Lyrics were supplied by Rudolph Lehmann, though his career gave no hint of a particular talent at writing verse.\n\nThe piece was expected to draw the public solely on the strength of the return of George Grossmith after an absence of almost a decade from the Savoy Theatre. Grossmith was well and fondly remembered for his creation there of the comedy roles in the famous series of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and during his years away, he had become the most popular solo piano entertainer in the country. The Savoy audience was eager to see him perform together on stage with his successor in the Savoy opera roles, Walter Passmore. Rehearsals began in December 1896, an unusually long rehearsal period for the Savoy, but Mackenzie later recalled that even the company felt that the work was not wanted. London's leading stage director, Charles Harris, was engaged, but he died a few days before the opera premiered, leaving the Cartes to finish his work. Richard D'Oyly Carte took ill, leaving the final arrangements to his wife, Helen. The Savoy's usual choreographer, John D'Auban arranged the dances.\n\nThe opening night met with instantaneous signs of disapproval. Grossmith received an ovation at his first appearance, but his entrance number met with a cool response from the house. \"The Whitehall Review\" declared that the audience preferred Passmore, and \"whenever he appeared on the scene, hearty applause greeted him.\" Though six encores were taken on the opening night, the piece seemed doomed to failure before its first public representation was complete. Only three principals came forward for their curtain call. Mackenzie was applauded warmly for his music, but when Burnand and Lehmann came forward, there was booing and hissing from all the private boxes and most of the pit.\n\nAlthough this would be his only comic opera, \"The Times\" called Mackenzie's score \"appropriate throughout, musicianly, and very often marked by distinction as well as humour,\" though it called the book dull and \"confused\". Other newspapers called Mackenzie's score \"a comic oratorio\", \"devoid of memorable tunes\" or \"peculiarly unattractive, almost entirely devoid of humour, strangely wanting in charm, brightness, fizz and spontaneity\" and opined that \"some of the best lines were appropriated to the most severe music\". The press uniformly found fault with the verbose libretto and felt that the music and book were not well suited to each other. They praised Passmore's comic acting but were disappointed by the nervous Grossmith, commenting that he was unsuited to the role of King Ferdinand. \nGrossmith lasted only four performances before pleading ill-health and returning to retirement. Charles H. Workman, playing Adam, filled in as Ferdinand until Henry Lytton arrived and was ready to play the King. The histrionic Hungarian actress, Ilka Pálmay, who had been engaged for \"The Grand Duke\" and was still under contract to Carte, played Felice, a role that gave her many opportunities to display her talents as ballad singer, opera soprano and comedian. Florence Perry, who had been playing smaller roles up to that point, was cast as Chloris.\n\nAlterations were made to the opera during Workman's tenure in the title role. Three songs were deleted, and the Act I Finale was shortened. Fred Billington became ill, and his part was taken by Jones Hewson for the remainder of the run. The opera closed on 24 April 1897 and was sent on tour with two D'Oyly Carte companies until September 1897, during which Mackenzie's autograph score was stolen.\n\nThe late father of King Ferdinand intended that Ferdinand marry Lucilla Chloris, the daughter of the king of Osturia, and Chloris has arrived at the Court of Vingolia for the wedding with her ladies. Ferdinand and the Princess have never met and have never seen any portrait of one\nanother. \n\nHowever, Ferdinand has fallen in love with the peasant maid Felice, the adopted daughter of an old woodman, and has wooed her while disguised as a court artist. Meanwhile, Princess Chloris is in love with Prince Max of Baluria. Prince Max devises a plan which, if carried out, will allow the Princess to elope with him, while Felice takes her place.\n\nBoodel, the King's former master of the revels, has been listening in on various conversations but only hears the end of each of them. He concludes that there is a plot afoot to assassinate Ferdinand. He becomes especially suspicious of a trunk carried by Felice. Preparations for war begin. But it turns out that Felice and her trunk bear a secret that changes everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2214764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214764", "title": "Eliza Armstrong case", "text": "Eliza Armstrong case\n\nThe Eliza Armstrong case was a major scandal in the United Kingdom involving a child supposedly bought for prostitution for the purpose of exposing the evils of white slavery. While it achieved its purpose of helping to enable the passage of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, it also brought unintended consequences to its chief perpetrator, W. T. Stead.\n\nSince the middle of the 19th century, efforts by the Social Purity movement, led by early feminists such as Josephine Butler and others, sought to improve the treatment of women and children in Victorian society. The movement scored a triumph when the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed under pressure due to their double standard nature and ultimate ineffectiveness.\n\nAt the same time, the campaign had also turned towards the problem of prostitution, and with male power over women. By the end of the 1870s, this had become particularly focused on fears that British women were being lured—or abducted—to brothels in the Continent, especially since this was happening to girls barely past the age of consent. Although the age was raised to 13 when amendments to the Offences against the Person Act 1861 were made in 1875, the movement sought to further raise this to at least 16, but Parliament was reluctant to make this change.\n\nHowever, a Criminal Law Amendment Bill to change this was introduced in 1881. While it passed the House of Lords easily in 1883 after a two-year Select committee study, it stalled twice in the House of Commons. Then in 1885, it was reintroduced for a third time, but again it was threatened to be set aside ultimately because of a political crisis and the upcoming general election that year.\n\nParliament recessed for the Whit Week bank holiday on 22 May, and the next day Benjamin Scott, anti-vice campaigner and the chamberlain of the City of London, went to see W. T. Stead, editor of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\". Stead was a pioneer of modern investigative journalism, with a flair for the sensational. He was a supporter of the Social Purity movement.\n\nScott told stories of sexually exploited children to Stead, who agreed to work for popular support. Stead set up a \"Special and Secret Committee of Inquiry\" to investigate child prostitution, which included Josephine Butler, as well as representatives of the London Committee for the Suppression of the Traffic in British Girls for the Purposes of Continental Prostitution (of which Scott was the chairman) and the Salvation Army. As part of the investigation, two women, an employee of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" and a girl from the Salvation Army, posed as prostitutes and infiltrated brothels, leaving before they were forced to render sexual services. Butler spent ten days walking the streets of London with her son Georgie, posing as a brothel-keeper and a procurer, respectively; together they spent a total of £100 buying children in high-class brothels. Stead, in turn, also spoke to a former director of criminal investigation at Scotland Yard to get first-hand information; he later cast his net wide to include active and retired brothel keepers, pimps, procurers, prostitutes, rescue workers and jail chaplains.\n\nStead felt that he needed something more to make his point: he decided to purchase a girl to show that he could do it under the nose of the law.\n\nWith the help of Josephine Butler and Bramwell Booth of the Salvation Army, Stead got in touch with Rebecca Jarrett, a reformed prostitute and brothel-keeper who was staying with Mrs Butler in Winchester as an assistant. Although Mrs Butler had no problem with Rebecca's meeting Stead, she did not know Stead's reason for doing so.\n\nStead prevailed upon Jarrett to help him to show that a 13-year-old girl could be bought from her parents and transported to the Continent. Despite her reluctance about returning to her old brothel contacts for help, Jarrett agreed to help.\n\nRebecca Jarrett met an old associate, a procuress called Nancy Broughton. Through her Jarrett learned of a 13-year-old named Eliza Armstrong, whose alcoholic mother Elizabeth was in need of money. She arranged for Jarrett to meet Mrs Armstrong, who lived in the Lisson Grove area of West London, and although Rebecca told the mother the girl was to serve as a maid to an old gentleman, she believed Mrs Armstrong understood that she was selling her daughter into prostitution. The mother agreed to sell her daughter for a total of £5 — equivalent to approximately £574 in 2014. On 3 June, the bargain was made.\n\nOn the same day, Jarrett then took Eliza to a midwife and abortionist named Louise Mourez, who examined her and attested to her virginity and sold Jarrett a bottle of chloroform. Then Eliza was taken to a brothel and lightly drugged to await the arrival of her purchaser, who was Stead. Stead, anxious to play the part of libertine almost in full, drank a whole bottle of champagne, although he was a teetotaler. He entered Eliza's room and waited for her to awaken from her stupor. When she came to, Eliza screamed. Stead quickly left the room, letting the scream imply he had \"had his way\" with her. Eliza was quickly handed over to Bramwell Booth, who spirited her to France, where she was taken care of by a Salvationist family.\n\nIn the meantime, Stead wrote his story.\n\nOn Saturday 4 July 1885, a \"frank warning\" was issued in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\": \"All those who are squeamish, and all those who are prudish, and all those who would prefer to live in a fool's paradise of imaginary innocence and purity, selfishly oblivious to the horrible realities which torment those whose lives are passed in the London inferno, will do well not to read the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" of Monday and the three following days\". The public's appetite whetted sufficiently in anticipation, on Monday 6 July, Stead published the first instalments of \"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\".\n\nThe first instalment taking up six whole pages, Stead attacked vice with eye-catching subheadings: \"The Violation of Virgins\", \"The Confessions of a Brothel-Keeper\", \"How Girls Were Bought and Ruined\". He argued that while consensual adult behavior was a matter of private morality and not a law enforcement issue, issues rife in London existed that did require legislative prohibition, listing five main areas where the law should intervene:\n\n\nThe theme of \"Maiden Tribute\" was child prostitution, the abduction, procurement and sale of young English virgins to Continental \"pleasure palaces\". Stead took his readers to the labyrinthine streets of London (intentionally recalling the Greek myth) to its darker side, exposing the flesh trade while exposing the corruption of those officials who not only turned a blind eye but also condoned such abuse. Stead acknowledged that his articles described the situation of a small minority of London's prostitutes, agreeing that most \"have not come there by the road of organized rape\", and that his focus was child victims who were \"regularly procured; bought..., or enticed under various promises into the fatal chamber from which they are never allowed to emerge until they have lost what woman ought to value more than life\". In particular, he drew a distinction between sexual \"immorality\" and sexual \"criminality\", and criticized those members of Parliament who were responsible for the Bill's impending \"extinction in the House of Commons\" and hinted that they might have personal reasons to block any changes in the law.\n\nThe disclosure began properly in the 6 July publication, in which Stead reveals that he had asked if genuine maiden virgins could be procured, and being told it was so, asked whether such girls were willing and consensual, or aware of the intentions planned for them:\n\nStead commented that \"Children of twelve and thirteen cannot offer any serious resistance. They only dimly comprehend what it all means. Their mothers sometimes consent to their seduction for the sake of the price paid by their seducer. The child goes to the introducing house as a sheep to the shambles. Once there, she is compelled to go through with it. No matter how brutal the man may be, she cannot escape\". A madam confirmed the story for him, stating of one girl that she was rendered unconscious beforehand, and then coercively given the choice to continue or be homeless afterwards.\n\nThe last section of the first instalment bore special mention: under the subheading \"A Child of Thirteen bought for £5\" Stead related the story of Eliza, a purchased victim, whose name he changed to \"Lily\". Although he vouched \"for the absolute accuracy of every fact in the narrative\", Stead changed a number of details, and omitted the fact that \"Lily's\" purchaser was none other than himself. Describing himself as an \"investigator\" rather than an \"informer\", and having also promised not to use information obtained against those who provided it, he stated that he would disclose actual names and identifying details only to the two UK Archbishops, one M.P., two members of the House of Lords active in criminal legislation or child protection, and a past director of the CID.\n\nThe \"Maiden Tribute\" was an instant hit. While W.H. Smith & Sons, who had a monopoly on all the news stalls, refused to sell the paper due to its lurid and prurient content, volunteers consisting of newsboys and members of the Salvation Army took over distribution. Even George Bernard Shaw telegraphed Stead offering to help. Crowds gathered in front of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" offices. Second-hand copies of the paper sold for up to a shilling — twelve times its normal price.\n\nWithin days, Stead had been getting telegrams from across the Atlantic inquiring about the scandal. By the end of the series he had thrown Victorian society into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt pleaded with Stead to cease publication of the articles; Stead replied that he would comply if the Bill would be passed without delay. Since Harcourt could not make that guarantee, Stead ordered the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" presses to continue until paper ran out.\n\nStead's revelations struck a responsive chord in the public. Amidst the hysteria, it provoked a wide variety of reform groups and prominent individuals to call for an end to the scandal. Dozens of protest meetings were held throughout London and the provincial towns. Thousands, including wagon loads of virgins dressed in white, marched to Hyde Park demanding that the Bill be passed. The government was soon on the defensive and those members of Parliament who had previously opposed the Bill, now understood that opposition would not only mean denying the existence of child prostitution, but condoning it as well. While many of them wanted to have the paper prosecuted under obscenity laws, they bowed to the inevitable. On Wednesday 8 July debate resumed over the bill, on 7 August it passed its third and final reading, and passed into law a week later.\n\nAlthough Stead was supported in his investigation by the Salvation Army and religious leaders including Cardinal Henry Edward Manning and Charles John Ellicott, the Bishop of Bristol, his plan backfired on him. Rival newspapers, including \"The Times\", investigated the original \"Lily\" and found that Stead was the \"purchaser\". Mrs Armstrong told police that she had not consented to put her daughter into prostitution, saying she understood that she would enter domestic service. Jarrett did not get the permission of the child's father.\n\nStead, Jarrett, Booth and Louise Mourez, the midwife, and two others appeared in court on 2 September charged with the assault and abduction for Eliza Armstrong without the agreement of her parents.\n\nOn 23 October, the defendants were brought to trial, with the Attorney General, Richard Webster, acting as prosecutor. Stead defended himself. He admitted that the girl was procured without the consent of the father and that he had no written evidence of payment to the mother. Stead had relied on Rebecca Jarrett's word, and was unable to prove Mrs Armstrong's complicity in the crime. Stead, Jarrett and Mourez were found guilty of abduction and procurement. The others were acquitted. Jarrett and Mourez were sentenced to six months in jail and Stead was sentenced to three months. He was sent to Coldbath Fields Prison for three days and then to Holloway as a first-class inmate for the rest of his sentence.\n\nMany groups protested against Stead's imprisonment, and he was treated well in prison. \"Never had I a pleasanter holiday, a more charming season of repose\", he later said. In Holloway as a \"first class misdemeanant\" he had his own room with an open fire and a fellow prisoner as a servant to tend to him. His wife and children were allowed in for Christmas. Mourez died in jail. Jarrett survived her six months with hard labour. While in prison, he continued to edit the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", and his Christmas card played up his martyrdom. Stead wrote a threepenny pamphlet of his prison experience soon after his release. He asked the prison governor whether he could keep his prison uniform, although he spent much of his sentence in ordinary civilian street clothes. The governor agreed, and thereafter, every 10 November, the anniversary of his conviction, Stead would dress up in his prison garb to remind people of his \"triumph\".\n\nAfter the trial the prosecutor, surnamed Poland, started a public subscription for the Armstrong family through an advertisement in \"The Times\". The money paid for Eliza to attend a training centre for girls to become servants. She lost connection with the Salvation Army after her return from France, and details of her later life are unknown.\n\nStead died in the \"Titanic\" disaster.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214780", "title": "Suppressive Person", "text": "Suppressive Person\n\nSuppressive Person, often abbreviated SP, is a term used in Scientology to describe the \"antisocial personalities\" who, according to Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard, make up about 2.5% of the population. A statement on a Church of Scientology website describes this group as including notorious historic figures such as Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe term is often applied to those whom the Church perceives as its enemies, such as those whose \"disastrous\" and \"suppressive\" acts are said to impede the progress of individual Scientologists or the Scientology movement.\n\nOne of the reasons Scientology doctrines portray Suppressive Persons as such a danger is that they are supposed to make people around them become Potential Trouble Sources (abbreviated PTS). Scientology defines a PTS as \"a person who is in some way connected to and being adversely affected by a suppressive person. Such a person is called a potential trouble source because he can be a lot of trouble to himself and to others.\" Hubbard suggested that Potential Trouble Sources make up 17.5% of the population.\n\nAs with most Scientology terminology, \"Suppressive Person\" was coined by L. Ron Hubbard. Ruth A. Tucker writes in her book \"Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement\" that the concept appears to have first been introduced into Scientology in the 1960s \"as membership grew and as authoritarian control [by Hubbard] increased\". Tucker notes that many of those who joined Scientology during this period were \"well-educated people who prided themselves in independent thinking [and] struggled with the idea of allowing any other individual to completely dominate their opinions.\" Many of Hubbard's early writings on Suppressive Persons focus on their alleged responsibility for poor management within the Church of Scientology.\n\nThe church's official glossary defines a Suppressive Person as being:a person who possesses a distinct set of characteristics and mental attitudes that cause him to suppress other people in his vicinity. This is the person whose behavior is calculated to be disastrous. Also called \"antisocial personality\".\n\nThe church regards these \"antisocial personalities\" as being those \"who possess characteristics and mental attitudes that cause them to violently oppose any betterment activity or group,\" This concern with \"groups\" continues in the official \"Scientology Handbook\", which states the corollary: \"The antisocial personality supports only destructive groups.\"\n\nAccording to the Hubbard textbook \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\" (\"the Ethics book\"), when an individual is found to be under the influence of a Suppressive Person, it is believed that this will affect their general well-being. An individual with an SP in their vicinity is likely to be under stress or frequently upset, and this would potentially jeopardize the stability of any treatment or education. Therefore, a parishioner who is found to have such suppressive connections is not permitted to participate in certain Scientology classes and counseling until the situation has been adequately resolved.\n\nThe Ethics book provides a guideline for use in sorting out such a condition. A first step is always to educate the person about the phenomenon of the Suppressive Person and the effects this is believed to have on the individuals close to the SP. Once the education step is completed, the person can further follow the guidelines to sort out the situation so that the parishioner is no longer negatively affected.\n\nScientology Security checks are also common for SP and PTS situations. If reasonable attempts have been made to \"handle\" the situation to no avail, the parishioner may take the option of \"disconnecting\" from the SP. In \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\", \"disconnection\" is defined as a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another. It is a severing of communication by one individual against the other.\n\nThe concept of the Suppressive Person in Scientology has been the source of some controversy, due in some part to aversion to the idea of \"disconnecting\" from close family members and friends.\n\nAnother source of controversy related to the Suppressive Person doctrine is the formal administrative judgment that labels an individual a \"Suppressive Person\". This is known as an \"SP Declare\", and has been issued as a \"Flag Ethics Order\" since 1976. This is because presently, an SP Declare needs to be approved by the \"International Justice Chief\" (IJC), who resides at Gold Base, which is not a formal Scientology office and thus not authorized to issue Ethics Orders.\n\nNon-Scientologists can be and have been labelled Suppressive Persons. A Suppressive Person is anyone who has been responsible for \"suppressive acts\", defined by Hubbard as being \"the overt or covert actions or omissions knowingly and willfully undertaken to suppress, reduce, prevent or destroy case gains, and/or the influence of Scn on activities, and/or the continued Scn success and actions on the part of organizations actions and Scientologists.\" Similarly, entire groups can be declared Suppressive; Suppressive Groups, in Hubbard's view, are \"those which seek to destroy Scn or which specialize in injuring or killing persons or damaging their cases or which advocate suppression of mankind.\" Under this broader definition, suppressiveness included more than just publicly opposing Scientology; it also included any group supporting activities to which Hubbard was strongly opposed, especially psychiatry. Specifically, Hubbard considered reporters and government agents to be members of Suppressive Groups: \"There are no good reporters. There are no good government or SP group agents. The longer you try to be nice, the worse off you will be. And the sooner one learns this, the happier he will be.\"\n\nThe Church of Scientology maintains a central list of ex-members and splinter groups formally declared to be Suppressive. In an executive directive of 1992, the Church's \"International Justice Chief\" lists over 400 groups and over 2,300 individuals considered to be Suppressive. The list includes individual ex-Scientologists and breakaway groups regarded as hostile or heretical, such as Erhard Seminars Training (EST).\n\nIn a lecture he made on 19 July 1966, L. Ron Hubbard expressed concern about the possible abuse of the \"Suppressive Person\" label in respect of those who are otherwise good citizens and contribute to civil society:\n\nYou should upgrade your idea of what an SP is. Man, meet one sometime! A real one! A real monster...Well, in all the time we've been around here we only had one SP that I know of. One real SP that was on staff... And I don't know of another single SP that we've ever had on staff. Isn't that interesting. You see all these SP orders and so on...Don't throw it around carelessly, because this is an—a very exaggerated condition, SP.\n\nSome former Scientologists have alleged that there has indeed been such abuse. For example, Bent Corydon describes seeing Scientology franchise holder Gary Smith declared Suppressive on the spot during the October 1982 Mission Holders' Conference, simply for not obeying a shouted order to change his seat.\nThere are also instances where SP declarations have disrupted families and businesses.\n\nAccording to a 2006 \"St. Petersburg Times\" article entitled \"SP profiles\", one Scientologist found himself declared an SP after he repeatedly challenged the validity of a \"patter drill\" in which he was instructed to read passages of a course to a wall. He insisted the drill was not based on Hubbard teachings and stated that he had been previously threatened with an SP declare after a run-in with a Scientology attorney on an unrelated issue.\n\nThose who communicate with Suppressive Persons can face being branded SPs themselves by Scientology. Associates of the branded SP are ordered to disconnect from that person. Religious scholars have taken a negative view of Scientology's disconnection policies, which includes many who have previously testified on behalf of Scientology. For example, religious scholar J. Gordon Melton stated, \"I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it. The policy hurts everybody.\"\n\n\n"}

Between the end of the war and 1959, when Deutermann entered the Naval Academy, the family lived in various places throughout the United States and also in Argentina. Deutermann attended parochial, public, and Jesuit high schools, graduating from Creighton Preparatory in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1959.\n\nDeutermann was commissioned in 1963 in Annapolis, Maryland into the surface line, where he was ordered to the new destroyer . He served on the \"Morton\" for two years, and was on board for the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident in September 1964, which precipitated the first significant aircraft carrier strikes against North Vietnam.\n\nFollowing his tour on the \"Morton\", he was assigned to class 13 of the destroyer department head school in Newport, Rhode Island. Upon graduation he was diverted from the destroyer forces to Coronado, California, to train in the new Swift class gunboats.

He was then assigned to The Pentagon for three years, serving on a joint command and control computer integration project.\n\nFollowing shore duty, Deutermann returned to sea, this time in the Atlantic Fleet as executive officer of the guided missile destroyer , which made two deployments to the Mediterranean over the following two years. He returned to the Pentagon in 1978 as a staff officer in the politico-military policy division of the Navy headquarters staff. He published his first book in 1980, a handbook for navy operations officers, through the Naval Institute Press in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nIn 1981 Deutermann assumed command of the guided missile destroyer for a three-year tour of duty, which included combat operations off Lebanon. Following that assignment he was appointed the executive secretary to the Chief of Naval Operations for JCS matters in Washington, D.C. In late 1985, he assumed command of Destroyer Squadron 25, based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for two years, during which he made one deployment to the Indian Ocean, where he visited Kenya, Pakistan, Singapore and Japan.\n\nUpon conclusion of this tour Deutermann was assigned to the Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) in London, England, for one year. It was an international course studying the influence of military affairs on geopolitics, whose members represented forty different nations. In 1988 he returned to the Pentagon as head of the Strategy Planning branch of the Navy staff. He was then assigned as division director of the arms-control negotiations office concerned with chemical, biological, and radiation weapons on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was also appointed as a technical delegate to the United Nations, and participated in arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union in Geneva.\n\nDeutermann served for 26 years in the Navy, retiring in 1989. He earned 19 military awards and decorations. He then worked successively for three companies between 1989 and 1993, which supported the FAA in the procurement of large-scale computer systems.\n\nAfter retiring from active duty, Deutermann moved to Georgia to work on his writing career. He published his first novel, entitled \"Scorpion in the Sea\", in 1992 through the George Mason University Press. The book landed him an agent, and then a contract with St. Martin's Press in 1993. Three of his later books have been optioned for feature film development. \"Nightwalkers\", was published May 26, 2009.\nIn 2012, he was named the recipient of the W.Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction by the American Library Association for his novel \"Pacific Glory\".\n\nSince the late 1990s, Deutermann has served on the board of directors for two high-tech companies and on the board of advisors of the SpaceVest Venture Capital Group in Washington, D.C.\n\nDeutermann married Susan Cornelia Degenhardt, of Gainesville, Florida in 1968.

{"id": "2214787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214787", "title": "Tormented (Staind album)", "text": "Tormented (Staind album)\n\nTormented is the debut studio album by the American rock band Staind, self-released in 1996. In 1993, Staind vocalist Aaron Lewis and Staind guitarist Mike Mushok met each other at a Christmas party in the New England area. Mushok brought drummer Jon Wysocki into the fold and Lewis had a connection with a bass guitarist who later left, starting the early lineup. Staind was originally a cover band, covering songs by bands like Deftones, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Korn, Tool, Rage Against the Machine, Helmet, and Stone Temple Pilots. Shortly after bassist Johnny April joined, Staind officially formed in Springfield, Massachusetts on November 24, 1995. Touring in the Northeast United States helped Staind obtain a cult following.\n\n\"Tormented\" was self-released on November 29, 1996. Promoting \"Tormented\", Staind played gigs throughout New England with bands such as God Lives Underwater, Gwar, and Kilgore. \"Tormented\" helped get Staind a record deal with Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst and the record label Flip Records. Durst was initially appalled when he saw the album's graphic cover art, but signed Staind after being impressed with the band's performance. \n\n\"Tormented\" received minor attention after its release, selling at least a few thousand copies. Critical reception was positive towards the heaviness and aggression of \"Tormented\", but was negative towards the album's production. Described as a alternative metal and heavy metal album by critics, \"Tormented\" is somewhat of a concept album that tells the story of a depressed person who eventually commits suicide. The album contains an early version of \"Mudshovel\", named \"Mudshuvel\", the breakthrough song which would give Staind mainstream popularity in 1999.\n\nIn 1993, Staind vocalist Aaron Lewis and Staind guitarist Mike Mushok met at a Christmas party in Springfield, Massachusetts. Mushok brought drummer Jon Wysocki into the band and Lewis had a connection with a bass guitar player who later left, completing the early lineup of the band in early 1995. Originally, Staind went by the name Stain, but changed the name to Staind after the band found out the moniker already had been claimed by another group. Staind originally covered songs by bands such as Korn, Tool, Alice in Chains, Rage Against the Machine, Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, Deftones, and Helmet. The band played their first gig in February 1995. The band officially formed in Springfield, Massachusetts on November 24, 1995, after Johnny April joined the same month replacing the original bassist. By 1996, Staind obtained the $2,500 they needed for recording \"Tormented\". While \"Tormented\" was being written and recorded, Lewis reportedly was going through the throes of the breakup of a four-year relationship. Extensive touring in the Northeast United States helped Staind acquire an underground following. In a 2008 interview, Lewis elaborated on the motivation for the musical style featured on \"Tormented\":\nThe songs on \"Tormented\" are about topics such as pain, animosity, suicide and depression. Author Tommy Udo wrote: \"\"Tormented\" is one long rush of hardcore a 900mph scream of a man smashing his head against a wall with frustration\". According to \"Rockzone\", \"Tormented\" \"revealed the raw feelings of a band whose front man Aaron Lewis captivated the minds and souls of teenagers and young adults tired of the vanity that has overcome life.\" Described as alternative metal by AllMusic, \"Tormented\" is also somewhat of a concept album that tells the story of a depressed person who eventually commits suicide. This is hinted by the spoken-word line, \"it's been like this forever... no more... I hate my fucking life\", followed by the sound of a gun being cocked before the first song, \"Tolerate\"; this thematic device returns with the line \"there's nothing left for me\" and then the sound of a gunshot immediately after the song \"Four Walls\" and before the hidden track \"Funeral\".\n\nThe lyrics on \"Tormented\" are influenced by Staind frontman Aaron Lewis' life. Lewis spoke about it, saying: \"My life, up to a point was shit. But I've come a long way. I grew up in a trailer park in Vermont. That was the shit I got out of me in \"Tormented\" and \"Dysfunction\", and tailing into \"Break the Cycle\". But the title, \"Break the Cycle\", says it all.\" The lyrics on \"Tormented\" have created controversy, with lyrics to songs like \"Tolerate\" and \"Four Walls\" showing themes of violence and antisocial values. AllMusic described \"Tormented\" as \"grittier and more raw than\" Staind's \"subsequent releases\". The album's music, which features singing and screaming, has been compared to that of the heavy metal band Pantera.\n\nAccording to the \"Lollipop\", Staind combine grunge-influenced hooks with heavy metal-style drums and guitars. Describing the vocals on \"Tormented\", \"Lollipop\" elaborated: \"Vocally, it may seem odd to say a band can have the passionate trembling of, ya know, those Seattle bands, yet have a desperate howl that is rather Kornesque.\" According to Allmusic, \"Tormented\" shows influences from Tool, Faith No More, and Pantera. In 2008, Staind guitarist Mike Mushok expressed his lack of appreciation for \"Tormented\": \"We have a lot of fans who say, 'I love \"Tormented\".' I'm like, 'Have you ever listened to it? Because I can't.'\" Despite being an intense heavy metal album, \"Tormented\" song \"Four Walls\" is rather soft. While \"Tormented\" has been described as alternative metal and heavy metal by critics, the album's songs \"Come Again\" and \"Mudshuvel\" are both considered nu metal songs.\n\nSelf-released on November 29, 1996, \"Tormented\" was launched with a record-release party which drew at least 900 people, with many obtaining the album. Being distributed to local record stores and at concerts, 2,000 copies of \"Tormented\" were sold within a year and \"Tormented\" was later available on Staind's website. \"Tormented\" had only sold a few thousand copies by 2002. Promoting the release of \"Tormented\", Staind played gigs throughout New England with bands such as God Lives Underwater, Gwar, and Kilgore.\n\nAnthony Tognazzini of AllMusic gave the album a very positive review, writing: \"[\"Tormented\"] shows a band with its alternative metal heart in the right place [...] Despite some spotty production, this impressive debut unleashes a band whose amps are overloaded, and whose aim is deadly. The original version of \"Mudshuvel\" (which later appeared on \"Dysfunction\") is one of several highlights.\" In 1997, Steven Woltasek of \"CMJ New Music Report\" wrote: \"For those of you that don't know, wake up and look around for the debut release from Staind entitled In the book \"Brave Nu World\", author Tommy Udo wrote: \"To go back now and listen to Staind's 1996 debut, \"Tormented\", back to back with \"Break The Cycle\" is like listening to another band\". Scott Hefflon of the \"Lollipop\" wrote: \"Staind are savvy, street-smart, and dammit, they rock. Their studio debut, \"tOrmenteD\", shows either a natural knack for milking the most out of a crunchy guitar, or they had some good coaching.\" The \"Northeast Performer\" wrote: \"Staind's musicianship is striking, and their live performance takes their recorded material one step further: pushing the envelope, ripping up the envelope, then jumping up and down all over the envelope til there ain't a damn thing left\". Andrew Blackie of \"PopMatters\" wrote about \"Tormented\": \"It’s disarming how heavy\" Staind \"were in those days, how screaming misery ... over harsh, sololess distortions made them sound more like the protégé of Pantera than the descendants of Alice in Chains they do today.\"\n\nThe album is known for its graphic cover art. The cover depicts a bloody Barbie doll on a crucifix with nails hanging from a plastic frame, a buried person with a rosary protruding from the person's nose, and a knife impaling a Bible. On October 23, 1997, when Staind met Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst at the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut, \"Tormented\" album cover appalled Durst so much that he attempted to remove Staind from a concert bill shortly before their performance. Durst thought that Staind were Theistic Satanists. Despite his attempts to stop the band from performing, Durst eventually changed his mind and allowed Staind to perform. After hearing Staind perform, Durst was so impressed that he signed them to Flip Records by February 1998. Durst produced Staind's second album \"Dysfunction\" (1999).\n\nMushok said he \"tried to get\" Durst \"to calm down\", explaining to Durst that the cover art was meant to portray someone \"who seemed normal going through a difficult time\". Mushok said the cover art represents \"someone who had lost belief in everything\". According to Mushok, the cover art was not meant to be a religious thing. Mushok said the cover art \"came out\" as a religious thing \"because the Bible was the most shocking image.\" Lewis said that the album cover \"was twisted and demented and it totally did what it was supposed to do, which is shock the hell out of [Durst]\". Lewis then said nonetheless, Durst \"didn't find it shocking in an amusing way. It definitely grabbed your attention. That was the point of it.\" Lewis also has said about \"Tormented\" album cover: \"That artwork depicted where I was at in my life,\" Lewis says. \"I had lost faith in everything, from religion to love to life.\" Staind reportedly thought later that the album cover for \"Tormented\" was naïve. According to Mushok, Staind \"had to move back the CD release party because four different places would not print the CD cover\". \"Tormented\" also has artwork that shows the album's titles in smeared blood similar to the Charles Manson tradition. Backwards letters are also used on the song titles.\n\nThe \"Tormented\" track \"Mudshuvel\" was re-recorded and renamed \"Mudshovel\" as a radio-friendly version and the re-recorded version was released in 1999 as the third single for Staind's second studio album \"Dysfunction\". It became the band's breakthrough single and the most popular song from their second studio album, ranking on the Mainstream Rock chart for 28 weeks where it peaked at number 10 in November 1999. The \"Tormented\" track \"Come Again\" is on Staind's 2006 . \"Come Again\" also appears on a sampler which was both free and available for fans who Staind's 2005 studio album \"Chapter V\". The \"Tormented\" track \"See Thru\" was for the 2002 soundtrack album \"NASCAR on Fox: Crank It Up\". For a long time, Staind have not played many songs from \"Tormented\" except for \"Tolerate\", \"Come Again\", and \"Break\".\n\n\nCredits are adapted from AllMusic.\n\n"}

These flagship disks for the 64DD peripheral were developed to turn the game console into an Internet multimedia workstation. A bundle of the 64DD unit, software disks, hardware accessories, and the Randnet online service subscription package was released in Japan starting in December 1999.\n\nDevelopment was managed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development and Nintendo of America, in conjunction with two other independent development companies: \"Polygon Studio\" was developed by the professional 3D graphics software developer, Nichimen Graphics; and \"Paint Studio\" was developed by Software Creations of the UK.\n\nTitled \"Mario Paint 64\" in development, \"Paint Studio\" was conceived as the sequel to \"Mario Paint\" (1992) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. IGN called \"Talent Studio\" the 64DD's \"killer app\".\n\nMario Artist: Paint Studio, released on December 11, 1999, is a Mario-themed paint program. The user has a variety of brush sizes, textures, and stamps, with which to paint, draw, spray, sketch, and animate. The stock Nintendo-themed graphics include all 151 \"Red\"- and \"Blue\"-era Pokémon, \"Banjo-Kazooie\", and \"Diddy Kong Racing\" characters. Previously titled \"Mario Paint 64\" in development, \"Paint Studio\" has been described as the \"direct follow-up\" and \"spiritual successor\" to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's \"Mario Paint\", and as akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids.\n\nOn June 1, 1995, Nintendo of America commissioned the independent UK game studio Software Creations, soliciting a single design concept for \"a sequel to \"Mario Paint\" in 3D for the N64\". John Pickford initially pitched a 3D \"living playground\", where the user edits the attributes of premade models such as dinosaursplaying with sizes, behaviors, aggression, speed, and texture design. The project's working title was \"Creator\", then \"Mario Paint 64\", then \"Picture Maker\", and then \"Mario Artist & Camera\". Software Creations reflected on political infighting between Nintendo's two sites: \"eventually the Japanese took control and rejected many of the ideas which had been accepted enthusiastically by the Americans, steering the project in a different direction after John left Software Creations to form Zed Two, and throwing away loads of work.\" The audio functionality was split out into \"Sound Studio\" (also known as \"Sound Maker\") and then canceled.\n\nPublished as a bundle with the Nintendo 64 Mouse, it is one of the two 64DD launch games on December 11, 1999 along with \"Doshin the Giant\". Utilizing the Nintendo 64 Capture Cassette cartridge (released later in a bundle with \"Talent Studio\"), the user can import images and movies from any NTSC video source such as video tape or a video camera. The Japanese version of the Game Boy Camera can import grayscale photographs via the Transfer Pak. The studio features a unique four player drawing mode. Minigames include a fly swatting game reminiscent of that in \"Mario Paint\", and a game reminiscent of \"Pokémon Snap\".\n\nMario Artist: Talent Studio, released on February 23, 2000, is bundled with the Nintendo 64 Capture Cartridge. Its working title was \"Talent Maker\" and it was described by designer Shigeru Miyamoto as \"a newly reborn \"Mario Paint\"\" upon a brief demonstration at the Game Developers Conference in March 1999 as his example of a fresh game concept.\n\nThe game presents the player's character design as being a self-made television stage talent or celebrity. It is a simple animation production studio which lets the user insert captured images such as human faces onto 3D models which had been made with \"Polygon Studio\", dress up the models from an assortment of hundreds of clothes and accessories, and then animate the models with sound, music, and special effects. The player can connect an analog video source such as a VCR or camcorder to the Capture Cartridge and record movies on the Nintendo 64. A photograph of a person's face from a video source via the Capture Cassette or from the Game Boy Camera via the Transfer Pak, may be mapped onto the characters created in \"Polygon Studio\" and placed into movies created with \"Talent Studio\".\n\nIGN describes \"Talent Studio\" as the 64DD's \"killer app\" with a graphical interface that's \"so easy to use that anyone can figure it out after a few minutes\", letting the user create \"fashion shows, karate demonstrations, characters waiting outside a bathroom stall, and more\" which feature the user's own face. Those avatars can be imported into the completely separate 64DD game, \"SimCity 64\". Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki attributes his work on \"Talent Studio\" as having been foundational to his eventual work on the Mii.\n\nAccording to Shigeru Miyamoto, \"Talent Studio\"s direct descendant is a GameCube prototype called \"Stage Debut\", using the Game Boy Advance's GameEye camera peripheral and linking to the GameCube via a cable, to map self-portraits of players onto their character models. It was publicly demonstrated with models of Miyamoto and eventual Nintendo president Satoru Iwata. Never having been released, its character design features became the Mii, the Mii Channel, and features of games such as \"Wii Tennis\".\nMario Artist: Communication Kit, released on June 29, 2000, is a utility application which allowed users to connect to the Net Studio of the now-defunct Randnet dialup service and online community for 64DD users. In Net Studio, it was possible to share creations made with \"Paint Studio\", \"Talent Studio\", or \"Polygon Studio\", with other Randnet members. Other features included contests, and printing services available by online mail order for making custom 3D papercraft and postcards. The Randnet network service was launched and discontinued alongside the 64DD, running from December 1, 1999 to February 28, 2001.\n\nThe disk has content that may be unlocked and used in \"Paint Studio\".\n\nMario Artist: Polygon Studio, released on August 29, 2000, is a 3D computer graphics editor that lets the user design and render 3D polygon images with a simple level of detail. It was originally announced as \"Polygon Maker\" at Nintendo Space World '96 and renamed to \"Polygon Studio\" at Space World '99. The game was scheduled to be the final title in the original Starter Kit's mail order delivery of 64DD games, but it didn't arrive on time, leading IGN to assume it was canceled until it was later released. The Expansion Pak and the Nintendo 64 Mouse are supported peripherals.\n\nThe idea of minigames was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64's fifth generation of video game consoles, and some early minigames appear in \"Polygon Studio\" in the style that would later be used in the \"WarioWare\" series of games. Certain minigames originated in \"Polygon Studio\", as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R&D1's so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team:\n\nThe art form of papercraft was implemented by modeling the characters in \"Polygon Studio\" and then utilizing \"Communication Kit\" to upload the data to Randnet's online printing service. The user finally cuts, folds, and pastes the resulting colored paper into a physically 3D figure.\n\n\nNintendo World Report described the \"Mario Artist\" series as a \"spiritual successor to \"Mario Paint\"\". IGN collectively describes the \"Mario Artist\" suite as a layperson's analog to professional quality graphics development software. They state that the combination of the 64DD's mass writability and the Nintendo 64's 3D graphics allows Nintendo to \"leave CD systems behind\", by offering \"something that couldn't be done on any other gaming console on the market\" to people \"who want to unleash their creative talents and perhaps learn a little bit about graphics design on the side\".

Peer Schneider described it as a powerful, affordable, and easy-to-use 2D and 3D content creation tool unmatched by other video game consoles, although minimally comparable to personal computer applications. He likens it to an edutainment version of Adobe Photoshop for children, and a good neophyte introduction to the Internet. He considers \"Paint Studio\" to embody Nintendo's originally highly ambitious plans for 64DD, and to thus suffer greatly due to the cancellation of most \"Paint Studio\"-integrated disk games and the application's incompatibility with cartridge-based games.\n\n\"Polygon Studio\" contains some mini games, which appear in \"WarioWare\" games of future console generations.\n\n\"Talent Studio\" gave rise to an unreleased GameCube prototype called \"Stage Debut\", which in turn yielded character design features which became the Mii, the Mii Channel, and features of other games such as \"Wii Tennis\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2214827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214827", "title": "Phil Bolger", "text": "Phil Bolger\n\nPhilip C. Bolger (December 3, 1927 – May 24, 2009) was a prolific American boat designer, who was born and lived in Gloucester, Massachusetts. He began work full-time as a draftsman for boat designers Lindsay Lord and then John Hacker in the early 1950s.\n\nBolger's first boat design was a 32-foot (9.75 m) sportfisherman published in the January 1952 issue of \"Yachting\" magazine. He subsequently designed more than 668 different boats, from a 114-foot-10-inch (35 m) replica of an eighteenth-century naval warship, the frigate \"Surprise\" (ex-\"Rose\"), to the 6-foot-5-inch (1.96 m) plywood box-like dinghy Tortoise.\n\nAlthough his designs ranged through the full spectrum of boat types, Bolger tended to favor simplicity over complexity. Many of his hulls are made from sheet materials — typically plywood — and have hard chines. A subclass of these designed in association with Harold Payson called \"Instant Boats\" were so named because they were intended to be easily built by amateurs out of commonly available materials. Bolger also advocated the use of traditional sailing rigs and leeboards.\n\nFrom the 1990s, Phil Bolger teamed with his wife Susanne Altenburger, designing boats under the name Phil Bolger & Friends Inc. During this time, they emphasized the design of sustainable and fuel-efficient boats for the fishing industry. Also, they participated in a large military commission with the Naval Sea Systems Command on new designs for military landing craft utility boats.\n\nBolger was a prolific writer and wrote many books, the last being \"Boats with an Open Mind\", as well as hundreds of magazine articles on small craft designs, chiefly in \"Woodenboat\", \"Small Boat Journal\" and \"Messing About in Boats\".\n\nBolger died on May 24, 2009, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His wife explained that \"[h]is mind had slipped in the last several months, and he wanted to control the end of his life while he was still able.\"\n\nPhil Bolger was unconventional in many ways and, among many large boats, yachts and custom designs, took an interest in what he termed \"evolving crafty ways of building boats\". As far back as 1957 he designed \"Poohsticks\" as a small plywood rowing skiff to be simply and economically built at home (originally by his brother). From this simple start he went on to develop a large number of designs for small- and medium-sized craft using plywood as a material for one-off construction at home or by small boatyards.\nIn the 1970s, Phil Bolger began a long and successful collaboration with Harold 'Dynamite' Payson with Bolger designing the boats and Payson building them as well as selling plans and writing books about how to do it. 'Dynamite' called the first series of easy-to-build plywood boats \"Instant Boats\". Unlike traditional boat construction which involves building of jig and full size lofting of the shape of the hull prior to construction, the Instant Boat method uses shaped plywood panels on pre-shaped frames made of plywood and standard dimensional lumberyard wood. This results in quick construction and less requirement for skilled craftsmanship, and has proved appealing to amateur boat builders as well as many later designers who have followed in his footsteps, albeit much less prolifically.\n\nFollowing articles in WoodenBoat magazine, Dynamite Payson published \"Instant Boats\" (1979, 152 pages, 7\" × 10\", 48 illustrations). It describes the original \"Instant Boat\" technique. Generically known as the \"chine log method\" or \"simplified chine log method\" the technique consists of (i) cutting body panels to a predetermined shape as given on the plans, (ii) wrapping them around frames or bulkheads, (iii) adding chines (small section planks of lumberyard wood) along the joints (either internally or externally) and fastening them together using glue and mechanical fasteners (nails or screws). The book described all the basic techniques (gluing, nailing and screwing with some fiberglass) to produce five designs: 12' Teal, 7'9\" Elegant Punt, 12' Kayak, 31' Folding Schooner, 15'6\" Surf, and 20'9\" Zephyr. All these boats have single chines (i.e. have a bottom panel and two sides) and have their shape limited by the bevels given to the chines. The boats in Paysons book were designed for use on protected waters and none was self-bailing or designed to self-recover in case of capsize. However, Bolger designed many other boats using this building technique, including the ocean crossing AS-39 (or Loose Moose II) as well as a significant number of other boats.\n\nBolger's first generation of \"chine log instant boats\" for home building was followed by a generation of \"stitch and glue\" (aka \"tack and tape\") boats. This technique was made possible by the evolution of glues and the massification of polyester and epoxy resins combined with fiberglass tape. The new technique basically did away with the chine logs and mechanical fasteners and all the problems associated with their use (mainly the limitation of shape in the design phase, the carpentry challenge in the construction phase and damp/rot in the medium to long term). Instead of using a chine to join the precut panels, in stitch and glue, the preshaped panels are wrapped around bulkheads and/or frames in the same way as before. However, the panels are only temporarily held in place using nails, duct tape, cable ties, masking tape, wire or other mechanical means, while the seams are filled (both inside and outside the hull) with a resin and filler paste covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth or tape which in turn is saturated in resin. Once the resin hardens, the mechanical joint is stronger than the joined plywood and therefore structurally sound. Payson again popularised the technique in his book \"Build the New Instant Boats\" (1984, 160 pages, 8\" × 11\", 110 illustrations - Also still in print). In this book Payson introduces what he termed \"Tack and tape\" to the greater American public. The book includes plans for Gypsy (15' sail/oar/outboard), Nymph (7'9\" dinghy with sail option), Diablo (15' motor boat for up to 25 HP outboard) as well as 8 more \"traditional instant boats\" using the chine log method: 16' Lug-rigger Windsprint, 6'5\" Tortoise, 8' Skimmer, Dynamite Sailboard, 16'June Bug, Madeline a 19'6\" Pedal-driven sidewheeler and the 23'6\" Light Schooner. In 2007 Payson published his last book \"Instant Boatbuilding with Dynamite Payson\" which basically explains both techniques in less detail than the previous books and presents complete plans for 15 boats by Bolger. These are: Stitch and Glue: Payson's Pirogue (13' - canoe), Cartopper (11'6\" - sail/oar), Sweet Pea (15' - sail/oar), Ruben's Nymph (7'9\" - identical to Nymph but 1' wider - sail/oar), Diablo Grande (18' - power), Catfish (15' - sail/outboard) and Chebacco (19'8\" - sail/outboard). The\n\nBolger put a lot of thought into relatively cheap, high-performance boats. He is well known for designing a series of single chine sharpies, typically long and narrow with a flat bottom.\n\nAccording to Bolger, sailing sharpies give good performance for the amount of sail they carry because of low to moderate displacement and light weight. In his opinion, the sharpie shape provides a simple construction in the plywood era with the added benefit that sailing sharpies extend the waterline as they heel, thereby effectively increasing the hull speed. Power sharpies can use low-horsepower motors (see, for example, the Bolger \"Tennessee,\" and \"Sneakeasy\" designs) yet reach planing speeds in sheltered waters. Major critics of sharpies point to the fact that they tend to pound under certain conditions and that the relatively shallow draft makes them unseaworthy. Their advocates (including Bolger) point to the fact that they are exceptionally good boats for their cost, make excellent day boats and are increasingly seaworthy as (i) the length to beam ratio increases, (ii) they are adequately ballasted and (iii) they are given reserve stability and/or made watertight sufficiently to ensure that they self-right in the event of a capsize. Sharpies may be considered one of the simplest types of boat from the construction point of view. However, their design is controversial and primarily dependent on the intended use.\n\nBolger is particularly known for his \"Square Boats\" (derogatorily known as \"Bolger Boxes\"). Bolger reasoned that a simple rockered bottom and vertical sides gives the most volume, and form stability, on a given beam. After experimenting and studying traditional sharpies and the writings of small-boat historian Howard I. Chapelle and others, he developed the theory that the optimum chine line for a sailing sharpie should represent a regular curve without breaks, changes in radius or straight sections. He further reasoned that the curve of side and bottom should match as much as possible to reduce turbulence. He further reasoned that the sharpie was an ideal shape for a trailer sailer with either leeboards or bilgeboards to provide lateral plane. Bolger felt that the traditional sharpie shape Chapelle had documented based on traditional New England sharpies (with a slightly different chine profile) was inefficient and prone to causing steering difficulties.\n\nBoth designers thought traditional rigs and boat types were suitable for small yachts, especially sailing boats. Generally, Chapelle noted that neither transom nor bow should be immersed when the boat is loaded, a point on which Bolger agreed. Later in his career Phil Bolger and Friends developed modifications to the simple sharpie bow to avoid hull slap at anchor at the expense of a much more complex geometry.\n\nBolger evolved the concept of traditional sharpies and by squaring off the bow and stern to give the longest useful waterline. Most were configured as yawls (with main mast quite far forward and a small mizzen far aft). The bow on these designs is cut off and blunt and the sterns are vertical. In some designe an open bow can allow passage to land if the boat is beached, space for holding anchors and cables, or clearance to step and unstep a mast. \"Oldshoe,\" \"Micro\" and \"Long Micro\" have shallow ballasted full length keels whereas what he called the \"Advanced Sharpies\" \"AS19\", \"AS29\" and \"AS39\" have one or two bilgeboards and inside ballast. The latter are very definitely in the extended cruise/liveaboard category.\n\nBolger championed leeboards as low-tech and practical, to the chagrin of many yachties. The conventional wisdom is that they are ugly. Even many of his centerboard designs had boards that were off-center or all the way to one side or the other (for example, the \"Birdwatcher\" and the \"AS29\"). He concluded that a single leeboard is sufficient in many cases on small boats, and that rigs could be stepped off the centerline without much effect on performance. Bolger advocated leeboards as being a simple means of providing lateral plane to all types of sailing vessel, eliminating many of the disadvantages of centerboards, daggerboards and keels, following broadly in the concepts of L. Francis Herreshoff, various years his senior and, as stated by Bolger, one of the most influential yacht designers from his perspective.\n\nHe used traditional rigs, from the simplest \"Cat rig\" (single sail) through sloops, many yawls and schooners at a time when almost all other designers were concentrating purely on racing rule derived sloops. The diversity of rigs was accompanied by a broad spectrum of sails including the sprit-boomed leg of mutton, the sprit sail, the gaff sail, the lug sail and the lateen in addition to the classic Bermudan/marconi rig. His book '100 Sailing Rigs \"Straight talk\"' later reedited as '103 Sailing Rigs \"Straight talk\"' provides a fascinating look at both rig configurations and sail types as well as his insight into a subject in which he was undoubtedly an expert.\n\nHis experience over the years with well over 600 designs allowed him ample space to experiment with all kinds of designs, rigs and materials. His comments on each subject in books as well as articles published in magazines of the period are based on his research, analysis, first hand experience and use of the different configurations. He is further very clear in explaining the mistakes and corrections he made in each case, and why.\n\nBeginning in November 2002, Bolger and Altenberger began a re-examination of fisheries economics, as a result of the partial collapse of the industry both globally and locally in their hometown of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Their proposal centered on the principle that, in an era of high fuel cost and economic pressure for modernization of depressed fishing ports, sustainable fisheries require a balance of business economics and public planning versus the available fishery resources.\n\nThey argued the key to this was a restructuring of the fishing fleet towards boats with lower complexity, lower initial cost, better fuel economy, and lower operating costs.\n\nLarge expensive complex boats demand taking a high number of fish to be economical. Simpler, lower powered, and lower cost boats can still be economical with lower fish catch rates.\n\nBolger and Altenberger expressed concern that existing governmental fishing permits issued based on length of the fishing boat, created an incentive to use inefficient wide and deep fishing boat hulls. If the fishing permits were issued based instead on displacement tonnage of the hull, then the incentive would be for the fishing industry to use long, narrow and shallow hulls which would be more economical to purchase and to operate per ton of fish caught.\n\nThe existing fishing fleet, composed of ever larger boats with high construction costs, debt loads and operational costs, in the long run forced fishermen to search for ever increasing catch sizes to remain economic while in a fight against regulatory quotas.\n\nBolger and Altenburger argued that, ultimately, fishermen would find it more economically sustainable to do more with less. A consolidated fleet of smaller more economical vessels could make it possible for fishermen to survive with lower catch rates, lower debt load, lower fuel burn, lower insurance rates and lower depreciation.\n\nThis idea was described in the September 2004 issue of the magazine \"National Fisherman\", and again in 2007 as a series of essays published in the magazine \"Messing About in Boats\". The project to build a prototype was authorised but was never developed on any significant commercial scale within Phil Bolger's lifetime.\n\nListed below are a selection of more commonly encountered designs by Phil Bolger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to 1898, it was the capital of colonial Portuguese East Africa. With its rich history and sandy beaches, the Island of Mozambique is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Mozambique's fastest growing tourist destinations. It has a permanent population of approximately 14,000 people and is served by nearby Lumbo Airport on the Nampula mainland.\n\nPottery found on Mozambique Island indicates that the town was founded no later than the fourteenth century. According to tradition, the original Swahili population came from Kilwa. The town's rulers had links with the rulers of both Angoche and Quelimane by the fifteenth century. In 1514, Duarte Barbosa noted that the town had a Muslim population and that they spoke the same Swahili dialect as Angoche. \n\nThe name of the island (, pronounced ) is derived from Ali Musa Mbiki (Mussa Bin Bique), sultan of the island in the times of Vasco da Gama. This name was subsequently taken to the mainland country which is modern-day Mozambique, and the island was renamed \"Ilha de Moçambique\" (Island of Mozambique). The Portuguese established a port and naval base in 1507 and built the Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Baluarte in 1522, now considered the oldest European building in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Fort São Sebastião was built, and the Portuguese settlement (now known as \"Stone Town\") became the capital of Portuguese East Africa. The island also became an important missionary centre. It withstood Dutch attacks in 1607 and 1608 and remained a major post for the Portuguese on their trips to India. It saw the trading of slaves, spices, and gold.\n\nApart from the ancient fortifications, only half of the town is stone-built. The hospital, a majestic neo-classical building constructed in 1877 by the Portuguese, with a garden decorated with ponds and fountains, was repainted white after the Mozambican Civil War. For many years, it was the biggest hospital south of the Sahara.\n\nWith the opening of the Suez Canal, the island's fortunes waned. In 1898, the capital was moved to Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) on the mainland. By the middle of the 20th century, the new harbour of Nacala took most of the remaining business.\n\nOther notable buildings on the island include the Palace and Chapel of São Paulo, built in 1610 as a Jesuit College and subsequently used as the Governor's Residence, now a museum; the Museum of Sacred Art, housed in the Church of the Misericórdia run by the House of Mercy, displaying an excellent Makonde crucifix; the Church of Santo António; the Church of the Misericórdia; and the Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Baluarte. The island, now entirely urbanised, is also home to several mosques and a Hindu temple. A 3 km bridge was erected in the 1960s to connect it to the mainland.\n\nThe island in itself is not very big, about 3 km long and between 200 and 500 metres wide. Most historical buildings are at the island's northern end. The majority of the residents live in reed houses in \"Makuti Town\" at the southern end of the island.\n\nThe island is also close to two tourist highlights: Chocas Mar, a long beach about 40 km north of Ilha de Moçambique across the Mossuril Bay and Cabaceiras.\n\n\n"}

These TVs were marketed as containing all serviceable parts in a drawer beside the picture tube. It was then established as a subsidiary brand, with all Motorola-manufactured televisions being sold as Quasar by Motorola. Motorola sold its television business to Matsushita Electric, now Panasonic, in 1974 who continued producing and marketing televisions under the Quasar brand until 2005. In 2013 Panasonic re-registered the Quasar trademark.\n\nQuasar was established as a television brand in 1967 by Motorola, who wanted to emphasize the simplified design of their all-transistor television sets; the chassis was designed in such a way that the electronic components were contained within a drawer that could be slid out by a technician for easy replacement or repair.\n\nOn May 29, 1974, Motorola, Inc., sold its television manufacturing division—including its plants in Pontiac, Illinois; Franklin Park, Illinois; and Markham, Ontario—to Matsushita. Production of home television receivers continued under a newly incorporated entity, Quasar Electronics, Inc., an American-managed subsidiary of Matsushita Electronic Corporation of America (MECA). Motorola continued to operate a plant in Quincy, Illinois, until 1976, when this also was transferred to Matsushita. In the late 1970s, Quasar Company was established as a sales operation, with Quasar Electronics, Inc., manufacturing both televisions and microwave ovens in Franklin Park, Illinois. In 1981, improved production operations at this plant were praised by the media and management specialists, and quality control employees noted that they rarely were required to repair manufacturing defects, which had been a problem previously. The Franklin Park plant and Matushita's management and manufacturing processes were discussed in \"Theory Z\", a book by University of California Los Angeles management professor William Ouchi.\n\nQuasar Electronics, Inc. and Quasar Company ceased to exist in 2004. As of 2005, the Quasar name was little used in North America, typically affixed to a few discontinued products from the Panasonic line being offered as value products in drug stores and supermarkets. The trademark expired in 2007, by which time it was only being used on window air conditioners. In 2013 Panasonic re-registered the Quasar trademark to be used on a wide variety of electronics.\n\nAccording to a 1992 episode of the PBS news program \"Frontline\", entitled \"Coming From Japan\", Matsushita's acquisition of Motorola's Consumer Division was the beginning of the downfall of the US TV industry. \"Frontline\" stated that Matsushita's acquisition was a ruse intended to allow Japanese-made sets, and sets assembled of Japanese parts, to avoid tariffs, with products under the Quasar brand still considered \"domestically made\", although Quasar's US-based engineering, management and manufacturing division was slowly being liquidated. Some of the American management who transitioned to Matsushita's Quasar after the acquisition said that they were laid off en masse; they filed a discrimination lawsuit afterwards. The lawsuit was initially victorious, but overturned on appeal in 1991 when the Seventh Circuit Federal Appeals Court ruled that Matsushita's decision to treat executives differently based on citizenship rather than national origin was not legally discrimination.\n\n"}
{"id": "2214847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214847", "title": "Geometry processing", "text": "Geometry processing\n\nGeometry processing, or mesh processing, is an area of research that uses concepts from applied mathematics, computer science and engineering to design efficient algorithms for the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, manipulation, simulation and transmission of complex 3D models. As the name implies, many of the concepts, data structures, and algorithms are directly analogous to signal processing and image processing. For example, where image smoothing might convolve an intensity signal with a blur kernel formed using the Laplace operator, geometric smoothing might be achieved by convolving a surface geometry with a blur kernel formed using the Laplace-Beltrami operator.\n\nApplications of geometry processing algorithms already cover a wide range of areas from multimedia, entertainment and classical computer-aided design, to biomedical computing, reverse engineering, and scientific computing.\n\nGeometry processing is a common research topic at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics academic conference, and the main topic of the annual Symposium on Geometry Processing.\n\nGeometry processing involves working with a shape, usually in 2D or 3D, although the shape can live in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The processing of a shape involves three stages, which is known as its life cycle. At its \"birth,\" a shape can be instantiated through one of three methods: a model, a mathematical representation, or a scan. After a shape is born, it can be analyzed and edited repeatedly in a cycle. This usually involves acquiring different measurements, such as the distances between the points of the shape, the smoothness of the shape, or its Euler characteristic. Editing may involve denoising, deforming, or performing rigid transformations. At the final stage of the shape's \"life,\" it is consumed. This can mean it is consumed by a viewer as a rendered asset in a game or movie, for instance. The end of a shape's life can also be defined by a decision about the shape, like whether or not it satisfies some criteria. Or it can even be fabricated in the real world, through a method such as 3D printing or laser cutting.\n\nLike any other shape, the shapes used in geometry processing have properties pertaining to their geometry and topology. The geometry of a shape concerns the position of the shape's points in space, tangents, normals, and curvature. It also includes the dimension in which the shape lives (ex. formula_1 or formula_2). The topology of a shape is a collection of properties that do not change even after smooth transformations have been applied to the shape. It concerns dimensions such as the number of holes and boundaries, as well as the orientability of the shape. One example of a non-orientable shape is the Mobius strip.\n\nIn computers, everything must be discretized. Shapes in geometry processing are usually represented as triangle meshes, which can be seen as a graph. Each node in the graph is a vertex (usually in formula_2), which has a position. This encodes the geometry of the shape. Directed edges connect these vertices into triangles, which by the right hand rule, then have a direction called the normal. Each triangle forms a face of the mesh. These are combinatoric in nature and encode the topology of the shape. In addition to triangles, a more general class of polygon meshes can also be used to represent a shape. More advanced representations like progressive meshes encode a coarse representation along with a sequence of transformations, which produce a fine or high resolution representation of the shape once applied. These meshes are useful in a variety of applications, including geomorphs, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement.\nOne particularly important property of a 3D shape is its Euler characteristic, which can alternatively be defined in terms of its genus. The formula for this in the continuous sense is formula_4, where formula_5 is the number of connected components, formula_6 is number of holes (as in donut holes, see torus), and formula_7 is the number of connected components of the boundary of the surface. A concrete example of this is a mesh of a pair of pants. There is one connected component, 0 holes, and 3 connected components of the boundary (the waist and two leg holes). So in this case, the Euler characteristic is -1. To bring this into the discrete world, the Euler characteristic of a mesh is computed in terms of its vertices, edges, and faces. formula_8.\n\nDepending on how a shape is initialized or \"birthed,\" the shape might exist only as a nebula of sampled points that represent its surface in space. To transform the surface points into a mesh, the Poisson reconstruction strategy can be employed. This method states that the indicator function, a function that determines which points in space belong to the surface of the shape, can actually be computed from the sampled points. The key concept is that gradient of the indicator function is \"0\" everywhere, except at the sampled points, where it is equal to the inward surface normal. More formally, suppose the collection of sampled points from the surface is denoted by formula_9, each point in the space by formula_10, and the corresponding normal at that point by formula_11. Then the gradient of the indicator function is defined as:\n\nformula_12\n\nThe task of reconstruction then becomes a variational problem. To find the indicator function of the surface, we must find a function formula_13 such that formula_14 is minimized, where formula_15 is the vector field defined by the samples. As a variational problem, one can view the minimizer formula_16as a solution of Poisson's equation. After obtaining a good approximation for formula_16 and a value formula_18 for which the points formula_19 with formula_20 lie on the surface to be reconstructed, the marching cubes algorithm can be used to construct a triangle mesh from the function formula_16 , which can then be applied in subsequent computer graphics applications.\n\nOne common problem encountered in geometry processing is how to merge multiple views of a single object captured from different angles or positions. This problem is known as registration. In registration, we wish to find an optimal rigid transformation that will align surface formula_22 with surface formula_23. More formally, if formula_24 is the projection of a point \"x\" from surface formula_22 onto surface formula_23, we want to find the optimal rotation matrix formula_27 and translation vector formula_28 that minimize the following objective function:\n\nformula_29\n\nWhile rotations are non-linear in general, small rotations can be linearized as skew-symmetric matrices. Moreover, the distance function formula_30 is non-linear, but is amenable to linear approximations if the change in formula_22 is small. An iterative solution such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is therefore employed to solve for small transformations iteratively, instead of solving for the potentially large transformation in one go. In ICP, \"n\" random sample points from formula_22 are chosen and projected onto formula_23. In order to sample points uniformly at random across the surface of the triangle mesh, the random sampling is broken into two stages: uniformly sampling points within a triangle; and non-uniformly sampling triangles, such that each triangle's associated probability is proportional to its surface area. Thereafter, the optimal transformation is calculated based on the difference between each formula_34 and its projection. In the following iteration, the projections are calculated based on the result of applying the previous transformation on the samples. The process is repeated until convergence.\n\nWhen shapes are defined or scanned, there may be accompanying noise, either to a signal acting upon the surface or to the actual surface geometry. Reducing noise on the former is known as data denoising, while noise reduction on the latter is known as surface fairing. The task of geometric smoothing is analogous to signal noise reduction, and consequently employs similar approaches.\n\nThe pertinent Lagrangian to be minimized is derived by recording the conformity to the initial signal formula_35 and the smoothness of the resulting signal, which approximated by the magnitude of the gradient with a weight formula_36:\n\nformula_37.\n\nTaking a variation formula_38 on formula_39 emits the necessary condition\n\nformula_40.\n\nBy discretizing this onto piecewise-constant elements with our signal on the vertices we obtain\n\nformula_41where our choice of formula_42 is chosen to be formula_43 for the cotangent Laplacian formula_44 and the formula_45 term is to map the image of the Laplacian from areas to points. Because the variation is free, this results in a self-adjoint linear problem to solve with a parameter formula_36: formula_47 When working with triangle meshes one way to determine the values of the Laplacian matrix formula_48 is through analyzing the geometry of connected triangles on the mesh.\n\nformula_49\n\nWhere formula_50 and formula_51 are the angles opposite the edge formula_52\nThe mass matrix M as an operator computes the local integral of a function's value and is often set for a mesh with m triangles as follows:\n\nformula_53\n\nOccasionally, we need to flatten a 3D surface onto a flat plane. This process is known as parameterization. The goal is to find coordinates \"u\" and \"v\" onto which we can map the surface so that distortions are minimized. In this manner, parameterization can be seen as an optimization problem. One of the major applications of mesh parameterization is texture mapping.\n\nOne way to measure the distortion accrued in the mapping process is to measure how much the length of the edges on the 2D mapping differs from their lengths in the original 3D surface. In more formal terms, the objective function can be written as:\n\nformula_54\n\nWhere formula_55 is the set of mesh edges and formula_56 is the set of vertices. However, optimizing this objective function would result in a solution that maps all of the vertices to a single vertex in the \"uv\"-coordinates. Borrowing an idea from graph theory, we apply the Tutte Mapping and restrict the boundary vertices of the mesh onto a unit circle or other convex polygon. Doing so prevents the vertices from collapsing into a single vertex when the mapping is applied. The non-boundary vertices are then positioned at the barycentric interpolation of their neighbours. The Tutte Mapping, however, still suffers from severe distortions as it attempts to make the edge lengths equal, and hence does not correctly account for the triangle sizes on the actual surface mesh.\n\nAnother way to measure the distortion is to consider the variations on the \"u\" and \"v\" coordinate functions. The wobbliness and distortion apparent in the mass springs methods are due to high variations in the \"u\" and \"v\" coordinate functions. With this approach, the objective function becomes the Dirichlet energy on \"u\" and \"v:\"\n\nformula_57\n\nThere are a few other things to consider. We would like to minimize the angle distortion to preserve orthogonality. That means we would like formula_58. In addition, we would also like the mapping to have proportionally similar sized regions as the original. This results to setting the Jacobian of the \"u\" and \"v\" coordinate functions to 1.\n\nformula_59\n\nPutting these requirements together, we can augment the Dirichlet energy so that our objective function becomes:\n\nformula_60\n\nTo avoid the problem of having all the vertices mapped to a single point, we also require that the solution to the optimization problem must have a non-zero norm and that it is orthogonal to the trivial solution.\n\nDeformation is concerned with transforming some rest shape to a new shape. Typically, these transformations are continuous and do not alter the topology of the shape. Modern mesh-based shape deformation methods satisfy user deformation constraints at handles (selected vertices or regions on the mesh) and propagate these handle deformations to the rest of shape smoothly and without removing or distorting details. Some common forms of interactive deformations are point-based, skeleton-based, and cage-based. In point-based deformation, a user can apply transformations to small set of points, called handles, on the shape. Skeleton-based deformation defines a skeleton for the shape, which allows a user to move the bones and rotate the joints. Cage-based deformation requires a cage to be drawn around all or part of a shape so that, when the user manipulates points on the cage, the volume it encloses changes accordingly.\n\nHandles provide a sparse set of constraints for the deformation: as the user moves one point, the others must stay in place.\n\nA rest surface formula_61 immersed in formula_62 can be described with a mapping formula_63, where formula_64 is a 2D parametric domain. The same can be done with another mapping formula_34 for the transformed surface formula_9. Ideally, the transformed shape adds as little distortion as possible to the original. One way to model this distortion is in terms of displacements formula_67 with a Laplacian-based energy. Applying the Laplace operator to these mappings allows us to measure how the position of a point changes relative to its neighborhood, which keeps the handles smooth. Thus, the energy we would like to minimize can be written as:\n\nformula_68.\n\nWhile this method is translation invariant, it is unable to account for rotations. The As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation scheme applies a rigid transformation formula_69 to each handle i, where formula_70 is a rotation matrix and formula_71 is a translation vector. Unfortunately, there's no way to know the rotations in advance, so instead we pick a “best” rotation that minimizes displacements. To achieve local rotation invariance, however, requires a function formula_72 which outputs the best rotation for every point on the surface. The resulting energy, then, must optimize over both formula_73 and formula_74:\n\nformula_75\n\nNote that the translation vector is not present in the final objective function because translations have constant gradient.\n\nWhile seemingly trivial, in many cases, determining the inside from the outside of a triangle mesh is not an easy problem. In general, given a surface formula_9 we pose this problem as determining a function formula_77 which will return formula_78 if the point formula_79 is inside formula_9, and formula_81 otherwise.\n\nIn the simplest case, the shape is closed. In this case, to determine if a point formula_79 is inside or outside the surface, we can cast a ray formula_83 in any direction from a query point, and count the number of times formula_84 it passes through the surface. If formula_79 was outside formula_9 then the ray must either not pass through formula_9 (in which case formula_88) or, each time it enters formula_9 it must pass through twice, because S is bounded, so any ray entering it must exit. So if formula_79 is outside, formula_84 is even. Likewise if formula_79 is inside, the same logic applies to the previous case, but the ray must intersect formula_9 one extra time for the first time it leaves formula_9. So:\n\nformula_95\n\nNow, oftentimes we cannot guarantee that the formula_9 is closed. Take the pair of pants example from the top of this article. This mesh clearly has a semantic inside-and-outside, despite there being holes at the waist and the legs.\n\nThe naive attempt to solve this problem is to shoot many rays in random directions, and classify formula_79 as being inside if and only if most of the rays intersected formula_9 an odd number of times. To quantify this, let us say we cast formula_99 rays, formula_100. We associate a number formula_101 which is the average value of formula_102 from each ray. Therefore:\n\nformula_103\n\nIn the limit of shooting many, many rays, this method handles open meshes, however it in order to become accurate, far too many rays are required for this method to be computationally ideal. Instead, a more robust approach is the Generalized Winding Number. Inspired by the 2D winding number, this approach uses the solid angle at formula_79 of each triangle in the mesh to determine if formula_79 is inside or outside. The value of the Generalized Winding Number at formula_79, formula_107 is proportional to the sum of the solid angle contribution from each triangle in the mesh:\n\nformula_108\n\nFor a closed mesh, formula_107 is equivalent to the characteristic function for the volume represented by formula_9. Therefore, we say:\n\nformula_111\n\nBecause formula_107 is a harmonic function, it degrades gracefully, meaning the inside-outside segmentation would not change much if we poked holes in a closed mesh. For this reason, the Generalized Winding Number handles open meshes robustly. The boundary between inside and outside smoothly passes over holes in the mesh. In fact, in the limit, the Generalized Winding Number is equivalent to the ray-casting method as the number of rays goes to infinity.\n\n\n\n"}

The Football Association introduced their Football Association Challenge Cup (now better known as the FA Cup), a knockout tournament which is the world's oldest national-level football competition.\n\nThe competition began on 11 November 1871 when four matches were played. Fifteen clubs had entered but three of those withdrew so there were just twelve actual participants. They included the leading Scottish club, Queen's Park of Glasgow who reached the semi-final in which they drew 0–0 with the eventual winners Wanderers. A replay was required but Queen's Park could not afford the travel costs and withdrew. The other semi-final between Royal Engineers and the original Crystal Palace was also drawn and the Engineers won the replay 3–0. The first-ever final was won by Wanderers who defeated Royal Engineers 1–0 at Kennington Oval in south London. The goal was scored by Morton Betts after 15 minutes' play. Under the original rules of the competition, Wanderers automatically qualified for the next season's final to defend their trophy.\n\nDuring the course of the season, two matches between teams representing England and Scotland were played at the Kennington Oval. The first was on 18 November 1871 and England won 2–1 with both goals scored by Robert Walker in the first half. Scotland's scorer, near the end of the match, was Henry Renny-Tailyour. The second match was on 24 February 1872 and England won 1–0 with a goal by Charlie Clegg midway through the first half. The crowd was less than a thousand.\n\nThese matches are no longer recognised as full internationals because the Scotland team consisted entirely of Anglo-Scots based in the London area, so there were no Scottish residents or players from Scottish clubs. Nevertheless, the games were the forerunners of international football which began the following season when the first official match was played in Glasgow on 30 November 1872.\n"}

The laser was a 100 kilowatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL). It was expected to have a tactical range of approximately twenty kilometers and weigh about 5,000–7,000 kg. This program is distinct from the Airborne Laser, which was a much larger system designed to destroy enemy missiles in the boost phase.\n\nIn 1996, the blue-beam air-to-ground tactical laser was test-fired from an AC-130 (AC-X Son of Spectre) aircraft at the northern annex of the White Sands Proving Grounds near Fort Wingate, New Mexico. Raytheon was later awarded the contract to add the High Energy Microwave Weapon to the same platform where both systems would be operationally available for combat use at the same time. \n\nIn 2002, the Special Operations Command entered into a contract with the Boeing Company, specifically the Lasers and Electro-Optics Systems division in West Hills, CA, to produce a prototype laser system on a test aircraft. This effort was heavily supported by Boeing-SVS Inc. in Albuquerque, NM.\n\nOn January 18, 2006, the U.S. Air Force's 46th Test Wing handed over to Boeing a C-130H Hercules transport aircraft for use in the ATL program. Both the laser and the aircraft have undergone testing in the summer of 2006 culminating in the systems joint combined tests in 2007 with full-scale development afterward.\n\nBoeing announced that on December 4, 2007 the installation of the laser on the C-130H Hercules was completed in preparation for further testing and a demonstration in 2008.\n\nThere has been some fear that an airborne laser system could be used to attack targets which would usually be considered 'off-limits', due to the weapon's 'plausible deniability'. Since no such weapon has ever been observed before, its effects would be hard to identify, meaning that there would rarely be conclusive proof of a laser strike. On August 13, 2008 Boeing announced the first test firing of the \"high-energy chemical laser\" mounted in a Hercules transport plane. The test firing was controlled via the ATL beam control system, which acquired a ground target and fired as \"directed by ATL's battle management system.\" The ATL weighs 12,000 pounds. Boeing said that the laser hit a 3 by 3 foot target at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.\n\nAccording to a November 5, 2008 article there was a recent Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report stating \"the Advanced Tactical Laser testbed has no operational utility.\" That does not mean it's not necessarily a good idea, but that it may need further development. The Air Force Research Laboratory continues to run tests and develop the platform. There is some discussion of converting to solid state lasers from the existing chemical lasers. Being much smaller and lighter, solid state lasers might be deployable on smaller platforms. The existing chemical laser platform is being used to develop more advanced control software and hardware and to reduce problems such as \"jitter\".\n\nOn June 18, 2009 it was announced that the ATL was successfully fired in flight for the first time. The system was fired from a 46th Test Wing NC-130H aircraft while flying over White Sands Missile Range, successfully hitting a target board on the ground.\n\nAug. 30, 2009 Boeing and the U.S. Air Force \"defeated\" a ground target from the air with the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) aircraft.\n\nThe advanced tactical laser was discontinued after successful testing.\n\n\n"}

It begins in far northern DeKalb County, just north of Chamblee, and flows southwestward into Fulton County, through the far southeast corner of Sandy Springs, then through the Buckhead area of Atlanta. It empties into Peachtree Creek, which then flows into the Chattahoochee River, south of Vinings and Paces. The Chattahoochee eventually joins with the Flint River to create the Apalachicola River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The North Fork Nancy Creek is a major tributary, while Little Nancy Creek tends to run low or dry. Other tributaries include Bubbling Creek which originates in Chamblee, Perimeter Creek which originates in Dunwoody and Silver Creek which includes the 38-acre Silver Lake and Little Silver Lake.\n\nSince 1994, Nancy Creek has had a USGS stream gauge in the Paces neighborhood of Atlanta at West Wesley Road (\"NANG1\", ), with NWS flood stage being at that point. The drainage basin above it is . Since 2003, there is another gauge further upstream in Buckhead at Rickenbacker Drive (\"NCKG1\", ). The basin at that point is , above an elevation of , with a flood stage of . Records of manual observations actually go back to 1961 at both sites (which are considered to be \"at Atlanta\"), but the latter gauge (often called \"at Buckhead\" to avoid ambiguity) appears to be the officially-used one.\n\nEspecially due to excessive urbanization, Nancy Creek often floods. Prior to September 2009, the most recent was in July 2005, with it reaching after the outer rain bands of Hurricane Dennis passed by. This was just after Hurricane Cindy caused it to flood as well, though neither event was considered major.\n\nHurricane Ivan and Hurricane Frances caused record-high floods less than a year earlier in September 2004. Those massive rains caused a sewer pipe to collapse into the creek due to major erosion, spilling sewage into the creek. The creek reached late on September 16, its second-highest ever. While this only lasted a few hours, several residents had to be rescued and evacuated by boat.\n\nSome of the worst flooding ever recorded on Nancy Creek occurred in September 2009 as a result of the 2009 Atlanta floods. It severely damaged the bridge at Peachtree Dunwoody Road, washing out the main center support beam. The bridge was closed for six months until an entirely new two-lane replacement bridge reopened on March 23, 2010. The Emergency Repair Program of the Federal Highway Administration funded 100% of the $1 million cost.\n\nOn the evening of September 21, the creek reached at Rickenbacker Drive, where it began to overflow the bridge. This falls in fourth place, behind the 1973 record of set on December 1. It also reached at West Wesley Road, in second place behind the 2004 flood, when it reached on September 17.\n\n\nThe best times of day and year for fishing in these areas are late spring to mid-fall in the afternoon to evening. During the winter, the fish of Nancy Creek are significantly less active due to the great drop in temperature of the water. Popular techniques for fishing in Nancy Creek include fly fishing, as well as fishing with a spinning outfit.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Nancy Creek\" is unclear. The name most likely honors a Native American Indian woman named Nancy.\n\n"}

He is currently managing Anderlecht.\n\nVercauteren made his first team debut for Anderlecht in 1975 against Racing Mechelen, replacing Gilbert Van Binst. A double surgery in October 1975 and January 1976, however, later slowed down his development. Vercauteren won the five European titles with Anderlecht (two European Cup Winners' Cups, one UEFA Cup and two European Supercups). He also won two Belgian Cups, four Belgian Championship titles and won the Belgian Supercup twice. In 1987, he joined Nantes in France and came back to Belgium three years later to play with Molenbeek until 1993. While at Nantes, Vercauteren finished twice the championship with the most assists.\n\nVercauteren played 63 times with the Belgium national team. He was part of the squad that finished fourth at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and also featured in the 1982 World Cup and at UEFA Euro 1984. Though he made his national team debut on 16 November 1977 (a 3–0 defeat to Northern Ireland national football team), he was not selected for the Euro 1980, where Belgium finished runner-up to West Germany.\n\nAt the end of his playing career, Vercauteren became the trainer of the youth team from C.S. Braine, a small club in Walloon Brabant. A year after, he moved to KV Mechelen, where he first trained the youth team, then the first team, beginning in 1997–98. At the end of this season, he signed as an assistant manager at his first club as a player, Anderlecht. He was briefly named manager along with his fellow Jean Dockx in the 1998–99 season after a disappointing start by manager Arie Haan (Anderlecht fell to the 18th and last place in the beginning of the season). The two men secured among others a nice 0–6 win at Sclessin against old rival Standard Liège and a 2–5 win at Genk, to come back in the European places.\n\nAnderlecht then hired Aimé Anthuenis as a manager, and Vercauteren became assistant once again. After coach Hugo Broos (the successor of Anthuenis) was dismissed in February 2005, Vercauteren signed as the new manager and won twice the Belgian Championship. On 12 November 2007, after a string of poor and indifferent results, Vercauteren and Anderlecht parted company, with assistant coach Ariel Jacobs taking over until the end of the season.\n\nFrom 9 April 2009 to 10 September 2009, Vercauteren served as caretaker manager for the Belgium national team, resigning after Belgium's defeat to Armenia on 9 September 2009; he was replaced by the Dutchman Dick Advocaat. On 3 December 2009, Vercauteren signed a contract as head coach for Genk. On 17 May 2011, he celebrated winning the 2010–11 Belgian Pro League championship with Genk after a 1–1 home draw against Standard Liège. He also won the 2011 Belgian Super Cup over Standard, and led his club into the qualifying play-off for the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League.\n\nOn 8 August 2011, Vercauteren signed a contract as head coach of Emirati side Al Jazira Club. On 11 March 2012, Al Jazira announced that they had parted company with Vercauteren. They stated the reason behind the controversial exit of Vercauteren was because he was not getting on with the players.

Records.\n\n\"Parade\" eschews the guitar and rock elements of Prince's 1984 album \"Purple Rain\" in favor of the psychedelic pop style he explored on \"Around the World in a Day\" (1985), austerely produced funk, and soundtrack compositions. After the critical disappointment of his 1985 album \"Around the World in a Day\", \"Parade\" was released to acclaim from music critics. \"Kiss\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Parade\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in June 1986.\n\n\"Parade\" was named one of the best albums of 1986 by \"The Village Voice\" and \"NME\" magazine, who named it their Album of the Year.\n\n\"Parade\" was the follow-up to \"Around the World in a Day\" and the soundtrack to Prince's second film. The album sees Prince further diversifying musically, adding orchestrations to his music and presenting a very European feel. Prince also displayed a new image with \"Parade\": his trademark ruffled shirts, wild curly hair, and purple outfits, which defined his look from 1981's \"Controversy\" to 1985's \"Around the World in a Day\", were replaced by slicked-back hair and dress suits. The first single, \"Kiss\", was a number one hit, and the album as a whole was well received in the United States. Europe further embraced the album, and for the first time in Prince's career European album sales eclipsed those in the United States. While \"Parade\" was the last official release with The Revolution, a follow up called \"Dream Factory\" was recorded. Its release was canceled when Prince disbanded the group.\n\n\"Parade\" eschews the guitar and rock elements of Prince's 1984 album \"Purple Rain\" in favor of the neo-psychedelic style he explored on \"Around the World in a Day\" (1985), austerely produced funk, and soundtrack compositions. According to \"Blender\" magazine's Keith Harris, \"Parade\" \"makes a pop cavalcade out of the same psychedelic affectations\" of \"Around the World in a Day\". Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" viewed it as a modern \"fusion of \"Fresh\"s foundation and \"Sgt. Pepper\"s filigrees\", with songs he described as baroque pop creations. According to PopMatters editor Quentin B. Huff, \"\"Parade\" doesn't sound like anything else in the Prince canon. The album is a blend of jazz, soul, and a certain French undercurrent, probably absorbed from the film being set in France.\"\n\n\"Parade\" is bookended by two songs—\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\" and \"Sometimes It Snows in April\"—that reference Christopher Tracy, the protagonist from \"Under the Cherry Moon\". The latter song is an acoustic ballad with chromatic choruses and sentimental lyrics bidding farewell to Tracy. Christgau wrote that the album's lyrics suggest that Prince sings as Tracy, although he cannot be certain. \"Parade\" also features some French lyrics and \"chanson\" arrangements, which refer to the film's French setting.\n\n\"Parade\" was released on March 31, 1986 to acclaim from music critics, who viewed it as a creative comeback after the critical disappointment of \"Around the World in a Day\". In a contemporary review for \"The New York Times\", John Rockwell said that the album succeeds in part because of the more aggressive songs, \"in which Prince chooses to play up the black side of his multifaceted musical sensibility.\" \"The Sunday Times\" found its musical scope \"stunning\", and the \"Detroit Free Press\" called the album \"a confirmation of Prince's place as a superior melodist, arranger, and player, as well as a celebration of his creativity.\" \"Hi-Fi News & Record Review\" called songs such as \"New Position and \"Girls and Boys\" well-crafted funk and said that \"when Prince opts to go completely daft, as he does on 'Do U Lie'... even then the result is somehow endearing and instantly likeable.\"\n\nCommercially, \"Parade\" charted at number 3 on the pop chart and at number 2 on the R&B chart, while selling 2 million copies in the United States, where Prince's sales had decreased. However it garnered him a new commercial audience in Europe and sold 2 million copies internationally. The album finished 25th in the voting for \"The Village Voice\"s annual Pazz & Jop critics poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it as the 33rd best album of the year on his own list. \"NME\" magazine named it their album of the year for 1986.\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine viewed \"Parade\" as a musically diverse near-masterpiece that is given depth by Prince's \"weird religious and sexual metaphors\". Simon Price later wrote in \"The Guardian\" that it was \"the sound of Prince at his most effortless and assured. Cohesive and ice cream-cool, nobody would guess it was a soundtrack for a (sub-par) film. And it has 'Kiss' on it.\" In a less enthusiastic review for \"Entertainment Weekly\", David Browne said the record's ornate ballads and inconsistent material made it more self-indulgent than \"Around the World in a Day\". According to Mosi Reeves of Rhapsody, Prince's die-hard fans viewed the album as a charming mix of funk, jazz, and pop rock styles, but some detractors felt that its music was overblown. Reeves himself said that \"this stylistic departure is an anomaly\". In rapper Chuck D's opinion, Prince \"turned off a lot of the black followers [with the album]. I couldn't understand that. People don't want artists to endlessly repeat themselves, yet they can't tolerate change either. Prince changes all the time, always working on the public's imagination, always trying to keep ahead of them.\"\n\n\n"}

Simply, the term describes a consistency of internal plot, and usually of characterisation and external references also. Initially, many comics were stand alone, \"done in one\" stories with a beginning and end taking place within the confines of a single comic issue, often structured in chapters as are most novels. Over time, the comics companies realised the lucrative potential of the crossover comic, whereby other characters from a company's shared universe appeared in issues of each other's comics. (This ultimately led to the formation of \"team\" books such as the \"Justice Society of America\", \"Justice League of America\" and \"Avengers\".)\n\nDuring these crossover character interactions, editorial footnotes would often reference previous adventures and comics issues, but an actual editorially enforced \"continuity\" was not strictly adhered to, leading to some characters' actions appearing \"out of character,\" or outrightly contradicting earlier plot-points. As comics were deemed largely ephemeral items, this was not considered that much of a problem, until the full advent of comics fandom. As a result of fan/reader scrutiny, the continuity both of individual characters and of the wider universes in which comics companies' characters interacted began to become more important. The Marvel \"No Prize\" became a humorous method by which readers could write letters to authors and editors pointing out mistakes or \"continuity errors\" in various comics, and were then named in print and awarded a \"No Prize\" (in reality a coveted sheet of paper declaring itself a non prize).\n\nIn 1985, cross-universe continuity took on new levels of depth and (intended) consistency at the two main comics companies: DC and Marvel. Marvel launched its cross-line toy-driven-event \"Secret Wars\", which required all characters to undergo specific changes at specific times, and required considerable editorial dictates and conformity. DC launched the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", one of the earliest maxi-series', to address universe-wide continuity and attempt to explain away, remove or revise all previous errors in continuity. The reader was reminded that the DC Multiverse consisted not merely of the core DC Universe, but of a number of different iterations of various heroes on a multitude of different planets. Companies and characters purchased by DC (such as the Charlton Comics characters and Captain Marvel) as well as older characters like the JSA were (re-)assigned their own Earths, which were then destroyed and folded into one, core Earth. This naturally resulted in a number of contradictions and discrepancies in individual characters' histories, so a new, uniform continuity was created and the revised origins of the resulting heroes were retold in the hopes of maintaining consistent continuity.\n\nNaturally with hundreds of characters and dozens of writers, over the years uniform and consistent continuity is difficult to maintain, and most comics companies periodically address the erosion of internal consistency with big \"events\" designed to explain and simplify (although at times they do neither) discrepancies, and maintain continuity.\n\nSimilar to internal continuity, the canon of comics characters/universes is often subject to change, but refers to the stories which are, at any one point, part of the \"official\", \"accepted\" history and story of particular characters/universes. Alternate versions of characters (such as DC's Elseworlds and Marvel's speculative \"What if...?\" titles) are necessarily \"not\" canon. However, stories can change from being non-canonical to being accepted as canon - and vice versa. In particular, line-wide continuity-changing events (such as DC's \"Crises\" and Marvel's controversial recent \"\" storyline) retroactively affect which stories are part of a character/universe's core canon, as they may revise or ignore previous events and happenings.\n\nFor example, DC's \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" addressed continuity and consistency errors over almost 50 years of comics publication, and retrofitted events and characters into the history of the DCU as if they had always been there. (For example, the JSA went from being JLA-contemporaries from a parallel world to being their earlier, historical counterparts some years previously.) The Post-Crisis DC Universe removed many stories from \"official canon\", explaining them as Imaginary Tales or ignoring them completely.\n\nRetcon or \"Ret-con\" is a portmanteau shorthand phrase for \"retroactive continuity\", and is the descriptive term used to explain continuity- and canon-effecting stories. A retcon affects the past history of characters and/or the whole shared universe, and says that the \"new\" changed events \"have always been that way\". This can lead to intense confusion, as compounded events can cause even the most knowledgeable fan to falter over what is currently the accepted canon.\n\nLinked: retrofit, retroactively embedding something (usually a plot point or subsidiary character) into a past story, for the purposes of a current story. This can give added weight to a story, implying that the impetus for a current story had been around for some time. ex. The limited series from 2006 \"retrofit\" the story line from 1975's Giant-Size X-Men#1 to include new characters and plot points. It can also be used to update a character for more modern times. For instance, Iron Man #1 (Vol. 4) updated Iron Man's origin story so that he was wounded in Afghanistan instead of Vietnam.\n\nLabels referring to DC Universe continuity and canon, with the separator being the 1985 ret-con event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Simply, Pre-\"Crisis\" stories were not as stringently policed or edited, and often contained errors and internal inaccuracies (in large part because of their frequent nature as one-shot stories, rather than linked tales designed to follow evolving and changing characters). Pre-\"Crisis\" stories are often seen as throwaway and frivolous, perceived to be dominated by imaginary tales and \"camp\" characterisation. Neither label is entirely accurate, nor is the broad-brush assumption that a lack of cohesive continuity denotes a complete disregard for it.\n\nThe Post-\"Crisis\" DCU is that which was formed in the pages of the \"CoIE\" maxi-series, and is (or was intended to be) far more internally consistent and interlinked. Characters' origins were revised and updated, conflating previous stories and origins into one, accepted canonical one. Writer-artist John Byrne's \"\" mini-series, for example, provided the post-\"Crisis\" origin of Kal El, while \"Crisis\"-architects Marv Wolfman and George Pérez produced the two-issue History of the DC Universe to briefly detail a broad overview of the post-\"Crisis\" DCU, showing the sequence of events as well as the revised origins of many characters (later to be fleshed out in their own series).\n\nEven the post-\"Crisis\" DCU was not without its continuity problems, however, and several subsequent events have attempted to address them, making the \"post-\"Crisis\"\" label largely defunct. However, because of the 1985 maxi-series's landmark status, the label persists in one form or another.\n\nAll these terms refer to specific and general \"non-canonical stories\", often – but not exclusively – featuring alternate versions of established heroes, events, or both. For many years some DC comics would feature stories labelled as \"Imaginary Tales\", signifying that the events which occurred therein did not have an active effect on continuity, and therefore that anything could happen, even the bizarre and contradictory. DC transitioned to the Elseworlds imprint, whereas Marvel created the \"What If...?\" series.\n\nA character's \"origin\" is the fictional story which describes (almost always solely for Superheroes) how they came to be; gained their powers; arrived on Earth; were bitten by a radioactive spider, etc. Origins need not be established immediately, they can be told in flashback, or slowly over the course of several issues or, indeed, years. Origins are often subject to revision and ret-cons, and may find themselves having additional information retrofitted in at a later time.\n\nThey are also frequently updated to better reflect their times. For example, the origin of Iron Man has gradually been revised and updated, so that instead of serving in the Vietnam War, he serves in Korea or the (first) Gulf War.\n\nA comics \"event\" describes a large storyline which almost-always involves a crossover between one or more characters, titles, universes or companies, but usually denotes an internal company crossover. These then typically fall into two broad categories: character or universe events. i.e. a Batman \"event\" will likely only feature the Batman family of characters (an example would be the \"\" storylines), while a multi-character crossover will usually be universe-wide and affect several different individuals (an example would be Marvel's Civil War event, which affected almost-every character and title in their shared universe).\n\nCross-Universe events and inter-company events are considerably rarer, but do happen. 1996's DC vs. Marvel event saw the DCU and MU brought together (and ultimately, briefly, merged), while the DC Universe has also featured in events/crossovers with, for example, the WildStorm and Milestone universes.\n\nThe concept of a shared universe is one in which a multitude of different characters co-exist and/or interact. Typically this concept confines itself to one publishing company's output (although concepts such as the Wold Newton family extend the boundaries considerably), and it is most common in the main superhero universes of DC and Marvel. The benefit of having a shared universe is that characters can make (sales-boosting) guest appearances and allow for team-ups between different characters, as well as allowing the \"team\" concept (JLA, Avengers, etc.) to exist at all. Stan Lee's initial Marvel Universe creations in the 1960s best exemplify the \"shared universe\" concept, whereby characters (and villains) would feature across multiple titles, sometimes in the foreground of the story, sometimes as cameos in passing, but always underlining the interlinkedness of the universe.\n\nThe concept of a shared universe, wherein a company's diverse cast of characters are able to interact and crossover between books and events is usually labelled the \" - Universe\" (DC, Marvel, Image, CrossGen, Valiant, etc.). Comics fandom has produced various shorthand ways of referring to the various universes, however, and the comics themselves also refer to themselves in specific ways. These labels are usually reserved for the universes of \"the Big Two\" (Marvel and DC), in large part because they are the main American comics publishers and have the largest shared universes. A non-exhaustive list of terms includes:\n\nThe Marvel Universe, sometimes abbreviated to MU, is the shared universe in which the X-Men, Spider-Man and Avengers, etc. all exist and interact.\n\n\nThe DC Universe, or DCU, refers to the shared universe inhabited by Batman, Superman, the Justice League of America, etc.\n\n\nDisney's \"Uncle Scrooge\" and associated titles take place inside the Duck universe, a fan appellation.\n\nIn addition to the core shared universe, some companies have subsidiary universes/imprints, which can be part of the main universe, or can not be (or can be thoroughly confusing). DC Comics' mature readers' imprint Vertigo Comics, for example mainly publishes stand alone ongoing, mini- and maxi-series, but also variously includes characters who were once part of the DCU, or have interacted with it in such a way as to make them at least an honorary part of it. Characters such as The Sandman family of titles, Doom Patrol and Swamp Thing all began publication as part of the DCU, but have gradually drifted to a corner of it quite far removed, if still nominally a part. The WildStorm Universe, which was initially published by Image Comics, is now largely accepted as part of the wider DC Multiverse, but not part of the DCU-proper. Similarly, the Ultimate Marvel Universe is not part of the 616, while the MAX Imprint is on the fringes in a similar way to the Vertigo/DC interaction.\n\nCrossovers can be both internal and between different universes and companies. At their most basic level, a crossover \"can\" refer simply to a character making a guest appearance in a different comic (e.g. Daredevil \"crossing over\" into an issue of a Spider-Man comics), but typically a \"crossover\" implies more than a simple appearance and denotes a cohesive storyline spanning more than one title, often as part of an event. These may also include a tie-in.\n\nAs of 2010, superhero comics are the most popular genre of comic book in North America. There are many definitions of a superhero, and the subject is debated by scholars and industry professionals. Peter Coogan identifies influences to comic book superheroes in the form of super-strong comic strip characters, pulp heroes, masked vigilantes dubbed \"mystery men\", and precursors, who lack specific elements of modern superhero convention. According to Coogan, Superman is the first character to bring together all of the necessary elements. Coogan defines the superhero as \"a heroic character with a selfless, pro-social mission\" who has powers, a codename, colorful costume, and usually a secret identity.\n\nAmerican comic books can be sold through the direct market. Formats include single issues, trade paperback, and graphic novels. Graphic novels may also be known as \"prestige format\" comics for single issues. Issues may be published as one shots or periodically.\n\n\n\n"}

Its ability to fly long distances was restricted because of its small wings.\n\nThe species declined in the course of the 20th century, mainly because of habitat destruction, entanglement with monofilament gillnets and predation by the introduced blotched snakehead (\"Channa maculata\"). Also, the few remaining birds increasingly hybridized with little grebes; as the species differed in several key aspects, the hybrid birds may have suffered from decreased fitness, to the detriment of the \"rufolavatus\" gene pool.\n\nThe Madagascan pochard, which also lived on Lake Alaotra, was thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in 2006. Unlike this species, however, the grebe had poor powers of dispersal and was never found elsewhere.\n\nThe last sighting (which may have been a hybrid with the little grebe) was in 1985 and the species was declared extinct in 2010. Only one photograph of the species is known to exist. Although some species have been classified as extinct and later have been found to still exist, Leon Bennun, the director of the conservation organization BirdLife International has stated that \"no hope remains for this species\" and blames the \"unforeseen consequences\" of human action.\n\nThis extinction brought the number of confirmed bird extinctions since 1600 AD to 162. The previous declaration of a bird species as extinct was that of the Liverpool pigeon (\"Caloenas maculata\") in 2008.

Palmer, 115 N.Y. 506 (1889), is an important New York state civil court case, in which the Court of Appeals of New York issued an 1889 opinion. \"Riggs\" was an example of the judiciary using the \"social purpose\" rule of statutory construction, the process of interpreting and applying legislation.\n\nIn \"Riggs\", a probate suit, the plaintiffs, Mrs. Riggs and Mrs. Preston, sought to invalidate the will of their father Francis B. Palmer; testated on August 13, 1880. The defendant in the case was Elmer E. Palmer, grandson to the testator. The will gave small legacies to two of the daughters, Mrs. Preston and Mrs. Riggs, and the bulk of the estate to Elmer Palmer to be cared for by his mother, Susan Palmer, the widow of a dead son of the testator, until he became of legal age.\n\nKnowing that he was to be the recipient of his grandfather's large estate, Elmer, fearing that his grandfather might change the will, murdered his grandfather by poisoning him. The plaintiffs argued that by allowing the will to be executed Elmer would be profiting from his crime. While a criminal law existed to punish Elmer for the murder, there was no statute under either probate or criminal law that invalidated his claim to the estate based on his role in the murder.\n\nLegal philosopher Ronald Dworkin uses \"Riggs\" in an argument against legal positivism, focusing on a version of positivism by H. L. A. Hart. As a leader of the philosophy of Legal Positivism, Hart argues that the decisions in this case should be based on existing law, which was silent on the issue at the time. Positivism holds that all legal decisions by courts are classified into one of two categories. Some are central to the legal rules at issue. In these cases, judges merely mechanically apply the rules which fall within their jurisdiction. The other category of decisions occupy the \"penumbra\" of legal rules, where the direction of the legal rule is unclear. In these cases, judges must decide which of the possible applications of the legal rules are best social policy and then apply the rule which is best.\n\nDworkin argues that Riggs has two features which contradict Hart's interpretation of the legal process. First, this case does not appear to lie at the edge of legal rules, instead it is very clearly central. Despite this, the majority did not apply the legal rule as required. Second, there appears to be a legitimate debate about what the law \"is\", and not what the law \"should be\", in this case. According to Dworkin, under most versions of legal positivism, Hart's included, there should rarely be debate about what counts as law.\n\nIn \"Taking Rights Seriously\", Dworkin argues that this case shows that in addition to rules established in statutes, principles are also a component of law. These principles, while not binding in the same manner the rules can be, are sufficient to modify statutes as in \"Riggs\". He argues that both the majority and the dissent use these legal principles -- \"one cannot benefit from one's own wrongdoing\" in the case of the majority and \"one should not be punished beyond the ways specified in the statute\" in the case of the dissent.\n\nIn Nepal, this case was referred by the plaintiff lawyers against Renu Dahal for tearing ballot papers.\n\n\n"}

Julian Tenison Woods. Members of the congregation use the postnominal initials RSJ (Religious Sisters of St Joseph).\n\nThe centre of the is at Mary MacKillop Place, Mount Street, North Sydney, New South Wales, where Saint Mary MacKillop's tomb is enshrined in the Mary MacKillop Memorial Chapel.\n\nAt present there are around 850 sisters living and working throughout Australia (South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia) and New Zealand, as well as in Ireland and Peru. The current congregational leader of the Josephites is Sr Monica Cavanagh.\n\nBesides the main center at North Sydney, the Josephites, who were named after Saint Joseph, have \"Mary MacKillop Centres\" at Penola, South Australia; Kensington, South Australia; East Melbourne, Victoria; Annerley, Queensland; and South Perth, Western Australia. The Australian-New Zealand Federation of the Sisters of St Joseph includes Congregations in Perthville and Lochinvar in New South Wales.\n\nFr Woods had been very concerned about the lack of education, particularly Catholic education, in South Australia. In 1866, he invited MacKillop and her sisters Annie and Lexie to come to Penola and open a Catholic school. Woods was appointed director of education and became the founder, along with MacKillop, of a school they opened in a stable there. After renovations by their brother, the MacKillops started teaching more than fifty children. At this time MacKillop made a declaration of her dedication to God and began wearing black.\n\nIn 1867 MacKillop became the first member and superior general of the newly formed religious congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, and moved to a new convent in Grote Street, Adelaide. In the same year, at age 25, she adopted the religious name \"Sister Mary of the Cross\". In Adelaide they founded a new school at the request of the bishop, Laurence Bonaventure Sheil, OFM. Dedicated to the education of the children of the poor, it was the first religious institute to be founded by an Australian. The Rule of Life developed by Woods and MacKillop for the convent emphasised poverty, a dependence on divine providence, no ownership of personal belongings and faith that God would provide, and willingness to go where needed. The Rule were approved by Sheil. Near the end of 1867, ten other women had joined the Josephites, who had adopted a plain brown religious habit. In consequence, the Josephite sisters became colloquially known as the \"Brown Joeys\".\n\nIn an attempt to provide education to all the poor, particularly in country areas, a school was opened at Yankalilla, South Australia, in October 1867. By the end of 1869, more than 70 Josephite sisters were educating children at 21 schools in Adelaide and the country. MacKillop and her Josephites were also involved with an orphanage; neglected children; girls in danger; the aged poor; a reformatory (in St Johns near Kapunda); a home for the aged; and the incurably ill.\n\nIn December 1869, MacKillop and several other sisters travelled to Brisbane to establish the congregation in Queensland. They were based at Kangaroo Point and took the ferry or rowed across the Brisbane River to attend Mass at old St Stephen's Cathedral. Two years later she was in Port Augusta, South Australia, for the same purpose. The Josephite congregation expanded rapidly and, by 1871, 130 sisters were working in more than 40 schools and charitable institutions across South Australia and Queensland.\n\nAfter the acquisition of the Mother House at Kensington in 1872, MacKillop made preparations to leave for Rome to have the Rule of the Sisters of St Joseph approved by the Holy See. She travelled to Rome in 1873 and was encouraged in her work by Pope Pius IX. The authorities in Rome made changes to the way Josephites lived in poverty, declared that the Superior General and her Council were the authorities in charge of the institute, and assured MacKillop that the congregation and their Rule of Life would receive final approval after a trial period. The resulting softening of the Rule caused a breach between MacKillop and Woods, who felt that the revised Rule compromised the ideal of vowed poverty and blamed MacKillop for not getting the Rule accepted in its original form. Before Woods' death on 7 October 1889, he and MacKillop were personally reconciled, but he did not renew his involvement with the congregation. The sisters split, with Woods' branch becoming known as the \"Black Josephites\", for their black habits, while MacKillop's sisters donned brown habits and were thus known as the \"Brown Josephites\".\n\nWhile in Europe, MacKillop travelled widely to observe educational methods.\n\nDuring this period, the Josephites expanded their operations into New South Wales and New Zealand. MacKillop relocated to Sydney in 1883 on the instruction of Bishop Reynolds of Adelaide. When she returned in January 1875, after an absence of nearly two years, she brought approval from Rome for her sisters and the work they did, materials for her school, books for the convent library, several priests, and most of all 15 new Josephites from Ireland. Regardless of her success, she still had to contend with the opposition of priests and several bishops. This did not change after her unanimous election as superior general in March 1875.\n\nThe Josephites were unique among Catholic church ministries in two ways. Firstly, the sisters lived in the community rather than in convents. Secondly, the congregation's constitution required administration by a superior general rather than being subject to the local bishop, a situation unique in its day. This structure resulted in the institute being forced to leave Bathurst in 1876 and Queensland by 1880 due to their respective bishop's refusal to accept this administrative structure.\n\nNotwithstanding all the trouble, the institute expanded. By 1877 it operated more than 40 schools in and around Adelaide, with many others in Queensland and New South Wales. With the help from Benson, Barr Smith, the Baker family, Emanuel Solomon, and other non-Catholics, the Josephites, with MacKillop as their superior general, were able to continue the religious and other good works, including visiting prisoners in jail.\n\nSydney's Archbishop Roger Vaughan died in 1883 and was succeeded by Patrick Francis Moran. Although he had a somewhat positive outlook toward the Josephites, he removed MacKillop as superior general and replaced her with Sister Bernard Walsh.\n\nPope Leo XIII made the Josephites into a religious congregation of Pontifical right in 1885, with its headquarters in Sydney. He gave the final approval to the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart in 1888.\n\nAlthough still living through alms, the Josephite sisters had been very successful. In South Australia they had schools in many country towns including, Willunga, Willochra, Yarcowie, Mintaro, Auburn, Jamestown, Laura, Sevenhill, Quorn, Spalding, Georgetown, Robe, Pekina, and Appila. MacKillop continued her work for the Josephites in Sydney and tried to provide as much support as possible for those in South Australia. In 1883 the institute was successfully established at Temuka in New Zealand, where MacKillop stayed for over a year. In 1889 it was also established in the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nDuring all these years MacKillop assisted Mother Bernard with the management of the Sisters of St Joseph. She wrote letters of support, advice, and encouragement or just to keep in touch. By 1896, MacKillop was back in South Australia visiting fellow sisters in Port Augusta, Burra, Pekina, Kapunda, Jamestown, and Gladstone. That same year she travelled again to New Zealand, spending several months in Port Chalmers and Arrowtown in Otago. During her time in New Zealand the Sisters of St Joseph established a school in the South Island. In 1897, Bishop Maher of Port Augusta arranged for the Sisters of St Joseph to take charge of the St Anacletus Catholic Day School in Petersburg (now Peterborough).\n\nMacKillop founded a convent and base for the Sisters of St Joseph in Petersburg on 16 January 1897. \"On January 16th, 1897, the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Mother Mary of the Cross, arrived in Petersburg to take over the school. She was accompanied by Sister Benizi (who was placed in charge of the school), Sister M. Joseph, Sister Clotilde, and Sister Aloysius Joseph. They were met at the station by Rev. Father Norton who took them to the newly blessed convent, purchased for them on Railway Terrace.\" The property at 40 Railway Terrace is identified as the convent by a plaque placed by the Diocese of Peterborough.\n\nAfter the death of Mother Bernard, MacKillop was once more elected unopposed as superior general in 1899, a position she held until her own death. During the later years of her life she had many problems with her health which continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism and after a stroke in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1902, became paralysed on her right side. For seven years she had to rely on a wheelchair to move around, but her speech and mind were as good as ever and her letter writing had continued unabated after she learned to write with her left hand. Even after suffering the stroke, she inspired enough confidence among the Josephites that she was re-elected in 1905.\n\nMacKillop died on 8 August 1909 in the Josephite convent in North Sydney. The Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Moran, stated that: \"I consider this day to have assisted at the deathbed of a Saint.\" She was laid to rest at the Gore Hill cemetery, a few kilometres up the Pacific Highway from North Sydney. After MacKillop's burial, people continually took earth from around her grave. As a result, her remains were exhumed and transferred on 27 January 1914 to a vault before the altar of the Virgin Mary in the newly built memorial chapel on Mount Street, Sydney. The vault was a gift of Joanna Barr Smith, a lifelong friend and admiring Presbyterian.\n\nThe wide network of schools and community aid organisations established by the sisters continued to expand throughout Australasia and elsewhere during the 20th century. While vocations within Australia suffered along with other religious institutes in the latter 20th century, its work continued and global recognition came with the canonisation of Mary MacKillop in 2010.\n\nSince 1979 the Congregations of St Joseph, made up of all the Sisters of St Joseph and Associates throughout the world, have had a presence at the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). In 1999 the Congregations of St Joseph gained accreditation with the Economic and Social Council at the United Nations, allowing them access to other UN programs and agencies. As an NGO its focus is poverty, empowering women and children, ecology, environment, and immigrants.\n\nThe number of sisters teaching in schools and vocations in general have declined in Australia, however the congregation has incorporated works meeting the needs of today, including:\n\n\nThe work of the Sisters continues among the thousands of lay people who lead and serve in the ministries and direct the focus through being directors of the boards of the incorporated community works. One organisation which has emerged among lay people is Josephite Community Aid. It was formed in 1986 to involve young lay people in community work with refugees and others, along with other volunteer programs. Mary MacKillop Centres were established as focal points for pilgrimage, learning, and spirituality.\n\nBy the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Josephites reported around 850 sisters involved in ministering throughout Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Peru, East Timor, Scotland, and Brazil. The sisters maintained an interest in working in education, aged care, ministry in rural areas, work with indigenous Australians, refugees, families, the homeless, and general pastoral and parish ministries. The South Australian Province Reconciliation Circle, comprising a group of Josephite and Carmelite women together with Aboriginal mentors, began meeting regularly in 2003 to work for justice and reconciliation in indigenous affairs. In 2006 the Conference of Josephite Leaders (Central and Federation Congregations) established the Josephite Justice Office to conduct advocacy in the community.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014 the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Tasmania, Goulburn, Whanganui (Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth), and the Perthville Congregation have all merged as with the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart.\n\nIn 1925, the congregational leader of the Sisters of St Joseph, Mother Laurence, began the process to have MacKillop declared a saint and Archbishop Michael Kelly of Sydney established a tribunal to carry the process forward. After further investigations, MacKillop's \"heroic virtue\" was declared in 1992. Her canonisation was announced on 19 February 2010 and took place on 17 October 2010. An estimated 8,000 Australians were present in Vatican City to witness the ceremony.\n\nSr Irene McCormack RSJ (21 August 1938 – 21 May 1991) was an Australian member of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart who worked as a missionary in Peru. She was executed there in 1991 by members of \"Sendero Luminoso\" (\"Shining Path\"), a Maoist rebel guerrilla organisation.\n\nIn October 2010, Australian media reported McCormack's possible recognised sainthood after Mary MacKillop's canonisation. The \"Daily Telegraph\" reported that senior Peruvian and Australian Catholic clergy planned on preparing a submission to the Vatican for McCormack's cause after Mary MacKillop's canonisation.\n\nThe Congregational Leader of the Sisters of St Joseph, Sister Ann Derwin, said that people in Huasahuasi, who already regarded McCormack as a saint, demanded this, since people judged to have been martyrs do not require evidence of miracles performed through their intercession.\n\n"}

Formed in 1995, the band is centered on vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, who is the only constant member. During its initial tenure, the band released one extended play (EP), \"The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors\" in 1995, before founding members Miller and Jess Margera (drums) went on to form CKY.\n\nMiller returned to the moniker in 2003 to complete work on the album \"Universal Culture Shock\", which featured contributions from guitarist James Murphy. The band returned again in 2014 with a new full lineup and recorded the album \"Galactic Prey\", which was released in 2015. The current lineup includes Miller, guitarist Kenneth Hunter, bassist Shaun Luera and drummer Tim Luera.\n\nDeron Miller and Jess Margera first met at East High School in West Chester, Pennsylvania in 1992, and began performing together as Foreign Objects in 1995. The duo recorded its five-track debut EP \"The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors\" with engineers Bob Zeigler and Matt Wacik in the summer of 1995 at Trix Trax Recording Studios in Malvern, Pennsylvania, and released it through Distant Recordings on October 1 that year.\n\nBy 1996, Miller, Margera and live bassist Ryan Bruni were performing together under the name Oil (a group which would later evolve into CKY), although Foreign Objects did continue recording up until 1998. The first lineup of the band performed two live shows, at least one of which took place at Henderson High School.\n\nIn October 2003, the pair began recording songs for a planned second Foreign Objects release at co-producer John Teague's West Chester studio. Miller enlisted former Death guitarist James Murphy, with whom he was then working on the Death tribute album \"Within the Mind: In Homage to the Musical Legacy of Chuck Schuldiner\", to play lead guitar on the songs. Murphy also co-mixed (with Teague) and mastered the album. Miller praised Murphy's contributions, claiming they made the album \"a thousand times better\".\n\nRecording was completed by spring 2004. \"Universal Culture Shock/Undiscovered Numbers & Colors\", featuring the newly finished songs in addition to a remixed and remastered version of the band's original EP, was released on October 31, 2004 by Distant Recordings in a limited run of 2,000 copies, distributed exclusively through online retailer Amazon.com. The album was later included in the Distant box set \"Distant Recordings 15 Years\" in 2009.\n\nMiller revived the Foreign Objects moniker in 2014, revealing that the group was working on an album entitled \"Galactic Prey\", for which the title track was released in March that year. A campaign on crowdfunding website Indiegogo was later set up for the album, successfully raising the target $13,000. The album was originally slated to feature contributions from Jonathan Masi, a songwriter and fan of the band who reached out to Miller with concepts and ideas for a number of songs.\n\nAs of April 2014, the lineup of the band included guitarist Dave Sudock and bassist Shaun Luera, with Tim Yeung planned to take over on drums. Miller later confirmed that Luera's brother Tim had joined on drums, and later in the year Sudock was replaced by Kenneth Hunter. Miller has claimed that he originally invited Margera to be a part of the Foreign Objects reunion, but that he declined. \"Galactic Prey\" was released on October 18, 2015. In January 2016, Miller revealed that the band would be working on the follow-up to \"Galactic Prey\", which would be titled \"Lean, Mean and Bleeding Green\", that year.\n\nThe musical style of Foreign Objects has been described by music news website Blabbermouth.net as \"neo-technical death metal\". Founding member Deron Miller describes it as \"a project that expands on the style of spacey progressive death metal that Pestilence and Cynic started in 1993\", referring to the releases of \"Spheres\" and \"Focus\", respectively.\n\n\n"}

It is located in Kurukshetra district, approximately 160 km northwest of Delhi, and Kurukshetra’s urban area now merges with Thanesar.\n\nPrabhakarvardhana was a ruler of Thanesar in the early seventh-century CE and was succeeded by his sons, Rajyavardhana and Harsha.\n\nThe name Thanesar is derived from its name in Sanskrit, \"Sthanishvara\" which means \"Place/Abode of the Lord\". (Sthana-Place/region, Ishvara-Lord)\n\nThe present town of Thanesar is located on an ancient mound. The mound 1 km long and 750 m wide known as \"Harsh ka Tila\" (Mound of Harsha), west of Sheikh Chilli's Tomb complex in Thanesar. It has ruins of structures built during the reign of Harsha, 7th century CE. Amongst the archaeological finds from the mound include Painted Grey Ware shards in the pre-Kushana levels and Red Polished Ware from post Gupta period.\n\nIn the post-Gupta period, the ancient city of Sthanishvara was the capital of the Vardhana dynasty, which ruled over a major part of North India during the late-6th and early-7th centuries. Prabhakarvardhana, fourth king of Vardhana dynasty and successor Adityavardhana, had his capital at Thanesar. After his death in 606 CE, his eldest son, Rajyavardhana, ascended the throne. Not long after, Rajyavardhana was murdered by a rival, which led to Harsha ascending to the throne at age 16. In the following years, he conquered much of North India, extended till Kamarupa, and eventually made Kannauj (in present Uttar Pradesh state) his capital, and ruled till 647 CE. His biography \"Harshacharita\" (\"Deeds of Harsha\") written by Sanskrit poet Banabhatta, describes his association with Thanesar, besides mentioning the defence wall, a moat and the palace with a two-storied \"Dhavalagriha\" (white mansion).\n\nThe town was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1011.\n\nDuring Mughal era, the Battle of Thanesar also known as Battle of the Ascetics took place in summer of 1567, between Mughal Emperor Akbar and Rajputs near Thanesar on the banks of the Sarsawati Ghaggar River.\n\nFor much of the 18th century, Thanesar was under the suzerainty of the Maratha Empire, who collected revenue from the local rulers. \n\nThanesar came under the British rule after the British victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1805. Under the British, it was part of the Cis-Sutlej states province from 1809 to 1862. Thanesar was an obscure village until the 1950s. After the partition of India, a large refugee camp was set up here, which became the nucleus of a bustling commercial city. It grew so much that on 23 January 1973, a new district named Kurukshetra district was created, of which Thanesar was the main town. Now Thanesar is a Municipal Council. Thanesar is a Legislative Assembly of Haryana constituency within the Kurukshetra (Lok Sabha constituency). People now tend, erroneously, to refer to Thanesar town as \"Kurukshetra\".\n\nMajority of architectural remains including Karavan serai, cells, and various arched and vaulted structures date from the Mughal period. Building remains of a large palatial structure from the pre-Islamic era were also found with two distinct phases of construction which exposed brick covered drains and rooms situated around a central courtyard.\n\nThanesar was sacked and many of its temples were destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni.\n\nFirishta records that\n\n, the most sacred Hindu place, in the kingdom of Hindoostan. It had reached the ears of the King that Thanesar was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the principal of which they called Jugsoma, pretending that it had existed ever since the creation. Mahmood having reached Punjab, required, according to the subsisting treaty with the Hindu Shahi king Anandpal, that his army should not be molested on its march through his country. An embassy was accordingly sent to inform the Raja of his intentions, and desiring him to send safety guards into his towns and villages, which he would take care to be protected from the followers of his camp. Anandpal the Shahi king, agreeing to this proposal, prepared an entertainment for the reception of the King, at the same time issuing orders for all his subjects to supply the camp with every necessity of life.\n\nThe Raja's brother, with 2,000 horses was also sent to meet the army and to deliver the following message:\n\n\"My brother is the subject and tributary of the King of Gazni, but he begs permission to acquaint his Majesty, that Thanesar is the principal place of worship of the inhabitants of the country: that if it is required by the religion of Mahmood to subvert the religion of others, he has already acquitted himself of that duty, in the destruction of the temple of Nagrakote. But if he should be pleased to alter his resolution regarding Thanesar, Anandpal Tuar promises that the amount of the revenues of that country shall be annually paid to Mahmood, that a sum shall also be paid to reimburse him for the expense of his expedition, besides which, on his own part, he will present him with fifty elephants, and jewels to a considerable amount.\"\n\nMahmood replied, \"The religion of the faithful inculcates the following tenet: ‘That in proportion as the tenets of the Prophet are diffused, and his followers exert themselves in the subversion of idolatry, so shall be their reward in heaven;’ that, therefore, it behooved him, with the assistance of God, to root out the \"worship of idols\" from the face of all India. “How then should he spare Thanesar?\"\n\nThis answer was communicated to Raja Anandpal Tuar of Delhi, who, resolving to oppose Sultan Mahmood, sent messengers throughout Hindoostan to acquaint the other rajas that Mahmood, without provocation, was marching with a vast army to destroy Thanesar, now under his immediate protection. He observed, that if a barrier was not expeditiously raised against this roaring torrent, the country of Hindoostan would be soon overwhelmed, and that it behooved them to unite their forces at Thanesar, to avert the impending calamity.\n\nMahmood, having reached Thanesar before the Hindus, had time to take measures for its defence; the city was plundered, the idols broken, and the idol Jugsoma was sent to Ghazni to be trodden underfoot. According to Hajy Mahommed Kandahary, a ruby was found in one of the temples weighing 450 miskals. It was allowed by everyone who saw it to be a wonder that had never been heard of. About the attack on Thanesar, Utbi wrote \"The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it.\"\n\nMahmood, after the capture of Thanesar, was desirous of proceeding to Delhi. But his nobles told him that it would be impossible to keep possession of it, till he had rendered Multan a province of his own government and secured himself from all apprehension of Anundpal, the Hindushahi Raja of Lahore. The king resolved, therefore, for the present, to proceed no further, till he had accomplished these objects. Anundpal Shahi, however, conducted himself with so much policy and hospitality towards Mahmood, that he returned peaceably to Ghazni. On this occasion, the Mahmood's army brought to Ghazni 200,000 captives, and much wealth, so that the capital appeared like an Indian city, no soldier of the camp being without wealth, or without many slaves.\n\nSheikh Chilli's Tomb is located in Thanesar. This is tomb of Sufi Abd-ur-Rahim Abdul-Karim Abd-ur-Razak, popularly known by the name of Sheikh Chilli. He was Sufi master of Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh. The architectural plan shows considerable Persian influence. This tomb and attached Madarsa are associated with the Sufi Saint Abd-ur-Rahim.\n\nMughal Emperor Akbar, accompanied by his court historian Abul Fazl, visited Kurukshetra during the solar eclipse in 1567. Abul Fazl’s Akbarnama refers to the eclipse in Kurukshetra and the pilgrims bathing in the Brahma Sarovar. The French traveler François Bernier of the Mughal Emperor Shahjehan’s era also mentions the sacred baths at the Indus, Ganges and the sacred tanks of Thaneshwar (Kurukshetra) on the occasion of the solar eclipse.\n\nSikh Gurdwara is equally significant for the Sikhs. It was visited by Guru Amar Das, Guru Hargobind ji, Guru Har Rai ji, Guru Har Krishan ji, Guru Tegh Bahadur ji and Guru Gobind Singh ji. Four Gurdwaras are there in their memory: Gurdwara Dasvin Patshahi (Kurukshetra), Gurdwara Tisari and Satvin Patshahi (Kurukshetra) and Gurdwara Navin Patshahi (Kurukshetra).\nWhen Guru Amar Das Ji went on the 'long journey to Hardwar to see his old friends and acquaintances; and, as he went, scattered the blessings of Nam. On his way he halted at Thaneshwar, where the people asked why he composed hymns in the unknown Punjabi dialect and why not in\nSanskrit-the only language in which great truths can be expressed. The Guru said, \"Sanskrit, now that is no longer the people's tongue, is like well water-sufficient for the irrigation of a small tract of land; whereas Punjabi, being the living language of the people, even if it be nothing but a dialect, is as the rain, which falls in showers all over the country.\"\n\nFor their participation in first war of independence, the Chaudharys and Lambardars of villages who participated in rebellion in Haryana were also deprived of their land and property, including 368 people of Hisar and Gurugram were hanged or transported for life, and fine was imposed on the people of Thanesar (Rs 2,35,000), Ambala (Rs. 25, 3541) and Rohtak (Rs. 63,000 mostly on Ranghars, Shaikhs and Muslim Kasai).\n\nAn archaeological museum run by Archaeological Survey of India, was set up in Sheikh Chilli's Tomb complex. It consists of archaeological finds, like seals and sealings, terracotta figurines, plaques, ornaments, and swords from sites in nearby regions of Kurukshetra and Bhagwanpura. These objects are notably from Kushana (1st-3rd century CE), Gupta period (4th-6th CE), and from post Gupta period on Vardhana dynasty period (6th-7th CE).\n\nThanesar derives its name from the words \"Sthaneshwar\" which means \"Place of God.\" The Sthaneshwar Mahadev Temple, whose presiding deity is Lord Shiva, is believed to be place where the Pandavas with Krishna prayed to Lord Shiva and received his blessings for victory in the battle of Mahabharata. It is the central and the most important place in the 48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra. 1.5 km from Thanesar on Kurukshetra-Pehowa road lies Narkatari, the water tank named Bhishma Kund is believed to be the spot when Bhishma lay of the bed of arrows during the Mahabharata war.\n\nKaleshwar Mahadev Temple and Dukha Bhanjan Mahadev Temples are the oldest temples of Thanesar. Other religious sites include the Brahma Sarovar, Jyotisar, the Sannihit Sarovar, Gurdwara 6th Patashahi and the Devi Bhadrakali temple, which is counted among the 51 Shakti Peethas. The bathing-fair held here on the occurrence of a solar eclipse is said to be attended by half a million pilgrims.\n\nHindu genealogy registers at Thanesar are the genealogy registers of pilgrims maintained here.\n\nThe modern city of Thanesar is an important educational center; it is home to Kurukshetra University, the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra (Formerly Regional Engineering College), University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), Kurukshetra University and world's first AYUSH University Shri Krishna AYUSH University. A public school namely Gita Niketan, opposite old Rudra talkies, on salarpur road. The University Institute of Engineering and Technology (U.I.E.T.) is situated in lush green campus of Kurukshetra University with about 1000 students on its roll. It has grown into a big institute with excellent placement record right from its inception. The Kurukshetra Institute of Technology & Management (KITM) is located 10 km from Kurukshetra University on Pehowa road, near Bhor Saidan village.\nThanesar now has a Municipal Council from 1994. In 1994 the municipal elections were conducted by the state government after a long time.\n\nThanesar is located at . It has an average elevation of 232 metres (761 feet).\n\nAs of 2011 census of India, Thanesar had a population of 154,962. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45% (83,655 - 71,307). Thanesar has an average literacy rate of 85.73%, higher than the national average of 74.04: male literacy is 89.89%, and female literacy is 80.85%. In Thanesar, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214951", "title": "Peace of Thorn (1411)", "text": "Peace of Thorn (1411)\n\nThe (First) Peace of Thorn was a peace treaty formally ending the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War between allied Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania on one side, and the Teutonic Knights on the other. It was signed on 1 February 1411 in Thorn (Toruń), one of the southernmost cities of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights. In historiography, the treaty is often portrayed as a diplomatic failure of Poland–Lithuania as they failed to capitalize on the decisive defeat of the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in June 1410. The Knights returned Dobrzyń Land which they captured from Poland during the war and made only temporary territorial concessions in Samogitia, which returned to Lithuania only for the lifetimes of Polish King Władysław Jagiełło and Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas. The Peace of Thorn was not stable. It took two other brief wars, the Hunger War in 1414 and Gollub War in 1422, to sign the Treaty of Melno that solved the territorial disputes. However, large war reparations were a significant financial burden on the Knights, causing internal unrest and economic decline. The Teutonic Knights never recovered their former might.\n\nIn May 1409, an uprising started in Samogitia, which had been in Teutonic hands since the Peace of Raciąż of 1404. Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas supported the uprising. Poland, which had been in a personal union with Lithuania since 1386, also announced its support to the Samogitian cause. Thus the local uprising escalated into a regional war. The Teutonic Knights first invaded Poland, catching the Poles by surprise and capturing the Dobrzyń Land without much resistance. However, neither side was ready for a full-scale war and agreed to a truce mediated by Wenceslaus, King of the Romans in October 1409. When the truce expired in June 1410, allied Poland–Lithuania invaded Prussia and met the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Grunwald. The Knights were soundly defeated, with most of their leadership killed. Following the battle, most Teutonic fortresses surrendered without resistance and the Knights were left with only eight strongholds. However, the allies delayed their Siege of Marienburg, giving the Knights enough time to organize defense. The Polish–Lithuanian army, suffering from lack of ammunition and low morale, failed to capture the Teutonic capital and returned home in September. The Knights quickly recaptured their fortresses that were taken by the Poles. Polish King Jogaila raised a fresh army and dealt another defeat to the Knights in the Battle of Koronowo in October 1410. Heinrich von Plauen, new Teutonic Grand Master, wanted to continue fighting and attempted to recruit new crusaders. However, the Teutonic Council preferred peace and both sides agreed to a truce, effective between 10 December 1410 and 11 January 1411. Three-day negotiations in Raciąż between Jogaila and von Plauen broke down and Teutonic Knights invaded Dobrzyń Land again. The incursion resulted in a new round of negotiations that ended with the Peace of Thorn signed on 1 February 1411.\n\nThe borders were returned to their pre-1409 state with exception of Samogitia. The Teutonic Order relinquished its claims to Samogitia but only for the lifetimes of Polish King Jogaila and Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas. After their deaths, Samogitia was to return to the Knights. (Both rulers were at the time aged men.) In the south, the Dobrzyń Land, captured by the Knights during the war, was ceded back to Poland. Thus, the Knights suffered virtually no territorial losses – a great diplomatic achievement after the crushing defeat in the Battle of Grunwald. All sides agreed that any future territorial disputes or border disagreements would be resolved via international mediation. Borders were open for international trade, which was more beneficial to Prussian cities. Jogaila and Vytautas also promised to convert all remaining pagans in Lithuania, which officially converted to Christianity in 1386, and Samogitia, which was not yet officially converted.\n\nAfter the Battle of Grunwald, Poland–Lithuania held some 14,000 captives. Most of the commoners and mercenaries were released shortly after the battle on condition that they report to Kraków on 11 November 1410. Only those who were expected to pay ransom were kept in captivity. Considerable ransoms were recorded; for example, the mercenary Holbracht von Loym had to pay \"150 kopas of Prague groschens\", or more than 30 kg of silver. The Peace of Thorn settled the ransoms \"en masse\": the Polish King released all the captives in exchange for \"100,000 kopas of Prague groschen\", amounting to nearly of silver payable in four annual installments. In the case of the failure to pay one of the installments, the indemnities were to rise by an additional 720,000 Prague groschen. The ransom was equal to £850,000, ten times the annual income of King of England.\n\nIn order to raise the money needed to pay the ransom, Grand Master Heinrich von Plauen needed to raise taxes. He called a council of representatives from Prussian cities to approve a special levy. Danzig (Gdańsk) and Thorn (Toruń) revolted against the new tax, but were subdued. The Knights also confiscated church silver and gold and borrowed heavily abroad. The first two installments were paid in full and on time. However, further payments were difficult to collect as the Knights emptied their treasury trying to rebuild their castles and army, which heavily relied on paid mercenaries. They also sent expensive gifts to the Pope and Sigismund of Hungary to ensure their continued support to the Teutonic cause. Tax records indicated that harvest was modest in those years and that many communities fell three years behind their taxes.\n\nSoon after the conclusion of the peace, disagreements arose regarding the ill-defined borders of Samogitia. Vytautas claimed that all territory north of the Neman River, including port city Memel (Klaipėda), was part of Samogitia and thus should be transferred to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In March 1412, Sigismund of Hungary agreed to mediate reduction to the third installment, demarcation of the Samogitian border, and other matters. The delegations met in Buda (Ofen), residence of Sigismund, where lavish feasts, tournaments, and hunts were organized. The celebrations included wedding of Cymburgis of Masovia, Jogaila's niece, to Ernest, Duke of Austria. In August 1412, Sigismund announced that the Peace of Thorn was proper and fair and appointed Benedict Makrai to investigate the border claims. The installments were not reduced and the last payment was made on time in January 1413. Makrai announced his decision in May 1413, allotting the entire northern bank, including Memel, to Lithuania. The Knights refused to accept this decision and the inconclusive Hunger War broke out in 1414. The negotiations continued at the Council of Constance and the dispute was not resolved until the Treaty of Melno in 1422.\n\nOverall, the Peace of Thorn had a negative long-term impact on Prussia. By 1419, 20% of Teutonic land lay abandoned and its currency was debased to meet expenses. Increased taxes and economic decline exposed internal political struggles between bishops, secular knights, and city residents. These political rifts only grew with further wars with Poland–Lithuania and eventually resulted in the Prussian Confederation and civil war that tore Prussia in half (Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)).\n\n"}

Following unsuccessful skirmishes against John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (based at Stirling), Mar was eventually persuaded to lead his full army south, on 10 November. Spies informed Argyll of Mar's actions, and he moved his army of about 4,000 to Sheriffmuir, near Dunblane. The two armies met on the battlefield on 13 November 1715.\n\nArgyll was seriously outnumbered by the Jacobite army (which was somewhat diminished from its previous numbers), and his left wing, commanded by General Thomas Whetham, was far shorter than the Jacobites' opposing right. Argyll's right wing attacked, and managed to drive the Highlanders back, but Whetham's soldiers were overpowered by a much larger force. Argyll came to the aid of Whetham's men. By evening, both armies were seriously reduced, and although Mar had a great advantage in numbers, he refused to risk the entirety of his army, allowing Argyll to withdraw.\n\nThe battle was inconclusive, with both sides claiming victory. However, in strategic terms Argyll had halted the Jacobite advance. Those government regiments present that were titled 'King's' were awarded the White Horse of Hanover as a badge of battle honour. The engagement only served to demoralize the Jacobite army who, with their superior numbers, felt they should have decisively won. Mar's French and Spanish supporters in particular withdrew their forces.\n\nThe modern Scottish archaeologist and TV commentator Neil Oliver states that in hindsight the Jacobite failure of the rising of 1715 seems astonishing in that the Jacobite leader, the Earl of Mar, could easily have moved past the Duke of Argyll to link up with the English Jacobites and Catholics in the north of England, had he had the merest sense of how to fight a campaign rather than lead a parade.\n\nOn 23 December, the Old Pretender, who had been exiled in France, landed at Peterhead, his cause largely lost. He met with Mar at Perth, but was unable to rouse the disheartened army. Argyll, reinforced and invigorated, soon advanced north, while the Jacobite army fled to Montrose, and the Pretender returned to France. The Army moved to Ruthven, and dispersed.\n\nThe period was fatal in the extreme to the Jacobite Pretender. The whole body of his adherents in the south had fallen into the hands of generals Willis and Carpenter at Preston, and Inverness, with all the adjacent country, had been recovered to the government, through the exertions of pro-government clans including the Earl of Sutherland, Fraser Lord Lovat, the Rosses, the Munros, and the Forbeses.\n\nThe number of the slain on the side of the rebels has been stated to have been eight hundred, among whom were John Lyon, 5th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and the chief of the Clan Ranald of Clan MacDonald, and several others of distinction. James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure and Drummond of Logie were among the wounded. It meant that the Jacobite army had to withdraw to Perth. Argyll considered himself the victor and struck a medal to commemorate his feat.\n\nOf the government army, there were killed, and wounded, upwards of six hundred. Archibald Douglas, 2nd Earl of Forfar was the only person of eminence killed on that side.\n\nA famous Jacobite song, \"Sheriffmuir fight\", was written about the battle. As with many such songs, the battle is presented as a noble victory for the Jacobite army. The song was collected by, and perhaps written by, James Hogg in 1819.\n\nThe Battle was the subject of \"The Battle of Sherramuir\", one of the most famous songs written by Robert Burns . The song was written when Burns toured the Highlands in 1787 and was first published in The Scots Musical Museum, appearing in volume III, 1790. It was written to be sung to the \"Cameronian Rant\".\n\nBurns knew that the battle ended so inconclusively that it was unclear which side had won and the poem is the account of the battle by two shepherds taking contrary views. One of the shepherds believes that \"the red-coat lads wi' black cockades\" routed the rebels, painting a fearful picture of how they managed to \"hough the Clans like nine-pin kyles\". The other shepherd is just as convinced that the Jacobites \"did pursue / The horsemen back to Forth, man\" with the eventual result that \"...mony a huntit, poor Red-coat / For fear amaist did swarf, man.\"\n\nDissatisfied with the first published version of the poem, Burns re-wrote it sometime after 1790. The revised version was published after Burns' death by his editor, James Currie MD in \"The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author\" (1800).\n\n\n"}

The largest performing arts organization in Indiana, the orchestra is based at the Hilbert Circle Theatre in downtown Indianapolis on Monument Circle.\n\nThe orchestra was founded in 1930 by Ferdinand Schaefer, a local violin professor, with the help of Leonard A. Strauss; the latter became the first president of the ISO. In 1937, Fabien Sevitzky was hired as the orchestra's first music director, as the musicians became fully professional, paid a weekly salary for a 20-week season. The orchestra quickly ascended to national prominence, issuing a series of phonograph recordings on RCA Victor and Capitol Records in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nIn 1956, Izler Solomon was appointed music director. The orchestra toured nationally and produced a series of international salute concerts. This series won a US State Department Award.\n\nThe orchestra performed in such venues as Clowes Hall on the campus of Butler University and Caleb Mills Hall. John Nelson became music director in 1976. During his tenure, the orchestra relocated to the renovated Hilbert Circle Theatre in downtown Indianapolis, which re-opened on October 12, 1984. Nelson brought the ISO back to the airwaves on NPR and PBS, as well as concerts in Carnegie Hall in 1989 and 1991 and at the Kennedy Center. In 1987, he took the orchestra on its first-ever foreign tour in Germany, with concertmaster Hidetaro Suzuki.\n\nRaymond Leppard succeeded Nelson as music director, in 1987. Under Leppard's direction, the orchestra began a 52-week season, and made a series of recordings on the Koss Classics label. Leppard returned the orchestra to Europe for two more tours in 1993 and 1997. \"Indianapolis On The Air\", a weekly radio series begun in 1994, is produced by WFYI in Indianapolis and is syndicated to over 250 radio stations in 38 states. In 2009, the ISO announced its first-ever ensemble-in-residence, Time for Three.\n\nIn April 2010, Krzysztof Urbański first guest-conducted the orchestra. He was subsequently engaged for a return appearance in June 2010 at the orchestra's summer series, \"Symphony on the Prairie\". Based on these two appearances, the ISO named Urbański its 7th music director, effective September 1, 2011, with an initial contract of 4 years. In May 2019, the orchestra announced that Urbanski will conclude his tenure as its music director at the close of the 2020-2021 season.\n\nAnnually, the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra performs 200 concerts for over 350,000 people. It has a discography of 36 recordings. The Kroger \"Symphony on the Prairie\", performed at Conner Prairie in Fishers, has been a popular summer series since 1982. It has drawn a record 13,000 attendees for the Patriotic Pops night. \n\nSome of the orchestra's earliest recordings have re-appeared on the Historic Recording label.\n\n\n"}

He was also a nazi concentration camp survivor and later served as a member of the French parliament.\n\nMarcel Paul was a foundling. His birthday is given as 12 July 1900, the date he was found in the 14th arrondissement in Paris. He began working at age 13, and became politically active at the age of 15 with socialist youth against the war.\n\nHe was conscripted into the navy, where he joined the sailors who refused to be a strikebreaker against striking workers at the Saint-Nazaire power station. At his discharge, he settled first at Saint-Quentin, Aisne, then Paris, where he worked as an electrician. In 1923, he left the French socialist party and in 1927, joined the French Communist Party (PCF), becoming close to Maurice Thorez, though he maintained his union ties.\n\nHe was conscripted into the army in 1939 during the Phoney War. Paul was taken prisoner by the nazis, but managed to escape and fled to Brittany, where he established contact with the PCF and its regional leader, Auguste Havez. Paul joined Havez to form a branch of the party aiming to integrate the Resistance. In November 1940, he returned to Paris and led an insurgent group, the PCF's \"Organisation Spéciale\" (\"Special Organization\"), while creating connections with the trade unions. The Organisation Spécial was later renamed FTP-MOI),\n\nPaul organized an attack against Hermann Göring, but it failed. He was denounced and arrested on 13 November 1941 and tortured by Prefecture of Police Special Brigadesmen in the police station of Saint-Denis. First held in Fontevraud-l'Abbaye, he was transferred to Blois and delivered to the Germans. He was then taken to Compiègne and subsequently deported to Auschwitz concentration camp and Buchenwald. While at Buchenwald, he took part in the April 1945 insurrection. Paul also helped save the life of many inmates, including the industrialist Marcel Dassault, who later became an important financial backer of the PCF newspaper \"L'Humanité\".\n\nAfter the liberation of France, he became Minister of Industrial Production of the interim government under Charles de Gaulle. He voted for nationalization of electricity and natural gas on April 8, 1946, creating Électricité de France and Gaz de France. He was deputy leader of the PCF in Haute-Vienne at the Second Constituent National Assembly and served in the French National Assembly from 1945 to 1948, when he resigned. Paul was on the Central Committee of the PCF from 1945 to 1964.\n\nPaul was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor in April 1982. After the ceremony on 11 November 1982 at the Place de l'Étoile in Paris, Paul was taken ill and died at his home a few hours later.\n\nThe great hall of the labour council in Saint-Denis bears his name, as well as a number of streets in various cities in France, including in the 14th arrondissement in Paris.\n\nTwo years after Paul's death, a controversy arose concerning his activities in Buchenwald. Laurent Wetzel, a CDS politician from Sartrouville, wrote an article in which he explained his refusal to support renaming a local street after Paul. He accused Paul of having cooperated with the internal management at the camp, thereby having determined the fate (the death) of a number of prisoners and he accused Paul of having given greater priority to the interests of his party. The Association Dora-Buchenwald and the Fédération nationale des déportés et internés résistants et patriotes filed a libel suit. The trial was held in Versailles and heard testimony from a number of former concentration camp prisoners. Wetzel was acquitted but the court refused to rule on the historical truth. A similar accusation had been raised against Paul in 1946.\n"}

He often takes sounds from everyday items to produce electronic music.\n\nIn 1998, Herbert issued \"Around the House,\" which mixed dance beats, sounds generated by everyday kitchen objects, and vocals. By the late Nineties, Herbert was remixing tracks for dance artists like Moloko, Motorbass, Alter Ego, and others. (Many of these were later collected on \"Secondhand Sounds: Herbert Remixes\".) He also recorded singles, EPs, and albums under a variety of aliases (Doctor Rockit, Radio Boy, Mr. Vertigo, and Transformer) as well as his own name.\n\nIn 2001, Herbert issued \"Bodily Functions\". Similar in structure to \"Around the House,\" it featured sounds generated by manipulating human hair and skin as well as internal bodily organs. \"Bodily Functions\" benefited a record deal with Studio !K7, making it Herbert's first full-length work to receive worldwide distribution.\n\n\"Goodbye Swingtime\", a 2003 album issued under the name The Matthew Herbert Big Band, combined the political commentary of Radio Boy with the song structure of his Herbert albums. Recorded with sixteen musicians from the British jazz world, including saxophonists Dave O'Higgins and Nigel Hitchcock, pianist Phil Parnell, and bassist Dave Green, the band is complemented on stage by Siciliano, Arto Lindsay, Warp recording artist Jamie Lidell, and Mara Carlyle.\n\nIn 2005, he released a record entitled \"Plat du Jour\", a record made entirely from objects and situations in the food chain. He recorded beneath the sewers of Fleet Street, with Vietnamese coffee beans, inside industrial chicken farms, drove a tank over a recreation of the dinner that Nigella Lawson cooked for George Bush and Tony Blair, and recorded 3500 people biting an apple at the same time. The track entitled \"The Final Meal of Stacey Lawton\" was made in collaboration with renowned chef Heston Blumenthal.\n\nOn 30 May 2006, Herbert issued \"Scale\", his most successful album to date. In the US, it reached number 20 on \"Billboard\"'s electronic music album chart. Entertainment Weekly remarked, \"Herbert sneakily subverts Scale's apocalyptic thematic thread into something warm and danceable.\" Online magazine Pitchfork Media noted, \"Sophisticated and whimsical, joyful and yet tinged with sadness, Scale is one of this year's great albums.\"\n\nThe second album Matthew Herbert Big Band, \"There's Me And There's You\", was released in October 2008. In the making of the record Herbert recorded inside the Houses of Parliament, at a landfill site, and in the lobby of the British Museum with 70 volunteers.\n\nIn 2009 Matthew Herbert was involved in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. He wrote and produced the music accompanying the 42 \"postcards,\" short films introducing the country being represented next. In addition, Herbert wrote an orchestral piece for an interval act involving two \"children flying in on a giant plastic swan.\"\n\nIn 2010 Matthew Herbert released two of a three part trilogy of albums. The first, \"One One\", was entirely written and performed by Herbert alone, the second, \"One Club\", was made exclusively out of sounds recorded at the Robert Johnson nightclub in Offenbach in Germany on one night.\n\nThat same year he also released a reworking of Mahler's tenth symphony for the Deutsche Grammophon's Recomposed series. Much of the recording was made inside Mahler's composing hut in Toblach, by his graveside and in a crematorium.\n\nIn late 2011, the final part of the trilogy, \"One Pig\", was released. Herbert recorded the life cycle of a farmed pig from birth to the dinner plate. The animal rights organisation PETA condemned the album when it was announced without hearing it. Herbert, who is not a vegetarian, responded that their complaints were \"utterly absurd\" and that he wanted his music to encourage people to \"listen to the world a little more carefully.\" In the same year his 2001 track \"Café de Flore\", originally recorded for a Yves St Laurent fashion show and named after the Café de Flore in Paris, was featured prominently in the soundtrack of the film \"Café de Flore\".\n\nOn 11 March 2013 a newly commissioned work by Herbert, for orchestra with electronics, based on a work by Rameau, was performed at The Roundhouse in London, as part of BBC Radio 3's \"Baroque Remixed\" series.\n\nOn 20 March 2015 Herbert announced \"The Shakes\", his first album of dance music in nine years. This was followed up with the release of \"Middle,\" the first track from the album. \"The Shakes\" was released in an innovative way, making one track and short accompanying film available on streaming and video platforms each week leading up to the album release.\n\nIn 2000, Herbert wrote a manifesto titled \"Personal Contract for the Composition of Music (Incorporating the Manifest of Mistakes)\", which served as a theoretical guide for much of his later work. Its goals include a personal ban on using drum machines and pre-existing samples, and ensuring that anything created in the studio can be replicated in live performance.\n\nMany of his less dance-oriented projects (chiefly those not recorded under the name Herbert) address political concerns, using specific objects to create a conceptual piece. His 2001 project as Radio Boy, \"The Mechanics of Destruction\" sampled McDonald's and The Gap merchandise as a protest against corporate globalism. It was made available as a free MP3 download, via concerts and by post from Accidental Records.\n\nIn 2005, Herbert released the album \"Plat du Jour\" under his real name, Matthew Herbert. The disc addresses commercial food production and marketing.\n\nIn February 2006, Herbert helped form the virtual community Country X. In an introduction posted on the website, he writes, \"Why not start a country? only this time, a virtual one. free from the necessity to defend its borders physically, we can reduce the violence of exclusion. a new description of resistance.\"\n\nHerbert shared some of his thoughts on the future in an article for the UK music magazine \"Clash\", writing \"we are facing a perfect storm of shit: global financial meltdown, massive climatic shifts and the end of oil.\"\n\nBy 2000 Herbert assembled several microlabels he initiated, including Soundslike (for his Herbert alias) and Lifelike (originally called Lowlife, begun in 1998 for his Doctor Rockit alias), under the umbrella Accidental Records. In addition to documenting Herbert's sundry projects, these imprints issued works from The Soft Pink Truth, Mara Carlyle, Mugison, and Beckett & Taylor, among others. Between 2008 and 2009, the label released 'Butterflies' by Finn Peters, the sophomore record of Matthew Herbert Big Band named \"There's Me And There's You\", The Invisible's debut album, Setsubun Bean Unit, and Micachu's debut named \"Jewellery\".\n\n2010/2011 sees the release of a trilogy concept album by Herbert, beginning with \"One One\", followed by \"One Club\" and \"One Pig\".\n\nHejira's debut album \"Prayer Before Birth\" was released on the label on 21 October 2013.\n\nMatthew Herbert has produced remixes for numerous artists, including Moloko, Ennio Morricone, Quincy Jones, PUZZLE, Björk, REM, Perry Farrell, Serge Gainsbourg, Yoko Ono, John Cale, The Avalanches and Cornelius. He programmed three tracks on Björk's \"Vespertine\", and produced The Invisible's debut album, along with Moloko singer Róisín Murphy's album \"Ruby Blue\". He has also produced albums for Micachu, Merz and Finn Peters\n\nHe has contributed music to several films, including La confiance règne, \"Human Traffic\", Dogme 95, director Kristian Levring's The Intended, Agathe Cléry, Le Défi (Dance Challenge), A Number, as well as UK television, theatrical and concert dance productions.\n\nHerbert also wrote music for the YouTube documentary film \"Life in a Day\" along with prominent composer Harry Gregson-Williams.\n\nIn 2010 he produced a new project at the invitation of \"London Sinfonietta\" called One Day in which he set to music a Saturday edition of the Guardian newspaper, performed at London's Southbank Centre in the London Jazz Festival. He went on to create a short encore for the ensemble involving a live remix of a concert at the BBC Proms in 2012 using recordings on mobile phones.\n\nIn 2012 he is relaunching the museum of sound at www.museumofsound.com\n\nAlso in 2012, he was appointed as the creative director of the newly revived BBC Radiophonic Workshop.\n\nHerbert wrote the score for the 2017 film A Fantastic Woman, which was released by Milan Records in January 2018.\n\nIn February 2018, the current Doctor Who logo was revealed in a short video clip, with music and sound created by Herbert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nevertheless, there are significant similarities in the behaviors of apparently disparate plasmas. Understanding the scaling of plasma behavior is of more than theoretical value. It allows the results of laboratory experiments to be applied to larger natural or artificial plasmas of interest. The situation is similar to testing aircraft or studying natural turbulent flow in wind tunnels with smaller-scale models.\n\nSimilarity transformations (also called similarity laws) help us work out how plasma properties change in order to retain the same characteristics. A necessary first step is to express the laws governing the system in a nondimensional form. The choice of nondimensional parameters is never unique, and it is usually only possible to achieve by choosing to ignore certain aspects of the system.\n\nOne dimensionless parameter characterizing a plasma is the ratio of ion to electron mass. Since this number is large, at least 1836, it is commonly taken to be infinite in theoretical analyses, that is, either the electrons are assumed to be massless or the ions are assumed to be infinitely massive. In numerical studies the opposite problem often appears. The computation time would be intractably large if a realistic mass ratio were used, so an artificially small but still rather large value, for example 100, is substituted. To analyze some phenomena, such as lower hybrid oscillations, it is essential to use the proper value.\n\nOne commonly used similarity transformation was derived for gas discharges by James Dillon Cobine (1941), Alfred Hans von Engel and Max Steenbeck (1934). They can be summarised as follows:\n\nThis scaling applies best to plasmas with a relatively low degree of ionization. In such plasmas, the ionization energy of the neutral atoms is an important parameter and establishes an absolute \"energy\" scale, which explains many of the scalings in the table:\n\nWhile these similarity transformations capture some basic properties of plasmas, not all plasma phenomena scale in this way. Consider, for example, the degree of ionization, which is dimensionless and thus would ideally remain unchanged when the system is scaled. The number of charged particles per unit volume is proportional to the current density, which scales as \"x\", whereas the number of neutral particles per unit volume scales as \"x\" in this transformation, so the degree of ionization does not remain unchanged but scales as \"x\".\n\n"}

The Football Association staged the second edition of the FA Cup and Wanderers retained the trophy by defeating Oxford University in the final. The first officially recognised international football match took place on 30 November 1872 when Scotland hosted England.\n\nThe Scotland v England match in November 1872 is now officially recognised by FIFA as the first-ever international football match. The Football Association (FA) had initiated five matches between English and Scottish players since 1870, but those are now rated as representative games only because the Scotland teams consisted entirely of Anglo-Scots.\n\nThe first international match that is now officially recognised took place after Queen's Park, the leading Scottish club at the time, invited the FA to select an England team to face a Scotland team (which, as they selected it, consisted entirely of Queen's Park players). The match took place at the Hamilton Crescent cricket ground in Partick, Glasgow on 30 November 1872 and ended in a 0–0 draw in front of around 4,000 spectators. England's team was captained by Cuthbert Ottaway of Oxford University and consisted of players from eight different clubs and one Army regiment.\n\nThe FA hosted a return match at Kennington Oval on 8 March 1873, now officially rated the first international match in England. England adopted Scotland's 2–2–6 formation but retained only two of the players who had appeared in the November match. These were Harwood Greenhalgh of Notts County in defence and Charles Chenery of the original Crystal Palace club in attack. This team had a strong Wanderers influence with Leonard Howell, Walpole Vidal, Alexander Bonsor, William Kenyon-Slaney and Hubert Heron all selected (there were no Wanderers players in the Glasgow match). Of those, however, only Heron would play more than two matches for England. The other players selected were Alexander Morten in goal, William Clegg (whose brother Charlie had played in the previous match) and two Royal Engineers, Pelham von Donop and Alfred Goodwyn.\n\nThe Scotland team lacked funding and could only raise enough money to cover rail fares for eight players to travel. Their team was augmented by three of the Anglo-Scots who had appeared in the representative matches: A. F. Kinnaird, John Blackburn and Henry Renny-Tailyour. The match ended in a 4–2 victory for England with Kenyon-Slaney scoring the first-ever international goal. The Scottish Football Association was belatedly formed on 13 March, five days after the second match, and assumed responsibility for running the Scotland team.\n\nIn the second edition of the FA Cup, the rules granted automatic qualification to the final for the holders, Wanderers, on a challenge basis similar to that employed in boxing. The final was played on 29 March 1873 at Lillie Bridge, a ground which Wanderers sometimes used as their home venue. Wanderers retained the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Oxford University. The challenge rule was scrapped after this match so that, in 1874, Wanderers began their defence in the first round with all other entrants.\n\nOxford University came through four rounds to reach the final. In turn, they defeated Crystal Palace at home 3–2, Clapham Rovers away 0–3 and Royal Engineers at home 1–0. In the semi-final, they were due to play Queen's Park but the Scottish club withdrew and Oxford University went into the final on a walkover.\n\n"}

{"id": "2215034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215034", "title": "Ike's Wee Wee", "text": "Ike's Wee Wee\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" is the third episode of the second season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 17th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 20, 1998. In the episode, school counselor Mr. Mackey is fired, and turns to drugs. Meanwhile, the boys misconstrue what circumcision entails, and try to save Kyle's younger brother Ike from his upcoming bris.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" satirizes certain attitudes towards drug users, and explores whether family can only mean those who are related by blood. This episode introduced Ike's backstory as an adopted Canadian child. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" received positive responses from critics, who especially praised the episode for its touching moments.\n\nMr. Mackey, the school counselor, is giving a drug and alcohol prevention lecture to the class, emphasizing that smoking, drinking, marijuana, and LSD are bad. He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle invites Stan, Cartman, and Kenny to his younger brother Ike's bris. When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party where they are going to remove his penis, Kyle tries to find a way to hide his brother from his parents and the circumcision process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to Nebraska and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, which leads to them to think that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his biological brother, but was adopted from Canada due to the tombstone featuring the Canadian flag. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is no longer his brother. His parents are shocked after Kyle reveals the truth, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska.\n\nThe day of the bris arrives, and Kyle is grounded for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts a change of heart in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At the beginning and end of the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, \"There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college\", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: \"Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now.\" Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode \"The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000\".\n\nThe episode introduced Ike's backstory as a Canadian child adopted by the Broflovskis. Ever since the recurring characters Terrance and Phillip were established to be Canadians in the season one finale \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", and the subsequent season two premiere \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", all Canadian characters on \"South Park\" have shared the same simplistic design: having simple beady eyes and a floppy head made up of two halves. While Ike had been on the show since its first episode, the writers originally did not know that he was going to be Canadian; he was retroactively made one based on his visual similarity to Terrance and Phillip. Ike's backstory would play an important role in the film \"\", which involves a fictional American–Canadian war, as well as in future episodes of the series, such as the season seven episode, \"It's Christmas in Canada\", in which Ike's biological parents take him away from the Broflovskis and bring him back to Canada.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" features regular voice acting from series creators Parker and Matt Stone for most characters, Mary Kay Bergman (credited as Shannen Cassidy) for female characters, and Isaac Hayes for Chef. Additional dialogue was provided by \"South Park\" audio engineer Bruce Howell, while Ike's lines were uttered by Howell's then-5-year-old son Jesse.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" raises the question of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of \"those for whom we care that are related by blood\". Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that \"Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about.\" Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.\n\nThe subplot of \"Ike's Wee Wee\" satirizes certain drug subcultures, as well as drug use, and societal attitudes towards drug users. The way the episode portrays Mr. Mackey's lack of real knowledge about drug use and addiction has been described as an example of \"South Park\" satirizing left-wing politics, when \"they lead to the sort of hypocrisy inconsistent with a proper open society\".\n\nPart of the episode revolves around the practice of religious male circumcision in Judaism, and the related ceremony called the \"brit milah\" or bris, and the boys' misunderstanding of the tradition. The boys believe that circumcision entails the cutting off of one's penis, which they refer to by the childish colloquial term \"wee wee\", except for Cartman, who insists on calling it \"fireman\". Cannabis is also referred to by various names, including \"weed\", \"grass\", \"pot\", and \"marijuana\", in which Mr. Mackey constantly pronounces the letter \"j\" as (as in \"jam\"), which makes Kyle mispronounce the drug as \"marry-Jew wanna\".\n\nDrug use is often portrayed in conjunction with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term \"hippie\" pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to a Grateful Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching \"Teletubbies\" while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.\n\nWhile walking home, Mr. Mackey drunkenly sings the 1983 Pat Benatar song \"Love Is a Battlefield\". During Ike's supposed funeral, a bagpipe player starts playing the Hebrew folk song \"Hava Nagila\". At the funerals, the priest uses the phrase \"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust\", from the Anglican burial service. When the townspeople start to harass Mackey, one of them shouts, \"Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common... Dope!\". This references the famous catchphrase from \"The Simpsons\", \"D'oh!\", which sounds similar to the word \"dope\", meaning illicit drugs. At Kyle's house, Kyle's parents offer the boys a dish called \"GaHekgafuga\", which is not a real dish. When Mackey is in India, he is captured by members of The A-Team, and driven away in their van. Mackey is taken to rehabilitation to the Betty Ford Clinic, which is based on a real-life hospital.\n\nA common plot device is referenced, where a shoulder angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, as both the devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used to show that a character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).\n\nIn the scene where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without answering the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, \"Dammit, children, why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!\". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says \"Ham?\", to which Stan angrily replies, \"No, not ham, you fat fuck!\". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in \"The Spirit of Christmas\", the 1995 short film that was the precursor to \"South Park\".\n\nTwo episodes preceded \"Ike's Wee Wee\" in the second season of the show. The episode scheduled for April 1, 1998 promised to resolve the cliffhanger ending of the first season finale, \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", regarding the identity of Cartman's father, but was in fact an April Fools' Day joke on the creators' part: \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", an entire episode revolving around the two title characters. The April 1 episode was supposed to be a one-off, with the rest of the season starting in May. However, following overwhelmingly negative fan reaction, the episode resolving the Cartman's father storyline, \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\", was moved from its planned May 20 air date to April 22. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" then started a six-episode run of the season when it was broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on May 20, 1998.\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" was met with favorable reviews. Critics especially praised the episode for its touching moments, in contrast with the off-color humor often employed in the series. In his review of the episode in the \"Chicago Tribune\", Allan Johnson praised the episode, especially in comparison with the first two episodes of the season, considering it to be one of the better episodes of the series. When the series reached its 100th episode in 2003, the same writer also listed \"Ike's Wee Wee\" as one of the \"top 10 episodes that have made one of the most provocative comedies on TV\". A review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that \"n the midst of all this potty-mouthed humor, there are moments that are downright touching\", and particularly highlighted the ending of \"Ike's Wee Wee\" as an example, explaining that \"all's well in the end, and Kyle and the boys learn a lesson about family values that even Dan Quayle would approve of\". In 2000, visitors of the Comedy Central website chose \"Ike's Wee Wee\" as their favorite episode during a voting called \"\"South Park\" e-Lections\", held around the time of the United States presidential election that year.\n\nMr. Mackey's line, \"drugs are bad, m'kay?\", has entered popular culture. The Eminem song, \"The Kids\" (which is featured on the B-side of the single \"The Way I Am\" and the clean version of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\"), is thematically about drug use, and makes numerous references to \"South Park\" and impressions of the show's characters, including an impression of Mr. Mackey's voice and the repetition of his line. The song \"Hip Hop Quotables\" by Ludacris, from his album \"Chicken-n-Beer\", also contains the line. In 2008, the line was referenced in the dissenting opinion of a judge, in a case of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Also, in a 2010 marijuana-related court case at the Maryland Court of Appeals, Judge Clayton Greene, Jr. referenced the episode in his dissenting opinion, calling Mr. Mackey's words \"immortal\". In 2011, during a judiciary committee hearing about a marijuana-related bill in Denver, Colorado, a representative showed off a potential packaging for edible marijuana products. According to a group called the Cannabis Therapy Institute, the label on the package, which bore the placeholder text, \"Legal and governmentally approved statement describing that pot is bad, M-ok\", was a reference to the \"South Park\" episode.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" was released on VHS in April 1999, along with the episode \"Chickenlover\", on a video titled \"South Park: Volume 8\". The episode saw its first DVD release in December 1999, on a disc called \"South Park: Volume 4\", which also included \"Chickenlover\", as well as \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\" and \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\". \"South Park: The Complete Second Season\" was released on DVD on June 3, 2003. On these home releases, \"Ike's Wee Wee\" has a humorous introduction by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are playing music to the elderly in a retirement home. Episodes of season two have also been released digitally, on services such as Amazon Video, the iTunes Store, and Xbox Live Marketplace. Like most episodes of \"South Park\", \"Ike's Wee Wee\" is available to watch for free on the show's website, SouthParkStudios.com.\n\n"}
{"id": "2215035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215035", "title": "George Andrew Reisner", "text": "George Andrew Reisner\n\nGeorge Andrew Reisner Jr. (November 5, 1867 – June 6, 1942) was an American archaeologist of Ancient Egypt, Nubia and Palestine.\n\nReisner was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents were George Andrew Reisner I and Mary Elizabeth Mason. His father's parents were of German descent. Reisner gained B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University, before becoming a travelling fellow. \n\nHe married Mary Putnam Bronson, with whom he had a daughter, also called Mary.\n\nIn 1889, Reisner was head football coach at Purdue University, coaching for one season and compiling a record of 2–1.\n\nUpon his studies at Jebel Barkal (The Holy Mountain), in Nubia he found the Nubian kings were not buried in the pyramids but outside of them. He also found the skull of a Nubian female (who he thought was a king) which is in the collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard. Reisner believed that Kerma was originally the base of an Egyptian governor and that these Egyptian rulers evolved into the independent monarchs of Kerma.\n\nHe also created a list of Egyptian viceroys of Kush. He found the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, the mother of King Khufu (Cheops in Greek) who built the Great Pyramid at Giza. During this time he also explored mastabas. Arthur Merton (London Times) remarked in 1936 in the aftermath of the Abuwtiyuw discovery that Reisner \"enjoys an unrivalled position not only as the outstanding figure in present-day Egyptology, but also as a man whose soundness of judgement and extensive general knowledge are widely conceded.\"\n\nIn 1902 permission to excavate the Western cemetery in Giza was granted by Gaston Maspero, director of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. The area was divided into three sections, and chosen by lot. The 1902-1905 excavations were financed by Phoebe Apperson Hearst. The southern section was given to the Italians under Ernesto Schiaparelli, the northern strip to the Germans under Ludwig Borchardt, and the middle section to Andrew Reisner.\nHe met Queen Marie of Romania in Giza.\n\nIn Egypt, Reisner developed a new archaeological technique which became a standard in the profession, combining the British methods of Petrie, the German methods of Dorpfeld and Koldewey, his own American practicality and his skill for large-scale organization. Despite later being recognised as a mark of good practice, this technique was at the time controversial, and was criticised as being overly elaborate.\n\nIn 1908, after a decade in Egypt, Reisner headed the Harvard excavation of Samaria.\n\nIn 1913 Reisner was tasked with training the young archaeologist O.G.S. Crawford in excavation techniques, Crawford was later to warmly recall that Reisner was \"an excavator of the first rank\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2215040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215040", "title": "Cat Osterman", "text": "Cat Osterman\n\nCatherine Leigh Osterman (born April 16, 1983) is an American, former collegiate 4-time All-American and 2-time medal winning Olympian, unretired 6-time pro All-Star, left-handed softball pitcher and former softball Assistant Coach originally from Houston, Texas. She completed her college eligibility in 2006 at the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a starting pitcher for the Longhorns since 2002. Osterman pitched on the USA Women's Softball Team which won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the silver medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Osterman holds the Big 12 pitching Triple Crown for leading in career wins, ERA, strikeouts, as well as shutouts, no-hitters, WHIP and perfect games, additionally claiming the NCAA Division I record for strikeout ratio (14.34). In the National Pro Fastpitch, Osterman is the career leader in strikeout ratio (10.90) and no-hitters (6). She owns numerous other records for the Longhorns and within the NCAA Division I, where she is also one of five pitchers to strikeout 1,000 batters with 100 wins, an ERA of under 1.00, and averaging double digit strikeouts. Osterman currently is a member of Team USA softball that has qualified for the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics. In May of 2020, she also signed to join a new softball pro league under Athletes Unlimited that will begin play in the fall. Osterman was also named #3 Greatest College Softball Player.\n\nShe started playing softball in first grade before quitting to play soccer and basketball. Osterman found her way back to the diamond in fifth grade, when she was filling in as a backup pitcher for a little league team.\n\nOsterman was born in Houston, Texas to parents Gary and Laura Osterman. Her younger brothers are Craig and Chris. She attended Cypress Springs High School in Cypress, Texas from 1997 to 2001, where she set several records on the school's softball team.\n\nIn 2001, she struck out 33 batters in a 14-inning 1–0 shutout over Cy-Fair High School. The performance ranked 16th on the list of strikeouts in a single game. As such, she set a national record for strikeouts in a game less than 20 innings, beating Jenny Stallard's previous record of 31 in 19 innings in 1978; she also set a national record for strikeouts in a 14-inning game, breaking Michele Granger's former record of 31 in 1985.\n\nOsterman was named a National Fastpitch Coaches' Association Second Team All-American. She was also named Big 12 First Team and \"Pitcher of The Year.\" She broke and set UT single-season records for wins (led the NCAA), innings pitched, games started, shutouts, strikeouts, strikeout ratio (led the NCAA) and appearances. Currently only her inning pitched and games started remain top season records from this year. Her freshman ERA was and is a top-5 school record. Osterman also set the UT single-game record for innings-pitched (14) and single game strikeouts. She also tied the UT single-season record for complete games.\n\nOsterman debuted on February 6, tossing six shutout innings, allowing two hits and fanning 11 of the Texas A&M–Corpus Christi Islanders. In a March 20 no-decision against the Texas State Bobcats, she struck out 24 in over 10-innings for a career best. That game also was and is a top-5 NCAA record for combined strikeouts at 34, which she shares with Nicole Neuerburg and tied Osterman fourth for an individual pitcher's total in a single game all-time.\n\nOsterman became the first UT freshman to be named Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Week, for the week of February 19, in which she threw two no-hitters. The first, a 3–0 win over the Utah Utes on February 13 and then a 4–0 win over the Texas State Bobcats on February 15. They were only the third and fourth no-hitters by a UT freshman, and Osterman became only the second Longhorn pitcher to accomplish the feat, along with Natalie King in 2001. She also threw the first perfect game in UT history in a game against Stephen F. Austin State Lumberjacks on February 26. She proceeded to throw two more in her freshman season to match and set two all-time NCAA Freshman Class records for season no-hitters (5) and perfect games (3), the latter record has since been surpassed.\n\nOsterman repeated honors as an All-American, now a First Team selection, as well as Big 12 \"Pitcher\" and \"Female Athlete\" of The Year. She also earned her first USA Softball National Collegiate Player of The Year Award. Osterman threw 4 no-hitters and a perfect game, while breaking her own UT records for ERA, shutouts and strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Sophomore Class record), of which she also led the NCAA in, except shutouts; the strikeout ratio was a new NCAA season record. She also tied her own shared record for complete games and posted career records in wins (68), shutouts (35), strikeouts (1,042), and opponents-batting-average (.105).\n\nFrom April 22 – May 22, she pitched a career high and UT record 65 consecutive scoreless innings. The streak began with a win against the Texas A&M Aggies and was broken in a 3–2 win over the ULL Ragin' Cajuns; the streak ran over 12 games (7 complete) and 11 wins and included 115 strikeouts, 16 hits and 9 walks. Osterman is so far the second pitcher in NCAA history to strike out 1,000 batters in only two seasons and in that very same game on May 22, during the Women's College World Series vs. the ULL Ragin' Cajuns, she struck out 11 to reach the milestone. Osterman also is noted for just needing over 500 innings pitched to get into the club, the fewest of any NCAA Division I pitcher.\n\nWith that win, Osterman and the Longhorns the next day advanced to meet the California Golden Bears, whom Osterman shutout with 17 strikeouts to tie Lisa Ishikawa's WCWS record for a single game performance. In a doubleheader on the 25, the Longhorns lost to the UCLA Bruins in back-to-back games and were eliminated. Osterman was named to the All-Tournament Team for her efforts.\n\nOsterman redshirted from UT to participate with fellow college softball pitcher Jennie Finch in the Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nOsterman went undefeated in 24 appearances during the USA Softball National Team's 53-game schedule. On February 20, she struck out 9 batters in four perfect innings and combined with Finch for a no-hitter. On May 17, she struck out 7 of 9 batters over three innings, after which Finch struck out the final six batters in a row to combine for a perfect game and defeat the Sonic Stars, 10–0. On July 10, she struck out 13 batters over 5-innings for another no-hitter, this time missing perfection on a lone error by first-baseman Stacey Nuveman in a 16–0 win over the Fort Worth All-Stars.\n\nOsterman picked up two wins and a save in the Olympiad. She followed Finch and Lori Harrigan of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas by striking out the final two batters in Team USA's 7–0 victory over Italy on August 14; she gave up one hit and struck out 11 batters over 8-innings in Team USA's 3–0 victory over Japan on August 16; and she gave up one hit and four walks while striking out 10 batters over 6-innings in Team USA's 3–0 victory over Chinese Taipei on August 20. Her 23 strikeouts led Team USA.\n\nOsterman received her second First Team All-American citation and repeated honors from the Big 12 and USA Softball. She also added the Honda Sports Award for softball that year as well. Osterman was named the 2005 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women's Sports Foundation. She also topped her previous UT single-season records for ERA (career best), strikeouts, strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Junior Class record), shutouts, opponents batting average and complete games. The opponents BA remains the school record and Osterman again led the NCAA in ERA and strikeout ratio in addition; the ratio was another new all-time record. Finally, she set Big 12 records in ERA, strikeouts and opponents batting average, of which only the strikeouts has been surpassed. She finished the season at third place on the all-time NCAA single-season strikeout list.\n\nOsterman threw 6 no-hitters (an NCAA top-5 season record) and three more perfect games (another NCAA top-3 and Junior Class season tying record) while setting a career best WHIP. Osterman was and is still the only pitcher to have two three perfect game seasons, including 2002. On February 27, Osterman combined with Anjelica Selden of the UCLA Bruins to strike out 31 batters in an 8-inning win for the Longhorns. She also struck out 20 or more batters in four separate games, one of which came on March 17 vs. the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats; Osterman struck out 23 in a 10-inning shutout. The game tied her combination strikeouts record of 34, this time with Alicia Hollowell.\n\nBeginning on March 4, the Longhorn posted a career best 24.2 consecutive hitless innings when she surrendered a first-inning hit to the Evansville Purple Aces to open a three-game series before shutting them down for the rest of the game. The next day, Osterman threw the final 1.2 innings by striking out all batters faced in an eventual win for the Aces. On March 9, Osterman struck out her 1,200th batter to tie Lisa Ishikawa of Northwestern University for 10th place on the NCAA all-time strikeout list; the victory was also her sixth career perfect game. On March 11, she moved past Ishikawa and passed Jocelyn Forest of the University of California, Berkeley to take ninth place with a second consecutive no-hitter against the UTEP Miners. Finally, on March 14, Osterman came on in relief vs. the UCLA Bruins and retired the first five batters before the streak ended with a sixth-inning leadoff single. Overall, Osterman allowed only two walks and struck out 64 batters in four wins over 5 games during the streak.\n\nOn March 15, she reached 1,229 to surpass Amanda Renfro of Texas Tech for eighth place; on March 17, she passed Shawn Andaya of Texas A&M to take seventh place. On March 23, she struck out her 1,291st batter, passing Sarah Dawson of the University of Louisiana at Monroe for sixth place. On March 25, Osterman became the sixth NCAA Division I pitcher to strikeout 1,300 batters. On April 6, she passed Danielle Henderson for fifth place on the NCAA all-time strikeout list; on April 10, she struck out 7 in 3.1 innings to surpass Britni Sneed for fourth place. On April 13, she passed Nicole Myers to take third place; on April 16, she struck out 13 in a 3–2 win over the University of Missouri to become the third member of the 1,400-strikeout club (along with Michele Granger and Courtney Blades). Later she would again whiff 24 to match her own school record vs. the Texas Tech Red Raiders and along with Erin Crawford combined for another 31 strikeouts on April 26. On May 12, she crested the 1,500-strikeout plateau; on June 3, she broke the 1,600-strikeout mark.\n\nOn June 2, Osterman opened her WCWS by matching her shared record with 17 strikeouts vs. the Alabama Crimson Tide. The team eventually lost to the UCLA Bruins on June 5, who in turn lost to the eventual champions the Michigan Wolverines, to whom the Longhorns had also lost to earlier in the tournament. Osterman and Alicia Hollowell set a new WCWS record for combined strikeouts at 30 in their 11-inning battle; Osterman was named All-Tournament.\n\nOsterman earned honors for a final time from the NFCA, Big 12 and USA softball. Again Osterman also collected her second Honda Award. She broke and set her final set of Longhorn records in wins, strikeouts, shutouts and strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Senior Class record), all were career highs. Osterman became one of the first pitchers to have three 500-strikeout seasons to her credit. For a fourth time in her career, Osterman led the NCAA in ERA and strikeout ratio, setting a new all-time season record in the latter category at 15.4. These would help her to a Big 12 pitching Triple Crown for the best in wins, ERA and strikeouts for that year.\n\nOsterman pitched 5 no-hitters (NCAA top-5 season record) and opened the season with six consecutive shutouts, including an opening day no-hitter and a 16–0 romp over the Oklahoma Christian Lady Eagles. On February 11 she won her 100th career game, 3–0, against the Northwestern Wildcats in shutout fashion.

It premiered on Disney Channel on May 15, 1999.\n\nCody Griffin is an adopted teenager; his birth mother is a mermaid who left him on the Griffins' boat when he was a baby to avoid being captured. As she left, she was spotted by Mr. Wheatly, a fisherman who became obsessed with finding mermaids. Years later, Cody establishes himself as a quick swimmer on his school's swim team, and he has a girlfriend named Samantha. He is under a lot of pressure from a big swim meet coming up and because he is failing biology, he is partnered with Jess Wheatly, the class geek who is a marine biology expert.\n\nAfter Cody's 13th birthday, he begins to feel strange. As he wakes up in the morning, he turns off his alarm clock and zaps it. Ignoring it, Cody drinks from a milk container, which he notices is stuck to his hand; he later also drinks large amounts of water. He goes to Jess for help, who agrees to figure out what is going on with him as long as Cody teaches him to swim in return. Jess runs various tests, learning Cody can generate electricity, climb walls, talk to fish, swim extremely fast, and when sometimes wet, scales appear on his hands and arms. Jess concludes that Cody is turning into a merman.\n\nDespite all the odd things happening to him, as well as the objection of his adoptive parents when they find out, Cody decides to attend the swim meet. He not only wins the meet and beats his teammate Sean, but breaks the state speed record, with his scales appearing. Sean sees the scales and surmises Cody cheated, following him into the locker room. Cody avoids him by sticking to the ceiling, but Sean is determined to find out how Cody cheated. Cody safely makes it out of the school and goes home with his parents after they find out he was not in his room; however, the scales are lasting longer now.\n\nCody tries calming his parents by claiming nobody saw his scales, but Jess shows up and tells them he saw everything and that people are talking about Cody. Samantha arrives and faints at the sight of Cody's scales. When she awakens, she is freaked out. Cody tells her he is still the same guy and to not be afraid. While sworn to secrecy for Cody's safety, Samantha is disturbed by the discovery and leaves. The next morning Cody takes a swim, and meets his mermaid mother; however, Jess's father, who is the obsessed fisherman, spots them and ends the reunion.\n\nLater that day, Cody meets Samantha at the beach. She apologizes and they kiss. Cody then walks into the water with her, saying there's something he wants to show her. Cody's mermaid mother appears; however, Cody suddenly gasps in pain and stumbles back to the shore. Writhing on the ground, he tells Samantha to get his parents. After she leaves, Cody's feet turn into flippers. Thinking Samantha came back, Cody is surprised when someone throws a blanket over him.\n\nJess comes down to where Cody is, but sees he is gone. He then sees his father's boat and panics because his father had seen Cody's fins at the swim meet earlier. Jess's father is planning on using Cody to lure in his mother to prove he is not crazy for believing in mermaids. Jess comes on board the boat, and Cody asks him for help. Despite trying to warn the mermaid away, Cody and Jess are unable to stop a fishing net from trapping her. Cody asks Jess to help his mother, so he takes a knife and jumps into the water to cut the net. He frees the mermaid, but his leg gets caught in the net, pulling him under. Jess passes out, but Cody jumps in and brings him to the dock where Jess's father, Cody's parents, and Samantha are. Samantha performs CPR, but is unsuccessful. Cody decides to zap Jess's heart, which successfully makes Jess come to.\n\nCody's mermaid mother shows up again. She discovers her son is still alive and watches him and his family from afar. Cody explains she wants him to go with her because she is the only one who can help him with his changes. Cody's adoptive mother does not want him to leave, but the mermaid telepathically promises to send Cody back before school starts. After goodbyes, Jess asks Cody to tell him and his dad about the aquatic life he sees, and Samantha makes Cody promise not to betray her by falling for mergirls. After saying goodbye, Cody and his mother swim off into a life below the surface.\n\n\n\"The Thirteenth Year\" was the film debut of lead actor Chez Starbuck, who had previously only acted in a few commercials, and had served as an anchor of a local children's news program for KLAS-TV in his hometown of Las Vegas. The film was shot over a six-week period in southern California. Starbuck was advised by an acting coach for each day of filming. The ocean scenes were primarily shot in the Newport Beach communities of the Balboa Peninsula and Corona del Mar. Cody's house was filmed at Point Fermin Light in San Pedro, California.\n\n\"The Thirteenth Year\" premiered on Disney Channel on May 15, 1999. It was Disney Channel's second highest-rated film up to that point. A promotional tour for the film took place across a dozen cities during summer 1999. The film was released on VHS on January 23, 2001.The film is currently available for viewing on Disney+.\n\n\"The Post-Standard\" stated that while the film was not as entertaining as the 1984 mermaid film \"Splash\", it \"has a good pace and a few laughs,\" although it was noted that Starbuck's \"stiff\" performance \"dampens some of the movie's charm.\" In June 2011, Stephan Lee of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the film a \"heartwarming and somewhat creepy tale of growing up, leaving the nest, and of course, being yourself\". In 2012, \"Complex\" ranked the film at number 17 on the magazine's list of the 25 best Disney Channel Original Movies. In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider ranked each DCOM released up to that point, placing \"The Thirteenth Year\" at number 16 and calling it an \"indisputable DCOM classic\". That month, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it at number 7 on a list of the top 30 DCOMs.\n"}

{"id": "2215058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215058", "title": "Jean Théodore Delacour", "text": "Jean Théodore Delacour\n\nJean Théodore Delacour (26 September 1890 – 5 November 1985) was an American ornithologist of French origin. He was renowned for not only discovering but also rearing some of the rarest birds in the world. One of the birds he discovered was the imperial pheasant, later found to be a hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant and the silver pheasant.\n\nDelacour was born in Paris into a wealthy family and grew up on the family estate at Villiers near Amiens where he was fascinated by the orchids and ornamental birds in the castle park. With the money he received from his parents, he established a private zoo in Picardy. He attended good schools in Paris where he spent time in the natural history museum and received a doctorate in biology from the Université Lille Nord de France. He served in the French Army during the First World War, a war which devastated the family estate, as well as killing his only surviving brother. He was so shocked by the inhumanity that he swore not to have a family and moved to England for its peace. He however decided to return to France and bought the Chateau Clères in Normandy where he set about making a menagerie. It was so well known that the 9th International Ornithological Congress was held in 1938 in the nearby town of Rouen. One of the visitors to his aviary was the Governor General of the French colony of Indochina. On his invitation, he went on numerous scientific expeditions to Indochina, particularly Vietnam, as well as to Venezuela, the Guianas and Madagascar.\n\nDuring the Second World War Chateau Clères was bombed by the German Luftwaffe on 7 June 1940. Most of his library, animals in his collection and the castle were destroyed. He escaped and was saved by Belgians and Frenchmen and he escaped to Vichy. Erwin Stresemann, a good friend and admirer of Delacour heard of the fate of the zoo and attempted to ensure the safety of the remaining animals through the Wehrmacht. Delacour meanwhile fled through Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier and Lisbon, reaching New York on Christmas Day 1940. His American friends found him a job at the Bronx Zoo and the Museum of Natural History at New York. Delacour lived in the United States, working as a technical adviser for the New York Zoological Society (now known as the Wildlife Conservation Society) as well as on avian systematics at the American Museum of Natural History. In 1952 he became director of the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science and Art, retiring in 1960. After the war ended he divided his time seasonally, spending every summer from 1946 at his estate at Clères where he rebuilt his zoo. It was opened in May 1947 with the French Prime Minister taking part in the inauguration. The collection was eventually donated to the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in 1967.

She was appointed to the court in 1976 by Governor Patrick Lucey, becoming the first female justice to serve on Wisconsin's highest court. Abrahamson was re-elected to the Supreme Court in 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2009. She became the court’s first female Chief Justice on August 1, 1996 and served in that capacity until April 29, 2015.\n\nAbrahamson initiated a federal legal challenge seeking reinstatement as Chief Justice. On May 15, 2015 U.S. District Judge James Peterson denied her request to be reinstated as chief justice. Her appeal of this decision was dismissed on July 31, 2015 and she withdrew her lawsuit on November 10, 2015. She served as a Justice for 43 years, the longest term in the Court’s history.\n\nAbrahamson was born and raised in New York City, where she attended Hunter College High School. She earned an Bachelor of Arts \"magna cum laude\" from New York University in 1953, a Juris Doctor with high distinction from Indiana University Law School in 1956, and a Doctor of Juridical Science in American legal history from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1962.\n\nAbrahamson practiced law in Madison, Wisconsin for 14 years and was a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School. She was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1976 by Governor Patrick Lucey, becoming the first woman to serve on Wisconsin's high court. She became the court’s first female Chief Justice on August 1, 1996 and served in that capacity until April 29, 2015. She served as a Justice for 43 years, the longest term in the Court’s history.\n\nAbrahamson has authored more than 450 majority opinions and participated in more than 3,500 written decisions of the court. She has been involved in deciding more than 10,000 petitions for review, bypasses, certifications and lawyer and judicial discipline cases.\n\nShe is a member of the Council of the American Law Institute and serves on the board of directors of the Dwight D. Opperman Institute of Judicial Administration at New York University School of Law. She has been president of the Conference of Chief Justices and chair of the Board of Directors of the National Center for State Courts and has served on the Board of Visitors of several law schools. She served as a member of the United States National Academies Committee on Science, Technology and Law, and was chair of the National Institute of Justice Committee on the Future of DNA Evidence.\n\nIn 1997 she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1998 she was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, two scholarly societies in the United States. She is a member of the Wisconsin Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2004 she was awarded the first annual Dwight Opperman Award for Judicial Excellence by the American Judicature Society. She has received the Margaret Brent Award from the American Bar Association.\n\nShe has received numerous other awards and fifteen honorary degrees from universities and colleges across the U.S. She is featured in \"Great (Top 100) American Judges: An Encyclopedia\" (2003), \"The Lawdragon 500 Leading Lawyers in America\" (2005), and \"The Lawdragon 500 Leading Judges in America\" (2006). She won re-election on April 7, 2009, defeating Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Randy Koschnick.\n\nIn April, 2015 voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that changed the way that the chief justice of the Supreme Court was selected. Previously the justice with the most seniority held the position, but the amendment allowed court members to choose the chief justice. On April 29, 2015, the day the vote canvass was certified by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, the justices elected Justice Patience D. Roggensack as the new chief justice. According to Abrahamson's own opinion in the 2002 case, State v. Gonzalez, \"\"[U]nless a constitutional amendment provides otherwise, it takes effect upon the certification of a statewide canvass of the votes,\" Since that date, as there is no wording in the amendment saying it should not take effect after the canvass, and no stay or temporary restraining order on the amendment, Justice Roggensack became the Chief Justice, and she has acted in that position in court business since then.\n\nAbrahamson filed a federal lawsuit challenging the immediate implementation of the constitutional amendment, contending that she should remain chief justice until the expiration of her current term in 2019. Her lawsuit was heard on May 15, 2015. Five of the seven justices asked the federal judge to dismiss Abrahamson's lawsuit. That day, the federal court denied Abrahamson's request for immediate reinstatement as Chief Justice. U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson determined there was no harm in Roggensack serving as chief justice while Abrahamson's lawsuit continued.\n\nOn May 27 she appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. However, she dropped the lawsuit on November 10, after deciding that, no matter what happened in her lawsuit, her term would be close to ending by the time the litigation finally ended.\n\nOn May 30, 2018, Abrahamson announced she would not seek re-election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019. She served for 43 years, the longest term in the Court’s history.\n\nAbrahamson and her husband, Seymour, were married for 54 years; they had one son.\n\nin August 2018, Abrahamson announced she was diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer and would finish the remainder of her term which ended in 2019.\n\n\n"}

The song, released in 1970, hit #2 on the UK singles chart and #4 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart. \"All Right Now\" originally appeared on the album \"Fire and Water\", which Free recorded on the Island Records label, formed by Chris Blackwell. In 1991, the song was remixed and re-released, reaching #8 on the UK singles chart.\n\n\"All Right Now\" was a #1 hit in over 20 territories and was recognised by ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) in 1990 for garnering 1,000,000 plus radio plays in the U.S. by late 1989. In 2006, the BMI London awards included a Million Air award for 3 million air plays of \"All Right Now\" in the USA.\n\nAccording to drummer Simon Kirke, \"All Right Now\" was written by Free bassist Andy Fraser and singer Paul Rodgers in the Durham Students' Union building, Dunelm House.\nHe said: \"'All Right Now' was created after a bad gig in Durham. We finished our show and walked off the stage to the sound of our own footsteps. The applause had died before I had even left the drum riser. It was obvious that we needed a rocker to close our shows. All of a sudden the inspiration struck Fraser and he started bopping around singing 'All Right Now'. He sat down and wrote it right there in the dressing room. It couldn’t have taken more than ten minutes.\" Fraser has agreed largely with this history.\n\n\n\"All Right Now\", recorded by Mike Oldfield (produced by Tom Newman), with vocals by Wendy Roberts, Pierre Moerlen and Tom Newman, was issued as a one-sided promotional blue 7\" single flexi-disc in 1979. The single was given only to Virgin Records executives and never issued to the public, making it one of the most elusive collectors' items in the Oldfield catalogue (number Virgin TT-362).\n\nAlso in 1979, studio disco group Witch Queen released a disco version of the song, as a double A-side with a cover of T. Rex's \"Bang a Gong\". It peaked at number eight on the US Billboard disco chart.\n\nSince 1972, \"All Right Now\" as arranged by the Stanford Band has been the \"de facto\" fight song of Stanford University athletic teams.\n\nAmerican soul singer Lea Roberts recorded the song on her 1975 album \"Lady Lea\" (United Artists UA-LA418-G).\n\nRod Stewart recorded the song and released it as a single in the U.S., reaching #72 in the winter of 1985.\n\nPepsi & Shirlie recorded the song as a single (#50) and an album (#69) of the same name in 1987.\n\nLemonescent had a cover version of that song reaching #7 in Scotland and #37 in the UK in 2004 before the group was disbanded.\n\n\n"}

It flows for almost due west into the Chattahoochee River just south of Vinings.\n\nPeachtree Creek is an important part of the area history. Fort Peachtree was built near the creek and the Chattahoochee River to guard against the Cherokee, who were in the Cherokee County territory northwest of the river.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Battle of Peachtree Creek was a major battle of the Atlanta Campaign. Pace's Ferry was built across the river near the creek, and Paces Ferry Road still runs roughly parallel to the creek. Another street, Peachtree Battle Avenue, runs in a similar fashion. Because it is usually called just Peachtree Battle (even by GDOT on its overpass of Interstate 75), that part of Buckhead is often called the same, which in turn gave rise to a local play called \"Peachtree Battle\".\n\nIts two major tributaries are the North Fork Peachtree Creek and the South Fork Peachtree Creek. The northern fork begins at the edge of Gwinnett County and flows southwest, almost perfectly parallel to Interstate 85 through DeKalb County. It ends at its confluence with the southern fork, next to where the highway meets Georgia 400. The southern fork, long, begins in Tucker and flows south then west, passing through Clarkston, then crossing under part of the Stone Mountain Freeway and quickly back again, west (inside) of the Perimeter. It then flows twice through the northern part of the campus of Emory University and its Wesley Woods section. The southern edge of its basin borders the Eastern Continental Divide, including Peavine Creek (which ends next to WAGA-TV) and its tributary Lullwater Creek, which originates in the Lake Claire neighborhood of Atlanta and drains Fernbank Forest and the Druid Hills Golf Club north of Ponce de Leon Avenue. Other major nearby creeks in Atlanta include Nancy Creek (which flows into Peachtree Creek just before the Chattahoochee River), and Proctor Creek (which flows directly into the Chattahoochee).\n\nSince 1912, the stream gauge on Peachtree Creek (\"AANG1\") has been located where it crosses Northside Drive just east of Interstate 75, just northwest of the Brookwood Split (where Interstate 85 leaves 75). It is located at , at above mean sea level. A rainfall puts approximately 1.5 billion gallons or almost 6 billion liters into the watershed, by USGS calculations. That watershed (above the gauge only) is . There is also water quality monitoring equipment there, all transmitted to GOES weather satellites and back down to the USGS in real time. Prior to this current system, daily flow and water quality sampling were done as far back as 1958 and 1959, respectively. Records for this site are maintained by the USGS Georgia Water Science Center.\n\nFlood stage is depth, and due to the heavy urbanization in the area, it often reaches above this mark during heavy storms. Peachtree Creek suffered massive flooding after Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. Late on September 16, 2004, it reached a stage of , a flow of 14,200 cubic feet (106,223 gallons) or 402 cubic meters (402,100 liters) per second, and a width of , its highest official flood record ever, which actually washed away its gauge. The creek was about ten times its normal width, three times its normal speed, and 300 times its normal flow.\n\nThe worst flood ever occurred in 1919, when on January 29 (1/29) or December 9 (12/9) it reached a flow of about 21,000 cubic feet (160,000 gallons) or 600 cubic meters (600,000 liters) per second, and a stage of . Another flood occurred in 1912 just above the 2004 event, and another in 1915 just below it. (Prior to the 1940s, there are no records for depth.) Base flow for the stream is about per second, and a depth of about .\n\nThe 2009 Atlanta floods set new records for most streams in the area, and Peachtree Creek at Northside Drive came a close second place, reaching a height of on September 21, 2009 at 9:15 pm, and causing water to flow over the bridge. The North Fork reached a record of at 7:15pm, topping the previous record of in September 2004. The South Fork reached its third-highest ever at 5:45pm, the record being a flood that brought it to on March 16, 1976.\n\nThe other stream gauges are \"SPJG1\" on the South Fork \"near Atlanta\" at Johnson Road since April 2003, and \"NPBG1\" also \"near Atlanta\" on the North Fork at Buford Highway since May 2003, with another (\"NFPG1\") on the North Fork further up \"near Doraville\" at Graves Road since June 2001.\n\nOn October 2017, future plans were released for the Peachtree Creek Greenway that will run along Peachtree Creek. Construction on the first section of the Greenway began in late 2018 in Brookhaven, GA. The goal of the greenway is to provide residents with close-to-home and close-to-work access to bicycle and pedestrian trails, serve transportation and recreation needs, and help encourage quality of life and sustainable economic growth. The trail will connect the cities of Atlanta, Brookhaven, Chamblee and Doraville.\n\n"}

{"id": "2215084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215084", "title": "Herrin massacre", "text": "Herrin massacre\n\nThe Herrin massacre took place on June 21–22, 1922 in Herrin, Illinois, in a coal mining area during a nationwide strike by the United Mineworkers of America (UMWA). Although the owner of the mine originally agreed with the union to observe the strike, when the price of coal went up, he hired non-union workers to produce and ship out coal, as he had high debt in start-up costs. After an exchange of gunfire by armed guards and union miners, three miners and 20 non-miners were killed, including the superintendent and 19 strikebreakers.\n\nEnraged that the owner had disregarded their agreement, on June 21, union miners shot at strikebreakers going to work, where the mine had armed guards. When striking union members armed themselves and laid siege to the mine, the owner's guards shot and killed three white union miners in an exchange of gunfire.\n\nThe next day, union miners killed superintendent McDowell and 18 of 50 strikebreakers and mine guards, many of them brutally. A twentieth victim from the non-union group was later murdered, bringing the death total to 23.\n\nOn April 1, 1922 the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) began a nationwide strike. W. J. Lester, owner of the Southern Illinois Coal Company, operated a strip mine about halfway between Herrin and Marion, Illinois. Lester at first complied with the strike.\n\nAs he had only recently opened the mine, he had massive startup debts and was willing to negotiate with the UMWA to allow his mine to remain open, as long as no coal was shipped out. Under the agreement, some United Mine Workers members were allowed to continue working during the strike. Lester told an associate that local union leaders were friendly with him; however, he was warned this did not mean he had any control over the ordinary members.\n\nBy June, Lester's miners had dug out nearly 60,000 tons of coal. Strike-driven shortages drove up demand and the price of coal, and Lester figured he could make a $250,000 profit if he sold his coal. He decided to violate the agreement he had made with the union. When the UMWA members working for him objected, he fired all the union workers.\n\nLester brought in mine guards and 50 strikebreakers, who were vilified as \"scabs\" by the union men. They had been recruited by employment agencies in Chicago. On June 16, 1922, he shipped out sixteen railroad cars filled with coal. Testimony later revealed that his mine guards possessed machine guns. They aggressively searched passers-by, and \"they frighten women, they boast and are hard-boiled.\"\n\nLester, responding to a reporter's questions, said his steam shovel operators and the railroad workers were members of their respective unions. John L. Lewis, president of the UMWA, responded in a telegram on June 20. He called the Steam Shovelmen's Union an \"outlaw organization\" that had also provided strikebreakers elsewhere. UMWA members, he said, \"are justified in treating this crowd as an outlaw organization and in viewing its members in the same light as they do any other common strikebreakers.\"\n\nThere was confusion and disagreement between Lewis and William J. Tracy, representative of District No. 1, International Brotherhood of Steam Shovel and Dredgemen (IBSSD). In a widely publicized statement, Lewis said that two representatives of the UMWA had contacted the IBSSD, but \"have failed to secure any satisfaction.\" He did note that the Steam Shovel union had been suspended from the American Federation of Labor, to which the United Mine Workers also belonged. Lewis claimed that the IBSSD was also strikebreaking in Ohio.\n\nTracy responded that though he had sent four individuals to the Herrin site when requested by the owner, they turned away when they saw the guards. He said that no one from his organization was working in Herrin. Tracy also criticized the UMWA for not communicating adequately about the situation.\n\nIt is unclear if Lester was telling the truth, or if he had contacted the IBSSD to disguise the use of non-union workers. To Lewis, it did not matter. Lester's workers were not UMWA members, and the UMWA claimed sole jurisdiction over all coal miners.\n\nLewis' message was printed in newspapers, and miners throughout the region decided to take action. Early in the morning on June 21, a truck carrying Lester's guards and strikebreakers was ambushed near Carbondale, Illinois on its way to his mine. Three men were wounded and six others jumped into the river to escape. Later in the day several hundred union miners rallied in the Herrin cemetery. Lewis' message was read to the crowd, enraging them further.\n\nThe union miners marched into Herrin and looted the hardware store of its firearms and ammunition. At about 3:30 p.m., they surrounded Lester's mine. Lester's guards opened fire, killing two of the UMWA members and mortally wounding a third.\n\nThe mine superintendent, C.K. McDowell, called National Guard Col. Hunter to tell him the mine was surrounded and being fired upon. McDowell said he could not reach County Sheriff Thaxton, and pleaded for troops. Col. Hunter called Thaxton's deputy and told him to ask the Illinois National Guard Adjutant General for troops and to get out to the mine with as many men as possible to stop the attack and break up the mob action.\n\nThaxton's men did nothing. Hunter contacted the adjutant general himself and convinced him to mobilize troops. Lester, who had left the area several days earlier, was reached by phone in Chicago. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he agreed to close the mine for the remainder of the nationwide UMWA strike.\n\nHunter and a citizens' group laid out a plan to get a truce in place — telephoning superintendent McDowell to tell him to raise a white flag, and asking the UMWA sub-district vice president, Fox Hughes, to go to the mine and do the same. The method of getting the guards and nearly 50 strikebreakers safely out of the mine was to be worked out later.\n\nWhen Superintendent McDowell later reported by phone that the shooting had died down, Hunter and the citizens' group were optimistic that a disaster would be avoided. They decided the National Guard troops were not needed after all. Hughes went to the mine with a white flag, but he never took it out or raised it. He later said he had not seen McDowell raise a white flag, so he decided Lester's men had not lived up to the bargain. He went home and did nothing, later claiming he learned that his boss in the UMWA leadership, Hugh Willis, was now involved and decided his role was finished.\n\nDuring the evening, more union supporters stole guns and ammunition, and made their way to the strip mine. McDowell was to have called Hunter when the truce took effect. When Col. Hunter tried to telephone the mine, he found the phone lines had been cut. No law enforcement officers went to the mine, no government officials accompanied Hughes to ensure the white flags were raised, and no troops were activated by the National Guard despite repeated signs that Thaxton could not be counted on to act. No action was taken to enforce a truce.\n\nLate in the evening of June 21, Sheriff Thaxton reluctantly agreed to go to the mine to ensure the truce was carried out, and the superintendent and strikebreakers were given safe passage. Despite being urged to go immediately, he claimed he needed to rest. Thaxton promised to meet Hunter and Major Davis of the Carbondale National Guard company at the sheriff's office at 6 a.m. the following morning.\n\nThat evening, Hugh Willis, the local UMWA leader, spoke to union supporters in Herrin. Willis said of the strikebreakers: \"God damn them, they ought to have known better than to come down here; but now that they're here, let them take what's coming to them.\" Gunfire continued throughout the night, and the mob began destroying equipment to prevent the mine from reopening. They used hammers, shovels, and dynamite to wreck the draglines and bulldozers, while keeping the strikebreakers pinned down inside coal cars and behind barricades.\n\nThe strikebreakers sent out a mine guard, Bernard Jones, with an apron tied to a broomstick. Jones told the mob the men would surrender if their safety would be guaranteed. He was told, \"Come on out and we'll get you out of the county.\" The nearly 50 strikebreakers, guards and superintendent McDowell did as they were told, and the union miners began marching them all to Herrin, five miles away. After about a half mile, the strikebreakers encountered more men waiting at Crenshaw Crossing. One of them shouted, \"The only way to free the county of strikebreakers is to kill them all off and stop the breed!\" The mob grew more agitated and violent as the procession of prisoners continued. Some struck the strikebreakers with the butts of their rifles and shotguns.\n\nBy about half mile past Crenshaw Crossing at Moake Crossing, superintendent McDowell was already bloodied and limping, unable to walk any further. A union man told him, \"I'm going to kill you and use you for bait to catch the other men.\"\n\nHe and another man grabbed McDowell and led him down a side road. Gunshots were heard, and the rest were forced to continue toward Herrin. A farmer later discovered McDowell's body. He had been shot four times – twice in the stomach, and once each in the chest and head. A car drove up to the procession, and a man came out whom some said they overheard being called \"Hugh Willis\" and \"the president.\" According to the accounts of surviving captives, Willis said, \"Listen, don't you go killing these fellows on a public highway. There are too many women and children and witnesses around to do that. Take them over in the woods and give it to them. Kill all you can.\"\n\nThe strikebreakers were taken into the woods, where they reached a barbed wire fence. They were told to run for their lives. A union man shouted, \"Let's see how fast you can run between here and Chicago, you damned gutter-bums!\" The mob opened fire as they ran. Many of the non-union men were caught in the fence and shot dead. Others, making it over the fence but not knowing where they were, ran through Harrison's Woods toward Herrin, a mile further north. One strikebreaker was caught and hanged, and three more were shot to death at his feet. The assistant superintendent of the mine was still alive but unconscious. A union man noticed and shot him in the head. The chase continued into the morning of the 22nd. Six men were shot and killed outside Smith's Garage in the town.\n\nSix strikebreakers were recaptured and ordered to remove their shirts and shoes. They were told to crawl to Herrin Cemetery. By noon a crowd of about 1,000 spectators had gathered at the cemetery. They watched as the strikebreakers were roped together, and union men took turns beating and shooting them. They were also urinated upon. Those still alive at the end had their throats cut by a union man with a pocketknife. Townspeople came to watch and taunt the dead and dying along the route to the cemetery. A reporter tried to give a dying man some water and was told that if he did, \"he wouldn't live to see the next day.\"\n\nSheriff Thaxton had failed to meet Col. Hunter and Major Davis at his office at 6 a.m. as promised; he finally showed up at 8 a.m. By then Hunter and Davis had already heard rumors of the violence against the strikebreakers. When the three finally arrived at the mine, what remained of the operation was in flames, and they learned the mob had left three hours earlier.\n\nWhen they traced the steps of the mob, they found the grisly evidence of the dead, dying, and wounded. Men with injuries were taken to Dr. J. Taylor Black's Herrin Hospital. In total, 19 of the 50 strikebreakers died during the massacre, and another was murdered shortly after. Three union miners had been shot and killed during the siege of the strip mine the first day, bringing the total number of victims to 23.\n\nThe dead strikebreakers were laid out in the Dillard Building in downtown Herrin. Most of the town turned out to look at them. Some gazed quietly, others cursed and spat on the bodies. Sixteen of the 19 strikebreakers killed in the action were buried in the potter's field area of Herrin Cemetery on June 25, 1922. A seventeenth victim was buried in October 1922 after he died following unsuccessful surgery for injuries incurred in the violence. Thousands attended the funerals of the three union miners who were shot and died at the beginning of the siege.\n\nThe nation reacted to the massacre with disgust. One newspaper editorial said \"Herrin, Illinois should be ostracized. Shut off from all communication with the outside world and the people there left to soak in the blood they have spilled.\" President Warren Harding characterized it as a \"shocking crime, barbarity, butchery, rot and madness.\" Others also compared the people of Herrin to the alleged behavior of German troops during World War I.\n\nLester, whose double-dealing had set the tragic events into motion, made a significant profit when the union bought his mine at \"a handsome price\" in order to avoid lawsuits.\n\nAt first, the inquest held by the coroner concluded that all the strikebreakers were killed by unknown individuals, and stated that \"the deaths of the decedents were due to the acts direct and indirect of the officials of the Southern Illinois Coal Company.\" He recommended that the company and its officers be investigated in order to affix appropriate responsibility on them.\n\nTwo trials were held, the first on November 7, 1922, and the second in the winter of 1923. Only six men were indicted for the massacre, and the first two trials ended in acquittals for all the defendants. The prosecution gave up and dismissed the remaining indictments. Otis Clark was the first man to be tried on a total of 214 charges. Two years later, Clark was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. Another of the accused died in a mine accident.\n\nA Williamson County grand jury investigating the incident faulted the Southern Illinois Coal Company for introducing strike breakers and armed guards, and for committing illegal activities such as closing public highways. It criticized the state administration for refusing to take necessary measures once the trouble had begun. Herbert David Croly of \"The New Republic\" criticized the state of Illinois for allowing the Illinois Chamber of Commerce to fund the investigation.\n\nCroly described the retaliation for the deaths of two strikers (the third had been mortally wounded) as \"atrocious\". He noted that while the union miners were likely to escape punishment for killing the African-American strikebreakers, officials who have harmed strikers—such as Major Patrick Hamrock of the Colorado National Guard at Ludlow, or Wheeler after Bisbee—likewise frequently escaped justice. Croly noted that the local government was sympathetic to the union, as was public sentiment. He said that under such circumstances, the union had a responsibility to police its own members.\n\nIn November 2013, eight missing graves of massacre victims were discovered by a research team led by Steven Di Naso, Eastern Illinois University geologist; and Scott Doody, author and historian. By October 2015, the team had determined the last eight graves of victims from the Herrin Massacre. Following the events of June 21–22, 1922, 16 of the victims had been buried in unmarked graves in the potter's field area of Herrin Cemetery. The other three had been claimed by family members after their murders. A seventeenth victim was buried there after he died in October 1922, from injuries suffered during the massacre. For nearly a century, exact burial locations of the victims had been lost. The discovery of the graves provided conclusive answers to the whereabouts of these victims. The team also documented that families had arranged for the remains of five victims to be removed from these graves and reinterred in their hometowns.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the unmarked graves, the city erected a monument in June 2015 at the potter's field area of the Herrin cemetery to recognize and memorialize the 17 massacre victims who were buried here. In November 2015, the city announced that it was ending any more excavations associated with the Herrin massacre project. If family of a victim wanted exploration, they would have to make a specific request to the city council. The research team was satisfied that they have been able to identify the 17 persons buried at the Herrin cemetery from the massacre.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These activities are currently coordinated and organized by the Minnesota State High School League, otherwise known as the MSHSL.\n\nThere are thirteen categories of Minnesota High School Speech, many of which differ greatly from their National Forensics League counterparts. Minnesota High School Speech and Minnesota High School Debate, while both organized by the Minnesota State High School League, are independent activities with different tournament schedules, seasons, awards, and procedures.\n\nMinnesota High School Speech, as organized by the MSHSL, is composed of thirteen highly varied categories both interpretive and public address style.\n\nThe thirteen categories offered are: Creative Expression, Discussion, Duo Interpretation, Extemporaneous Reading, Extemporaneous Speaking, Great Speeches, Humorous Interpretation, Informative Speaking, Original Oratory, Serious Interpretation of Drama, Serious Interpretation of Poetry, Serious Interpretation of Prose, and Storytelling. There are also two categories that were tested in the 2015-2016 season. The two categories were Program Oral Interpretation and Improv. These categories have been confirmed to stay for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn Creative Expression, the speaker presents an original, creative piece. They are judged on writing as well as delivery.\n\nIn Discussion, students are given up to an hour to discuss in a small group, and come to a cooperative agreement or compromise on a given prompt.\n\nIn Duo Interpretation, a pair of speakers present a piece together. Body contact is not allowed and speakers are only allowed eye contact with each other during the introduction and transitions.\n\nIn Extemporaneous Reading, the speaker draws three \"cuttings\" (a portion of a story) from a selection of around twenty short stories or poems. The speaker chooses one of the three to read and is given thirty minutes to practice it, write an introduction, and memorize the introduction.\n\nIn Extemporaneous Speaking, the speaker draws three national or international current event questions, and is given thirty minutes to prepare a seven-minute speech on the drawn topic of their choice.\n\nIn Great Speeches, the speaker presents on a historically great speech, including an analysis and sections of the original speech.\n\nIn Humorous Interpretation, the speaker presents a humorous selection from a play, prose, or poem.\n\nIn Informative Speaking, the speaker presents an original, unbiased speech on the topic of their choice with the purpose to inform. They are also permitted to use posters or other visual aids to enhance their presentation. This the only category where visual aids or props are permitted.\n\nIn Original Oratory, the speaker presents an original speech with the purpose of persuading the audience.\n\nIn Serious Interpretation of Drama, the speaker presents a serious monologue, or selection from a play.\n\nIn Serious Interpretation of Poetry, the speaker presents a serious poem, selection of poems, or portion of a poem.\n\nIn Serious Interpretation of Prose, the speaker presents a serious selection from a novel or short story.\n\nIn Storytelling, the speaker draws three from a selection of fifteen folk tales, and presents their interpretation of it.\n\nIn Improv, the speaker writes a story before the round. Before they speak, they receive a quote and have two minutes to integrate it into their speech.\n\nIn Program Oral Interpretation, the speaker presents a speech that is a combination of at least two of the following categories: Poetry, Prose, and Drama.\n\nThe Minnesota State High School League organizes only three divisions of competitive speech tournaments; all other invitationals and tournaments are organized by schools and teams themselves and are without central coordination.\n\nIndependently organized tournaments, for the most part, adhere to Minnesota State High School League-sanctioned rules, although many schools now host tournaments specifically ruled by those set by the National Forensics League, whose rules and categories differ wildly in many areas.\nInvitational speech meets usually follow a certain form, with three preliminary rounds. The top six, seven, or eight will advance to a final round, which is judged by three judges. If a final round is judged, the final round scores are usually the only scores counted when determining final placement.\n\nThe MSHSL currently divides all Speech teams into two classes:\n\n\nSome sections, either A or AA, chose to run a subsection meet. Others chose to run what is called a \"Supersection\" which is described below.\n\nThe MSHSL currently coordinates three levels of competition:\n\n\nFor many years, if a student had qualified to speak at the State level but was unable to attend, an alternate was used from their section. The rules have been changed to state that\" A. Substitution:\n\nIf a qualified contestant is unable to participate in the State Contest, no alternate contestants will be placed into competition.\"\nIn each round, students typically compete against 5-8 other speakers. The judge will rank each speaker in the round (Note: at invitationals, no ranking lower than a 5 is awarded; 6th, 7th, etc. will receive a rank of 5). The judge will also give each speaker a rate or percentage (typically no lower than 90, but sometimes 85). When scores for placements are being tabulated, the students are first placed by the total of their ranks. The students with the lowest sum of their ranks place highest. If a tie occurs, it is, if possible, first broken by Judge's Preference. If the tied speakers faced each other head to head in a round, the student that ranked higher in the round places highest. If a tie cannot be broken by Judge's Preference (i.e. the speakers never faced each other in a round, or they faced each other more than once with judges disagreeing on their ranks relative to each other), it is then broken by rate. The student with the highest sum of their rates places highest. If the students have equal rates, a tie is then broken using Reciprocals. The speakers' ranks are reciprocated (i.e. 1=1, 2=.5, 3=.33, etc.) and the reciprocals are added. The student with the highest sum of these reciprocals places highest. This places more weight on higher rankings. If a tie is still unable to be broken, the winner will be decided in a coin toss (Or rock, paper, scissors).\n"}
{"id": "2215095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215095", "title": "Rick Adelman", "text": "Rick Adelman\n\nRichard Leonard Adelman (born June 16, 1946) is an American retired professional basketball player and coach. He coached 23 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He served as head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nAdelman was born in Lynwood, California, the son of Gladys (née Olsen) and Leonard Joseph \"L. J.\" Adelman, who were from North Dakota and worked as teachers and farmers. Adelman began his basketball career as a collegiate star at Loyola University of Los Angeles, now known as Loyola Marymount University. In the 1968 NBA draft, he was selected by the San Diego Rockets (now the Houston Rockets) in the 7th round. He played two seasons in San Diego before being taken by the expansion Trail Blazers in the 1970 expansion draft; he then played three seasons in Portland. He also played for the Chicago Bulls, New Orleans (now Utah) Jazz, and the Kansas City/Omaha (now Sacramento) Kings. He ended his playing career in 1975.\n\nFrom 1977 through to 1983, Adelman coached at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Oregon.\n\nHe was then hired by the Portland Trail Blazers (then coached by Jack Ramsay) as an assistant. When Ramsay was fired and replaced with Mike Schuler in 1986, Adelman was retained; when Schuler was in turn fired during the 1988–89 season, Adelman was promoted to interim coach. After leading the team into the playoffs that year (despite a 39–43 record), Adelman was given the coaching position on a full-time basis in the 1989 off-season.\n\nThe next three years were quite successful for Adelman and the Trail Blazers; the team went to the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992 (losing to the Detroit Pistons and the Chicago Bulls respectively) and went to the Western Conference finals in 1991 (losing to the Los Angeles Lakers). Adelman spent two more years with the team, but was dismissed after the 1993–1994 season.\n\nIn 1995, Adelman was hired as the head coach of the Golden State Warriors. He was unable to duplicate his success in Portland, and was fired after only two years with the team.\n\nAfter a year's absence from the sidelines, Adelman was hired by the Sacramento Kings in 1998. Under Adelman's guidance, the Kings were one of the most successful teams in the Western Conference, qualifying for the playoffs every year of his Sacramento career.\n\nDuring the Kings' 2000 playoff run, they met Phil Jackson's Los Angeles Lakers. Adelman questioned Jackson's motivational techniques when it was learned that Jackson compared Adelman to Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn 2002, the Kings made a serious run for the NBA Finals. After clinching the first seed in the competitive Western Conference, the Kings blazed through the opening two rounds but lost to the Lakers in a controversial series with noticeably lopsided officiating in favor of the Lakers.\n\nIn 2006, Adelman (in the final year of his contract) led the Kings to the playoffs. Despite the team struggling early in the regular season, the Kings rebounded and qualified for the playoffs as the #8 seed. Although competitive, they were defeated 4–2 by the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. Adelman's contract with the Kings expired at the end of the 2005–2006 season. On May 9, it was reported by the \"Sacramento Bee\" that his contract would not be renewed. The Kings have yet to reach the playoffs since.\n\nThe Houston Rockets brought in Rick Adelman as their new head coach, five days after the dismissal of Jeff Van Gundy, on May 18, 2007. Van Gundy had taken the Rockets to three playoff appearances in four years with no series wins. In his first season as head coach, Adelman guided the Rockets to a 22-game winning streak from January through March 2008, the third-longest winning streak in NBA history.\n\nIn the 2009 season, the Rockets finished 5th in the West with a 53–29 record. They entered the playoffs without their star shooting guard, Tracy McGrady, due to an injury. Despite this loss, the Rockets defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in six games to advance to the Western Conference Semifinals for the first time since 1997. However, they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, but surprised many people and proved their resilience by taking the series to seven games even though their star center, Yao Ming, had a season-ending injury in Game 3 of that series.\n\nAdelman won his 800th career game, 13th among coaches in NBA history, on March 24, 2008 against his old team the Sacramento Kings.\n\nOn April 18, 2011, Houston Chronicle reported that the Houston Rockets would not give Adelman a new contract, and would part ways after 4 seasons.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, the Minnesota Timberwolves confirmed the hiring of Rick Adelman as their new coach.\n\nOn April 6, 2013, Adelman won his 1000th career game with a victory over the Detroit Pistons, becoming just the 8th coach in NBA history ever to do so. Adelman's victory came in front of a home crowd of 15,311, including his wife, Mary Kay, whom he promptly joined after the game to celebrate the occasion. The win came 24 years, 1 month, and 11 days after his first win with the Trail Blazers (February 26, 1989).\n\nOn April 21, 2014, Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. It was also announced that he would stay with the Timberwolves as a consultant. Adelman ranks ninth in terms of games coached and games won. Despite these accomplishments, he went just 79–78 (.503) in playoff games and advanced to the NBA Finals twice, both times with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1990 and 1992 where they lost to the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls.\n\n"}

As their titles suggest, each compilation consists of interpretations of Bob Dylan penned songs, which the Byrds recorded at different stages of their career.\n\nNeither version of the album reached the charts in the United States or the United Kingdom.\n\nThe original version of \"The Byrds Play Dylan\" was released by Columbia Records in the U.S. in November 1979, and included all thirteen Bob Dylan covers that the band had officially released on singles or albums between 1965 and 1970. The track listing of the original American release did not present the songs in chronological order. For the album's UK and European release in February 1980, the album was reconfigured to present the tracks in chronological order by release date at the request of the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan. This version begins with \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" (the Byrds' debut single) and concludes with a live rendition of \"Positively 4th Street\", taken from the band's 1970 album \"(Untitled)\". The chronological running order used for the European release was retained for all subsequent CD re-issues of the album.\n\nIn 2008, the original thirteen track version of the album was re-released, with its chronological running order intact, under the augmented title of \"Collections: The Byrds Play Dylan\".\n\nIn June 2002, a second compilation bearing the title \"The Byrds Play Dylan\" was released, which expanded considerably on the scope of the original album and included a number of alternate versions and live recordings that had not been released while the Byrds were still together. It also included the Byrds' cover of \"Paths of Victory\", which had been recorded in 1990 by a reunited line-up of the band featuring original members Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman. All of the material on the 2002 edition of \"The Byrds Play Dylan\" had been previously released, either on the Byrds' regular albums, on their singles, as bonus tracks on their remastered CDs, or on \"The Byrds\" box set.\n\nThe original 1979 release of \"The Byrds Play Dylan\" was not, in fact, the first compilation of the Byrds' Dylan covers to have been issued; an earlier, eleven track compilation had appeared in Japan in 1970 under the title \"The Byrds Sing Dylan\". Yet another compilation of the Byrds' interpretations of Dylan's material was released in the UK and Europe as \"The Byrds Play the Songs of Bob Dylan\" in 2001.\n\nAll songs composed by Bob Dylan, except where noted.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2215098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215098", "title": "Colmar Pocket", "text": "Colmar Pocket\n\nThe Colmar Pocket (; ) was the area held in central Alsace, France, by the German Nineteenth Army from November 1944 to February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group (6th AG) during World War II. It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace. During Operation Nordwind in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace. In late January and early February 1945, the French First Army (reinforced by the U.S. XXI Corps) cleared the Pocket of German forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nA German bridgehead on the west bank of the Rhine 40 miles (65 km) long and 30 miles (50 km) deep was formed in November 1944 when the German defenses in the Vosges Mountains collapsed under the pressure of an offensive by the U.S. 6th Army Group. General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army forced the Belfort Gap and destroyed the German IV Luftwaffe Field Corps near the town of Burnhaupt in the southern Vosges Mountains. Soon thereafter, French forces reached the Rhine in the region north of the Swiss border between Mulhouse and Basel. Likewise, in the northern Vosges Mountains, the French 2nd Armored Division spearheaded a U.S. Seventh Army advance, forced the Saverne Gap, and drove to the Rhine, liberating Strasbourg on 23 November 1944. The effect of these two advances was to collapse the German presence in southern Alsace west of the Rhine to a semi-circular-shaped bridgehead centered on the town of Colmar that came to be known as the \"Colmar Pocket\".\n\nApart from Normandy, the areas of France most bitterly defended by the Germans were Alsace and Lorraine. This occurred in part because the Allied surge across France in 1944 was slowed down by logistical difficulties as the Allies reached the easternmost extent of France, but the primary reason for the stout German defenses of these regions is that Alsace and Lorraine were claimed as part of Germany and would be defended as strongly as any other German soil. This perception informed Hitler's decisions of 24 November and 27 November 1944, that committed General Siegfried Rasp's 19th Army to a do-or-die defense of the region around Colmar. On 26 November, the Germans formed Army Group Oberrhein under the command of Heinrich Himmler and tasked his command with the defense of the front between the Bienwald and the Swiss border. Of prime importance to the German defense around Colmar were the bridges over the Rhine at Breisach and Chalampé, since it was over these bridges that supplies were delivered.\n\nThe logistical crisis and heavy combat of autumn 1944 had dulled the fighting edge of Allied forces throughout northwestern Europe, and the U.S. 6th Army Group was no exception. Restricted logistical support imposed limits on the usage of artillery ammunition and the number of divisions the Allies could effectively employ in the front lines. Faulty forecasts for the numbers of infantry replacements needed prevented U.S. rifle companies from maintaining full strength.\n\nOn the part of the French, their replacement system was limited by the amount of training infrastructure they had been able to re-establish since reentering France in August 1944 and was further strained by a controversial French decision to \"whiten\" the French forces in Alsace by sending experienced Senegalese and other colonial troops—exhausted from fighting in Italy—to the south and replacing them with French Forces of the Interior (FFI) troops of varying quality and experience. While the FFI troops were capable of defensive operations, they had to undergo a steep learning curve in order to become effective at offensive operations, particularly where complex activities such as combined-arms operations were concerned.\n\nThus, at the close of November 1944, the French First Army deployed two kinds of units—highly experienced colonial units and \"green\" units that had recently received a large influx of FFI troops. Coupled with a supporting arms structure (artillery, engineers, etc.) that was weaker than that of other Allied field armies, the sag in French First Army troop proficiency allowed the Germans to hold the Colmar Pocket against an unsuccessful French offensive from 15–22 December 1944.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1945, the Germans launched \"Unternehmen Nordwind\" (Operation \"North Wind\"), one objective of which was the recapture of Strasbourg. German troops of the 198th Infantry Division and the 106th Panzer Brigade attacked north out of the Colmar Pocket from 7–13 January. Although the defending French II Corps suffered some minor losses during this attack, the French held the front south of Strasbourg and frustrated German attempts to recapture the city. Following the failure of \"Nordwind\", the 6th Army Group was ordered to collapse the Colmar Pocket as part of General Dwight D. Eisenhower's plan for all Allied forces to close on the Rhine prior to invading Germany. Since the bulk of Allied troops surrounding the Colmar Pocket were French, this mission was assigned to the French First Army.\n\nThe U.S. 3rd Infantry Division had moved into the Vosges Mountains during mid-December to replace the worn-out U.S. 36th Infantry Division and so was already in place to support the reduction of the Colmar Pocket. Realizing the French would need the assistance of additional U.S. troops for the coming battle, General Jacob Devers, commander of the 6th Army Group, arranged for the transfer of a U.S. division from another part of the front. The U.S. 28th Infantry Division duly arrived from the Ardennes front and took up position along the right flank of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. With the 28th Division in the Kaysersberg Valley, the 3rd Division would be able to concentrate for an attack against two German divisions, the 708th \"Volksgrenadier\" and the 189th Infantry. Additionally, a U.S. armored division, the 10th, was scheduled to support the offensive, but as events developed, it was the U.S. 12th Armored Division that was eventually committed to the battle.\n\nThe winter of 1944-45 was uncommonly cold for northwestern Europe. In his \"History of the French First Army\", General de Lattre described the weather in Alsace as \"Siberian\" with temperatures of -20 °C (-4 °F), strong winds, and over three feet (1 m) of snow.\n\nThe Alsatian Plain is flat and offers an attacker practically no cover other than occasional woods. The plain is also a drainage basin for the Rhine and is consequently cut by many streams and drainage canals with alluvium-coated bottoms, making them treacherous for vehicles to ford. Dotting the plain are small villages made up of sturdy masonry houses whose multi-storey construction offered defending troops a commanding view of the surrounding fields.\n\nGeneral Émile Béthouart's French I Corps (French: \"I Corps d'Armée\") attacked on 20 January 1945. The 2nd and 4th Moroccan Divisions had as their initial objective Ensisheim (). The 9th Colonial Division conducted secondary attacks on the right flank of the corps, north of Mulhouse. In support were tanks of the French 1st Armored Division. Attacking in a snowstorm, the French I Corps initially achieved tactical surprise against its opponent, General Erich Abraham's \"LXIII. Armeekorps\". The attack of the French I Corps slowed through the night as German counterattacks began. The difficult weather and terrain coupled with a German defense in depth stymied the French I Corps advance and severely limited its success. The French attack, however, succeeded in drawing German mobile reserves (the 106th \"Panzer\" Brigade and the 654th Heavy Antitank Battalion) and the German 2nd Mountain Division south. However, even this limited success was not without significant cost: one brigade of the French 1st Armored Division, Combat Command 1 (CC1), lost 36 of some 50 medium tanks to land mines. Losses in other tank units were similar.\n\nUnlike most of the terrain on the Alsatian Plain, the terrain the French I Corps fought in was hemmed in by woodlands and urban areas, and so ground was won only slowly in January after the first day of the attack. The 4th Moroccan Mountain Division was able to push only some two miles (3 km) to the northeast in the direction of Cernay (). On the 4th Division's right flank and to the southeast, the 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division enjoyed greater success, pushing almost four miles (6 km) to the northeast in the direction of Wittelsheim (). On the right flank and starting from the city of Mulhouse, the 9th Colonial Division also pushed through the suburbs of Mulhouse and the woods north of the city, with CC1 taking Richwiller () and the 6th Colonial Infantry Regiment liberating Wittenheim (). On 24 January, a German armored counterattack near Richwiller was repulsed by the French colonial troops, with the Germans losing 15 tanks and tank destroyers. Overall, the gains of the French I Corps were greater in the western part (right flank) of its sector of the front, but the Germans in large part succeeded in stalemating the corps' advance.\n\nGeneral Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert's \"II Corps d'Armée\" launched its attack on 22–23 January. The attacking units were the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division and the French 1st March Infantry Division. South of the 3rd Division, the U.S. 28th Infantry Division defended its sector of the front. In reserve was the French 2nd Armored Division.\n\nGeneral John W. O'Daniel's 3rd U.S. Infantry Division attacked to the southeast on 22 January, aiming to cross the Ill River, bypass the city of Colmar to the north, and open a path for the tanks of the French 5th Armored Division to drive on the railway bridge supplying the Germans in the Colmar Pocket at Neuf-Brisach.\nThe division's 7th Infantry Regiment pushed to the south, clearing the region between the Fecht and Ill Rivers. During the clearing operations of the 7th Infantry, Private First Class Jose F. Valdez sacrificed himself at a small railway station near Rosenkranz () to cover the withdrawal of other members of his squad and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The 30th Infantry Regiment moved southeast, crossed the Ill River north of the timber bridge at the Maison Rouge farm, and moved south early on 23 January, capturing the Maison Rouge bridge (). The 30th Infantry then moved south into the Riedwihr Woods (French: \"Bois de Riedwihr\"), toward the towns of Riedwihr () and Holtzwihr ().\nThe bridge at Maison Rouge proved unable to support U.S. tanks (the bridge collapsed under the weight of a tank), and so the 30th Infantry had only minimal antitank capability (bazookas and three 57 mm anti-tank guns) when they were counter-attacked late in the afternoon by German infantry and heavy tank destroyers of the 708th \"Volksgrenadier\" Division and 280th Assault Gun Battalion. Without cover and unable to dig foxholes because of the frozen terrain, the 30th Infantry was forced to withdraw, taking heavy casualties when the withdrawal assumed the character of a rout. The 30th Infantry reformed on the west bank of the Ill but was out of action for three days while it reorganized.\n\nOn 25 January, the U.S. 15th Infantry Regiment followed the course of the 30th Infantry and recaptured the bridge at Maison Rouge. A German counterattack, again supported by heavy tank destroyers, overran an exposed rifle company of the 15th Infantry around 08:00 but was unable to drive on the bridge because of U.S. defensive fire. Later in the day, U.S. engineers erected a bridge over the Ill north of Maison Rouge, and a battalion of the 15th Infantry supported by tanks attacked to the south, finally securing the bridgehead. Over the next two days, the 15th Infantry pushed south toward the towns of Riedwihr and Holtzwihr, entering the Riedwihr Woods. German counterattacks were common, but the U.S. troops were able to parry them with support from tanks and tank destroyers.\n\nOn 26 January, on the south edge of the Riedwihr Woods, a German force of infantry and tanks emerged from Holtzwihr to counterattack Company B of the 15th Infantry. Believing the odds hopeless, Lieutenant Audie Murphy ordered his men to withdraw into the woods. Murphy climbed onto a burning M10 tank destroyer and engaged the Germans with the vehicle's heavy machine gun while calling for artillery fire on his own position. Unable to determine where Murphy was firing from, the German force first became confused and then was bombed by U.S. fighter-bombers that had found a hole in the clouds over the battlefield. Dismayed, the German force retreated back to Holtzwihr, pursued by Lieutenant Murphy. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor. Riedwihr fell to the 15th Infantry on 26 January, and Holtzwihr was taken by the 30th Infantry on 27 January. The 30th Infantry continued south, reaching the Colmar Canal on 29 January.\n\nThe capture of Jebsheim () was necessary to protect the north flank of the 3rd Division's advance. With the 3rd Division advancing ahead of the French 1 March Infantry Division on the 3rd Division's north flank, General O'Daniel committed the U.S. 254th Infantry Regiment (part of the U.S. 63rd Infantry Division but attached to the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division for the duration of operations in the Colmar Pocket) to capture Jebsheim. On 26–27 January, troops of the German 136th Mountain Infantry Regiment defended Jebsheim against the advance of the 254th Infantry. On 28–29 January, Jebsheim was taken by the 254th Infantry, French tanks of Combat Command 6 (French 5th Armored Division), and a battalion of the French 1st Parachute Regiment. Subsequently, the 254th Infantry continued to push east in the direction of the Rhône-Rhine Canal. Meanwhile, the 7th Infantry had moved forward, and along with the 15th Infantry Regiment and French 5th Armored Division tanks, were positioned to drive on the fortified town of Neuf-Brisach, about five miles (8 km) distant from the 3rd Division spearheads.\n\nOn the left flank and north of the U.S. 3rd Division, General Garbay's French 1 March Infantry Division (French: \"1 Division de Marche d'Infanterie\", formerly known as the 1st Free French Division) attacked to the east on 23 January with the Rhine River as their objective. Facing four battalions of the 708th Volksgrenadier Division (part of General Max Grimmeiss' LXIV Army Corps) supported by heavy tank destroyers and artillery, the 1st Division's 1st Brigade fought in conditions similar to that experienced by the Americans to the south. The Germans mounted a defense in depth, using positions in the villages and forests to command the open ground to their front and liberally planting land mines to slow and channelize the French advance. Two battalions of the 708th Volksgrenadier Division counterattacked the French bridgeheads over the Ill River around 17:00 on 23 January but were repulsed. Wishing to avoid dug-in German infantry and armor in the Elsenheim Woods (), General Garbay directed the 1st Brigade to concentrate their advance along the road from Illhaeusern () to Elsenheim. On 26–27 January, the 1st Brigade concentrated on opening this route and skirting the obstacle posed by the Elsenheim Woods, with a key attack into the woods made by the 3rd Battalion of the March Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (\"R.M.L.E.\") on 27 January. At heavy cost, the village of Grussenheim () was taken on 28 January by supporting tanks of the French 2nd Armored Division. Against crumbling German resistance, the French surged forward, taking Elsenheim and Marckolsheim () on 31 January and reaching the Rhine River the following day. In the course of its operations in the Colmar Pocket, the French 1st Division suffered casualties of 220 killed, 1,240 wounded, 96 missing, and 550 trench-foot cases.\n\nNoting the difficult progress of all Allied units against German resistance in the Colmar Pocket, General de Lattre requested reinforcements from the U.S. 6th Army Group. Concurring, General Devers subordinated the Headquarters of the U.S. XXI Corps to the French First Army. General Milburn's XXI Corps took up position between the two French corps on 28 January and assumed command of the U.S. 3rd and 28th Infantry Divisions. Two additional U.S. divisions were also assigned to the XXI Corps - the U.S. 75th Infantry Division and the U.S. 12th Armored Division. Finally, the French 5th Armored Division, 1st Parachute Regiment, and 1st \"Choc\" (commando) Battalion were placed under XXI Corps' command. The XXI Corps was given the mission of capturing the city of Colmar and driving on the bridge at Breisach.\n\nFor their part, the German high command misread the Allied objectives, believing the Allied assault to be a general pressure along the front designed to induce collapse at any given point. Hitler had agreed to a partial withdrawal in the north (the Erstein salient) during the night of 28 January but forbade a general withdrawal over the Rhine. German outposts in the Vosges Mountains were pulled back, but the confusion of the withdrawal and the pressures of the battlefield resulted in many units becoming mixed with one another. While this did not affect the numbers available for combat, it did lower the defensive cohesion of the German units. On 29 January, \"Heeresgruppe Oberrhein\" was dissolved as a headquarters, and the units in the Colmar Pocket were again subordinated to \"Heeresgruppe G\" (Army Group G), under the command of \"SS-Obergruppenführer\" Paul Hausser.\n\nThe 3rd Division continued its south and east sidestepping maneuver. On the evening of 29 January, divisional artillery fired 16,000 105 mm and 155 mm rounds during a three-hour preparation for the assault of the 7th and 15th Infantry Regiments south across the Colmar Canal. The infantry crossed between 21:00 and midnight. After the crossings were secured, engineers began the construction of three Bailey bridges over the canal to enable armored vehicles to cross. The following day, the French armored combat commands CC4 and CC5 (both of the 5th Armored Division) crossed the canal, with CC4 supporting the U.S. 7th Infantry and CC5 supporting the U.S. 15th Infantry. Soon thereafter, the 15th Infantry and CC5 took Urschenheim in a brisk action, while the 7th Infantry was held up in front of Horbourg. The same day, the 254th Infantry attacked east toward Artzenheim with support of the French armored combat command CC6, but the Germans employed artillery support and dug-in Jagdpanther tank destroyers to parry the thrust, destroying six French tanks and four halftracks. Artzenheim was taken by the French II Corps on 1 February.\n\nFighting in the zone of the 3rd Division, the French 1st Parachute Regiment attacked and seized Widensolen early on 31 January. By 17:00, patrols of the U.S. 3rd Division had reached the Rhône-Rhine Canal, some five miles (8 km) southeast from the division's crossing points over the Colmar Canal. On the same day, French CC6 was relieved from attachment to the U.S. 3rd Division, having taken severe losses with only 13 operational tanks in its tank battalion and 30 effectives in its French Foreign Legion rifle company. In its stead arrived a combat command of the French 2nd Armored Division. On 1 February, the 15th and 30th Infantry Regiments moved south along the Rhône-Rhine Canal reaching the area just north of Neuf-Brisach. On 2–3 February, the 7th Infantry drove south along the same canal passing through Artzenheim and taking Biesheim after a bitter day-long battle. Near Biesheim, Technician 5 Forrest E. Peden of 3rd Division artillery dashed through intense German fire on 3 February to summon help for an ambushed infantry unit. Returning on a light tank, Peden was killed when the tank was hit and destroyed. For his heroism, Peden was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nAfter a day spent consolidating its positions, the 3rd Division moved south again on 5 February, taking Vogelgrun the following day. The fortified town of Neuf-Brisach was swiftly entered and taken on 6 February, by the 30th Infantry, with the help of two French children and another civilian, who showed the Americans undefended passages into the town. The Germans, having evacuated what remained of their men and equipment, had destroyed the bridge over the Rhine at Breisach. The taking of Neuf-Brisach marked the end of operations in the Colmar Pocket for the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division.\n\nThe 75th Division entered the front lines on 31 January, between the U.S. 3rd and 28th Infantry Divisions. Attacking on 1 February, the 289th Infantry Regiment cleared Horbourg and the 290th Infantry Regiment advanced on Andolsheim () occupying the town at 14:00 on 2 February. The same day, the 75th Division made diversionary attacks to cover the Allied drive on the city of Colmar, adjacent to the division's western sector. On 3 February, the 75th Division cleared the Forêt Domaniale () and consolidated its gains the following day. Moving again on 5 February, the division overran Appenwihr (), Hettenschlag (), and Wolfgantzen (). On 6 February, the 75th Division reached the Rhône-Rhine Canal south of Neuf-Brisach. This action brought a close to U.S. 75th Infantry Division operations in the Colmar Pocket.\n\nHaving been on the defense to this point in the battle, General Norman Cota's 28th Division was teamed with the French armored combat command CC4 and told to take the city of Colmar. Leading with the U.S. 109th Infantry Regiment on 2 February, the infantry crossed an anti-tank ditch north of the city, while the French armor located a crossing point over the obstacle. This accomplished, the French armor plunged into Colmar reaching the \"Place Rapp\" (Rapp Square) at 11:30. On 2–3 February, the 109th Infantry, the French CC4, 1st Parachute Regiment and commandos cleared the city of Germans. In a symbolic act, the French 152nd Infantry Regiment re-entered Colmar, its pre-war garrison. Pushing south on 3 February the 112th Infantry entered Turckheim () and cleared Ingersheim () to the west of Colmar. Other units of the 28th Division joined the French in blocking German exit routes from the Vosges Mountains. On 6 February, the 28th Division moved eastwards to the Rhône-Rhine Canal on the south flank of the U.S. XXI Corps ending 28th Division participation in the battle.\n\nOn 3 February, the 12th Armored Division moved south through 28th Division lines with the objective of linking up with the French I Corps and splitting the Colmar Pocket. Combat Command B (CCB) seized a bridgehead near Sundhoffen () and CCR advanced on the road between Colmar and Rouffach (). The following day, CCA captured Hattstatt () on the Colmar-Rouffach Road, but CCR found its way blocked by German defenses. On 5 February, CCA entered Rouffach and made contact with the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division of the French I Corps, some 17 days after French I Corps launched its assault. The same day, CCR entered the village of Herrlisheim-près-Colmar (), and so the 12th Armored Division attacked, for a second time, a town named Herrlisheim in Alsace (the battles of the 12th Armored Division in mid-January 1945, at Herrlisheim north of Strasbourg saw several battalions of the division manhandled by German troops in the Gambsheim bridgehead.) Thereafter, during the battle, the 12th Armored Division screened German exit routes from the Vosges Mountains and supported the 28th Division by fire.\n\nAt the start of February, the French I Corps was still clearing scattered German resistance south of the Thur River between Cernay and Ensisheim, both of which were still under German control. The clearing of this area was not completed until 3 February. On 4 February, I Corps assaulted north across the Thur River and, encountering only limited German resistance, the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division was able to push to the southern outskirts of Rouffach. Cernay, abandoned by the Germans, was occupied the same day. The following day, the 4th Moroccan Division linked up with the U.S. 12th Armored Division in Rouffach, and the 9th Colonial Infantry Division attacked Ensisheim, the original corps objective. Hirtzfelden was taken by the 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division on 6 February and the 9th Colonial Division completed the capture of Ensisheim and drove east into the Harth Woods. On 7 February, both the 9th Colonial Division and 1st Armored Division reached the Rhône-Rhine Canal east of Ensisheim. The \"Spahis\" cavalry brigade and the 151st Infantry Regiment cleared the Harth Woods on 8 February while the 1st Armored Division advanced south toward the German bridgehead at Chalampé in addition to linking up with elements of the French 2nd Armored Division at Fessenheim the same day.\n\nDuring this period, the shrinking German presence on the west side of the Rhine was subjected to heavy artillery fire and airstrikes by U.S. and French aircraft. Finally, on 9 February I Corps eliminated the German rearguard at Chalampé, and with no major German forces left on the west bank of the Rhine in the region of Colmar, the Germans blew up the bridge over the Rhine at Chalampé. This signaled the end of Allied operations in the Colmar Pocket and the end of any significant German military presence in Alsace.\n\nIn compliance with General Eisenhower's direction, the Colmar Pocket was eliminated, and the U.S. 6th Army Group stood on the Rhine, from the Swiss border, to a region well north of Strasbourg. The German 19th Army, although not completely destroyed, lost the bulk of its experienced combat troops (only the 708th Volksgrenadier Division escaped somewhat intact) and was forced to reform in Baden, using large infusions of inexperienced \"Volkssturm\" to replace its grievous losses on the plains of Alsace. The Germans left behind 55 armored vehicles and 66 artillery pieces. The elimination of the Colmar Pocket allowed the 6th Army Group to concentrate on Operation Undertone, its assault to penetrate the Siegfried Line and invade Germany, undertaken in March 1945.\n\nFor the fourth time in 75 years, the province of Alsace had changed hands between France and Germany.\n\nAfter the battle, the French granted the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division the right to wear the Croix de Guerre, and the president awarded the division, as an entity, the Distinguished Unit Citation. The U.S. 109th Infantry Regiment (28th Division) was also granted the right to wear the Croix de Guerre.\n\nToday, numerous streets in Alsace are named after Allied commanders and units that fought in the battle, and there are French and U.S. military cemeteries in the area.\n\n"}

Jean-Baptiste Robichaux was in 1798 the first settler from Grand Chipagan to petition the government for title to his land, in 1798; he was the son of an expelled Acadian. \n\nThe location of the town is an ideal spot for fishing, which was its first economic product, as well as exporting timber from further inland. There are also numerous peat bogs in the area, and their exploitation continues to this day.\n\nShippagan is home to campuses of the Université de Moncton and New Brunswick Community College.\n\nThe name originates from the Mi'kmaq \"Sepagun-chiche\", which roughly translates as \"Ducks' transit route\". This name described the immediate region rather than the specific location of the current settlement that inherited the name.\n\nDifferent spellings have been applied over the years. None of the earliest known francophone explorers such as Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain and Nicolas Denys mentions the name Shippagan, which appears in writing for the first time only in 1656 when Ignatius of Paris, a Capucine missionary, wrote to his superiors recommending the establishment of four or five missionary posts, one of which he called \"Cibaguensi\", a Latinised form of Shippagan.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century various orthographies were used for the nearby settlement on the site of what is now Bas-Caraquet, most commonly Chipagan, and this is the name subsequently applied and adapted for modern-day Shippagan. Early English language texts applied the francophone spelling, \"Chipagan\", but from the early nineteenth centuries various anglophone variants were preferred, such as Shipagan, Ship-a-gang, Shipegan, Shippegan, Shippigan and Shippagan.

It is uninhabited, has no fresh water or trees and only sparse vegetation. It was formerly used as a firing range by the Royal Virgin Islands Police, but the opening of the nearby hotel on Peter Island coincided with the decision to build a proper firing range on the island of Tortola. The island is now an uninhabited National Park, with several popular Scuba diving and snorkeling sites.\n\nAccording to an apocryphal story, the pirate Blackbeard marooned his crew on Dead Chest Island as punishment, leaving them with nothing but a cutlass and a bottle of rum each. How many pirates, and how many days, varies according to the source retelling the story. By the end of the month, only a few of pirates were left alive. Because the earliest known references to this story are from the 20th century, it is almost certainly fakelore derived from Robert Louis Stevenson's song \"Dead Man's Chest\", which first appeared in his novel \"Treasure Island\" in 1883. The chorus of \"Dead Man's Chest\" is as follows:\n\nStevenson found the name \"Dead Man's Chest\" among a list of island names in a book by Charles Kingsley and said \"\"Treasure Island\" came out of Kingsley's \"At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies\" (1871); where I got the 'Dead Man's Chest' - that was the seed\". Kingsley had written in \"At Last\": \"Unfortunately, English buccaneers have since then [1493] have given to most of them [the Virgin Islands] less poetic names. The Dutchman's Cap, Broken Jerusalem, The Dead Man's Chest, Rum Island, and so forth, mark a time and a race more prosaic, but still more terrible, though not one whit more wicked and brutal, than the Spanish conquistadores.\" In other words, the song is not based on a former legend, it is entirely new as of 1883 and original with Stevenson. While the two names are not exactly the same (\"Dead Man's Chest\" vs \"Dead Chest\"), the similarities are striking, and there are no other islands named like it in the Virgin Islands, suggesting they are one and the same. If on the other hand the island \"Dead Man's Chest\" referenced by Kingsley in \"At Last\" is not the same as the island known today as \"Dead Chest Island\", then there would be no connection between \"Dead Chest Island\" and Stevenson's song \"Dead Man's Chest\", since Stevenson's song is in reference to Kingsley's island.\n\nIn 1994, a journalist, Quentin van Marle, spent 31 days alone on the island as a voluntary castaway, beating the supposed record of Blackbeard's pirates and in commemoration of the centenary of Robert Louis Stevenson's death.\n\n"}

Nkosi's Haven also provides support for orphans, HIV/AIDS affected or not. It aims to improve the productivity of their residents through providing access to medical care, therapy, education and skill building workshops. The goal is to empower residents while providing a safe, dignified home in hopes that all mothers and children are able to become responsible and contributing members of society.\n\nNkosi's Haven was named after Nkosi Johnson, an AIDS activist who dedicated his life to ensuring that mothers and their children are kept together under the belief that no mother should have to leave her child due to HIV diagnosis. It is a recognized non-governmental organization that is largely funded by international donors and governmental organizations. Funding is allocated to assist accommodations, which include housing, food, water, medication, and hospice care. It also assists with education costs such as school fees, uniforms, and other expenditures. Residents share household tasks among themselves, including tasks such as cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare.\nAt the time of inception, it was the first and only care centre in South Africa that provided residential care for mothers living with HIV/AIDS and their children.\n\n“Through all of the work we do, we ensure that our residents learn how to live with AIDS, not die from it.” Nkosi's Haven has built a home in which residents can live free from prejudice and discrimination against HIV/AIDS and children can grow into self-sufficient and responsible members of society.\n\nNkosi's Haven was named after Nkosi Johnson, a young AIDS activist who died on International Children's Day in 2001. Born Xolani Nkosi, Nkosi was infected with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Nkosi and his mother were admitted to an AIDS care centre in Johannesburg, where they met Gail Johnson, a volunteer worker.\n\nDue to financial restraints, the care centre that Nkosi and his mother were living in closed down. Nkosi's mother's health was deteriorating rapidly and she was unable to keep Nkosi due to her health conditions and financial dependency. She also feared that the community would find out that both herself and Nkosi were HIV positive and exile them. As a result, Gail Johnson took Nkosi into her care, changing his name to Nkosi Johnson, and became his legal foster mother.\n\nGail Johnson attempted to enroll Nkosi into school in Johannesburg and was faced with backlash as soon as Nkosi's HIV status was made public. In 1997, Johnson took the case to court, winning her case and forcing the South African educational system to revise their admittance policies discriminating against children with AIDS.\n\nAfter Nkosi's experience with discrimination due to his health status and the forced separation between him and his mother, Nkosi's dream was to create an HIV/AIDS care centre in which children and their mothers could live freely without prejudice or discrimination because of their health status. With the help of his foster mother, Gail, Nkosi opened Nkosi's Haven in 1999, providing hundreds of mothers and their children with a safe space and communal environment.\n\nNkosi's journey made him the national figure in the fight against AIDS. In July 2000, Nkosi wrote and presented a speech at the 13th International Aids Conference, held in Durban, which was televised worldwide. At 11 years old, he spoke to delegates about his experience growing up with HIV. His fight with HIV birthed his dream to raise awareness and erase the stigma of HIV/AIDS through communal, supportive environments and care centres. Nkosi is most famously known for his quote,\n“We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else- don't be afraid of us- we are all the same!\"\n\nA year before his death, Nkosi suffered through severe brain damage and viral infections due to AIDS. He was bedridden, emaciated, suffering from seizures and unable to eat solid foods. After battling the disease for 12 years, Nkosi Johnson died in his sleep on 1 June 2001.\n\nNkosi was given a hero's burial memorial service in Johannesburg with thousands of attendees paying their respects to the late activist.\n\nAt the time of his death, Nkosi Johnson was South Africa's longest surviving child born with HIV/AIDS. In 2005, he was awarded with the International Children's Peace Prize for his fight against HIV/AIDS and activist efforts. After his death, Nelson Mandela released a statement, recognizing Nkosi as an \"icon of the struggle for life\" who fought fearlessly against HIV/AIDS. He urged everyone to give their support during this time, acknowledging Nkosi as an ambassador for South Africa and its people, especially those living with HIV.\n\nNkosi Johnson's legacy lives on through the work of Nkosi's Haven.\n\nSouth Africa has had high rates of HIV/AIDS diagnoses for years, with approximately 6.19 million accounted individuals living with HIV/AIDS in 2015. Within the age group of adults aged 15–49 years old, 16.6% of that cohort is HIV positive. HIV/AIDS related deaths have been declining as of recent years, with 2005 being the year with the highest number of deaths in South Africa. Thereafter, antiretroviral treatment was administered and easily accessible, changing the patterns of HIV/AIDS and extending the lifespan of many South Africans who would have otherwise died at an earlier age.\n\nHIV/AIDS related illnesses are still high, with an increase of 4.02 million people living with HIV in South Africa from 2002 to 2015. Statistics South Africa approximates that every one out of five South African females in their reproductive ages are living with HIV.\n\nUNAIDS reports that approximately 2.1 million children in South Africa are orphans due to HIV/AIDS related illnesses, with 180,000 deaths occurring in the year of 2015. Women over the age of 15 account for 4 million people living with HIV, and approximately 240,000 children under the age of 14 have been affected by HIV.\n\nEvidence has shown that the HIV/AIDS crisis has had a significant impact on South African family life. Responsibility for children growing up in South African society has been increasingly separate from biological parenthood due to the lack of parental care available. Under many circumstances, children often care for their own families due to the circumstances created by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nIn 1999, Nkosi and Gail opened their first Nkosi's Haven location in Berea, Johannesburg. Despite being close to the city centre, selling properties became increasingly difficult in Berea, with the neighbouring area of Hillbrow beside, as it became an area that was frequented with street children and the unemployed. The 1980s was an era of high crime rates in downtown Johannesburg, which neighboured Hillbrow and Berea. After the apartheid ended in the 1990s, many gangs, along with residents from neighbouring townships, moved into the area making it unsafe. Thus, the property was offered to Gail Johnson, rent free for 5 years.\n\nThe house was located on 23 Mitchell street and consisted of four bedrooms, one bathroom upstairs and one downstairs, a lounge, a room used as a dormitory, and a courtyard. Renovations and repairs were needed, in addition to furniture and basic house necessities. To raise funds for the completion of the house, Gail, a former public relations consultant, held a “kitchen tea” in which a wish list was created and publicized in the media and to those who were potential contributors. At the tea, Gail explained the reasons behind the creation of Nkosi's Haven. She explained that Nkosi's Haven was to offer a kibbutz style of living in which residents would take turns at cooking, cleaning, caring for the children, and helping care for each other as needed. Gail also told the guests that they already reached capacity for residence at the house. At the time, the house fit nine mothers and their children with presumed costs starting at R28,000 monthly. The results of the kitchen tea were successful and Gail managed to fundraise R45,000 worth of furniture and equipment, free electrical services, along with appliances valued at R30,000 for the nursery and dormitory.\n\nAfter 3 years in operation, Nkosi's Haven saw need for a second home as the Berea residence was rapidly expanding with mothers and children living with HIV/AIDS and orphans. In 2002, a separate plot of land was purchased south of Johannesburg. Upon development, both residences catered to over 160 residents and their children providing meals, medication, education, daily necessities for residents living with or without HIV/AIDS, and care for orphans.\n\nDue to financial restraints, in 2012, the NGO sold its property in Berea and moved all occupants to Nkosi's Haven Village in Alan Manor, South of Johannesburg. Costs for operating the Berea house were as much as R150,000 to R180,000 monthly, and because all occupants could be accommodated at the village, consolidating all residents meant that no one was left without a home or unemployed. Given that Nkosi's Haven village had bigger plans in motion, the shift would focus on different things such as training opportunities for residents at the newly purchased farm and other facilities at the Nkosi's Haven Village. These opportunities were unavailable in Berea due to space and financial constraints. Gail reasoned this by stating, “We are not the Titanic. We are consolidating... it makes sense to consolidate and save money.”\n\nNkosi's Haven grew so rapidly that in 2002, a second 2.5 acre plot of land was purchased in the Alan Manor neighbourhood, south of Johannesburg to begin the development of Nkosi's Haven Village. This was made possible through a grant from the Gauteng Department of Housing, Social Housing and Special Needs. Although the project received backlash from neighbouring communities, key sponsors made the initiative possible and enabled Nkosi's Haven to host up to 180 residents at a time.\n\nNkosi's Haven Village in Alan Manor consists of 17 cottages in which residents reside, a sickbay, a library, a baby day care, a therapy block, a kitchen, a bakery, and a leisure block. There are also workshops and classrooms such as a computer room and an arts room for additional education and skill building. Administrative offices are located near the sickbay. All residents share household tasks and duties that help with the functioning of the village, providing a sense of leadership and empowerment to residents through skill-building activities.\n\nIn 2010, Nkosi's Haven received a bakery donation from the South African Whole Grain Bread Project (SAGWBP). In addition to the onsite bakery container donation, SAGWBP donated enough bread mix for six months. White and brown loaves are still produced for resident consumption and are marketed to other organizations in the community at a competitive price. The residents of Nkosi's Haven Village handle oversight of operations in the bakery. While providing skill-building opportunities, those who assist can also earn a stipend for their labour.\n\nIn 2009, Nkosi's Haven opened their new, industrial sized kitchen through generous donations from sponsors. Employed resident mothers cook to feed the large number of residents, serving hundreds of meals daily. Three well-balanced meals are provided to every resident mother, all children and volunteers.\n\nA leisure room was built at Nkosi's Haven Village to further meet the requirements to become a Child Care Centre in South Africa. Dance lessons take place in the large space on a weekly basis. The room is painted with bright colours, equipped with colourful furniture, bean bag chairs, a television, and foosball tables.\n\nNkosi's Haven Library provides a space for resident children to do their homework, leisurely reading, art sessions and workshops. Workshops include HIV/AIDS awareness sessions and life skills for women. Through funding, the Haven continues to expand its book collection in hopes to educate and provide relevant resources for residents.\n\nA recent project development was the implementation of bibliotherapy at the library in 2010. The bibliotherapy program used books to assist the children and young teens with coping with social, emotional and physical issues. The program identified the children's needs and used a variety of programs to help eradicate the isolation of people living with HIV/AIDS through education, self-awareness, skill development, and recreation. Some sessions included storytelling, reading aloud, and \"The Wall of Happiness Sessions\" in which participants openly discussed what made them happy with the facilitator. The program was made available to all residents at Nkosi's Haven, including orphans and those who were free of HIV/AIDS in order to increase overall awareness. Results of the program showed success among residents, with 92% of young participants demonstrating increased knowledge and understanding about HIV/AIDS related issues, 78% demonstrating an increase in comfort and decrease in fear around HIV/AIDS related issues, and 91% of adults demonstrating an improvement in self-esteem and optimistic attitudes.\n\nA music and arts centre has been built onsite for resident use. This centre includes a keyboard and drums and is also a space that is used by the choir. Due to limited space and resources, Nkosi's Haven relies on the help of volunteers to teach music and arts lessons onsite. Programs are run year-round for mothers and their children.\n\nAn ongoing workshop is artsINSIDEOUT's annual two-week art camp that runs at Nkosi's Haven. With the help of ASTEP (Artists Striving to End Poverty), a unique art program featuring successful and competitive professionals from all areas of art including students and graduates from Juilliard, ASTEP volunteer artists use storytelling, singing, acting, dancing and visual arts to inspire the youth at Nkosi's Haven to build community, consciousness and self-awareness. To date, artsINSIDEOUT has organized trips to Nkosi's Haven for 6 years and has provided funding for year-round programming, including workshops and cultural programs. Local artists are invited to join the diverse artsINSIDEOUT team to enhance cultural programs available to Nkosi's Haven.\n\nIn 2006, Nkosi's Haven Village completed the Sickbay, consisting of a 9-bed unit, qualified nursing staff, and family physicians to help care for HIV positive residents. Many residents are sick due to AIDS related illnesses and are being administered quality treatment and ARV's as needed.\n\nAll children at Nkosi's Haven Village receive various forms of therapy, including remedial, play, occupational and speech. The therapy block was completed in December 2009 and employs two full-time therapists onsite to assist residents living with HIV/AIDS. Therapists also assist with helping resident mothers disclose their HIV status to their children.\n\nNkosi's Haven Village has one classroom and two workshops that act as a site for homework and afterschool programs. These areas offer skill-building workshops on a regular basis for residents to learn various skills such as knitting, pottery, resume writing, and more.\n\nWith the help of BT South Africa, an ICT infrastructure company, Nkosi's Haven opened a communications centre in 2010. The room comes equipped with computer monitors valued at R100,000 which allows the youth at Nkosi's Haven to videoconference and chat with their mentors and friends worldwide. Infinite Family, an American organization that enables children living with HIV/AIDS to connect with mentors worldwide, has provided more than 50 youth at Nkosi's Haven with mentors.\n\nThis room is also used to assist resident youth with their homework.\n\nNkosi's Haven 4Life Farm, located 50 km south of Johannesburg, has been in operation since 2008. The farm is 12 acres and currently provides crops for meals at Nkosi's Haven Village. Foundation 4Life has helped support Nkosi's Haven for years and made contributions that helped begin the production of the farm.\n\nWithin the next 5 years of full operation, Nkosi's Haven 4LIFE farm aims to implement a self-sustaining style of living in which mothers living with HIV/AIDS and their children from a neighbouring township and the surrounding area will assist in growing organic food to serve themselves, Nkosi's Haven's residents, and the local markets and supermarkets. The goal is to produce crops for sale in supermarket chains in South Africa once the farm is sustainable and crops are of good standard. A number of new cottages will be built on the farm to accommodate more mothers and their children in need of Nkosi's Haven's assistance.\n\nNkosi's Haven has begun construction on the premises to begin early interventions of child development, skill transfer and various forms of therapy. Given that children in South Africa are held back from attending school if they are undergoing forms of therapy, an onsite preschool bypasses those restrictions and enables youth to develop their skills while receiving therapy. Nkosi's Haven pays R1000 monthly for each toddler to attend preschool outside of Nkosi's Haven, thus, an onsite preschool will save financial resources and assist Nkosi's Haven in becoming self-sufficient and sustainable. Nkosi's Haven plans to hire certified teachers in addition to training resident mothers to assist at the preschool, also building their skills and capacity.\n\n"}

Its main tributaries are the Mekhrenga (right), the Tyogra (left), the Vaymuga (left), and the Bolshaya Chacha (right).\n\nThe river basin of the Yemtsa occupies the east of the Plesetsky District, the south of the Kholmogorsky District, and some areas in the northern parts of the Nyandomsky and Shenkursky Districts. In addition, the territory subordinate to the town of Mirny lies entirely within the limits of the river basin of the Yemtsa. In the low course, the Yemtsa bounds from the south the Siysky Zakaznik, a federal nature protected area.\n\nThe source of the Yemtsa is in Plesetsky District, north-west of the settlement of Plesetsk and several kilometers east of the Onega (which does not belong to the Northern Dvina basin). The Yemtsa flows to north-east. The urban-type settlement of Savinsky is located on the right bank of the river. Note that the urban-type settlement and the railway station of Yemtsa is not located on the river. Downstream from Savinsky, the Yemtsa crosses into the territory of the town of Mirny, and from there into Kholmogorsky District, where it accepts from the right its biggest tributary, the Mekhrenga.

{"id": "2215144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215144", "title": "Norwegian cuisine", "text": "Norwegian cuisine\n\nNorwegian cuisine in its traditional form is based largely on the raw materials readily available in Norway and its mountains, wilderness, and coast. It differs in many respects from continental cuisine through the stronger focus on game and fish. Many of the traditional dishes are the result of using conserved materials, necessary because of the long winters.\n\nModern Norwegian cuisine, although still strongly influenced by its traditional background, has been influenced by globalization: pasta, pizza, tacos, and the like are as common as meatballs and cod as staple foods, and urban restaurants offer the same selection one would expect to find in any western European city.\n\nMost Norwegians eat three or four regular meals a day, usually consisting of a cold breakfast with coffee, a cold (usually packed) lunch at work and a hot dinner at home with the family. Depending on the timing of family dinner (and personal habit), some may add a cold meal in the late evening, typically a simple sandwich.\n\nThe basic Norwegian breakfast consists of milk or fruit juice, coffee (or more rarely tea), and open sandwiches with meat cuts, spreads, cheese or jam. Cereals such as corn flakes, muesli, and oatmeal are also popular, particularly with children, as is yogurt.\n\nUsually consisting of open-faced sandwiches. In cafeterias it is also common with salad bars, warm lunch or dairy products like yogurt and kvarg.\n\nNorwegians usually eat dinner starting around 4 PM. This is the most important meal of the day and typically includes carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and protein-rich foods such as meat or fish.\n\nNorwegians usually eat a very small meal later in the evening before bed. This may consist of foods similar to what is prepared for breakfast.\n\nPreserved meat and sausages come in a large variety of regional variations, and are usually accompanied by sour cream dishes and flatbread or wheat/potato wraps. Particularly sought after delicacies include the \"fenalår\", a slow-cured lamb's leg, and \"morr\", usually a smoked cured sausage, though the exact definition may vary regionally.\n\nLamb's meat and mutton is very popular in autumn, mainly used in \"fårikål\" (mutton stew with cabbage). \"Pinnekjøtt\"—cured and sometimes smoked mutton ribs that are steamed for several hours (traditionally on a bed of birch sticks, hence the name, meaning \"stick meat\")—is traditionally served as Christmas dinner in the western parts of Norway. Another Western specialty is \"smalahove\", a salted, or salted and smoked, lamb's head.\n\nOther meat dishes include:\n\nKjøttkaker – Meatcakes: rough, large cakes—about the size of a child's fist—of ground beef, onion, salt, and pepper—generally served with \"sauce espagnol\" (\"Kjøttkakesaus\" or \"Brunsaus\" in Norwegian). Potatoes, stewed peas or cabbage and carrots are served on the side. Many like to use a jam of lingonberries as a relish. The pork version is called medisterkake.\n\nKjøttboller – Meatballs: A rougher version of Swedish meatballs. Served with mashed potatoes and cream-sauce or \"sauce espagnole\" depending on the locality.\n\nSvinekoteletter – Pork Chops: simply braised and served with potatoes and fried onions or whatever vegetables are available.\n\nSvinestek – Roast Pork: a typical Sunday dinner, served with pickled cabbage (a sweeter\nvariety of the German sauerkraut), gravy, vegetables, and potatoes.\n\nAll good cuts of meat are roasted, as in any cuisine. Side dishes vary with season and what goes with the meat. Roast leg of lamb is an Easter classic, roast beef is not very common and game is often roasted for festive occasions.\nLapskaus – stew: resembles Irish stew, but mincemeat, sausages or indeed any meat except fresh pork may go into the dish.\n\nFårikål – mutton stew: the national dish of Norway. Very simple preparation: cabbage and mutton are layered in a big pot\nalong with black peppercorns, salt (and, in some recipes, wheat flour to thicken the sauce), covered with water and simmered until the meat is very tender. Potatoes on the side.\n\nStekte pølser – fried sausages: fresh sausages are fried and served with vegetables, potatoes, peas and perhaps some gravy.\n\nSyltelabb is usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from boiled, salt-cured pig's trotter. They are traditionally eaten using one's fingers, and served as a snack and sometimes served with beetroot, mustard, and fresh bread or with \"lefse\" or flatbread. Historically \"syltelabb\" is served with the traditional Norwegian \"juleøl\" (English: Christmas Ale), beer and liquor (like aquavit). This is because \"Syltelabb\" is very salty food.\nPinnekjøtt is a main course dinner dish of lamb or mutton ribs, and this dish is largely associated with the celebration of Christmas in Western Norway and is rapidly gaining popularity in other regions as well. 31% of Norwegians say they eat \"pinnekjøtt\" for their family Christmas dinner. \"Pinnekjøtt\" is often served with puréed \"swede\" (rutabaga) and potatoes, beer and \"akevitt\".\n\nSmalahove is a traditional dish, usually eaten around Christmas time, made from a sheep's head. The skin and fleece of the head are torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. The head is boiled for about 3 hours and served with mashed swede (rutabaga) and potatoes.\n\nSodd is a traditional Norwegian soup-like meal with mutton and meatballs. Usually, vegetables such as potatoes or carrots also are included.\n\nHigh cuisine is very reliant on game, such as moose, reindeer (strictly speaking not game, as nearly all Norwegian reindeer are semi-domesticated), mountain hare, duck, rock ptarmigan and fowl. These meats are often hunted and sold or passed around as gifts, but are also available at shops nationwide, and tend to be served at social occasions. Because these meats have a distinct, strong taste, they will often be served with rich sauces spiced with crushed juniper berries, and a sour-sweet jam of lingonberries on the side.\n\nOffal is eaten extensively, \"leverpostei\" (liver pâté) being one of the most common fillings for sandwiches, along with \"sylte\" (brawn) and \"tunge\" (beef tongue).\n\nThe one traditional Norse dish with a claim to international popularity is smoked salmon. It is now a major export, and could be considered the most important Scandinavian contribution to modern international cuisine. Smoked salmon exists traditionally in many varieties, and is often served with scrambled eggs, dill, sandwiches and mustard sauce. Another traditional salmon product is \"gravlaks\", (literally \"buried salmon\"). Traditionally, \"gravlaks\" would be cured for 24 hours in a mix of sugar and salt and herbs (dill). The salmon may then be frozen or kept in a chilled area. Since \"grav\" means \"buried\" it is a common misunderstanding that the salmon is buried in the ground, (similar to how \"rakfisk\" is still prepared). This was the case in the medieval ages because the fermenting process was important, however, this is not the case today. \"Gravlaks\" is often sold under more sales-friendly names internationally. A more peculiar Norwegian fish dish is \"Rakfisk\", which consists of fermented trout, similar to Swedish \"surströmming\".\n\nUntil the 20th century, shellfish were not eaten to any extent. This was partly due to the abundance of fish and the time involved in catching shellfish as compared to its nutritional value, as well as the fact that such food spoils rather quickly, even in a northern climate. However, prawns, crabs, and mussels have become quite popular, especially during summer. Lobster is, of course, popular, but restrictions on the catch (size and season) limit consumption. Lobster has become rather rare and expensive.\n\nPeople gather for \"krabbefest\", which translates to \"crab party\" feasts, either eating readily cooked crabs from a fishmonger or cooking live crabs in a large pan. This is typically done outdoors, the style being rather rustic with only bread, mayonnaise, and wedges of lemon to go with the crab. Crabs are caught in pots by both professionals and amateurs, prawns are caught by small trawlers and sold ready cooked at the quays. It is popular to buy half a kilogram of pie prawns and to eat it on the quay, feeding the waste to seagulls. Beer or white wine is the normal accompaniment.\n\nThe largest Norwegian food export (in fact the main Norwegian export of any kind for most of the country's history) in the past has been stockfish (\"tørrfisk\" in Norwegian). The Atlantic cod variety known as \"skrei\" because of its migrating habits, has been a source of wealth for millennia, fished annually in what is known as the \"Lofotfiske\" named for the island chain of Lofoten. Stockfish has been a staple food internationally for centuries, in particular on the Iberian peninsula and the African coast. Both during the age of sail and in the industrial age, stockfish played a part in world history as an enabling food for cross-Atlantic trade and the slave trade triangle.\n\nA large number of fish dishes are popular today, based on such species as salmon, cod, herring, sardine, and mackerel. Seafood is used fresh, smoked, salted or pickled. Variations on creamed seafood soups are common along the coastline.\n\nDue to seafood's availability, seafood dishes along the coast are usually based on fresh produce, typically poached (fish) and very lightly spiced with herbs, pepper, and salt. While coastal Norwegians may consider the head, roe, and liver an inseparable part of a seafood meal, most inland restaurants do not include these in the meal. In Northern Norway a dish called \"mølje\", consisting of poached fish, roe, and liver, is often considered a \"national dish\" of the region, and it is common for friends and family to get together at least once during winter for a \"møljekalas\" (loosely translated, \"mølje feast\"). A number of the fish species available have traditionally been avoided (especially those perceived as scavengers, due to a fear of indirectly eating friends or family members who had died at sea) or reserved for bait, but most common seafood is part of the modern menu.\n\nBecause of industrial whaling, whale meat was commonly used as a cheap substitute for beef early in the 20th century. Consumption has been declining over time, but it is still widely available in all parts of the country and most Norwegians eat it occasionally. It is not considered controversial in Norway.\n\nOther fish dishes include:\nRakfisk – Norwegian fish dish made from trout or sometimes char, salted and fermented for two to three months, or even up to a year, then eaten without further cooking. Rakfisk must be prepared and stored very hygienically, due to the risk of developing \"Clostridium botulinum\" (which causes botulism) if the fish contain certain bacteria during the fermentation process.\n\nTorsk – Cod: poached, simply served with boiled potatoes and melted butter. Carrots, fried\nbacon, roe and cod liver may also accompany the fish. A delicacy which is somewhat popular in Norway is \"torsketunger\", cod's tongue.\nLutefisk – lyed fish: a modern preparation made of stockfish (dried cod or ling) or \"klippfisk\" (dried and salted cod) that has been steeped in lye. It was prepared this way as a way to preserve the fish for longer periods prior to refrigeration. It is somewhat popular in the United States as a heritage food. It retains a place in Norwegian cuisine (especially on the coast) as a traditional food around Christmas time.\n\nPreparation and accompaniment is for fresh cod, although beer and aquavit is served on the side.\n\nStekt fisk – braised fish: almost all fish are braised, but as a rule, the larger specimens tend to be poached and the smaller braised. The fish is filleted, dusted with flour, salt and pepper and braised in butter. Potatoes are served on the side, and the butter from the pan used as a sauce or food cream is added to the butter to make a creamy sauce.\n\nFatty fish like herring and brisling are given the same treatment. Popular accompaniments are sliced and fresh-pickled cucumbers and sour cream.\n\nFiskesuppe – fish soup: A white, milk-based soup with vegetables, usually carrots, onions, potato and various kinds of fish.\n\nSursild – pickled herring: a variety of pickle-sauces are used, ranging from simple vinegar-\nsugar-based sauces with tomato, mustard, and sherry-based sauces. Pickled herring is served as an hors-d'oeuvre or on rye bread as a lunch buffet. This dish is a popular Christmas/holiday lunch in Norway.\n\nThe basic methods of curing are used: drying, salting, smoking and fermenting. Stockfish is fish (mainly cod) dried on racks, meats are dried, salt curing is common for both meats and fish. Fermenting (like sauer-kraut) is used for trout. Smoking is mainly used on the west coast as an addition to drying and salting, perhaps due to the wet climate.\n\nAlong with the rest of Scandinavia, Norway is one of the few places outside Asia where sweet and sour flavoring is used extensively. The sweet and sour flavor goes best with fish. There is also a treatment called \"graving\", literally burying, a curing method where salt and sugar are used as curing agents. Although salmon or trout are the most common, other fish and meat also get a treatment similar to \"gravlaks\".\n\nSandefjordsmør – a traditional butter and cream sauce typically served with fish dishes such as salmon, garnished with fresh dill and peppercorn. This sauce was reputedly first concocted in Sandefjord, a coastal city near Oslo, in 1959.\n\nGravlaks – sweet and salty cured salmon: a filleted side of salmon or trout that has been frozen for at least 24 hours to kill off parasites, is cured with the fillet and is covered with a half-salt, half-sugar mixture, spiced with black pepper, dill and brandy, covered with cling-wrap, and cured in the refrigerator for three days, turned once a day.\n\nGravet elg – sweet and salt-cured moose: this treatment may be used for all red meat, but works best with game and beef. It is the same procedure as for \"gravlaks\", but aquavit is often substituted for brandy, and juniper berries for dill.\n\nPickled herring: a pickle is made with vinegar, sugar, herbs and spices like dill, mustard seed, black peppercorns, onion and so on. The pickle must be acidic enough to prevent bacterial growth. Rinse, salt-cured herring is added and allowed to stand for at least 24 hours.\n\nTomato pickled herring: this pickle in a thick sauce: 4 Tablespoons tomato paste, 3 Tablespoons sugar, and 3 Tablespoons vinegar are mixed and thinned with about 4 Tablespoons water, flavoured with black pepper and bay leaf. Salt-cured herring is rinsed, cut in 1 cm (1/3in) thick slices and a raw, sliced onion added. Let stand for at least 24 hours.\n\nFruits and berries mature slowly in the cold climate. As a result, they are smaller with a more intense taste. Strawberries, bilberries, lingonberries, raspberries and apples are popular and are part of a variety of desserts, as are cherries in the parts of the country where they are grown. Wild cloudberry is regarded as a delicacy. A typical Norwegian dessert on special occasions is cloudberries with whipped or plain cream. Strawberry-apple pie is also popular because of its rich flavour. Rhubarb pie (\"rabarbrapai\" in Norwegian) is another favoured dish in Norway.\n\nGerman and Nordic-style cakes and pastries, such as sponge cakes and Danish pastry (known as \"wienerbrød\", literal translation: \"Viennese bread\") share the table with a variety of home made cakes, waffles and biscuits. Cardamom is a common flavoring. Another Norwegian cake is Krumkake, a paper-thin rolled cake filled with whipped cream. (Krumkake means 'Curved Cake' or 'Crooked Cake'). Baked meringues are known as \"pikekyss\", literally translated as \"girl's kiss\".\n\nDuring Christmas (\"jul\"), the traditional Norwegian holiday season, many different dessert dishes are served including Julekake, a heavily spiced leavened loaf often coated with sugar and cinnamon, and Multekrem (whipped cream with cloudberries).\n\nBread is an important staple of the Norwegian diet. Breads containing a large proportion of whole grain flour (grovbrød, or \"coarse bread\") are popular, likely because bread makes up such a substantial part of the Norwegian diet and are therefore expected to be nutritious. 80% of Norwegians regularly eat bread, in the form of open-top sandwiches with butter for breakfast and lunch. A soft flat bread called lefse made out of potato, milk or cream (or sometimes lard) and flour is also very popular.\n\nThe variety of bread available in a common supermarket is rather large: \"wittenberger\" (crisp-crusted wheat bread), \"grovbrød\" (whole-wheat bread, often with syrup), \"loff\" (soft wheat bread), sour-dough bread and other German-style breads. Baguettes, ciabatta, bagels and so on are also popular. During the Hanseatic era, cereals were imported in exchange for fish by the Hanseatic League. Both the German Hanseatic League and the Danish colonizers influenced Norwegian cuisine, bringing continental habits, taste and produce. Norwegians are particularly fond of a crisp crust, regarding a soft crust as a sign of the bread being stale. Oat is used in addition to wheat and rye and is perhaps the most unusual cereal in bread-making as compared to continental Europe and the UK. Seeds and nuts (like sunflower seeds and walnuts) are rather common ingredients, along with olives and sun-dried pickles, to improve the texture of the bread.\n\nCheese is still extremely popular in Norway, though the variety of traditional products available and commonly in use is severely reduced. Norvegia is a common yellow cheese (produced since the 1890s) as is Jarlsberg cheese which is also known as a Norwegian export (produced since the 1850s). The sweet \"geitost\" or brown/red cheese (not a true cheese, but rather caramelized lactose from goat milk or a mix of goat and/or cow milk) is very popular in cooking and with bread. More sophisticated, traditional, or strong cheeses include the \"gammalost\" (lit. \"old cheese\"), an over-matured, highly pungent cheese made from sour milk, \"Pultost\", made from sour milk and caraway seeds, and \"Nøkkelost\" flavored with cumin and cloves.\n\nNorway has a particularly strong affinity for coffee and is the second highest consumer of coffee in the world, with the average Norwegian drinking 142 liters, or 9.5 kg of coffee in 2011. Norway has the fourth highest per capita coffee consumption in the world and it plays a large role in Norwegian culture. It is common to invite people over for coffee and cakes and to drink coffee with dessert after the main courses in get-togethers. Coffee is traditionally served black, usually in a mug, rather than a cup. As in the rest of the West, Italian-style coffee bars have become popular. Coffee is included in one of the most traditional alcoholic beverages in Norway, commonly known as \"karsk\", from Trøndelag.\n\nBoth industrial and small-scale brewing have long traditions in Norway. In recent years, microbreweries and craft beer have become increasingly popular. Despite restrictive alcohol policies, there is a large community of brewers, and a colorful variety of beverages, some legal, some less so. The most popular industrial beers are usually pilsners and red beers (\"bayer\"), while traditional beer is much richer, with a high alcohol and malt content. The ancient practice of brewing \"Juleøl\" (Christmas beer) persists even today, and imitations of these are available before Christmas, in shops and, for the more potent versions, at state monopoly outlets. Cider brewing has faced tough barriers to commercial production due to alcohol regulations. The famous honey wine, \"mjød\" (mead), is mostly a drink for connoisseurs, Norse and medieval historical re-enactors, and practitioners of åsatru and other Norse neopagan religions. The climate has not been hospitable to grapes for millennia, and wines and more potent drinks are available only from the wine monopolies.\n\nDistilled beverages include \"akevitt\", a yellow-tinged liquor spiced with caraway seeds, also known as akvavit or other variations on the Latin \"aqua vitae\" – water of life. The Norwegian \"linie\" style is distinctive for its maturing process, crossing the equator in sherry casks stored in the hull of a ship, giving it more taste and character than the rawer styles of other Scandinavian \"akevittar\". Norway also produces some vodkas, bottled water and fruit juices.\n\nIn rural Norway, it is still common to find \"hjemmebrent\" (moonshine, literally \"home burnt\"). Even for personal consumption, it is illegal by Norwegian law to produce distilled alcohol. If the product has more than 60% alcohol by volume, it is defined as a narcotic by the law and the punishments are even harsher than for other drugs. The traditional home distiller is mostly left alone by the law enforcers, but those who produce on a larger scale and sell the product are not.\n\nIn Norway beer is available in stores from 9am to 8pm on weekdays and from 9am to 6pm on Saturdays. Wine and spirits can be bought until 6pm on weekdays and until 3pm on Saturdays in government-owned and run liquor shops (Vinmonopolet). Only \"true\" grocery stores are allowed to sell beer; gas stations and so-called \"Fruit & Tobacco\" marts (\"Frukt og Tobakk\" or \"kiosk\" in Norwegian) are not.\n\n"}

The city of Sipán is dated from 50–700 AD, the same time as the Moche Period.\n\nSipán is an archaeological site where royal tombs were discovered and excavated between 1987–1990, a fairly recent find in the last 30 years, and is considered to be a very important archaeological discovery. Many of the tombs were looted, yet the artifacts that remained and were discovered by archaeologists play an important role in understanding the Moche rulers and tradition. Tombs have been found also in Sipán's Huaca Rajada, an area near Chiclayo. The tombs in the area are of adobe construction, of pyramidal shape, and have now shown erosion which could have been exacerbated over time by successive \"El Niño\" events. There is very little research on the commoners of Sipán, yet it is well known that the commoners often paid a tax through labor which allowed for the creation of the burial platforms for the Lords of Sipán. These platforms and other adobe structures are often made with marked adobe bricks which tracked this labor in order to pay off taxes. Other than providing labor for the Lord there is very little known specifically about Moche commoners from Sipán.\n\nThe tombs of Sipán allowed for archaeologists and anthropologists to get a better understanding of the Sacrifice Ceremony of the Sipán rulers that had been illustrated on murals, ceramics, and other decorative goods. The Sacrifice Ceremonies were often depicted with prisoners among gods or royalty. The tombs at Sipán showed that rulers actually took part in such Sacrifice Ceremonies when looking at the artifacts uncovered including: adornments and a headdress that matched the illustrations of the ceremony along with large knives and tools that would have been used for bloodletting and decapitation.\n\nIn February 1987, a man by the name of Ernil Bernal led a band of \"huaqueros\" (tomb looters) who tunneled into one of the pyramids located at Huaca Rajada. Over the next few nights, they took a large number of valuable metal objects, destroying hundreds of ceramics and human remains in the process. Untold numbers of artifacts were lost, sold for profit to private collections on the black market. Alva arrived with the police a day or more later, after an exceedingly ornate mask had been confiscated from the \"huaqueros\" stash house and presented to the researcher. There are a number of accounts from the events taking place upon the arrival of Alva and the police, however it is clear that they were able to drive the \"huaqueros\" away from the site, erect fences around the tombs, and begin excavation. Thereafter Alva and his team excavated 12 more tombs while villagers and \"huaqueros\" threw rocks and taunted them in an attempt to get the researchers out of the site and allow the looting to continue. The villagers were unsuccessful, however, as Alva completed his work which became the foundation of the \"Royal Tombs of Sipán\" discussed below.\n\nDuring the excavations in 1987–1990, a spectacular treasure of gold and silver ornamental and ceremonial artifacts was recovered, dating to AD 50–300. These objects demonstrate the outstanding craftsmanship of the Moche metalsmiths through their use of elaborate and advanced metalworking techniques. Moche smiths made these artifacts out of thin sheets of copper alloys, using electrochemical processes to purify an extremely thin (0.5–2.0 μm) layers of gold or silver coating.\n\nTo make the artifacts, copper ingots were hammered into sheet metal and formed into the desired shape (e.g. a mask). While the exact method for adding the gold film to the outside is not known, one well-accepted theory is that gold was likely dissolved in aqueous solutions of corrosive compounds recovered from the Northern Peruvian deserts and brought to a low boil, after which the copper sheet was dipped in resulting in the reaction:\n\nthereby dissolving copper and depositing gold on the surface of the metal. The sheet is then heated to between 500 and 800C, allowing the gold film to permanently bond to the surface. These gold films were not pure gold, but have been found to be of gold-copper-silver solutions (ex. CuAuAg).\n\nSome of the silver artifacts (namely individually made head-shaped beads, about 4.0 cm by 5.1 cm) were formed by alternating between hammering and annealing copper-silver alloy (CuAgAu) resulting in copper-oxide forming along the surface which can be removed using an acid (plant juices) or base (stale urine that has turned to ammonia). After many repetitions, the copper will be depleted resulting in the appearance of pure silver (in actuality silver only makes up 18% of the surface). Other silver artifacts are believed to have been made in roughly the same manner, but contain as much as 90% silver on the surface \n\nExamples of metalwork found in Sipán include the above-mentioned head-shaped beads, peanut-shaped beads, coffin straps, fan handles, spearheads, a copper-plated banner, ceremonial knives, golden headdresses, silver and gold nose and ear ornaments, scepters, a gold necklace made of 10 spiderweb beads (spider bodies with human faces sitting on golden wires), a gilded copper animal (possibly fox or dog), among others. The vast majority of these works were placed in richly decorated tombs, indicating both their high value toward the Sipán leadership and the frequent need for artisans to continue to make new artifacts as old ones were buried.\n\n\n\nA reconstruction of one of the tombs of Sipán is on display the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\n\n\n\n"}

Thirteen years of age at this point, he began practicing on the Firule tennis club clay courts in parallel to studying shipbuilding at the streamlined high school in Split. Upon graduating he attempted to enroll at a community college (viša škola) in Zagreb, but due to not meeting the entrance criteria ended up in Novi Sad where he studied administration (viša upravna škola).\n\nPilic reached the semi finals of Wimbledon 1967, beating Roy Emerson before losing to John Newcombe. Then open tennis arrived and Pilic was one of the Handsome Eight, a group of players signed by Lamar Hunt in 1968 for the newly formed professional World Championship Tennis (WCT) group.\n\nIn 1970, Pilić won the men's doubles title at the US Open together with his French partner Pierre Barthès by defeating the Australians John Newcombe and Rod Laver in four sets. His best singles performance at a Grand Slam tournament came in 1973 when he reached the final of the French Open but lost to Ilie Năstase in three straight sets.\n\nPilić was the catalyst to the 1973 Wimbledon boycott. In May of that year, the Yugoslav tennis federation alleged that Pilić had refused to represent them in a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand earlier that month. Pilić denied the charge, but was suspended by the federation, and the suspension was upheld by the ILTF, albeit decreased from nine months to one month, meaning that he could not enter the Wimbledon Championships. In protest at the suspension, 81 of Pilić's fellow professionals, organized into the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and including 13 of the 16 seeds, withdrew from the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nNote: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.\n\nAfter retiring from playing tennis professionally, Pilić began coaching and became the first captain to win the Davis Cup trophy for three different nations: Germany in 1988, 1989 and 1993, Croatia in 2005 and Serbia in 2010. He's been working with Serbia Davis Cup team in the adviser role since 2007, and won the Davis Cup title in 2010.\n\nHe runs a tennis academy in Oberschleißheim near Munich where he resides. Professional champions such as Michael Stich, Novak Djokovic, Ernests Gulbis and Anastasija Sevastova developed and came through the Pilic academy.\n\nIn 1970, Pilić married Serbian actress Mija Adamović. The couple has children together.\n\nIn 2020 he was awarded the Golden medal of merits of Republic of Serbia.\n\n"}

A member of the Republican Party, he sat on the House Judiciary Committee, which in 1974, voted to refer articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon to the full House.\n\nRailsback was born on January 22, 1932, in Moline, Illinois, to municipal lawyer Fred Railsback and Elizabeth (Johnson) Railsback. He attended public schools in Moline, received a B.A. from Grinnell College in 1954, and received a J.D. from Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago in 1957. He served in the United States Army from 1957 to 1959.\n\nIn November 1962 Railsback was elected as a Republican to the Illinois House of Representatives. Four years later, in the 1966 election, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating the Democratic incumbent Gale Schisler.\n\nAlthough inspired to enter politics by the staunchly conservative Barry Goldwater, Railsback was a moderate Republican while in the House. A longtime member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, he participated in the 1973–74 impeachment process against President Richard Nixon. Railsback and his Democratic colleague Walter Flowers led what Railsback called a \"fragile bipartisan coalition\" which crafted two articles of impeachment against Nixon, charging him with: obstruction of justice in attempting to impede the investigation of the Watergate break-in and abuse of power by misusing the authority of the office of the presidency on multiple occasions, dating back to the first year of his administration (1969). He, along with five other Republicans (out of the 17 on the committee), voted with all 21 Democrats in advancing these articles to the House floor. In an emotional July 24, 1974 speech on the House floor, he said that his obligations to uphold the Constitution superseded his personal loyalties to Nixon, a friend who Railsback praised as having many significant achievements.\n\nSupport for Nixon's impeachment among congressional Republicans was the key factor leading to Nixon's decision to resign his office the next month. Despite the vitriol voiced against him by pro-Nixon commentators and constituents, he went on to be re-elected four more times. \n\nWhile in the House, Railsback had a key role in the passage of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. In 1979, he and Wisconsin Democrat David Obey co-sponsored legislation to reduce the influence of political action committees in election spending. He opposed Ronald Reagan's effort to abolish and eliminate funding for the Legal Services Corporation, which provided legal aid to poor Americans.\n\nIn 1980, Railsback was one of three U.S. House members, along with future Vice President Dan Quayle of Indiana and Tom Evans of Delaware, involved in the controversial Florida golfing trip with lobbyist Paula Parkinson.\n\nOver eight terms in office, Railsback had established strong political support in his district; the \"Washington Post\" noted that \"He took what might have been a marginal district—a mixture of rural Republican counties and a labor stronghold in Moline-Rock Island—and built a secure political base by salting his GOP voting record with support for civil rights and some labor positions.\" In 1982, however, Illinois had lost two districts in reapportionment after the 1980 census, and through redistricting, Railsback's district (now renumbered as the 17th District) changed in composition to become significantly more conservative. He was defeated for renomination in the 1982 Republican primary by a considerably more conservative Republican, State Senator Kenneth G. McMillan. McMillan was defeated by Democrat Lane Evans in November.\n\nRailsback was a mentor to Raymond H. LaHood, who worked for Railsback from 1977 to 1982 before becoming a U.S. Representative himself, and later U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the Obama administration.\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Railsback worked as a lobbyist. He was executive vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America and also worked for the Federal Judges Association as its Washington coordinator.\nRailsback married Patricia Sloan in 1955, and they had four daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. Railsback later married Joyelyn (Silver) Railsback, known as Joye. He had 19 grandchildren.\n\nRailsback retired to Idaho, where he and his wife lived in McCall and Meridian.\n\nHe died on January 20, 2020, in Mesa, Arizona, after a period of declining health.\n\n"}

The majority of individuals in the area speak French.\n\nIn 1897, the Restigouche and Western Railway Company embarked on a project to build a railway linking Campbellton and St-Léonard, two towns in northwestern New Brunswick. The progress of its construction sent workers deep into the forest. In 1909, Simon Gallant, an Acadian working as a blacksmith, decided to settle his family by a stream near Five Fingers where he found a stray cow.\n\nAt the same time, authorities began to worry about the emigration of Québec families to the United States and to Western Canada, resulting in a population decline. Msgr. Joseph Arthur Melanson, the largest settler and missionary in Saint-Quentin Parish, originally named Anderson Siding, launched a large program of colonization. Valuing farming and agriculture, he encouraged Acadien and Québécois families to settle in the Restigouche region of New Brunswick on the fertile lands along the length of the newly built train line.\n\nThe village of Anderson Siding was founded in 1910; its first mass was held in Simon Gallant's round log cabin in the forest. The first chapel was built in 1911, its first post office in 1912, its first school in 1913, and its first church in 1918. The name Anderson Siding was changed to the present name of Saint-Quentin in 1919 in commemoration of the Canadian victory in the French town of the same name during the Battle of the Somme in the First World War. Its first hospital, Hôtel-Dieu Saint-Joseph, was built in 1947 and is still in operation today.\n\nSaint-Quentin was incorporated as a district in 1947, as a village in 1966, and as a town in 1992.\n\nMother tongue language (2011)\n\nLogging of the area's rich forests is Saint-Quentin's largest industry. The two sawmills, Groupe Savoie and North American Forest Products, are Saint-Quentin's largest employers, employing 400 and 225 employees respectively. Agriculture is another major industry in the region near Saint-Quentin. Livestock is raised for dairy, beef and pork production, and potatoes, grain and hay are grown on the area's many farms. The production of maple syrup and other maple sugar products is the third major industry in the region; there are over 35 commercial maple plantations as well as 25 traditional sugar shacks in the area.\n\nSince 1984, Saint-Quentin has hosted the \"Festival Western\" (Western Festival) in mid-July of each year, the largest Western-themed festival of its kind in New Brunswick. Run by Le Festival Western de Saint-Quentin, Inc., it now includes rodeo, a parade, fireworks, children's activities and much more. The largest event is the \"Pow-Pow\", a flea market and gathering of local musicians and performers which takes place on Rue Canada, the main street of the town, which is closed to traffic for the occasion.\n\nIn 2005, the former railway station, which was reconstructed in its original location, reopened as a tourist centre as well as the offices of the Chamber of Commerce and the \"Festival Western\". The route of the train tracks, which have been removed, has been transformed into a trail for walking, bicycling, and riding all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

They continued until 1984, having several hits on the UK Indie Chart. The band re-formed in the late 1990s.\n\nThe band formed in early 1978, with an original line-up of Phil Stanton (vocals), Rob \"Spike\" Harrington (guitar and vocals), Andy Lealand (guitar), Mark \"Shark\" Harris (drums), and Mark \"Savage\" Parsons (bass guitar). Parsons and Stanton left in 1979, with Spike moving to lead vocals, and Lealand's girlfriend Louise Wright joining on bass.\n\nInfluenced by the likes of the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and The Ramones, the band started off covering punk rock hits and soon started to compose their own material. They were the second band signed to Chris Berry's No Future Records label, and their debut release, the double A-sided \"Police story/Killing machine\" was released on 28 September 1981. It reached #5 on the UK Indie Chart, on the back of a tour with label-mates Blitz, and with strong support from Sounds writer Garry Bushell. Following the success of this single, The Partisans were included on the third volume of Bushell's Oi! compilation series \"Carry On Oi!\", which reached #60 on the UK Album Chart, and won the band gig slots with Blitz, Peter and the Test Tube Babies and The Ejected, as well as a 'No Future' night at London's \"Zig Zag Club\" with Red Alert, The Lombardos, and Peter and the Test Tube Babies. \n\nThe band released its second single, \"17 Years of Hell\", on 27 May 1982, peaking at #2 on the Indie Charts. This was followed by their self-titled debut LP, released in February 1983. It hit #5 in the Indie Chart and #1 in the Punk Chart, amid considerable critical acclaim from the national press and the underground fanzine culture. \n\nAfter the departure of Louise Wright, the remaining members relocated to Bayswater in west London, with new bassist Dave Parsons to relaunch the band. Their next release was the three-track \"\"Blind Ambition\"\" EP on Cloak & Dagger Records, which peaked at #23 on the Indie Chart, and got played on Prime Time Radio 1. The LP, \"Time Was Right\", followed in 1984, described as \"The Professionals meets The Clash,\" and reaching #20 in the Indie Chart. The album featured live recordings from a gig at the Brixton Ace, at which The Partisans supported Anthrax, Lost Cherrees, Conflict and others.\n\nThe band split up in 1984. Dave Parsons later found chart success with Transvision Vamp and, even later, became a worldwide success with Bush. Andy moved to Scandinavia. Andy and Rob recorded one more session in late 1989 for Link Records under the name Agent Orange including Andy's then partner Iggi. In the late 1990s Lealand and Harrington reformed the band along with two of Lealand's Swedish friends, Magnus Neundorff and Mikael \"Gustav\" Gustavsson. The band signed to American label TKO who issued the \"So Neat\" single in 2001, followed by a new full-length LP/CD in 2004 \"Idiot Nation\" on Dr. Strange. Currently the band are writing and recording new material.\n\nIn 2006 the band toured the UK with fellow Welsh hardcore punk band Picture Frame Seduction and played the Berlin festival Punk n' Disorderly in 2007. No further plans are being made to play live, even if on November 27th 2015 they opened for Italian glam rock band Giuda at Orion, rock venue in Ciampino, a little town near Rome.\n\n\n\n"}

Today, the style is used when referring to archbishops and non-royal dukes and duchesses in the United Kingdom.\n\nExamples of usage include His Grace The Duke of Norfolk; His Grace The Lord Archbishop of Canterbury; or \"Your Grace\" in spoken or written address. Royal dukes, for example The Duke of York, are addressed with their higher royal style, Royal Highness.

It was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival and has been exhibited at several international art shows. In 2010, it was included as one of the titles in the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\".\n\n\"Façade\" puts the player in the role of a close friend of Trip and Grace, a couple who recently invited the player to their New York City apartment for cocktails. This pleasant gathering, however, is somewhat damaged by the clear domestic confrontation between Grace and Trip upon the player's entry. Making full use of the incorporated language processing software, \"Façade\" allows the player to type sentences to \"speak\" with the couple, either supporting them through their troubles, driving them farther apart, or being thrown out of the apartment.\n\nIncorporating elements of both interactivity and drama, \"Façade\" takes advantage of voice acting and a 3-D environment, as well as natural language processing and other advanced artificial intelligence routines, to provide a robust interactive fiction experience. The player can take an active role in the conversation, pushing the topic one way or another, as in an interactive stage-play. These stage-plays are stored as script text files which can be read after the player has finished.\n\n\"Façade\" was released for Microsoft Windows in July 2005, as a free download from the InteractiveStory.net web site.\n\n, the creators of \"Façade\" were developing another title called \"The Party\", however, in December 2013, Michael Mateas confirmed that they were not currently working on it.\n\nMost playthroughs end with either Trip and Grace managing an initial reconciliation and telling the player they need to be alone, or being so offended by the player that Trip forcibly removes them from the apartment. However, with active intervention, it is possible to inspire the two to rediscover their love for one another, or to push one to leave the other – sometimes admitting a past affair, one of many events decided at random when play begins.\n\nBecause much of it is designed to simulate 'on-the-fly' reactions to the player's or other characters' actions, and because the scenario features a random series of events (such as what conversational topics are brought up, what drinks Trip wants to serve, etc.) it possesses a certain amount of replay value.\n\nThe parser through which the player communicates to the actors is also notable for its ability to recognize and accept a large number of complex commands and respond to them adequately. Many questions can be fully parsed by the engine and the actors can respond in a variety of ways dependent on their mood, random fluctuations, and the player's past actions. For example, in one scenario, Grace may respond favorably to the statement 'I love your decorations.', while in another context she may believe you are being condescending to her. Although not every statement made by the player will be successfully parsed, often the engine will pull related information and integrate it using the built-in voice acting clips. As such, proper spelling and grammar is almost always required for optimal player experience.\n\n\"Façade\" won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival; an early, incomplete version was a finalist at the 2004 Independent Games Festival. It has been exhibited at several international art shows including ISEA 2004 and Game/Play 2006, and was the subject of a feature article in both \"The Atlantic Monthly\" in November 2006 and \"\" in May 2007.\n\n\"Façade\" has received a mixed reception: as technology and possibility it is widely considered a major advance in interactive drama, while opinions on how enjoyable it is to play are more divided. Some find that when successful, it is very effective drama, while others find the drama to be a weak point. The open-ended narrative, with many possible outcomes, is often compared to \"Galatea\" by Emily Short.\n\n"}

In 2002, the attempt to run a streaming package around Japanese player Ichiro Suzuki of the Mariners to little success. With these failures, MLB Advance Media used its ticket rights to get an advance from Ticketmaster in mid 2002.\n\nMLBAM used its $10 million advance from Ticketmaster to meet payroll and make another run at video. A Texas Rangers - New York Yankees game was produced and broadcast online on August 26, 2002. The company continued to tweak online broadcasting. A nine-game pennant race package was sold two week later followed by a $19.95 postseason package. Concurrently with 2003 spring training, MLB.tv was launched at $79.95 for a full season package, which garnered 100,000 subscribers. Those revenues halted the need for additional capital from the teams, taking only $77 million of the original planned $120 million.\n\nIn 2005, MLBAM bought ticket sales company Tickets.com in a deal worth approximately $66 million. MLBAM indicated at the time that the move was spurred by increased attendance at both the major and minor league levels of the sport and the need to make ticket purchases convenient for fans. In 2007, MLBAM signed a five-year deal with StubHub.\n\nIn April 2008, MLBAM signed with Yahoo for ad sales for three years. The company replaced Yahoo with Auditude in a multi-year deal in April 2011.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, \"Sports Illustrated\" announced the formation of 120 Sports, a streaming sports video service, with financial backing from MLBAM, the NHL, and Silver Chalice.\n\n2K announced that it would not exercise its license to publish a 2015 MLB video game for the Xbox. Thus MLBAM developed a game from scratch in one and half years with only a dozen programmers. The game however was poorly received by the critics.\n\nIn February 2015, it was reported that MLBAM was planning to spin off its streaming technology division as an independent company, with investments by MLB and other minority partners. MLB-specific properties (such as MLB.com) would remain under league control. The formation of the spin-out, known as BAMTech, was approved by the company's board of directors on August 13, 2015.\n\nOn August 4, 2015, the National Hockey League announced a six-year deal with MLBAM for it to take over its digital properties, including its websites, mobile apps, operations and distribution of its digital streaming service NHL GameCenter Live (renamed NHL.tv outside of Canada), and migrating NHL Network to the facilities of MLB Network. The deal is worth $600 million over the life of the contract, and also granted the NHL an equity stake of up to 10% in BAMTech.\n\nAs of January 2018, MLBAM has a video game development team of 30+ employees who are working on R.B.I Baseball 18, the R.B.I Baseball franchise was revived by MLBAM in 2014. With R.B.I Baseball 14, 15, 16, and 17, MLBAM had outsourced development to several external development studios and had a small group dedicated to overseeing production and managing publishing duties, that had all changed with R.B.I Baseball 18 when MLBAM decided to move development in-house. R.B.I Baseball is a unique product due to the fact that this is \"the only instance of a professional sports league producing its own console video game,\" MLBAM is now a video game developer, producer and publisher as a result.\n\nIn 2017, the company's chief executive, Robert Bowman, was forced out after allegations related to his workplace conduct.\n\nThe most successful venture to date for MLBAM is the At Bat app for the iPhone and iPad, which is downloadable from the iTunes store and also available as an Android app on Google Play. In April 2012, MLBAM announced that the MLB.com At Bat 12 application surpassed the three million download mark, achieving the milestone only eight days into the 2012 MLB regular season and more than four months earlier than its record-setting 2011 campaign.\n\nMLBAM CEO Robert Bowman had this to say about MLBAM in an article entitled \"What did you learn in 2012 that you will carry forth with you into 2013?\":\n\nThe toughest thing to do in a poker hand and in this business is stand pat. This year we decided to make our At Bat app universal between the iPad and iPhone, which we knew going in would cost us 100,000 subscribers. We threw in At Bat for free with an MLB.tv subscription, which would also cost us revenue. And we added up a monthly At Bat subscription to get people to test the product out. We gave customers more options and a better deal, and we had a record year in paid content. We learned we're at an inflection point. Customers now understand and appreciate the nuance of content economics. You'll see more of that value pricing from us going forward.\n\n120Sports, LLC is an online streaming-video sports channel company owned by Time Inc. / Sports Illustrated, MLBAM, the NHL, the PGA TOUR, Campus Insiders and Silver Chalice. The channel produces 2 minute or 120 second segments thus the origin of the streaming service's name. The president of 120 Sports is Jason Coyle and is based at Harpo Studios, owned by Sterling Bay, in Chicago.\n\nThe channel is supported by six one-minute commercial breaks on the fours within live programming. Other sponsorship programs consist of wraparound promos and brand integration. Silver Chalice and Sports Illustrated, owned by Time Inc., are both selling national advertising.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, it was announced that Silver Chalice had partnered with Sinclair Broadcast Group to merge 120 Sports and Campus Insiders with Sinclair's syndication service and linear digital television channel American Sports Network into a new linear and digital sports network, which became known as Stadium.\n\nMLBAM signed a five-year, $50 million interactive rights deal with the MLB Players Association in 2005 to acquire most of the players' online rights, including fantasy sports. The deal exacerbated tension between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics. The players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved. During the 1980s and 1990s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations, but many companies did not. The issue came to a head when MLBAM denied a fantasy baseball licensing agreement to St. Louis-based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc., the parent company of CDM Sports. CBC filed suit as a result. CBC argued that intellectual property laws and so-called \"right of publicity\" laws don't apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports. The FSTA filed a friend of the court brief in support of CBC which argued that MLBAM's step to deny CBC a license was the first step to limit the number of companies in the market, that could result in MLBAM having a monopoly. CBC won the lawsuit as U.S. District Court Judge Mary Ann Medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by fantasy companies. \"The names and playing records of major-league baseball players as used in CBC's fantasy games are not copyrightable,\" Medler wrote. \"Therefore, federal copyright law does not pre-empt the players' claimed right of publicity.\" The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in October 2007. \"It would be a strange law that a person would not have a First Amendment right to use information that is available to everyone,\" a three-judge panel said in its ruling.\n\nOn June 2, 2008, the United States Supreme Court denied MLB's petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\nMLBAM has lost nearly $2 million on the case and may now opt out of the agreement with the MLBPA and also faces the potential loss of millions of dollars of licensing fees from major media companies, such as Fox. ESPN opted out of a seven-year, $140 million deal with MLBAM after three years in January 2008. The decision to opt out came less than three months after the CDM case was upheld on appeal as \"ESPN thinks the court's decision means that it was paying a license fee for fantasy rights that others, such as CDM, were getting free.\"\n\nMLBAM has been issued some patents with others still \"patent pending\" before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. For example, MLBAM was awarded U.S. Patent No. 7,486,943 for geolocating and blocking fans from viewing local games online. In addition, MLBAM was issued a patent for a system and method for allocating seats for a ticketed event. Another example of an MLBAM patent is U.S. Patent No. 8,045,965 entitled \"System and method for venue-to-venue messaging,\" which lists MLBAM CEO Robert A. Bowman as a co-inventor (inventorship).\n\nMLBAM has been the subject of patent infringement lawsuits. See, for example, \"DDB Techs., L.L.C. v. MLB Advanced Media, L.P.\" This case began as a patent infringement suit between DDB Technologies (DDB) and MLBAM over several patents for generating a computer simulation of a live event for display on a viewer's computer as well as one patent for a method allowing a viewer to search for certain information about a live event. The technology at issue was being used for simulation of baseball and other sporting activities. The case was finally settled with MLBAM acquiring rights to the DDB patent portfolio.\n\nMLBAM has also been sued for patent infringement of the Front Row Technologies patent portfolio covering the delivery of sports and entertainment video to hand held devices such as smartphones (e.g., iPhone, Android), pad computing devices (e.g., iPad, Kindle, etc.), laptop computers and the like. According to the patent infringement complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, MLBAM infringed U.S. Patent Number 8,090,321 entitled \"Transmitting sports and entertainment data to wireless hand held devices over a telecommunications network.\" \n\n"}

At a stagnation point the speed of the fluid is zero and all of the kinetic energy has been converted to internal energy and is added to the local static enthalpy. In both compressible and incompressible fluid flow, the stagnation temperature is equal to the \"total temperature\" at all points on the streamline leading to the stagnation point. See gas dynamics.\n\nStagnation temperature can be derived from the First Law of Thermodynamics. Applying the Steady Flow Energy Equation\n\nwhere:\n\nSubstituting for enthalpy by assuming a constant specific heat capacity at constant pressure (formula_5) we have:\n\nor\n\nwhere:\n\nStrictly speaking, enthalpy is a function of both temperature and density. However, invoking the common assumption of a calorically perfect gas, enthalpy can\nbe converted directly into temperature as given above, which enables one to define a stagnation temperature in terms of the more fundamental property,\nstagnation enthalpy.\n\nStagnation properties (e.g. stagnation temperature, stagnation pressure) are useful in jet engine performance calculations. In engine operations, stagnation temperature is often called total air temperature. A bimetallic thermocouple is often used to measure stagnation temperature, but allowances for thermal radiation must be made.\n\nPerformance testing of solar thermal collectors utilizes the term \"stagnation temperature\" to indicate the maximum achievable collector temperature with a stagnant fluid (no motion), an ambient temperature of 30C, and incident solar radiation of 1000W/m. The aforementioned figures are just arbitrary values and do not possess any true meaning without a proper context.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2215182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215182", "title": "John Henry Patterson (author)", "text": "John Henry Patterson (author)\n\nLieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, (10 November 1867 – 18 June 1947), known as J. H. Patterson, was a British soldier, hunter, author and Christian Zionist, best known for his book \"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo\" (1907), which details his experiences while building a railway bridge over the Tsavo river in British East Africa (now Kenya) in 1898–99. The book has inspired three Hollywood films – \"Bwana Devil\" (1952), \"Killers of Kilimanjaro\" (1959) and \"The Ghost and the Darkness\" (1996) in which he was portrayed by Val Kilmer.\n\nIn the First World War, Patterson was the commander of the Jewish Legion, \"the first Jewish fighting force in nearly two millennia\", and has been described as the godfather of the modern Israel Defense Forces.\n\nPatterson was born in 1867 in Forgney, Ballymahon, County Longford, Ireland, to a Protestant father and Roman Catholic mother.\n\nHe joined the British Army at the age of seventeen and eventually attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He finally retired from the military in 1920.\n\nIn 1898, Patterson was commissioned by the Uganda Railway committee in London to oversee the construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in present-day Kenya. He arrived at the site in March of that year.\n\nAlmost immediately after Patterson's arrival, lion attacks began to take place on the workforce, with the lions dragging men out of their tents at night and feeding on their victims. Despite the building of thorn barriers (\"bomas\") around the camps, bonfires at night, and strict after-dark curfews, the attacks escalated dramatically, to the point where the bridge construction eventually ceased due to a fearful, mass departure by the workers. Along with the obvious financial consequences of the work stoppage, Patterson faced the challenge of maintaining his authority and even his personal safety at this remote site against the increasingly hostile and superstitious workers, many of whom were convinced that the lions were in fact evil spirits, come to punish those who worked at Tsavo, and that he was the cause of the misfortune because the attacks had coincided with his arrival.\n\nThe man-eating behaviour was considered highly unusual for lions and was eventually confirmed to be the work of a pair of rogue males, who were believed to be responsible for as many as 140 deaths. Railway records officially attribute only 28 worker deaths to the lions, but the predators were also reported to have killed a significant number of local people of which no official record was ever kept, which attributed to the railway's smaller record.\n\nVarious theories have been put forward to account for the lions' man-eating behaviour: poor burial practices, low populations of food source animals due to disease, etc. There was a slave trade route through the area, which contributed to a considerable number of abandoned bodies. Patterson reported seeing considerable instances of unburied human remains and open graves in the area, and it is believed that the lions (which, like most predators, will readily scavenge for food) adapted to this abundant, accessible food supply and eventually turned to humans as their primary food source. One of the lion's skulls was found to have a badly abscessed canine tooth that could have hindered normal hunting behaviour. However, this hypothesis accounts for the behaviour of only one of the lions involved, and Patterson himself personally disclaimed it, saying he had damaged the tooth.\n\nWith his reputation, livelihood, and safety at stake, Patterson, an experienced tiger hunter from his military service in India, undertook an extensive effort to deal with the crisis. After months of attempts and near misses, he finally killed the first lion on the night of 9 December 1898 and the second one on the morning of 29 December (narrowly escaping death when the wounded animal charged him). The lions were maneless like many others in the Tsavo area, and both were exceptionally large. Each lion was over nine feet long from nose to tip of tail and required at least eight men to carry it back to the camp. \n\nThe workers and local people immediately declared Patterson a hero, and word of the event quickly spread far and wide, as evidenced by the subsequent telegrams of congratulations he received. Word of the incident was even mentioned in the House of Lords, by the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury.\n\nWith the man-eater threat finally eliminated, the workforce returned and the Tsavo railway bridge was completed on 7 February 1899. Although the rails were destroyed by German soldiers during the First World War, the stone foundations were left standing and the bridge was subsequently repaired. The workers, who in earlier months had all but threatened to kill him, presented Patterson with a silver bowl in appreciation for the risks he had undertaken on their behalf, with the following inscription:\n\nPatterson considered the bowl to be his most highly prized and hardest won trophy.\n\nIn 1907, he published his first book, \"The Man-eaters of Tsavo\", which documented his adventures during his time there. It was the basis for three films; \"Bwana Devil\" (1953), \"Killers of Kilimanjaro\" (1959) and the 1996 Paramount Pictures film, \"The Ghost and the Darkness\", starring Val Kilmer (as Patterson) and Michael Douglas (as the fictional character \"Remington\").\n\nIn 1924, after speaking at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, Patterson agreed to sell the Tsavo lion skins and skulls to the museum for the then sizeable sum of $5,000. The lion skins were then stuffed and are now on permanent display along with the original skulls. The reconstructed lions are actually smaller than their original size, due to their skins' having been originally trimmed for use as trophy rugs in Patterson's house.\n\nIn 1906, Patterson returned to the Tsavo area for a hunting trip. During the trip, he shot an eland, which he noted possessed different features from elands in Southern Africa, where the species was first recognized. On returning to England, Patterson had the head of the eland mounted, where it was seen by Richard Lydekker, a member of the faculty of the British Museum. Lydekker identified Patterson's trophy as a new subspecies of eland, which Lydekker named \"Taurotragus oryx pattersonianius\".\n\nColonial Secretary Lord Elgin appointed Colonel Patterson to the post of Game Warden — that is, superintendent of game reserves in the East Africa Protectorate, an experience he recounts in his second book, \"In the Grip of Nyika\" (1909).\n\nWhile on a safari with Audley Blyth, a son of James Blyth, 1st Baron Blyth, and Blyth's wife Ethel, Patterson's reputation was tarnished by Blyth's death by a gunshot wound (possible suicide – exact circumstances unknown). Witnesses confirmed that Patterson was not in Blyth's tent when the shooting took place, and that it was in fact Blyth's wife who was with him at the time, as she was reported as having run screaming from the tent immediately following the shooting. Patterson had Blyth buried in the wilderness and then insisted on continuing the expedition instead of returning to the nearest post to report the incident.\n\nShortly after, in poor health, Patterson returned to England with Mrs Blyth amid rumours of murder and an affair. Although he was never officially charged or censured, this incident followed him for years after in British society and in the army. His case was raised in Parliament in April 1909. The incident was referenced in the film \"The Macomber Affair\" (1947), which was based on Ernest Hemingway's \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" (1936).\n\nPatterson joined the Essex Imperial Yeomanry for the Second Boer War (1899–1902), and served with the 20th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in November 1900. He returned home, but was again called for service when on 17 January 1902 he was appointed to command the 33rd Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. The battalion left Southampton on SS \"Assaye\" in May 1902, arriving in South Africa after the war had ended with the Peace of Vereeniging.\n\nColonel Patterson commanded the West Belfast regiment of the Ulster Volunteers during the Home Rule Crisis of 1913–14.\n\nHe served in the First World War. Although he was himself a Protestant, he became a major figure in Zionism as the commander of both the Zion Mule Corps and later the 38th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (also known as the Jewish Legion) which would eventually serve as the foundation of the Israeli Defence Force decades later. The Zion Mule Corps, which served with distinction in the Gallipoli Campaign has been described as \"the first Jewish fighting force in nearly two millennia\".\n\nDuring his time in command of the Jewish Legion (which served with distinction in the Palestine Campaign), Patterson was forced to deal with extensive, ongoing anti-semitism toward his men from many of his superiors (as well as peers and subordinates), and more than once threatened to resign his commission to bring the inappropriate treatment of his men under scrutiny. He retired from the British Army in 1920 as a lieutenant-colonel (the same rank he held when the war started) after thirty-five years of service. It is generally accepted that much of the admiration and respect of his men (and modern-day supporters) is due to the fact that he essentially sacrificed any opportunity for promotion (and his military career in general) in his efforts to ensure his men were treated fairly. His last two books, \"With the Zionists at Gallipoli\" (1916) and \"With the Judaeans in the Palestine Campaign\" (1922) are based on his experiences during these times.\n\nAfter his military career, Patterson continued his support of Zionism. He remained a strong advocate of justice for the Jewish people as an active member of the Bergson Group and a promoter of a Jewish army to fight the Nazis and to stop the Holocaust. He was a member of the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe. During the Second World War, while he was in America, the British government cut off his pension, arguing they had no way to securely transmit his funds to him. This left Patterson in severe financial difficulty. Just the same, he energetically continued working toward the establishment of a separate Jewish state in the Middle East, which became a reality with the statehood of Israel on 14 May 1948, less than a year after his death.\n\nPatterson was close friends with many Zionist supporters and leaders, among them Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Benzion Netanyahu. According to Benzion's younger son Benjamin Netanyahu, who later became Prime Minister of Israel, Benzion named his first son, Yonatan Netanyahu, after Patterson. Patterson attended Yonatan Netanyahu's circumcision and gave him a silver cup engraved with the words \"To my beloved godson Yonatan from Lt.-Col. John Henry Patterson\".\n\nHe married Frances Helena Gray in 1895. She, in 1890, had been one of the first women to take a law degree in the UK. Their son Bryan Patterson (1909–79) became a palaeontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Patterson and his wife, \"Francie\", lived in a modest home in La Jolla, California. Eventually, with his wife in need of regular medical care and his own health in decline, he took up residence at the home of his friend Marion Travis in Bel Air, where he eventually died in his sleep at seventy-nine years of age. His wife died six weeks later in a San Diego nursing home. Both Patterson and his wife were cremated, and their ashes were interred at Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, niche 952-OC in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Patterson's grandson, Alan Patterson, one of his final wishes was that both he and his wife eventually be interred in Israel, ideally with or close to the men he commanded during the First World War. Alan Patterson, the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, Canadian representative Todd Young, Beit HaGedudim (the museum of the Jewish Legion), and the \"moshav\" (village) of Avihayil (represented by Ezekiel Sivak) began a coordinated effort to honour this request in 2010. With the assistance and support of the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on 4 December 2014, the remains of Patterson and his wife, were re-interred in the Avihayil cemetery where some of the men he commanded are buried. Attending the ceremony were Prime Minister Netanyahu, members of his family, military and cabinet members of the Israeli government, the British Ambassador, the Irish Ambassador, Alan Patterson, Jerry Klinger of the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, Ezekiel Sivak of Avihayil, representatives and descendent family members of the Jewish Legion, Christians supporters of Israel, 350 guests and numerous other dignitaries.\nNetanyahu referred to Patterson as \"the godfather of the Israeli army\" and \"a great friend of our people, a great champion of Zionism and a great believer in the Jewish State and the Jewish people...I feel it is an obligation of our people, our State and mine personally to fulfil his testimony\".\n\nA souvenir plate postal stamp was issued by the Israel Philatelic Service in Patterson's honour.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a businessperson and salesperson.\n\nJohn Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1844. He spent his childhood working on the family farm and in his father's sawmills. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1867 and went to work as a canal toll collector until 1870. That year, he began managing the Southern Ohio Coal and Iron Company. He became an investor in the National Manufacturing Company in 1882, buying it out with his brother by 1884 to form National Cash Register Company.\n\nIn 1893 he constructed the first \"daylight factory\" buildings with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that let in light and could be opened to let in fresh air as well. This was in an era when sweatshops were still in operation elsewhere. He hired John Charles Olmsted to landscape the grounds of the National Cash Register Company campus in Dayton, with spacious lawns and landscaping with colorful plantings. Olmsted also had a hand in designing the residential community surrounding the plant (South Park) as well as a park system for the City of Dayton.\n\nBased on a 16-page handbook written by his brother-in-law, Patterson established the world's first sales training school on the grounds of the NCR factory campus (at Sugar Camp in Dayton, Ohio). He also coined a phrase for his service division which, until about the time the company was bought by AT&T, hung on the wall of every service department in the company. The phrase was, \"We Cannot Afford To Have A Single Dissatisfied Customer\".\n\nPatterson was famous for firing Thomas Watson Sr, who went on to become General Manager, then President, of CTR, later renamed IBM. So many prominent businessmen were trained and fired by Patterson that some business historians regarded experience at NCR as the rough equivalent of an MBA degree. Patterson was also famous for firing many people on rather trivial grounds, for example, if they could not tell him why the flags happened to be flying that day. Charles F. Kettering was hired and fired at NCR multiple times; once for failing at an equestrian event. Reportedly, Patterson fired him with the remark: \"Anybody who can't handle a horse can't handle men.\"\n\nIn 1912, NCR was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Watson and 26 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.\n\nDuring the Great Dayton Flood disaster, John H. Patterson contributed significantly to the recovery efforts. NCR employees built nearly 300 flat-bottomed boats and Patterson organized rescue teams to save the thousands of people stranded on roofs and the upper stories of buildings. He turned the NCR factory on Stewart Street into an emergency shelter providing food and lodging, and he organized local doctors and nurses to provide medical care. Patterson's vision for a managed watershed for the Great Miami River resulted in the development of the Miami Conservancy District, one of the first major flood control districts in the United States.\n\nPatterson attended Miami University, Oxford, Ohio and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1867. He was something of a health fanatic, and adopted one regimen after another, most of which were required of his executives and employees. While at Miami, Patterson was a member of Beta Theta Pi.\n\nIn 1888 Patterson married Katharine Beck of Brookline, Massachusetts. They had two children: Frederick Beck Patterson and Dorothy Forster Patterson. Mrs. Patterson died of diphtheria in June, 1894 at the age of 28. His nephew, Lt Frank Patterson, was killed in 1918 when his military aircraft crashed near Dayton, Ohio. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was named in his memory. \n\nPatterson lived in his Swiss chalet estate \"The Far Hills\" in Oakwood, Montgomery County, Ohio. Patterson loved the Adirondacks and built his summer estate on Beaver Lake, on the Beaver River east of Lowville, NY. His family built two other estates on the lake. All three estates still exist, two as church camps (Beaver Camp and Unirondack), one as private bed and breakfast.\n\nPatterson died on May 7, 1922, two days after reviewing plans with General Billy Mitchell to develop a center for aviation research in Dayton. He is interred in the Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio. He left no great fortune because of his expenditures on social programs at his company, and because he believed that \"shrouds have no pockets.\" He left ownership of the company to his son Frederick Beck Patterson who took it public in 1925. $55 million in stock was offered to the public in what was the largest business public offering up to that time.\n\nMr. Patterson was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPatterson's methods influenced United States business for a generation. In the period 1910-1930 it was estimated that one-sixth of United States business executives were former NCR executives.\n\n\n"}

The area is named \"Haikū\" after the Kahili flower.\n\nIn 1942, contractors for the U.S. Navy began construction of the Haʻikū Radio Station, a top secret facility that was to be used to transmit radio signals to Navy ships that were then operating throughout the Pacific. In order to obtain the necessary height for the antennae, the Navy stretched them across Haikū Valley, a natural amphitheater. Some remnant parts of the wooden ladder may still be seen beside the metal steps. \n\nThe radio station was commissioned in 1943. To transmit such a powerful signal, the Navy needed a transmitter of greater capability than possible with vacuum tube technology at the time. They therefore decided upon an Alexanderson alternator, a huge device capable of generating powerful low-frequency radio signals, and requiring an antenna of heroic proportions.\n\nWhen the Naval base was decommissioned in the 1950s, the U.S. Coast Guard used the site for an Omega Navigation System station. In the mid-1950s, the wooden stairs were replaced by sections of metal steps and ramps — by one count, 3,922 steps. The station and trail were closed to the public in 1987. Some hikers ignored the \"no trespassing\" signs and continued to climb, contributing to the local community's misgivings about reopening the structure.\n\nIn 2003, the stairs were repaired, costing the city $875,000. As of early 2018, land usage rights issues have not been resolved. The City and County of Honolulu has stated that there is currently no plan to open the stairs for public use, citing liability concerns, although it has been noted that the mayor is vocally open to reopening the stairs under his circumstances. In August 2012, Don Tiki show singer and comedian Fritz Hasenpusch died of a heart attack during his Haikū Stair climb.\n\nIn 2014, 6 people were arrested and 135 were cited for climbing the stairs. The City Prosecutors Office has said that criminal trespass in the second degree carries a $1000 fine. Even in simple trespass cases, the judge has the discretion to hand down fines of up to a thousand dollars. Undeterred, many still hike the stairs on an almost daily basis. Some local residents have even installed \"booby traps\" to stop hikers from passing through their property to reach the stairs.\n\nA hearing to determine the fate of the Haikū Stairs will be held by the Board of Water Supply on Monday April 27, 2020. The board will decide between removal of the stairs, or transfer to the City and County of Honolulu, who could reopen them via a managed access plan.\n\nThe Board of Water Supply voted unanimously on Monday, April 27, 2020 to transfer the Haiku Stairs over to the city to turn the off-limits trail into a paid attraction. The city has 18 months to take over or the stairs will be torn down.\n"}

The book received a favorable reception from reviews in \"Publishers Weekly\", \"Library Journal\", and \"Kirkus Reviews\". A review in \"Flagpole Magazine\" was critical of the book's organization, and observed that the writing wandered a bit, while a review in \"Gay Today\" commented, \"Those who agree with Savage's views will like his book while those who disagree will hate it; in either case there will be no converts.\"\n\nThe book's title is a reference to Robert Bork's 1996 book, \"Slouching Towards Gomorrah\" (itself a reference to Yeats's poem \"The Second Coming\"), in which Bork decried what he saw as modern moral corruption caused by liberalism, especially social liberalism. \"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\" examines the concept of happiness in American culture, as obtained by indulging in each of the Seven Deadly Sins. In each chapter, Savage explores a different subculture in an attempt to understand how its participants gain happiness, and contrasts this with religious conservatism. Regarding his experience of gambling, Savage notes, \"You know the only thing worse than losing big the first time you go into a casino? Winning big.\" Savage writes, \"The truly revolutionary promise of our nation's founding document is the freedom to pursue happiness-with-a-capital-H\". The author asserts he is pointing out hypocritical behavior in the book, \"Young people have finely tuned bullshit detectors, and nothing annoys people more than adult hypocrisy\".\n\nThe book was first published by Dutton in 2002 in hardcover format. A subsequent edition was published by Plume, in 2003 in paperback format. Savage appeared on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" as part of the marketing for the book, and supported sex education.\n\n\"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\" was selected for inclusion in \"The Best American Sex Writing 2004\", and won a 2003 Lambda Literary Award in the humor category. A review of the book in \"Publishers Weekly\" was positive and the review concluded, \"On the whole, however, Savage hits the mark and gives advocates of personal and sexual liberty the hippest, sassiest voice they've had in a long time.\" A review in \"Library Journal\" noted, \"His real strength is in blending pungent social commentary with the personal narrative. At least one of these pieces will undoubtedly land in an anthology for future students of the essay.\" The review concluded, \"The explicit nature of this book will make it a difficult purchase for many libraries in the age of Ashcroft, but the justifying argument should be made that any library owning Bork's book needs this one as an antidote.\" \"Kirkus Reviews\" wrote, \"Common sense is Savage’s strong suit, and he makes more of it than a preening moralist ever could.\" Kelly Darrah of \"The Gonzaga Bulletin\" noted, \"'Skipping' does a powerful job of taking a raw look at the embarrassing facets of our society that we often will ourselves not to see. Savage forces us to reexamine what we've been taught about morality and what constitutes an 'ethical' decision.\"\n\nA review by \"Flagpole Magazine\" writer Jyl Inov concluded, \"This book wanders. It talks more about some sins than others and often takes a long time to get to a particular point. But in the end, it is wildly amusing and makes a lot of sense. \"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\" is not going to make converts of conservatives, but if they are willing to read, it just might make them think. As for everybody else, it is reaffirming and potentially motivating.\" In his book \"Reordered Love, Reordered Lives: Learning the Deep Meaning of Happiness\", author David K. Naugle commented, \"This book is an irreverent attack on the 'virtuecrats' who hypocritically impose their moral values on others.\" Writing in a review for \"Gay Today\", Jesse Monteagudo observed, \"Those who agree with Savage's views will like his book while those who disagree will hate it; in either case there will be no converts. Still, in a literary genre dominated by the Borks and Bennetts it is good to hear a dissenting voice. Reading \"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\" reminds us that there is still some sanity left in this world.\" Rebecca Flint of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"Skipping follows the writer as he tackles each of the seven deadlies, hanging out with everyone from gamblers to adulterers to the filthy rich. Lacing his anecdotes with persuasive arguments for the freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness in all its sinful forms, he takes readers on a journey that's as insightful as it is hilarious.\"\n\n\n"}

Stagnation points exist at the surface of objects in the flow field, where the fluid is brought to rest by the object. The Bernoulli equation shows that the static pressure is highest when the velocity is zero and hence static pressure is at its maximum value at stagnation points. This static pressure is called the stagnation pressure.\n\nThe Bernoulli equation applicable to incompressible flow shows that the stagnation pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus static pressure. \"Total pressure\" is also equal to dynamic pressure plus static pressure so, in incompressible flows, stagnation pressure is equal to total pressure. (In compressible flows, stagnation pressure is also equal to total pressure providing the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically.)\n\nThis information can be used to show that the pressure coefficient formula_1 at a stagnation point is unity (positive one):\n\nwhere:\n\nStagnation pressure minus freestream static pressure is equal to freestream dynamic pressure; therefore the pressure coefficient formula_1 at stagnation points is +1.\n\nOn a streamlined body fully immersed in a potential flow, there are two stagnation points—one near the leading edge and one near the trailing edge. On a body with a sharp point such as the trailing edge of a wing, the Kutta condition specifies that a stagnation point is located at that point. The streamline at a stagnation point is perpendicular to the surface of the body.\n\n"}

It is located in the East Los Angeles-area community, surrounded by El Sereno, Chinatown, Boyle Heights and Cypress Park. The school is named after Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and was one of the first public high schools established in California. It is one of the District 5 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the US.\n\nLincoln students are drawn from Chinatown and other areas. Cypress Park residents may attend either Lincoln or Franklin high school.\n\nThe early history of Lincoln High School is unusually complicated because, over the years, it has served all three of the typical grade configurations--elementary school, middle school and high school. What eventually became Lincoln High School was originally established in 1878 as Avenue 21 Grammar School. By 1913, the Avenue 21 school had become an intermediate school and its student population had grown to the point that a new campus was needed. That year the intermediate school moved to the present Lincoln High School site, and the curriculum expanded to include the senior high school grades. This marks the true beginning of Lincoln High. Pending the construction of a new school (the current site) on the former mansion property of Charles Woolwine, the Avenue 21 intermediate school moved its location to the hillside site (now the current physical education and track field), where students studied under the trees. In the early 1970s, students from all six upper grades attended the school together.\n\nIn 1878, the plant was extended across Lincoln Park Avenue, which is now the current site. In 1881, the school added a gymnasium. In 1924, a science building was added. The present school was built extensively in the 1940s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration reform. Much of the construction and renovations occurred after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, which damaged the gymnasium, the auditorium, the music building, the library and the English building. Jim Tunney Stadium, home to Lincoln's football and track teams, was built during the reconstruction of Lincoln High School.\n\nBeginning in the latter part of the 1960s, Lincoln High School became a focal point for the emerging Chicano civil rights movement that was fueled by student activism which called for a more culturally sensitive educational curriculum and access to college preparatory courses for Mexican American students. Encouraged by Sal Castro, who championed equal educational opportunity as a Lincoln High faculty member, students at Lincoln organized a mass walk-out in protest of sub-standard facilities, vocational program tracking for Chicano youth and discriminatory practices which excluded them from advanced college prep courses. In March 1968, Lincoln High students led the first wave of what became the largest student strike in the history of public education in US.

This was followed by the reed chord organ () and Optigan (). The sound of the reed chord organ is somewhat similar to the harmonium or the accordion.\n\nThe Chord Organ was first introduced by the Hammond Organ Company in 1950. It was invented primarily by John M. Hanert, who was Hammond's primary musical engineer at the time. He had previously developed the Novachord and Solovox, two instruments which used vacuum-tube circuitry rather than tone or phonic wheels to generate the tones as in a Hammond Organ.\n\nThe Chord Organ, as the name implies, used a left-hand panel with buttons to play harmony; however, instead of a Stradella-type chord and bass arrangement, a completely new design was implemented. 96 separate chord buttons provided Major, Minor, 7th, Diminished, Augmented, Major 6th, Minor 7th and 9th chords for all twelve musical keys. Two bass pedals, played by the left foot, sounded the \"root\" and \"fifth\" of each chord, and rhythm was added by means of a bar struck by either the palm or the thumb of the left hand.\n\nThe Chord Organ incorporated elements of both the Novachord and the Solovox in that the right-hand 37-note keyboard could play both chords and single notes. An \"Organ\" section provided String and Flute sounds which were polyphonic, while a \"Solo\" division permitted the organist to play single-note melodies superimposed over the polyphonic \"Organ\" division. The Solo division operated essentially identically to the Solovox - one group of controls determined the register or pitch in which the Solo division would sound while another group of controls allowed the player to filter the sound in various ways (\"timbre\" controls).\n\nThere were five different versions of the basic Chord Organ, which was called the \"S\" series. The original model \"S\" used octal tubes and one 12\" speaker while the \"S-1\" used miniature tubes and one 12\" speaker. For the \"S-4,\" two 10\" speakers were substituted for the single 12\" speaker and the wood cabinet was re-designed. The \"S-6,\" the most popular model, added the ability to add Percussion to the Solo division, thereby allowing the instrument to imitate instruments such as Banjo, Hawaiian Guitar, etc. The \"S-100,\" the last revision of the \"S\" series, added built-in Stereo Reverberation, substituted an Expression Pedal for the expression lever used on previous models, and featured a re-styled cabinet design as well as a separate ON/OFF Power Switch (on previous models, power was turned on by swinging the expression lever down similar to the Solovox).\n\nAn additional Chord Organ was manufactured for a brief time in the mid-'60s (the 2000 series), which had a simplified chord panel (Major, Minor, 7th and Diminished chords only) and traditional organ-type voices for the right-hand keyboard. This model also used solid-state circuitry.\n\nIn addition to Hammond, Wurlitzer, Farfisa and Estey Organ made electronic chord organs.\n\nIn 1958, Magnus Organ Corporation introduced its \"electric\" chord organs, similar to electrically blown small home reed organs.Since then, chord organs were generally designed as instruments for beginners, and separated from the mainstream of home electronic organs. In addition to Magnus, Emenee, Bontempi and Belcanto made electric chord organs.\n\n\nChord organs have seen a recent revival amongst minimalist and ambient musicians.\n\n"}

The nearest village to it is Barton St David, and it is located a short distance from Glastonbury and Street. Its population is 823. Butleigh has a church, small village shop, a Church of England primary school and Butleigh Nursery School.\n\nButleigh was mentioned in the Domesday Book, belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It had two separate entries, with the names Bodeslege and Boduchelei.\n\nThe parish of Butleigh was part of the Whitley Hundred.\n\nButleigh Court, which was abandoned for many years and has now been brought back into use, is noted for its interesting architecture including the tall carved chimney stacks, which are all different. Another interesting landmark is the cedar avenue, just outside the village. It was built in 1845 by J. C. Buckler, for Henry Neville-Grenville, on the site of an earlier building.\n\nThe village history is told in a slim book, \"Butleigh: One Thousand Years of an English Village\", by E. F. Synge, a former vicar at the parish church. A reconstruction of life of one farm worker, John Hodges, who lived in the village during the Victorian era, is illustrated at the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury.\n\nThere is the lofty column on the nearby Combe Hill of the Admiral Hood Monument raised to the memory of Sir Samuel Hood on a hill near Butleigh, and in Butleigh Church is another memorial, with an inscription written by Robert Southey.\n\nThere is also a 16th-century pub in Butleigh called The Rose and Portcullis.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Mendip is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism. (Before 1974, Butleigh was part of Wells Rural District.)\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nThe village forms part of the 'Butleigh and Baltonsborough' Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom. From \"Butleigh\" the ward goes east to Baltonsborough then south to Lydford-on-Fosse. The total population of the ward as at the 2011 census was 2,198.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament, which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe Church of St Leonard dates from the 14th century, and was restored and extended in the middle of the 19th century by J. C. Buckler. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.\n\n1st Viscount Admiral Hood\n\n"}

It is based on an Australian novel written by Colin Thiele and published in 1969.\n\nBased on the children's novel by celebrated South Australian author 'Colin Thiele', this is an emotional father and son story about tuna fishing of Southern Blue Fin tuna in South Australia's Port Lincoln fishing district. Accident-prone son Snook is forever making mistakes much to the chagrin of his father Pascoe. But when tragedy strikes the fishing boat during a deep sea fishing trek in the Southern Ocean, the boy is called on to become a man in a rites of sea passage to reconcile his past mishaps and save both his father and the ship from certain disaster.\n\nTwelve-year-old Steve Pascoe is nicknamed 'Snook' by everyone in Port Lincoln. He's thin and long-faced, like the fish he's named after. At school he's no good at sport and, at home, his father scorns him. Snook joins his father and fellow crewmen on a tuna-fishing expedition, when disaster strikes. It is up to Snook to save himself and his father from a desperate situation.\n\n\nThe film is an unofficial follow up to \"Storm Boy\" (1976) with the same writer and star, also adapted from a Colin Thiele novel. The South Australian Film Corporation (SAFC) did not want to use Henri Safran as director, though, so employed another director from the ABC, Carl Schultz.\n\nThe film was shot near Streaky Bay in mid 1978. It was a difficult production and editor Rod Adamson claimed the film would not cut together. Five weeks after filming had completed, Schultz had to leave the film to take up a directing job at the ABC. Accordingly, Matt Carroll of the SAFC called in Bruce Beresford, who was under contract to them, to re-shoot some sequences. Some of these had to be done using a body double for Hardy Kruger since he had returned to Europe. Schultz was supportive of Beresford stepping in but was unhappy with the fact he supervised the final re-cut.\n\nA DVD was released on 1 January 2003.\n\n\n"}

Its members produce some 200 periodical titles with a combined circulation of over 15 million. EPA is a religious and educational non-profit corporation under the laws of the state of California. It is managed by an executive director, who is responsible to a board of six directors. \n\nIn the fall of 1947, a handful of editors met at the convention of the National Sunday School Association and began to talk about an association of evangelical editors. Dr. James DeForest Murch, editor of United Evangelical Action, took the lead and called together a pro tem committee in Chicago on May 6, 1948. Thirty-five editors met at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. They officially organized the Evangelical Press Association, adopted the doctrinal statement of the National Association of Evangelicals and wrote the statement of purpose printed above. On April 4–6, 1949, the first annual convention of the EPA met in Chicago with 103 publications represented.\n\nIn September, 1951, the association mailed the first copies of a news service to its members. It was produced by volunteers who sent out ten releases in the first five months. In 1952 it became a weekly service with a subscription rate of $10 a year. That year also the association began its newsletter, Liaison. In 1954 the association adopted a code of ethics and began an awards program.\n\nEPA has held an annual convention each year since 1949. The conventions were held in Chicago until 1957, then moved to a different city each year after that. The conventions were held in January until 1963 when the date was changed to April or May.\n\nAs the association grew, it demanded an executive secretary to carry on the administrative work and edit the news service. This became a half-time paid position. In 1978, the job of executive secretary was changed to executive director, and the director was charged with giving vision and leadership to the organization. The news service was licensed to an independent news organization, and in 1994 the news service was sold.\n\nHeld each Spring, the annual convention is the focal point of the EPA year. The 3-day convention rotates among major cities throughout the U.S. The goal is to provide three days of learning, sharing, networking, and fellowship, as well as to conduct official association business.\n\nEPA conventions offer speakers of national stature, the annual awards contest, the annual membership meeting and election, occasional tours, and a wide variety of workshops designed for editors, writers, graphic designers, photographers, social media managers, web content managers, and business personnel—from beginners to veterans, and for both print and digital application.\n\nEPA hosts two annual contests: the Awards of Excellence contest (for a publication as a whole) and the Higher Goals contest (for the individual pieces produced—writing, photography, design, etc.). \n\nOther programs and services include press credentials, one-on-one publication critique, scholarships for undergraduate journalism students, an ethics committee to hear complaints, webinars, a legal hotline and various member benefits and discounts from selected suppliers.\n\n"}
{"id": "2215322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215322", "title": "The Beautiful Letdown", "text": "The Beautiful Letdown\n\nThe Beautiful Letdown is the fourth studio album by alternative rock band Switchfoot. Released on February 25, 2003, it launched the band into the mainstream on the strength of two top 20 singles: \"Meant to Live\" and \"Dare You to Move.\" The album was hugely popular and remained a staple on the Billboard 200 album charts for a considerable amount of time. The album sold over 2.7 million copies in the US and was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe album won an \"Album of the Year\" award at the 2003 San Diego Music Awards. It was ranked No. 195 on \"Billboard\"'s \"200 Albums of the Decade\".\n\nIn 2002, the band entered the studio to begin recording the follow-up to their 2000 record, \"Learning to Breathe\". They were unsigned at the time, their contract with re:think Records/Sparrow having expired with the completion of \"Learning to Breathe\". Bassist Tim Foreman has said: \"This was the most freedom we had ever felt while tracking an album – no record labels, no distractions, just four guys making the record we'd always wanted to make.\" They finished recording in two weeks, but shortly afterwards, were signed to the major record label Columbia Records/Red Ink. This ultimately delayed the release, as the label submitted the album for further mixing and marketing. \"Sony is a big battleship of a company,\" said lead singer Jon Foreman. \"It takes a long time to turn it around. It's like parallel parking a Buick.\" It was finally released February 25, 2003, as \"The Beautiful Letdown\".\n\nThe album features a departure from the lo-fi indie rock sound of their previous three albums. This shift to a more layered, heavier rock sound with occasional electronica influences can be attributed to the addition of long-time touring member Jerome Fontamillas as a full-time band member. Contributing more to the recording process by filling in with his added instrumental versatility prompted Foreman to note, \"I feel like Jerome is a great team player. I mean the same thing where live he just kind of fills in, is the same thing on the album. He's just a wonderful guy to have around.\" The sound was also influenced by the fact that \"these were songs that we'd played live countless times, songs that we'd lived with\". \"This was also the most prepared we'd ever been for a record,\" bassist Tim Foreman has commented. The album brings together an eclectic sound as it gathers inspiration from the previous ten years of contemporary rock. The song \"This Is Your Life\" features a more subtle pop jam while the up-beat, light-hearted \"Gone\" brings the album to an entirely different place musically, exemplifying the band's musical versatility.\n\nLyrically, the songs on the album speak of hope in spite of an imperfect world. \"The Beautiful Letdown is about real life: the good, the bad, and the ugly,\" said Jon Foreman. \"It's an honest attempt to reflect on the great and terrible aspects of being human, the tension of existence.\" \"Meant to Live\" expresses this in the lyric, \"We were meant to live for so much more/have we lost ourselves?/We want more than this world's got to offer/We want more than the wars of our fathers.\" While the band's Christian beliefs are clearly communicated through the album's message, bassist Tim Foreman notes: \"We're Christian by faith, not by genre.\" Inspired by their role model U2, the band seeks to merge the appeal of rock with deep and spiritual thoughts.\n\nThe first few promotional copies of the album were printed with the song \"Monday Comes Around\" on it. When the wide release version went to print, Foreman removed the song, as he felt it didn't match the tone of the album. The song can now be found on the 2004 re-release of \"The Beautiful Letdown\" on the accompanying DVD, the b-side of the Meant to Live vinyl single, in copies of the Japan release of \"Nothing Is Sound\", and in the 2007 iTunes Deluxe re-release of \"The Beautiful Letdown.\"\n\nThe guitar that appears on the album cover at the bottom of the pool is actually a guitar that Foreman bought at a pawn shop in North Dakota. The original intention was \"to light it on fire, but the place wouldn't let us light things on fire, so we were going to break it in half.\" But after playing it a few times, Foreman became too attached to it, thus leaving it intact at the bottom of the pool. The photo used on the cover was taken at a \"sketchy hotel\" in North Los Angeles. Several variations of the cover exist. The original 2003 pressings of the record featured black lettering on the artwork, while the 2004 re-issues featured larger white letters and/or a sticker with the title font superimposed onto an image of a drum set.\n\nThe release of their fourth studio album was met with resounding success, selling over 2.6 million copies and becoming certified double platinum. Despite the overwhelming success of the now mainstream Christian band, some criticized \"The Beautiful Letdown\" claiming that it lacked originality and saying that it was too similar to other alternative Christian rock such as Jars of Clay and Creed.\n\nIn 2004, \"The Beautiful Letdown\" was re-released in two different forms: A standard CD-only reissue featuring a slightly tweaked audio mix, as well as new artwork, and a CD/DVD package.\n\nThe CD/DVD edition featured a DVD that included a few bonus-features, including the entire album in 5.1 Surround Sound.\n\nIt also featured a Making of \"Dare You to Move\" video, as well as Version 1 of the music video itself, an acoustic impromptu performance of \"On Fire\", and two previously unreleased bonus tracks, \"Monday Comes Around\" and \"Meant to Live (Live)\".\n\nIn 2005, the album was released, this time as a DualDisc. The audio side remained the same as the 2004 re-issue, and the DVD side featured all of the same features, but also included the second version music video of \"Dare You to Move.\"\n\nSwitchfoot\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nRecorded at Sage and Sound, Mansfield Lodge, and Jon Foreman's house.\n\nMixed at Larrabee North 3.\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nMany of Switchfoot's songs have been used in various TV shows and movies.\n\n\n"}

He was a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral and educated at St Paul's Cathedral School, Radley College near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and the Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\nHe took part in \"'Allo 'Allo!\" during the vast majority of the series. Dressed in an ankle-length leather coat and with the obligatory stiff-legged limp and walking stick, Herr Flick spent his life suppressing peasants, seducing Helga, the German town Commandant's assistant, and vainly trying to get his hands on the original of the painting 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' by Van Klomp.\n\nGibson then toured with the group when \"'Allo 'Allo!\" transferred to the stage and had successful tours both in the United Kingdom and abroad. The stage version of the show gave rein to his other skills, and he was able to demonstrate his mastery of the violin.\n\nHis first film role of note was in the 1971 film \"The Go Between\", in which he played Marcus Maudsley, school friend of Leo Colston (Dominic Guard) who passed messages between Julie Christie and Alan Bates, and he also played young Tony Farrant in the 1973 film version of \"England Made Me\". He has also played a wide variety of roles on stage and the TV screen, and in 2006 was a regular guest on \"The Daily Telegraph's\" World Cup Pubcast, where he usually took the role of Herr Flick, providing a more biased view of the proceedings. In 2003, he guest starred in the \"Doctor Who\" audio drama \"Flip-Flop\".\n\nIn the past 15 years, he has divided his time between Ireland and the UK, and continues to work in films, television, and theatre.\n\nDue to the enduring popularity of \" 'Allo!

The original German version uses a rule system in which the gamemaster and players draw associative, tarot-like cards instead of rolling dice to determine the outcome of an event (this system is called the Arcana system in the original German version). The English version of \"Engel\" does not include the Arcana system at all; it is based on the d20 System instead. The German version includes d20 rules in addition to the Arcana system. The game was published by the German publisher Feder&Schwert (German for \"Feather&Sword\"), who also published the World of Darkness RPG series in Germany and used to publish the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" series.\n\nIn the flooded, quasi-medieval Europe of 2654, massive islands are the domains of the orders of the Angelitic Church. The Engel, seemingly the angels of Judeo-Christian belief, patrol the skies from their fortresslike Heavens, ceaselessly striving to defend the people of Europe against the hordes of the verminous [Dreamseed]. The eternally youthful Pontifex Maximus in Roma Æterna, in Italy, presides over a bureaucratic and autocratic church, having combined religious and secular power into a perfectly integrated whole. Within its dominion, dark riders take a tithe of every village's children for the unknown purposes of the church. Many of the cities have broken away from the direct command of the Church, coming under the sway of Junklords (Diadoches) who keep alive what remains of antediluvian technology. In the face of very real and very quantifiable evil, the people of Europe increasingly turn away from the direct political, cultural, and spiritual leadership of the church. As the numbers of the Engel plateau, players must navigate politics, war, and faith as the guardians of Europe.\n\nFive orders of angels serve mankind and the Angelic Church in Roma Æterna. The Michaelites are the leaders of the hosts; the Urielites are the messengers of the Lord; the Gabrielites are the angels of death; the Ramielites are the keepers of knowledge; and the Raphaelites are the divine healers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book follows the standard d20 System convention of six primary statistics, classes, levels, experience points, feats, and skills. Normal humans have access to only the aristocrat, commoner, expert, fighter, rogue, and warrior classes. The Engel have access to special classes and abilities restricted to their bands; unlike humans, they are incapable of multiclassing. There is no magic; there are only Potestas (powers), which work as skills restricted by the Engelic band the player chooses. Such powers drain the hit points of the Engel; a similar but less harmful mechanic is found in the \"Star Wars d20 Roleplaying Game\".\n\nAll core mechanics are included, in abbreviated form, in the \"Engel Corebook\". Equipment of the quasi-medieval setting of Engel is described, along with rules for pre-Flood artifacts such as firearms, grenades, and ceramic armor. A small selection of NPCs and sample player characters is provided, along with a map of the new Europe and a more-or-less complete history of the World of Engel since the Flood. Certain sections are explicitly forbidden for players to read, as they contain spoilers about the overall plot. Nonhuman NPCs (the Dreamseed creatures) are only briefly detailed though frequently mentioned; they are detailed in the supplement \"Creatures of the Dreamseed\", released in 2002.\n\nDescribed by Shannon Appelcline as \"Perhaps the most unusual d20 book published directly by White Wolf\" was \"Engel Corebook\" (2002), a very early OGL-licensed release that took a German post-apocalyptic fantasy game previously published by Feder & Schwert and converted it to d20. Appelcline stated that \"It was notable as a rare German game that (sort of) made it to the American market, but ultimately failed because of a lack-luster d20 conversion.\" Appelcline went on to say that \"White Wolf's \"Engel Corebook\" (2000) had been the first real look at a German RPG in the US — except that White Wolf converted it to d20, which probably removed much of its novelty. Unfortunately, FanPro's \"The Dark Eye\" didn't make any waves either, perhaps because it was a fairly traditional FRPG. As a result, FanPro only supported the game with two supplements.\"\n\n\"Engel\" is no longer being actively supported by Sword & Sorcery Studios and the line was dropped in 2004, although copies of the Corebook are available in their online store. \"Creatures of the Dreamseed\" is not in stock and is only available through third parties.\n\nA graphic novel set in the world of Engel, \"Pandoramicum\", details some of Engel's history leading up to the current events in the \"Engel\" Corebook. It too is out of print.\n\n\"Order Book: Michaelites\", a supplement detailing one of the orders of Engel, was also released prior to the product line's cancellation. It is no longer in stock.\n\nThe 2001 album \"Engel\" by the English duo In the Nursery was commissioned by Feder&Schwert as an album of music inspired by the game.\n\n"}

{"id": "2215386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215386", "title": "Deilephila elpenor", "text": "Deilephila elpenor\n\nDeilephila elpenor, the elephant hawk moth or large elephant hawk moth, is a moth in the family Sphingidae. Its common name is derived from the caterpillar's resemblance to an elephant's trunk. It is most common in central Europe and is distributed throughout the Palearctic region. Its distinct olive and pink coloring makes it one of the most recognizable moths in its range. However, it is quite easy to confuse the elephant hawk moth with the small elephant hawk moth, a closely related species that also shares the characteristic colors.\n\nThese moths are nocturnal and therefore feed on flowers that open or produce nectar at nighttime. The elephant hawk moth has very sensitive eyes that allow it to see color even at low-light, and it was one of the first species in which nocturnal color vision was documented in animals. The moth is also known for its hovering capability, which it utilizes when feeding on nectar from flowers. This behavior is costly in terms of energy and can help explain why the moth has evolved such enhanced visual capabilities for efficient feeding. The moths also have an important role as pollinators throughout their habitat.\n\nThe \"D. elpenor\" moth has olive-brown colored forewings outlined with pink. Two pink lines also run through the wings. The first line is usually thicker and terminates in the center of the wings near a white dot. The second line, which runs below the first, starts at the white inner margins and runs until the tip of the wing. The hindwings have a black inner half that gradually turns pink from the middle outwards. It is outlined by white fringes. The head, thorax, and body are also olive-brown in color with pink markings throughout.\nTwo separate subspecies, \"Deilephila elpenor elpenor\" and \"Deilephila elpenor lewisii\", were recognized in the past, but they are no longer regarded as well-distinguished. Similarly, the subspecies \"Deilephila elpenor szechuana\" is now thought to be a synonym for \"Deilephila elpenor elpenor\". The subspecies \"Deilephila elpenor macromera\", found in southern China, northern India, Bhutan and Myanmar, is still regarded as distinct.\nThe elephant hawk moth is often confused with the small elephant hawk moth (\"Deilephila porcellus\"). There are clear distinctions in size and coloring that can help differentiate between the two. As the name suggests, the small elephant hawk moth is much smaller. It is also more yellow in color around its body. The most obvious defining feature is the thick pink stripe going down the elephant hawk moth's abdomen that is missing on the small elephant hawk moth's abdomen. The two species are not usually seen together in garden traps because the small elephant hawk moth prefers more open habitats.\n\n\"D. elpenor\" is very common in central Europe and has a distribution throughout the palearctic region. The species is especially well-distributed in England, Wales, and Ireland. Until the 1980s, \"D. elpenor\" was only present in the southern half of Scotland, but now it has made its way up the north coast and into the country's mainland as well. In general, the moth's range becomes thinner and less concentrated in the northern parts of Europe. The range also extends throughout Asia and even to Japan.\n\n\"D. elpenor\" inhabits a variety of habitats. These include rough grassland, heathland, sand dunes, hedgerows, woodland, the open countryside, and even urban gardens. The moths play an important role in pollination throughout their habitats. For example, previous studies on hawk moths have indicated that they can pollinate up to 5-10% of the tree and shrub species in the area they inhabit.\n\nThere is usually only a single generation of \"D. elpenor\" in a given year. Occasionally, a small number of second generation individuals in a single year will be recorded in the late summer, but this is very rare. The pupae overwinter in cocoons, and the species become active from May to early August. Its peak activity time is between the midsummer months of June and September.\nThe females lay eggs either singly or in pairs on the leaves of plants that can act as food sources to the caterpillars when they emerge. These include but are not limited to rosebay willowherb (\"Epilobium angustifolium)\" and bedstraws (of the genus \"Galium\"). The moths are also attracted to human-made gardens, and eggs have frequently been found on garden fuchsias, dahlias, and lavender. The eggs are whitish-green and have a glossy texture. Eggs will usually hatch in ten days.\n\nYoung larvae are a yellowish white to green color. When they have finished growing, the larvae are a brown-gray color with black dots along the length of the body. Larvae have a backward curving spine or \"horn\" that is the same color as their body on the final abdominal segment. Fully grown larvae can measure up to 3 inches (7.62 cm) in length. They also weigh somewhere between ; during their lifetime, they ingest a total of of plant material.\n\nVariation in color has been observed in nature. Specifically, a green version of the full-grown larva exists within the species. Previous research has shown that the color variation is not due to a simple inheritance pattern, and specific explanations still remain inconclusive.\n\nIt takes around 27 days for \"D. elpenor\" to move from the larva stage to the pupa stage. When the larvae are fully grown, they will look for a place to pupate. Usually, this ends up being at the base of a plant in plant debris or underneath the surface of the ground. Once they have found a secure spot, they will line the pupal chamber with a few strands of silk, pupate, then overwinter as pupae. Their pupae are brown with darker brown speckles throughout, and the divisions between the segments appear black. Pupae are 40–45 mm long.\n\nThe wingspan of \"D. elpenor\" that have been collected in Europe measure to be around 60–70 mm. There is also very little variation between the male and female \"D. elpenor.\" Adults are the most active during the month of June. They visit flowers and feed on the nectar at night, and are especially attracted to plants such as honeysuckles (\"lonicera\").\n\nMany Lepidoptera species have evolved eye spots either on their body (when they are caterpillars) or on their wings (as fully grown adults). This dark, circular marking is generally thought to resemble the eyes of a predator and deter attacks from birds that feed on insects. This mimicry is effective because the caterpillar is usually somewhat concealed, and because the predators must respond to the signals quickly.\n\nWhen it feels threatened by a predator, the caterpillar will widen the anterior part of the body. This defensive posture emphasizes the eyespots and makes it more conspicuous. Some research have suggested that this allows the eyespots of the caterpillar to resemble a snake more closely than it could when it is at rest.\n\nExperiments using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy have identified (\"E\")-11-hexadecenal and (10\"E\", 12\"E\")-10,12-hexadecadienal [(\"E,E\")-bombykal] as the major components of the female sex pheromone. These pheromones are the most active when females are actively exhibiting calling behavior and visibly showing their ovipositors.\n\n\"D. elpenor\" have incredibly sensitive eyes that allow them to have color vision even at nighttime. Studies have analyzed the dark-adapted eyes of \"D.elpenor\" and have found three visual pigments with a maximal wavelength of 345 nm, 440 nm, and 520 nm. These values respectively correspond to ultraviolet, blue, and green wavelengths. Most vertebrates, such as humans, lose the ability to use the three types of photoreceptors present in the eye in dim light conditions. However, all three types of photoreceptors remain functional in various light conditions for \"D. elpenor\", giving it the ability to have scotopic color vision. This species was the first instance in which being able to see color at night was documented in animals. Usually, increased color sensitivity results in decreases in spatial resolution. However, despite the incredible sensitivity of its eyesight, the moth also has a reasonable spatial resolution. This nighttime color vision is necessary because of the moth's feeding patterns. \"D. elpenor\" feeds at the darkest hours of night and also hovers over the flower to suck its nectar out rather than sitting on the flower. Locating the correct flower and hovering over it are both visually demanding tasks.\n\n\"D. elpenor\" feed on nectar from flowers. When most insects forage, they land on the flower to retrieve the nectar. However, \"D. elpenor\" hovers in front of the flower rather than landing on the flower itself. The moth then extends its long, straw-like proboscis to attain its food. While hovering, its wings beat at a high frequency to stabilize the body from the drift of the wind. This flight pattern is quite costly; therefore, it is important for the moth to be able to feed effectively by knowing where to find nectar.\n\nSince they are nocturnal, the moths tend to feed on flowers that open or produce nectar at twilight or during the night. These are commonly termed \"hawkmoth flowers.\" \"D. elpenor\" are able to see color, an ability that is usually absent from most other nocturnal species. Their particular visual system allows them to discriminate between various wavelengths even at low illumination, allowing the moths to find correct food sources while foraging.\n\nOlfaction also plays an important role in feeding for the moth. Many of the hawkmoth flowers contain a pleasant smell. Previous studies have found that fragrance release from the hawkmoth flowers stimulate flower-seeking behavior by the moths. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that both visual and olfactory cues play a role in the feeding behavior of \"D. elpenor\".\n\n\"D. elpenor\", like many other insects, can learn to adapt its behavior to changing environmental conditions. Experiments with \"D. elpenor\" has shown that it can discriminate between various visual stimuli (i.e. color) and associate it with a food reward. This behavior is especially important because the wrong decision when choosing a food source can prove to be a costly mistake in terms of time and energy resources. The experiment was conducted through the use of differently colored artificial flowers. When no reward in the form of nectar was given by the flower, the moth did not further participate in foraging behavior with that particular flower. This demonstrated the moth's need to keep energy expenses as low as possible while foraging.\n\nPeak flight time for \"D. elpenor\" is between the months of June and September. Since the species is nocturnal, the moth will fly from dusk until the morning. Then it will rest at one of its food sources until dusk comes again. The moth has a maximum flight speed of 4.5— 5.1 m/s. The wind confers mechanical resistance to the wings while flying. Therefore, winds have negative effects on the energy budget of the moth. As a result, \"D. elpenor\" stop visiting flowers at wind speeds starting at 3.0 m/s.\n\n\"D. elpenor\" are particularly adept at hovering, which is a necessary skill for obtaining nectar. It utilizes spatial cues and motion-detecting neurons to steady itself.\n\nSome natural predators use bright coloring to attract its prey, which includes \"D. elpenor\". The conspicuous body coloring of certain nocturnal invertebrates, such as the white forehead stripes on the brown huntsman spider, lures the flying moth to its predator.\n\nBats are also known to prey on the moth.\n\n"}

Sedition is overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that is deemed by the legal authority to tend toward insurrection against the established order: if the statement is in writing or some other permanent form it is seditious libel. Libel denotes a printed form of communication such as writing or drawing.\n\nAmerican scholar Leonard W. Levy argues that seditious libel \"has always been an accordion-like concept, expandable or contractible at the whim of judges\".\n\nUnder the common law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a statement was seditious under the common law if it brought into \"hatred or contempt\" either the Queen or her heirs, the government and constitution, either House of Parliament, or the administration of justice; or if it incited people to attempt to change any matter of Church or state established by law (except by lawful means); or if it promoted discontent among or hostility between British subjects. A person was only guilty of the offence if they had printed words or images and intend any of the above outcomes. Proving that the statement is true was not a defence. The common law offence was punishable in the UK with life imprisonment.\n\nParliament abolished the offence of sedition and seditious libel in 2009. However, there continue to be similar offences in other statutes, such as the Terrorism Act 2000, which criminalises threats of action which are designed to \"influence the government\" or \"to intimidate the public or a section of the public\" for \"the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause\".\n\nIn Canada, seditious offences are defined by sections 59 to 61 of the Criminal Code. A seditious offence can be punished by imprisonment up to a maximum term of 14 years. The concept of a \"seditious intention\" is defined in part as follows: \nHowever, the breadth of this section is reduced by s 60, which provides \"seditious intention\" does not include communications made in good faith to criticise measures taken by the government, to point out errors or defects in government, or to point out matters that tend to produce ill-will between Canadians.\n\nSeditious speech is speech directed at the overthrow of government. It includes speech attacking basic institutions of government, including particular governmental leaders. Its criminalization dates back at least as far as the Alien and Sedition Act.\n\nAccording to John Cohan, \"A delicate line can be crossed, whereby lawful criticism of government may become seditious speech, where associating with others in robust criticism of government may become subversive activities punishable by law\". The \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\" U.S. Supreme Court decision maintains that seditious speech—including speech that constitutes an incitement to violence—is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as long as it does not indicate an \"imminent\" threat.\n\nDuring World War II, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle to prosecute seditionists, but Biddle declined, believing it to be unwise. Today's anti-war activists are not prosecuted for seditious speech.\n\nThe crime of seditious libel was defined and established in England during the 1606 case \"De Libellis Famosis\" by the Star Chamber. The case defined seditious libel as criticism of public persons, the government, or King.\n\nThe phrase \"seditious libel\" and \"blasphemous libel\" were used interchangeably at that time, because of the strong unions between church and state. Blasphemy was later made a separate offence, and finally abolished with the passing of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. Sedition and seditious libel were abolished by section 73 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Sedition by an alien is still an offence under the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919.\n\nThe United States' Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 broke with the common law precedent of the time, in that it allowed for truth as a defense, though judges were not consistent in their rulings.\n\nJohn Peter Zenger was arrested and imprisoned for seditious libel in 1734 after his newspaper criticized the colonial governor of New York. Zenger spent nearly 10 months in jail before being acquitted by a jury in August 1735. One hundred years later, Nova Scotia's Joseph Howe also won a jury acquittal on a charge of seditious libel after his newspaper printed allegations that local politicians and police were stealing from the people.\n\nHaving severely censured the actions of the government in print with reference to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre, Sir Francis Burdett was prosecuted at Leicester assizes, fined £1,000, and committed to prison by Best, J. for three months for the crime of \"composing, writing, and publishing a seditious libel\" with explanation: \n\n"}

Located on Chaleur Bay 20 km northwest of Bathurst, Petit-Rocher's residents are 92% Francophone. Its current population meets the requirements for \"town\" status under the Municipalities Act of the Province of New Brunswick, however the community has not requested a change in municipal status.\n\nThe village was founded in 1797 by Acadian settlers. The name literally means 'little rock', and is pronounced by most anglophones in the region as \"Petty Roche\". The name of the village is reputed to derive from the fact that the village's founders disembarked on a small rock. The village was named \"Little Roche\" from 1850 to 1854, then \"Madisco\" until 1870, and then \"Petit Rocher\". The hyphenated form \"Petit-Rocher\" was adopted in 2009. Some old maps have the name \"Petite Roche\" (1812) and \"Sainte Roque or Little Russia\" (1827).\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Petit-Rocher was host to the CCBHA's annual ball hockey tournament with a team from nearby Dundee taking home the Allen, Paquet & Arseneau cup as champions for both tournaments.\n\n\n"}

Currently, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member districts by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 295 members are elected from single-member districts, for a total of 475. 238 seats are therefore required for a majority.\n\nEach Block (multi-member) district spans one or more Prefectures, and each Prefecture spans one or more single-member district, so the districts are organized by Block district and then by Prefecture. In general, the Block districts correspond loosely to the major Regions of Japan, with some of the larger regions subdivided.\n\nUp to the 1993 general election all members of the House of Representatives were elected in multi-member constituencies by single non-transferable vote. In 1994, parliament passed an electoral reform bill that introduced the current system of parallel voting in single-member constituencies and proportional voting blocks. The original draft bill in 1993 by the anti-LDP coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa included proportional party list voting on a national scale, an equal number of proportional and district seats (250 each) and the possibility of split voting. But the bill was stalled in the House of Councillors. After the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had returned to power later that year, it was changed to include proportional voting in regional blocks only, the number of proportional seats was reduced, but the possibility to cast two separate votes was kept in the bill. The electoral reform law was finally passed in 1994. It was first applied in the 1996 general election.\n\nThe Block constituency for Hokkaidō (比例北海道ブロック) elects 8 members proportionally. It comprises Hokkaidō Prefecture, which is divided into 12 single-member districts.\n\nThe Block constituency for Tohoku (比例東北ブロック) elects 14 members proportionally.\n\nThe Block constituency for Kitakanto (北関東) elects 20 members proportionally. It includes the northern part of the Kantō region.\n\nThe Block constituency for southern Kanto (比例南関東ブロック, \"hirei minami-Kantō burokku\") elects 22 members proportionally. It includes the southern part of the Kantō region.\n\nThe Block constituency for Tokyo (比例東京ブロック) elects 17 members proportionally.\n\nThe Block constituency for Hokurikushinetsu (北陸信越) elects 11 members proportionally. It corresponds to the Hokuriku region and the Shin'etsu region.\n\nThe Block constituency for Tokai (東海) elects 21 members proportionally.\n\nThe Block constituency for Kinki (近畿) elects 29 members proportionally.\n\nThe Block constituency for Chugoku (中国) elects 11 members proportionally.\n\nThe Block constituency for Shikoku (比例四国ブロック) elects 6 members proportionally.\n\nThe Block constituency for Kyūshū (九州) elects 21 members proportionally. It includes Okinawa Prefecture as well.\n\nAmendments to the electoral law in 2002 and 2013 changed the boundaries of single-member districts and reapportioned seats between prefectures (+5/-5 in 2002; +0/-5 in 2013, resulting in a net change of -5 in district seats in the House of Representatives to 295 and overall seats to 475). The borders of the regional proportional blocks have never changed, but the apportionment of seats to the regional proportional blocks changed in 2000 after the number of proportional seats had been reduced from 200 to 180 (reducing the total number of seats in the lower house from 500 to 480), and in the 2002 reapportionment.\nAnother reapportionment was passed by the National Diet in June 2017. In the majoritarian segment, it will change 97 districts in 19 prefectures, six are eliminated without replacement (one each in Aomori, Iwate, Mie, Nara, Kumamoto and Kagoshima). In the proportional segment, four \"blocks\" lose a seat each (Tōhoku, N. Kantō, Kinki, Kyūshū). Thus, the number of majoritarian seats is reduced to 289, the number of proportional seats to 176, the House of Representatives overall shrinks to 465. The reform takes effect one month after promulgation, i.e. on July 16, 2017.\n\n\n"}

Comprising songs submitted by each partner label, the annual \"WOW Hits\" releases are usually double CD sets. \n\nThe birth of the WOW record project can be traced to Grant Cunningham, A&R Director at Sparrow Records. In November 1994, Grant made a business trip to EMI Limited in London, which at the time was the parent company of Sparrow Records. There he noticed that several British record labels were issuing an annual CD of top-rated songs, known as the \"NOW\" series, containing collections of pop songs. Grant brought the idea back to Sparrow. Sparrow executives suggested a similar project be developed for Christian pop music and Grant was assigned the task of getting the project off the ground. The WOW franchise represents the most successful collections of Christian music ever issued.\n\nReleased in late 1995, \"WOW 1996\" was the first in the WOW Series and the first recording put together by the three major Christian record companies of the time: Word Records (now Word Entertainment), Sparrow Records (formerly part of EMI Christian Music Group), and Reunion Records (now part of Sony's Provident Label Group). Still today, after each submitting label agrees to a reduced master royalty, the final decision on the tracks to be included is made by committee. Production, marketing, and distribution for the \"WOW Hits\" series was handled by EMI Christian Music Group, and from 2013, by Capitol Christian Music Group, which is now a Universal Music Group company. \n\nIn 1999, the annual \"WOW Worship\" series was launched. Rather than using the year, each release is identified by the color of the cover. The worship series and hits series are today among the best-selling members of the product brand. Beginning in 2008, WOW began releasing separate single-disc collections spread throughout each year, rather than a two-disc collection toward the end of each year. In addition to \"WOW Hits\", which focuses on the most popular pop and pop-rock music, plans call for either single-disc \"WOW Rock Hits\" and \"WOW Pop Hits\" collections released twice a year.\n\n\"WOW Series\" was the first and most successful series of WOW collections, and contains the following albums:\n\nIn the year 2000, the \"WOW Series\" was rebranded to \"WOW Hits\", forming the second and also the most successful series of WOW collections. In 2008, the \"WOW Series\" contemplated releasing three single discs per year instead of the annual double discs fans of the series were used to. Only one disc was ever released in the spring of 2008 before reverting to the annual format. That disc was \"WOW Hits 1\". It is not known why the publishers decided to return to the annual format instead of the three-disc format, which was inspired by the Now That's What I Call Music! series, which releases 3 discs annually. It contains the following albums:\n\n\"WOW Gospel\" are released annually, beginning with \"WOW Gospel 1998\". The focus of this series is gospel, and the compilation has been issued every year since 1998. Since the release of \"WOW Gospel 2003\", a major metropolitan city that has been influential in the field of gospel music has been honored on the album cover. For instance, New York, NY was honored due in part to the September 11, 2001 tragedy, and so on. The exception is \"WOW Gospel 2009\" in which the United States of America was honored due to the previous year's election. Another exception was when Atlanta was honored twice - first in 2007 and 2013.

The first album features songs performed by the worship leaders who wrote them, including Darlene Zschech's \"Shout to the Lord\".\nIt is a partnership between Integrity Music, Maranatha Music and Vineyard Music. After several years, it switched to a contemporary Christian music format, where CCM recording artists perform praise and worship songs in their style. The series features ten albums.\n\n\"WOW Essentials\" was first released in August 2008. It contains twelve songs that are \"essential to Christian music life.\" The first album features songs from Chris Tomlin, Casting Crowns, and many others.

The first of these, WOW 1997 the VIDEO, was a videocassette with nine music videos released in 1996. The sequel, WOW 1998, featured 16 videos. The WOW Gospel series also received home video releases.

It was formed as DHL Worldwide Express by Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn to shuttle bills of lading between Hawaii and San Francisco. It rebranded as DHL Airways in 1983 and grew rapidly, initiating services to the Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, creating a new industry of door-to-door express services in the Pacific Basin and later worldwide. Lufthansa and Japan Airlines each acquired a 5% stake, increased to 25% each in 1992. Deutsche Post acquired a 22.5% stake in 1998, gradually increasing it to 100% in 2001–2002.

The narrator, Peter Leverett, is a lawyer from the South, but the story is primarily told through the recollections of its protagonist, a troubled artist named Cass Kinsolving.\n\nThe novel's title refers to a line from one of John Donne's epigraphs:\n\"His mercies hath applied His judgments, and hath shaked the house, this body, with agues and palsies, and set this house on fire with fevers and calentures, and frightened the master of the house, which is my soul, with horrors, and heavy apprehensions, and so made an entrance into me.\"\nThis epigraph describes the basic theme of the novel: a troubled soul, the alcoholic Cass, is badly shaken by the \"fire\" of an encounter with evil, in the form of the aristocratic Mason Flagg. Ultimately, Cass' experiences with Flagg provide Cass with the inspiration he needs to redeem himself.\n\nThe story takes place in Italy, not long after the Second World War. Young southern lawyer Peter Leverett is on vacation, and is thrilled to meet his old friend Mason Flagg on a film set in the town of Sambuco. Mason is a handsome, wealthy playboy with a glamorous life style. To Peter Leverett, a good-natured, rather gullible young man, he has always been a hero. But only a few hours after their reunion, Mason is found dead. For reasons of their own, the corrupt local police quickly label his death a suicide, but Peter suspects foul play. And to his horror and dismay, the main suspect is a fellow American named Cass Kinsolving.\n\nCass Kinsolving and Peter Leverett are both southerners, but strikingly different in appearance, behavior, and social background. Mild-mannered Peter is from relatively comfortable circumstances in Virginia, while brutal, profane, violent Cass was raised in grinding poverty in rural North Carolina. Their first meeting in the town of Sambuco does not bode well for their friendship, as Cass is falling-down drunk and rudely spewing threats towards Mason Flagg and his wealthy Hollywood friends. Peter is disgusted by him at the time, but some months later he begins to be troubled by the sense that brooding, enigmatic Cass Kinsolving may know something about Mason's death. Even more disturbing are the nightmares and memories that torment Peter. Recalling various unpleasant scenes from his schooldays, he begins to wonder what horrible crimes Mason may have committed to draw down the wrath of divine justice. Finally he takes action, writing to Cass in Charleston and begging for a chance to talk about the murder and other strange events in Italy. The bulk of the novel takes the form of conversations and flashbacks that take place between the two men as they talk over past events while fishing on a lake near Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"\"What this country needs... what this great land of ours needs is something to happen to it. Something ferocious and tragic, like what happened to Jericho or the cities of the plain - something terrible I mean, son, so that when the people have been through hellfire and the crucible, and have suffered agony enough and grief, they’ll be people again, human beings, not a bunch of smug contented cows rooting at the trough.\"\" - William Styron, from \"Set This House on Fire\"\n\nLike most of Styron's works, \"Set This House on Fire\" is concerned with sex and death, as well as with aspects of Styron's personal life—in this case, the experience of growing up in Newport News, Virginia. In a historical context, the secret burden of guilt which Cass Kinsolving bears throughout the novel is intimately connected with the lingering stain of slavery on the conscience of the blood-drenched and guilty South. Ironically, Styron attempts to represent Cass' destruction of Mason as a heroic and redemptive act, even as he resorts to the oldest and most self-pitying stereotypes (the Yankee is a sniveling coward, the Southerner fearless on the field of battle.)\n\nThe novel was a success in France, but received mixed reviews in the US, some of which, such as the \"New York Times\" and \"The New Yorker\", criticized its supposed heavy-handedness (particularly in the character of Luigi, a police-officer-cum-philosopher) and slow pacing, thought to detract from the writing. Kirkus Reviews was more favorable, saying that the book was \"a complex, ambitious book which sets out to explore the limits and varieties of good and evil and in the process presents a picture of recent American life which is drawn in compelling detail and with strong authority.\"\n"}

Former prime minister Paul Martin kept a high-profile blog during his campaign for leadership of the Liberal Party. Monte Solberg kept a widely read blog while he was in opposition, but ended blogging after being named Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Former Jean Chrétien advisor, Warren Kinsella's blog enjoys a similarly high profile. The contents of political blogs have been used to both defend and attack politicians in Parliament. Canadian comedian Rick Mercer also keeps a blog that frequently pokes fun at Canadian politicians.\n\nJim Elve of Blogs Canada was the first to create a directory of Canadian blogs in the early part of this decade. Since then Allan Janssen has purchased BlogsCanada after it lay dormant for 4 years, and his company Janssen Marketing is reviving the site with the intention of making it Canada's premier news and blogging aggregator like http://www.mynewshub.com.\n\nAfter developing a rich ecosystem of individual bloggers in the early 2000s, the political part of the Canadian blogosphere began to organize itself into larger groupings as http://www.mynewshub.com based on broad political ideology (left-right politics), party alignment (New Democratic Party, Liberal, Conservative) and geographical location (province or city). Membership in several groups is common.\n\nThe largest political blog group are the right leaning Blogging Tories with some 300 blogs, including Small Dead Animals and Stephen Taylor.

These commercials ran for several months in 1991 in the United States, playing with American stereotypes of Scandinavian women being blonde and having big breasts. The premise of the commercials was that a group of bored or thirsty men were \"saved\" by the Swedish Bikini Team. Other commercials would focus on a group of men male bonding on a hunting trip and saying \"Guys, it does not get any better than this\", to which a narrator would say the man was wrong and an Old Milwaukee truck would drive miles off road towards them claiming \"it improved\", \"..and when the Swedish Bikini Team showed up, it got somewhat better.\"\n\nWhile many viewers saw the ads as a parody of traditional beer advertisements, some feminists found the ads misogynistic. Though the campaign generated widespread interest, the advertisements were dropped after protests by the National Organization for Women and female employees of the Pabst Brewing Company.\n\nWhile this advertising campaign provoked controversy, in recent years similar campaigns using attractive spokesmodels to sell beverages have followed in the U.S., with less resistance — such as the Coors twins Diane and Elaine Klimaszewski, and the \"Fantanas\": spokesmodels for Fanta soft drinks.\n\nThe Swedish Bikini Team were played by American actresses wearing platinum blonde wigs.\n\n\nThe team appeared outside of the commercial campaign on several occasions including on the cover and a pictorial in \"Playboy\" and on a \"Married... with Children\" episode, \"The Gas Station Show\". They also had a non speaking appearance on a schooner on an episode of \"The Adventures of Mark and Brian\", where Mark and Brian underwent US Coast Guard training and were attempting to impress the girls by being coasties and asking if they needed rescuing (to which their jet ski then embarrassingly capsizes).\n\nThe team, played by different actresses, also starred in the video \"\" with John Rhys-Davies.\n\nThe movies \"Dumb and Dumber\", \"Beerfest\" and \"Boat Trip\" include female Swedish teams, inspired by the originals.\n\nTeam member Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst appeared on Ken Reid's \"TV Guidance Counselor\" podcast on April 22, 2015 and discussed the Swedish Bikini Team at length.\n\n"}

Today, the term usually refers to one of two tourist attractions, the gaol which stood on Friar Gate from 1756 to 1846 and the cells of which still exist and are open to the public as a museum, and the 1843 to 1929 Vernon Street Prison whose impressive frontage can still be seen today.\nIn 1652 the Cornmarket Gaol (no longer extant) was the site of the imprisonment of George Fox on charges of blasphemy. Fox became the founder of the Christian denomination the Religious Society of Friends, perhaps better known as the Quakers. It has been alleged that Judge Bennett of Derby first used the term Quaker to describe the movement, as they bid him to 'quake for fear of the Lord', but the phrase had already been used in the context of other religious groups so the etymology is dubious.\n\nThe last person to be hanged at Derby Gaol was William Slack on 16 July 1907 for the murder of Lucy Wilson.\n\nThe Friar Gate Gaol was site of many hangings, and a small museum today displays contemporary accounts of the executions, a replica of the gallows which stood in front of the building, and a display in crime and punishment in Derbyshire, with a fine collection on the leaders of the Pentrich rising of 1817, who were hanged and beheaded on charges of treason in front of the building, following their failed revolution.\n\nThe Vernon Street Prison served as the County Gaol from 1843 to 1919, at which time it was demolished. The last public execution at Derby of Richard Thorley for the murder of Eliza Morrow took place here in 1862. From 1919 to 1929 the prison acted as a military prison. Following demolition, the site served as a Derby Greyhound Stadium, and today contains prestige offices, though the magnificent frontage is worth seeing.\n\n\n"}

The novel is historical fiction. It tells the story of an incident in a fictional New Hampshire town where a boy is suspended for humming the United States National Anthem as well as the effects of this story receiving national publicity. The main theme of the novel is the subjectivity of truth and that while individual statements may be true, taken separately they may not give an accurate picture of an event.\n\n\"Nothing But the Truth\" won a 1992 Newbery Honor. The novel was later adapted into a play.\n\nPhilip Malloy is a track-obsessed ninth grader at Harrison High School in New Hampshire. After receiving a D grade on his English test, Phillip Malloy blames it on his English teacher, Margaret Narwin. Since he is no longer eligible to try out for the track team, he avoids telling his parents and instead pretends that he no longer has an interest in trying out. Throughout his time in school, his number of class time disturbances increases. \n\nOne day, he begins humming the national anthem when he's meant to be at silent respectful attention. Ms. Narwin asks him to stop multiple times. \n\nAfter three days of this behavior, he is suspended and given the chance to apologize to Narwin for his disrespect towards her. After Philip refuses to express regret, Vice Principal Dr. Joseph Palleni is called by district mandated procedure to suspend him.\n\nPhilip then tells his parents that he was suspended for 'singing' the National Anthem. Mr. Malloy (Philip's father), shares this with their neighbor, Ted, who is running for the school board. He arranges an interview between Philip and a local journalist named Jennifer Stewart.\n\nMs. Stewart pursues Philip's story about suspension, going on to speak to many of the adults involved: the school superintendent, Dr. Albert Seymour (who says adamantly that there is no policy against singing the national anthem but is not aware of the context), the principal Dr. Gertrude Doane (who received a short memo on the subject), the assistant principal Dr. Joseph Palleni (who is defensive about his level of involvement), and Ms. Narwin, who does not give her any comment on the situation.\n\nMs. Narwin's slanted newspaper article quickly garners national attention when it is picked up by the Associated Press. Philip and his 'anthem singing' controversy are soon elevated into the national media spotlight; leading many to laud him for his patriotism and condemn the school's (alleged) attempts to stymie it. Meanwhile, Harrison School District faces a critical school board election bearing significant implications over the school's finances. With funding already in shortage, there is an urgent concern that the school could suffer greatly from further budget cuts. A reporter attempts to cover Ms. Narwin's side of the story, but her article is buried during an international crisis. In the midst of the controversy, Ms. Narwin is asked to 'take a break from teaching,' and she reluctantly agrees. This is soon followed by her resignation and she leaves to visit her sister in Jakeville. \n\nAfter using Philip's story as a platform, Ted Griffen is elected to the Harrison School district school board. At this point, he declines to extend much-needed funding to Harrison High School in a demonstration of disapproval for their handling of the incident. \n\nWhen Philip returns to school, he has trouble adjusting to his dubious notoriety and becomes an outcast. \n\nHis role in the dismissal of Ms. Narwin and his invitation of a media firestorm on the Harrison community fuel feelings of resentment toward him from his peers. He is harassed by other students both on the bus and in the classroom while his crush, Allison, openly resents him for the removal of her favorite teacher, Ms. Narwin.\n\nMatters decline further as Philip is informed by a friend that the student body has begun drafting a petition with the intention to compel him into revealing the truth about the incident (an idea that originated from the track coach, Coach Jamison). This propels Philip into a breaking point and he begins skipping school, causing concern from his parents.\n\nPhilip ultimately decides to transfer to a private school, Washington Academy (despite protests from his father, as the tuition would use up all of his college funds and savings). \n\nAt Philip's new school, he is asked to lead his classmates in singing \"The National Anthem\" At that moment, he starts to cry and admits, \"I don't know the words.\", ending the book.\n"}

Vororte usually have their own business centre. They are the remainders of formerly separate neighbour towns, or have been founded as satellite towns. The term is contrasted with \"Vorstadt\", which describes a more densely populated area grown at the outline of a city centre.\n\nIn Swiss history, \"Vorort\" referred to the temporary \"presidency\" of a canton or the cantonal capital. During the Old Swiss Confederacy, the canton or city that convened the Tagsatzung and chaired it was called the \"Vorort\". In the 15th century, the city of Zürich became the \"de facto\" Vorort of the Confederacy. Since the Reformation in Switzerland, Lucerne became the Vorort of the Catholic cantons. With the 1798 establishment of the Helvetic Republic the Vororte were abolished and instead Aarau was made capital city, then Lucerne, then Bern. After the Act of Mediation, the \"Vorort of Switzerland\" would rotate each year between the capital of Aarau and the cities of Zürich, Bern, Lucerne, Fribourg, Solothurn and Basel. In 1815, the choice of Vororte was restricted to Zürich, Bern and Lucerne, who in turn served as biennial seat of government until 1847.

It lies in the middle of the triangle bounded by Redruth, Helston and Falmouth. Its population (2001) is 2,004, increasing to 2,101 at the 2011 census An electoral ward in the same name also exists but stretches north to St Day. The population here also at the 2011 census was 5,023.\n\nThe parish is mainly agricultural, lying south of the Gwennap mining area and north of the quarrying areas of Rame and Longdowns. The River Kennall runs through the parish: in the 19th century, this river worked a flour mill and a number of gunpowder mills, machinery at a foundry, and a paper mill.\n\nThe parish church is dedicated to St Stythian, but it is hard to identify this saint. References to the parish in 13th and 14th century records show various spellings: Stethyana, Stediana, Stedyan, Stediane, and Stidianus. The Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould's \"Cornish Dedications\" (1906) makes a connection with St Etaine of Tumna in Ireland, while Rev Michael Warner (Vicar of Stithians 1983-1993) suggests St Stephen. The saint's feast day is the Sunday nearest 10 July, and Stithians Show is held on the Monday following Feast Sunday.\n\nThere has been a church on the site since the 6th century, but the oldest part of the current church is 14th century; and the imposing tower was added in the 15th century. The former ecclesiastical parish of Carnmenellis is now merged with Stithians parish. The church has a large two manual pipe organ.\n\nThere are four Cornish crosses in the parish; they are in the vicarage garden, and at Repper's Mill and Trevalis. The cross at Repper's Mill has a crude crucifixus figure on the front and a Latin cross on the back. There are two crosses at Trevalis: both have a crude crucifixus figure on the front and a Latin cross on the back. One of the crosses formerly stood at Hendra Hill near the churchtown but was moved to Trevalis about 1860. Another cross stands in the grounds of Tretheague House.\n\nJohn Wesley visited Stithians in 1744-50 and brought Methodism to the parish. The Hendra Wesleyan Chapel was built in 1815 and after a division among the members, the Penmennor United Methodist Free Church was built in 1866 just a few yards away (Hendra Chapel closed in 1976).\n\nStithians Show is one of the largest one-day agricultural shows in the UK: the show is held annually in July and the attendance is in excess of 20,000. Established in 1834, it has been held continuously since then (except for three years during World War I, and five years during World War II; and there was no show in 2001 due to the nationwide outbreak of foot and mouth disease). Up until 1992, the Show was sited on fields in the centre of the village. Then the threat of rental increases as well as the show's increasing size encouraged the Agricultural Association to purchase its own land at Kennall Farm and establish a site there.\n\nMusic has always played a large part in village life. St Stythians Band (formerly St Stythians Silver Band) was founded in 1928 and became very successful in competitions in the 1960s and 1970s; during the summer months it gives weekly concerts at the Gyllyngdune Gardens in Falmouth. St Stythians Male Voice Choir was formed in 1919, only to be closed in 1926; but it was reformed in 1947 and since then has thrived, performing concerts throughout Cornwall and further afield. Stithians Ladies Choir was formed in 1966 and quickly established a high reputation. The band and choirs have made a number of successful recordings.\n\nAlbert Collins (1859–1937) from Stithians travelled to South Africa in 1880 with his friend William Mountstephens from Falmouth; there their building business prospered and they contributed to many charitable institutions. In 1934, Albert Collins paid for the Playing Field, opposite the school in the centre of the village, which is still enjoyed by the children of Stithians today. The men also set up a Trust Fund under the control of the Methodist Church in South Africa, which was used to build a school in Johannesburg; the school, known as St Stithians College, opened in 1953.\n\nStithians Dam was completed in 1964 to create a reservoir to the west of the village, which supplies water to a large part of the west of Cornwall. It is a place for bird-watching, fishing and water sports. Stithians has a rugby football club (founded in 1890) and a football club running two teams in the Trelawny League.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She attended a Catholic grammar school and Norristown High School. \n\nWorking in Los Angeles in a production of \"Auntie Mame\", she was approached by an Australian television producer who asked her if she 'wanted to come to Australia and be funny'. She was contracted for six months, and appeared as a regular on a Melbourne television variety show, \"Daly at Night\", 'a female Victor Borge, singing off-key and just plain acting like a dumb brunette'. She was known in Australia in the early 1960s as 'Betty Bobbitt from Big Bear', referencing a fictitious place ostensibly in Pennsylvania.\n\nShe subsequently married an Australian artist, Robin Hill, and had a son, Christopher, in England.Returning to Australia she appeared in many theatre productions with the Melbourne Theatre Company.\n\nBobbitt has been a fixture on Australian television since the 1970s with guest roles in serials including \"Matlock Police\", \"Homicide\", \"A Country Practice\", \"The Flying Doctors\", \"All Saints\", \"Marshall Law\" and \"Blue Heelers\".

[...] Big Daddy Kane, the original...you can't think Brooklyn or door knockers and not think Big Daddy Kane, smooth operator: one of hip-hop's pioneers. LL Cool J, one of the first MC's to really dissect lyrics and turn them inside out; and he made it sexy! MC Lyte, the female MC that rhymes in such a way that you don’t care if she was male or female...her voice tone is crazy, and her lyrical game bananas. Queen Latifah, she represented the strong female MC, she showed us and taught us about flow and lyrical dexterity. Kid 'n Play, they showed you how to take your rap game to the next level...movies!\"\n\nIn May 2009, Cole began dating former NBA player Daniel Gibson. They were engaged on January 1, 2010.

Since the 2011 local government reform \"Kallikratis\" it is part of the municipality of Apokoronas, serving as its historical capital. It is situated on a small hill at an altitude of above sea level, about from Chania. In Vamos, one can find several restaurants, snack bars and shops in the village, as well as many public services, such as a fully equipped health center, schools, police station and the regional court for the regions of Apokoronas and Sfakia.\n\nThe village is said to have been founded by Arab invaders during the 8th century, which sought refuge in Crete after being expelled from Andalusia. The first official record of the name (Vamo/Vamu) is found on a map of 1577 made by Francesco Barozzi, and according to the Venetian census of 1583 it had 271 inhabitants. The village followed the fate of the rest of Western Crete when the Ottomans invaded the broader area of Apokoronas in 1646 and remained relatively small until the mid-19th century.\n\nAccording to the Egyptian census of 1834, it is mentioned as Vamos, being inhabited by 30 Christian and 15 Muslim families. Due to its strategic position over the main road from Chania to Rethimno and Heraklion, the village became the seat of a municipality in 1881, and in 1866 Vamos was chosen by Savva Paşa as the capital of the Liva (District) of Sfakia. Within the next years, the village went through a period of increased development, which saw the construction of new public buildings with neoclassical elements, such as the Governorate (Konak/Seray), the Ottoman barracks, water tanks and schools, among which the famous Parthenagogio (Girls' School), which today functions as a municipal hostel. Most of the judicial, political, and military authorities of the broader area were seated in the village. Therefore it is often found in public documents of the era as Saraylıköy, which means \"the village with the palace.\"\n\nFor exactly the same reason, the village repeatedly became the target of Christian revolutionaries during the numerous Cretan revolts of the 19th century. Many of its buildings suffered great damage during the revolt of 1878, which were restored by Mahmut Paşa in 1892. One of the most renown events, however, is the siege and fall of Vamos to the revolutionaries under Leonidas Malekakis (Papamalekos) during the revolt of 1895-6, an event that forced the Greek government to revise its policy on the Cretan Question and the European Powers to intervene decisively for its settlement. The result was a preliminary treaty between the revolutionaries and the Ottoman authorities in 1896, which was soon to be followed by the last revolt of 1897 and the withdrawal of the Ottoman army, allowing the creation of the Cretan State, a de facto independent state which remained typically under Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars of 1912-3, when it eventually united with Greece.\n\nRight below the main square at the top of the hill, one can find the old quarter of Vamos. A group of locals decided to set up here Vamos SA, an enterprise devoted to preserving local heritage and customs, by encouraging a sustainable form of tourism. In this context, several old houses have been refurbished in order to provide accommodation for visitors, and within the next few years, a few tavernas showed up, an art gallery, some picturesque cafés, and a general store selling local products.\n\nThe municipal unit Vamos extends over , and consists of 9 communities. The community Vamos extends over and includes the nearby village of Douliana. The municipal unit Vamos consists of the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):\n\nApproximately 3,400 residents inhabit the municipal unit of Vamos.\n\nThe High School of Vamos was first established in 1901 by the authorities of the Cretan State, being one of the twenty Greek schools established during this era. Although it started with only three classes, it was soon obtained one more in 1911–1912, a fifth one in 1912–1913 and sixth the next year, thus becoming a complete high school. The existent building is the second building of the high school, and it was completed in 1936, with Sifakis being its director. It is located right above the main settlement of Vamos, at exactly the same place where the Ottoman Directorate (Konak) used to be. During World War II (1941–45) the building became a Nazi barracks and headquarters for the province of Apokoronas. In 1949, two more classes were built upon the donation of Dimitrios Lambrakis (ancestor of the Media-Tycoon Christos Lambrakis), and therefore his name was given to the high school, being known as \"Lambrakio Gymnasio Vamou.\"\n\n\n"}

The Adelphi was located at 152 West 54th Street in Manhattan, with 1,434 seats. The theater was taken over by the Federal Theater Project in 1934 and renamed the Adelphi. The theater was renamed the Radiant Center by The Royal Fraternity of Master Metaphysicians in 1940. It was then the Yiddish Arts Theater (1943), and renamed the Adelphi Theater on April 20, 1944, when it was acquired by the Shuberts. \n\nIt became a DuMont Television Network studio, known as the Adelphi Tele-Theatre in the 1950s. The \"Classic 39\" episodes of \"The Honeymooners\" were filmed in this facility by DuMont using their Electronicam system for broadcast on CBS later during the 1955–56 television season. The theater returned to legitimate use in 1957, was renamed the 54th Street Theater in 1958, and finally the George Abbott Theater in 1965. The building was demolished in 1970 for the New York Hilton Hotel, after hosting several expensive flops.\n\nHilton New York owned the property immediately west of the hotel and held it for expansion. In 1989 an office tower 1325 Avenue of the Americas was built on the site. The building uses its Hilton Sixth Avenue address although it is closer to Seventh Avenue.

In popular culture the building is used for the exterior shot of Elaine's office in \"Seinfeld\".\n\n\nMusical theater star William Gaxton (\"Anything Goes\", \"Of Thee I Sing\", \"A Connecticut Yankee\", etc.) referred to it as \"the dump of dumps\".

On 9 December 2010, Anne, Princess Royal officially opened the venue which is owned and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority. The £31 million ($50 million US) project to construct the centre finished on schedule and was the first newly constructed Olympic venue to be completed.\n\nThe venue is located between the towns of Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire and Waltham Abbey in Essex. The site is just outside the northern boundary of Greater London and north-west of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. It is in the heart of River Lee Country Park which is part of the , long Lee Valley Park. The venue opened in late 2010 offering canoeing and rafting activities to the public ahead of the London 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe venue has a purpose-built slalom course for the Olympic white-water canoe events (flatwater canoeing and kayaking events took place at Dorney Lake, Buckinghamshire, west of London). The main competition channel is an international- and Olympic-standard 300-metre canoe and kayak slalom course. It and the shorter warm-up course empty into the warm-up and cool-down lake. The white water is created by a system of pumps which lift water into the two start pools. All of the water contained in the system is slightly chlorinated in order to retain water quality. During the Games, temporary seating was installed around the venue for 12,000 spectators.\n\nThe 300-metre competition course has a drop of 5.5 metres (18 ft), for an average slope of 1.8% (18 m/km or 95 ft/mile) and a pump-powered streamflow of 13 cubic metres per second (460 cubic feet per second). The intermediate/warm-up course is 160 metres long with a drop of 1.6 metres and flow of 10.5 cubic metres per second. A 10,000-square-metre lake, filled with groundwater, supplies the water for the pumps. Lee Valley Regional Park Authority hope to bring in up to £45,000 per day from visitors to offset the energy cost of pumping the water.\n\nThe course is sited within a new landscaped parkland setting, including path and bridge networks to enable spectators to have access and view the events (landscaping works were carried out by Tilbrooks Landscapes.). A new facility building houses reception, café, changing rooms, shop, offices, spectator viewing, equipment storage and water pump and filtration facilities.\n\nLee Valley White Water Centre was the only brand new London 2012 venue available for public use before the Games. On 8 September 2012 it became the first London 2012 venue to reopen to the public. The centre is intended to provide canoeing and rafting activities for users of all abilities who will be able to take advantage of the Olympic and intermediate course. The venue is owned, funded and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority; it will join the other London 2012 venues – the Velopark, Hockey Centre and Tennis centre at Eton Manor – that the Park Authority will also own, fund and manage in legacy.\n\nTwo gate sets were used for the Olympic Games, one for the first two days (left) and another for the last three days (right). Each gate set had six upstream gates (red numbers), but gate #12 of the first set was a flush gate with the second pole directly downstream of the first. Paddlers entered gate #12 from the left wall side and exited into the main current. Gate #18 of the second set was a downstream flush gate, with entrance from the flow and exit into the eddy. A 90-degree right turn direct from #18 to #19 was faster than the 270-degree eddy spin used by many contenders. All the gates were double-pole. There was no use of single-pole gates.\n\nOlympic Results.\n\nThe venue opened again to the public after the Games as part of the Olympic Legacy Works. Spectator seating was removed and the venue returned to providing a leisure attraction for canoeing and white-water rafting and a competition venue for elite events, to be managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority. In April 2011 it was confirmed that the centre would host the 2015 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships.\nA£6.3 million redevelopment project was completed in February 2014 leading to the creation of new visitor facilities and new offices and training base for the GB Canoe Slalom team.\n\nThe main facility building is designed by FaulknerBrowns Architects. The canoe course is located within a wider parkland setting designed by U.S.-based landscape architects Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. White-water course specialists Whitewater Parks International, working with civil and structural engineers Cundall, are the designers of the white-water courses. Indigo Planning were the planning consultants and managed the preparation of the Environmental Statement. Stage D of the design process was completed by Morrison Construction The Team of S2o Design and Engineering and Engineering Paddler Designs completed the detail design of the white-water channel itself. The detail design of the white-water channel involved the creation of a 1:10 Froude scaled physical model that resulted in numerous changes to the initial white-water channel design. One of these changes was the conceptualization, design and implementation of the RapidBlocs Obstacle system. The RapidBlocs system allows course operators to reconfigure the placement of boulders, eddies, and rapids to meet design objectives. S2o and EPD were further responsible for course tuning and commissioning.\n\nFollowing nomination from Broxbourne Borough Council, Lee Valley White Water Centre won a special commendation at the 2011 Hertfordshire Building Futures Awards in recognition of the excellence of its design in meeting the needs of the sport, and the understated addition it makes to its parkland setting.\n\nThe centre has also won or been shortlisted for the following awards: 2012 winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects East Spirit of Ingenuity Award; 2012 winner of Secured by Design Award; 2011 Essex Tourism Awards (shortlisted) Best Large Attraction and Best Tourism Experience.\n\nThe site is located just off the A121 road, with easy access from the A10 road, and junctions 25 and 26 of the M25 motorway.\n\nRail access to the site is via Cheshunt and Waltham Cross railway stations on the West Anglia Main Line, with frequent services from Stratford, near the main Olympic site, and Liverpool Street. Theobalds Grove railway station, on the Lea Valley Lines, is nearby.\n\nArriva Herts and Essex operates services 66,86,251 which pass close to the venue. Other bus routes run by Transport for London and Intalink stop at the nearby bus station in Waltham Cross town centre.\n\nThe Lee Navigation towpath forms part of the Lee Valley Walk and the National Cycle Route 1 is adjacent to the venue.\n\nFull video of Olympic competition\n"}

It is located on 5th Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets in the Sunset Park neighborhood and occupies half the length of the block between 5th and 6th Avenues, with the rectory and ancillary buildings occupying the remainder of the blocks. The Basilica is visible from the Gowanus Expressway two blocks west. It is popularly referred to by its initials, OLPH. The parish celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2017.\n\nThe parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help was established by Bishop Charles Edward McDonnell in November 1892 to serve the residents of the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn. It was formed from the parishes of Our Lady of Angels and St. Michael. The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists) purchased land, bordered by 59th and 60th Streets and by Fifth and Sixth Avenues in what was then a relatively rural area. The first Mass was celebrated on Easter Sunday, April 2, 1893 in the Morse family house on 54th Street and 4th Avenue. A wooden frame church on Fifth Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets was dedicated by Bishop Charles Edward McDonnell on January 14, 1894. \n\nThe Redemptorists hold a particular regard for Mary, under the title Our Lady of Perpetual Help. On May 6, 1894 they established the devotion in the parish, distributing prayer cards. The following December a copy of the icon of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, brought from Rome, was installed in the new church. The perpetual novena to Mary under the title of Our Lady of Perpetual Help continues.\n\nConstruction on the current church began in 1907. The lower level was opened for services two years later, with the upper church completed in 1928. The Church was designated a minor Basilica on November 1, 1969.\n\nAt the time of its completion, the parish was largely Irish in character (as evidenced by the inscriptions on the memorial windows). It was built on what was known as Irish Hill. Some of the family names include Collins, Brennan, Wade, Connors, Burns, McCaffrey, Healy, and Coffey. There is still an Irish presence, but today it is predominantly Hispanic and Chinese. The Basilica enjoys large attendance, particularly on holidays such as Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday and Christmas. \n\nThe parish offers immigration services in its Juan Neumann Center, operates a food pantry, hosts a Chinese senior citizen group and leases space to benefit the community to a pre-k program and Lutheran Medical Center.\n\nThe basilica, founded and still staffed by the Redemptorists, is a Roman Catholic parish church of the Diocese of Brooklyn. It is dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and serves as a pro-cathedral. The architect was Franz Joseph Untersee of Boston. The granite church is Romanesque with a limestone exterior. As a \"double chapel\", the basilica has two floors of worship, like the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi. The upstairs church was commonly only used to host weddings and special group services such as confirmation and communion, but has come back into more frequent use. For many years, mass in Spanish was held upstairs because of the large number of parishioners in attendance. Masses are also celebrated in Chinese and Vietnamese. The lower level is for smaller services. The first floor has been renovated many times in recent years. \n\nBecause of its size, the Basilica hosts major diocesan services (e.g., ordinations) that would otherwise be held at Brooklyn's other, considerably smaller basilica, the Cathedral Basilica of St. James. For the same reason, it also hosts sadder events; it is a venue-of-choice for the larger funerals of those who have fallen in the line of duty while in the service of the New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department.\n\nThe parish has an elementary school down the block on 6th Avenue and 59th and 60th Street. OLPH elementary school opened September 9, 1903 and was staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood. The school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2003. From 1956 until 1999 there was an OLPH Commercial High School for girls. Students at both were taught by the Sisters of St. Joseph, whose convent is on 59th Street and 6th Avenue. A rectory for the Redemptorist priests is on 59th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. \n\nIn 2012, the not-for-profit Regina Opera Company moved to the auditorium of OLPH Catholic Academy.\n\nThe Basilica is served by the New York City Subway's BMT Fourth Avenue Line at the 59th Street subway station ().\n\nChuck Connors, of \"The Rifleman\", grew up in the neighborhood and served as an altar boy at OLPH.\n\n"}

Located in the suburb of Milltown, it was home to Shamrock Rovers from 1926 to 1987, when it was sold to property developers by the club's directors. It is now a housing estate called Glenmalure Square.\n\nShamrock Rovers moved from the inner city area of Ringsend in the early 20th century to the then semi-rural suburb of Milltown. In Milltown, Rovers secured a long term lease of land from the Jesuit Order, who were based in the area. The club's ground there was largely built by their supporters, who constructed the main stand and banked the areas on the other three sides. It was officially opened on Sunday 19 September 1926, with a friendly game against Belfast Celtic in front of a crowd of 18,000. Bob Fullam had the honour of scoring Rovers first ever goal at the ground.\n\nWhen the Cunningham family took over the club in the 1930s, the stadium was named Glenmalure Park in honour of the Cunningham's ancestral home in the Glenmalure valley in the Wicklow Mountains. The Cunninghams completed the ground by terracing the remainder of the ground and erecting a roof over the terrace opposite the main stand. Glenmalure Park remained almost unaltered from then until its demolition in 1990, apart from the demolition of a small area of terracing beside the main stand and the erection of floodlights in the early 1980s. The capacity of the stadium was about 20,000 (with around 1000 seats) for most of its existence, its record crowd being 28,000 people for a game against Waterford in 1968. However, bigger crowds than this were sometimes seen at the venue before this, but went unreported by the club's owners. However, with modern safety precautions its capacity would probably have been considerably less. The ground's last full house came in 1986, when 18,000 attended a European Cup match against Glasgow Celtic. Temporary stands had to be erected for this game.\n\nIn 1978 Glenmalure Park hosted its first European game when Apoel Nicosia were defeated 2-0. In all seven European games were played there as well as 1988 Summer Olympics qualifiers.\n\nIn 1987, the Kilcoyne family, who owned Shamrock Rovers since 1972 and had recently bought Glenmalure Park from the Jesuits, decided to sell the stadium to property developers. They stated that their aim was to move Rovers to Tolka Park to share with Home Farm F.C.. The last match at Milltown was an FAI Cup semi-final between Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers on Sunday 12 April 1987, attended by some 6,000 people. This game saw a pitch invasion and protest by fans objecting to the sale of the ground. Some Shamrock Rovers supporters occupied the pitch at half-time were joined by Sligo fans in solidarity. They had to be persuaded to leave the pitch before the game could restart.\n\nThe following season Shamrock Rovers fans formed an organisation called 'Keep Rovers at Milltown' (KRAM) and placed a picket on home games at Tolka Park, effectively bankrupting the club's owners. KRAM collected money to purchase Glenmalure Park but could not match the offer of a property developer to whom the Kilcoynes eventually sold the site. After a lengthy appeals process, Glenmalure Park was demolished in the summer of 1990 and an apartment complex was built there. It is now marked by a permanent memorial erected by Shamrock Rovers supporters on Thursday 21 May 1998.\n\nOn Thursday 12 April 2007 a ceremony was held at the monument to commemorate 20 years since the last competitive game was played at the famous old ground.\n\nThe sale of Glenmalure Park featured in the RTÉ programme \"Twenty Moments That Shook Irish Sport\" which was broadcast in August 2007. The feature came in for some criticism on the basis of its factual correctness and bias in favour of the Kilcoynes. The last game at Milltown was featured on RTÉ's Monday Night Soccer show on 14 April 2008.\n\nShamrock Rovers were without a home ground for over 20 years after the sale of Glenmalure Park, until the opening of Tallaght Stadium in March 2009.\n\nShamrock Rovers F.C. and the Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust marked the 25th anniversary of the last game at Glenmalure Park in Milltown with a Stadium to Stadium Walk in April 2012 .\n\nFour other League of Ireland clubs played home matches at Glenmalure Park – Shelbourne United in the 1923–24 season, Reds United in the 1935–36 season, Shelbourne from 1949–51, and St Patrick's Athletic from 1951-54.\n\nThe ground also hosted a boxing event in August 1966\n\n\n"}

He developed through the youth academies at Žalgiris Kaunas, where he was tabbed as one of the top young players in the game. He played in 15 Euroleague games for the club during the 2004–05 season, and was originally projected to be one of the top picks in the 2005 NBA draft, but a disappointing season in Europe, and an apparent lack of improvement, sent his draft stock spiraling down. That season, he averaged 1.5 points and 1.1 rebounds per game, in 8.7 minutes played per game in the Euroleague.\n\nAndriuškevičius was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the 44th pick in the 2005 NBA draft.

On December 21, as a member of the NBA Development League's Dakota Wizards, Andriuškevičius sustained a serious head injury, when he was punched by teammate Awvee Storey, in an attack during practice in Bismarck, North Dakota. The center suffered a fractured skull, a severe concussion, and a two-centimeter hematoma (bruise) on the left side of his brain. Doctors initially thought it would be months before he could speak, but he was able to regain speech within a month, and stated his desire to play basketball within a year. Storey was suspended indefinitely. Days later, Storey had his contract terminated, and he was dismissed from the league. Andriuškevičius did not wish to pursue charges.\n\nOn March 12, 2007, Chicago Bulls doctor's cleared Andriuškevičius to participate in contact practices. The \"Chicago Tribune\" said it was, \"a remarkable recovery from the serious brain injury\". On April 6, head coach Scott Skiles, considered moving the player to the active roster, as he soon started practicing. However, Andriuškevičius never logged a regular season appearance for the Bulls.\n\nOn August 11, 2007, Andriuškevičius' agent announced that he would play with Joventut Badalona, and he signed with the team five days later, but his contract with the team was cancelled shortly after.\n\nIn September 2011, he signed a one-year contract with PAOK in Greece. On 11 January 2016, he signed with former Telemach League champions KK Helios Suns, on a two-year contract.\n\nAt the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Andriuškevičius played with the senior men's the Lithuanian national basketball team, and with them he won a bronze medal.\n\n\n"}

In computer graphics, it is commonly used to create textures and 3D models. In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include smaller file sizes, larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay. Procedural generation is a branch of media synthesis.\n\nThe term \"procedural\" refers to the process that computes a particular function. Fractals are geometric patterns which can often be generated procedurally. Commonplace procedural content includes textures and meshes. Sound is often also procedurally generated, and has applications in both speech synthesis as well as music. It has been used to create compositions in various genres of electronic music by artists such as Brian Eno who popularized the term \"generative music\".\n\nWhile software developers have applied procedural generation techniques for years, few products have employed this approach extensively. Procedurally generated elements have appeared in earlier video games: \"\" takes place in a mostly procedurally generated world, giving a world roughly two thirds the actual size of the British Isles. \"Soldier of Fortune\" from Raven Software uses simple routines to detail enemy models, while featured a randomly-generated level mode. Avalanche Studios employed procedural generation to create a large and varied group of detailed tropical islands for \"Just Cause\". \"No Man's Sky\", a game developed by games studio Hello Games, is all based upon procedurally generated elements.\n\nThe modern demoscene uses procedural generation to package a great deal of audiovisual content into relatively small programs.\n\nNew methods and applications are presented annually in conferences such as the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games and Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment.\n\nParticularly in the application of procedural generation with video games, which are intended to be highly replayable, there are concerns that procedural systems can generate infinite numbers of worlds to explore, but without sufficient human guidance and rules to guide these, the result becomes \"procedural oatmeal\", a term coined by writer Kate Compton, in that while it is possible to mathematically generate thousands of bowls of oatmeal with procedural generation, they will be perceived to be the same by the user, and lack the notion of perceived uniqueness that a procedural system should aim for.\n\nUsing procedural generation in games had origins in the tabletop role playing game (RPG) venue. The leading tabletop system, \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\", provided ways for the \"game master\" to generate dungeons and terrain using random die rolls, expanded in later editions with complex branching procedural tables. Strategic Simulations under license from TSR released the \"Dungeon Master's Assistant\", a computer program that generated dungeons based on these published tables. \"Tunnels & Trolls\", also published by TSR, was designed primarily around solitary play and used similar procedural generation for its dungeons. Other tabletop RPGs borrowed similar concepts in procedural generation for various world elements.\n\nPrior to graphically oriented video games, roguelike games, a genre directly inspired by \"Dungeons & Dragons\" adopted for solitaire play, heavily utilized procedural generation in the same manner that tabletop systems had done. Such early games include \"Beneath Apple Manor\" (1978) and the genre's namesake, \"Rogue\" (1980). The procedural generation system in roguelikes would create dungeons in ASCII- or regular tile-based systems and define rooms, hallways, monsters, and treasure to challenge the player. Roguelikes, and games based on the roguelike concepts, allow the development of complex gameplay without having to spend excessive time in creating a game's world.\n\n1978's \"Maze Craze\" for the Atari VCS used an algorithm to generate a random, top-down maze for each game.\n\nSome games used pseudorandom number generators. These PNGs were often used with predefined seed values in order to generate very large game worlds that appeared to be premade. \"The Sentinel\" supposedly had 10,000 different levels stored in only 48 and 64 kilobytes. An extreme case was \"Elite\", which was originally planned to contain a total of 2 (approximately 282 trillion) galaxies with 256 solar systems each. However, the publisher was afraid that such a gigantic universe would cause disbelief in players, and eight of these galaxies were chosen for the final version.\nOther notable early examples include the 1985 game \"Rescue on Fractalus\" that used fractals to procedurally create, in real time, the craggy mountains of an alien planet and \"River Raid\", the 1982 Activision game that used a pseudorandom number sequence generated by a linear feedback shift register in order to generate a scrolling maze of obstacles.\n\nThough modern computer games do not have the same memory and hardware restrictions that earlier games had, the use of procedural generation is frequently employed to create randomized games, maps, levels, characters, or other facets that are unique on each playthrough.\n\nIn 2004, a PC first-person shooter called \".kkrieger\" was released by a German demo group. It is entirely contained in a 96 kilobyte executable for Microsoft Windows that generates hundreds of megabytes of 3D and texture data when run. According to one of the programmers, \"it was a complete failure as far as the game side was concerned (mostly because no-one involved really deeply cared about that aspect).\"\n\nNaked Sky's \"RoboBlitz\" used procedural generation to maximize content in a less than 50 MB downloadable file for Xbox Live Arcade. Will Wright's \"Spore\" also makes use of procedural synthesis.\n\nProcedural generation is often used in loot systems of quest-driven games, such as action role-playing games and massive multiplayer online role playing games. Though quests may feature fixed rewards, other loot, such as weapons and armor, may be generated for the player based on the player-character's level, the quest's level, their performance in the quest, and other random factors. This often leads to loot having a rarity quality applied to reflect when the procedural generation system has produced an item with better-than-average attributes. For example, the \"Borderlands\" series is based on its procedural generation system which can create over a million unique guns and other equipment.\n\nMany open world or survival games procedurally create a game world from a random seed or one provided by the player, so that each playthrough is different. These generation systems create numerous pixel- or voxel-based biomes with distribution of resources, objects, and creatures. The player frequently has the ability to adjust some of the generation parameters, such as specifying the amount of water coverage in a world. Examples of such games include \"Dwarf Fortress\" and \"Minecraft\". An artifact of the procedural generation around these games is that if the space that the player is allowed to explore is not limited, the randomness of the procedural generation will start to produce more noise than content; this is exemplified in the idea of the \"Far Lands\" within some earlier versions of \"Minecraft\", where the usual smooth transitions between biomes was replaced with haphazard formations.\n\nProcedural generation is also used in space exploration and trading games. \"\", through using the 400 billion known stars of the Milky Way Galaxy as its world basis, uses procedural generation to simulate the planets in these solar systems. Similarly, Star Citizen uses the technology for its planets, to create a collection of seamlessly-loaded planet-sized planets among its hand-crafted universe. \"I-Novae Infinity\" features a plethora of planets which are procedurally generated between which the player can travel via space ships. \"Outerra Anteworld\" is a video game in development that uses procedural generation and real world data to create a virtual replica of planet Earth in true scale. \"No Man's Sky\" features a universe containing 18 quintillion planets which are procedurally generated on the fly as the player encounters them, including their terrain, weather, flora, and fauna, as well as a number of space-faring alien species. This universe is defined by the use of a single random seed number to their deterministic engine, assuring that the same content will be generated at the same places for all players, which enables players to share discoveries using only knowledge of the locations of the planets in the virtual galaxy.\n\nAs in video games, procedural generation is often used in film to create visually interesting and accurate spaces rapidly. This comes in a wide variety of applications.\n\nOne application is known as an \"imperfect factory\", where artists can rapidly generate many similar objects. This accounts for the fact that, in real life, no two objects are ever exactly alike. For instance, an artist could model a product for a grocery store shelf, and then create an imperfect factory to generated many similar objects to populate the shelf.\n\nMASSIVE is a high-end computer animation and artificial intelligence software package used for generating crowd-related visual effects for film and television. It was developed to create fighting armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers for Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" films automatically.\n\nCoherent noise can be extremely important to procedural workflow in film. Simplex noise is often faster with fewer artifacts, though an older function called Perlin noise may be used as well. Coherent noise, in this case, refers to a function that generates smooth pseudo-randomness in n dimensions.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2215642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215642", "title": "Ultimate Soldier", "text": "Ultimate Soldier\n\nThe Ultimate Soldier was produced by the company known as 21st Century Toys. It was founded in 1997, and began making 1/6 scale figures and uniforms, and now mostly makes 1/6 scale weapon sets as well as 1/18 and 1/32 scale toys. The action figures are based on World War Two, Vietnam War, Korean War, and Operation Desert Storm soldiers.\n\nIn 1997, 21st Century Toys decided to create a \"12\" inch soldier with more detailed accessories than Hasbro's G.I. Joe. 21st Century Toys Ultimate soldier early packaging utilized the art of Illustrator designer Malcom West. As the line became more popular with collectors, West became the overall packaging art director and brought in Creative Resolutions, a firm in Oakland California owned by Michelle Fie. The company decided to create a separate box design catered to each figure, using graphic treatments tailored to the figure. These independent designs were created and handled by lead designer Jeff Blosch. Well established Illustrator Marc Ericksen, a combat veteran of two years served in Viet Nam, and having created box art for nearly 100 video games, was contracted to create the illustrations for eighteen of the figures covering World War II, Viet Nam, the current Middle East actions, and Law Enforcement. The packaging featured an exciting full battle Scene, along with design motifs from the theater of action relative to the figure. This attention to detail drove the desire of collectors and created strong sales of the figures. The combat figures included: For WWII: U.S. 101st Airborne Pathfinder,British 8th Army Bren Gunner,U.S. First Infantry Bazooka gunner, German Das Afrika Korps Infantryman,German Infantry Officer, Monte Cassino, U.S. Marine Raider, Pacific Theater,U.S. Tank Commander N.C,O. Battle of the Bulge,German Wehrmacht Machine gunner,U.S. Marine Medic, Japanese Infantryman, Pacific Theater, German Fallschurmjager Gran Sasso raid.For Vietnam: U.S. Special Forces Mike Force officer, Viet Cong Cadre rifleman, North Vietnamese infantryman, U.S. Navy SEAL recon. For Middle East/ Iraq: British S.A.S. Scud Hunter. For Afghanistan: Russian Spetznatz Infantryman, Russian Spetznatz Sniper. For Law Enforcement: Police Sniper, Police Helicopter Pilot, Police K-nine officer and German Shepard.\nThe original SAM action figures released featured the same basic movable joint design as the G.I. Joe Classic Collection action figures featuring 15 movable parts. They were slightly taller with a slimmer build, and made with flexible plastic. The hands were a main concern, because they were stiff and difficult to place accessories into, as well as having an unrealistic head sculpt with a baby-face-like design. \nIn 1999, the company released the Super Soldier body design with 27 movable parts. The expanded line included three new categories: The original Ultimate Soldier line included a Vietnam Veterans Memorial set of The Three Soldiers, a Spetsnaz soldier and sniper, a Navy SEAL, George S. Patton, Erwin Rommel and various other modern day soldiers. The America's Finest line included Steve McQueen, firefighters, and a K-9 police officer. \n\nThe Villains line included Boris; a KGB enforcer agent, a bounty Hunter named T-Gore, and a biker. The Misfits line included Jerry Only and Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein from the band the Misfits. A United States Secret Service agent was being considered when it was mentioned in a fan club] news letter; unfortunately this led to an unknown rival toy company producing it before 21st Century toys made their final decision about releasing it. This basic design was used in 2000 to create the Cy Girls known as the Perfect Body Female .\n\nThe arms had four parts, featuring forearms, elbow pieces, lower biceps joints, and upper biceps/shoulder joints. The legs also had four parts with movable hips, calves, thighs and knee caps. The torso consisted of a movable chestpiece, abdomen and a pelvic piece connected by screws and springs. The head consisted of a pivoting neck joint (also connected by a spring and screw) with a universal socket joint for the rubber molded head to connect to. The new head sculpt was much more realistic. The double-jointed elbows and knees enabled the arms and legs to be posed into folded positions. \n\nThis action figure could be posed into the lotus position and any other position that the human body was capable of (and several it was not capable of). The two main concerns were the following: the flap sections on the calves and thigh connecting to the knee caps would have gaps in between them, and the connecting joints created a loose fit. The pivot joint connecting the neck to the torso was also very loose fitting, so that if it were accidentally knocked out of place or removed, there was no known way to put it back on. The accessories, web gear, helmets backpacks,weapons,were created in great detail, and the clothing, headgear, and accoutrements were accurately researched: camouflage patterns and fatigue colors were faithfully created. One of the recurring problem issues had to do with the strapping that was meant to imitate sturdy leather or canvas load straps were represented by ribbon material was of course too subject to breakage at scale.There were also complaints about the Nazi soldiers from the Third Reich being on the shelves. In 2002 the \"12\" inch line was cancelled as companies such as Dragon Models, Blue Box (BBI), Sideshow Collectibles, In the Past Toys and various other rival companies released their products with the same basic body design and their more detailed accessories. 21st Century Toys has moved on to producing smaller palm-sized planes, tanks and action figures.\n\nIn 2014 the Ultimate Soldier XD brand has been reintroduced. The new products are toy building sets of military aircraft. You can see them at ultimatesoldierxd.com\n"}

Such a lord would not be given a trial, but would instead be stripped of his land or exiled. The king could now legally confiscate a fief if a vassal refused to pay homage to him; this had been done in the past but was technically illegal before this \"Assise\". The \"Assise\" was apparently created after a dispute between Gerard, Lord of Sidon, and King Amalric; Gerard had dispossessed one of his rear-vassals and refused to return the land even when Amalric stepped in. Open warfare was just barely avoided.\n\nThe \"Assise\" also made all nobles direct vassals of the king, eliminating the previous distinction between higher and lesser nobles. This distinction still existed in reality, and although they theoretically had an equal voice in the \"Haute Cour\", lesser nobles could only appeal to the high court when their own baronial courts refused to hear their complaints. In any case, the more powerful barons refused to be tried by lesser lords who were not their peers, and the higher nobles were still able to judge the less powerful lords themselves. There were about 600 men eligible to vote in the Court according to the \"Assise\".\n\n\n"}

It is in the Apokoronas municipality of Chania regional unit close to the border with Rethymno regional unit, 47 km from the town of Chania. Kournas is a fairly large village perched on a hill overlooking the lake. \nCrete's only freshwater lake, Lake Kournas, is relatively large, with a perimeter of 3.5 km. Although almost all touristic leaflets say that it is possible to walk around the lake, that is not true. At least not at the end of the rain season (winter). There is a nature preserve on the Southwest of the lake. But there is a rustic road from the North of the lake to the Hills on the West of the lake too.\n\nThe lake used to be called \"Koresia\" after ancient Korion, a city thought to be in the area with a temple to Athena. The lake reportedly used to be full of eels but now is better known for its terrapins and tourism. Tavernas and pedalo rental shops line part of the shore. Overall, however, the lake retains its beauty, the White Mountains reflected in the mirror-like waters. The width, at the point where the landing stage is built, is about 800 m and the water is of a quality to have caused no ill effects to the writer when he swam across.\n\nIf you stand, barefoot, in the water on the sandy beach, tiny fish will (painlessly) nibble dead skin from your feet for free! This is a treatment, which several tourist shops currently (2012) offer at a price.\n\nThere are two roads that lead to Lake Kournas. As you drive up from the main local road Eparchiaki Odos Georgioupolis-Kournas you will come across road signs posted Lake Kournas Exit 1 and Lake Kournas Exit 2. On Lake Kournas Exit 1 you will come through an area of ten houses and cottages known as Dimitrouliana Metochi(small village) \"Geolocation: Latitude: 35.33659 | Longitude: 24.2783232,19\". A unique feature of Dimitrouliana is a group of stone cottages that were built during the Ottoman rule, during the 1700s and possessing Venetian Architecture. Such houses, can be found in many locations in Crete and have central arches made of thick carved stones and wooden lofts to the left and right sides of the arc. One such cottage with a large central arc is Villa Christiana at the Dimitrouliana Metochi. Lake Kourna's popularity due to its ecosystem, has always been a tourist attraction and many owners have renovated their cottages and homes during the first decade of the second millennium giving an aesthetic look to the area, while preserving the architecture of the structures. The road off the Metochi leads to the lake within 200 meters. As it continues curving along a stretch of the lake, it will come across several isolated restaurants until it reaches to Exit 2 of Lake Kournas. There you can find a more organized structure of taverns and restaurants overlooking the lake. During the tourist season there are pedalos, canoes and sunbed for enjoyment. Leaving the Lake area up the road of Lake Kournas, Exit 2 it leads to the main Eparchiaki Odos of Georgioupolis-Kournas.\n"}

It serves the MBTA's Orange Line and is located in the southern part of the Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Green Street is the least-used station on the Orange Line, averaging 3,618 weekday boardings in 2013. Like all Orange Line stations, it is fully wheelchair accessible.\n\nIn 1841, the Boston and Providence Railroad (built starting in 1832) began offering service to Jamaica Plain station, located on the site of today's Green Street station; commuter rail service to the station would continue, uninterrupted, for nearly a century. Originally, the station was at ground level, but, starting in 1891, the Old Colony Railroad (which had acquired the B&P in 1888, and was itself acquired in 1893 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad) raised the section of its main line through Jamaica Plain (extending from Massachusetts Avenue to the current location of Forest Hills station) onto a 4-track stone embankment to eliminate dangerous grade crossings. The project involved the building of five new stations in Roxbury and Jamaica Plain; the existing stations at Roxbury Crossing, Jamaica Plain, and Forest Hills were replaced with new elevated stations, while new stations were built at Heath Street and Boylston Street. The brand-new Jamaica Plain station opened on June 1, 1897, along with the other four new stations.\n\nOn 22 November 1909, the Washington Street Elevated was extended south along Washington Street from its original southern terminus at Dudley, with new stations at Egleston and Forest Hills. Both Egleston and Forest Hills allowed direct connections to the Elevated from streetcar routes serving Roxbury, Dorchester, and Jamaica Plain (as well as, in the case of Forest Hills, to NYNH&H commuter trains); however, El ridership from the areas immediately surrounding the extension also proved high, and an infill station at Green Street (three blocks to the east of the NYNH&H station) opened on 22 September 1912.\n\nAlthough the five NYNH&H stations in Jamaica Plain continued to operate for over three decades following the southward extension of the Washington Street Elevated, they were ultimately unable to compete with the Elevated, and all, including Jamaica Plain station, were closed on 29 September 1940 due to a lack of passengers.\n\nIn the 1960s, plans took hold to extend I-95 into downtown Boston along the NYNH&H's right-of-way and to replace the Washington Street Elevated (from 1967 known as the Orange Line) with a rapid transit line running in the new highway's median; these plans led to the demolition of hundreds of homes and the clearing of a long strip of land (the Southwest Corridor) extending through Roxbury and Jamaica Plain all the way up to Green Street, before the project was halted by highway revolts in 1969 and the 11 February 1970 announcement by Governor Francis W. Sargent of a moratorium on new highway construction within the Route 128 corridor, and eventually cancelled by Governor Sargent in 1972. The cleared strip of land was eventually developed into the Southwest Corridor Park, and the Orange Line was moved to a new alignment along the Corridor in 1987 despite the cancellation of the project originally calling for its relocation. This included a new rapid transit station at Green Street, on the site of the former NYNH&H station; the old Green Street station, along with the rest of the Washington Street Elevated, was permanently closed on 30 April 1987, and the new station opened on 4 May, as did the eight other new stations on the southern Orange Line.\n\nGreen Street station primarily serves surrounding residential neighborhoods, as well Jamaica Plain's primary business district on Centre Street to the west. The station also provides access to many parks located in Jamaica Plain. Franklin Park is east of the station, and to its west is Jamaica Pond, part of Boston's Emerald Necklace of parks. The station is also located along the linear Southwest Corridor Park which tracks the Southwest Corridor.\n\nGreen Street was not built as a bus transfer station, and lacks an off-street busway. Since route 48 was discontinued on July 1, 2012, Green Street and nearby have no direct bus connections. , the next stop to the south, is a major bus transfer station.\n\nLike many of the Orange Line stations built in the Southwest Corridor, Green Street has street-level retail space. Since the late 1990s, a succession of related art galleries has been located inside the station.\n\nA local artist, James Hull, noted that the space was empty in 1996. He reached an agreement with the MBTA's leasing agent under which he paid no rent, and \"The Gallery @ Green Street\" opened in 1998. Staffed by volunteers, the gallery displayed contemporary works by a range of artists, including local students and non-commercial pieces by experienced artists. Hull later agreed to install air conditioning and a bathroom in return for use of the space. \n\nIn December 2006, the space became the home of a successor gallery, the \"Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media\", which was operated by a non-profit artist collective, and featured rotating shows of artworks incorporating modern technology. In July 2012, Axiom closed the gallery, and the space became the \"Boston Cyberarts Gallery\", operated by an associated group.\n\n"}

He is the founder and executive board chairman of MediaNews Group, the fourth-largest newspaper company in the United States in terms of circulation, with 53 daily papers totaling 2.7 million subscriptions daily and 3 million on Sunday. He is also a former chairman of the board of directors of the Associated Press. Additionally, he has been publisher of a number of MediaNews' dailies, including the \"Denver Post\", the \"Salt Lake Tribune\" and the \"Detroit News\". He is a cattle rancher, owning several ranches.\n\nSingleton was born in Graham, Texas. He began his newspaper career at the age of 15 as a part-time reporter in Graham and bought his first newspaper at age 21.\n\nSingleton has built his newspaper company through the acquisition of newspapers. He closed several of those newspapers, such as the \"Fort Worth Press\" and the \"Houston Post\". He also bought the \"Denver Post\" and the \"Oakland Tribune\" where he laid off staff, he said, to increase efficiency. In the latest round of cuts, the daily \"Oakland Tribune\" will become a weekly.\n\nSingleton was a pioneer in \"clustering\"—developing groups of newspapers that centralized a variety of functions, including production, ad sales, business operations and, in some cases, editorial. An example of this was the Alameda Newspaper Group in suburban San Francisco, where in the mid-1990s, a central newsroom in Pleasanton, California, did all the copy editing, layout and page makeup for five daily papers. Upon acquiring the diverse group of papers, Singleton consolidated several news sections (such as sports and features) to one local office away in order to streamline work.\n\nHe was also a pioneer, at developing pooled-asset partnerships. Among the first were papers in California, which included papers from Gannett Co. Inc., Stephens Media Group and MediaNews. Singleton's company contributed \"Los Angeles Daily News\" and the ANG operation, as well as other papers, while Stephens contributed papers such as the \"Vallejo Times Herald\" and the \"Inland Valley Daily Bulletin\" of Ontario. A year after forming the partnership, the duo allowed Gannett to enter, with its contributions including the \"San Bernardino Sun\" and the \"Marin Independent Journal\". The partnership is known as the \"California Newspapers Partnership\". MediaNews has entered into similar partnerships in Texas and Pennsylvania with Gannett and in Colorado with The E.W. Scripps Company.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Singleton began focusing less on consolidating news rooms and put more focus on the quality of news rooms.

{"id": "2215683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215683", "title": "FirstEnergy", "text": "FirstEnergy\n\nFirstEnergy Corp is an electric utility headquartered in Akron, Ohio. Its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the distribution, transmission, and generation of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy-related services. Its ten electric utility operating companies comprise one of the United States' largest investor-owned utilities, based on serving 6 million customers within a area of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Its generation subsidiaries control more than 16,000 megawatts of capacity, and its distribution lines span over 194,000 miles. In 2018, FirstEnergy ranked 219 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest public corporations in the United States by revenue.\n\nIn November 2016, FirstEnergy made the decision to exit the competitive power business, and become a fully regulated company.\n\nFirstEnergy was formed on November 7, 1997, when Ohio Edison acquired Centerior Energy and its subsidiaries for $1.6 billion in stock. The company was acquired with plans for a restructuring and layoffs to cut costs. That same month the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) initiated an investigation into the reliability of FirstEnergy's energy transmission in the context of possible plant shutdowns and prior problems with Centerior.\n\nIn 2001, FirstEnergy merged with GPU, Inc., the owner of Jersey Central Power & Light Company, Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec), and Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed).\n\nFirstEnergy would later merge with Greensburg, Pennsylvania-based Allegheny Energy in 2011.\n\nOn March 31, 2018, FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy. FirstEnergy Solutions was a generation subsidiary, and FirstEnergy itself remains solvent. The case is being closely watched as it could have significant implications for the U.S. power sector, as the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio has asserted its primacy over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relating to certain FirstEnergy Solutions FERC-regulated power purchase agreements.\n\nThe Company filed its eighth amended bankruptcy plan on October 14, 2019. In 2020, it emerged from bankruptcy, becoming Energy Harbor Corp.\n\nIn March, 2018, FirstEnergy announced it is closing the Perry Nuclear Generating Station and Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station, both in Ohio, and Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station in Pennsylvania. This was followed in August 2018 with the announcement of the closure of two coal-fired plants, the W.H. Sammis Power Plant in Stratton, Ohio and the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania by June 2022.\n\nHowever, the closure of the Perry, Davis–Besse and Sammis plants were rescinded in July 2019 when the State of Ohio passed and signed into law a subsidy to support the Perry and Davis–Besse nuclear plants.\n\nFirstEnergy has worked to put more electric vehicles on the road. To accomplish this, the company partnered with Nissan and BMW to offer customers rebates who purchase electric vehicles from those two companies. The 2018 Nissan LEAF and BMW i3 models are eligible. LEAF buyers get a $3,000 rebate while i3 buyers get $10,000.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the company stopped power shutoffs and restored connections for those whose power had been terminated because of non-payment. They also requested that customers who were facing hardship paying their utility bills contact the company to set up alternate payment programs, energy assistance programs or other energy arrangements, based on the customer’s ability to pay. This included customers of all ten First Energy utility companies in six states.\n\nAs of 4/1/2020 FirstEnergy Corp or any of its subsidiaries has not offered to waive late fees or penalties for any of their customers.\n\nOhio Edison Company (formerly OEC on the NYSE) was a publicly traded holding company that began in 1930, from the consolidation of 200 electric companies. By 1950, it ended up with two utility operating companies, Pennsylvania Power and Ohio Edison. It continued in existence until 1997, when its merger with Centerior formed FirstEnergy:\n\nCenterior Energy Corporation (formerly CX on the NYSE) was formed in 1986 from the merger of two old operating companies. Centerior was based in Independence, Ohio, and existed as a publicly traded holding company for ten years, until its merger with Ohio Edison formed FirstEnergy in 1997:\n\n\nGeneral Public Utilities (formerly GPU on the NYSE) was a publicly traded utility holding company in Morristown, New Jersey. In 1996, the company was reorganized and renamed GPU, Inc. In 1996, it formed a new division as well, GPU Energy, which became the holding company for its three utility operating companies:\n\n\nIn 2001, FirstEnergy Corporation, with its four utility operating companies, merged with GPU, Inc., bringing GPU's three additional operating companies into FirstEnergy as well.\n\nThrough the 2001 acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy also acquired:\n\nGPU is best known as the former owner of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. In 1989, Standley H. Hoch, a former executive with General Dynamics, became the CEO of GPU. Hoch had two main goals—cut costs and fight to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which made it difficult for utilities to operate across state lines.\n\nAllegheny Energy was an electric utility serving customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. Its regulated subsidiaries are West Penn Power (serving Southwestern and Central Pennsylvania), Monongahela Power (a.k.a. \"Mon Power\", serving Northern and Southern West Virginia), and The Potomac Edison Company (western Maryland, parts of eastern West Virginia, and northern Virginia). The electric generating plants are operated by subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company and Monongahela Power.\n\nBefore the formation of Allegheny Energy, the holding company was known as Allegheny Power System which had the three utility operating units. The brand name Allegheny Power was used on customer bills, trucks and company equipment starting in 1996. In 1997, the company attempted to merge with Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Light Company. The merger was withdrawn by both parties and both companies did not merge. In 1999, Allegheny Power purchased the West Virginia operations of UtiliCorp United's West Virginia Power. UtiliCorp purchased Virginia Electric and Power Company's (present day Dominion Resources) West Virginia service area in 1986 and renamed the acquired service area West Virginia Power.\n\nIn February 2010, Allegheny Energy announced plans to merge with FirstEnergy. The merger was approved by stockholders of both companies, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and regulatory commissions in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The merger was finalized when the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission approved the merger on February 24, 2011; the merger closed on February 25, 2011. The merger does not include Allegheny's service area in Virginia, which was purchased in 2010 by the Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative and the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative.\n\nAfter the merger with Allegheny Energy, FirstEnergy was the largest investor-owned electric utility in the country for a short period of time based on customers served before the Exelon/Constellation and Duke Energy/Progress Energy mergers.\n\nFirstEnergy announced its intent in November 2016 to exit the competitive businesses while staying in the regulated businesses and become a fully regulated company during the next 18 months. FirstEnergy Solutions, the company's competitive subsidiary, manages 13,000 MW of generating capacity and is a leading energy supplier serving residential, commercial and industrial customers in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. It was anticipated that some generating units would be sold, and some would be shut down. Robert E. Murray, CEO of Murray Energy, warned in August 2017 that FirstEnergy Solutions was in danger of bankruptcy if an emergency order to open coal-fired plants was not issued by the White House. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) unanimously rejected a United States Department of Energy (DOE) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to subsidize coal and nuclear plants in January 2018. FirstEnergy Solutions filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 31, 2018. As a result of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions sought federal intervention of invoking Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to keep their power plants operating.\n\nIn February 2018, FirstEnergy announced plans to deactivate or sell Pleasants Power Station in West Virginia. In March 2018, FirstEnergy announced plans to deactivate or sell the Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse, and Perry nuclear power plants, which are in the Ohio and Pennsylvania deregulated electricity market, during the next three years.\n\nFirstEnergy's electric generation is primarily from coal and nuclear power plants, but also includes natural gas, oil, and hydroelectric power plants.\n\nA 2017 report conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst placed FirstEnergy 9 out of the top 100 of the country's largest greenhouse polluters.\n\nFirstEnergy was required to pay $1.5 billion by 2011 as part of a settlement to end a lawsuit filed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. This lawsuit alleged that the company failed to install pollution control equipment when upgrading its coal burning plants. Also as part of the settlement, major pollution control equipment is now being installed at the FirstEnergy Sammis site and others. This lawsuit was one of the New Source Review lawsuits filed in the 1990s.\n\nTo provide cleaner energy to its customers, FirstEnergy took several important steps in 2009. First, the company announced plans in April to repower Units 4 and 5 at its R.E. Burger Power Station in Shadyside, Ohio, to generate electricity principally with biomass, the only base load renewable source that can displace coal emissions. Furthermore, FirstEnergy hosted a 1 MW pilot plant test of carbon capture retrofit equipment for carbon sequestration on one of the remaining coal units at the R.E. Burger. In September, FirstEnergy decided to complete construction on the Fremont Energy Center, a 707-MW natural-gas-fired peaking plant by the end of 2010. And finally in November, FirstEnergy purchased the rights to develop a compressed-air electric generating plant in Norton, Ohio, which Ohio Governor Ted Strickland praised as \"an example of how we can leverage technology and our natural resources to grow our economy and ensure our energy future.\" The Norton project, part of the company's overall climate change strategy, has the potential to be expanded to up to 2,700 MW of capacity—the largest in the world by far. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, \"a compressed-air energy storage project of this size...could be a key component in integrating large-scale intermittent renewables (such as wind) onto the nation's grid system.\" Together, these projects, when completed, will further reduce the utility's emissions of , which already is about one-third below the regional average.\n\nFirstEnergy Solutions Corp. has also given renewable energy certificates to help balance out the amount of electricity used in Earth Day events that were held at nine post-secondary education locations in Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Each of the schools received five SmartWind REC's, enough energy to light a large building for the entire day.\n\nEnergy efficiency became a state mandate in 2008 when lawmakers agreed with former Gov. Ted Strickland after months of debate to pass a law requiring electric utilities to help customers use less electricity every year—22 percent less by 2025 than they did in 2009. Under the 2008 law, FirstEnergy slaps companies that do not invest in energy efficiency with higher rates. But industries that use their waste heat to make power could escape that rate increase.\n\nAs of November 29, 2012 FirstEnergy Corp. has abandoned its behind-the-scene lobbying campaign to persuade lawmakers to gut a four-year-old law requiring utilities to help customers use less electricity by switching to energy efficient equipment and lighting.\n\nSeveral cases have been brought against FirstEnergy for its dumping of coal waste into Little Blue Run Lake in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. FirstEnergy has dumped more than 20 billion gallons of coal ash and smokestack scrubber waste into the body of water which has contaminated local water supplies with arsenic, sulfates, sodium, calcium, magnesium and chloride.\n\nA July 2012 consent decree from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection is forcing FirstEnergy to close the Little Blue Run Lake, an unlined waste impoundment in Beaver County, Pennsylvania and Hancock County, West Virginia. Coal ash waste slurry has been piped there from FirstEnergy's Bruce Mansfield Power Plant since 1974. The reservoir at Little Blue Run is the country's largest coal ash impoundment. Pollutants including sulfates, chlorides, and arsenic have been found in groundwater nearby. FirstEnergy must stop dumping coal ash at the site by 2016, pay a penalty of $800,000, provide clean water to local residents, and do environmental monitoring of seeps for toxic pollutants including selenium, boron, and arsenic.\n\nCharles E. Jones has been president and chief executive officer of FirstEnergy since 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

The only series-built variant was Amiot 122 BP3 medium bomber, other known variant was Amiot 123 long-distance record plane.\n\nThe aircraft was designed as a medium single-engine biplane bomber with metal construction and conventional in layout, with braced wings. The fuselage consisted of a frame of duralumin pipes while the engine was covered with duralumin sheets, with the rest of the aircraft covered in fabric. A fixed conventional landing gear, with a rear skid was fitted. A crew of three sat in tandem in open cockpits.\n\nThe first of the series was Amiot 120 BN2, a 2-seater bomber prototype, powered with a Renault 12Ma 580 hp inline engine (registration F-AHCR). It was not ordered by the French Air Force and only one example was built. More successful was the next slightly enlarged variant, the Amiot 122, of 1927, powered by a Lorraine 18 Kd, 650 hp engine. Its initial production variant was Amiot 122 BP2 2-seater bomber (registration F-AIUQ), but it entered production as the Amiot 122 BP3 3-seater bomber. A total of 80 aircraft were built for the French Air Force and five for Brazil.\n\nAnother variant was the Amiot 123. Designed as a bomber, designated the Amiot 123 BP3 (one was built) but the French Air Force showed no interest in it. At that time, Polish authorities were looking for a long-distance record aircraft for transatlantic flights. In 1928 and 1929, two modified Amiot 123 aircraft were built as a long-distance variant, with enlarged fuel tanks (first had Lorraine 18 Kdrs 710 hp engine, the second Lorraine 18 Kdrs 785 hp engine).\n\nThe last two variants, the Amiot 124 BP3 and Amiot 125 BP3 were bomber prototypes in 1931, fitted with Hispano-Suiza 18Sbr 1000 hp and Renault 18Jbr 700 hp engines respectively, but not ordered by the French Air Force. Some sources claim, that Amiot 121 with a Lorraine 18 Kd 650 hp engine and Amiot 126 prototypes with a Lorraine 18 Gad 700 hp engine were also built.\n\nThe Amiot 122 was first used as a long-distance sports aircraft. From 13 September 1927, the prototype carried out a 10,800 km tour around the Mediterranean Sea, from Paris, through Vienna, Beirut, Cairo, Benghazi, Tunis, Casablanca to Paris. From 3–5 April 1928, Lieutenant Girardot flew it across the Sahara, on the Paris-Timbuktu-Dakar-Paris 10,100 km route.\n\nA total of 80 Amiot 122 BP3s were used by the French Air Force as reconnaissance bombers, starting in 1930. They were used in the 11th Aviation Regiment, based in Metz. They were nicknamed by pilots \"La Grosse Julie\" (Big Julie).\n\nIn 1931, Brazil ordered five aircraft (four, according to Brazilian publications). They were used until 1936. One aircraft was used on the government side during a coup d'etat in July 1932.\n\nPaul Teste was killed in an Amiot 120 on the 13 June 1925 as he was training for a transatlantic flight.\n\nThe first Amiot 123 was bought by the Polish Air Force in order for a first westbound transatlantic flight (in some sources, it is designated as Amiot 123.01). It was named \"Marszałek Piłsudski\" (Marshal Józef Piłsudski). The crew were pilot Ludwik Idzikowski and navigator Kazimierz Kubala. They commenced their first trial of a transatlantic flight on 3 August 1928, taking off at 4:45 a.m. from Paris Le Bourget airfield. However, after flying some 3200 km away, above the ocean, they noticed a lowering oil level in the engine, which was caused by a cracked oil tank. They decided to return to Europe, since it was more than a half way to America, against the wind. After 31 hours of flight, when the oil in engine had depleted, Idzikowski decided to land on water, by the German merchant ship \"Samos\", about 70 km away from the Spanish coast. The sailors rescued the crew and pulled the aircraft out of the water, but it was damaged.\n\nIdzikowski and Kubala repeated this trial the next year. The second Amiot 123 was bought, initially built for the French pilot (according to some sources, it was still the first aircraft). It was named \"Orzeł Biały\" (the \"White Eagle\", although according to some sources, it was still \"Marszałek Piłsudski\"). They took off on 13 July 1929, at 3:45 a.m. from Le Bourget. After flying 2140 km, over the ocean, about 5 p.m., the engine started to lose power, becoming noisy. They decided to land on Faial Island of the Azores. However, because of more irregular engine work, at 9 p.m. (7 p.m. local time), Idzikowski decided to make an emergency landing on a closer rocky island Graciosa. During the landing on a field, the aircraft hit a low stone wall and overturned wheels up. In the crash, Ludwik Idzikowski was killed, while Kazimierz Kubala was lightly injured. During a rescue action, the aircraft burned.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2215723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215723", "title": "Pukkelpop", "text": "Pukkelpop\n\nPukkelpop is an annual music festival that takes place near the city of Hasselt, Belgium, in mid-to-late August. It is held within a large enclosure of fields and woodland—between a dual carriageway called \"Kempische Steenweg\"—in the village of Kiewit, approximately 7 km north of Hasselt. It is the second largest music festival in Belgium after Rock Werchter, with an attendance rate of 180,000 over the course of the event in 2009.\n\nThe program is noted for its wide variety of alternative music, spanning styles such as rock, pop, electronic, dance, hip-hop, punk and heavy metal. The event's organizers aim the festival to be a \"progressive and contemporary\" musical event. Notable acts that have performed at previous editions include Sonic Youth, Ramones, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, Radiohead, Metallica, PJ Harvey, Green Day, Blink-182, Guns N' Roses, Pixies, Daft Punk, The Prodigy, Nine Inch Nails, Iron Maiden, Björk, The Stone Roses and Eminem. The term \"pukkel\" is the Dutch word for \"pimple\".\n\nThe festival was founded in 1985 by youth organisation Humanistic Youth of Leopoldsburg (, or \"Hujo\"). It originated as a single day event, held on July 21—a national holiday in Belgium—in the village of Leopoldsburg, located approximately 25 km north of the event's current home in Kiewit. The inaugural event in 1985 took place at the village football grounds of Complex Excelsior Heppen and featured seven acts, with English songwriter Anne Clark headlining. The first year was attended by 3,000 people.\n\nIn 1988, the festival moved to the village of Hechtel-Eksel where it was held at Sanicole Airfield. The festival was also moved to late August. In 1989, the festival was cancelled after the two headliners, The Pogues and The Sugarcubes, cancelled their appearances a few weeks before the event. The festival returned in 1990, again taking place in Hechtel-Eksel, and reached a peak of 10,000 attendees. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds headlined.\n\nIn 1991, the festival moved to its current home in Kiewit. In its first year, the event took place on the grounds of the children's petting farm (Dutch: \"Kinderboerderij\") located in the village. Ramones headlined on a bill which included Nirvana, who performed at the festival a month prior to the release of the group's breakthrough album \"Nevermind\". In 1992, the festival site was moved to the fields by the Kempische Steenweg motorway, where it has been held ever since.\n\nIn 1993, a new indoor stage called The Marquee was added, supplementing the outdoor Main Stage and almost doubling the amount of performers over the previous year. A second indoor stage, the Dance Hall, was added in 1994. In 1995, for the festival's tenth anniversary, the event became a two-day event for the first time, with Neil Young and The Smashing Pumpkins as the headlining acts. The festival also reached a peak in attendees at 60,000.\n\nIn 1996, two new stages were added: the outdoor Skate Stage, and a smaller-sized marquee called Club. Another marquee, named the Boiler Room, was added in 1997, bringing the total number of stages to six. From 1998 to 2001, the Skate Stage was renamed to the Hip-hop Stage for one of the two festival days, exclusively focused on rap and hip-hop artists such as Jurassic 5 and The Pharcyde. In 1999, the dance event Creamfields was amalgamated into Pukkelpop on the first day of the event; as a result most of the existing stages exclusively showcased dance music under different names. 1999 also saw the debut of the Experimental Stage, renamed to ChateauXCrapule the following year, and shortened to Chateau from the 2004 edition.\n\nIn 2000, an exchange programme was announced with Oppikoppi, an annual music festival held in South Africa near the city of Pretoria. In the same year, Eminem was forced to cancel his confirmed headline slot at the festival as he was barred from leaving the United States.\n\nIn 2001, the festival became a three-day event for the first time, reaching an attendance peak of 115,000, a 76% increase over the previous year. In 2004, an eighth stage was added, called Wablief? (Dutch word for \"What?\"). In 2005, the festival celebrated its 20th anniversary, featuring headliners Pixies, The Prodigy and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The event also reached another attendance peak, totaling 137,000 festival-goers.\n\nThe festival returned in 2010 for its 25th anniversary, with Iron Maiden, Placebo, Queens of the Stone Age and Snow Patrol among the headlining acts. The 2010 edition was notable as the first ever Pukkelpop to have sold out its entire allotment of tickets, approximately five weeks prior to the commencement of the festival.\n\nDuring the 2010 festival, two musicians died. Michael Been, lead singer and guitarist of The Call, died on August 19 of a heart attack after performing duties as sound engineer for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. On August 20, Ou Est Le Swimming Pool singer Charles Haddon committed suicide by jumping from a telecommunications mast in the backstage parking area, shortly after the group's performance at the festival. Haddon was reported to be upset about an injury sustained by a fan after stage-diving into the crowd.\n\nThe 2011 festival was affected by a severe thunderstorm during the evening of August 18, 2011, the opening day of the event. Torrential rain and strong winds toppled several concert tents, uprooted trees and knocked down festival light towers and video screens. The Chateau tent collapsed shortly after American rock band Smith Westerns began performing their set. Lead singer/guitarist Cullen Omori updated the band's Twitter account directly after the incident: \"Stage collapsed max almost got crushed by trees, I hope pukkelpop has insurance bc all our shit is broke\". The message was later removed. Five people were killed, and at least 140 were injured. The death toll was originally believed to be five, however this figure was later dropped to four; Belgian media have suggested that a man who died in a local hospital and did not attend the festival was erroneously counted as a reported death. Another victim died five days later in the hospital, which brought the death toll back to five. Following the storm, officials of the event announced that all music performances for the remainder of the night would be cancelled and that the festival would be put on hold \"until we understand the situation completely\". On August 19, 2011, the organisers decided to cancel the entire event. A statement read:\nThe closest anemometer, in the town of Diepenbeek, recorded gusts above 80 km/h (50 mph), with reports of large hail and the possibility of a tornado. However, research done by specialists after the event, showed that the actual wind speed at the festival site reached 170 km/h (106 mph).\n\nThe 2011 festival was to have featured Eminem, Foo Fighters, The Offspring, dEUS and Thirty Seconds to Mars among the headlining acts. The incident came just five days after the Indiana State Fair stage collapse in the United States, which killed seven people, and sparked debate about regulations in outdoor concert events.\n\nPukkelpop provides free camping facilities to attendees. The camping site lies on one side of \"Kempische Steenweg\"—with the main event grounds located directly on the other—and is opened on the day prior to the commencement of the event. Traffic guards are implemented in order to direct traffic and attendees during the festival period. To incentivise use of public transport, an outward return trip within Belgium to Hasselt or Kiewit on the NMBS/SNCB train network or on the De Lijn bus network is included with all ticket types. A free shuttle bus, which runs regularly during the festival period, is also provided to-and-from Hasselt train station and the festival site in Kiewit. There are two ticket types available: day tickets, which provide access to one of the three days of the event, and \"combi\" tickets, which provide access to all three days of the festival.\n\nPolsslag (Dutch term for \"pulse (beat)\") was a one-day annual music festival which took place in Hasselt in the spring of 2008 and 2009. The event, billed as Pukkelpop's sister festival, was held indoors at the Grenslandhallen in Hasselt. The festival featured four stages, the names of which are all retained from Pukkelpop: The Marquee, Dance Hall, Club and Boiler Room.\n\nThe first Polsslag event took place in 2008, taking place on April 15 and featuring acts such as The Breeders, Millencolin and Boys Noize. In 2009, the festival ran on May 2, with artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing.\n\n"}

{"id": "2215760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215760", "title": "Baby oil", "text": "Baby oil\n\nBaby oil is, in general terms, an inert oil for the purpose of keeping skin soft and supple. It is often used on babies for the purpose of maintaining \"baby-soft\" skin, but it is also often used by adults.\n\nThe skin of an infant, especially a premature one, is sensitive, thin and fragile. Its neutral pH on the surface significantly reduces the protection against excessive bacterial growth. The epidermis and dermis are thinner than those of adults and the epidermal barrier is not yet fully developed. Consequences can for example be dry skin, infections, peeling, blister formation and poor thermoregulation. The application of different oils to the skin of the newborn is routinely practiced in many countries. In general, these oils are used for cleansing, to maintain the skin's moisture and to protect its surface. Additionally, baby oil is used for the massage of newborns and as additive in lotions and creams.\n\nBaby oils can be classified by the base formulation of the product. They are based on \n\nTypical components of baby oils are the highly purified mineral oil products such as liquid paraffin (INCI name: paraffinum liquidum) and vaseline (INCI name: petrolatum). These compounds are odorless and tasteless, dermatologically tested and approved, not allergenic, hydrophobic and contain no pesticides or herbicides. Preservatives or antioxidants are not necessary, because in contrast to vegetable oils, there is no risk of rancidity with paraffins. Nevertheless, the use of mineral oil in cosmetics is being criticized. Natural cosmetic companies claim that the use of mineral oil results in skin occlusion. Conventional cosmetic manufacturers and even dermatologists and cosmetic chemists argue against that and studies were not able to show any statistical difference between paraffin oil and vegetable oils in terms of skin penetration and skin occlusion. On the contrary, petrolatum-based preparations have been shown to be effective to the skin barrier function, even in premature infants. \n\nVegetable oils are produced by plants with the highest concentration being present in seeds and fruits. About 95% of each vegetable oil is primarily composed of triglycerides. Coconut oil and palm oil contain mainly saturated fatty acids, while other oils largely contain unsaturated fatty acids, for example oleic acid and linoleic acid. Accompanying substances in vegetable oils are, inter alia, phospholipids, glycolipids, sulfolipids, squalene, carotenoids, vitamin E, polyphenols and triterpene alcohols. To avoid rancidity, preservatives or antioxidants are added to baby oils based on vegetable oils. On cosmetic products, these oils are listed according to the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), e.g.:\n\n\nVegetable oils are not to be confused with essential oils, both being sourced from plants.\n\nBaby oils are largely used as skin care products and their principle use remains as skin moisturizers. In particular, baby oils find application in the treatment of various skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, xerosis, psoriasis and other eczematous conditions. Another area of use is the oil massage of the newborn which has been a tradition in India and other Asian countries since time immemorial. The massage itself has benefits including the stimulation of circulatory and gastrointestinal systems, better weight gain, lesser stress behaviour, positive effects on neurological and neuromotor development and infant-parent bonding. Massage with oil results in improved skin condition, namely increased hydration and surface lipid content. The barrier function and thermoregulation are improved and the loss of transepidermal water is reduced.\n"}

Population: 18,000 (1970).\n\nKashin was first mentioned in a chronicle under the year of 1238, when it was sacked during the Mongol invasion. It was given by Grand Duke Mikhail Yaroslavich as an appanage to his son Vasily, who founded a short-lived dynasty of local princes. Mikhail Yaroslavich's wife Anna took the veil in Kashin's nunnery, died there on October 2, 1368, and was glorified by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1650 as a holy patroness of all women who suffer the loss of relatives. Her relics are preserved in the Ascension Cathedral of Kashin.\n\nIn 1382, Kashin was annexed by Principality of Tver. From 1399 to 1426, it was held by a second dynasty of Kashin princes, who claimed their seniority in the House of Tver. In 1452, Kashin withstood a siege by Dmitry Shemyaka. It finally passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1486 with the rest of the Principality of Tver.\nIn 1708, the town became a part of Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate), but in 1727 it was transferred to Moscow Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Kashinsky Uyezd with the seat in Kashin was established. In 1796, Tver Viceroyalty was transformed into Tver Governorate. On October 3, 1927, Kashinsky Uyezd was abolished and split between Bezhetsky and Kimrsky Uyezds. On July 12, 1929, Kashinsky District, with the administrative center in the Kashin, was established within Bezhetsk Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, Kalinin Oblast was established and Kashin was transferred to it. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Kashin serves as the administrative center of Kashinsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kashinsky District as Kashin Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Kashinsky Municipal District.\n\nThe mean temperature in Kashin is in January and in July.\n\nThe town is an important part of the oblast's economy. It is home to \"Veresk\", one of the largest alcoholic drink producing companies in the region. Another major business is the mineral water company \"ERA\", which produces the Kashinskaya brand of mineral water. There are also an electric equipment company, a wool factory, and a milk and meat-processing company.\n\nSeveral times a week, a market is organized in the main square of the town where residents can sell various items. Also, fruit and vegetables from nearby rural farms are sold.\n\nBuses provide public transportation within the town and commute to nearby destinations. Also, a train passes through Kashin twice a day. The morning train travels from Sonkovo to Savyolovo, while the afternoon train travels in the opposite direction. Several times a week, a train from St. Petersburg stops in Kashin.\n\nThere are several architectural monuments in Kashin, including monasteries, churches, and cathedrals. The most ancient of these, a wooden chapel from 1646, was burned to the ground in 1998.\n\nThe town contains thirty-six cultural heritage monuments of federal significance, including the ensemble of the Presentation Monastery and a number of churches built in the 18th and the 19th centuries.\nThe Museum of Local Lore is located in Kashin. Also, in the village of Verkhnyaya Troitsa, situated from Kashin, the house of Mikhail Kalinin, a Soviet statesman, is located.\n\nThere is a resort area near Kashin where many oblast residents spend their vacation near the Kashinka River. Kashin itself is known as a balneological resort. On holidays and special dates, the town hosts large festivals which involve dancing, food, and various performances.\n\n\n"}

K.\" Williams (November 4, 1936 – September 20, 2015) was an American poet, critic and translator. Williams won nearly every major poetry award. \"Flesh and Blood\" won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1987. \"Repair\" (1999) won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, was a National Book Award finalist and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. \"The Singing\" won the National Book Award, 2003 and in 2005 Williams received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. The 2012 film \"Tar\" related aspects of Williams' life using his poetry.\n\nThe American poet C.K. Williams was born in Newark, New Jersey, on November 4, 1936. His parents were Paul B. Williams and Dossie Kasdin. His grandparents came to the USA from Kiev, then a Russian city, and Lvov, Ukraine.\n\nHe went to Columbia High School in Maplewood, attended Bucknell University for one year, then moved on to and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe started writing poetry during his second year at Penn, and half-way through junior year he left for Paris. At that time he wrote “I fell into a period of lacerating loneliness. I’d always been a little shy but now something, maybe my uncertainty about my identity as a poet, my sense of being a pretender, made me all but mute with strangers : I used to stay all day in my hotel room, reading, trying to write, then I’d go out to eat by myself, and take endless, anguished walks.” When he returned to Penn, he switched major from philosophy to English. He studied poetry with Morse Peckham, who also mentioned that T.S. Eliot had written that if you wanted to be a poet, you had to write poetry every day, a recommendation Williams applied in his writing life.\n\nAfter graduating from Penn, he stayed in Philadelphia. His circle of friends included artists, carpenters, poets, a famous sociologist, photographers, musicians and film makers. He spent time with young architects who worked for Louis Kahn, and later wrote: “I realized that my image of the artist’s calling had come almost entirely from Kahn: he was absolutely devoted to his craft, and expected the same dedication from everyone else.” He published his first book, Lies, in 1969.\n\nIn 1963 he married Sarah Dean Jones, a printer who worked for Eugene Feldman at the Falcon Press in Philadelphia. The marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter, Jessie Williams Burns, founded Tursulowe Press in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1973 he met Catherine Mauger. They married in 1975 and had a son, Jed Williams, a painter and the owner of an art gallery in Philadelphia. His paintings are often featured on the covers of Williams’ books. Catherine and C.K. lived part of the year in the USA, and part of the year in Paris, France, and later in Normandy.\n\nWilliams began teaching in the mid 70’s at the YM-YMHA in Philadelphia. He also worked as an assistant group therapist. He taught creative writing at different universities, among them, Franklin and Marshall, the University of California at Irvine, Boston University, Brooklyn College, Columbia University, George Mason University and, starting in 1996, Princeton University. He traveled across the country, and out of the country, giving readings and poetry workshops. He also worked on translations, notably of two Greek tragedies.\n\nAfter publishing his second book, \"I Am the Bitter Name\", Williams said that he had felt like giving up writing. Then he was asked to read at a college of art in Philadelphia, and he decided to read some unfinished poems: “ and I was astonished to realize that they were exactly what I’d been waiting for, though I hadn’t known I’d been waiting for anything at all. The poems were long, ragged lines, they had a much more conversational tone than the poems I’d been writing. Most importantly, the new poems, while having a much more narrative structure than the older ones, also had much more direct mechanisms for tracing thoughts, perceptions and emotions ; they gave me a way to deal more inclusively and exhaustively with my own mind than the poems I’d been writing until then. I began to write poetry again, with more conviction than ever, and more confidence, more of a sense of what I wanted to do (…) The scope of the poems, the certainty they gave me that I could deal thoroughly with themes that interested me, were enough to keep me going. They are the poems that were collected in \"With Ignorance\" and \"Tar\".” \n\nC.K. Williams became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2003. He had a wide circle of friends in the U.S. and in Europe, many of them artists and writers. He gave a last reading and interview at Drew University in June 2015. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the summer of 2013. He died at home in Hopewell, New Jersey on September 20, 2015. Twenty days earlier, he had finished working on the manuscript of his last book of poems, \"Falling Ill\".\n\nHis first book, \"Lies\"', was published in 1969, and he published many collections of poetry. His \"Collected Poems\" appeared in 2006, of which Peter Campion wrote in The Boston Globe: “Throughout the five decades represented in his new \"Collected Poems\", Williams has maintained the most sincere, and largest, ambitions. Like Yeats and Lowell before him, he writes from the borderland between private and public life…(His poems) join skeptical intelligence and emotional sincerity, to make sense of the world and ourselves. C.K. Williams has set a new standard for American poetry.\"\n\nHis book \"Repair\" won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000, and in 2003 \"The Singing\" won the National Book Award. He also wrote essays, plays, children books and worked on translations. His last book of poetry, \"Falling Ill\", was published in 2017, after his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2215797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215797", "title": "Kart dynasty", "text": "Kart dynasty\n\nThe Kart dynasty, also known as the Kartids, was a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Tajik origin, that ruled over a large part of Khorasan during the 13th and 14th centuries. Ruling from their capital at Herat and central Khorasan in the Bamyan, they were at first subordinates of \"Sultan Abul-Fateh\" Ghiyāṣ-ud-din Muhammad bin Sām, Sultan of the Ghurid Empire, of whom they were related, and then as vassal princes within the Mongol Empire. Upon the fragmentation of the Ilkhanate in 1335, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn ibn Ghiyath-uddin worked to expand his principality. The death of Husayn b. Ghiyath-uddin in 1370 and the invasion of Timur in 1381, ended the Kart dynasty's ambitions.\n\nThe Karts trace their lineage to a Tajuddin Uthman Marghini, whose brother, 'Izzuddin Umar Marghini, was the Vizier of Sultan Ghiyāṣ-ud-din Muhammad bin Sām (d.1202-3). The founder of the Kart dynasty was Malik Rukn-uddin Abu Bakr, who was descended from the Shansabani family of Ghur.\n\nMalik Rukn-uddin Abu Bakr married a Ghurid princess. Their son Shams-uddin succeeded his father in 1245.\n\nShams-uddin Muhammad succeeded his father in 1245, joined Sali Noyan in an invasion of India in the following year, and met the Sufi Saint Baha-ud-din Zakariya at Multan in 1247-8. Later he visited the Mongol Great Khan Möngke Khan (1248–1257), who placed under his sway Greater Khorasan (present Afghanistan) and possibly region up to the Indus. In 1263-4, after having subdued Sistan, he visited Hulagu Khan, and three years later his successor Abaqa Khan, whom he accompanied in his campaign against Darband and Baku. He again visited Abaqa Khan, accompanied by Shams-uddin the \"Sahib Diwan\", in 1276-7, and this time the former good opinion of the Mongol sovereign in respect to him seems to have been changed to suspicion, which led to his death, for he was poisoned in January 1278, by means of a water-melon given to him while he was in the bath at Tabriz. Abaqa Khan even caused his body to be buried in chains at Jam in Khorasan.\n\nFakhr-uddin was a patron of literature, but also extremely religious. He had previously been cast in prison by his father for seven years, until the Ilkhanid general Nauruz intervened on his behalf. When Nauruz's revolt faltered around 1296, Fakhr-uddin offered him asylum, but when an Ilkhanid force approached Herat, he betrayed the general and turned him over to the forces of Ghazan. Three years later, Fakhr-uddin fought against Ghazan's successor Oljeitu, who shortly after his ascension in 1306 sent a force of 10,000 to take Herat. Fakhr-uddin, however, tricked the invaders by letting them occupy the city, and then destroying them, killing their commander Danishmand Bahadur in the process. He died on 26 February 1307. But Herat and Gilan were conquered by Oljeitu.\n\nSham-suddin Muhammad was succeeded by his son Rukn-uddin. The latter adopted the title of \"Malik\" (Arabic for king), which all succeeding Kart rulers were to use. By the time of his death; in Khaysar on 3 September 1305, effective power had long been in the hands of his son Fakhr-uddin.\n\nFakhr-uddin's brother Ghiyath-uddin succeeded him upon his death; almost immediately, he began to quarrel with another brother, Ala-uddin ibn Rukn-uddin. Taking his case before Oljeitu, who gave him a grand reception, he returned to Khurasan in 1307/8. Continuing troubles with his brother led him to visit the Ilkhan again in 1314/5. Upon returning to Herat, he found his territories being invaded by the Chagatai prince Yasa'ur, as well as hostility from Qutb-uddin of Isfizar and the populace of Sistan. A siege of Herat was set by Yasa'ur. The prince, however, was stopped by the armies of the Ilkhanate, and in August 1320, Ghiyath-uddin made a pilgrimage to Mecca, leaving his son Shams-uddin Muhammad ibn Ghiyath-uddin in control during his absence. In 1327 the \"Amir\" Chupan fled to Herat following his betrayal by the Ilkhan Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, where he requested asylum from Ghiyath-uddin, whom he was friends with. Ghiyath-uddin initially granted the request, but when Abu Sa'id pressured him to execute Chupan, he obeyed. Soon afterwards Ghiyath-uddin himself died, in 1329. He left four sons: Shams-uddin Muhammad ibn Ghiyath-uddin, Hafiz ibn Ghiyath-uddin, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn ibn Ghiyath-uddin, and Baqir ibn Ghiyath-uddin.\n\nFour years after Mu'izz-uddin Husayn ibn Ghiyath-uddin's ascension, the Ilkhan Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan died, following which the Ilkhanate quickly fragmented. Mu'izz-uddin Husayn, for his part, allied with Togha Temür, a claimant to the Ilkhanid throne, and paid tribute to him. Up until his death, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn's main concern were the neighboring Sarbadars, centered in Sabzavar. As the Sarbadars were the enemies of Togha Temür, they considered the Karts a threat and invaded. When the Karts and Sarbadars met in the Battle of Zava on 18 July 1342, the battle was initially in the favor of the latter, but disunity within the Sarbadar army allowed the Karts to emerge victorious. Thereafter, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn undertook several successful campaigns against the Chagatai Mongols to the northeast. During this time, he took a still young Timur into his service. In 1349, while Togha Temür was still alive, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn stopped paying tribute to him, and ruled as an independent \"Sultan\". Togha Temür's murder in 1353 by the Sarbadars ended that potential threat. Sometime around 1358, however, the Chagatai amir Qazaghan invaded Khurasan and sacked Herat. As he was returning home, Qazaghan was assassinated, allowing Mu'izz-uddin Husayn to reestablish his authority. Another campaign by the Sarbadars against Mu'izz-uddin Husayn in 1362 was aborted due to their internal disunity. Shortly afterwards, the Karts leader welcomed Shia dervishes fleeing from the Sarbadar ruler Ali-yi Mu'ayyad, who had killed their leader during the aborted campaign. In the meantime, however, relations with Timur became tense when the Karts launched a raid into his territory. Upon Mu'izz-uddin Husayn's death in 1370, his son Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali inherited most of the Kart lands, except for Sarakhs and a portion of Quhistan, which Ghiyas-uddin's stepbrother Malik Muhammad ibn Mu'izz-uddin gained.\n\nGhiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali, a grandson of Togha Temür through his mother Sultan Khatun, attempted to destabilize the Sarbadars by stirring up the refugee dervishes within his country. 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad countered by conspiring with Malik Muhammad. When Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali attempted to remove Malik Muhammad, 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad flanked his army and forced him to abort the campaign, instead compromising with his stepbrother. The Sarbadars, however, soon suffered a period of internal strife, and Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali took advantage of this by seizing the city of Nishapur around 1375 or 1376. In the meantime, both Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali and Malik Muhammad had asked for the assistance of Timur regarding their conflict: the former had sent an embassy to him, while the latter had appeared before Timur in person as a requester of asylum, having been driven out of Sarakhs. Timur responded to Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali by proposing a marriage between his niece Sevinj Qutluq Agha and the Kart ruler's son Pir Muhammad ibn Ghiyas-uddin, a marriage which took place in Samarkand around 1376. Later on, Timur invited Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali to a council, so that the latter could submit to him, but when the Kart attempted to excuse himself from coming by claiming he had to deal with the Shia population in Nishapur, Timur decided to invade. He was encouraged by many Khurasanis, included Mu'izzu'd-Din's former vizier Mu'in al-Din Jami, who sent a letter inviting Timur to intervene in Khurasan, and the shaikhs of Jam, who, being very influential persons, had convinced many of the Kart dignitaries to welcome Timur as the latter neared Herat. In April 1381, Timur arrived before the city, whose citizens were already demoralized and also aware of Timur's offer not to kill anyone that did not take part in the battle. The city fell, its fortifications were dismantled, theologians and scholars were deported to Timur's homeland, a high tribute was enacted, and Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali and his son were carried off to Samarkand. Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali was made Timur's vassal, until he supported a rebellion in 1382 by the maliks of Herat. Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali and his family were executed around 1383, and Timur's son Miran Shah destroyed the revolt. That same year, a new uprising led by a Shaikh Da'ud-i Khitatai in Isfizar was quickly put down by Miran Shah. The remaining Karts were murdered in 1396 at a banquet by Miran Shah. The Karts therefore came to an end, having been the victims of Timur's first Persian campaign.\n\n\"The colored rows signify the following;\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2215807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215807", "title": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais", "text": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais, Noyon, and Senlis (Latin: \"Dioecesis Bellovacensis, Noviomensis et Silvanectensis\"; French: \"Diocèse de Beauvais, Noyon et Senlis\") is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France. The diocese encompasses the department of Oise in the region of Hauts-de-France. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Reims. The current bishop is Jacques Benoit-Gonnin, appointed in 2010.\n\nThe Diocese of Beauvais was founded in the 3rd century, by St. Lucian (Lucianus, Lucien), according to a story first told in the 9th century. Gregory of Tours, who wrote in the second half of the 6th century, however, never speaks of the diocese of Beauvais or of any of its bishops. Neither does the name of Beauvais appear in the documents of any church council down to 695. \n\nAfter 1015 each Bishop of Beauvais was simultaneously Count of Beauvais, and one of the Peers of France. Count Odo of Beauvais had given all of his lands in his county to Bishop Roger and the Church of Beauvais, with the consent of King Robert; he also made the bishop his heir to the county. The Bishop had a role in the coronation ceremony of the French king, and played a role in politics.\n\nBishop Roger II died during the First Crusade, Philip of Dreux was a participant in the Third Crusade and the Battle of Bouvines, and Pierre Cauchon was the leading judge in the trial of Jeanne d'Arc.\n\nBeginning in 1100, a five year long period of ecclesiastical, social and political discord descended upon Beauvais, involving eventually Bishop Ivo of Chartres, Archbishop Manasses of Reims, two papal legates, Joannes of Saint Anastasia and Benedict of Saint Pudenziana, King Philip I of France, and Pope Paschal II. On the death of Bishop Ansellus of Beauvais in November 1099, it became evident that there were two opposed parties in the business of the election of a successor. One was the majority of the Chapter and the secular clergy of the diocese, who were accommodated to the social system of society and preferred matters as they were; the other was led by the clergy of Saint-Quentin, who were seeking reform and greater rigor, and who looked to Ivo of Chartres, formerly a priest in Saint-Quentin, for advice and support. The Chapter chose as its candidate Étienne de Garlande, fourth son of Guillaume, Seneschal of France, a protegé of the excommunicated King Philip I and his mistress Bertrade, who were no doubt expecting Garlande's aid in solving their matrimonial problems. He was not in holy orders at all, and yet was Dean of Orleans and Archdeacon of Paris. The other candidate, supported by the monks of Saint-Quentin, was Walon (Gualon), abbot of Saint-Quentin. In the election, Étienne obtained exactly enough votes to form a majority.\n\nIt happened that the ecclesiastical Province of Reims was holding a synod at Soissons, and the leaders of the winning party, the Dean and Archdeacons of Beauvais, went to announce the election and request that letters be sent to the King and the Pope on Etienne's behalf, and they petitioned Lambert of Arras, the Papal Visitor in the province to write to Pope Paschal as well. The letter to Lambert seriously misrepresented the facts in stating that the election was nearly unanimous. The losing party enlisted Ivo of Chartres, who made a detailed investigation into the deeds and character of Étienne Garlande. He found that Garlande was not in holy orders, that he was illiterate and addicted to gambling, that he had a bad moral reputation, that he had been excommunicated by the Legate Hugh de Die for public incontenence (which made him ineligible for ecclesiastical office), and that his election had been intrigued at by laymen who were excommunicated. He then wrote both to the papal legates, Joannes and Benedict, and to the Pope himself.\n\nThe Pope took the case, and Étienne had to make the journey to Rome to clear his reputation. He failed, but on his return to France, he extorted a letter of recommendation from Ivo of Chartres. The Pope, however, was not fooled, and quashed the election. A new election was ordered, and Lambert of Arras was ordered to preside at the election. The canonically convoked assembly elected Walon (Gualon) the Abbot of Saint-Quentin. The King, however, refused to recognize the election, and Prince Louis made a statement to the effect that Walon would never be bishop of Beauvais, and that the King should install Étienne immediately, which was done. The Pope, however, ratified the election of Gualon, and issued a mandate to Archbishop Manasses of Reims to consecrate him. The Archbishop was a friend of the Court, though, and had crowned the excommunicated King. He procrastinated in taking action. Gualon, therefore, set out for Rome, where he so impressed the Pope that Paschal appointed him Apostolic Legate to Poland. In the meantime the Church of Beauvais sank into disorder, with two competing jurisdictions, that of the uncanonical and unconsecrated Étienne, and that of the Vicars appointed by the Chapter in the absence of a consecrated bishop. The King raged against the Chapter and exiled several of the Canons, and Ivo of Chartres consoled it with the knowledge that it was canonically justified.\n\nFinally, Ivo worked out a settlement with the King. Prince Louis held a meeting in Beauvais with the Chapter in January 1104, which brought peace to the city. Since the diocese of Paris happened to be vacant, the Pope authorized the transfer of bishop-elect Gualon to the diocese of Paris, and the seat of Beauvais was declared to be vacant. In December the King was reconciled to the Church, and his excommunication was lifted.\n\nA synod was held in Beauvais in 845, in the presence of King Charles the Bald, during a \"sede vacante\" of the See of Beauvais. The synod ratified the election of Hincmar as Archbishop of Reims.\n\nOn 6 December 1114 a Council was held in Beauvais, presided over by the Papal Legate Cardinal Kuno von Erach (Conon, Kono). The Archbishops of Reims, Bourges and Sens and their suffragans participated. The Emperor Henry V was again anathematized, along with the Bishop of Münster and Count Thomas de Marla, who enjoyed raving the areas of Laon, Reims and Amiens. The case of Bishop Geoffroy of Amiens, who had been driven from his city by the burghers, was discussed, and his resignation was submitted. The discovery of Manichaean heretics in the diocese of Soissons was discussed, but action was deferred until the next synod.\n\nCardinal Kuno von Erach held another synod in Beauvais, on 18 October 1120. The purpose was to decide on the sainthood of Bishop Arnulf of Soissons (died 1087). The synod accepted his sanctity and authorized the moving of his remains from the convent of Aldenbourg in the diocese of Tournai to the cathedral of Soissons.\n\nThere is a note in the \"Chronicon Malleacense\" that a council took place at Beauvais in 1124. Nothing at all is known about it.\n\nIn 1160 an important council was convoked at Beauvais by King Louis VII of France. The papal Conclave of 1159 had produced a schism between Pope Alexander III and the puppet of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Octavianus de' Monticelli, Cardinal of S. Cecilia, who called himself Victor IV. The council agreed with the King that Alexander III was the true pope, a judgment that was confirmed in a joint meeting held by Louis VII and Henry II of England at Toulouse in the autumn of 1160.\n\nBeauvais, which was situated close to the frontier between English and French territories, was frequently subjected to attack and siege from the English and their allies, especially the Burgundians.\n\nThe celebrated Battle of Agincourt took place only a few miles north of Beauvais on 25 October 1415.\n\nOn 1 June 1427, Bishop Pierre Cauchon, who was a partisan of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and no supporter of Charles VII, was one of the consecrators of Jacques du Chastellier, the English candidate for the bishopric of Paris. He fled from Beauvais as Charles' armies appeared in the area, led by Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc). Cauchon took refuge in Rouen, where he was induced by the English to sit as judge in the trial of Joan, who had been captured on 23 May 1430. After a contentious trial he pronounced her guilty, and had her turned over to the secular authorities to be burned as an heretic. He also assisted at the coronation of the English King Henry VI in Paris on 17 December 1431.\n\nIn 1452 the case was reopened on orders of Pope Nicholas V by Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, cousin of a former bishop of Beauvais, but the proceedings did not lead to a definitive conclusion. In 1455 they were begun again on orders of the new pope, Calixtus III, and the bishop of Beauvais at the time, Bishop Guillaume de Hellande, as successor of Pierre Cauchon, was required to provide defense attorneys to argue the case for Cauchon's right conduct. The court issued its judgment on 7 June 1456: \"We say, pronounce, decree and declare the said Processes and Sentences full of cozenage, iniquity, inconsequences, and manifest errors, in fact as well as in law. We say that they have been, and are, and shall be—as well as the aforesaid Abjuration, their execution, and all that followed—null, nonexistent, without value or effect.\"\n\nIn 1472 Beauvais was attacked and besieged by forces of the Duke of Burgundy. Their leader, Philippe de Crevecoeur, Sieur d'Esquerdes (des Cordes) launched the attack on 27 June, which broke through the fortifications and seized the faubourg de Saint-Quentin. Bishop Jean de Bar immediately mounted his horse and tried to leave the city, heading for Paris to obtain royal aid, but he was stopped by the defenders, who had orders to allow no one to leave the city. Matters were clarified, and the bishop was in Paris on July 1. He offered the leaders of the commune nearly 1,000 livres which the King had given for the construction of the cathedral. The Seigneur de Tressures had also ridden out and obtained several thousand troops from various sources, including Robert d'Estouteville, Provost of Paris. In the meantime, the church of Saint-Hippolyte, which had been taken by the besiegers, was destroyed by fire, and the episcopal palace, next to the ramparts, took fire in three places, perhaps by arson. Assaults continued through 6 July, at which there was a pause until the 9th. In the third assault, when the Burgundian standard was planted on the ramparts, a courageous Beauvasienne, Jeanne Hachette, grabbed it and threw it back down into the ditch, rallying the citizens to throw back the Burgundians, and even to mount a nighttime attack on the Burgundian camp which killed over 200, many of them officers. After losses of more than 3,000 men, the Duke of Burgundy abandoned the siege on 22 July. Three days later, the bishop celebrated a Mass. The Abbey of Saint-Quentin had been rendered uninhabitable.\n\nIn 875, Bishop Odo, with the consent of King Charles the Bald, as an act of considerable generosity, increased the number of Canons in the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre to fifty. Around the year 1320, the Cathedral was served by a Chapter composed of eight dignities (not 'dignitaries') and forty canons. The dignities were: the Dean (who was also Archdeacon of Bray), the Treasurer, the Archdeacon of Beauvais, the Archdeacon of Belvacinio, the Cantor, the Succentor, the Penitentiary, and the Chancellor. The Dean was elected by the Chapter, the others were episcopal appointments. By 1679 the dignities had been reduced to five.\n\nSix of the churches in Beauvais were also capitular churches: Saint-Nicolas (6 prebends), Saint-Bartholomew (7 prebends), Saint-Michel (13 prebends), Saint-Laurent (7 prebends), Nôtre-Dame du Châtel (12 prebends), and Saint-Vaast (11 prebends). These offices were all benefices, in the gift of the bishop or of the Chapter, and provided a regular income for the incumbents. These offices were a way of rewarding faithful followers. There was also a Collegiate Church at Geberoy (headed by a Dean, with 5 prebends, later 12 prebends).\n\nIn 1516 King Francis I signed at treaty with Pope Leo X, which has come to be called the Concordat of Bologna, in which the King and his successors acquired the right to nominate each and every one of the bishops in France, except those of the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun.\n\nDuring the French Revolution the diocese of Beauvais was suppressed by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'Oise', which was coterminous with the new civil department of the same name. Oise was made part of the Metropolitanate called the 'Métropole des Cotes de la Manche'. The new Civil Constitution mandated that bishops be elected by the citizens of each 'département', which immediately raised the most severe issues in Canon Law, since the electors did not need to be Catholics and the approval of the Pope was not only not required, but actually forbidden. Erection of new dioceses and transfer of bishops, moreover, was not canonically in the competence of civil authorities or of the Church in France. The result was schism between the 'Constitutional Church' and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe legitimate bishop of Beauvais, François-Joseph de la Rochefoucauld, declined to take the required oath to the Civil Constitution, and betook himself to Paris, where he was accused and arrested. He was imprisoned in the monastery of the Carmelites, along with his brother, Pierre Louis, who was Bishop of Saintes. Both were massacred on 2 September 1792.\n\nIn 1791 the electors of 'Oise' assembled and elected as their Constitutional Bishop a priest, Jean-Baptiste Massieu, who had been a teacher, first at Vernon, and then at Nancy. He became cure of Cergy near Pontoise in 1782, and was elected to the Estates General for the bailliage of Senlis. He was in Paris at the time of his election, serving as an active member of the Ecclesiastical Committee which had drawn up the civil Constitution. He had just been elected secretary of the Legislative Assembly. He was consecrated at Notre-Dame de Paris on 6 March 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel, the seventh constitutional bishop to be consecrated. His behavior became more and more radical, during 1791 and 1792. He voted in favor of the execution of King Louis XVI. He resigned the priesthood and helped to organize the Terror. He married the daughter of the mayor of Givet, and presided at the Festivals of Reason. Complaints against him were so frequent, however, that he was delated to the Committee of Public Safety, and condemned on 9 August 1794. Somehow he escaped the guillotine and was pardoned in October 1794, and given a post as teacher in the school at Versailles. He had no successor in the Constitutional church, which he had helped to make universally loathed in the former diocese of Beauvais.\n\nThe territory of the former diocese of Beauvais was made part of the Diocese of Amiens when legitimate ecclesiastical government was restored in 1802. Church property, which had been confiscated for the public good by the Constitutional Assembly, was not restored. Bishops and priests therefore continued to be dependent upon salaries paid to them by the State, a practice which continued down until the Law of the Separation of the Churches and the State of 1905. The Diocese of Beauvais was re-established in 1822, and the Diocese of Beauvais, Noyon, and Senlis was created in 1851, comprising the territories of all three formerly separate dioceses. Beauvais Cathedral serves as the seat of the enlarged diocese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At time of publication, court orders to suppress publication while Hardy was tried for criminal libel mirrored much larger scale McCarthyist censorship and anti-communist trials in USA. Ultimately Hardy was cleared and publication allowed.\n\nThe book was later adapted into a mini-series by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1976), which at the time, obtained great success. Hardy wrote several books examining his experiences arising from writing \"Power Without Glory,\" including \"The Hard Way,\" \"Who Shot George Kirkland?,\" and \"But the Dead are Many.\" In these a central theme is the ambiguity between truth and fiction.\n\nThe work was originally self-published, with illustrations by Hardy's friend and fellow Communist \"Amb\" Dyson, with the rubric \"a novel in three parts by Frank J. Hardy, Ross Franklyn\". \"Ross Franklyn\" was the pseudonym Hardy had always used prior to \"Power Without Glory\". This combination of real name and pen name was also used in Hardy's 1961 book \"The Hard Way\" which describes the difficulties \"Ross Franklyn\" had in having the book published, and the problems Frank Hardy faced in answering the criminal libel charge against him arising from the publication.\n\nThe novel is a fictional tale about the compromises of a life of power and corruption, through exploration of motivations behind the powergrab of a character largely inspired by the life of Melbourne businessman and Australian Labor Party power-broker, John Wren. Highly revealing about the systems and stratagems in place in Australian politics in the era 1880-1950, it is largely set in the fictitious Melbourne suburb of Carringbush, which is based on the actual suburbs of Abbotsford and Collingwood. In the novel, \"John West\" is involved in criminal activities and political machinations, particularly related to gambling.\n\nThe book includes many characters based on other important social and political figures in Victoria and Australia, including the following recognisable correlates:\n\n\nA fuller list of characters and locations is provided in the following section Characters and real-life correlates.\n\nThe barely-disguised inspiration for the \"West\" character is made clear by the fact that West, like Wren, has a brother called \"Arthur\" who spent time in jail for aiding and abetting a crime of rape. (Wren's other brother, Joseph, also appears in the novel.) Wren's wife Ellen (née Mahon) appears as \"Nellie\", and there is mention in the novel of his children: his violinist daughter Margaret, his son John Jr., and another daughter, who becomes a Communist, resembles Wren's radical daughter Mary, who was an active member of the communist front organisation the Movement Against War and Fascism.\n\nThe novel is partly set during World War I, and the debate about conscription is a major issue in the novel. John West is a fierce patriot who supports conscription, and his sometimes fiery arguments with the Irish-Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, who opposes conscription on the grounds that to send men to aid England was contrary to his, and Ireland's, historical enmity with that country.\n\nIn the final chapters the book timeline approaches the real-world at time of publication, with threats against publication and simply feeling a need to get the thing finished, as well as keeping the work to a manageable length, Hardy writes in \"The Hard Way\" that he felt somewhat dissatisfied at the hurried result of this section.\n\nWrapping up is John West on his deathbed (the real John Wren was still very much alive at time of publishing!) having allowed his growing hatred of Communism and fear of adverse judgement in The Afterlife of the Catholic Church finally overcome his material self-interest at least to the degree that he allows Malone to dig deeper and ever deeper into the West fortune in support of B.A. Santamaria's anti-communist catholic church-based Movement and related political maneuvering, even allowing Malone's candidate precedence in the electoral gaming. Ultimately in real life, the Movement's Industrial Groups were to subsequently gain sufficient dominance within Labour, to defeat and virtually completely suppress Australian communism, including by alliance with the Liberal party Menzies government to attempt criminalisation of the Communist Party of Australia.\n\nThe following list attempts to align Power Without Glory characters with real historical persons who may have been inspirational to the author. Recognisable features do not necessarily imply any attempt at an exact correlation. Hardy himself conceded or even affirmed some such correlations, but says in \"The Hard Way\" that many such lists were being created and passed around by parties without his involvement, perhaps even without his knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nHardy was tried for criminal libel in 1951 on the basis of the depiction in the novel of West's wife having an affair but he was acquitted by jury, after putting a number of arguments and cross-examining witnesses. It was the last prosecution for criminal (as opposed to civil) libel in Victoria.\n\nThe case attracted enormous publicity, coinciding as it did with the anti-Communist referendum and served mainly to give the novel and any negative portrayal of Wren greater prominence. Hardy later detailed his experiences during the case in his book \"The Hard Way\" where he denies ever having spoken to any member of the Wren family during his extensive research for the book, and claims the relevant portions were entirely fictional.\n\nAccording to Hardy's recollections in \"The Hard Way\", the case differed from a civil law defamation case in that the defence of truth and public interest was not available at all, while a separate defence of lack of likelihood of public unrest resulting from the publication, which he thought should be available, was disallowed by the Judge.\n\nHardy readily conceded that he had published the work, and so the defence was built on the remaining two points, of whether the informant Ellen Wren was in fact identical with the character Nellie West, and if so, whether in fact the publication was defamatory.\n\nWitnesses had testified that they recognised Ellen, and that she had been defamed. Hardy's defence, as described in \"The Hard Way,\" successfully cross-examined many witnesses such that it was shown that Ellen was only recognisable as Nellie by the latter's connection to John West, and that John West, though easily recognised as John Wren, was at the same time, a synthesised character, based on traits of John Wren but with many story events that were not attributable to the real John Wren.\n\nThis also attempted to use the fundamental contradiction in the prosecutions case, that if the characters were not true-to-life in every way, then were they not by necessity fictional? However this may have been insufficient to convince the jury, and certainly did not lead to any dismissal on technical grounds.\n\nHardy would have like to have used another argument, that if John West was truly John Wren, and the many dreadful things attributed to him in the novel were therefore true, then there was a public interest defence in exposing him. However this was disallowed as a technicality of the defence because of the criminal libel law being used, and was apparently somewhat ineffective as an implicit line put to the jury, since testimony was given by witnesses such that Wren could be identical with West without every feature being identical, i.e. that false defamatory attributes might be attached to a character whose identity is obvious due to known true attributes.\n\nHardy's defence also put that the character Ellen was portrayed sympathetically, that it was due to hardships suffered by her in her marriage to the dreadful John West that she resorted to the acts claimed as defamatory by the prosecution. While some witnesses had testified that her act of disloyalty stood as the most egregious act in the book, hence the attempt to prosecute Hardy over this section, rather than any of the acts such as murder, terrorism, bribery, ballot-rigging, race-fixing etc. committed by John West and his cohorts. Yet on cross-examination it was discovered that the witnesses could see Ellen's plight sympathetically.\n\nAccording to a 2005 article in Melbourne newspaper \"The Age\"\n, Monash University academic (and \"The Age\" contributor ) Jenny Hocking, claims to have special insight after reading notes and letters from material held at the Australian National Archive (or perhaps at the Defence Force). This supports the belief that Angela became Annette, then Xavier and therefore the affair may really have happened, and that Hardy had somehow known of this and written about it in the novel. \n\nIn The Hard Way, Hardy said that he had not really meant to say that anything literal had happened, and anyway, he wouldn't have known because he never spoke to anyone who could know. Even were it provably true, this could not have helped him defend a case of criminal libel (but cf Wikipedia, citing ) and it remains untested as to whether truth would be relevant to a public-interest defence in a civil case. A defence may have required that it be in the public interest that facts became public concerning the legitimacy of a private citizen who held no public office and had no public profile, or the moral rectitude of that person's private citizen parent who happened to have married a young John Wren.\n\nIn 1976, the novel was made into a 26-episode ABC-TV series starring Martin Vaughan as West. While Nellie's affair with the brickie is depicted, the affair does not produce a child. The series won numerous Logie, Penguin and Sammy Awards.\n\nThe football commentator Rex Hunt habitually refers to Collingwood as \"the Carringbush\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2215876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215876", "title": "Burrow", "text": "Burrow\n\nA burrow is a hole or tunnel excavated into the ground by an animal to create a space suitable for habitation, temporary refuge, or as a byproduct of locomotion. Burrows provide a form of shelter against predation and exposure to the elements and can be found in nearly every biome and among various biological interactions. Many different animal species are known to form burrows. These species range from small invertebrates, such as the \"Corophium arenarium\", to very large vertebrate species such as the polar bear. Burrows can be constructed into a wide variety of substrates and can range in complexity from a simple tube a few centimeters long to a complex network of interconnecting tunnels and chambers hundreds or thousands of meters in total length. An example of this well-developed burrow would be a rabbit warren. \n\nA wide variety of vertebrates construct or use burrows in many different types of substrate and can range widely in complexity. Some examples of vertebrate burrowing animals include a number of mammals, amphibians, fish (dragonet and lungfish), reptiles, and birds (including small dinosaurs). Mammals are perhaps most well known for burrowing. Mammal species such as Insectivora like the voracious mole, and rodents like the prolific gopher, great gerbil and groundhog are often found to form burrows. Some other mammals that are known to burrow are the platypus, pangolin, pygmy rabbit, armadillo, rat and weasel. The rabbit, a member of the family Lagomorpha, is a well-known burrower. Some species such as the groundhog can construct burrows that occupy a full cubic metre, displacing about 300 kilograms of dirt. There is evidence that rodents may construct the most complex burrows of all vertebrate burrowing species. For example, great gerbils live in family groups in extensive burrows, which can be seen on satellite images. Even the unoccupied burrows can remain visible in the landscape for years. The burrows are distributed regularly, although the occupied burrows appear to be clustered in space. Even Carnivora like the meerkat, and marsupials, are burrowers. The largest burrowing animal is probably the polar bear when it makes its maternity den in snow or earth. Lizards are also known to create and live in burrows, and may exhibit territorial behaviour over the burrows as well. There is also evidence that a burrow provides protection for the Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (\"Tiliqua adelaidensis\") when fighting, as they may fight from inside their burrows. \n\nBurrows by birds are usually made in soft soils; some penguins and other pelagic seabirds are noted for such burrows. The Magellanic penguin is an example, constructing burrows along coastal Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina. Other burrowing birds are puffins, kingfishers, and bee-eaters.\n\nKangaroo mice construct burrows in fine sand.\n\nScabies mites construct their burrows in the skin of the infested animal or human. Termites and some wasps construct burrows in the soil and wood. Ants construct burrows in the soil. Some sea urchins and clams can burrow into rock.\n\nThe burrows produced by invertebrate animals can be filled actively or passively. Dwelling burrows which remain open during the occupation by an organism are filled passively, by gravity rather than by the organism. Actively filled burrows, on the other hand, are filled with material by the burrowing organism itself.\n\nThe establishment of an invertebrate burrow often involves the soaking of surrounding sediment in mucus in order to prevent collapse and to seal off water flow.\n\nExamples of burrowing invertebrates are insects, spiders, sea urchins, crustaceans, clams and worms.\n\nAnimals can create burrows using a variety of methods. Burrowing animals can be divided into three categories: primary excavators, secondary modifiers and simple occupants. Primary excavators are the animals that originally dig and construct the burrow, and are generally very strong. Some animals considered to be primary excavators are the prairie dog and the aardvark. Pygmy gerbil are an example of secondary modifiers, as they do not build an original burrow, but will live inside a burrow made by other animals and improve or change some aspects of the burrow for their own purpose. The third category, simple occupants, neither build nor modify the burrow but simply live inside or use it for their own purpose. Some species of Bird will actually make use of burrows built by tortoises, which is an example of simple occupancy. These animals can also be referred to as commensals.\n\nSome species may spend the majority of their days inside a burrow, indicating it must have good conditions and provide some benefit to the animal. Burrows may be used by certain species as protection from harsh conditions, or from predators. Burrows may be found facing the direction of sunlight or away from the direction of cold wind. This could help with heat retention and insulation, providing protection from temperatures and conditions outside. Insects such as the earwig may create burrows to live in during the winter season, and use them for physical protection. Some species will also use burrows to store and protect food. This provides a benefit to the animal as it can keep food away from other competition. It also allows the animal to keep a good stock of food inside the burrow to avoid extreme weather conditions or seasons where certain food sources may be unavailable. Additionally, burrows can provide protection to animals that have just had their young, providing good conditions and safety for vulnerable newborn animals. Burrows may also provide shelter to animals residing in areas frequently destroyed by fire, as animals deep underground in a burrow may be kept dry, safe and at a stable temperature.\n\nBurrows are also commonly preserved in the fossil record as burrow fossils, a type of trace fossil.\n\n"}

He is best known for having been detained by the People's Republic of China on allegations of spying for Taiwan. He was imprisoned from April 2005 to February 2008; spending more than 1,000 days in prison.\n\nChing was born in Guangzhou, China on 3 December 1949. He was educated in St. Paul's College, Hong Kong, and graduated from Hong Kong University in 1973 with a degree in Economics.\n\nIn 1974, he joined the pro-Communist China newspaper Wen Wei Po (), of which he eventually became vice-editorial manager. After the Tiananmen massacre of 4 June 1989, Ching and around 40 other journalists resigned from the newspaper in protest. After that he, Li Zhisong, and others founded \"Commentary\", a magazine commenting on China. \n\nIn 1996 he joined the staff of the Singapore-based \"Straits Times\". At first he was assigned to the Taiwan desk, where his articles clearly showed a pro-unification stance. These articles are collected in a book called \" 'Will Taiwan Break Away: The Rise of Taiwanese Nationalism' \". Ching was later named China correspondent for the journal.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, he entered mainland China on a Home Return Permit, while researching former Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang. On 22 April 2005, he was charged with spying on behalf of a foreign intelligence agency and was arrested in Guangzhou.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry later reported that he had confessed to these accusations. Formal charges were drawn up on 5 August. He was charged with passing state secrets to the Republic of China (Taiwan) over a period of five years. In particular, he was accused of using money provided by Taiwan to purchase political and military information. He is the first Hong Kong journalist to be charged with spying since the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC in 1997. Ching's wife, Mary Lau, said the charges were 'ludicrous'. She also added that Ching had apparently fallen victim to entrapment by an intermediary as he was trying to obtain recordings of secret interviews with the former Prime Minister.\n\nIn June 2005, the Hong Kong Journalists Association and Reporters Without Borders organised a petition calling for Ching's immediate release from unfair detention. The petition, containing more than 13,000 signatures, was sent to Hu Jintao, then President of the People's Republic of China. The International Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists also protested Ching Cheong's detention. The British Government was also asked to intervene as Ching Cheong held a British National (Overseas) passport.\n\nDuring the incident, some tabloids in Hong Kong insinuated that he was spying because he had to earn money for a mistress in China. The supposed mistress went to Hong Kong from China and gave witness that she had no relationship with Ching. The accusation ceased when a lot of evidence showed that Ching Cheong was innocent.\n\nOn 12 January 2006, 35 legislative councillors including 10 pro-Beijing councillors (including three from the Liberal Party, three from the DAB, and one from the Alliance Party) signed an open letter asking the Chinese authorities to release Ching unless there was sufficient evidence.\n\nOn 22 February 2006, the prosecutor in charge of Ching's case decided to send his file back to the State Security Department for further investigation. The trial was thus delayed for at least one month.\n\nChing was tried \"in camera\", found guilty of spying, and was sentenced on 31 August 2006 to five years' imprisonment.\nThe family's statement on the same day stated the verdict was extremely biased, adopting only evidence of the Procuratorate while ignoring almost all defence arguments and Ching's defence.\n\nOn 1 September 2006 Ching's wife reported that her husband had called the verdict \"very unfair\" and vowed to appeal the sentence.\n\nOn 5 February 2008, the Chinese government announced that they had released Ching from prison early, days before the Chinese New Year holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station was named for the workers of the Komsomol youth league who helped to construct the first Metro line. It has a transfer at the-same-called-station on the Koltsevaya line.\n\nKomsomolskaya was built using the cut and cover method, with construction beginning on 3 May 1933. Temporary bridges were built over the construction site to avoid disrupting traffic, especially the numerous tram routes in the area. To counteract the high water table, the station was built on 636 piles which were driven into the saturated soil.\n\nHeavy rains in the summer of 1934 threatened the construction site several times, and at one point even the Kazansky terminal was in danger of collapsing. Nevertheless, the concrete structure of the station was completed by August 26 and Komsomolskaya opened on schedule on May 15, 1935.\n\nDue to Komsomolskaya's location under a major transit hub, the station was built with an unusual upper gallery above the platform to help handle rush crowds. The station has tall pillars faced with pinkish limestone and topped with bronze capitals displaying the emblem of the Komsomol league. The station was designed by Dmitry Chechulin, and a model of it was displayed at the 1937 Paris World's fair.\n\nThe station's southern entrance vestibule is built into the Kazansky Rail Terminal.

The character has been active as both a superhero and a supervillain. He has been a member of Alpha Flight, X-Factor, and Weapon X.\n\nHe was created by John Byrne and appeared in a cameo appearance in \"Alpha Flight\" #1 (Aug 1983), but he did not appear in full until \"Alpha Flight\" #11.\n\nKyle Gibney is a mutant who manifested a feral mutation during puberty; this mutation granted him enhanced physical abilities and an increased rate of regeneration. He also suffered from a bestial freakish appearance, which prompted his parents to throw him out of their house. Living on the streets, he was kidnapped by the conspiratorial Secret Empire and subjected to mind- and body-altering experiments. The experiments had the consequence of making him psychologically unstable, and in particular prone to violent and animalistic behavior. During this time, he became acquainted with Dr. Valerie Cooper, a United States government official who was unaware of the Secret Empire's true nature or activities. He was freed by Wyre, the man who had unwittingly been the source for the genetic material that was used in the Empire's experiments.\n\nGibney (now Wild Child) was detained by the military and given over to the custody of Canada's secret Department H, who oversaw the formative Alpha Flight team. The Flight member Walter Langkowski, wanting to protect the youth from the military, placed him in the trainee team dubbed Gamma Flight. After Alpha Flight and its trainee groups were officially disbanded, Gibney was recruited to join the first Omega Flight team, a group of professional criminals. Alongside Omega Flight, he battled Alpha Flight and was defeated. Alongside Omega Flight, he battled Alpha Flight again in the West Edmonton Mall, and was defeated by Madison Jeffries. Afterwards, he committed a series of murders, which ended when he battled and was captured by Wolverine after he severely injured and almost killed Alpha Flight member Heather Hudson.\n\nWild Child was subsequently pardoned under unrevealed circumstances and given membership in the new Gamma Flight. Alongside Gamma Flight, he battled Alpha Flight. However, he then aided Gamma and Alpha Flight against Llan the Sorcerer's forces. When Gamma Flight was disbanded soon after that, he went berserk over his deprecated status and attacked Pathway, another trainee. Gamma's leader Nemesis teleported him away during a fight with Heather Hudson (then Guardian) and Wolverine, and he was captured by Wolverine. Department H would later help him overcome his psychological problems and cure his mental illness, train him in unarmed combat, and place him as a special operative of the Canadian government assigned to Alpha Flight under the codename Weapon Omega. Alongside Alpha Flight, he battled Diablo. He joined Alpha Flight's \"Core Alpha\", met the second X-Factor team, and prevented the mind-controlled Omerta from assassinating Italy's head of state. He also fought a Wild Child doppelganger during the Infinity War. He was attacked by Wyre but rescued by Alpha Flight. He searched for Nemesis, and was held prisoner with her by Rok, but they were then rescued by Weapon X. He defeated Wyre in personal combat; he then learned about his true origin, and changed his codename to Wildheart. He aided Alpha Flight in combat with the Wrecker. He also became romantically involved with his teammate Aurora.\n\nHis appearance eventually deteriorated back to his initial feral form, which prompted him to leave Alpha Flight and Aurora. He followed Valerie Cooper to the United States, where he joined the government operated team X-Factor. There he began a romantic relationship with his teammate Shard. His feral teammate Sabretooth frequently attempted, with little success, to convince Wild Child to become a hunter and killer like himself. He remained with the team until his body began mutating towards a more feral form. He eventually degenerated to a near-mindless state and was recruited (either willingly or via brainwashing) by the new Weapon X team.\n\nAs part of his draft, Wild Child was paired with Sabretooth to try and recruit Sunfire to the program. The Japanese mutant refused and badly burned Sabretooth. When Wild Child mocked his burns Sabretooth viciously sliced through Kyle's vocal cords and threatened to kill any Weapon X medical staff who would operate on him, making sure that he would remain mute.\n\nHis past flame, Aurora, was also recruited into the team but she was not herself. After the Weapon X upgrades she became cocky and aloof, snubbing the ugly Wild Child and even engaging in a relationship with the horribly disfigured Director of the program. This became fuel for the fire when Brent Jackson attempted to undermine the authority of the Director Malcolm Colcord. Using Aurora's attitude toward him as motive, Jackson convinced Wild Child to join his splinter group.\n\nWild Child was seen on a terminal screen as one of the mutants depowered after M-Day. His energy signature was found within the entity known as The Collective, along with the energy signatures of many other depowered mutants.\n\nWild Child recently demonstrated that his powers had returned as well as previously erased memories. He even managed to best Wolverine in a quick fight. He is now looking like his old Wildheart persona.\n\nWild Child appeared once more in conflict with Wolverine aiding Omega Red and attempting to kill Logan. He was doing so under the order of the enigmatic Romulus. His plan consisted of dropping Logan into molten steel; however, he was interrupted by Omega Red. While Wild Child and Omega Red battled each other, Logan managed to flee. Omega Red succeeded in distracting Wild Child and thus was able to impale him on his coils before throwing him into a vat of molten steel.\n\nKyle Gibney is a mutant who was experimented upon, genetically engineered by Secret Empire scientists using DNA replicated from Wyre. He has superhumanly acute senses, as well as superhuman speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance. His teeth and nails are hardened and strong enough to rend substances as thick as bone. His body heals at a rate several times greater than that of a normal human being but not at the rate of Sabretooth's healing factor. He also has various animal-like mutations common for \"feral\" mutants: leaf-shaped ears; eyes with neither pupils nor irises; sharper-than-normal teeth with pronounced, fang-like canines; and elongated fingernails and toenails which can be used as claw-like weapons, as well as his hunched body posture. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with both special ops and martial arts training from Wolverine as well as the Canadian government's superhero Flight program, and is also trained in acrobatics and gymnastics. In his bestial rages, he relies more on sheer ferocity than fighting skill. As Wildheart, the savage, bestial side of his personality was suppressed by an unknown drug, but his savage self still threatened to overwhelm his sanity at all times.\n\nAs a result of injuries suffered at the hands of Sabretooth, who prevented him from getting medical treatment, Wildchild was mute for a time. However, along with his renewed powers, he seems to have regained the ability to speak as well.\n\nIn the \"Age of Apocalypse\" alternate timeline, Wild Child was a member of the X-Men and was frequently partnered with Sabretooth. Wild Child possessed a low level of intelligence (comparable to that of a dog) and an inability to communicate verbally. As such, he was kept on a chain leash to prevent him from harming any of the X-Men. For a time, he was Sabretooth's sidekick, as Creed had rescued Wild Child from being a prisoner of Apocalypse's son Holocaust but his current fate is unknown. The 2005 \"Handbook to the Age of Apocalypse\" states that Kyle is away on a secret mission with the other X-Men who were not present during the \"Age of Apocalypse\" 10th Anniversary Limited Series, though when Sabretooth and Blink revisited their home reality during a mission as Exiles, Magneto and Rogue revealed to them that Kyle had run away after Victor and Clarice had disappeared when they were taken away by the Tallus. He was eventually found and claimed by . He then moved to the latter's reality to replace its deceased Wild Child, who was not supposed to have died.\n\nWild Child has since been returned to the \"Age of Apocalypse\" timeline as he is seen following and later confronting the X-Force. He is killed while, along with the X-Men from his world and X-Force, trying to stop Archangel's genocidal plans on Earth-616.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" reality, Wild Child (alongside Arclight and Mentallo) is a Red Guard member positioned in Australia to serve Exodus.\n\nIn the \"Mutant X\" alternate reality, Wild Child roams the wilds of Canada, feral, along with that reality's version of Sabretooth and Wolverine, both as feral as he. They operated under the name \"The Pack.\" For a time, the hero known as the Brute ran with them.\n\nKyle is still a part of the splinter group of Weapon X, run by Brent Jackson.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Wild Child appears in \"Ultimate Comics: Wolverine\" #2. He and a few of his soldiers were tracking Wolverine's son, Jimmy Hudson to kill his adopted parents, the Hudsons: James Hudson and Heather Hudson. Jimmy pounces but is almost killed by Wild Child till Quicksilver appears and twists his neck around.\n\n\nThe Age of Apocalypse version of Wild Child was also made into a non-posable figure pack-in with Sabertooth for the Age of Apocalypse toyline manufactured by ToyBiz.\n\n"}

{"id": "2215958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215958", "title": "Forest ecology", "text": "Forest ecology\n\n[[Image:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia\nForest ecology is the scientific study of the interrelated patterns, processes, [[flora]], [[fauna]] and [[ecosystem]]s in [[forests]]. The management of forests is known as [[forestry]], [[silviculture]], and [[forest management]]. A forest [[ecosystem]] is a natural woodland unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[Biotic component]]s) in that area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment. The forest ecosystem is very important.\n\n[[Image: Redwood M D Vaden.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood]] tree in northern California forest, where many trees are managed for preservation and longevity]]\n\nForest ecology is one branch of a biotically-oriented [[Categorization|classification]] of types of ecological study (as opposed to a classification based on organizational level or complexity, for example [[Population ecology|population]] or [[community ecology]]). Thus, forests are studied at a number of organizational levels, from the individual [[organism]] to the ecosystem. However, as the term [[forest]] connotes an area inhabited by more than one [[organism]], forest ecology most often concentrates on the level of the [[population]], [[community]] or ecosystem. Logically, [[tree]]s are an important component of forest research, but the wide variety of other life forms and [[abiotic components]] in most forests means that other elements, such as [[wildlife]] or [[soil]] [[nutrients]], are often the focal point. Thus, forest [[ecology]] is a highly diverse and important branch of ecological study.\n\nForest ecology studies share characteristics and methodological approaches with other areas of [[terrestrial plant]] ecology. However, the presence of trees makes forest ecosystems and their study unique in numerous ways.\n\nSince trees can grow larger than other plant life-forms, there is the potential for a wide variety of forest structures (or physiognomies). The infinite number of possible spatial arrangements of trees of varying size and species makes for a highly intricate and diverse micro-environment in which environmental variables such as [[solar radiation]], temperature, [[relative humidity]], and [[wind speed]] can vary considerably over large and small distances. In addition, an important proportion of a forest ecosystem's [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] is often underground, where soil structure, [[water quality]] and quantity, and levels of various soil nutrients can vary greatly. Thus, forests are often highly [[heterogeneous]] environments compared to other [[terrestrial plant]] communities. This heterogeneity in turn can enable great biodiversity of species of both plants and animals. Some structures, such as tree ferns may be keystone species for a diverse range of other species.\nA number of factors within the forest affect biodiversity; primary factors enhancing wildlife abundance and biodiversity are the presence of diverse tree species within the forest and the absence of [[even aged timber management]]. For example, the [[wild turkey]] thrives when uneven heights and [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] variations exist and its numbers are diminished by even aged timber management.\nForest management techniques that mimic natural disturbance events ([[variable retention forestry]] ) can allow community diversity to recover rapidly for a variety of groups including beetles.\n\n[[File:RockyPointTrailAsFirebreak.jpg|thumb|00000000050px|right|Forest ecologists are interested in the effects of large disturbances, such as [[wildfire]]s. [[Montana]], United States.]]\n\nForests accumulate large amounts of standing biomass, and many are capable of accumulating it at high rates, i.e. they are highly productive. Such high levels of biomass and tall vertical structures represent large stores of [[potential energy]] that can be converted to [[kinetic energy]] under the right circumstances. Two such conversions of great importance are [[wildfires|fires]] and [[windthrow|treefall]]s, both of which radically alter the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] and the physical environment where they occur. Also, in forests of high productivity, the rapid growth of the trees themselves induces biotic and environmental changes, although at a slower rate and lower intensity than relatively instantaneous [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] such as fires.\n\nWoody material, often referred to as [[coarse woody debris]], [[decomposition|decay]]s relatively slowly in many forests in comparison to most other [[organic matter|organic]] materials, due to a combination of environmental factors and wood chemistry (see [[lignin]]). Trees growing in [[arid]] and/or cold environments do so especially slowly. Thus, tree trunks and branches can remain on the forest floor for long periods, affecting such things as wildlife [[habitat]], fire behavior, and tree [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] processes.\n\nSome trees leave behind eerie skeletons after death. In reality these deaths are actually very few compared to the amount of tree deaths that go unnoticed. Thousands of seedlings can be produced from a single tree but only a few can actually grow to maturity. Most of those deaths are caused from competition for light, water, or soil nutrients, this is called natural thinning. Singular deaths caused by natural thinning go unnoticed, but many deaths can help form forest ecosystems. There are four stages to forest regrowth after a disturbance, the establishment phase which is rapid increase in seedlings, the thinning phase which happens after a canopy is formed and the seedlings covered by it die, the transition phase which occurs when one tree from the canopy dies and creates a pocket of light giving new seedlings opportunity to grow, and lastly the steady-state phase which happens when the forest has different sizes and ages of trees.\n\nLastly, forest trees store large amounts of water because of their large size and anatomical/physiological characteristics. They are therefore important regulators of hydrological processes, especially those involving groundwater [[hydrology]] and local evaporation and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall/snowfall]] patterns. Thus, forest ecological studies are sometimes closely aligned with [[meteorology|meteorological]] and hydrological studies in regional ecosystem or resource planning studies. Perhaps more importantly the duff or leaf litter can form a major repository of water storage. When this litter is removed or compacted ( through grazing or human overuse), erosion and flooding are exacerbated as well as deprivation of dry season water for forest organisms.\n\nThe ecological potential of a particular species is a measure of its capacity to effectively compete in a given geographical area, ahead of other species, as they all try to occupy a natural space. For some areas it has been quantified, as for instance by Hans-Jürgen Otto, for central Europe. He takes three groups of parameters:\n\nEvery parameter is scored between 0 and 5 for each considered species, and then a global mean value calculated. A value above 3.5 is considered high, below 3.0 low, and intermediate for those in between. In this study \"[[Fagus sylvatica]]\" has a score of 3.82, \"[[Fraxinus excelsior]]\" 3.08 and \"[[Juglans regia]]\" 2.92; and are examples of the three categories.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Forest ecology| ]]\n[[Category:Subfields of ecology]]"}

It is set during the Vietnam War in 1967.\n\nThe expansion pack \"\" was released in 2004 and was bundled with \"Vietcong\" as \"Vietcong: Purple Haze\" for the PC. \"Vietcong: Purple Haze\" was also released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, ported by Coyote Games. Another official add-on titled \"Red Dawn\" was released as a free downloadable content. A sequel to the game, \"Vietcong 2\", was released in 2005.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Sergeant First Class Steve R. Hawkins, assigned to the United States Special Forces (\"Green Berets\") camp at a strategic location of Nui Pek in South Vietnam near the Cambodian border. Hawkins and his A-Team carry out a series of various missions against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces. The game ends in a massive North Vietnamese attack on the team's base camp which is ultimately abandoned by all American forces.\n\nThe ground assault on Nui Pek is a recreation of the ground assault that happened at Special Forces Camp Lang Vei.\n\n\"Vietcong\" has the player take part in military operations against the Viet Cong and later also the North Vietnamese Army. Some levels are highly linear, while others take place in more open outdoor environments, allowing for more tactical freedom. Missions typically require the player to sabotage weapons caches or simply clear areas of enemies - usually not all objectives need to be achieved in order to complete a mission. Gameplay mostly revolves around open combat in the jungle, tunnels and other locations typical for the setting but the player occasionally also has to traverse longer passages without encountering enemies during which punji pits and other traps pose the main threat.\n\n\"Vietcong\" aims for a high level of authenticity and realism. AI characters make frequent use of cover but change the latter often, making it difficult for the player to anticipate enemies' specific locations and encouraging a tactical approach. All weapons' aim sights can be used to increase aim but a sway is present which simulates a shooter's shaking hands. The latter can be reduced by entering a crouching or prone stance. While aiming the gun is raised, which allows the player to shoot over cover without fully exposing himself. The game avoids the use of health packs and rather has the player use bandages, which briefly exposes him, or have a medic treat his wounds. The game features a variety of authentic weapons from the era such as the M-16 and AK-47 assault rifles. The player is able to choose the weapons he wants to go on a mission with in advance but can also replace them with weapons found on missions, giving him access to weapons used by the enemies. In some missions airstrikes can be ordered to bombard specific areas of the map.\n\nTypically for tactical shooters the player is usually accompanied by AI controlled comrades. Each of the fellow soldiers is a unique character who is not allowed to die and serves a specific role in the team. For instance the point man can safely lead the team towards the objective, avoiding any traps and warning the player of enemies in advance, while a combat engineer carries an infinite supply of ammo for the player. By default the team simply follows the player character and engages at will but general orders such as to attack the enemy or retreat can be given. The fellow soldiers can also be called individually to the player character's location.\n\nIn addition to the main campaign a \"quick fight\" mode is available. The latter allows the player to simply engage in a fight on one of several arena-like maps with the sole objective of eliminating all enemies. The player can choose whether he wishes to be accompanied by a team, how many and what kind of enemies to engage, and what equipment he wishes to go on the mission with. In this mode the player is also able to assume the role of a Viet Cong combatant and engage American soldiers. By default only a single map and few weapons are available but more become available as the player makes progress in the game's main campaign.\n\nThe game also features a local and online multiplayer mode which supports up to 64 players per match. The online lobby servers were hosted by the now-defunct GameSpy Arcade.\n\nSeveral gameplay modes typical for shooter games are available: Free for all deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag and last man standing. Additionally a team mode is available where, similarly to Counter-Strike, players remain dead for the remainder of the current round and teams only score a point if the opposite team has been completely annihilated.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Vietcong\" sold roughly 20,000 units during the first half of 2003. Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that these were \"not figures that spell H.I.T.\" Its sales in the region rose to around 50,000 units by year's end. As of November 2007, \"Vietcong\" had sold more than 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the game's country of origin, the game is highly popular. \"Vietcong\" was voted the 3rd best video game developed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in a survey by Czech web provider BonusWeb when it received 1393 votes out of 13,143 as every reader could choose for three games to vote for.\n\nGameSpot gave it the award of the Game of the Month for April 2003.\n\n\"Vietcong\" was named the eighth-best computer game of 2003 by \"Computer Games Magazine\". The editors wrote that \"the interface feels more like shooting a gun and interacting with the environment than any other first-person shooter ever\".\n\n"}

The Conservatory is a program of the American Film Institute founded in 1969.\n\nThe Center for Advanced Film Studies (later the AFI Conservatory) opened its doors at Greystone Mansion on September 23, 1969. Harold Lloyd screened his film The Freshman and spoke with AFI Fellows on the school's very first day. The first class included Terrence Malick, Caleb Deschanel and Paul Schrader.\n\nIn 1975, filmmaker Ján Kadár, director of the Oscar-winning film \"The Shop on Main Street\", became the Conservatory's first filmmaker-in-residence.\n\nIn 2013, Emmy and Oscar-winning director, producer and screenwriter James L. Brooks (\"As Good as It Gets\", \"Broadcast News\", \"Terms of Endearment\") joined the AFI Conservatory as Artistic Director, where he provides leadership for the film program. Brooks' artistic role at the AFI Conservatory has a rich legacy that includes Daniel Petrie, Jr., Robert Wise and Frank Pierson. Award-winning director Robert Mandel served as Dean of the AFI Conservatory for nine years. Jan Schuette took over as Dean in 2014 and served until 2017. Film Producer Richard Gladstein became Dean in May 2017. Michael Chung & Tom Engfer became Co-Interim Deans in November 2018.\n\nAmong those AFI has bestowed Honorary Degrees upon during its annual Commencement ceremony are Maya Angelou, John Williams, Ken Burns, Sherry Lansing, Sydney Pollack, Clint Eastwood, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Spike Lee, Rita Moreno and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThirteen AFI Conservatory thesis films have been nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nIn 2011, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked it the #1 film school in the world.\n\nIt is ranked in the top five graduate film programs along with USC, UCLA, NYU and California Institute of the Arts by the \"Princeton Review\" and \"US News and World Report\"\n\nAFI Conservatory is a five-term Master of Fine Arts program in six disciplines: Cinematography, Directing, Editing, Producing, Production Design, and Screenwriting. Traditionally, the Conservatory accepts 28 Fellows per year for most disciplines and 14 for the Production Design and Editing disciplines. Each discipline's program runs two years in length.\n\nFirst Year - Fellows from all disciplines work on at least three digital video or high definition short films (up to 20 minutes), referred to as 'cycle projects'. Each of these first-year projects are accomplished by Fellows with a minimum of oversight from the senior faculty. The purported goal being to stimulate a flexible and creative approach to filmmaking within imposed budgetary constraints and without the crutch of seasoned oversight. These 'cycle projects' make up the core curriculum of the first year experience and amount to a 'boot camp\" of filmmaking that simultaneously challenges and invigorates the Fellows involved.\n\nSecond Year - Most Fellows work on at least one thesis short film, shot on digital video, high definition, 35mm film, or 16mm film, and develop portfolio materials (such as a reel and a feature film screenplay). Screenwriting Fellows have the option of writing two feature-length screenplays instead of participating in a thesis film. They are responsible for raising the bulk of their own financing for these projects (average budget is $30,000), and must adhere to standard industry regulations, such as SAG charter rules, during filming. The senior faculty of the conservatory oversee the development of the 'second year' projects and monitor their development in a manner similar to what might be expected of an Executive Producer.\n\nCinematography - Encompassing training from pre-visualization to advanced image manipulation and\ncontrol, Cinematography Fellows develop their storytelling skills using formats ranging from digital\nvideo to 16mm and 35mm film cameras to the most cutting-edge cameras on the market.\n\nDirecting - With a focus on narrative filmmaking, Directing Fellows learn diverse directing\nstyles, techniques and strategies as they gain a thorough understanding of the\nproduction process, script to screen.\n\nEditing - Editing Fellows master the skills to be editors, assistant editors and post-production producers\nwhile learning the technical, aesthetic and collaborative aspects of post-production\nwith a primary focus on storytelling.\n\nProducing - Producing Fellows study all aspects of creative, entrepreneurial production while\ndeveloping and producing a minimum of three short films in their first year\nand a thesis film in their second year.\n\nProduction Design - Attracting artists from architecture, interior design, theater design and other\nrelated fields, the Production Design curriculum focuses on the creative process\nof visually and physically developing cinematic environments.\n\nScreenwriting - Screenwriting Fellows conceive and write multiple projects in features, short films, long\nand short-form TV drama and comedy as well as webisodes and other Internet\ninnovations.

She was Abu Lahab's wife and Abu Sufyan's sister. Arwa is usually remembered for opposing Islam and the prophet, and also for a poem.\n\nShe was the daughter of Harb ibn Umayya, a chief of Mecca. She was a sister of Abu Sufyan and one of the leading women of the Quraysh.\n\nShe married Abū Lahab, a paternal uncle of Muhammad. They had at least six children: Utbah, Utaybah,<ref name=\"Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 170\">Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 170.</ref> Muattab, Durrah (Fakhita), 'Uzzā and Khālida. It is not clear whether she was also the mother of Abu Lahab's son Durrah.\n\nUmm Jamil supported her husband in his opposition to Muhammad's preaching. When Muhammad promised Paradise to the believers, Abu Lahab blew on his hands and said, \"May you perish. I can see nothing in you of the things that Muhammad says.\" Muhammad therefore declared a revelation from Allah about them.\n\n<poem>\"May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.\"\n\"His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained.\"\n\"He will burn in a Fire of flame\"\n\"And his wife – the carrier of firewood.\"\n\"Around her neck is a rope of fibre.\"</poem>\n\nThe occasion for this revelation is disputed. Ibn Sa'd and Ibn Kathir state that it was in 613 CE, when Muhammad summoned the Quraysh to Mount Safa for his first public warning that they must heed Allah's message. Abu Lahab interrupted: \"May you perish! Did you assemble us for this? You should die!\" and Muhammad responded with the prophecy.\nIbn Ishaq implies that it occurred in 616, when Abu Lahab left the Hashim clan and refused to protect Muhammad.\n\nIbn Ishaq says that Umm Jamil was called \"the carrier of firewood\" because she carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's way where he would be passing; however, he also states that the Quraysh did not resort to this form of harassment until after the death of Abu Talib in 620. Ibn Kathir also offers the alternative theory that \"carrier of firewood\" does not refer to a past event but to Umm Jamil's future destiny of willingly stoking the fires that would punish her husband in Hell.\n\nWhen Umm Jamil bint Harb heard that Muhammad had been prophesying about her and her husband, she went to the Kaaba, where Muhammad was sitting with Abu Bakr, carrying a stone pestle. She did not notice Muhammad, so she asked Abu Bakr after him, \"for I have been told that he is satirising me. If I had found him, I would have smashed his mouth with this stone.\" Then she produced a poem of her own:\n\n<poem>\"We reject the reprobate,\"\n\"His words we repudiate,\"\n\"His religion we loathe and hate.\"</poem>\n\nShe departed, still not having noticed Muhammad.\n"}
