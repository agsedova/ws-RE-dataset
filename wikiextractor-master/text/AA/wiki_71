{"id": "1876457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876457", "title": "Luigi Tenco", "text": "Luigi Tenco\n\nLuigi Tenco (21 March 1938 – 27 January 1967) was an Italian singer, songwriter. After his alleged suicide, he became an icon of love and despair. The true causes of his death have not yet been agreed upon.\n\nTenco was born in Cassine (province of Alessandria) in 1938, the son of Teresa Zoccola and Giuseppe Tenco. He never knew his father, who died in unclear circumstances. It has been rumored that Luigi Tenco was the fruit of an extramarital relationship of his mother.\n\nTenco spent his childhood in Cassine and Ricaldone until 1948, when he moved to Liguria, first to Nervi and then to Genoa, where his mother had a wine shop called \"Enos\" in the quarter of La Foce. During high school, Tenco founded the Jelly Roll Morton Boys Jazz band, in which Tenco played the clarinet and another singer, later to become famous, Bruno Lauzi, the banjo. Gino Paoli, that soon will be one of Italy's most famous singer and songwriter as well, also played with Tenco in the band he was later involved in, \"I Diavoli del Rock\" (The Rock Devils).\n\nTenco made his debut in the world of Italian professional music with the band I Cavalieri (The Knights), which included Giampiero Reverberi and Enzo Jannacci amongst others. During this period he used the pseudonym Gigi Mai. In 1961 Tenco released his first single under his real name, entitled \"Quando\" (\"When\"). \n\nHe started university studying electronic engineering, trying to comply with the wish of his mother and brother. He failed twice the Analytic and Projective Geometry exam (a course he took with professor Eugenio Giuseppe Togliatti, the elder brother of the leader of the communist party Palmiro Togliatti). Later he was enrolled in political science, where he only gave two exams. \n\nTenco was interested in cinema and videomaking. In 1962 he began a short-lived cinematic experience, with Luciano Salce's movie \"La Cuccagna\". He also collaborated to the soundtrack of the film, also introducing his friend Fabrizio De André (unknown at the time) through the song \"La ballata dell'eroe\" (\"Ballad for a hero\"). In first instance, director Luigi Comencini considered the possibility of Tenco playing the role of Bube in his film La ragazza di Bube based on Carlo Cassola's novel. At last, he chose George Chakiris, the West Side Story star, instead. During this period he also formed a strong friendship with the Genoese anarchist poet Riccardo Mannerini. In 1963, however, his friendship with Gino Paoli broke up, due to a troubled relationship with the actress Stefania Sandrelli.\n\nTenco's first LP was released in 1962, \"Ballate E Canzoni\". One of the songs, \"Cara Maestra\" (\"Dear Teacher\"), was censored by the then thriving Italian media censorship. The censors struck again in the following year, against his songs \"Io Sì\" (\"I Would\") considered too sexually explicit and \"Una Brava Ragazza\" (\"A Good Girl\") where Tenco express his admiration for a '60s \"bad girl\". In September 1964, he released \"Ho capito che ti amo\" a song written by him with musical arrangement Ezio Leoni. It was released on the Italian record label Jolly as Side A of a 45 rpm side B being \"Io lo so già\". In Argentina, \"Ho capito che ti amo\" was the soundtrack of popular soap opera El amor tiene cara de mujer.\n\nIn 1966, suffering through a period of compulsory military service, he released \"Un Giorno Dopo L'Altro\" (\"One Day after Another\") for RCA. The military service didn't stop him from traveling to Argentina together with Gianfranco Reverberi to meet the fans of \"El amor tiene cara de mujer\". How he actually managed to arrive to Argentina while his passport was still in possession of the Italian Army is still unclear. Moreover under the military service one wasn't allowed to leave Italy and the punishment was detention, which he didn't experiment according to what's written on his service record book. \n\nIn Rome during the same year, he met and befriended the Egypt-Italo-French singer Dalida. The two were eventually to become lovers.\n\nIn 1967 he took part in the Italian Song Festival in Sanremo. It was rumored, that he participated against his will. The song he presented was \"Ciao Amore Ciao\" (\"Bye, Bye my Love\"), which he sang together with Dalida. The video of the performance is lost, however it's possible to listen to the audio track, taken from the radio. Tenco allegedly committed suicide on 27 January 1967, he was only 28 years old, after learning that his song had been eliminated from the final competition. Tenco was officially found by Dalida in his hotel room with a bullet wound in his left temple and a note: \"I cared for the Italian public and I dedicated in vain five years of my life to them. I'm doing this not because I'm tired of life (I'm not) but as a gesture of dissent against the public who chose \"Io tu e le rose\" for the final night and against the commission that selected \"La rivoluzione\". I hope this will clear somebody's head\". On that morning Tenco and Dalida had privately announced their wedding to music producer Paolo Dossena.\n\nTenco was buried in Ricaldone. In 1974 the Tenco Award was instituted, and has been held every year since in Sanremo. Many of the most renowned Italian singer-songwriters from the 1970s declared explicitly the influence of Tenco on their work. Francesco De Gregori's album \"Bufalo Bill\" of 1976 contained a song, \"Festival\", about Tenco's suicide; it points out the hypocrisy with which the music establishment tried to minimize the dramatic event, in order to let the show go on.\n\nIn 2004 on TV program \"Domenica In\", the detective who followed the inquiry, commissario Arrigo Molinari, when asked by host Paolo Bonolis, stated that he was sure that Tenco didn't commit suicide and he defined his death: \"a collective murder\". He also justified his own faults concerning the Tenco inquiry by declaring that he has been prevented to investigate properly. Shortly after the quoted interview, Molinari died, killed by a thief. \n\nIn 2005 The French television channel TV5 carried a full-length dramatization of the love affair of Tenco and Dalida. Tenco was played by Alessandro Gassman, while Dalida was played by Sabrina Ferilli. Notwithstanding the account of Tenco and Dalida love story on which the dramatization is based, at the beginning of the '90s Tenco's older brother Valentino met a woman, Valeria, who had in her possession several letters written by Tenco himself that would testify their love relationship started in 1964 and lasted until his death. In one of this letter, Tenco writes that his relationship with Dalida was nothing but a clumsy attempt to forget Valeria that, months before, had left him. He describes Dalida as a woman :\"spoiled, neurotic, ignorant, who rejects the idea of being defeated in her profession as in private life\". Valentino Tenco identified those letters as written by his brother. \n\nThe Italian judicial system later began re-examining Luigi Tenco's suicide. It was pointed out, that the bullet hole was on the left temple, while the singer was right-handed. It had also been revealed that no autopsy had been done on the singer's corpse, no paraffine test, and no calligraphic analysis on the suicide note with which he explained his final gesture.\n\nOn 15 February 2006, Italian police exhumed Tenco's body for further investigation. The next day, results from the new autopsy and ballistics analysis were reported. According to Italian experts, what had been thought to be the entry hole on the left temple was actually the exit site. The bullet trajectory\nwas said to be compatible with suicide. \n\nNevertheless, criminologists Pasquale Ragone and Nicola Guarneri, in their book \"Le ombre del silenzio\" (\"The shadows of silence\", 2013) pointed out the several incongruences between the shell case of the bullet found in Tenco's room and the bullet Tenco's Walter PPK gun would eject. Professor of ballistic forensics Martino Farneti proved that they don't match. As there's no proof nor official statement that declares that Tenco's Walter PPK was actually present in his room the night he died (from the police registers it results that the gun was actually found in his car) Guarneri and Ragone assume that Tenco might have been killed. The actual weapon might have been a Beretta 70, as on this type of gun (similar to Walter PPK) it's possible to put a silencer. In fact, the night Tenco died (allegedly in his hotel room) no one heard the sound of the gun shooting, not even singer Lucio Dalla, whose room was next to Tenco's, nor did journalist Sandro Ciotti, whose room was in front of Tenco's.\n\nMusic producer and friend Paolo Dossena stated that he drove Tenco's car from Rome (where the songwriter lived) to Sanremo and on the way, passing through a roadblock on the Aurelia, he discovered that Tenco had his Walter PPK in the dashboard of his car. He later confronted the songwriter who confessed that he took a gun because someone in the past few weeks had tried to drop him down a steep road near Santa Margherita ligure while he was driving.\n\nThe first witnesses who entered the room didn't even see the suicide note. It was journalist Piero Vivarelli that delivered the note to the police after having spent a few minutes in Dalida's room. Guarneri and Ragone assume that the alleged suicide note might have been in fact the last page of a document written by Tenco for a different aim. \n\nFrench journalist and novelist Philippe Brunel wrote a fiction book, La nuit de San Remo, in which he dramatizes the arduous search for truth about Tenco's death.\n\nShortly after his death, his friend and songwriter Fabrizio De André wrote for him the song \"Preghiera in gennaio\" (A prayer in January) where he describes a benevolent God welcoming those who committed suicide in Heaven, in spite of the moral condemnation of the bigots. \n\nIn 1999, the play \"Solitudini – Luigi Tenco e Dalida\", written and directed by Maurizio Valtieri, was performed in Rome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1876458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876458", "title": "Next-generation network", "text": "Next-generation network\n\nThe next-generation network (NGN) is a body of key architectural changes in telecommunication core and access networks. The general idea behind the NGN is that one network transports all information and services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly telephone-centric networks toward NGN.\n\nNGN is a different concept from Future Internet, which is more focused on the evolution of Internet in terms of the variety and interactions of services offered.\n\nAccording to ITU-T, the definition is:\n\nFrom a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural changes that need to be looked at separately:\n\n\nIn an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport (connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the service layer without considering the transport layer – i.e. services are independent of transport details. Increasingly applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box).\n\nNext-generation networks are based on Internet technologies including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323.\n\nInitially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity decreased in the \"local loop\" due to its original poor traversal of network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core backbones. With the most recent changes introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless, most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being the most widely adopted protocol.\n\nFor voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a Softswitch – a programmable device that controls Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN, through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions.\n\nOne may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN, SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media Gateway Controller (MGC).\n\nA Call Agent is a general name for devices/systems controlling calls.\n\nThe IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised NGN architecture for an Internet media-services capability defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).\n\nIn the UK another popular acronym was introduced by BT (British Telecom) as 21CN (21st Century Networks, sometimes mistakenly quoted as C21N) — this is another loose term for NGN and denotes BT's initiative to deploy and operate NGN switches and networks in the period 2006–2008 (the aim being by 2008 BT to have only all-IP switches in their network). The concept was abandoned, however, in favor of maintaining current-generation equipment.\n\nThe first company in the UK to roll out a NGN was THUS plc which started deployment back in 1999. THUS' NGN contains 10,600 km of fibre optic cable with more than 190 points of presence throughout the UK. The core optical network uses dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) technology to provide scalability to many hundreds of gigabits per second of bandwidth, in line with growth demand. On top of this, the THUS backbone network uses MPLS technology to deliver the highest possible performance. IP/MPLS-based services carry voice, video and data traffic across a converged infrastructure, potentially allowing organisations to enjoy lower infrastructure costs, as well as added flexibility and functionality. Traffic can be prioritised with Classes of Service, coupled with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that underpin quality of service performance guarantees. The THUS NGN accommodates seven Classes of Service, four of which are currently offered on MPLS IP VPN.\n\nIn the Netherlands, KPN is developing an NGN in a network transformation program called all-IP. Next Generation Networks also extends into the messaging domain and in Ireland, Openmind Networks has designed, built and deployed Traffic Control to handle the demands and requirements of all IP networks.\n\nIn Bulgaria, BTC (Bulgarian Telecommunications Company) has implemented the NGN as underlying network of its telco services on a large-scale project in 2004. The inherent flexibility and scalability of the new core network approach resulted in an unprecedented rise of classical services deployment as POTS/ISDN, Centrex, ADSL, VPN, as well as implementation of higher bandwidths for the Metro and Long-distance Ethernet / VPN services, cross-national transits and WebTV/IPTV application.\n\nIn February 2014 Deutsche Telekom revealed that its subsidiary Makedonski Telekom had become the first European incumbent to convert its PSTN infrastructure to an all IP network. It took just over two years for all 290,000 fixed lines to be migrated onto the new platform. The capital investment worth 14 million euros makes Macedonia the first country in the South-East Europe whose network will be fully based on Internet protocol.\n\nIn Canada, startup Wind Mobile owned by Globalive is deploying an all-ip wireless backbone for its mobile phone service.\n\nIn mid 2005, China Telecom announced its commercial roll-out of China Telecom's Next Generation Carrying Network, or CN2, using Internet Protocol Next-Generation Network (IP NGN) architecture. It's IPv6-capable backbone network leverages softswitches (the control layer) and protocols like DiffServ and MPLS, which boosts performance of its bearer layer. The MPLS-optimized architecture also enables Frame Relay and ATM traffic to be transported over a Layer 2 VPN, which supports both legacy traffic and new IP services over a single IP/MPLS network.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1876478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876478", "title": "Transportation in Portland, Oregon", "text": "Transportation in Portland, Oregon\n\nLike transportation in the rest of the United States, the primary mode of local transportation in Portland, Oregon is the automobile. Metro, the metropolitan area's regional government, has a regional master plan in which transit-oriented development plays a major role. This approach, part of the new urbanism, promotes mixed-use and high-density development around light rail stops and transit centers, and the investment of the metropolitan area's share of federal tax dollars into multiple modes of transportation. In the United States, this focus is atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities.\n\nPortland has a public transportation system. The bus and rail system is operated by TriMet, its name reflecting the three metropolitan area counties it serves (Multnomah, Clackamas, and Washington). Portland's rate of public transit use (12.6% of commutes in 2008) is comparable to much larger cities like Los Angeles, and higher than in most similarly sized U.S. cities, but is lower than in some others, such as Baltimore and Seattle. Transit service between Portland and Vancouver, Washington, the second-largest city in the metropolitan area, is provided by C-Tran, with a small number of express routes.\nWithin the downtown area (the city center) is the Portland Transit Mall, a transit-priority corridor on which buses and light rail trains from many different parts of the region converge. First opened in 1977, and for three decades served only by buses, the transit mall underwent major changes in 2009. Tracks for light rail (MAX) were added, bus stops spaced farther apart, and the left lane opened to general traffic (but with right turns prohibited). To facilitate this major renovation and rebuilding, lasting more than two years, all bus routes using the mall were diverted to other streets (mainly 3rd and 4th avenues) starting in January 2007. The transit mall reopened to buses on May 24, 2009, and operator training runs on the new light-rail tracks took place during the late spring and summer. Light rail service on the transit mall was introduced on August 30, 2009, when the MAX Yellow Line moved to the mall from its previous routing. The new MAX Green Line opened 13 days later, on September 12, and it also serves the downtown transit mall.\n\nFrom 1975 to 2010, all of downtown Portland was in Fareless Square, a fare zone within which all rides on buses, light rail and streetcars were fare-free, and starting in 2001 this zone also covered a portion of the adjacent Lloyd District. In 2010, free rides became limited to light-rail and streetcar service – no longer covering bus service – and the zone was renamed the \"Free Rail Zone\". In September 2012, the fareless zone was discontinued entirely, due to a $12 million shortfall in TriMet's annual budget.\n\nBen Holladay was the first person to offer public transportation to the city of Portland when in 1872 he opened the Portland Street Railway Company, a horsecar line on First Street extending to a garage at the end of Glisan. In 1882, a second horsecar system was built for Third Street. Ferries such as the O&CRR Ferry#2 were used to cross the Willamette River before the construction of the first Steel Bridge in 1888. At that point, rail expanded into Albina and East Portland. Horsecars took passengers across the river and steam trains took them further into the suburbs, but both modes were soon replaced by electric streetcar lines, the first of which began operation on November 1, 1889, between St. Johns and Portland.\n\nTriMet operates a fleet of 688 buses on a network of 79 bus routes. Twelve of the routes are designated \"Frequent Service\" bus routes, with more frequent schedules than other routes. Originally intended to have buses scheduled every 15 minutes or less all day, every day (including weekends and holidays), budget cutbacks in 2009 caused TriMet to change \"Frequent Service\" routes to have 15-minute-or-less wait times only during weekday peak usage times in the morning and afternoon. In August 2014, TriMet reintroduced 15-minutes-or-less wait times at all times during weekdays on Frequent Service routes, with the stated goal of reinstating weekend 15-minutes-or-less wait times on these routes.\n\nTriMet's bus fleet is made up of and buses, built in 2000 or later, and all are low-floor buses, the last of the high-floor models having been retired in 2016. The last non-air-conditioned buses were retired in December 2015. \n\nTriMet's bus routes also include express buses from downtown Portland to South Beaverton, Sherwood and Oregon City, and express buses from Marquam Hill to Beaverton, Tigard, Southwest Portland, and Milwaukie. TriMet also has several \"cross-town\" routes that do not serve downtown Portland. The bus network operates predominately in a hub-and-spoke network starting with the downtown Portland transit mall, and includes outlying transit centers in Portland's suburbs.\n\nIn addition to the fixed-route service, TriMet operates a paratransit service known as LIFT which operates 253 minibuses and 15 sedans offering door-to-door service for citizens who cannot access regular TriMet services.\n\nSince September 2015, Portland's light rail system, named \"MAX\" (short for Metropolitan Area Express), consists of five color-coded lines:\n\nThe Portland Streetcar is a two-line streetcar system serving the central part of Portland—downtown and the areas immediately surrounding downtown. The system's first line opened in 2001 and, with later extensions, now follows a route from Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center at NW 23rd Avenue through inner-Northwest and Southwest, including the Pearl District and Portland State University, to the new South Waterfront neighborhood, where it connects to the Portland Aerial Tram. In 2012, this route was given the designation North-South Line, or NS Line.\n\nThe system's second line opened in 2012 and extended service across the Willamette River to the Lloyd District and the Central Eastside. The federal share of funding for this $148-million project, a extension and fleet expansion, was approved in April 2009, and construction began in August 2009. Originally named the Central Loop Line, or CL Line, it was renamed the A Loop (clockwise) and B Loop (counterclockwise) in 2015, when it was extended from the eastside across the Tilikum Crossing bridge and also along the NS Line from South Waterfront to Portland State University. See Portland Streetcar (Eastside line) and Loop Service (Portland Streetcar) for more detail.\n\nThe Willamette Shore Trolley is a seasonal, volunteer-operated heritage streetcar service established in 1990 – after a 1987 trial run – for the purpose of preserving an approximately former Southern Pacific railroad right-of-way running south from Portland to Lake Oswego for possible future transit use. Plans to extend the Portland Streetcar along the right-of-way were mothballed in early 2012, but remain under consideration for the long term. The right-of-way was acquired by a consortium of local governmental entities in 1988 for this purpose.\n\nTriMet's WES Commuter Rail connects the cities of Wilsonville, Tualatin, Tigard and Beaverton. It is one of only two suburb-to-suburb commuter rail lines in the country, along with Tri-Rail in Miami. Rather than electric railcars like those of MAX, the line uses FRA-compliant diesel multiple units running on existing Portland and Western Railroad freight tracks. The first rides open to the general public took place on Friday, January 30, 2009, and regular service began on Monday, February 2, 2009.\n\nAmtrak also exists as a rail commuting option in the Portland area with the Amtrak Cascades providing daily service between Portland and neighboring Oregon City. While the frequency is less than that of TriMet, the 20-minute ride from Oregon City is faster, has cheaper tickets, and is arguably a more comfortable service.\n\nSee the Intercity service section below for information about the many intercity bus and train services to and from Portland from outside the metro area.\n\nThe Portland Aerial Tram is an aerial cableway used to connect the South Waterfront district with Oregon Health and Science University on Marquam Hill above. The cableway is two-thirds of one mile (1 km) long and was opened to the public in January 2007.\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Portland, OR, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 90 min. 36% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 21% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.2 km, while 18% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. \n\nBicycle use in Portland has been growing rapidly, having nearly tripled since 2001; for example, daily bicycle traffic on four of the Willamette River bridges has increased from 2,855 before 1992 to over 16,000 in , partly due to improved facilities. Approximately 8% of commuters bike to work in Portland, the highest proportion of any major U.S. city and about 10 times the national average. In July 2016, Portland introduce a bike share program known as Biketown, initially running with 1,000 bikes. The bikes were provided by Social Bicycles, and the program is operated by Motivate.\n\nAccording to a city video, in 1994 Portland became the first city to develop a pedestrian master plan. Blocks in the downtown area are only long. Many streets in the outer southwest section of the city lack sidewalks; however, this is partially made up with various off-street trails. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Portland the 12th most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States.\n\nThe Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, a new pedestrian and bicycle bridge over I-5 near the Portland Aerial Tram, opened in 2012.\n\nElectric scooter sharing systems have become popular in the past few years as an alternative form of transportation. They first came to Portland in July of 2018 where they when they were approved for a four month pilot program. Scooters returned to Portland in April 2019 for a year long program after positive review by the city of the first program. The system works much like most bike share systems which have also become popular in Portland and around the world. Users unlock and pay for a scooter with an app on their smartphone and then can drop it off anywhere when done with it. \nThere were many complaints about the effectiveness and safety of the program when the program first returned to Portland. A report done by the city shows that over 700,000 rides were taken during the pilot program and that scooters are equally dangerous to other transportation systems but that many riders did not follow the safety regulations such as wearing a helmet. However despite this there are still a lot of concerns.\nIn response to some of the backlash around safety Portland has instituted specific laws that apply to scooters, these are all riders must wear a helmet, you must be 16 or older to ride, no riding on the sidewalk, no riding in city parks, and yield to pedestrians. \nIn addition to some of the safety concerns there were also concerns about access both for low income residents and residents with mobility issues. The city has responded to both of these and each scooter company now has discounted rates for low income residents. These rates differ significantly by company with some being a small discount and others being up to 50 free rides of 30 minutes or less a month. All companies also offer options for non-smartphone users although most of these still require being able to receive SMS texts. The city has passed codes that outlaw leaving the scooters in the middle of sidewalks in response to complaints about the scooters but it is unclear how often that is being enforced. \nDespite all of these measures taken by the City of Portland as well as the individual companies there is still much concern and controversy around the scooters. Many are still concerned about inclusivity and disability access as well safety as all complaints about riders leaving or riding the scooters on the sidewalk and not wearing helmets will be dealt with by the private companies not the city itself. There are also concerns about access to the scooters in all parts of Portland particularly the low income neighborhoods as most of the scooters have been centered in downtown and other wealthier and popular tourist parts of the city. \nAs the program is still new there is a lack of data about whether or not this program is decreasing the reliance on cars and providing alternative forms of transportation in the city as its original goal. According to a report done by the city 34% of local riders used the scooters instead of driving and 48% of visitors used the scooters rather than driving or using a rideshare system. It is unclear whether these numbers have increased or decreased with the new year-long program and as with other new technologies there are still many concerns surrounding the scooters. \nIn June of 2019 more than 50 scooters from various companies were pulled out of the Willamette River in Portland by a dive team from the Multnomah County Sheriff’s office. It is unclear who put them there or why and it is unclear how long they were there before being spotted by the divers. \n\nMany streets in Portland are one-way; streets in downtown Portland (Southwest Portland bounded by I-405 and the Willamette River) are virtually all one-way, forming a grid of alternating street traffic: for north-south streets, odd-numbered avenues (1st, 3rd, etc.) are southbound, while even-numbered avenues (2nd, 4th, etc.) are northbound, and similarly east-west streets alternate. This is partly due to the streets in downtown Portland being relatively narrow (). This grid extends a short way west across I-405 into Goose Hollow, terminating at SW 18th Avenue, and extends to some degree north across Burnside Street into the Pearl District, particularly with the north-south streets extending into Old Town.\n\nMost streets on the east side are two-way, but there are a number of one-way pairs along major routes: Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (MLK)/Grand Avenue (the equivalent of 4th and 5th avenues), and 11th/12th east-west pairs are connected with bridges, with NE Couch/Burnside forming a pair east of the Burnside Bridge from 3rd to 14th avenues, SE Morrison/SE Belmont forming a pair from the Morrison Bridge to SE 25th Ave, and SE Madison/SE Hawthorne forming a pair from the Hawthorne Bridge to SE 12th Avenue.\n\nState highways, numbered as Interstate, U.S and Oregon Routes, in the metropolitan area include:\n\nNotable highways never built, or removed altogether, include Mount Hood Freeway, Interstate 505, and Harbor Drive.\n\nThe large number of bridges in Portland has given the city its \"Bridgetown\" nickname.\n\nBridges over the Willamette River, listed north to south:\n\nBridges over the Columbia River, listed west to east:\n\nLong-distance passenger rail service to Portland is provided by Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, with trains stopping at Union Station. Amtrak routes serving Portland include the Amtrak Cascades (with service to/from Vancouver, British Columbia and Eugene, Oregon), the Coast Starlight (with service to/from Los Angeles and Seattle) and the Empire Builder (with service to/from Portland and Chicago).\n\nWhile long-distance rail options are somewhat limited and infrequent, Oregon has a well-connected intercity bus network offering numerous options for travel to and from the Portland metro area. The Cascades POINT provides daily service between Portland and Eugene, with stops at every Amtrak station in the Willamette Valley.

The style stood in strong contrast to the French styles affected by many of the Spanish elite under the influence of the Enlightenment. \"Majos\" were known to pick fights with those they saw as \"afrancesados\" (\"Frenchified\" – fops).\n\nIn Spanish, the word possesses derived forms such as \"chulapo\" and \"chulapa\", a version of \"chulo\" and \"chula\" in reference to their saucy attitude, as well as \"chispero\" and \"chispera\", among others.\n\nAlthough \"majos\" of both sexes were frequent subjects of painter Francisco Goya, two of his \"majas\", \"La maja vestida\" and \"La maja desnuda\" (the same model, naked), would gain international renown. \n\nThe outfit of the \"maja\" would influence the costume of the eponymous protagonist of Georges Bizet's French opera \"Carmen\" in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 20th century, with the popularization of Spain as a tourist destination, the \"manola\" or \"maja\", often holding a folding fan, increasingly gained recognition as the image of a stereotypical traditional Spanish woman. Thus the \"maja\" became one of the popular and informal symbols of Spain, along with the bullfighter, who took the place of the \"majo\". Some of the 20th-century depictions of the \"maja\" became somewhat assimilated to the flamenco dancer (\"la bailaora\"). Nowadays, the increasing popularity of the \"maja\" has ended up eclipsing that of the \"majo\".\n\nThe image of a \"maja\" was the trademark of the Jabón Maja Myrurgia soap, one of the classical souvenirs from Spain. The brand's portrait of the \"maja\" in the soap boxes and wrappings was based on the person of Carmen Tórtola Valencia (1882–1955), a famous Spanish dancer of the early 20th century.\n\n\n"}

It was dedicated to his wife Ekaterina Protopova. Some scholars, such as Borodin's biographer Serge Dianin, suggest that the quartet was a 20th anniversary gift and that it has a program evoking the couple's first meeting in Heidelberg. Of its four movements, the third movement \"\"Notturno\"\" is the most famous.\n\nBorodin wrote the string quartet quickly in 1881 while staying at the estate of his friend, the minor composer Nikolai Lodyzhensky, which was located in Zhitovo, southeast of Moscow. Borodin also composed the symphonic poem \"In the Steppes of Central Asia\" the same year. The quartet premiered in that year or the next. (The external links give a more complete tale but conflict on the date.)\n\nThe string quartet has four movements:\n\n\nThe first movement is written in sonata form. The principal theme of the exposition begins in measure one, with a cello singing a lyrical melody in high register.\n\nThe transition begins in measure 35, and quickly leads into the subordinate theme (measure 44) in A major, the dominant.\n\nThe subordinate theme has a complex structure, a three-part form of its own (a-b-a'), which leads into the closing theme in measure 86 (Animato), which concludes the exposition in measure 107. The development (beginning in measure 108) begins with the same material as the exposition, except the cello is in the low register, and the key is changed from D major to F major. After some contrapuntal work, the development reaches a dominant pedal point (measure 167), which resolves in the main key of the piece, D major, in the recapitulation in measure 180. The recapitulation follows the broad outlines of the exposition, except the subordinate theme (measure 224) begins in E-flat major instead of the customary D major. The three-part structure of the subordinate theme, though, allows Borodin to reach the expected D major in the a' part of the subordinate theme (measure 257), and the closing theme (measure 266) concludes the movement.\n\nThe first movement exemplifies Borodin's lyrical (as opposed to dramatic) treatment of the sonata form. All thematic material is lyrical; contrasts are achieved via contrapuntal writing (as in the middle section of the subordinate theme, beginning in measure 57, and especially in beginning in measure 65), or color contrasts (such as changes of keys–beginning of the development, and particularly the non-traditional key of the subordinate theme in the recapitulation).\n»\n</score>\n\nThe scherzo second movement is also in sonata form, rather than the ABA form that is more usual for scherzo-style movements. Of note is also the appearance of a scherzo as the second movement in a sonata cycle, rather than the more customary third movement. This is characteristic for Borodin, who used the same movement scheme (scherzo as a second movement) in his Second Symphony.\n\nThe principal theme of this movement (descending scale-based figure of the first violin, accompanied by a falling motive in a viola) reminds one of Mendelssohn's scherzi.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\version \"2.14.2\"\n\\relative c\" {\n\\key f \\major\n\\time 3/4\n\\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'()\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\tempo 4 = 240\nf8->( e d c d c)\nf->( e d c d c)\na'->( g f e f e)\na->( g f e f e)\nd'->( c) c( a f a)\nbes->( a) a( f d f)\na->( g) g( e c e)\nf->( d) c( d c d)\n</score>\nThe \"rising thirds\" motif of the subordinate theme (measure 29) is an inversion of the viola's accompanying falling motif.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\version \"2.14.2\"\n\\relative c' {\n\\key f \\major\n\\time 3/4\n\\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'()\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\tempo 4 = 160\n<f a>4( 2)\n<f a>4( 2)\n<g b>4( <c e>4.) <e, g>8(\n4 <g b>8 <g b> <f a>)\n</score>\nThe descending scale-based figure of the subordinate theme, repeated by viola starting with measure 51, recalls the principal theme. The movement's development begins at measure 100 and emphasizes counterpoint in combining the motives of the principal and subordinate themes (measure 144). The recapitulation (measure 192) brings the subordinate theme in the main key of F (measure 221), and, after a momentary burst of activity, the movement whispers away.\n\nThe tuneful subordinate theme of this movement was freely used in the musical \"Kismet\" as the song “Baubles, Bangles and Beads.” This musical received the 1954 Tony Award.\n\nThe main theme of the third movement is perhaps the most famous in the quartet. An agitated middle section, beginning in F major, followed by a series of modulations and lasting from bars 47–110 of the movement, interrupts this theme's otherwise peaceful mood. The main theme is restated after the middle section in canon (first cello and the first violin, then two violins).\n\nThe finale demonstrates Borodin's mastery of counterpoint. Written in a conventional sonata form, it opens with an introduction, which introduces the principal theme, broken into two elements: a dialogue between two violins, answered by a viola and cello. These \"question-answer\" motifs (one possibly being an imprecise retrograde inversion of another) combine into the principal theme of the movement (beginning with measure 20), where the \"answer\" makes an accompaniment, and the \"question\" makes for the upper voice. The principal theme is stated as a canon, with viola, second violin, and first violin stating the theme, which modulates into a dominant, and lead into the subordinate theme in measure 90. The subordinate theme retains the frantic pace of the principal theme, to be contrasted with a more relaxed closing theme, based on the motifs of the subordinate theme, at measure 177. The development starts similar to the exposition with the question-answer dialogue, except the question now is in lower strings, and the answer in violins. After much contrapuntal work (including a charming \"horse-riding\" episode worthy of Rossini, beginning in measure 296), the recapitulation begins with the now familiar question-answer motifs, this time enunciated by the combined strings (measure 371). The recapitulation proceeds as expected (with the subordinate theme in the tonic key, measure 459), only to be suddenly shifted into another key by the beginning of the coda (measure 588). But this modulation proves to be short-lived, and the coda quickly reaches the long-breathed D major close.\n\nThe Borodin Quartet in both its incarnations have specialized in this work, producing recordings of it.\n\nThe Emerson Quartet also produced a well-known recording in 1986.\n\nThe Escher String Quartet released a recording in 2018.\n\nMany parts of the piece were adapted into the 1953 Broadway musical \"Kismet\"\n\nThe third movement serves as the score to Disney's 2006 short \"The Little Matchgirl\".\n\nExcerpt of the piece played in the first episode of Star Trek: Discovery\n\n"}

{"id": "1876518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876518", "title": "Humboldt squid", "text": "Humboldt squid\n\nThe Humboldt squid (\"Dosidicus gigas\"), also known as jumbo squid, jumbo flying squid, pota, or \"diablo rojo\" (red devil), is a large, predatory squid living in the waters of the Humboldt Current in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is the only species of the genus \"Dosidicus\" of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, family Ommastrephidae.\n\nHumboldt squid typically reach a mantle length of . They have a reputation for aggression towards humans, though this behavior may possibly only be manifested during feeding times. Like other members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, they possess bioluminescent photophores and are capable of quickly changing body coloration (metachrosis). They notably rapidly flash red and white while hunting, earning them the name \"diablo rojo\" (Spanish for \"red devil\") among fishermen. These chromatophores (which belong to more than one set and are of different sizes) may rapidly cycle through colors other than red and white, flashing too quickly for the human eye to see the transitions. They have a relatively short lifespan of just 1-2 years.\n\nThey are most commonly found at depths of , from Tierra del Fuego to California. This species is spreading north into the waters of the Pacific Northwest, in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. They are fished commercially, predominantly in Mexico and Peru.\n\nThe genus contains bioluminescent species.\n\nSome squid may grow to in mantle length and weigh up to . Generally, the mantle (or body) constitutes about 40% of the animal's mass, the fins (or wings) about 12%, the arms and tentacles about 14%, the outer skin about 3%, the head (including eyes and beak) about 5%, with the balance (26%) made up of the inner organs.\n\nHumboldt squid are carnivorous marine invertebrates that move in shoals of up to 1,200 individuals. They swim at speeds up to propelled by water ejected through a hyponome (siphon) and by two triangular fins. Their tentacles bear 100–200 suckers, each lined with razor-sharp teeth, with which they grasp prey and drag it towards a large, sharp beak.\n\nAlthough Humboldt squid have a reputation of being aggressive towards humans, some disagreement exists on this subject. Research suggests these squid are only aggressive while feeding; at other times, they are quite passive. Their behavior while feeding often extends to cannibalism and they have been seen to readily attack injured or vulnerable squid of their own shoal. A quarter of squid stomachs analyzed contained remains of other squid. This behavior may account for a large proportion of their rapid growth. Some scientists claim the only reports of aggression towards humans have occurred when reflective diving gear or flashing lights have been present as a provocation. Roger Uzun, a veteran scuba diver and amateur underwater videographer who swam with a swarm of the animals for about 20 minutes, said they seemed to be more curious than aggressive. In circumstances where these animals are not feeding or being hunted, they exhibit curious and intelligent behavior..\n\nElectronic tagging has shown Humboldt squid undergo diel vertical migrations, which bring them closer to the surface from dusk to dawn. Humboldt squid are thought to have a lifespan of only about a year, although larger individuals may survive up to 2 years.\n\nA crittercam attached to two Humboldt squid revealed that they \"flash talk\" with each other by changing color in certain ways, and that they can disguise themselves by shifting the color patterns in other ways. What they are communicating to each other is unknown.\n\nRecent footage of shoals of these animals demonstrates a tendency to meet unfamiliar objects aggressively. Having risen to depths of below the surface to feed (up from their typical diving depth, beyond the range of human diving), they have attacked deep-sea cameras and rendered them inoperable. Humboldt squid have also been observed engaging in swarm behavior when met by the lights of submersibles, suggesting that they may follow or are attracted to light. Reports of recreational scuba divers being attacked by Humboldt squid have been confirmed. One particular diver, Scott Cassell, who has spent much of his career videotaping this species, has created body armor to protect against attacks.\n\nThe Humboldt squid lives at depths of in the eastern Pacific (Chile, Peru), ranging from Tierra del Fuego north to California. It gets its name from the Humboldt Current, in which it lives, off the coast of South America. Recently, the squid have been appearing farther north, as far as British Columbia. They have also ventured into Puget Sound.\n\nThough they usually prefer deep water, between 1,000 and 1,500 squid washed up on the Long Beach Peninsula in southwest Washington in late 2004 and red algae were a speculated cause for the late 2012 beaching of an unspecified number of juvenile squid (average length ) at Monterey Bay over a 2-month period.\n\nThe Humboldt squid's diet consists mainly of small fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and copepods. The squid uses its barbed tentacle suckers to grab its prey and slices and tears the victim's flesh with its beak and radula. They often approach prey quickly with all 10 appendages extended forward in a cone-like shape. Upon reaching striking distance, they open their eight swimming and grasping arms, and extend two long tentacles covered in sharp 'teeth', grabbing their prey and pulling it back towards a parrot-like beak, which can easily cause serious lacerations to human flesh. These two longer tentacles can reach full length, grab prey, and retract so fast that almost the entire event happens in one frame of a normal-speed video camera. Each of the squid's suckers is ringed with sharp teeth, and the beak can tear flesh, although they are believed to lack the jaw strength to crack heavy bone.\n\nAnother method of hunting is pulling the prey to great depths until it faints. The Humboldt squid is also known to quickly devour larger prey when hunting in groups. Until recently, claims of cooperative or coordinated hunting in \"D. gigas\" were considered unconfirmed and without scientific merit. However, research conducted between 2007 and 2011, published in June 2012, indicates this species does engage in cooperative hunting.\n\nScientists suspect the recent expansion of the squid's range north along the West Coast of the U.S. is the result of overfishing of longer-lived apex predators.\n\nCommercially, this species has been caught to serve the European community market (mainly Spain, Italy, France, and Ireland), Russia, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and increasingly North and South American markets.\n\nFishermen catch squid at night. Lights from the fishing boats reflect brightly on the plankton, which lure the squid to the surface to feed. Since the 1990s, the most important areas for landings of Humboldt squid are Chile, Mexico, and Peru (122–297, 53–66, and 291–435 thousand tonnes, respectively, in the period 2005–2007).\n\nHumboldt squid are known for their speed in feasting on hooked fish, sharks, and squid, even from their own species and shoal. Numerous accounts have the squid attacking fishermen and divers in the area. Their coloring and aggressive reputation have earned them the nickname \"diablos rojos\" (red devils) from fishermen off the coast of Mexico, as they flash red and white when struggling with the fishermen.\n\nHumboldt squid are generally found in the warm Pacific waters off the Mexican coast; studies published in the early 2000s indicated an increase in northern migration. The large 1997–98 El Niño event triggered the first sightings of Humboldt squid in Monterey Bay. Then, during the minor El Niño event of 2002, they returned to Monterey Bay in higher numbers and have been seen there year-round since then. Similar trends have been shown off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and even Alaska, although no year-round Humboldt squid populations are in these locations. This change in migration is suggested to be due to warming waters during El Niño events, but other factors, such as a decrease in upper trophic level predators that would compete with the squid for food, could be impacting the migration shift, as well.\n\nA 2008 study published in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\" predicts that by the end of the 21st century, ocean acidification will lower the Humboldt squid's metabolic rate by 31% and activity levels by 45%. This will lead the squid to have to retreat to shallower waters, where they can take up oxygen at higher rates.\n\nIn 2009, the Humboldt squid was featured in the final episode of the BBC's \"Last Chance to See\", with Stephen Fry and Mark Carwardine. The episode was about blue whales, but the presenters interviewed fishermen who talked about the exploding \"diablo rojo\" population in the Sea of Cortez and human attacks, and showed a squid trying to take a bite of a protectively clad forearm.\n\nIn 2016, the Humboldt squid featured in three television shows. The first, \"Man Eating Super Squid: A Monster Invasion,\" premiered on the National Geographic Wild channel and explored various attacks by Humboldt squid in Mexico. In the show, the Humboldt squid is referred to as a real-life kraken and as \"a global threat\".\n\nThe second show to feature the Humboldt squid recently is \"River Monsters: Devil of the Deep,\" where angler and TV show host Jeremy Wade sets off to the Sea of Cortez to investigate strange attacks on fishermen. Jeremy discovers that the fishermen were in fact attacked by Humboldt squid and that the Humboldt squid have now moved on from the Sea of Cortez south towards the coast of Peru. After joining a local fishing crew, Jeremy Wade catches multiple Humboldt squid off the coast of Peru.\n\nIn \"Fishing Impossible\" shown on British TV in 2016, the team travel 10 hours out into the Pacific Ocean and put on diving suits reinforced with chain mail to protect themselves, as they plan to capture a Humboldt squid by hand. However, bad weather prevents them from diving for the squid.\n\nIn 2016, Humboldt squid were featured on BBC Earth's \"Blue Planet II\" where the Humboldt's cannibalistic pack hunting was captured on film for the first time.\n\nA Humboldt Squid is a minor antagonist in the 2016 film \"Finding Dory\" where it chases and attempts to eat the main characters. This squid is presented as much larger than its real-life counterparts, easily destroying a shipping container which it seems to barely fit inside.\n\nIn another film, fishermen report, among other things, that a fisherman was caught in the abyss by a squid.

Zoologist, author and surrealist painter Desmond Morris first observed his abilities when the chimp was offered a pencil and paper at two years of age. By the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings. His style has been described as \"lyrical abstract impressionism\".\n\nCongo was born in 1954. He learned to draw near the age of two, beginning when zoologist Desmond Morris offered Congo a pencil. Morris said, \"He took a pencil and I placed a piece of card in front of him. This is how I recorded it at the time, 'Something strange was coming out of the end of the pencil. It was Congo's first line. It wandered a short way and then stopped. Would it happen again? Yes, it did, and again and again'.\" Morris soon observed that the chimp would draw circles, and had a basic sense of composition in his drawings. He also showed the ability of symmetrical consistency between two sides of a sketch; when Morris drew a shape at one side of a piece of paper, Congo would balance the structure by making marks on the other half of the paper. Similarly, if a color on one side contained blue for example, he would add blue to the other side as well to keep balance.\n\nHe soon began painting; the patterns he made were never distinguished, pictorial images, but usually of a vague \"radiating fan pattern\" in the abstract impressionism style. Between the ages of two and four, he produced about 400 drawings and paintings.\n\nThrough that time, Congo developed a familiarity with his routine painting sessions with Morris. When a picture was taken away that he didn't consider complete, Congo would reportedly begin to scream and \"throw fits\". Also, if the ape considered one of his drawings to be finished, he would refuse to continue painting even if someone tried to persuade him to do so.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he made appearances on the British television show Zootime, which was presented live from the London Zoo by Desmond Morris. He died at ten years of age in 1964 of tuberculosis.\n\nMedia reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. Spanish painter Pablo Picasso was reportedly a \"fan\" of his paintings, and hung one of the ape's pictures on his studio wall after receiving it as a gift.\n\nOn June 20, 2005, Congo's paintings were included in an auction at Bonhams alongside works by Renoir and Warhol—they sold for more than expected, while Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for over US$25,000.\n\n"}

He was apparently a member of the Yngling clan (mentioned in later Norse and Anglo-Saxon literature, such as \"Beowulf\"). His name \"Heiðumhæri\" could be translated as \"highly honoured\"\n\nHis greatest contribution to posterity was that he asked the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir to compose a poem about his ancestry.

{"id": "1876548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876548", "title": "WJZ-TV", "text": "WJZ-TV\n\nWJZ-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 13, is a CBS owned-and-operated television station licensed to Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The station is owned by the CBS Television Stations subsidiary of ViacomCBS. WJZ-TV's studios and offices are located on Television Hill in the Woodberry section of Baltimore, adjacent to the transmission tower it shares with several other Baltimore broadcast outlets.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 23. On Verizon FiOS, DirecTV and Dish Network and in most outlying areas of the market, it is carried on channel 13.\n\nBaltimore's third television station started on November 1, 1948 as WAAM. The station was originally owned by Radio-Television of Baltimore Inc., whose principals were Baltimore businessmen and brothers, Ben and Herman Cohen. Channel 13 was originally an ABC affiliate, the network's fifth outlet to be located on the East Coast. Until 1956, it carried an additional primary affiliation with the DuMont Television Network. On the station's second day of operations, WAAM broadcast the 1948 presidential election returns and various entertainment shows, remaining on the air for 23 consecutive hours. Channel 13 has been housed in the same studio facility, located near Druid Hill Park on what was then known as Malden Hill (now known as Television Hill), since the station's inception; the building was the first in Baltimore specifically designed for television production and broadcasting. As a DuMont affiliate, WAAM originated many Baltimore Colts games for the network's National Football League coverage.\n\nThe Westinghouse Electric Corporation purchased WAAM from the Cohen brothers in May 1957. Westinghouse then took control of the station in August of that year, and changed its callsign to WJZ-TV the following month. The WJZ call letters had previously resided on ABC's flagship radio/television combination in New York City, which changed its calls to WABC-AM-FM-TV in 1953. However, Westinghouse's history with that set of call letters went back even further, as it was the original owner of WJZ radio, the flagship station of NBC's Blue Network, which would eventually become ABC.\n\nAll of Baltimore's television stations at the time had fairly short transmission towers in the medium's early years; channel 13's original tower was located next to the station's studios. In 1959, the three stations—WJZ-TV, WBAL-TV (channel 11) and WMAR-TV (channel 2)—formed a joint venture to build the world's first three-pronged candelabra tower. Constructed behind the WJZ-TV studios and opposite the original channel 13 tower, it was the tallest free standing television antenna in the United States at the time of its completion. The new tower significantly improved channel 13's signal coverage in central Maryland, and also added new viewers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington, D.C. and Virginia.\n\nWJZ-TV nearly lost its ABC affiliation in 1977, when the network briefly pursued WBAL-TV just as ABC became the most-watched broadcast network (in prime time) in the United States for the first time. However, WBAL-TV declined the ABC affiliation offer due to ABC's last-place network evening newscast offerings of the time (a situation that would improve in ensuing years), keeping ABC on channel 13.\n\nIn June 1994, ABC agreed to an affiliation deal with the broadcasting division of the E. W. Scripps Company, which resulted in three of Scripps' television stations—WMAR-TV in Baltimore, WFTS-TV in Tampa and KNXV-TV in Phoenix—becoming ABC affiliates. ABC agreed to the deal as a condition of keeping its affiliation on Scripps' two biggest stations, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and WEWS in Cleveland. Both stations had been heavily courted by CBS, which was about to lose two of its longtime affiliates—WJBK and WJW—to Fox. ABC was reluctant to include WMAR, then an NBC affiliate, in the deal; it had been a ratings also-ran for over 30 years while WJZ-TV was one of the strongest ABC affiliates in the nation. However, not wanting to be relegated to UHF in two markets with few viable choices for a new affiliate, ABC opted to end its 46-year affiliation with channel 13 and move its affiliation to channel 2.\n\nGroup W felt betrayed by ABC after so many years of loyalty, as channel 13 had been ABC's longest-tenured affiliate at the time (a distinction that now belongs to WJLA-TV). As a safeguard, it began to shop for an affiliation deal of its own. One month later, Westinghouse agreed to a long-term affiliation contract with CBS, resulting in WJZ-TV and its sister stations in Philadelphia and Boston switching to CBS (Westinghouse's two other television stations, in Pittsburgh and San Francisco, were already CBS affiliates). The affiliation switch, the second in Baltimore television history, occurred early on the morning of January 2, 1995. The last ABC prime time program to air on channel 13 was the made-for-TV movie \"A Dangerous Affair\", which was broadcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 1, and the final overall ABC program to air on channel 13 was the January 2 edition of \"ABC World News Now\". As a result, channel 13 became the third station in Baltimore to affiliate with CBS. The network had originally affiliated with WMAR-TV in 1948 before moving to WBAL-TV in 1981. Westinghouse then bought CBS on November 24, 1995, making WJZ-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station. Notably, this marked the first time that CBS had wholly owned a station in the Baltimore/Washington corridor; it had been minority owner of WTOP-TV in Washington (now WUSA) from 1950 to 1955.\n\nWJZ-TV has used its current stylized \"13\" logo, using a font face exclusive to Group W, since 1967. In 2002, the CBS eye was added, and in 2018, the station switched to a silver and gold-colored version (resembling logo styles used by its sister stations) with the WJZ call letters displayed below in squares.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio agreed to merge with Entercom, which effectively separated WJZ-TV from WJZ radio.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWJZ-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 38 to VHF channel 13 for post-transition operations. WMAR-TV took over the channel 38 allocation as it moved its digital signal from channel 52 as a result of the phaseout of channels 52–69.\n\nThe switch caused problems for some viewers due to reception issues related to the transition, but the Federal Communications Commission granted WJZ-TV a power increase that helps some people.\n\nAs a part of the repacking process following the 2016–2017 FCC incentive auction, WJZ-TV will relocate to VHF channel 11 on July 3, 2020, using PSIP to display its virtual channel number as 13. Because WBAL-TV is currently on channel 11, WBAL-TV will move to channel 12 to allow WJZ-TV to move to that channel.\n\nWJZ-TV is the Baltimore area affiliate of the \"It's Academic\" high school quiz competition which originated in Washington since it expanded to the area in 1971. Channel 13 has also served two stints as the television home of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, from 1954 to 1978 and from 1994 until 2017. It is one of the few \"Big Three\" stations to air baseball on a regular basis.\n\nOver the years, WJZ-TV frequently preempted ABC programming in favor of locally produced programs and syndicated content from Westinghouse's broadcasting division, Group W, such as \"The Mike Douglas Show\" and the original version of \"The Merv Griffin Show\"; notably, the former ABC daytime soap opera \"Dark Shadows\" was preempted during the mid-1960s. However, ABC was more than satisfied with channel 13, which was one of its strongest affiliates. Additionally, Baltimore viewers could watch ABC programs on Washington's WMAL-TV/WJLA-TV (channel 7), whose signal decently covers most of the Baltimore area.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1964, one of the station's highest-rated programs was \"The Buddy Deane Show\", an in-studio teen dance show similar to ABC's \"American Bandstand\", which WJZ-TV also preempted in favor of the Deane program. Deane's program was the inspiration for the John Waters 1988 motion picture \"Hairspray\" and its subsequent Broadway musical version, which in turn has been made into a film.\n\nSince becoming a CBS affiliate, WJZ-TV has carried the network's lineup in pattern with virtually no preemptions except for breaking news emergencies and Orioles baseball games, as per an agreement between Group W and CBS.\n\nPrior to September 2019, WJZ-TV has aired the \"CBS Evening News\" on a 30-minute tape delay due to an hour-long 6 p.m. newscast. Syndicated programming carried on the station includes \"Maury\", \"Dr. Phil\" and \"Entertainment Tonight\". WJZ-TV is the only CBS O&O station in the nation to carry the former show. The latter two shows are distributed by CBS' corporate cousin, CBS Television Distribution.\n\nChannel 13 has been the \"de facto\" broadcaster for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League, airing a majority of the team's contests since CBS acquired rights to the American Football Conference in 1998, including their two Super Bowl appearances, both victories, at the end of the 2000 and 2012 seasons. As an ABC station, WJZ-TV broadcast limited Baltimore Orioles games via ABC's MLB broadcast contract from 1976 to 1989.\n\nWJZ-TV presently broadcasts 38 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). Like other CBS-owned stations, channel 13 offers a web-only newscast, \"WJZ At Your Desk\", which is produced each weekday.\n\nSoon after Westinghouse bought WJZ-TV, it significantly beefed up the station's news department. On October 12, 1957, WJZ-TV cameraman John Kelly filmed a motion picture of the final stage of Sputnik 1's rocket crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, featured in a half-hour special program on Sputnik, broadcast that evening by Westinghouse sister station WBZ-TV in Boston. Within a few years, it passed WMAR-TV for second place. Like the other Group W stations, WJZ-TV adopted the \"Eyewitness News\" format pioneered at Philadelphia sister station KYW-TV. By the early 1970s, WJZ-TV had passed WBAL-TV for first place—a lead it held for over 30 years. Around 2001, however, WBAL-TV passed WJZ-TV for first place in all evening timeslots, though WJZ-TV still placed a strong second. However, in the official November 2009 Nielsen ratings sweeps period, the first since the debut of \"The Jay Leno Show\" (which aired on WBAL-TV), WJZ-TV returned to a dominant position at 11 p.m. for the first time since the early 2000s. Both stations spent the next two years in a virtual dead heat in the late news. However, since the November 2011 Nielsen sweeps period, WJZ has dominated over WBAL in all news time slots in both total households and the critical 25–54 demographic; however, WBAL remains a strong second. It has been one of CBS's strongest O&Os ever since the 1995 affiliation switch.\n\nWJZ-TV was the first station in Baltimore to hire a full-time consumer reporter, as well as the first station to organize an investigative reporting team. In 1965, shortly after it adopted the \"Eyewitness News\" format, Wiley Daniels became the first African-American anchor in Baltimore. He worked alongside Jerry Turner, one of the most popular anchormen in Baltimore television history. Al Sanders succeeded Daniels in 1977; he and Turner were the top news team until Turner succumbed to esophageal cancer. Denise Koch succeeded Turner upon his death in 1987; she remains at the anchor desk alongside Vic Carter, who succeeded Sanders following the latter's death in 1995.\n\nIn 1976, Oprah Winfrey became an anchor for the station's 6:00 p.m. newscast. She also co-hosted channel 13's local talk show, \"People Are Talking\" with Richard Sher, which premiered on August 14, 1978, until she left for Chicago in 1983. \n\nSince September 2008, \"The Baltimore Sun\" has had a news partnership with WJZ-TV; involving sharing content, story leads, and cooperating together on stories. Channel 13 promotes stories featured in the \"Sun\" on its news broadcasts. The \"Sun\" promotes WJZ's stories and weather team on its pages. Coincidentally, \"The Baltimore Sun\" was the founder and original owner of rival WMAR-TV from 1947 to 1986.\n\nOn October 25, 2009, WJZ-TV became the third Baltimore station to begin airing newscasts in high definition. For several months after the upgrade, field reports were still presented in standard definition until it switched over to the widescreen format. As of September 2011, all of WJZ-TV's locally produced video footage, including remote field reports, are in HD, making it the first station in Baltimore to do so.\n\nDuring the noon newscast on August 9, 2018, WJZ-TV unveiled a new set, and introduced the same on-air graphics scheme used by other CBS owned-and-operated stations (the last among the group to do so). On August 20, 2018, WJZ-TV expanded its morning newscasts from 5–7 a.m. to 4:30–7 a.m., becoming the last station in Baltimore to start their morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m. On September 9, 2019, WJZ debuted a 7 p.m. newscast for the first time, and the \"CBS Evening News\" was moved to 6:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nIn Delaware, WJZ is carried on Comcast in Sussex County. There is no coverage in most of New Castle County except in the area of Middletown for Atlantic Broadband cable subscribers. There is no coverage in all of Kent County. New Castle and Kent counties are part of the Philadelphia market, which also carries WJZ's sister station KYW-TV. Only Sussex County is part of the Salisbury, Maryland market which carries its CBS affiliate, WBOC. In the beginning of CATV, most if not all of Delaware once carried WJZ.\n\nIn Maryland, the eastern shore communities of Cambridge, East New Market/Secretary, Pocomoke City, Ocean City, Salisbury and Snow Hill carry WJZ. These areas are in the Salisbury market which WBOC is carried. From Hagerstown and west towards Cumberland, WJZ is carried there as well in the far northwestern part of the Washington, D.C. market. Between Hagerstown and Cumberland, the towns of Hancock and Oldtown do not carry WJZ.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, it is carried in Greencastle, Delta, Hanover, Waynesboro and York County (but not in the city of York) which are in the Harrisburg–Lancaster–York market. In the Philadelphia market, it is carried in Oxford in Chester County.\n\nWJZ is carried on cable in portions of Virginia located in the far western end of the Washington, D.C. market, alongside Washington's CBS affiliate WUSA. It is carried on cable in the Shenandoah Valley in Elkton, Front Royal, Luray and Winchester. In West Virginia, it is carried in the Martinsburg area; it is part of the Washington, D.C. market, which carries WUSA as well. In Keyser, Mineral County, WJZ is carried on cable.\n\nDuring the 1970s and possibly the 1980s with CATV, WJZ was once on the cable lineups in Salem and Cumberland counties in southwestern New Jersey.\n\nWJZ's former analog signal could be picked up via antenna as far west as Warrenton and Culpeper, Virginia and as far east as Salem County, New Jersey. There is no satellite coverage outside of the Baltimore market for WJZ.\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Hearst Corporation and broadcasts a mainstream rock format. WIYY shares a studio/office facility with sister stations WBAL (1090 AM) and WBAL-TV (channel 11) on Television Hill in the Woodberry section of Baltimore, near the transmission tower it shares with WBAL-TV. WIYY and WBAL are the only two radio stations owned by the Hearst Corporation, and are also co-owned with the TV station. WBAL Radio is simulcast through WIYY's HD2 HD Radio subchannel.\n\nWIYY and WBAL are the flagship stations of the Baltimore Ravens radio network, sharing the 'official broadcaster' title with WBAL-TV (the city's NBC affiliate), which airs the team's television-focused programming.\n\nIn January 1948, WMAR-FM signed on for the first time at 97.9, owned by the A.S. Abell Company, publishers of the \"Baltimore Sun\" and founders of WMAR-TV, Baltimore's first television station. The first station to use that call sign (and not related to the second WMAR-FM at 106.5, now WWMX), WMAR-FM was a collaborative partner of Transit Rides Inc., developer of a music format designed for public transportation and owned by the Cincinnati-based Taft family. After two years on the air, Abell shut down the station in June 1950 and turned in its license to the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe 97.9 frequency remained silent until December 1958 when WFDS-FM signed on for the first time, a classical music outlet under the ownership of William S. Cook, a Baltimore native and professional engineer. Cook created WFDS-FM as one of the first radio stations in the United States to experiment with stereo. The Hearst Corporation purchased the station in April 1960 and retained classical music while changing the call sign to WBAL-FM.\n\nIn June 1975 WBAL-FM joined NBC Radio Network's 24-hour national \"News and Information Service\" (NIS), and was the largest affiliate of NIS not to be an NBC Radio owned-and-operated station. After two years of all-news and low ratings, NBC closed down NIS in late May 1977. But WBAL-FM bailed on the service early, adopting its present elements—the call letters WIYY, rock music format and the \"98 Rock\" branding—on March 28, 1977.\n\nIn 2007, the station was nominated for the Radio & Records magazine \"Active Rock station of the year in a top 25 market award\" .

Originally discovered by their ability to induce the formation of bone and cartilage, BMPs are now considered to constitute a group of pivotal morphogenetic signals, orchestrating tissue architecture throughout the body. The important functioning of BMP signals in physiology is emphasized by the multitude of roles for dysregulated BMP signalling in pathological processes. Cancerous disease often involves misregulation of the BMP signalling system. Absence of BMP signalling is, for instance, an important factor in the progression of colon cancer, and conversely, overactivation of BMP signalling following reflux-induced esophagitis provokes Barrett's esophagus and is thus instrumental in the development of adenocarcinoma in the proximal portion of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nRecombinant human BMPs (rhBMPs) are used in orthopedic applications such as spinal fusions, nonunions and oral surgery. rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for some uses. rhBMP-2 causes more overgrown bone than any other BMPs and is widely used off-label.\n\nBMPs for clinical use are produced using recombinant DNA technology (recombinant human BMPs; rhBMPs). Recombinant BMP-2 and BMP-7 are currently approved for human use.\n\nrhBMPs are used in oral surgeries. BMP-7 has also recently found use in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). BMP-7 has been shown in murine animal models to reverse the loss of glomeruli due to sclerosis.\n\nAlthough rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 are used in the treatment of a variety of bone-related conditions including spinal fusions and nonunions, the risks of this off-label treatment are not understood. While rhBMPs are approved for specific applications (spinal lumbar fusions with an anterior approach and tibia nonunions), up to 85% of all BMP usage is off-label. rhBMP-2 is used extensively in other lumbar spinal fusion techniques (e.g., using a posterior approach, anterior or posterior cervical fusions).\n\nIn 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rhBMP-7 (a.k.a. OP-1; Stryker Biotech) for a humanitarian device exemption as an alternative to autograft in long bone nonunions. In 2004, the humanitarian device exemption was extended as an alternative to autograft for posterolateral fusion. In 2002, rhBMP-2 (Infuse; Medtronic) was approved for anterior lumbar interbody fusions (ALIFs) with a lumbar fusion device. In 2008 it was approved to repair posterolateral lumbar pseudarthrosis, open tibia shaft fractures with intramedullary nail fixation. In these products, BMPs are delivered to the site of the fracture by being incorporated into a bone implant, and released gradually to allow bone formation, as the growth stimulation by BMPs must be localized and sustained for some weeks. The BMPs are eluted through a purified collagen matrix which is implanted in the site of the fracture. rhBMP-2 helps grow bone better than any other rhBMP so it is much more widely used clinically. There is \"little debate or controversy\" about the effectiveness of rhBMP-2 to grow bone to achieve spinal fusions, and Medtronic generates $700 million in annual sales from their product.\n\nBone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP) should not be routinely used in any type of anterior cervical spine fusion, such as with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. There are reports of this therapy causing swelling of soft tissue which in turn can cause life-threatening complications due to difficulty swallowing and pressure on the respiratory tract.\n\nBMPs interact with specific receptors on the cell surface, referred to as bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPRs).\n\nSignal transduction through BMPRs results in mobilization of members of the SMAD family of proteins. The signaling pathways involving BMPs, BMPRs and SMADs are important in the development of the heart, central nervous system, and cartilage, as well as post-natal bone development.\n\nThey have an important role during embryonic development on the embryonic patterning and early skeletal formation. As such, disruption of BMP signaling can affect the body plan of the developing embryo. For example, BMP4 and its inhibitors noggin and chordin help regulate polarity of the embryo (i.e. back to front patterning). Specifically BMP-4 and its inhibitors play a major role in neurulation and the development of the neural plate. BMP-4 signals ectoderm cells to develop into skin cells, but the secretion of inhibitors by the underlying mesoderm blocks the action of BMP-4 to allow the ectoderm to continue on its normal course of neural cell development. Additionally, secretion of BMPs by the roof plate in the developing spinal cord helps to specify dorsal sensory interneurons.\n\nAs a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, BMP signaling regulates a variety of embryonic patterning during fetal and embryonic development. For example, BMP signaling controls the early formation of the Mullerian duct (MD) which is a tubular structure in early embryonic developmental stage and eventually becomes female reproductive tracts. Chemical inhibiting BMP signals in chicken embryo caused a disruption of MD invagination and blocked the epithelial thickening of the MD-forming region, indicating that the BMP signals play a role in early MD development. Moreover, BMP signaling is involved in the formation of foregut and hindgut, intestinal villus patterning, and endocardial differentiation. Villi contribute to increase the effective absorption of nutrients by extending the surface area in small intestine. Gain or lose function of BMP signaling altered the patterning of clusters and emergence of villi in mouse intestinal model. BMP signal derived from myocardium is also involved in endocardial differentiation during heart development. Inhibited BMP signal in zebrafish embryonic model caused strong reduction of endocardial differentiation, but only had little effect in myocardial development. In addition, Notch-Wnt-Bmp crosstalk is required for radial patterning during mouse cochlea development via antagonizing manner.\n\nMutations in BMPs and their inhibitors are associated with a number of human disorders which affect the skeleton.\n\nSeveral BMPs are also named 'cartilage-derived morphogenetic proteins' (CDMPs), while others are referred to as 'growth differentiation factors' (GDFs).\n\nBMPs are also involved in adipogenesis and functional regulation of adipose tissue. BMP4 favors white adipogenesis, whereas BMP7 activates brown fat functionality; BMP inhibitors are also involved in this regulation \n\nOriginally, seven such proteins were discovered. Of these, six (BMP2 through BMP7) belong to the Transforming growth factor beta superfamily of proteins. BMP1 is a metalloprotease. Since then, thirteen more BMPs, all of which are in the TGF-beta family, have been discovered, bringing the total to twenty. The current nomenclature only recognizes 13, as many others are put under the growth differentiation factor naming instead.\n\nFrom the time of Hippocrates it has been known that bone has considerable potential for regeneration and repair. Nicholas Senn, a surgeon at Rush Medical College in Chicago, described the utility of antiseptic decalcified bone implants in the treatment of osteomyelitis and certain bone deformities. Pierre Lacroix proposed that there might be a hypothetical substance, osteogenin, that might initiate bone growth.\n\nThe biological basis of bone morphogenesis was shown by Marshall R. Urist. Urist made the key discovery that demineralized, lyophilized segments of bone induced new bone formation when implanted in muscle pouches in rabbits. This discovery was published in 1965 by Urist in \"Science\". Urist proposed the name \"Bone Morphogenetic Protein\" in the scientific literature in the \"Journal of Dental Research\" in 1971.\n\nBone induction is a sequential multistep cascade. The key steps in this cascade are chemotaxis, mitosis, and differentiation. Early studies by Hari Reddi unraveled the sequence of events involved in bone matrix-induced bone morphogenesis. On the basis of the above work, it seemed likely that morphogens were present in the bone matrix. Using a battery of bioassays for bone formation, a systematic study was undertaken to isolate and purify putative bone morphogenetic proteins.\n\nA major stumbling block to purification was the insolubility of demineralized bone matrix. To overcome this hurdle, Hari Reddi and Kuber Sampath used dissociative extractants, such as 4M guanidine HCL, 8M urea, or 1% SDS. The soluble extract alone or the insoluble residues alone were incapable of new bone induction. This work suggested that the optimal osteogenic activity requires a synergy between soluble extract and the insoluble collagenous substratum. It not only represented a significant advance toward the final purification of bone morphogenetic proteins by the Reddi laboratory, but ultimately also enabled the cloning of BMPs by John Wozney and colleagues at Genetics Institute.\n\nAt between US$6000 and $10,000 for a typical treatment, BMPs can be costly compared with other techniques such as bone grafting. However, this cost is often far less than the costs required with orthopaedic revision in multiple surgeries.\n\nWhile there is little debate that rhBMPs are successful clinically, there is controversy about their use. It is common for orthopedic surgeons to be paid for their contribution to the development of a new product, but some of the surgeons responsible for the original Medtronic-supported studies on the efficacy of rhBMP-2 have been accused of bias and conflict of interest. For example, one surgeon, a lead author on four of these research papers, did not disclose any financial ties while with the company on three of the papers; he was paid over $4 million by Medtronic. In another study, the lead author did not disclose any financial ties to Medtronic; he was paid at least $11 million by the company. In a series of 12 publications, the median financial ties of the authors to Medtronic were $12–16 million. In those studies that had more than 20 and 100 patients, one or more authors had financial ties of $1 million and $10 million, respectively. Early clinical trials using rhBMP-2 underreported adverse events associated with treatment. In the 13 original industry-sponsored publications related to safety, there were zero adverse events in 780 patients. It has since been revealed that potential complications can arise from the use including implant displacement, subsidence, infection, urogenital events, and retrograde ejaculation.\n\nBased on a study conducted by the Department of Family Medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University the use of BMP increased rapidly, from 5.5% of fusion cases in 2003 to 28.1% of fusion cases in 2008. BMP use was greater among patients with previous surgery and among those having complex fusion procedures (combined anterior and posterior approach, or greater than 2 disc levels). Major medical complications, wound complications, and 30-day rehospitalization rates were nearly identical with or without BMP. Reoperation rates were also very similar, even after stratifying by previous surgery or surgical complexity, and after adjusting for demographic and clinical features. On average, adjusted hospital charges for operations involving BMP were about $15,000 more than hospital charges for fusions without BMP, though reimbursement under Medicare's Diagnosis-Related Group system averaged only about $850 more. Significantly fewer patients receiving BMP were discharged to a skilled nursing facility.\n\n"}

He was baptized in the village church on March 14 of the same year. As a worker in Riga, Pelše joined the Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks) of the Latvian Region in 1915. In 1916 he met Lenin in Switzerland. Between 1914 and 1918, Pelše worked in the workshops of Riga and Vitebsk, as a milling machine operator at the steam-engine making plant in Kharkov, as a punching worker in Petrograd and a loader in the port of Arkhangelsk. On behalf of the local committees he had joined the revolutionary propaganda. He was delegate of the sixth congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party of the Arkhangelsk party organization. He participated in the February Revolution in 1917 and was a member of the famous Petrograd Soviet. He was actively involved in the preparation and conducting of the October Revolution in 1917. In 1918 he joined the Cheka. In 1918, he was sent by Lenin to Latvia to prosecute the revolution there. In 1919 he was attached to the Red Army and later became a manager in the Construction Ministry of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. After the defeat of the Soviet Latvian régime he returned to Russia in 1919.\n\nHe was a lecturer and political commissar in the Red Army from 1919 to 1929. In 1931 he graduated from the history department of the Moscow Institute of the Red Professoriat, and between 1931 and 1933 he was a graduate student in the institute. At the same time he was an instructor at the Institute of Party History at the Central School of NKVD between 1929 and 1932. Between 1933 and 1937 he was first deputy of the Commissariat of State Farms (Sovkhozes). Between 1937 and 1940 he taught history in the Moscow Higher Educational Institute. In June 1940 he played a leading role in the process of admitting of Latvia into the USSR. From March 1941 to 1959 he served as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia for propaganda and agitation. During the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945 he worked to prepare the party and the Soviet cadres to transform Latvia into a communist state.\n\nIn 1958 he traveled to Denmark to attend the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of Denmark.\n\nJuly 1959 to November 1959 marked the purge of all nascent nationalism from the Latvian communist party—about 2,000 of the party leadership and activists were stripped of their posts and privileges.\n\nThe Soviets elevated Pelše to First Secretary, replacing the purged Kalnbērziņš on November 25, 1959. In January 1960, Pelše promptly denounced his former (purged) associates for deviating from \"the right path in carrying out Leninist nationality policy\". From that point forward, the First Secretaries of the Latvian SSR were servile party functionaries, as first embodied by Pelše, whom Latvians regarded as symbols of submissiveness to the Soviets.\n\nPelše was appointed as member of the Central Committee in 1961. That same year, after Yuri Gagarin returned from his space mission, Pelše proposed changing the name of the Latvian capital Rīga but even the Soviet central authorities saw this as too extreme an action.\n\nIn 1963, Pelše headed a commission nicknamed the \"Pelše Commission\", which investigated the assassination of Sergey Kirov. The commission finished its work in 1967.\n\nPelše served as First Secretary of the Latvian SSR until April 15, 1966. At the 23rd Party Congress in 1966 Pelše addressed his colleagues as follows:\n\nOn November 7, 1975 Pelše gave a speech in the ceremony commemorating the 58th anniversary of the October Revolution. In his address \nPelše confirmed continuing Soviet support for \"fighters for freedom\" and \"the patriots in Angola.\"\n\nHe was rewarded for his faithful service, being selected by the 23rd Party Congress for full membership to the Politburo of the CPSU, a position he held until his death in May 1983. Pelše was also Chairman of the Party Control Committee, which oversaw the discipline of party members, from 1966 to 1983.\n\nPelše's health was failing in his last years. When he did not attend Leonid Brezhnev's funeral in November 1982, rumors spread he had died, but a few days later, on November 23, he appeared in a session of the Supreme Soviet. Another absence which was noticed by the media was in the ceremony marking the centennial of the death of Karl Marx, on March 31, 1983, one month before he died.\n\nHe suffered from lung cancer. He also suffered from atelectasis which aggravated the lungs, and worsening cardiopulmonary failure. He died of Cardiac arrest at 5:55, May 29, 1983. Pelše was honoured with a state funeral; His remains lay in state at the House of Trade Unions. On June 2 his ashes were carried by an armoured vehicle to Red Square, with the all the Politburo members stand at the top of Lenin's Mausoleum. After lavish eulogies were read by Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and Politburo member Viktor Grishin, his ashes were laid to rest in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\nPelše wrote some works on the history of the CPSU and the party, on the history of the revolutionary movement in Latvia, anti-capitalists nationalists, the socialist and communist construction in the country.\n\nHe was twice awarded with Hero of the Socialist Labor (1969, 1979), 6 Lenin Order, the Order of the October Revolution and other medals. The Rīga Polytechnic Institute was named for Pelše after he died.\n\nPelše was married three times. He had two children from the first marriage: a daughter, Beruta (died), and son, Arvik (died during World War II). One son from the second marriage, Tai, (was born in 1930) - a pensioner, and did not support any contacts with his father after the 3rd marriage. The third wife of Pelše was Lidiya, the ex-wife of Stalin's secretary Alexander Poskrebyshev. From 1966 until his death he lived in 15 Spiridonovka Street. A commemorative plaque was placed in the front of the building.\n\nRemeikis, Thomas: “A Latvian in the Politbureau: A Political Portrait of Arvids Pelše.” Lituanus 12:1 (1966) 81-84.

She is known only through the Roman historian Livy's account of the introduction, growth and spread of unofficial Bacchanalia festivals, which were ferociously suppressed in 186 BC under threat of extreme penalty. \n\nPaculla Annia is said to have presided over the corruption of Bacchus's mystery cult and its holy \"orgia\", starting around 188. Livy describes the Bacchanalia as hitherto reserved to women, a daylight ritual held on just three days of the year; Paculla Annia changed them to nocturnal rites, increased their frequency to five a month, opened them to all social classes and both sexes - starting with her own sons, Minius and Herennius Cerrinius - and made wine-fueled violence and sexual promiscuity mandatory for all initiates. The cult was thought to function as a hidden state within the state, with particular appeal to those with \"leuitas animi\" (fickle or uneducated minds); the lower classes, plebeians, women, the young, morally weak, and \"men most like women\" were thought most susceptible but even men of the highest class were not immune. \n\nA virtuous ex-initiate and prostitute, Hispala Faecenia, though fearing the vengeance of the cult, revealed all to a shocked Roman senate. Once their investigation was complete, they suppressed the cult, saving Rome from the divine wrath and disaster it would otherwise have suffered. Livy claims that six thousand were executed, and that the arrests included Paculla's son, Minius Cerrineus. The legislation against the cult, or rather its forced reformation, is given in the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus. Paculla's fate is unknown.\n\nMost modern scholarship agrees that Dionysiac or Bacchic mystery cults had been practiced in Roman Italy for several decades before 186, and were considered acceptable by Roman authorities until this abrupt \"discovery\" and rapid suppression. Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes attributed to her by Livy; many of his \"dramatis personae\", stylistic flourishes and tropes may draw more on Roman satyr plays than on the Bacchanalia themselves. Hispala Faecenia provides the dramatic trope of \"golden-hearted prostitute\", whose courageous testimony, goodness, and loyalty far outweigh her low origin, profession and fear of reprisal. Fontaine, assuming Plautus's \"Truculentus\" as contemporary with or no earlier than the events of 186, speculates its plot, themes and central character, the greedy, scheming, \"evil courtesan\" Phrynesium, arch-manipulator of men, as a \"thinly veiled and politically conservative allegory\" of Paculla Annia and her involvement with the Bacchanalia, particularly her illicit introduction of men into the cult, and its challenge to an established order and rule.\n\nThe \"Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus\" has been interpreted as an assertion of Rome's civil and religious authority, either throughout the Italian peninsula or within Roman territories, following the recent Punic War and subsequent social and political instability. Illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin.\n"}

{"id": "1876606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876606", "title": "Rainbow jersey", "text": "Rainbow jersey\n\nThe rainbow jersey is the distinctive jersey worn by the reigning world champion in a cycling discipline, since 1927. The jersey is predominantly white with five horizontal bands in the UCI colours around the chest. From the bottom up the colours are: green, yellow, black, red and blue; the same colours that appear in the rings on the Olympic flag. The tradition is applied to all disciplines, including road racing, track racing, cyclo-cross, BMX, Trials and the disciplines within mountain biking. The jersey is produced by Santini SMS since 1994.\n\nA world champion must wear the jersey when competing in the same discipline, category and speciality for which the title was won. For example, the world road race champion would wear the garment while competing in stage races (except for time trial stages) and one-day races, but would not be entitled to wear it during time trials. Similarly, on the track, the world individual pursuit champion would only wear the jersey when competing in other individual pursuit events.\nIn team events, such as the team pursuit, each member of the team must wear the rainbow jersey, but – again – would not wear it while racing in, say, points races or other track disciplines.\n\nThe rainbow jersey helps make a world champion easier to spot for spectators, but it also has the effect of making the title-holder more visible to other competitors, particularly in road racing situations. This can be a disadvantage as it makes it more difficult for the world champion to launch an attack, while other riders will quickly seek to take advantage if they notice the rainbow jersey crashes or suffers a mechanical or other problem. There is also reduced space for sponsors' logos on the world champion's jerseys; however, the increased media coverage of a reigning world champion is thought to offset the effects of the smaller logo space.\n\nFailure to wear the rainbow jersey where required carries a penalty of 2500 to 5000 Swiss francs.\n\nAfter the end of a rider's championship year, they are eligible to wear piping in the same rainbow pattern on the collar and cuffs of their jersey. They retain this right for the remainder of their career.\n\nIf the holder of a rainbow jersey becomes leader of a multi-stage race (such as the Tour de France) then the leader's jersey (Yellow jersey) for that race takes precedence. Similarly, the leader's jerseys for UCI World Cup series also take precedence over the rainbow jersey, although, in 2006, Road Race World Champion Tom Boonen at one point was the leader of the Road Racing World Cup, and he, as well as his sponsor and the organizers of the race he was competing in at that time (Gent–Wevelgem) wanted him to continue wearing the rainbow jersey. A compromise was reached and Boonen wore a jersey which was a combination of the Rainbow jersey and the UCI World Cup jersey.\n\nThe reigning world champions (elite only) are as follows:\n\nSimilar to the \"Sports Illustrated\" cover jinx, the curse of the rainbow jersey is a popular term to refer to the phenomenon where cyclists who have become World Champion often suffer from poor luck the next year – though, in some cases, the 'bad luck' was brought on by their own actions.\n\nTom Simpson of the United Kingdom won the world title in 1965. During the following winter (Jan/Feb 1966) he broke his leg skiing thus missing out on his most lucrative benefits from wearing the rainbow jersey.\n\nOther notable 'victims' of the curse include the 1970 world champion Jean-Pierre Monseré who died wearing the rainbow jersey in March 1971.\n\nThe 1981 winner, Freddy Maertens of Belgium, also won the Green Jersey in the 1981 Tour De France, but in 1982 won no races, and only won a further two races in his professional cycling career.\n\nThe 1987 winner, Irishman Stephen Roche, who had won the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia in the same season, had a disastrous following year, missing nearly the entire season with a knee injury.\n\nThe 1990 winner, Rudy Dhaenens of Belgium, had no results in 1991, and was forced to retire shortly after with heart problems. He was killed in a car accident six years later at the age of 36.\n\nThe 1994 winner, Luc Leblanc of France had an injury plagued following season with very poor results, winning only one small race, before bouncing back in 1996.\n\nThe 1997 winner, Laurent Brochard, became entangled in the infamous Festina doping scandal a year later.\n\nThe 2003 winner, Spaniard Igor Astarloa, switched to the French team Cofidis for the 2004 season which almost immediately suspended itself from racing due to doping allegations against several members of the team. In response to this, Astarloa switched first to the Lampre team, and then the Barloworld team. He has had a very quiet career since his 2003 victory.\n\nThe 2004 World Road Champion Óscar Freire was in good form throughout the spring, but developed a saddle sore mid-season that ended his hopes for a second consecutive title on home turf in Spain. However, this curse is considered to be minimal since Freire had been world champion twice before this and was not stricken by the curse before the 2004 season when he was world champion for the third time.\n\nIn August 2004 British professional cyclist David Millar was suspended for two years by British Cycling, stripped of his 2003 World Time Trial Championship jersey, and given a fine, after confessing to the use of EPO in 2001 and 2003.\n\nOn 24 September 2006, Italian Paolo Bettini won the rainbow jersey in the World Road Race Championship in Salzburg, Austria. Eight days later on 2 October his older brother Sauro died when his car struck an obstacle and overturned into a ditch. He also had a few accidents in the beginning of 2007 season (Tirreno–Adriatico) and technical problems (in E3 Prijs Vlaanderen his chain snapped). Bettini would manage to defend his world championship title in 2007, though.\n\nOn 26 November 2006, while wearing the rainbow jersey of World Madison Champion, Isaac Gálvez died during the Six Days of Ghent, following a horrific crash into the upper barrier surrounding the indoor track.\n\nThe 2008 World Road Champion Alessandro Ballan was diagnosed with Cytomegalovirus near the beginning of the 2009 season, and as a consequence missed the spring's classics and the Giro d'Italia, his home tour. As a result, he was in poor form for that year's Tour de France, and only made a proper appearance once, on stage 19 when he unsuccessfully broke away near the end of the stage.\n\n2012 World Road Champion Philippe Gilbert had a poor season wearing the jersey. He won only one stage in the stripes.\n\n2013 World Road Champion Rui Costa was diagnosed with Bronchitis during 2014 Tour de France and had to rest for most of the August.\n\nIn 2015 an article by epidemiologist Thomas Perneger examining the curse was published in \"The BMJ\". The study was based on statistical analysis of the results of World Road Champions and winners of the Giro di Lombardia (which was used as a comparison) in the riders' winning seasons and for the two years afterwards (to enable comparison of results before, during and after the supposed curse was in effect). The patterns of data were compared to four statistical models - the \"spotlight effect\", based on the theory that the apparent curse is due to increased public attention on the World Champion rather than a decline in success, the \"marked man\" hypothesis which stipulates that the current wearer of the jersey is more closely marked by rivals during their year as champion, the \"regression to the mean\" model which supposes that random variation in success rates will mean that a highly successful season for a rider is likely to be followed by less successful years, and a model combining the last two theories. The study found that the regression to the mean model was the one that fit the data best, for winners of both the World Championship and Il Lombardia, concluding that the curse probably does not exist. The author related the idea of the curse to medical professionals conflating correlation with causation when considering the effect of treatment on a patient.\n\nIn 2017 the curse continued with Peter Sagan - he was disqualified from the Tour after a collision with British sprinter Mark Cavendish, thereby losing out on a chance to tie Erik Zabel's record of six consecutive green jersey victories in what was an otherwise successful season (detailed below). \n\nEddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond each won the Tour de France wearing the rainbow jersey.\n\n2010 world champion Thor Hushovd won two stages of the 2011 Tour de France. His first stage win in the race, stage 13, is considered to be his best win of his career as it was a tough mountain stage and Hushovd originally is a sprinter. He also wore the yellow leaders jersey for 7 straight days.\n\n2011 world champion Mark Cavendish won 13 stages, the Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne and the GC at the Ster ZLM Toer.\n\nBelgian Tom Boonen won the world road race in 2005 then rode the jersey to victory in 12 individual stages, the Tour of Flanders and the overall at the Tour of Qatar.\n\n2015 world champion Peter Sagan won 9 stages, the European Championship road race, three WorldTour classics (including the Tour of Flanders) and his fifth Tour points classification in succession, then went on to successfully defend his world title. The following season, he won 9 stages, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec and an unprecedented third consecutive world title.\n\nIn the past, each discipline had its own variation of the jersey. Since the 2016 Cyclo-cross Worlds, the 'classic' jersey without symbols (previously reserved for the road race and paracycling road race) was assigned to all disciplines.\n\nRainbow jersey colors have been used unofficially by triathlon, speed skating and Crashed Ice world champions.\n\n"}

{"id": "1876609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876609", "title": "Caterham", "text": "Caterham\n\nCaterham () is a town in the Tandridge District of Surrey, England. The town is administratively divided into two: Caterham on the Hill, and Caterham Valley, which includes the main town centre in the middle of a dry valley but rises to equal heights to the south. The town lies close to the A22, from Guildford and south of Croydon, in an upper valley cleft into the dip slope of the North Downs. Caterham on the Hill is above the valley to the west. Due to its proximity to London, Caterham is a commuter town, with small-to-medium-sized businesses of its own but relatively few business/industrial parks. It has some retail and restaurants in Caterham Valley as well as pubs dotted throughout.\n\nAn encampment on the top of White Hill, in Caterham Valley south of Caterham School, between Bletchingley and the town centre is called \"The Cardinal's Cap\" which was excavated and inspected in designating it a Scheduled Ancient Monument. With close ramparts forming two or more lines, archaeologists describe the fort as a \"large multivallate hillfort at War Coppice Camp\". \nThe town lies within the Anglo-Saxon feudal division of Tandridge hundred.\n\nCaterham's church of St Lawrence is of Norman construction and retains a rector as its incumbent. In the reign of King John, Roger son of Everard de Gaist gave this including its church lands to the monastery of Waltham Holy Cross. Everard's grandfather was Geoffery of Caterham who gave land to his son in the 12th century. This monastery ran the glebe as a manor, receiving a grant of free warren in their demesne lands of Caterham in 1253; holding it until the dissolution of the monasteries.\n\nCaterham's original village centre consisted in the nearest part of the ridge of Caterham on the Hill to the railway station in Caterham Valley, including at the street ascending the relatively steep, short hill, Church Hill. Although no conservation area has been designated in either civil parish, four secular buildings, including The King and Queen public house, three churches as well as a vault and tomb in St Lawrence's churchyard are listed; these are along Hill Street/ Church Hill in Caterham on the Hill.\n\nPorkele had been formerly included in the manor given to Waltham Abbey; together the latter manors comprised . Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1402–1460) held these manors leaving them in 1458 to his third son John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire when his son died without issue in 1499, under the terms of grant the elder branch, the following Duke of Buckingham inherited. His heirs sold them on the dissolution to Lord Berners who died in debt in 1533 resulting in bona vacantia and seizure by the Crown. In 1570 Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (as Lord Buckhurst, later Lord High Treasurer, held the 'manor of Caterham and Portele farm,' which he conveyed in that year to Henry Shelley; Sir Thomas's Sondes's widow leased the lands in 1599 to her half-brother, Main Plot seditionist Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. Then in 1615 her daughter Frances Leveson gave the rest of that lease, due the tenant's attainder to Sir Edward Barrett and Walter Barrett while the reversion was held by Sir Richard Sondes. George Ede purchased this massive estate in 1612 and it passed to Jasper Ockley in 1616. Sir Isaac Shard who was one of two Sheriffs of the City of London in 1730 who conveyed it to Thomas Clark and then passed as with the other manors; in 1911 W. L. Williams its owner lived at Portley in what remained of the estate. De Stafford School in Caterham on the Hill occupies a small part of the estate and is named after the earlier known owner. Adjoining Sunnydown School, state-run, is at what was Portley House and is for secondary education for boys with a Statement of Special Educational Needs.\n\nThe only manor did not have as high-profile owners. In 1339 John de Horne released some land Caterham (and more in Warlingham) to Roger Salaman, who at his death in 1343 was \"seised of a tenement\". A manor of Salmons appears in 1605 by William Jordan, who soon afterwards acquired the second manor of Caterham (see above) with which Salmons afterwards descended. It was bought out of Chancery, into which it went on the death of Charles Day, by George Drew, who sold to members of the Horne family, who owned the relatively small estate in 1911.\n\nIn 1544, the King granted the main rectorial manor was granted (in fee) to William Sackville JP In 1553 William Sackville and Eleanor passed the manor to Robert Hartopp, goldsmith of London, dying two years later succeeded by Elias his son, who was left it to his nephew John, whose widow Joan sold the manor in 1609 to George Evelyn who gave it to his son Sir John Evelyn on his marriage to Elizabeth Cocks. Later owners of the manor were Sir John's purchaser James Linch, his issue including Susan Hussey and her son James who sold the manor in 1699 to George Roffey. His nephew inherited it of the same name and in 1770 his sons sold the title alone and perhaps house to Matthew Robinson. Richard Hewetson bought it in 1780 passing it to his nephew Henry Hewetson holding until the Regency period. Henry's nephew William Hewetson ceased to lay claim to any manorial rights however in any event the lands had been separately sold to Henry Rowed, whose son Henry settled the estate on his wife Susan Glover in 1765. Their daughter Katherine Glover inherited these lands.\n\nA second manor Manning and Bray report on was the main tenant's under the monastery and was held by for example buyers: William Jordan in 1607; Sir Isaac Shard (see above), who held his first court in 1726; after 1825 Charles Day of the firm of Day & Martin held but leaving no clear heirs this estate ended up in the hands of the chancery. Taxing (costs) judge George Henry Drew held the main lands and title followed by W. L. Williams in 1911.\n\nUnder Rev. James Legrew in the early 19th century the church tithes were commuted for £400, retaining a glebe of .\n\nIn 1840 Caterham contained a total of 477 residents (figures taken from that census, compiled in an 1848 topographical encyclopedia) and in 1848 of its were common land. Similar to today, mostly steeper acres were woodland.\n\nThe more modern locality of Caterham Valley in a wide dry valley opening to the north (to Warlingham) and along its slopes is a product of the Victorian age and the coming of the Caterham railway line in 1856, which is still a terminus.\n\nVictorian expansion of the town required the building of a much larger parish church, leading to the Church of St Mary the Virgin's building in 1866, directly across the road from St Lawrence's. As it also grew Caterham Valley gained its own Anglican church, to St. John the Evangelist, which was consecrated in 1882.\n\nFrom 1877 Caterham Barracks on the hill was a depot for the footguards regiments. The barracks were closed in 1995 and the site was redeveloped for housing.\n\nTwo main streets (there is only one road called High Street - Caterham on the Hill) therefore serve two very close yet substantial and affluent communities (see demographics), one with the railway station and more modern buildings, one with more historic buildings as soon as the closest hill (to the northwest) is climbed from the heart of Caterham Valley. This set-up means that localism is present in that the Godstone Road during the middle of the 20th century bypassed Caterham Valley staying high and using Tillingdown, along the east of Caterham Valley from St John's School to the Croydon Road roundabout, thereby removing A22 traffic, while businesses set up and thrived in the valley itself.\n\nOn 6 July 1974 PC John Schofield was shot and killed while on patrol in Caterham.\n\nIn 1975 an IRA bomb exploded in the Caterham Arms public house injuring 10 off-duty soldiers and 23 civilians. The pub was popular with the Welsh Guards, who had recently returned to Caterham Barracks after serving in Northern Ireland. The men responsible for the bombing were later jailed for a string of murders and bombings; they were released in April 1999 following the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe North Downs Way, a National trail popular with walkers, passes very close to the town and is readily accessible from either Harestone Valley Road or Tupwood Lane, the Celtic hillfort promontory of the Downs mentioned above, \"The Cardinal's Cap\", and \"Fosterdown or Pilgrims' Fort\", a London Defensive Fort at the top of part of the ridge forming Godstone Hill, in Caterham Valley.\n\nSurrey County Council, headquartered in Kingston, elected every four years, has two councillors from Caterham. \nCaterham has 10 representatives on Tandridge District Council, headquartered in Oxted:\nCaterham has two civil parish councils: Caterham on the Hill and Caterham Valley. Caterham Valley parish has two wards, Harestone and Caterham Valley, each electing three elected parish councillors. The parish council clerk is Maureen Gibbins. Caterham on the Hill has three wards, Portley, Queen's Park and Westway, each electing three parish councillors. The parish council clerk is Helen Broughton.\n\nBefore 1889 Caterham was the most eastern market town of a Surrey that stretched north to Southwark. North eastern parts of the county were absorbed gradually, in part by the County of London in 1889 (to South Norwood and Wimbledon which as a result have London Postcodes) and then to towns and villages within the present boundaries that form Greater London in 1965. From 1885 Oxted and Godstone developed from villages to towns. Tandridge District formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of Caterham and Warlingham urban district along with Godstone Rural District.\n\nCaterham is from the county town of Guildford and south of London.\n\nCaterham on the Hill is located on a considerable area of upland extending north past adjoining Kenley Aerodrome to Kenley and Hartley Hill in Reedham. This elevated area carries on west until Hooley/Old Merstham and forms a very narrow, fairly steep ridge south of Caterham Valley's centre; east of the centre of Caterham Valley are marginally higher rolling pastures of the North Downs on top of a more crevassed smaller mass of upland which forms the village of Woldingham followed by a much larger area of upland stretching from Biggin Hill to Downe and Knockholt, Kent.\n\nThe M25 motorway (between junctions 6 and 7) is 80 to 90m below and less than 200m south of the North Downs path and the southern border of Caterham Valley civil parish and is linked by an uninterrupted hilltop dual carriageway to the north of Caterham and its lowest point, Croydon Road roundabout.\nIn the south of Caterham are the following hills:\n\nElevations range from the height above in the southwest extreme at \"Whitehill Tower, War Coppice Road in Caterham Valley\" to 110m Above Ordnance Datum along the railway track, immediately below Croydon Road roundabout, a tripoint partly in Woldingham, Whyteleafe and Caterham.\n\nCaterham lies within the North Downs and Caterham Valley's southern border is immediately south of the North Downs Way, part of a national trail network, which is here on top of the southern edge of the North Downs.\n\nSoil here has the expected shallow, lime-rich soil over chalk or limestone of the escarpment with lower parts of the escarpment summit here, where the topsoil has eroded, having slightly acid, loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage, which makes that soil particularly fertile.\n\nThe gault clay and the middle chalk that lies under the North Downs are both at their thickest around the valley that occupies the centre of Caterham Valley. While earlier cretaceous clays and greensand and sandy material, underlying, is evident where terrain has eroded, 90 million years ago the North Downs hard chalk was deposited, a white limestone comprising over 95% calcium carbonate. It contains thin beds of marl and nodules of flint, either scattered or in bands. The North Downs extending from Farnham to Dover are formed by this chalk. They now have an often white, almost vertical south-facing slope. In lower slopes flints washed up by early seas come more to the surface and appear closer to the surface.\n\nThe civil parish of Caterham Valley has the more developed shopping area presenting the main town centre for the whole community and has a population of 7,581.\nThe parish church of St. John the Evangelist was consecrated in 1882. The railway station is a terminus in the central, dry valley at the heart of this very large neighbourhood. Traffic to and from the London and Croydon to the north heading towards the M25 motorway is routed around the town on the A22 over the Caterham Bypass, opened in 1939 as one of the earliest such roads in the country. Caterham School is a large independent co-educational day and boarding school situated along the sides of the Harestone Valley. North Downs Hospital is small private establishment on the outskirts of the town run by the Ramsay Health Care UK. Caterham Valley is represented by a business improvement district, which is publicly known as Caterham Valley For You.\n\nCaterham on the Hill is the second of the two civil parishes. This clustered development or village is directly to the northwest of the other entire Valley part of the town and does not have steep slopes or a wide divide between upland and downland developments unlike Caterham Valley. It has a population of 11,555; it was the original development in the area so has more listed buildings compared to Caterham Valley, which has a few early Victorian outlying homes and its church listed. The only state run secondary school is in this part of the town, but it has two private primary schools.\n\nThe Caterham Barracks Trust run some facilities at the site of the former Caterham Barracks. The site is occupied by a supermarket, a housing estate and various leisure facilities, including an arts centre and ball pit (The Arc) an (wittily called Skaterham) housed in the former Guard's chapel.\n\nTerry Waite and David Stirling (the founder of the SAS) trained at the barracks.\n\nA number of films / TV series were fully or partially filmed at the barracks. \"They Were Not Divided\" filmed by Two Cities Films and \"\" series filmed by the BBC.\n\nCaterham Asylum, later known as Caterham Mental Hospital and later still as Saint Lawrence's Hospital, was a very large establishment for the treatment of the mentally ill. Patients came from all over London to this well known institution that by 1930 grew to over 2,000 beds. Joey Deacon lived in the hospital or its grounds for over 50 years. Most of the site has now been redeveloped as housing but a few buildings remain, although they are now empty and planning permission has been given for the buildings to be demolished and 161 homes built on the site. Joey Deacon's bungalow 'Holland House' is scheduled for demolition but the 'Blue Peter' bungalow 'Woodview' is to remain as a care home.\n\nCaterham on the Hill has its own small NHS hospital, Caterham Dene, run by First Community Health and Care CIC offering a range of inpatient and outpatient services, including a minor injury unit.\n\nAt the 2011 census, Caterham has a total population of 21,090 people among 8,543 households, an increase of 130 households in 10 years.\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\nThe proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).\n\nChurch Walk Shopping Centre is a small shopping mall situated opposite Caterham railway station in Caterham Valley. Church Walk was built on the site of the Valley Hotel, which was demolished in 1988. Long before the Valley Hotel was built (to cater for visitors arriving on the new railway trains) there used to be a tennis court, croquet lawn, rose garden, fountain, and Mr. Woollet's nursery.\n\nCaterham Cars, makers of the Caterham 7 sports car no longer have a presence in the town - having moved to Crawley in February 2013. The building that they occupied has now been turned into more homes for retired people.\n\nThe house building company, Croudace, have their head office in Caterham. Caterham and DeStafford Schools and several supermarket chains are also large local employers. The Town had a large vacant building - The Rose and Young building - which has now been demolished after over twenty years. This site is being developed into another Supermarket and more flats, however worked has currently stopped as the developer has liquidated.\n\nSmaller specialised businesses include a Saddler, est 1988 known as Unicorn Leather Saddlery.\n\nThe High Street, on The Hill, has a variety of small, independent shops. Parking is free for three hours in the main car park, at the top end of town.\n\nCaterham railway station is the modern terminus of the 1856-built Caterham Line from Purley. Trains operate into London Victoria station and London Bridge station.\n\nEight bus routes operate through Caterham, with half being operated by Metrobus. They run buses from Caterham to places such as East Grinstead, Croydon, Redhill and Oxted. Of the remaining four routes, buses are run by: Quality Line to Old Coulsdon; Abellio London to Sutton; Arriva London to Addington Village; and Southdown PSV to East Grinstead.\n\nCaterham has a youth football club. Caterham Pumas FC. The Old Caterhamians Rugby Football Club, was established in 1928. Caterham Cricket Club previously played in Queen's Park and now share facilities with the rugby club. Caterham Sea Cadets, formed in 1942, also participate in a number of watersports activities.\n\nCaterham Pumas Football Club play their matches at Joliffe Playing Field. They have youth football teams for children under six to those under eighteen, and two adult teams.\n\nCaterham has a mixture of state and private schools. Three private schools in Caterham are Caterham School, which is in the outskirts of the town, Oakhyrst Grange School and Essendene Lodge School. The main state secondary school is de Stafford School. A secondary school for boys with special educational needs called Sunnydown School is also in Caterham on the Hill.\n\nA children’s ball pit and gymnastics centre are situated in the old Caterham Barracks housing estate. The building is made out of the two converted gymnasiums. There is a skatepark called \"Skaterham\" in Caterham on The Hill. It has indoor and outdoor sections, built on the grounds of the former Guards Chapel.\n\nBased in the town centre the Miller Centre is a theatre and community centre that puts on regular non-professional shows, films and is host to a number of clubs and community groups.\n\nThe small East Surrey Museum houses a local history collection.\n\nAn annual carnival is held in the town, with a procession of floats and a fete.\n\nCaterham has an online radio station for the community, called Ridge Radio.\n\nThe first Caterham Festival was in 2009 and by 2014 there were 135 events spread over 5 weeks. There is a 2-day music fest, the high Street is closed for a town street party and the main road through the Valley is closed for a food fest. Other events include Shakespeare plays, an archaeological dig, open Caterham - where buildings and groups open their doors for the weekend, concerts and comedy nights. The annual Carnival takes place during the Festival.\nThe Festival has won a number of awards including the Action for Market Towns best community event and, on three occasions, the Surrey Mirror Heart of the Community award. Chairman Andy Parr has been awarded the M.B.E. for services to the Community of Caterham.\n\nThe committee members have also advised many other towns about holding similar Festivals.\n\nCaterham has churches representing a variety of Christian denominations. The oldest church remaining in use is the church of St. Lawrence, which was established around 1095. The church has been used by several different denominations, including Quakers and Romanian Orthodox. It was largely replaced from 1866 onwards, following the consecration of the church of St. Mary the Virgin. Both of these churches are located in Caterham on the Hill.\n\nAs the town in the valley expanded after the railway was built, several churches were founded. Caterham United Reformed Church was built by nonconformists in 1863, followed by the Church of St. John the Evangelist in 1881.\n\nThe television presenter Angus Deayton grew up in Caterham; he attended both Oakhyrst Grange and Caterham Schools. Notable sportspeople from Caterham include the footballers Nicky Forster and David Price and cricketer Dar Lyon, all of whom were born in the town. Actors Bill Nighy and Jon Finch were also born in Caterham; Michael Robbins, another actor, died there.\n\n\n"}

This marriage eventually failed, and she started an affair with Adolf Placzek, a Viennese art historian 12 years her junior. She married him as her second husband, 5 years before her death.\n\nHer final years were marked by severe depression, leading to a five-month stay in a psychiatric hospital. Following a mastectomy for breast cancer, she died of cancer in New York in 1953 at the age of 52. Her ashes are buried beside her father in the family grave at St. John The Evangelist Church, in Whitchurch.\n\nJan Struther is the great-aunt of Ian Maxtone Graham, former co-executive producer of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nStruther is the subject of a biography, \"The Real Mrs. Miniver\", written by her granddaughter, Ysenda Maxtone Graham.\n\nIn the 1930s she started to write for \"Punch\" magazine, and this brought her to the attention of \"The Times\" newspaper, where Peter Fleming asked her to write a series of columns for the paper, about \"an ordinary sort of woman who leads an ordinary sort of life – rather like yourself\". The resulting character that she created, Mrs Miniver, proved a huge success from the character's inception in 1937, and the columns were subsequently published in book form in 1939. On the outbreak of war, this book became the basis for a patriotic and sentimental American film, \"Mrs Miniver\", released in 1942, which won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nBy 1942, Struther had herself gone to America as a lecturer. In the 1940s she was a frequent guest panelist on the popular American radio quiz show \"Information Please\", where she provided a warm and witty presence. She was one of the few women panelists to appear repeatedly on the program. An apocryphal story, attributed to fellow panelist Oscar Levant, tells that her appearances on the show stopped abruptly after she answered a question by referring to Agatha Christie's book \"Ten Little Niggers\", which was the original British title of the book \"Ten Little Indians\" (later retitled \"And Then There Were None\"). However, the episode of \"Information Please\" in which Struther used the original Christie title in her answer to a listener question was in fact broadcast February 7, 1941, while the majority of Struther's appearances on the show (at least eight more occasions) occurred after this incident, through January 29, 1945.\n\nAs well as the creation of the character Mrs Miniver in a fortnightly column in \"The Times\", she is remembered for her hymns for children, including \"Lord of All Hopefulness\", \"When a Knight Won His Spurs\" and \"Daisies are Our Silver\". These resulted from an approach by Canon Percy Dearmer of Westminster Abbey, Words Editor of the enlarged edition of \"Songs of Praise\" published in 1931 by OUP. She herself was an agnostic, although she did go to church.\n\n\n"}

He is the son of Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan, grandson of Fateh Ali Khan and the nephew of legendary Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nRahat displayed an adoration for music from a very young age and was often found to be singing with his uncle and father, as young as three.\nFrom an age of seven, he was already being trained by his uncle Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in the art of singing Qawwali.\n\nRahat performed publicly for the first time, when he was nine, at the death anniversary of his grandfather. Since he was fifteen, he was an integral part of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's well-known qawwali group and toured the UK with his uncle in 1985. He also performed solo songs at different concerts, in addition to fulfilling his roles in the \"Quawalli group\".\n\nHe debuted as a playback singer in Bollywood with the movie \"Paap\" (2003), in the song \"Mann Ki Lagan\".\n\nIn April 2012 Rahat toured in the UK, performing at Wembley Arena and the Manchester Arena, playing to a combined audience of over 20,000 people and creating a record of maximum ticket-sales.\n\nThe song \"Zaroori Tha\" from the album \"Back 2 Love\" (2014) became the first original non-film music video from the Indian subcontinent to cross 100 million views after two years, and 200 million views within three years of its release. He is also touring with Leo Twins from Nescafé Basement on a regular basis.\n\nIn a subordinate role with his uncle Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, working in collaboration with Eddie Vedder, of the American rock band, Pearl Jam, Rahat contributed to the soundtrack of the 1995 Hollywood film, \"Dead Man Walking\". In 2002, he worked on the soundtrack of \"The Four Feathers\" in collaboration with the American composer of orchestral and film music, James Horner. In 2002, Rahat guested with The Derek Trucks Band on the song \"Maki Madni\" for Trucks' album, \"Joyful Noise\". In 2006, his vocals were featured on the soundtrack of Mel Gibson's \"Apocalypto\".\n\nHe judged the show, \"Chhote Ustaad\" alongside Sonu Nigam. He was also one of the judges on the singing reality show \"Junoon\", premiered on NDTV Imagine in 2008.\n\nRahat became the first Pakistani to perform at any Nobel Prize concert, when he was invited to the concert at 2014 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. He performed Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's most memorable qawwali \"Tumhe Dillagi\" and \"Mast Qalandar\", and he also sang \"Aao Parhao\" there.\n\nRahat has appeared in four seasons of the Pakistani musical show \"Coke Studio\".\n\nHe first appeared in season 1, where he collaborated with singer Ali Azmat for the track \"Garaj Baras\". He then collaborated with Abida Parveen in season 6 for \"Chhaap Tilak Sab Chheeni\".\n\nIn season 9, he sang \"Afreen Afreen\" along with Momina Mustehsan which has garnered more than 300 million views on YouTube, becoming the first Pakistani song to cross that mark. He collaborated with Amjad Sabri for \"Aaj Rang Hai\", which was the final performance of the latter, prior to his assassination on 22 June 2016.\n\nHe appeared in Coke Studio Pakistan (season 10) where he performed \"Sayonee\" with Ali Noor and a solo number called Rangreza.\n\nRahat had appeared in \"MTV Unplugged\" (India) in 2016.\n\nIn 2018 daughter of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan said she intended to take legal action against copyright infringement of singers who sing her father's songs. To this Rahat responded saying he was the adopted successor of Nusrat and doesn't need anyone's permission to sing his songs. In January 2019, Khan was accused of smuggling foreign currency and summoned by the Enforcement directorate of Government of India.\n\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Lux Style Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|ARY Film Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Hum Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Pakistan Media Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|UK Asian Music Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Filmfare Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|IIFA Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Screen Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Producers Guild Film Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Mirchi Music Awards\n! style=\"background:#bfd7ff\" colspan=\"4\"|Others\n\nOn 26 June 2019 Rahat was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the University of Oxford.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1876702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876702", "title": "Kà", "text": "Kà\n\nKà is a show by Cirque du Soleil at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. \"Kà\" describes the story as \"the coming of age of a young man and a young woman through their encounters with love, conflict and the duality of \"Kà\", the fire that can unite or separate, destroy or illuminate.\"\n\nIn its review, the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated it \"may well be the most lavish production in the history of Western theater. It is surely the most technologically advanced.\" The \"New York Times\" highly praised all the technical aspects and costumes, but felt that it did not succeed in a particularly compelling story, rather it was \"essentially about the kind of wild physical feats that all Cirque shows are about, their jaw-dropping effect multiplied by the huge dimensions of the theatrical space.\" The show has been seen by more than one million spectators since its opening in February 2005.\n\nCreated and directed by Robert Lepage, \"Kà\" began show previews on November 26, 2004 and the show premiered on February 3, 2005. Kà was the first Cirque du Soleil show to encompass a cohesive storyline. The show's title, Kà, is inspired by the ancient Egyptian belief in the \"Kà,\" an invisible spiritual duplicate of the body that accompanies every human being throughout this life and into the next.\n\n\"Kà\" is the first Cirque du Soleil production that deviates from the company's usual format—the production presents a more straightforward story, unlike the more abstract visuals presented by other Cirque productions. The show and the theater cost $165 million to develop.\n\n\"Kà\" lacks a conventional stage with a permanent floor; instead, two giant moving platforms and five smaller lifts and platforms appear to float through a bottomless space. A narrow boardwalk separates the audience from a deep abyss where the stage floor would normally be. From the stage level of the boardwalk up to the high grid is , and the pit drops below, amounting to a total of some 15 stories from the highest ceiling grid to the lowest floor level. The opening width and depth of the performance area are each . This enormous performance space is reconfigured with each scene change by the complex movements of the show's lifts and platforms.\n\nThe largest moveable platform employed in the show, the Sand Cliff Deck, measures and weighs 50 tons. A vertical gantry crane supports and controls the Sand Cliff Deck, lifting the platform up and down , rotating it 360 degrees and tilting it from flat to 100 degrees. This is attached to four hydraulic cylinders that run along two support columns. The Sand Cliff Deck is equipped with show and work lights, circular elevators to bring performers in and out, 80 'rod actuators' that sprout from the floor surface to enable performers to climb it when it is tilted vertically, and video projection tiles that allow computer-generated images to appear on the floor of the deck. In one scene, the entire deck is covered with of imported granular cork from Portugal which creates the realistic appearance of a beach.\n\nThe second largest platform, the Tatami Deck, is a cantilevered platform located upstage of the Sand Cliff Deck. It weighs , and slides in and out like a drawer to provide a horizontal stage and carry massive set pieces such as the Wheel of Death.\n\nThese two decks can appear alone or together or simply disappear from view; they can move in front of, behind, above or below each other.\n\nThe theater and stage were designed by British architect Mark Fisher; the structural design and engineering of the stage platforms was by the New York City engineering firm McLaren Engineering Group, owned and operated by Mal McLaren. The torsion tube, wrist, and arm assembly for the Sand Cliff deck were built by Timberland Equipment, a company that normally builds mining equipment.\n\nIn 2008, the unique floating stages earned \"Kà\" the prestigious Thea Award for Outstanding Technical Achievement from the Themed Entertainment Association.\n\n\"Kà\" combines complex automation, pyrotechnics, puppetry, and multimedia projections that help immerse the audience in the story.\n\nThe \"Kà\" theater, which has a capacity of 1950 people, is equipped with a total of 4774 loudspeaker drivers in 2139 cabinets: a pair of speakers at ear level in every seat and hundreds more strategically placed around the auditorium. The digitally mixed audio system routes an intricate mix of sound effects and music to these speakers to create a very dynamic surround-sound audio experience. Sound effects can be targeted, manipulated and customized to any of 16 seating zones.\n\nThe multimedia projection in the show utilizes both infrared video motion detecting as well as a system of touch-sensitive panels beneath the surface of the main 'Sand Cliff' deck. This allows the system to track the location of individual performers and change the video content accordingly. A similar example of the infrared portion of this technology can be seen in some movie theater lobbies where people can step on and burst video projected bubbles.\n\nKà takes safety very seriously in the form of technical implementations as well as training. Such areas include power sources, fire precautions, falling, harness equipment, and other such items among many others. As an example, many performers wear earpieces during the show in order to hear cues when they can perform various stunts safely.\n\nDue to the speed in which artists fall from the decks, an array of airbags had to be used in lieu of traditional nets alone. These airbags sit atop two nets, which at times are below the point the artist begins the fall. The airbags contain individual cells which can inflate and deflate independently. In case a power outage occurs, each airbag has its own uninterruptible power supply which can last up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe sandcliff deck has pegs built into it which are used during the \"Climb\" scene. Each peg has a sensor which will not allow it to shoot out from the deck if something is blocking its path. These pegs shoot out at a speed of , simulating arrows striking the surface. Likewise, each peg can only retract with less than of pressure. Thus if someone were hanging off of it, the peg would stay in place. If something were to go wrong with the deck, a set of backup pegs are in place which can be utilized as a safety ladder to allow performers to exit the deck safely.\n\nAs for the aerial rigging system which allows performers to perform tricks in the air while harnessed, it too has safety features. If a harness or wire were to fail, a fail-safe mechanism is in place which would lower the performer to the stage or in the aisles to safely detach from the cabling system.\n\nAs the Kà theatre is inside the MGM, it too is integrated into the building's fire suppression system. During the show, stage managers must contact hotel security and ask that the fire officer override the fire detection equipment in the theatre during the duration of any pyrotechnic and fire stunts.\n\nOn June 29, 2013, cast member Sarah \"Sasoun\" Guyard-Guillot, an acrobat from Paris, France, died after she fell about 94 feet from the show's stage at MGM Grand. She was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada where she died. It was the first reported death from an accident onstage in Cirque du Soleil's 30-year history.\nIt was the second time in less than a week that a Cirque show on the Strip was halted for an accident involving one of its artists; a performer in one of the final preview performances of \"Michael Jackson One\" at Mandalay Bay suffered a mild concussion after slipping through the slack rope in the show’s “Stranger in Moscow” scene, missing the protective pad below the act and landing hard upon the stage. The performer was expected to return to the show.\nTwo artists in \"Zumanity\" at New York-New York were seriously injured in an onstage fall in November 2007.\n\nA team of over 300 people make up the production team for \"Kà\", ranging from technicians to support staff. Eighty people from this team comprise the on-stage artists and performers.\n\n\nThe choreography incorporates several types of acrobatics and martial arts, including fight scenes using the Wushu style of martial arts, Chinese opera, Poi for manipulating staves and batons, Brazilian Capoeira dance, bungees, aerial straps, swing poles, and a wheel of death.\n\n\"Kà\" is a story about \"conflict and love\", of \"imperial twins who are separated at the prime of their youth and must undergo a rite of passage of self-discovery. It is about their encounters with \"Kà\", the fire that has the dual power to destroy or illuminate.\"\n\nUnlike other Cirque du Soleil performances, \"Kà\" offers four pre-shows. Once the house opens, guests are greeted by the villagers of \"Kà\" (better known as the “Gatekeepers\"). Twenty minutes before curtain, two musicians enter the lobby and climb up to two stringed instruments specially designed for \"Kà\" and integrated into the architecture. Ten minutes before the show, actors appear in the metal framework to the left and right of the stage and perform flips and leaps assisted with ropes to dive into the audience and attempt to scare viewers. Five minutes before showtime, a staged act informs the audience that there is no flash photography or cell phone usage allowed.\n\nThe story is told in a total of fourteen scenes, each of which is preceded by movement of one or more of the massive stage elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian visual iconography was the inspiration for many of the costumes in \"Kà\": this can be seen in the imperial court and martial artists wardrobes. The Twins, for instance, have very lavish silk costumes which draw inspiration from orientalist painters from Japan, Korea, and India.\n\nCirque du Soleil utilized a new type of digital screen printing in order to design many costumes for \"Kà\", examples of which can be seen in the Forest People, Archers, and the Counselor's Son. The Forest People's costumes rely on printing the performers' body definitions onto the actual fabric to enhance the appearance of making their skin actually look like it is truly blue and green. Inspiration was drawn from the African Maasai warriors' ritual scar markings. As for the Archers, skin-toned Tactel was selected and tattoo designs were printed on it to make the Archers' tattoos look truly realistic. They also have moulded rubber toes attached to their shoes, giving the appearance that they are barefoot. Tattooing techniques used for the Archers were also applied to the Counselor's Son. In addition, a ripped piece of kilt is superimposed on his costume; this was made by using \"shibori\" (a Japanese tye-dyeing technique).\n\nThe crab puppets seen in the beach scene each took approximately 1,300 hours to create.\n\n\"Kà\" features an off-stage band that accompanies the acting, acrobatics, and singing that takes place on stage. During various portions of the show, different musicians make appearances in the show, performing in costume directly on the stage. The vocals in \"Kà\" are provided by a mezzo-soprano(played by Rochelle Collins) and an alto(played by Lizzy Munson).\n\nOriginally, \"Kà\"'s score was to be composed by Benoit Jutras. However, he left the show because of creative differences, and the music of \"Kà\" was composed by René Dupéré, who has composed music for multiple other Cirque productions, including \"Mystère\" at Treasure Island, and Cirque's touring production of \"Alegría\".\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Kà\" was released on the 18th of October, 2005. In addition to the original score, the soundtrack features several 'inspired by' tracks. Although the album is somewhat remixed, most of the content remains faithful to the show.\nCo-produced, arranged and engineered by Martin Lord-Ferguson, the \"Kà\" soundtrack features a symphonic orchestra of 57 musicians conducted by Hollywood veteran Simon Leclerc and a choir of over 50 singers conducted by Jean-Sebastien Allaire, making \"Kà\" Cirque du Soleil's most \"ambitious recording to date.\" The album features the voices of Élise Velle (René Dupéré's wife), Ella Louise Allaire (vocalist, arranger and vocal coach) and a young soprano boy named Philippe Lapan-Vandal. In addition, the 'inspired by' tracks, with the exception of \"If I Could Reach Your Heart\" (performed by Élise Velle), feature the voice of Canadian world artist Nitza Melas.\n\nThrough the music of \"Kà\", René Dupéré attempts to provoke various emotions and moods such as drama, emergency, serenity, passion, and even \"the birth of love\". Dupéré describes the music with an \"African flavor\" and states that he wants the audience to feel that the show is \"full of energy\". He says that the music is not intended to sound as though it belongs to a specific time frame. \"It could be from medieval times or even 200 years in the future...the music itself is ageless.\"\n\nThe tracks on the Kà soundtrack, followed by the scenes to accompany the songs are listed below.\n\n\nSongs in the show that are not on the soundtrack album:\n\n\nCirque du Soleil and Marvel Entertainment teamed up to adapt \"Kà\" through a limited four-part series of collectible comic books. Created by comic book writer Bryan J.L. Glass, artist Wellinton Alves and colorist Jean-Francois Beaulieu, these comics follow the heroic journey of the Imperial Twins, separated by war, who encounter adventure and peril at every turn on their quest to reunite their kingdom. The first installment debuted at the Marvel booth at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con on July 12 – 15, then a wide release followed into comic book stores and a digital download version with subsequent issues to come.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1876704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876704", "title": "Perl control structures", "text": "Perl control structures\n\nThe basic control structures of Perl are similar to those used in C and Java, but they have been extended in several ways.\n\nIn the following, \"label\" is an optional identifier terminated by a colon, and \"block\" is a sequence of one of more Perl statements surrounded by braces. All looping constructs except for the C-style codice_1-loop can have a codice_2 block that is executed after each iteration of the loop body, before the loop condition is evaluated again.\n\nThis is the so-called C-style codice_1 loop. The first expression is evaluated prior to the first loop iteration. The second expression is evaluated prior to each iteration and the loop is terminated if it evaluates to false. The third expression is evaluated after each iteration, prior to deciding whether to perform the next. This codice_1 loop is the only looping construct that can not have a codice_2 block, but \"expr3\" is functionally equivalent.\n\nIn codice_6, \"var\" is a scalar variable that defaults to codice_7 if omitted. For each element of \"list\", \"var\" is aliased to the element, and the loop body is executed once. The keywords codice_1 and codice_6 are synonyms and are always interchangeable.\n\nThe codice_10 loop repeatedly executes the loop body as long as the controlling expression is true. The condition is evaluated before the loop body. codice_11 is similar, but executes the loop body as long as the condition is false.\n\nThe \"label\" \"block\" construct is a bit of an oddity: Perl treats a bare block – with or without a label – as a loop that is executed once. This means that the loop control keywords can be used to restart the block or to exit it prematurely; a bare block can also have a codice_2 block.\n\nPerl provides three loop control keywords that all accept an optional loop label as an argument. If no label is specified, the keywords act on the innermost loop. Within nested loops, the use of labels enables control to move from an inner loop to an outer one, or out of the outer loop altogether. The loop control keywords are treated as expressions in Perl, not as statements like in C or Java.\n\n\n if ( \"expr\" ) \"block\"\n\nwhere \"block\" is a sequence of one of more Perl statements surrounded by braces.\n\nThe controlling expressions are evaluated in a boolean context: The numeric value 0, the strings \"\" and \"0\", and the undefined value codice_19 are false, all other values are true. This means that the strings \"0.0\", \"00\", \"-0\", and \"0 but true\" are all true, even though their value would be converted to 0 in a numeric context; values like these are sometimes used when a successful operation needs to return 0.\n\nEvaluating an empty array in scalar context yields codice_19, which is false. Therefore, the following example prints \"a is empty\":\n\nPerl also provides variants of the loop and conditional constructs that work on a simple statement (an expression evaluated for its side-effects) instead of a block:\n\nThe codice_10 and codice_11 modifiers test the controlling expression before executing the statement, just like their loop counterparts. However, they are not considered actual loops, so the loop control keywords codice_13, codice_15 and codice_17 cannot be used with them. They have special semantics when combined with the codice_26 keyword:\n\nIn these constructs, the condition is tested after the block is executed, so the block always executes at least once.\n\nThese modifiers cannot be nested, so the following is illegal\n\nand should be written as one of:\n\nThere are two forms of goto in Perl:\nand\nThe first form is generally deprecated, and is only used in rare situations. For example, when attempting to preserve error status in codice_27, some modules will use goto like this:\n\nopen(A, \"<\", $filea) or goto fail;\nopen(B ,\">\", $fileb) or goto fail;\nprint B <A> or goto fail;\nclose A or goto fail;\nclose B or goto fail;\nreturn 1;\nfail: $reason = \"In copy: $?\"; return 0;\n\nThe second form is called a tail call, and is used to enhance the performance of certain kinds of constructs where Perl's default stack management would perform non-optimally. For example:\n\nsub factorial {\n\nThis form is also used to create aliases for subroutines with minimal overhead. This can help reduce \"Out of Memory\" errors (or high memory usage in general) found often in repeating the same subroutine.\n"}
{"id": "1876706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876706", "title": "Les Cités obscures", "text": "Les Cités obscures\n\nLes Cités obscures (literally The Obscure Cities, but initially published in English as Cities of the Fantastic) is a graphic novel series set on a Counter-Earth, started by the Belgian comics artist François Schuiten and his friend, writer Benoît Peeters in the early 1980s. In this fictional world, humans live in independent city-states, each of which has developed a distinct civilization, each characterized by a distinctive architectural style.\n\nThe full series is available in most Western European languages (in French and Dutch by Casterman, in German, Spanish, and Portuguese by local publishing houses) and other French speaking countries (in francophone Canada by Editions Flammarion).\n\nWhile the first five books of the series had been published in English by NBM Publishing, they discontinued publishing the series in 2008, with the editions going out of print.\n\nAfter a successful kickstarter campaign in mid 2013, Alaxis Press (an imprint of Atomic Vision Entertainment, Inc. and named after the \"sulphuric\" \"Obscure City\" of Alaxis) were able to fund a complete official English-language edition of \"The Leaning Girl\" (1996; volume 6 of the official series) and \"Leaning Mary\" (1995; spin-off picture book). \"The Leaning Girl\" is slated for release in February 2014, with \"The Theory of the Grain of Sand\" to follow in November 2015. \"The Leaning Girl\" received a 2015 Eisner Award nomination as \"Best U.S. Edition of International Material\".\n\nAlaxis Press has also stated that they plan to release the rest of the untranslated books (including all rare spin-off materials), before going back and releasing new editions of the books previously released by NBM Publishing. In 2016, Alaxis partnered with renowned and larger comic publisher IDW Publishing to give the new English-language editions a further reach, with IDW becoming the effective new North-American publisher to the series, with the original staff of Alaxis still involved.\n\nSchuiten's graphic representations and architectural styles within \"Les Cités obscures\" is, among other historical themes, heavily influenced by Belgian Art Nouveau architect Victor Horta, who worked in Brussels at the turn of the 20th century. An important motif is the process of what he calls \"Bruxellisation\", the destruction of this historic Brussels in favor of anonymous, low-quality modernist office and business buildings. Coming from a family of architects, Schuiten had many relatives, especially his father and brothers, who were instrumental in \"Bruxellisation\", an important part in Schuiten's and Peeters' 1950s childhood memories of the city. Schuiten was brought up to study architecture by his father, both in university and early on at home, while young Schuiten preferred to pursue his escape to the world of Franco-Belgian \"bandes dessinées\" such as those he found in \"Pilote\" magazine that his older brother introduced him to, with René Goscinny, Morris, and André Franquin among his early favorites.\n\nAround 1980, having become an emerging established graphic novel artist who had made himself a name publishing in \"Métal Hurlant\" and creating a number of standalone albums, Schuiten began drafting a parallel world of vintage architectural splendor reflecting his childhood memories of Brussels, a world which can be reached primarily through remaining buildings of these times gone by. In an ongoing attempt to prevent the spread of knowledge of this parallel world, mostly faceless authorities in our world increasingly have these buildings torn down, and in Schuiten's world this was the true reason for chaotic, headless \"Bruxellisation\" where functional and organic buildings were destroyed in favor of ill-planned, useless, and confusing structures such as ill-planned roads, detours, freeways, and anonymous office buildings that destroyed the organic fabric of a city and resulted in dysfunctional traffic and living routines.\n\nApproaching his friend Peeters, who by now had become a comic writer, about this imaginary world, Peeters infused his own philosophical ideas into plot lines he developed for the project, and in 1982 the first \"Les Cités obscures\" album, \"Les murailles de Samaris\", began publication as a serial in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"À Suivre\". Requiring a few revised editions of the early albums, the basic tenets and elements of \"Le monde obscure\" were laid down since the late 1980s.\n\nVarious commentators, as well as Schuiten himself, have identified visual and theme influences in \"Les Cités obscures\" from as diverse works as those by Jules Verne, Winsor McCay, Franz Kafka, René Magritte, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Victor Horta, and Henry Fuseli.\n\nThe stories of the \"cités obscures\" appear in a series of graphic novels and related books, published by Casterman. Most of them remain unpublished in English, whereas those six published in English (first in serialized form in \"Heavy Metal\" and Dark Horse Comics' \"Cheval Noir\", then as complete albums by NBM Publishing) so far often had different cover design and page size. The books published in French so far below:\n\n\nBeside these \"official\" parts to the story, Schuiten and Peeters also collaborated, partly with other authors, on a number of works that were not originally linked to the series but that were set in similar settings, were linked to it later, and/or highlighted particular aspects of the \"Obscure World\" without being a traditional narrative.\n\n\nThe volume \"Voyages en Utopie\" (2000) presents the ongoing and completed work carried on by these two authors, in parallel with the \"Cités obscures\" series. Another book Schuiten and Peeters collaborated on in reference to \"Les Cités obscures\" is \"Les Portes du Possible\" (2005).\n\nThe world (or \"continent\", according to the authors) of the \"Cités obscures\" forms a disparate grouping of cities located on a \"counter-Earth\", which is invisible from our Earth because it is situated exactly opposite it on the other side of the Sun. Still, travel between the two worlds is possible by means of \"gates\" (\"portes\") called \"Obscure Passages\", which are mostly to be found in buildings and constructions similar or identical to each other on both planets, whereas the distinct architectural style of a structure makes it a potential candidate to harbor an \"Obscure Passage\" to an \"Obscure City\" whose distinct style it resembles.\n\nIt is not uncommon for some Earthlings and inhabitants of the \"Cités obscures\" to actually come across each other (among the most notable of these travelers may be noted Jules Verne, a recurring personage in the series). On websites such as \"Web of the Obscure Cities\" (which is no longer online but is documented on AltaPlana.be, an online encyclopaedia for \"Obscure Cities\") and \"Office of the Obscure Passages\", Schuiten and Peeters present alleged reports, often illustrated with photos and drawings, from people that shortly crossed over into the world of the \"Obscure Cities\" via \"Obscure Passages\" by accident, and by so-called \"Obscurantists\" who have been seeking for \"Obscure Passages\" for years (compare \"Obscurantist\", a term based upon the \"Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum\", aka \"Letters of Obscure Men\"). These reports on the internet correspond to the pseudorealism of Schuiten and Peeters when enclosing \"authentic\" documentary or amateur CDs (\"Le Musée A. Desombres\", 1990) or DVDs (\"L'affaire Desombres\", 2002) to their print publications regarding the \"Obscure Cities\".\n\nBenoît Peeters had collaborated with director Raoul Servais before on a documentary entitled \"Servaisgraphia\" on Servais's unique animation style that was released in 1992. Subsequently, there is a loose connection between the increasingly multimedia series of the \"Obscure Cities\" and the Belgian fantasy film \"Taxandria\" (1994) directed by Servais (starring, among others, Armin Mueller-Stahl), where Schuiten served as production designer. In the \"Obscure Cities\" series, at times characters refer to the vanished city-state of Taxandria which was accidentally removed from the planet during a failed scientific experiment.\n\nA common theme in steampunk-influenced \"Les Cités obscures\", Taxandrian clothing and technology appear to resemble Victorian times on our earth, Taxandria's architecture is reminiscent of Schuiten's trademark phantasmagorical architectural fantasies, and another feature the film shares with \"Les Cités obscures\" is a bloated absurd, Kafkaesque bureaucracy. It is however under dispute among fans of the series whether Taxandria is truly one of the \"Obscure Cities\" due to a perceived appearance of a light-hearted children's fantasy movie to Servais's film.\n\nA reinterpreting graphic novel adaptation of the movie \"Taxandria\" was published by Schuiten and Peeters one year prior to the film's official release under the title \"Souvenirs de l'Eternel Présent: Variation sur le Film \"Taxandria\" de Raoul Servais\" (Arboris, 1993, , ), also including production background information on the film.\n\nSchuiten and Peeters increasingly seek to transcend their world of the \"Obscure Cities\" from graphic novels into other media to create an entire universe, even though their comic albums remain the core foundation of Schuiten and Peeters's emerging multimedia franchise.\n\nThis trend for multimedia expansion began with the book \"Le Mystère d'Urbicande\" (1985) which marked the series' acquiring a life of its own and whereby Schuiten and Peeters began to realize the true potential of their concept. Written by Belgian author and \"Obscure\" fan Thierry Smolderen (under the pseudonym \"Professeur R. de Brok\"), \"Le Mystère d'Urbicande\" purports to be a scientific essay bent to debunk the events of \"La fièvre d'Urbicande\", heavily annotated in emotional handwriting by Eugen Rodick, the main character of \"La fièvre d'Urbicande\" who is now locked up in Brüsel's Sixth Hospice, the city's mental asylum. Schuiten contributed the book's illustrations under the pen-name \"Robert Louis Marie de la Barque\" (whereas the French word \"barque\", meaning \"barge\" or \"rowboat\" in English, translates to \"schuiten\" in Dutch).\n\nDrafting and developing stages of the above-mentioned film \"Taxandria\" and its accompanying graphic novel adaptation began between Schuiten and Peeters as early as 1988.\n\nIn 1990, the development was further explored with \"Le Musée A. Desombres\", an audio CD with a small booklet drawn by Schuiten, purporting to be an exhibition catalogue of paintings by Auguste Desombres, an artist living in our world in the late 19th century. The CD contains an audio play that is partly a fake report from Desombres's first exhibition, partly chronicles Desombres crossing over into the world of the \"Obscure Cities\" by accident by means of his own exhibition.\n\nIn 2002, Schuiten and Peeters published the DVD \"L'affaire Desombres\", a sequel to \"Le Musée A. Desombres\".\n\nA setting of \"La fièvre d'Urbicande\", cult album in the Obscure Cities series, appears in the 2012 Canadian science fiction movie \"Mars et Avril\" by Martin Villeneuve, based on the graphic novels of the same name. As a matter of fact, François Schuiten agreed to have a 3D model made out of his futuristic auditorium, for a scene taking place inside the Temple of Cosmologists. The director had this image in mind when writing his books, a few years before Schuiten joined the team as production designer. Before the shooting, even the extras were chosen to look like the characters in the comic book.\n\nIn 1996, \"Urbicande.be\", the official website of the \"Obscure Cities\" went online where Schuiten and Peeters encouraged their fans all over Europe to send in their own ideas regarding the \"Obscure Cities\" and accounts of their own experiences in search for \"Obscure Passages\". The response was so overwhelming that Schuiten and Peeters were able to expand their online activities into a complex network of sites, mainly branching from the URL \"ebbs.net\" of their official \"Obscure\" magazine called \"Obskür\", where many amateur reports, illustrated by photos and Schuiten's drawings, and various mysterious \"Obscure\" artifacts can be found. Along with these, a number of conspiracy theories are explored, regarding authorities of our world intending to prevent the spread of knowledge regarding the parallel world and destroy various \"Obscure Passages\". In May 2015, \"Urbicande.be\" was taken offline and archived at \"AltaPlana.be\", an official online encyclopaedia of the \"Obscure Cities\" universe.\n\nAfter having colorfully satirized the destructive modernizing fad of \"Bruxellisation\" in the \"Les Cités obscures\" album \"Brüsel\" in 1992, Schuiten and Peeters convinced the community of Schuiten's childhood district Schaerbeek to acquire one of the last remaining buildings in Brussels built by Art Nouveau architect Horta, \"La maison Autrique\", and in 1999 opened a permanent pseudo-documentary exhibition inside, regarding the \"Obscure Cities\", 19th century Art Nouveau Brussels, and detailing its ongoing \"Bruxellisation\" destruction during the 20th century, tying in with aforementioned conspiracy theories whereby \"Bruxellisation\" is supposed to be an attempt by the authorities to destroy a number of \"Obscure Passages\" situated in Brussels. In 2004, Schuiten and Peeters published the illustrated book \"La Maison Autrique: Métamorphose d'une maison Art Nouveau\" (published as \"Maison Autrique - Metamorphosis of an Art Nouveau House\" in English) about the building, its restoration during the 1990s, and Horta's life and work. Also, their latest \"Les Cités obscures\" two-part graphic novel album \"La Théorie du grain de sable\" (2007; 2008) deals with the \"maison Autrique\".\n\n\n\nCaution: All official sites by Schuiten & Peeters below treat the \"Obscure Cities\" from a strictly perspective (for example, all of their works related to the series are called \"accounts\" or \"chronicles\" rather than fiction stories).\nOfficial website for the English-language market:\n\n"}

Although plans for a highway connecting Hamilton to Fort Erie south of the Niagara Escarpment have surfaced for decades,\nit was not until \"The Niagara Frontier International Gateway Study\" was published by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) in 1998 that serious examination and planning began. The study called for an alternative route to the QEW, which runs through tender fruitlands and is not capable of expansion beyond its current configuration. The land on which studies are being performed for this future freeway is referred to as the Mid-Peninsula Corridor or the Niagara–GTA Corrdior.\n\nAs proposed, the Mid-Peninsula Highway would connect Highway 403 in Hamilton with a twinned Peace Bridge in Fort Erie. North of Hamilton, it would curve and meet Highway 407 or Highway 401 north of Burlington. The entire freeway would be above the Niagara Escarpment in consideration of the wine-producing fruitlands that lie at its base; a consideration that was ignored during the construction of the QEW despite the protests of farmers.\n\nConnections with the southward extension of Highway 406 would be provided near Welland, as well as with the controlled-access section of Highway 6 north of Caledonia, where the freeway would pass near John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. The majority of the route west of the Welland Canal would travel north of the former Highway 20.\n\nThe successive Ontario Conservative governments of Premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves planned to forego a full environmental assessment of the freeway after a study indicated an urgent need for its construction. \"The Niagara Frontier International Gateway Study\" was published by the MTO in 1998 and indicated that the freeway was of vital importance. Prior to this study, various proposals for a freeway above the Niagara Escarpment had surfaced for several decades, though no serious examination of its merits was undertaken.\n\nHowever, with the election of the Liberal government under Dalton McGuinty in 2003, a formal study was initiated. After developing the \"Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe\", the McGuinty government launched a new \"Niagara to GTA corridor\" environmental assessment to study transportation needs in the corridor.\n\nA draft Transportation Development Study to consider alternative or complementary infrastructure to a freeway was completed in February 2011. The study recommended the routing be split into three groups, with route planning to commence for the eastern portion, further corridor study in the western portion and to halt but otherwise continue monitoring needs for a new transportation link in the central portion. As a result of the study, the Regional Municipality of Niagara has initiated an environmental assessment to identify and design a new 400-series highway freeway Highway 406 and the QEW, forming the eastern portion of the Mid-Peninsula Highway. Corridor planning has the support of the provincial government.\n\n"}

The railroad also operates a line formerly operated by Conrail, Penn Central, Pennsylvania Railroad from Wallington to Newark to interchange with CSX's ex-Conrail Chicago Line. Early operations included runs to Sodus Point, where Genesee Brewing Company maintained a malt house operation until 1986 when the building closed. \n\nThe Marion Branch (former Newark & Marion Railway) was operated to serve cold storage warehouses, packing operations and a fertilizer dealer in Marion. Declining traffic and poor track conditions led to the end of its operation in July 1984.\n\nDuring 1982 and 1983, a dinner train operation was operated out of Webster using privately owned equipment and OMID crews. For a number of years until 2004, the OMID operated fall foliage excursions between Sodus and Newark in conjunction with the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum, which owns the former New York Central \"Empire State Express\" coach cars used for the trips.\n\nIn 1993, Ontario Midland severed its corporate partnership with the Ontario Central Railroad (ONCT).

{"id": "1876793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876793", "title": "Sea Bird", "text": "Sea Bird\n\nSea-Bird (1962–1973) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a career which lasted from 1964 until October 1965 he ran eight times and won seven races. Sea Bird is most famous for his victories in two of Europe's most prestigious races: the Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. His Timeform rating of 145 remains the second highest flat figure behind Frankel's rating of 147 awarded by that publication.\n\nSea-Bird was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred at the stables of his owner, the Lille textile manufacturer Jean Ternynck. Sea-Bird was sired by the French Derby runner-up Dan Cupid, and trained, like his sire, in France by Etienne Pollet at Chantilly. None of his five immediate dams ever won a flat race, although his great-grandam Couleur did produce Camaree, who won the 1000 Guineas in 1950, and Sea Bird was more distantly related to the Belmont Stakes winner High Echelon.\n\nIn France, the horse was known as Sea-Bird, a spelling followed by many modern writers. When racing abroad and standing at stud he was usually referred to as \"Sea Bird II\". He was referred to as \"Sea-Bird II\" by Timeform.\n\nSea-Bird started in three races as a two-year-old, winning his first two, the Prix de Blaison at Chantilly by a short head (started slowly) and the Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte by two lengths from Blabla (who won the Prix de Diane the following year). He met with the only defeat of his career in the Grand Critérium when second to his stablemate Grey Dawn, who was the favourite after winning the Prix Morny and the Prix de la Salamandre. Sea-Bird started slowly, as he had done in his two wins, but made up a great deal of ground in the straight to finish second, two lengths behind Grey Dawn. Maurice Larraun, Sea-Bird's jockey, appeared to have given the horse too much to do and never rode Sea-Bird again. At the end of the season, Sea-Bird was rated three pounds inferior to Grey Dawn by the official French handicapper.\n\nAs a three-year-old, Sea-Bird won all five starts, starting with a three-length win in the Prix Greffulhe. He next appeared in the Prix Lupin, which he won by six lengths from Diatome.\n\nIn The Derby, Sea-Bird started at the 7/4 favourite in a field of twenty two. There was an incident the night before the race in which police and security staff repelled a gang which had attempted to enter the stable of the 2000 Guineas winner Niksar. Before the race, Sea-Bird was described as looking \"plain and high\". He raced on the outside behind the leaders until the turn into the straight and then moved up to take the lead on the bridle with Glennon sitting \"still as a statue\". Sea-Bird won effortlessly by two lengths, never coming off the bit, from Meadow Court, who went on to win the Irish Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, with I Say in third. In July, Sea-Bird ran in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, which he won, easing down, by two and a half lengths from Couroucou. He was then rested until the autumn.\n\nIn the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Sea-Bird faced a very strong field, including Irish Derby winner Meadow Court, Preakness winner Tom Rolfe, French Derby (Prix du Jockey Club) winner Reliance, Prix de Diane winner Blabla and Russian Derby winner Anilin. Starting at odds of 6/5, Sea Bird won easily despite veering across the track, with jockey Pat Glennon patting him down the neck in the final 100 yards, by six lengths (though photographs of the finish show it to have been closer to four and a half lengths) from Reliance. Five lengths further back in third place was Diatome (though photographs show it to have been closer to four lengths), who went on to win the Washington, D.C. International. Fourth place went to Free Ride, fifth was Anilin and sixth was Tom Rolfe.\n\nSea-Bird was given an annual rating of 145 by Timeform in 1965. This remained the highest rating awarded by the organisation until Frankel's performance in the 2012 Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot was rated 147.\n\nDespite having run only once in the United Kingdom, Sea-Bird was voted British Horse of the Year by the Racegoers' club in 1965, taking 228 of the 240 votes.\n\nIn their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sea-Bird the greatest racehorse of the 20th century, one pound ahead of Secretariat and two pounds ahead of Ribot and Brigadier Gerard.\n\nPrior to the running of his final race, the American breeder John W. Galbreath paid owner Jean Ternynck a reported $1,350,000 to lease Sea-Bird for five years' stud duty at his Darby Dan Farm in Kentucky. Among Sea Bird II's progeny were the dual French classic and 1974 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winning mare Allez France (who had a Timeform rating of 136, making her still, according to that publication, the highest ever rated middle distance racemare); the 1974 Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner Little Current; the Champion Hurdle winner Sea Pigeon; and Gyr, second in the 1970 Epsom Derby behind the English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky II. Sea-Bird sired Reine Enchanteur, who sold for a then-world-record $405,000 at the 1968 Keeneland Sales, as well as the dams of King's Swan, who was known as the \"King of Aqueduct\", Miss Oceana, a millionaire in racing who sold as a broodmare for a world record US$7 million, and the half brothers Assert, the French Derby and Irish Derby winner, and Bikala, who won the French Derby. Sea Bird was also the grandsire (through his son Arctic Tern) of the French Derby winner Bering.\n\n\n"}

She became a project coordinator in 1999, before she left Littlewoods in 2001, when she was appointed director at the Merseyside Centre for the Deaf.\n\nShe was a member of the Liverpool Health Authority and held the position of vice chair between 1994 and 1996. In 1996, she became Chair of Liverpool Women's Hospital.\n\nShe has also acted as a trustee of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.\n\nCooper was elected, aged 22, to the Liverpool City Council as a Liberal councillor in 1973 and, in 1992, became the Lord Mayor of Liverpool; she stood down from the city council in 2000.\n\nShe fought her first Westminster campaign at the 1983 General Election when she was selected to contest the Conservative-held seat of Liverpool Garston where she finished in third place, with more than 14,000 votes behind the winner Eddie Loyden.\n\nNext, Cooper contested the 1986 Knowsley North by-election, caused by the resignation of the Labour MP Robert Kilroy-Silk to become a television presenter. At the by-election, Labour retained the seat with George Howarth gaining a comfortable margin of 6,724 votes, and when she contested the seat again a few months later at the 1987 General Election she finished 21,098 votes behind Howarth.\n\nAt the 1992 General Election, now a Liberal Democrat, she was back in her native Liverpool, coming second at Liverpool Broadgreen 7,027 votes behind Labour's Jane Kennedy, but ahead of the former deselected Labour MP Terry Fields.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1984, Cooper was councillor for the Broadgreen ward. From 1986 to 2000, Cooper represented the Aigburth ward, before in 1999 she switched to the Labour Party, and stood in Netherly ward in 2000.

In September 2005, Cooper, as part of the Labour Friends of Israel, made an official research visit to Israel.\n\nSince 2005, she has been a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, and was part of the successful campaign that stopped the merger of the Southport and Ormskirk hospitals. In June 2006, she became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Rooker, a Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nOn 9 August 2006, \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote that Cooper had written to the Prime Minister's office reporting the viewpoint of some of her constituents expressed to her, that they would be appalled if Baroness Thatcher were to be given a state funeral, as a leader more politically divisive than others of the late twentieth century.\n\nIn 2007, she became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ben Bradshaw, initially when he was Minister of State in the Department of Health until 2009, when she remained his PPS when he was made Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. She is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Health Select Committee.\n\nIn August 2013, she became one of the few Labour MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which eventually passed with cross-party support.\n\nOn 26 October 2017, a 31-year-old man, Christopher Lythgoe, associated with the proscribed neo-Nazi terror group National Action, was charged with encouragement to murder Cooper, and was also charged along with six other men with being members of a proscribed organisation, contrary to section 11 of the Terrorism Act 2000. \nOn 12 June 2018, Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, admitted in a guilty plea to buying a 48 cm (19 in) replica Roman Gladius sword (often wrongly referred to in the media as a machete) to kill Rosie Cooper the previous summer.

This is because the Northern Ndebele people of Zimbabwe descend from followers of the Zulu leader Mzilikazi (one of Zulu King Shaka's generals), who left the Zulu Kingdom in the early 19th century, during the Mfecane, arriving in present-day Zimbabwe in 1839.\n\nAlthough there are some differences in grammar, lexicon and intonation between Zulu and Northern Ndebele, the two languages share more than 85% of their lexicon. To prominent Nguni linguists like Anthony Cope and Cyril Nyembezi, Northern Ndebele is a dialect of Zulu. To others like Langa Khumalo, it is a language. Distinguishing between a language and a dialect for language varieties that are very similar is difficult, with the decision often being based not on linguistic but political criteria.\n\nNorthern Ndebele and Southern Ndebele (or Transvaal Ndebele), which is spoken in South Africa, are separate but related languages with some degree of mutual intelligibility, although the former is more closely related to Zulu.

{"id": "1876866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876866", "title": "Schöllenen Gorge", "text": "Schöllenen Gorge\n\nSchöllenen Gorge () is a gorge formed by the upper Reuss in the Swiss canton of Uri between the towns of Göschenen to the north and Andermatt to the south. It provides access to the St Gotthard Pass.\n\nEnclosed by sheer granite walls, its road and railway require several spectacular bridges and tunnels, of which the most famous is a stone bridge known as the \"Teufelsbrücke\" (\"Devil's Bridge\").\n\nThe lower Urseren marks the boundary of the Aar massif with the autochthonous sediment of the Gotthard nappe (\"Urseren-Zone\"). In Altkirch quarry, on the southern end of the gorge, Triassic and Jurassic sediments are exposed. In the Schöllenen Gorge (at the \"Urnerloch\" tunnel), the Reuss enters the cristalline Aar massif (Aar granite), the gorge itself being an exemplary late alpine fluvial Water gap.\n\nThe name of the gorge is from Rumantsch \"*scalinae\" (\"stairs, steps\"); recorded in German as \"Schellenden\" in 1420. It formed the upper limit of Alemannic settlement in the Alps prior to the 12th century, and the border between the bishoprics of Constance and Raetia Curensis.\n\nThe gorge appears to have been passable by a difficult footpath by the mid-12th century. This path was forced to avoid the southern part of the gorge, taking a steep ascent from \"Brüggliwaldboden\", climbing above 1,800 m before descending to Hospental via \"Bäzberg\". The eponymous \"scalinae\" presumably referred to steps hewn into the rock to facilitate the ascent.\n\nThe gorge was first opened up as a bridle path with the construction of a wooden bridge in the 1220s. This was of great strategic importance because it opened the Gotthard Pass, with historical consequences both regionally and to the Italian politics of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe original bridle path across Schöllenen was realised by means of a wooden ledger attached to the rock wall, known as \"Twärrenbrücke\", and a wooden bridge across the gorge, recorded as \"stiebende Brugge\" (\"spray bridge\") in 1306. The \"Twärrenbrücke\" (from \"twer\" \"across, athwart\") rested on beams laid across the gorge. A tradition imagining it as supported by hanging chains developed only after its collapse in the 18th century. The technology associated with the construction of the \"Twärrenbrücke\" is attributed to the Walser, who are known to have begun settlement in Urseren still in the 12th century. 16th-century historiography attributes the construction of the bridge to one \"Heini\" (Heinrich), blacksmith in Göschenen. Robert Schedler published a historical novel surrounding the construction of the Schöllenen bridle path, \"Der Schmied von Göschenen\", in 1919.\n\nIn Early Modern Switzerland, a legend developed which attributed the construction of the bridge to the Devil. This is a motif attached to numerous old bridges in Europe (see Devil's Bridge for a comparative account). The name \"Teiffels Brucken\" (\"Devil's Bridge\", modern German: \"Teufelsbrücke\") is first recorded in 1587.\n\nThe legend is related by Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1716). According to Scheuchzer, he was told a local legend according to which the people of Uri recruited the Devil for the difficult task of building the bridge. The Devil requested to receive the first thing to pass the bridge in exchange for his help. To trick the Devil, who expected to receive the soul of the first man to pass the bridge, the people of Uri sent across a dog by throwing a piece of bread, and the dog was promptly torn to pieces by the Devil. Enraged at having been tricked the Devil went to fetch a large rock to smash the bridge, but, carrying the rock back to the bridge, he came across a holy man who \"scolded him\" (\"der ihn bescholten\") and forced him to drop the rock, which could still be seen on the path below Göschenen. A modern retelling was published by Meinrad Lienert, \"Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten\" (1915). According to Lienert's version, a goat was sent across the bridge instead of a dog, and instead of the holy man, the Devil, when he was taking a break exhausted from carrying the rock, came across an old woman who marked the rock with a cross, forcing the Devil to abandon it and flee.\n\nThe legend does not appear to have existed before the 16th century, and its origin in local tradition is uncertain. Lauf-Belart (1924) surmised that the name \"Teufelsbrücke\" was originally due to an erroneous interpretation by learned travellers, which only in the 17th century gave rise to the local legend involving the Devil. \n\nThe Devil's Stone (\"Teufelsstein\") is a large block of granite near Göschenen, with a height of c. 12 m and a mass of c. 220 tons. In 1887, it was sold to the \"Maestrani Schweizer Schokoladenfabrik\" for 80 francs. Painted yellow, it now served as an advertisement for chocolate. In 1923, there were plans to demolish it, but it was preserved on the initiative of Max Oechslin, president of \"Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri\". In 1970, the Devil's Stone was again scheduled for destruction, to make way for the N2 motorway. This time, there was a broad movement to preserve it, and in 1971, federal authorities agreed to move the stone, with projected costs of 250,000 francs (of which the canton of Uri was to contribute 7,000). This led to a popular campaign opposing the plan because the cost was seen as excessive. The liberal newspaper \"Gotthard-Post\" proposed to spend the money on the construction of a retirement home instead, collecting 1,000 signatures in support. The cantonal government now argued that there was no legal basis for the destruction of the stone because it had been the property of \"Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri\" since 1925. On 1 September 1972, the Federal Council finally agreed to moving the stone, and it was moved 127 metres in an operation costing CHF 335,000. It is now situated on the ramp of exit 40 (Göschenen) of the motorway, at the entrance of Gotthard Road Tunnel, visible both from the railway and from the motorway.\n\nThe wooden bridge \"Stiebender Steg\" was replaced by a stone bridge in 1595, which came to be known as Devil's Bridge (\"Teufelsbrücke\").\n\nOn St Patrick's Day (17 March) 1608 Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone was fleeing the English with 98 of his fellow-Gaels when, crossing the Devil's Bridge, one of the horses carrying his fortune plunged into the torrent below; the horse was recovered, but not the gold, which was lost in the raging torrent.\n\nA new road, including a tunnel with a length c. 60 m, replacing the \"Twärrenbrücke\" was built in 1707/8. The tunnel, known as \"Urnerloch\", was the first road tunnel to be built in the Alps. It was constructed by Pietro Morettini (1660–1737). Following its construction, the \"Twärrenbrücke\" was no longer maintained and allowed to collapse.\n\nH. R. Schinzin in 1783 mentions another bridge, marking the border between Uri and Urseren, known as \"Mittelbrücke\" or \"Tanzenbein\".\n\nIn 1799, it was the site of one of the most dramatic battles of Suvorov's Italian and Swiss expedition during the Napoleonic Wars. The bridge was heavily damaged by the retreating French army. As a result, the route's trade with Italy shifted to the Splügenpass. The Suvorov monument, just south of the Devil's Bridge, was commissioned by the Russian Empire in 1899.\n\nA replacement cut stone bridge was planned and executed by Karl Emanuel Müller (1804-1869), the cantonal engineer in charge of the stretch of the new Gotthard road between Göschenen and Hospental. Construction took 10 years, and was the subject of a famous painting by Karl Blechen in 1830-32. The new bridge allowed (single-lane) motorized traffic, opening the Gotthard Pass to automobiles. The 1595 bridge fell out of use after the completion of the second bridge in 1830, and it collapsed in 1888.\n\nThe Gotthard railway project of 1872 avoided the Schöllenen Gorge by building the Gotthard Rail Tunnel under it, but the Schöllenenbahn, a rack railway, was built through the gorge in 1917. The modern road bridge and tunnel date to 1958. It served as the main road across the Central Alps during the 1960s and 1970s, but since the construction of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 1980 it has only been of regional importance, connecting Uri with canton of Valais and the Surselva.\n\n"}

It is a left tributary of the river Lütschine. It flows through the village Saxeten and joins the Lütschine in Wilderswil. It forms a narrow ravine, the \"Saxetbach Gorge\".\n\nOn 27 July 1999, an accident occurred in Saxetbach Gorge (a gorge close to the village of Saxeten) in which 21 young people from Australia, New Zealand, England, South Africa, and Switzerland died.\n\nForty-eight people from two coach tour parties had elected an optional side event of canyoning. It was organized by Adventure World, a now defunct company located in Wilderswil, not far from Saxeten. At , flash floods began pouring through the gorge and 21 people within the group were swept to their deaths; 18 were tourists and three were canyon guides. By 7 pm, the stories had hit the world news, and the hotels they were staying in were bombarded with phone calls, but the staff knew only what they saw on television.\n\nThe survivors were rescued and then questioned by Swiss Police before being released and returned to their hotel at the next morning. Until then they had no idea how many people had died nor the enormity of the disaster.\n\nIdentifying the dead bodies was a serious problem for the Swiss authorities as the bodies were badly traumatized. Eleven survivors agreed to go to the mortuary to identify the dead, but many victims had to be identified through DNA and dental analysis. Families were desperate to see for themselves what had happened, and Swissair along with Swiss medical services provided meet and greet sessions for families, and also much counseling for those who had been present. Bodies of the dead washed up in Lake Brienz, a popular boating lake, during peak summer tourist season. The bodies were mostly pulled out of the lake by young Dutch tourists who stayed at the nereby campsite. This particular group was going to join an adventure world rafting or canyoning trip this same day, but decided not to go at the last moment. \n\nSince the incident, the press reported many rumors about what happened. Emergency services claim they sent someone to tell the group of the impending storms, and families of the dead claim that the company should have seen the signs of the weather. Swiss authorities were quick to blame profit-seeking and general negligence as the cause of the accident.\n\nAfter the disaster, Adventure World went out of business. Their former premises, near the Wilderswil Station, are now occupied by a bank. In 2001, some of the staff at Adventure World were charged in connection with the deaths. A total of six staff members were found guilty of manslaughter through culpable negligence and given suspended sentences of between two and five months and fined between 4,000 and 7,500 CHF.\n\n"}

An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative , Lazarus won premierships with the Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm, who he also captained. He is the only player in the history of the game to win grand finals with three separate clubs, with the grand final wins also being the first for each club. After his retirement from football he assisted several NRL clubs in a coaching capacity.\n\nIn the 2013 federal election, Lazarus was elected to the Australian Senate for the state of Queensland as the lead Queensland candidate for the Palmer United Party (PUP). He became PUP Senate leader at the commencement of his term on 1 July 2014. He quit PUP on 13 March 2015 citing issues with its leader Clive Palmer, and established his own political party, the Glenn Lazarus Team. He did not retain his seat in the 2016 federal election.\n\nLazarus was born in Queanbeyan, New South Wales. He attended Queanbeyan South Primary School and Karabar High School, Queanbeyan. He excelled at swimming and football, both Australian rules and especially rugby league.\n\nLazarus achieved a formidable reputation in prop forward position at club, state (NSW), and international levels. He was the first player in the history of the game to win premierships with three clubs: Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm. Lazarus was also named Players' Player for two consecutive Kangaroo Tours: 1990 and 1994. In addition, Lazarus scored the first rugby league try at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during a State of Origin game.\n\nLazarus began his first-grade career with the Canberra Raiders in 1987, and was selected to make his debut for New South Wales in the 1989 State of Origin series. He played a starring role in the club's victory over the Balmain Tigers in the 1989 grand final. He travelled with the Raiders to England for the 1989 World Club Challenge, which was lost to Widnes.\n\nLazarus played in the Raiders' victory over the Penrith Panthers in the 1990 grand final. At the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, he went on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. He also played for Canberra in their grand final loss to Penrith in 1991.\n\nIn the summer preceding the 1992 season, Lazarus was recruited from Canberra by his former coach at the Raiders, Wayne Bennett and joined the Brisbane Broncos, with whom he played the largest portion of his career. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, he helped Australia retain The Ashes. He played for the Broncos at prop forward in the 1992 grand final victory over the St. George Dragons, following which he travelled with the Broncos to England, where he played at prop forward in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. He then played for Australia at prop forward in the World Cup final victory over Great Britain at Wembley Stadium.\n\nLazarus played for the Broncos at prop forward in the 1993 grand final victory again over the St. George Dragons. This constituted a remarkable feat of playing in five consecutive grand finals.\nDuring the 1994 NSWRL season, Lazarus played at prop forward for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge and lost. In 1996, he captained the Broncos in a game against the Penrith Panthers due to Allan Langer being injured. He was selected to go on the 1994 Kangaroo Tour, where he was voted the Players' Player of the tour. It was only a broken (dislocated) ankle suffered during a 1997 World Club Championship match that prevented Lazarus from playing in that year's Super League grand-final-winning Brisbane side.\n\nLazarus was recruited to the newly established Melbourne Storm by his former CEO (John Ribot) and teammate (Chris Johns) from the Broncos, both then responsible for setting up and managing the growth of new club in Melbourne. Lazarus commenced with the club in its inaugural year, 1998 and was named as the club's first captain and also given a newspaper column to write in \"The Herald Sun\". He went on to lead the Melbourne Storm at prop forward in their 1999 grand final victory. Lazarus announced his retirement from the game with five premierships for three clubs (Canberra 1989–90, Brisbane 1992–93 and Melbourne 1999).\n\nIn 2000, Lazarus was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. In 2003, he was one of the first four former players inducted into the Broncos' official Hall of Fame. In 2005, the western grandstand of Olympic Park Stadium was named the Glenn Lazarus stand in his honour. Lazarus spent many years coaching junior rugby league in Brisbane. He also assisted the Canberra Raiders and Brisbane Broncos in an assistant coaching capacity.\n\nIn February 2008, Lazarus was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007), which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Lazarus has been 612 ABC Brisbane Breakfast rugby league tipster since 2008. In 2008 New South Wales announced their rugby league team of the century, naming Lazarus at prop.\n\nAt the end of the 2008 Queensland Cup season, Lazarus, who served as assistant coach at the Ipswich Jets club under the departing Kevin Walters, was named as head coach of the club from the 2009 season. Lazarus was not re-appointed for 2011.\n\nLazarus was selected to head the Palmer United Party (PUP) Senate ticket in Queensland at the 2013 federal election and was elected on a 9.89 percent primary vote. He got to the required 14.3 percent quota from a favourable preferential tally from group voting tickets. His term as a PUP Senator commenced on 1 July 2014 and he became PUP Senate leader.\n\nHe announced his resignation from PUP through Facebook on 13 March 2015 and became an independent Senator. He wrote: \"I have a different view of team work. Given this, I felt it best that I resign from the party and pursue my senate role as an independent senator.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Lazarus announced his intention to form his own party. The party, Glenn Lazarus Team, was registered on 9 July 2015. Lazarus and the Glenn Lazarus Team were unsuccessful in the 2016 federal election and did not secure any seats in the Parliament. As this was a double dissolution election, Lazarus' Senate term ended on 2 July 2016. The party was voluntarily deregistered on 14 July 2017.\n\nLazarus is married and has three children.\n\n"}

{"id": "1876910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876910", "title": "Apalachee", "text": "Apalachee\n\nThe Apalachee are a Native American people who historically lived in the Florida Panhandle. They lived between the Aucilla River and Ochlockonee River, at the head of Apalachee Bay, an area known to Europeans as the Apalachee Province. They spoke a Muskogean language called Apalachee, which is now extinct.\n\nThe Apalachee occupied the site of Velda Mound starting about 1450 CE, but had mostly abandoned it when Spanish started settlements in the 17th century. They first encountered Spanish explorers in 1528, when the Narváez expedition arrived. Traditional tribal enemies, European diseases, and European encroachment severely reduced their population. The survivors dispersed, and over time many Apalachee integrated with other groups, particularly the Creek Confederacy, while others relocated to other Spanish territories, and some remained in what is now Louisiana. About 300 descendants in Rapides and Natchitoches parishes assert an Apalachee identity today.\n\nThe Apalachee spoke the Apalachee language, a Muskogean language which became extinct. It was documented by Spanish settlers in letters written during the Spanish Colonial period.\n\nAround 1100 indigenous peoples began to cultivate crops. Agriculture was important in the area that became the Apalachee domain. It was part of the Fort Walton Culture, a Florida culture influenced by the Mississippian culture. With agriculture, the people could grow surplus crops, which enabled them to settle in larger groups, increase their trading for raw materials and finished goods, and specialize in production of artisan goods.\n\nAt the time of Hernando de Soto's visit in 1539–1540, the Apalachee capital was \"Anhaica\" (present-day Tallahassee, Florida). The Apalachee lived in villages of various size, or on individual farmsteads of or so. Smaller settlements might have a single earthwork mound and a few houses. Larger towns (50 to 100 houses) were chiefdoms. They were organized around earthwork mounds built over decades for ceremonial, religious and burial purposes.\n\nVillages and towns were often situated by lakes, as the natives hunted fish and used the water for domestic needs and transport. The largest Apalachee community was at Lake Jackson, just north of present-day Tallahassee. This regional center had several mounds and 200 or more houses. Some of the surviving mounds are protected in Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park,\n\nThe Apalachee grew numerous varieties of corn, pumpkins and sunflowers. They gathered wild strawberries, the roots and shoots of the greenbrier vine, greens such as lambsquarters, the roots of one or more unidentified aquatic plants used to make flour, hickory nuts, acorns, saw palmetto berries and persimmons. They caught fish and turtles in the lakes and rivers, and oysters and fish on the Gulf Coast. They hunted deer, black bears, rabbits, and ducks.\n\nThe Apalachee were part of an expansive trade network that extended from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, and westward to what is now Oklahoma. The Apalachee acquired copper artifacts, sheets of mica, greenstone, and galena from distant locations through this trade. The Apalachee probably paid for such imports with shells, pearls, shark teeth, preserved fish and sea turtle meat, salt, and cassina leaves and twigs (used to make the black drink).\n\nThe Apalachee made tools from stone, bone and shell. They made pottery, wove cloth and cured buckskin. They built houses covered with palm leaves or the bark of cypress or poplar trees. They stored food in pits in the ground lined with matting, and smoked or dried food on racks over fires. (When Hernando de Soto seized the Apalachee town of Anhaico in 1539, he found enough stored food to feed his 600 men and 220 horses for five months.)\n\nThe Apalachee men wore a deerskin loincloth. The women wore a skirt made of Spanish moss or other plant fibers. The men painted their bodies with red ochre and placed feathers in their hair when they prepared for battle. The men smoked tobacco in ceremonial rituals, including ones for healing.\n\nThe Apalachee scalped opponents whom they killed, exhibiting the scalps as signs of warrior ability. Taking a scalp was a means of entering the warrior class, and was celebrated with a scalp dance. The warriors wore headdresses made of bird beaks and animal fur. The village or clan of a slain warrior was expected to avenge his death.\n\nThe Apalachee played a ball game, sometimes known as the \"Apalachee ball game\", described in detail by Spaniards in the 17th century. The fullest description, however, was written as part of a campaign by Father Juan de Paiva, priest at the mission of San Luis de Talimali, to have the game banned, and some of the practices described may have been exaggerated. The game was embedded in ritual practices which Father Paiva regarded as heathen superstitions. He was also concerned about the effect of community involvement in the games on the welfare of the villages and Spanish missions. In particular, he worried about towns being left defenseless against raiders when inhabitants left for a game, and that field work was being neglected during game season. Other missionaries (and the visiting Bishop of Cuba) had complained about the game, but most of the Spanish (including, initially, Father Pavia) liked it (and, most likely, the associated gambling). At least, they defended it as a custom that should not be disturbed, and that helped keep the Apalachee happy and willing to work in the fields. The Apalachee themselves said that the game was \"as ancient as memory\", and that they had \"no other entertainment ... or relief from ... misery\".\n\nNo indigenous name for the game has been preserved. The Spanish referred to it as \"el juego de la pelota\", \"the ballgame.\" The game involved kicking a small, hard ball against a single goalpost. The same game was also played by the western Timucua, and was as significant among them as it was among the Apalachee. A related but distinct game was played by the eastern Timucua; René Goulaine de Laudonnière recorded seeing this played by the Saturiwa of what is now Jacksonville, Florida in 1564. Goalposts similar to those used by the Apalachee were also seen in the Coosa chiefdom of present-day in Alabama during the 16th century, suggesting that similar ball games were played across much of the region.\n\nA village would challenge another village to a game, and the two villages would then negotiate a day and place for the match. After the Spanish missions were established, the games usually took place on a Sunday afternoon, from about noon until dark. The two teams kicked a small ball (not much bigger than a musket ball), made by wrapping buckskin around dried mud, trying to hit the goalpost. The single goalpost was triangular, flat, and taller than it was wide, on a long post (Bushnell described it, based on a drawing in a Spanish manuscript, as \"like a tall, flat Christmas tree with a long trunk\"). There were snail shells, a nest and a stuffed eagle on top of the goalpost. Benches, and sometimes arbors to shade them, were placed at the edges of the field for the two teams. Spectators gambled heavily on the games. As the Apalachee did not normally use money, their bets were made with personal goods.\n\nEach team consisted of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds in an effort to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.\n\nThe origin of the games was the subject of an elaborate mythology. The giving of challenges for a game and the erection of goalposts and players' benches involved rituals and ceremonies, \"superstitions\" and \"sorceries,\" in the view of Father Pavia. The Apalachee expanded the superstitions to include Christian elements; after losing two games in a row, one village decided that was because their mission church was closed during the games. Players also asked priests to make the sign of the cross over pileups during a game.\n\nThe Apalachee had a relatively dense population and a complex, highly stratified society and regional chiefdom. They were part of the Mississippian culture and an expansive regional trade network reaching to the Great Lakes. Their reputation was such that when tribes in southern Florida first encountered the Pánfilo de Narváez expedition, they said the riches which the Spanish sought could be found in Apalachee country.\n\nThe \"Appalachian\" place-name is derived from the Narváez Expedition's encounter in 1528 with the Tocobaga, who spoke of a country named \"Apalachen\" far to the north. Several weeks later the expedition entered the territory of Apalachee north of the Aucilla River. Eleven years later the Hernando de Soto expedition reached the main Apalachee town of Anhaica, somewhere in the area of present-day Tallahassee, Florida, probably near Lake Miccosukee. The Spanish subsequently adapted the Native American name as \"Apalachee\" and applied it to the coastal region bordering Apalachee Bay, as well as to the tribe which lived in it. Narváez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528. \"Appalachian\" is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S. The name and term Appalachia is also linked to the tribe. The Yamasee Tribe had links into the mountain South. It also appears the Apalachee also had such trade and family links farther north, likely linked to Cherokee, Catawba, and other tribes.\n\nTwo Spanish expeditions encountered the Apalachee in the first half of the 16th century. The expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez entered the Apalachee domain in 1528, and arrived at a village, which Narváez believed was the main settlement in Apalachee. Spanish attempts to overpower the Apalachee were met with resistance. The Narváez expedition turned to the coast on Apalachee Bay, where it built five boats and attempted to sail to Mexico. Only four men survived their ordeal.\n\nIn 1539, Hernando de Soto landed on the west coast of the peninsula of Florida with a large contingent of men and horses, to search for gold. The natives told him that gold could be found in \"Apalachee\". Historians have not determined if the natives meant the mountains of northern Georgia, an actual source of gold, or to valuable copper artifacts which the Apalachee were known to have acquired through trade. In any case, de Soto and his men went north to Apalachee territory in pursuit of the precious metal.\n\nBecause of their prior experience with the Narváez expedition and reports of fighting between the de Soto expedition and tribes along the way, the Apalachee feared and hated the Spanish. When the de Soto expedition entered the Apalachee domain, the Spanish soldiers were described as \"lancing every Indian encountered on both sides of the road.\" De Soto and his men seized the Apalachee town of Anhaica, where they spent the winter of 1539–1540.\n\nApalachee fought back with quick raiding parties and ambushes. Their arrows could penetrate two layers of chain mail. They quickly learned to target the Spaniards' horses, which otherwise gave the Spanish an advantage against the unmounted Apalachee. The Apalachee were described as \"being more pleased in killing one of these animals than they were in killing four Christians.\" In the spring of 1540, de Soto and his men left the Apalachee domain and headed north into what is now the state of Georgia.\n\nAbout 1600, the Spanish Franciscan priests founded a successful mission among the Apalachee, adding several settlements over the next century. Apalachee acceptance of the priests may have related to social stresses, as they had lost population to infectious diseases brought unwittingly by the Europeans, to which they had no natural immunity. Many Apalachee converted to Catholicism, in the process creating a syncretic fashioning of their traditions and Christianity. In February 1647, the Apalachee revolted against the Spanish near a mission named San Antonio de Bacuqua in present-day Leon County, Florida. The revolt changed the relationship between Spanish authorities and the Apalachee. Following the revolt, Apalachee men were forced to work on public projects in St. Augustine or on Spanish-owned ranches.\n\nSan Luis de Talimali, the western capital of Spanish Florida from 1656 to 1704, is a National Historic Landmark in Tallahassee, Florida. The historic site is being operated as a living history museum by the Florida Department of Archeology. Including an indigenous council house, it re-creates one of the Spanish missions and Apalachee culture, showing the closely related lives of Apalachee and Spanish in these settlements. The historic site received the \"Preserve America\" Presidential Award in 2006.\n\nStarting in the 1670s, tribes to the north and west of Apalachee (including Chiscas, Apalachicolas, Yamasees and other groups that became known as Creeks) began raiding the Apalachee missions, taking captives who could be traded as slaves to the English in the Province of Carolina. Seeing that the Spanish could not fully protect them, some Apalachees joined their enemies. Apalachee reprisal raids, made in part to try to capture Carolinian traders, pushed the base camps of the raiders eastward, from which they continued to raid Apalachee missions as well as missions in Timucua Province. Efforts were also made to establish missions along the Apalachicola River to create a buffer zone. In particular, several missions were established among the Chatot tribe. In 1702, a few Spanish soldiers and nearly 800 Apalachee, Chatot and Timucuan warriors, on a reprisal raid after several Apalachee and Timucuan missions had been raided, were ambushed by Apalachicolas. Only 300 warriors escaped the ambush.\n\nWhen Queen Anne's War (the North American part of the War of Spanish Succession) started in 1702, England and Spain were officially at war, and attacks by the English and their Indian allies against the Spanish and the Mission Indians in Florida and southeastern Georgia accelerated. In early 1704 Colonel James Moore of Carolina led 50 Englishmen and 1,000 Apalachicolas and other Creeks in an attack on the Apalachee missions. Some villages surrendered without a fight, while others were destroyed. Moore returned to Carolina with 1,300 Apalachees who had surrendered and another 1,000 taken as slaves. In mid-1704 another large Creek raid captured more missions and large numbers of Apalachees. In both raids missionaries and Christian Indians were tortured and murdered, sometimes by skinning them alive. These raids became known as the Apalachee Massacre. When rumors of a third raid reached the Spanish in San Luis de Talimali, they decided to abandon the province. About 600 Apalachee survivors of Moore's raids were settled near New Windsor, South Carolina. Following the Yamasee War the New Windsor band joined the Lower Creek, and many returned to Florida.\n\nWhen the Spanish abandoned Apalachee province in 1704, some 800 surviving Indians, including Apalachees, Chatots and Yemasee, fled westward to Pensacola, along with many of the Spanish in the province. Unhappy with conditions in Pensacola, most of the Apalachees moved further west to French-controlled Mobile. They encountered a yellow-fever epidemic in the town and lost more people. Later, some Apalachees moved on to the Red River in present-day Louisiana, while others returned to the Pensacola area, to a village called Nuestra Señora de la Soledad y San Luís. A few Apalachees from the Pensacola area returned to Apalachee province around 1718, settling near a fort that the Spanish had just built at St. Marks, Florida. Many Apalachees from the village of Ivitachuco moved to a site called Abosaya near a fortified Spanish ranch in what is today Alachua County, Florida. In late 1705 the remaining missions and ranches in the area were attacked, and Abosaya was under siege for 20 days. The Apalachees of Abosaya moved to a new location south of St. Augustine, but within a year most of them had been killed in raids. The Red River band integrated with other Indian groups, and many eventually went west with the Creeks, though others remained, and their descendants still live in Rapides Parish, Louisiana. When Florida was transferred to Britain in 1763, several Apalachee families from mission San Joseph de Escambe, then living adjacent to the Spanish presidio of Pensacola in a community consisting of 120 Apalachee and Yamasee Indians, were moved to Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-seven Indians living near St. Augustine, some of whom may have been descended from Apalachees, were taken to Guanabacoa, Cuba.\n\nIn the years after the United States' Louisiana Purchase, the Apalachees in Louisiana faced encroachment by settlers, and discrimination as a non-white minority, particularly severe after the end of the American Civil War. Under the state's binary racial segregation laws passed at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they were classified as \"colored\" or \"black\".\n\nThe tribe's descendants in Louisiana, known as the \"Talimali Band of Apalachee\", still live in Rapides Parish. Some still live in Chopin, Louisiana, in the hills of the Kisatchie National Forest. In 1997 they started the process of seeking federal recognition but have ceased to seek recognition. Since they have become more public, they have been invited to consult with Florida on the reconstruction at Mission San Luis, invited to pow-wows, and invited to recount Apalachee history at special events. As of 2017 they had two co-chiefs, Arthur and TJ Bennett, sons of the former chief Gilmer Bennett.\n\n\n"}

Formerly erroneously regarded as a dialect of Kildin Sámi, it has recently become recognized as an independent Sámi language that is most closely related to its western neighbor Skolt Sámi.\n\nAkkala Sámi is the most endangered Eastern Sámi language. On December 29, 2003, Maria Sergina – the last fluent native speakers of Akkala Sámi – died. However, as of 2011 there were at least two people, both aged 70, with some knowledge of Akkala Sámi. Remaining ethnic Akkala Sámi live in the village Yona.\n\nAlthough there exist a description of Akkala Sámi phonology and morphology, a few published texts, and archived audio recordings, the Akkala Sami language remains among the most poorly documented Sami languages. . One of the few items in the language are chapters 23-28 of the Gospel of Matthew published in 1897. It was translated by A. Genetz, and printed at the expense of the British and Foreign Bible Society.\n\nThe Akkala Sámi alphabet consists of these letters: AÂBCČDĐEFGHIJKLMNŊOPQRSŠTUVWXYZŽÄÖ\n\nThe following overview is based on Pekka (Pyotr) M. Zaykov's volume. Zaykov's Uralic phonetic transcription is retained here. The middle dot ˑ denotes palatalization of the preceding consonant, analyzed by Zaykov as semisoft pronunciation.\n\nAkkala Sámi has eight cases, singular and plural: nominative, genitive-accusative, partitive, dative-illative, locative, essive, comitative and abessive. Case and number are expressed by a combination of endings and consonant gradation:\n\nThe table below gives the declension of the personal pronouns \"monn\" ‘I’ and \"mij\" ‘we’. The pronouns \"tonn\" ‘you (sg.)’ and \"sonn\" ‘(s)he’ are declined like \"monn\", the pronouns \"tij\" ‘you (pl.)’ and \"sij\" ‘they’ are declined like \"mij\".\n\nThe interrogative pronouns \"mī\" ‘what?’ and \"tˑī\", \"kī\" ‘who?’ are declined as follows:\n\nThe proximal demonstrative \"tˑa͕t\" ‘this’ and the medial demonstrative \"ti̮t\" ‘that’ are declined as follows:\n\nAkkala Sámi verbs have three persons and two numbers, singular and plural. There are three moods: indicative, imperative and conditional; the potential mood has disappeared. Below, the paradigm of the verbs \"va͕n̄ˑće\" ‘to walk’ and \"korrɛ\" ‘to knit’ is given in the present and imperfect tense:\n\nThe verb \"ĺiije\" ‘to be’ conjugates as follows:\n\nCompound tenses such as perfect and pluperfect are formed with the verb \"ĺii̭je\" in the present or imperfect as auxiliary, and the participle of the main verb. Examples are \"ĺam tĭĕhtmi̮nč\" ‘I have known’ from \"tĭĕhttɛ\" ‘to know’, and \"ĺai tui̭jāma\" ‘(s)he had made’ from \"tui̭je\" ‘to make’.\n\nThe conditional mood has the marker \"-č\", which is added to the weak grade of the stem: \"kuarčim\" ‘I would sew’, \"vizzčik\" ‘you (sg.) would become tired’.\n\nAs in other Sámi languages, Akkala Sámi makes use of a negative verb that conjugates according to person and number, while the main verb remains unchanged. The conjugation of the negative verb is shown here together with the verb \"aĺ̄ḱe\" ‘to begin’:\n\nThe third person singular and plural of the verb \"ĺii̭je\" ‘to be’ have special contracted forms \"ɛĺĺa\" and \"jāĺa\".\n"}

(The larger Uniting Church in Australia incorporated about two thirds of the PCA in 1977.)\n\nWhen captain James Cook landed in Australia in 1776 he was sure to have had some Presbyterians in his crew. John Hunter the captain of HMS \"Sirius\" was a former Church of Scotland minister.\nLater Presbyterian Christianity came to Australia with the arrival of members from a number of Presbyterian denominations in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century.\nThe Presbyterian missionaries played an important role to spread the faith in Australia. Since then Presbyterianism grew to the fourth largest Christian faith in the country.\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia was formed when Presbyterian churches from various Australian states federated in 1901. The churches that formed the Presbyterian Church of Australia were the Presbyterian Churches of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. These state churches were (and still are) incorporated by separate Acts of Parliament (i.e. by the respective State Parliaments) for property holding purposes. (These Acts are known as Property Trust Acts).\n\nIn 1977 two-thirds of the Presbyterian Church of Australia together with nearly all the membership of the Congregational Union of Australia and the Methodist Church of Australasia, joined to form the Uniting Church in Australia. Much of the third who did not join the Uniting Church did not agree with its liberal views, although a number remained because of cultural connections.\n\nBefore the union the Presbyterian Church of Australia was liberal, but the continuing Presbyterian Church became increasingly conservative. A resurgence of traditional Reformed theology took place. In 1982 the denomination withdrew from the largely liberal World Communion of Reformed Churches and later joined the conservative World Reformed Fellowship. In 1987 a new hymnbook was introduced. In 1991 the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Australia repealed the approval of the ordination of women. Women elders continue in some states. The heresy trial of Peter Cameron in 1993 upheld historic Reformed beliefs. The church is active in missions with about 130 missionaries working around the world, including Korea, the Pacific and Myanmar.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia's official website has stated that the church has over 50,000 adults and children within 740 congregations with more than 600 ministers, deaconesses and theological students.\n\nAt the last Commonwealth Census (2016) nearly 540,000 people identified as Presbyterian/Reformed, representing 2.3% of the population. This makes Presbyterianism Australia's fifth largest Christian denomination, although not all Presbyterians are members of the Presbyterian Church of Australia. See also List of Presbyterian Denominations in Australia.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia's missionary organisation is the Australia Presbyterian World Mission. The organisation has more than 170 cross-cultural missionaries.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia has established Arabic, Chinese, Cook Islands, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Samoan and Sudanese congregations, as well as a deaf Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe Presbyterian Inland Mission continues the work of the Australian Inland Mission founded by John Flynn in 1912. Padres patrol outback Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, and hopes to expand into the Northern Territory and Tasmania when resources become available.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia publishes the monthly \"Australian Presbyterian\" magazine and provides social and educational services.\n\nThe following schools have links with or are run by the Presbyterian Church of Australia. The closeness and formality of association varies.\n\n\n\n\"The following schools in Queensland are conducted by the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association.\"\n\n\nThe PCA currently has three colleges, based in Australia's three largest cities. These include: the Queensland Theological College in Brisbane, Christ College in Sydney and the Presbyterian Theological College in Melbourne. Trinity Theological College, Perth, though independent, is also recognised as a theological training institution.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church operates the Reformers Bookshop in Sydney (as a joint venture with Stanmore Baptist Church) and the PTC Media Centre - part of the Presbyterian Theological College in Melbourne.\n\nMinisters and elders of the Presbyterian Church of Australia are required to agree to the Westminster Confession of Faith as their subordinate authority under the Bible.\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia belong to the World Reformed Fellowship, which is a conservative association, where Reformed, Presbyterian, Reformed Baptist and Reformed Episcopal denominations, congregations and individuals can also participate.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Australia is ruled by elders or presbyters. Presbyterian churches recognise two types of elders: teaching elders (ministers) and ruling elders. These elders meet at a local level in the Kirk Session. Only ordained ministers may preside at Communion, or the Lord's Supper, except in the rare circumstance where the presbytery licenses a ruling elder to do so. Likewise, only a minister can administer Baptism. A board or committee of management handles the material concerns of the local congregation. Deacons may also be elected to provide practical care.\n\nThe minister and an elder from each parish have a seat at their regional presbytery and at their state's general assembly. The General Assembly of Australia (GA of A), composed of commissioners from each presbytery and state assembly, meets every three years. Every year each state's general assembly elects a moderator, while the General Assembly of Australia elects a moderator general for a three-year term.\n\nIn 1991, the PCA's General Assembly of Australia determined that only men are \"eligible for admission to the Ministry of Word and Sacraments.\" The rights of women ordained prior to this time were not affected.\nCurrent ministers in the Presbyterian Church of Australia include Allan Harman, David Mitchell, Iain Murray and Bruce W. Winter. Notable former ministers of the PCA include Peter Cameron, who was charged with heresy in 1993 and subsequently excommunicated.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1876945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876945", "title": "Tallensi", "text": "Tallensi\n\nTallensi, also spelled Talensi, are a people of northern Ghana who speak a language of the Gur branch of the Niger-Congo language family. They grow millet and sorghum as staples and raise cattle, sheep, and goats on a small scale. Their normal domestic unit is the polygamous joint family of a man and his sons (and sometimes grandsons) with their wives and unmarried daughters. Married daughters live with their husbands in other communities, commonly nearby.\n\nThe Tallensi are polygamous and follow a patrilineal system of kinship and descent. Great emphasis is placed on inheritance and the tensions surrounding parents' relationships with their children. It is considered essential for a man to have a son if he is to achieve fulfillment and be venerated as an ancestor after his death. However, the birth of a first-born son, and to a lesser extent a first-born daughter, is held to mark the culmination of a man's 'rise' in the world, and the start of his decline. Meanwhile, the son grows to replace and supplant the father. The resulting ambivalence between father and son plays an important role in Tallensi rituals and taboos.\n\nTaboos begin when the first-born son reaches the age of five or six. From this time on the son may not eat from the same dish as his father, wear his father's cap or tunic, carry his father's quiver, use his father's bow, or look into his father's granary. When the son reaches adolescence, he may not meet his father in the entrance to the house compound. Similar taboos exist to regulate the relationship between mother and first-born daughter. The daughter, for example, may not look into her mother's storage pot.\n\nUpon the death of a father, his first-born son and daughter lead the rituals involved in his funeral. The son, at this point, puts on his father's cap and tunic. A tribal elder, carrying the dead man's bow, ritually guides the son to his father's granary and shows him the inside. After his father's death the son is considered a mature man for the purposes of ritual, and it is his responsibility to make sacrifices to the ancestors, chief among them being his own father, who being recently dead is held to act as an intermediary between those still living and the more remote ancestors.\n\nIt is believed that these taboos and rituals serve to channel ambivalence and resentment between generations into culturally defined and culturally acceptable means of expression.\n\nAmong the Tallensi tribe there is a belief in the sacred crocodile. As Meyer Fortes highlighted in his ethnographic work \"The concept of the person\", special crocodiles in special pools are considered persons among the Tallensi. No local man, indeed no Tallensi would dare kill or injure a sacred crocodile. Every Tallensi knows that these crocodiles are the incarnation of important clan ancestors. To kill one of these is like killing a person. It is murder of the most heinous kind and it would bring disaster on the whole clan.\n\nHowever, not all crocodiles are considered persons (\"ni-saal\") for instance, in the rivers that are fished in the dry season - is not a person, not sacred. It can be killed and eaten.\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed and filed for patent in 1986 by Rick E. Hunts, a San Diego, California carpenter. US patent 4679322 was granted in 1987 and the product marketed since 1988. Hunt initially sold the Flowbees out of his garage before finding success with live demonstrations at a county fair. The product was advertised as being capable of performing \"hundreds of precision layered haircuts\" in frequently aired late-night television infomercials. By 2000, two million Flowbees had been sold.\n\nHair cutting devices like the Flowbee have found continued use by astronauts during spaceflight missions, including on the ISS, because of its convenience. Hair particles get collected by the vacuum instead of floating away, and becoming potentially hazardous to sensitive equipment or accumulating inside the spacecraft.\n\nThe Flowbee can also be used to groom dogs with long hair such as Maltese or Bichon Frisé with a special pet grooming attachment which is sold separately. Previously, a special green-colored \"Flowbee Pet Groomer\" variant of the device was available.\n\nOver the years, the Flowbee device saw at least three revisions which can be identified by the shape and labeling of the cutting head (\"Vac-u-cut\", \"Flowbee Int.\", \"Flowbee.com\"). It is still being manufactured and sold via their factory direct website and various outlets across the Internet. The Flowbee factory was located in Flour Bluff, a suburb of Corpus Christi, Texas but was later moved to Kerrville, Texas.\nReference to the Flowbee has been made in numerous films and television shows. It was featured on \"The Fourth Hour\", hosted by Pat Gray and Stu Burguiere on GBTV, during the Infomercial Friday segment which aired on June 22, 2012. The Flowbee was given poor reviews by both hosts after the product was tested despite initial optimism by Burguiere. Gray quipped that \"the problem seems to be that [the Flowbee] doesn't actually cut hair\". It was also spoofed in the film \"Wayne's World\" as a device called the \"Suck Kut\".\n\nReference to the Flowbee was made in the American comedy series \"Glee\".

The denomination was formed in 1967, as a result of growing theological liberalism within the Presbyterian Church of Australia, prior to the formation of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977. \n\nThe PRC met for the first time in Sutherland, Sydney, on Sunday, 8 December 1967. Today it is made up of congregations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Vanuatu and Fiji. During its existence there have also been congregations and/or mission works in the Australian Capital Territory, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Kenya, but these have not continued.\n\nThe Presbyterian Reformed Church formed in 1967 because of the desire of its founders to maintain the gospel witness of the church. \n\nThe move to form a new church was a result of growing liberalism within the Presbyterian Church of Australia. \n\nAs early as 1901, a Declaratory Act was passed, which toned down the distinctive Calvinistic doctrines of the Westminster Confession of Faith and allowed liberty of opinion for ministers on a wide range of doctrines set forth in the Confession. \n\nIn 1936, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, in a private session, shelved charges levied against Dr Samuel Angus who denied the deity of Christ and the inspiration and authority of Scripture as defined in Chapter 1 of the Westminster Confession of Faith.\n\nIn 1967, Professor Lloyd Geering, the Principal of the Presbyterian Theological College in New Zealand was brought up on charges of 'doctrinal error'. During his church trial he claimed that the remains of Jesus lay somewhere in Palestine and rejected the notion that God is a supernatural being who created and continues to look over the world. \n\nDespite these views, Professor Geering was acquitted of the charges by the 1967 General Assembly. This acquittal can rightfully be considered the immediate cause of the formation of the Presbyterian Reformed Church of Australia.\n\nFor the first 6 months of its existence, the Presbyterian Reformed Church consisted of the congregation at Sutherland. During the second half of 1968, congregations were established in Brisbane, Queensland, Ryde, New South Wales and Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. During 1969 a youth group of over 20 people at Cronulla Presbyterian became part of the PRC.\n\nThe PRC has grown to include congregations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and as a result of missionary work have established congregations in Vanuatu and Fiji. Other works have been undertaken in the Australian Capital Territory, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Kenya, but the congregations established in those areas have not continued.\n\nThe Presbyterian Reformed Church receives the Bible (consisting of the sixty six books of the Old and New Testament) as the inspired word of God and the only foundation for how to serve God and live as Christians.\n\nBeing a Reformed Church, it holds to the Calvinistic system of Biblical truth and receives the Westminster Confession of Faith as it Confessional standard, with a few stated amendments. The full text of the Westminster Confession of Faith, with stated amendments, can be found here.\n\nIn summary, the PRC believes:\n\nThe church is governed in the Presbyterian form. Essentially, each local congregation is governed by a group of elected elders, each of equal rank (including the Minister).

{"id": "1876973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876973", "title": "Jauch family", "text": "Jauch family\n\nThe Jauch family of Germany is a Hanseatic family which can be traced back till the Late Middle Ages. At the end of the 17th century the family showed up in the Free Imperial and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. The members of the family acted as long-distance merchants. They became hereditary grand burghers of Hamburg and were Lords of Wellingsbüttel Manor – nowadays a quarter of Hamburg.\n\nThe Jauch have brought forth some notable lineal descendants, both patrilineal and matrilineal. They can trace the nearer cognatic kinship of the issue of the progenitor Johann Christian Jauch the Elder (1638–1718) in the following centuries to a number of renowned contemporaries.\n\nThe Jauch originate from Thuringia where as the first family member the widow Lena Joherrin is chronicled 1495 in today's Bad Sulza.\n\nJohann Christian Jauch the Elder (1638–1718) left Sulza and entered the service of the Güstrow branch of the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg. Two of his sons joined the service of the Electors of Saxony and Kings of Poland. These branches were since the lieutenant colonel of the Franz Georg Jauch (b. 1681) and the major general Joachim Daniel Jauch (1688–1754) mistakenly regarded as members of the aristocracy. They became extinct in the 18th century.\n\nThe members of the family who had served the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg left the Residenz Güstrow in 1696 and turned to Lüneburg, which was equal to a Free Imperial City. In 1701 they gained the citizenship () of Lüneburg. Even though the family there brought forth clerics and jurists thereunder a canon, a secular canon and a dean as well as a senator of Hannover it was not only confined to the urban educated middle class (). Other members of the family acted as merchants – listed 1699 at the „Uraltes löbliches Kramer-Amt“, the Merchants Guild at Hamburg – and subsequently as internationally acting merchants.\n\nThe trading firm was relocated in the middle of the 18th century by Carl Daniel Jauch (1714–1794) from the falling back Lüneburg to Hamburg, the ″Queen of the cities″. Since the 17th century Hamburg played a special role in Germany's economic history because thanks to its it came out of the Thirty Years' War as the wealthiest and most populous of all German cities.\n\nHamburg was a strictly bourgeois mercantile republic in which neither nobility existed, which was exiled since 1276, nor patricians in the strict sense of the formally defined class of governing elites found within the other free imperial cities. In contrast to the mediatised burgesses in the towns located in monarchies which were governed by authoritarianism Hamburg was characterized by its free citizens tied to the culture of England. Although a republic the town was not a democracy moreover an oligarchy because it was governed solely by the Hanseaten. They formed the small in Hamburg and Bremen purely bourgeois upper class of society in the sovereign and republican states Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck.\n\nThese three cities built up between 1630 and 1650 the Hanseatic Community (). It was formed after the Hanseatic League became informally extinct in the beginning of the 17th century. Therefore, it has to be differentiated between the earlier Hanseatic merchants () of the former Hanseatic League and the later Hanseaten as a class of the three cities which built the Hanseatic Community.\n\nSince the end of the 18th century the family belongs to the Hanseaten. (1765–1855) who is the last common ancestor of today's Jauch, gained at the end of the 18th century the citizenship () of the Free Imperial and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and subsequently the hereditary grand burghership (). Rittmeister () (1848–1930) was for almost twenty years till 1915 – when he volunteered regardless of his age for military service in the Landwehr cavalry - one of the last members of the Hamburg Parliament, who were delegated as representatives of the grand burghers () and not contesting an election by the burghers.\n\nIn the German Revolution of 1918–19 the workers' and soldiers' councils put the city administrations under their control ending the reign of the Hanseaten also in Hamburg.\n\nThe family owned on the Elbe next to the old Hamburg timber harbour and situated on the city's dyke the Baroque house \"Stadtdeich\" number 10 and the nearby houses \"Stadtdeich\" 3 and \"Stadtdeich an der Elbseite\" (on the Elbside) 159. \"Stadtdeich\" 10 (sometimes referred to as \"Stadtdeich\" 9) was a which was destroyed in the Operation Gomorrah end of July 1943 – the heaviest assault in the history of aerial warfare and later called the Hiroshima of Germany by British officials.\n\nDestroyed along with this historical building were the family crypt on the former cemetery in Hamm, Hamburg () and the \"Auguste Jauch Woman's Home for Needy Widows\" () located \"Bürgerweide\" 59 there.\n\nAround the Outer Alster Lake the Jauch possessed the houses \"An der Alster\" 24, \"An der Alster\" 28 and \"Schwanenwik\" 18. In addition, they possessed country houses on the Bille in Reinbek and in the then popular garden suburb Hamm.\n\nThe regions surrounding Hamburg belonged to the Duchy of Holstein and were since 1713 territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, later Province of Schleswig-Holstein in the Kingdom of Prussia. Here became the property of the Jauch Wellingsbüttel Manor, and Krummbek Manor and the estates Fernsicht and Marienhof on the Stör at Kellinghusen and Schwonendal in Karby, Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nToday the Jauch own the Von Othegraven Winery. The manor house, its English garden and the vineyard Kanzemer Altenberg constitute a listed cultural heritage site.\n\nThe plantation Armenia Lorena and other coffee plantations of the Jauch nearby San Rafael Pie de la Cuesta in Guatemala were under severe pressure of the US government seized by the Guatemalan government in the Second World War and expropriated without compensation in 1953.\n\nWhile the commoners () in the landlocked Imperial States of the Holy Roman Empire were subjected to bureaucracy and its civil officialdom (), Hamburg was distinguished by its honorary self-government by the most respected of its free citizens, the Hamburg notables ().\n\nThe Jauch served mainly as honorary almoners () for Hamburg's , as provisors of the and as board members of their own and other humanitarian foundations. The Jauch belonged to the founding fathers of the \"Humanitarian Aid for , Hamm and Horn\" (), which took care of those poor who did not receive support from the city.\n\nKeeping with the age-old Hanseatic tradition in setting up humanitarian foundations the Jauch maintained a daily soup kitchen for the poor for free (). They also built and maintained almshouses in Hamburg () and Wellingsbüttel.\n\nJohann Christian Jauch senior (1765–1855) served from 1820 until 1833 as dyke-count and first dyke count () of Hamburg-Hammerbrook. He was in charge as first dyke count when the dam failed during the February flood of 1825, 2.000 feet southeast of the Jauch house Stadtdeich 10 in Hamburg.\n\nIn the Hamburg Citizen Militia the social class and the wealth of the individual predetermind the branch of his service and his military rank – which was the opposite of the Royal Prussian Army where the officer rank made the individual a member of the upper class of society. The most prestigious citizens gladly served as officers in the militia.\n\nThe service in the cavalry was generally a badge of high-ranking social status not least because of the high costs caused by maintaining the cavalry horses and the keeping of a groom which had to be borne by each cavalryman himself. All metal parts of a cavalry officer uniform had to be gilded. For these reasons the Hanseatic cavalry was the stomping ground for the grand burghers.\n\nThe conscripted members of the family performed their service in the militia as first lieutenants in the cavalry under the cavalry commanders Rittmeister () Ernst Merck and later Rittmeister Adolph Godeffroy.\n\nAmong the ancestors of the Hamburg branch of the family are several First Mayors of the city-state of Hamburg, historically equivalent to a sovereign head of state. One of these is (1470–1538) who was the head of the Lutherans in Hamburg, implemented the Protestant Reformation and became the first evangelical mayor of the city.\n\nEleonora Maria Jauch (1732–1797) is the ancestress of the Lübeck Hanseatic to which belong her son the burgomaster (head of state) Christian Adolph Overbeck and her grandson the painter and head of the Nazarene movement Friedrich Overbeck.\n\nOther offspring of the Jauch are the Venerable Servant of God Hanna Chrzanowska, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, the first International German Golf Champion , the Barons Bolton, owners of the extinct duchy Bolton, branches of Magnates of Poland as the Princes Czartoryski and the Counts Potocki, as well as branches of the Princes Podhorski and the .\n\nConstance Jauch (1722–1802) is the ancestress of the Polish noble which was granted the indygenat by the sejm. Her son Karol Mauricy Lelewel, godson of King Augustus III of Poland, belongs to the fathers of the Constitution of May 3, 1791 which is regarded to be the first modern constitution of Europe, grown out of the spirit of Polish Enlightenment. The Polish historian and rebel Joachim Lelewel (1786–1861), grandson of Constance Jauch, was creator of Poland's unofficial motto \"For our freedom and yours\". He was member of Poland's Provisional Government in the November Uprising 1830. Czar Nicholas I was dethroned in 1831 as King of Poland under his leadership as president of the radical . His brother Lieutenant Colonel Jan Pawel Lelewel (1796–1847) participated on 3 April 1833 in the Frankfurter Wachensturm, the attempt to start a revolution in all German states.\n\nColonel (1798–1859), son of Ludovica Jauch (1772–1805), was one of the thirtytwo members of the Emperor Deputation on 3 April 1849 which offered Frederick William IV of Prussia the office of emperor. Lieutenant general of the Waffen-SS Karl Fischer von Treuenfeld, descendant of Eleonora Maria Jauch (1732–1797), was a close friend of Erich Ludendorff and one of the leading figures of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, a failed attempt by Adolf Hitler, to seize power in Germany. Charlotte Jauch's (1811–1872) grandson Otto von Feldmann (1873–1945) was policy officer of Paul von Hindenburg and in charge of the campaign by which Hindenburg became President of Germany in 1925.\n\n1512 Georg, Matthias and Nikolaus Jauch were registered as propertied men () in . Matthias Jauch Jauch there was enfeoffed by the sovereign with the Segelitz estate. Georg Jauch (1606–1675) was burgomaster of Sulza.\n\nIn the 17th century Sulza has been twice devastated, 1613 by the \n\nIn 1688, Crown Prince Carl died without a male heir. Johann Christian Jauch the Elder quit the service and became burgher of the city of Güstrow, dealing at retail and being a court shoemaker, purveyor to the ducal family. His eldest son Johann Christopher Jauch (1669–1725) had been a stipendiary of the duke and carried out since the end of 1694 the function of a court chaplain (). After the death of the last Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, Gustav Adolph, in 1695 the dukedom of Mecklenburg-Güstrow became extinct. Though duchess Magdalena Sibylla maintained a small court until 1718 the residence Güstrow lost its splendour and relevance. Moreover, Ingborg Jauch had already died. Therefore, almost all family members left Güstrow 1696 and turned to Lüneburg.\n\n1701 the Jauchs became burghers of Lüneburg. At Lüneburg Johann Christopher Jauch (1669–1725) was Royal British and Electoral Brunswick-Lüneburg Dean of the Lutheran churches () at St. John's Church, Lüneburg, while Johann Christian Jauch (1702–1778) became canon, 1754 subsenior collegii canonici, 1760 The Very Reverend () and vice-dean () with the function of a provost of the Lutheran cathedral of Bardowick. He married Clara Maria Rhüden (1710–1775), who was a great-great-grandchild of the Lutheran theologian of the Protestant Reformation (1559–1605), thereby ancestor of all later Jauchs, son of deacon Paul Gesner, who was taught by Martin Luther and consecrated by Johannes Bugenhagen. Her great-great-grandfather, the professor of philosophy at Hamburg, Bernhard Werenberg (1577–1643), has been an opponent to the noted scientist Joachim Jungius at the same place. Her uncle was the predecessor of Johann Christopher Jauch and great-grandson of Philipp Melanchthon Heinrich Jonathan Werenberg (1651–1713). Ludolph Friedrich Jauch (1698–1764), son of the dean Johann Christopher Jauch, was Senior Pastor of Lüneburg's St. Michael's Church (), his brother Tobias Christoph Jauch (1703–1776), was a legal practitioner and deputy (), member of the municipal council () of Lüneburg. Carl Jauch (1735–1818) was Royal British and Electoral Brunswick-Lüneburg judge of the castle court of justice () in Horneburg and canon of the Cathedral of Bardowick, Friedrich August Jauch (1741–1796), son of the imperial civil law notary Adolph Jauch (1705–1758), was senator and police governor of the city of Hannover.\n\nCarl Jauch (1680–1755), merchant in Lüneburg, has been a supporter of the theologian, alchemist and physician Johann Conrad Dippel, by some authors debatably claimed to be the model for Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\". After Dippel's expulsion from Denmark 1727 Carl Jauch gave shelter to the refugee who was 1729 expelled from Lüneburg, too. Carl Jauch was married to a grandnice of the Lübeck dean (1640–1698), who strongly influenced the faith and the thinking of Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nEleonora Maria Jauch's (1732–1797) father-in-law was the dean of Bardowick , in whose foster-parental home August Hermann Francke 1687 had been guest when he experienced his so-called \"Lüneburg conversion\" (), making him one of the earliest leaders of Pietism.\n\n1698 Johann Christopher Jauch adjourned his function in Lüneburg and served as court chaplain for Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, queen consort of Poland and grand duchess consort of Lithuania during her cure at Pretzsch, encouraging her to keep at her Lutheran faith after the conversion of her husband to Catholicism. Christiane Eberhardine later was named by her Protestant countrymen \"The Praying Pillar of Saxony\" ()\n\nHis brother Joachim Daniel (1688–1754) served at first in the army of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, before he changed 1705 as lieutenant into the Saxon army. He took part as a captain in the first siege of Stralsund 1711–12 during the Great Northern War. At the end he was contemporaneously royal Polish colonel (since 1736), electoral Saxon major general (since 1746), superintendent of the Saxon building authority in Poland (since 1721), with the title director (since 1736), remunerated for each function separately. His primary obligation was to supervise the baroque development of the city of Warsaw. Vital was his responsibility for the extensive merrymakings of the Saxon court at Warsaw.\n\nWhen 1730 at the end of tremendous fireworks at Zeithain which lasted for five hours, instead of the correct \"VIVAT\" in front of 48 foreign princes and numerous other lords a mistake in writing occurred and a \"FIFAT\" was illuminated, he gained his cognomen \"Fifat\". He erected the Palais Jauch in Warsaw's suburb Solec and was architect for a number of prominent baroque buildings in Poland.\n\nHe married Eva Maria Münnich, said to be the daughter of the later Russian Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph Count von Münnich (1683–1767), his predecessor as superintendent of the Saxon building authority. His son August von Jauch (b. 1731) was godson of King Augustus II the Strong. The elaborate cradle endowed to his parents by the king, later the cradle for Joachim Lelewel, is exhibited in the National Museum, Kraków. Joachim Daniel Jauch is buried in the Capuchins Church in the Miodowa in Warsaw.\n\nSome members of the family followed Major General Joachim Daniel von Jauch (1688–1754) as officers into the Saxon and Polish army, two of them, Franz Georg Jauch (b. 1681) and Heinrich Georg Jauch (b. 1709), serving as lieutenant colonels – colonels in relation to the other regiments () – in the Royal Guard of King Augustus II the Strong and King Augustus III of Poland. Franz Georg Jauch 1724 was participating as a captain in the Blood-Bath of Thorn, commanding a company of the .\n1699 Franz Jürgen Jauch and his brother Christian Jauch the Younger († 1720) served an apprenticeship as merchant in Hamburg. 1752 the merchant Joachim Daniel Jauch (1714–1795) moved his business from Lüneburg to Hamburg. Lt. Johann Georg Jauch (1727–1799) kidnapped 1754 Anna , daughter of the Secretary of State of Hamburg Magnifizenz Johann Baptista Mutzenbecher (1691–1759), member of one of Hamburg's leading families and married her. Under Johann Christian Jauch senior (1765–1855), son of Johann Georg Jauch, the Jauchs became the most important and wealthiest wood traders of Hamburg who reached grand burghership status of the town. Thus, they became members of the ruling class, the Hanseatics (\"Hanseaten\") in one of the wealthiest cities of Germany, with whose financial capacity only Vienna could compete because of the local high nobility concentrating there and its wealth.\n\nChristian Jauch senior's sons were founders of the three still existing branches of the family: Wellingsbüttel, Schönhagen und Fernsicht. His great-grandnephew was (1874–1923), naval archtitect and significant for the upgrowth of submarines in World War I, cousin of first president of the Federal Republic of Germany Theodor Heuss.\n\nHis eldest son Johann Christian Jauch junior (1802–1880) acquired the Manor house Wellingsbüttel, previously domicile of the penultimate Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, Friedrich Karl Ludwig, ancestor of the modern-day British royal family. In addition to his land he leased the for hunting, which is today Hamburg's largest nature reserve. Alongside his home in Hamburg he erected a deer park and a cage for the bears he brought with himself from his voyages to Russia. The poet Hebbel wrote to his long-time compagnion Elise Lensing, who had lived for many years in the house Stadtdeich 43, after she moved out:\n\n1863 he was a patron of the international agricultural exhibition on the Heiligengeistfeld.\n\nHis son Carl Jauch (1828–1888) was Lord of Wellingsbüttel, too. He married Louise von Plessen (1827–1875), daughter of the Grand Ducal Mecklenburg Governor (\"Großherzoglich Mecklenburgischen Oberlanddrost\") Ulrich von Plessen und great-granddaughter of Baron (\"Reichsfreiherr\") Seneca von Gelting (1715–1786), who was married to a nice of Johannes Thedens and had become highly wealthy as chargé d'affaires of the Dutch East India Company in Cirebon. His grandfather Diederich Brodersen (1640–1717), ancestor of today's Jauchs of the Wellingsbüttel branch is also an ancestor to the composer Johannes Brahms. Because of this marriage the earliest notable ancestor is Helmoldus I de Huckelem, documented 1097 and connecting the Wellingsbüttel branch to numerous prominent other descendants of inter alia the von Plessen, von Moltke und von Oertzen families.\n\n\"Auguste Jauch\" (1822–1902) was one of the well known benefactors to the poor of Hamburg. Colonel \"Hans Jauch\" (1883–1965), Commander of the Freikorps \"Jauch\", took part in putting down communist uprisings in 1920 and is founder of the Roman Catholic branch of the family.\n\nLuise Jauch (1885–1933) was head nurse at The Magic Mountain at Davos, the second famous novel of Thomas Mann, when his wife Katia Mann stood there 1912. Luise Jauch's traits have been utilized for the novel's head nurse Adritacia von Mylendonk.\nIn different polls Günther Jauch (b. 1956) was elected as “Most intelligent German” (2002), “Most wanted TV-star to become politician” (2003) and “Most popular German” (2005). He was awarded in 2001 the World Award for entertainment. Since 2008 his sculpture is part of Madame Tussauds wax museum at Berlin.\n\nIn Guatemala the coffee business was from the beginning in the hand of German investors. ″The US government forced the Guatemalan government to confiscate the German coffee holdings and to arrest German citizens. This allowed US companies to take control of the Guatemalan coffee industry.″\n\nHeinrich Jauch (1894–1945) was the Prosecuting Attorney of the Special Tribunal () Hamburg in the criminal trial against the Soviet agent during the interwar period Jan Valtin and 52 other defendants of whom nine were condemned to death. Jauch crushed with this trial the Red Navy () Hamburg. Valtin reports in his biography \"“Out of the Night”\", the US-bestseller of 1941 and the TIME “Book of the Year”, the trial and the executions:\n\nThe trial is regarded to be the model for the Moscow Trials which were a series of three show trials held in the Soviet Union at the instigation of Joseph Stalin between 1936 and 1938. I these trials Stalin got rid of most of the surviving Old Bolsheviks, as well as the former leadership of the Soviet secret police. In addition, it is believed that Heinrich Jauch has won the majority of the death sentences in Hamburg bevor he was called to Berlin.\n\nThe first who were sentenced to death were executed on 19 May 1934. Formerly a guillotine had been used, but it had been discarded as a French method of decapitation. Since then people were put to death with an executioner's ax. \nThe executions under the direction of Heinrich Jauch became, entwined with the events of the Altona Bloody Sunday, the literary model for a novel and two films. The novelist Arnold Zweig red 1938 in a newspaper in Haifa the mistaken information that Dettmer and others had been executed by a master butcher named Fock who after a couple of months had committed suicide. Zweig made literary use of the beheadings and the alleged fate of the headsman and published 1943 the novel (\"The axe of Wandsbek\"). 1951 an East German film script, The Axe of Wandsbek was adapted from the novel followed by the West German film . In memory of Jonny Dettmer a Stolperstein was set into the ground in front of the house where he lived in Hamburg-Eilbek.\n\nIn 1937 Heinrich Jauch brought the charge against Arnold Bernstein a shipowner and pioneer of transatlantic car transport. Bernstein was imprisoned on charges of foreign exchange offenses. At the time of his arrest, he was the owner of one of the largest Jewish businesses in Germany. The company was confiscated without compensation and after an additional payment of $30,000 in U.S. currency, Bernstein was allowed to leave Germany. The show trial is regarded to be the first major Aryanization of Jewish property.\n\nSimilarly, Heinrich Jauch organized that the Nazi state reached control over the trading firm Alfred C. Toepfer Company owned by Alfred Toepfer. He arrested Toepfer on charges of foreign exchange offenses between 1937 and 1938 until Toepfer gave up control over his firm.\n\nMajor General Hans Oster (1887–1945), one of the earliest and most determined opponents of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, moving spirit of German resistance from 1938 to 1943, was a first cousin-in-law of Rittmeister () (1888–1976). Walter Jauch was the founder of Jauch & Hübener, who were at the beginning of the Second World War the largest insurance broker in continental Europe. In the Oster Conspiracy Oster planned already in 1938 to assassinate German dictator Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany. Oster and his opposition group including Hans von Dohnányi were supported by Jauch & Hübener, today's German branch of Aon Corporation. Walter Jauch's co-founder was arrested 1945 in Hamburg and hanged in late April 1945 without trial, a few days before the end of Nazi Germany.\n\nRobert Jauch (1913–2000) fought as an officer, almost as an artillery observer (), ultimately as first lieutenant and officer commanding (OC) of an artillery battery of the Panzer-Artillerieregiment 16, part of the 16. Panzer-Division, in a number of major battles, including the Battle of France, the Battle of Kiev (1941), the First Battle of Kharkov and the Battle of Kalach. In 1942–1943 he took part in the Battle of Stalingrad. Of about 400,000 German casualties during the battle about 150,000 fell in the \"Cauldron\" of Stalingrad itself. The surviving nearly 110,000 Germans of which 2,500 were officers were captured in Stalingrad. Among those was Robert Jauch, who surrendered on his thirtieth birthday, the 2 February 1943. Out of the 110,000 survivors only about 5,000 ever returned from Russia. Robert Jauch became a member of the League of German Officers () (BDO), an anti-Nazi organization. He came back to Germany after seven years as a prisoner of war in Yelabuga, Kuibishev and Simferopol as one of the ″late homecomers″ () in 1950.\n\nEight lineage holders of the Jauch, half of all lineage holders in these generations, died as soldiers on the different European battlefields of the First World War and the Second World War, seven of them killed in action. They all with only one exception had no descendants.\n\nLt. Rudolf Jauch (1891–1915) died 1915 in the sinking of the submarine U-40 by the submarine HMS C24, cooperating with the decoy-ship \"Taranki\". It was the first U-boot trap victory by the British Royal Navy during the First World War. The Distinguished Service Cross which has been awarded for this action to Commander Captain Frederick Henry Taylor is part of the collection of the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. The wreck was discovered a hundred years later approximately off Eyemouth, Berwickshire, Scotland. It is placed as a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. – Since their joint training als officer cadets on Rudolf Jauch was a friend of the later pacifist and anti-war activist Martin Niemöller.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Günther Jauch (1919–1942), aid de camp of the Panzer-Artillerieregiment 227 was killed in action during the Lyuban Offensive Operation, a major Russian attack as part of the Siege of Leningrad which was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and overwhelmingly the most costly in terms of casualties. His final resting place is since 2000 on the German war cemetery Sologubovka.\n\nCatharina Elisabeth Jauch (1671–1736) married the later colonel and architect of King August the Strong, Johann Christoph von Naumann. He was a member of the diplomatic mission of the Holy League in the course of the Treaty of Karlowitz 1699 with the Ottoman Empire, which ended the Great Turkish War.\n\nJuliana Agnesa Jauch (1673–1712) married Baron () Johann Rudolf von Schmiedel, Saxon district governor () and councillor of the board of domains (), their son being Baron Franz Rudolf von Schmiedel, Lord Steward of the Household () of the extravagant Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nJoachim Daniel Jauch's daughter Constance Jauch (1722–1802) married Heinrich Lölhöffel von Löwensprung (1705–1763), privy councillor () and physician to the King Augustus III of Poland. After the death of her father she erected 1755 by Ephraim Schröger the Lelewel Palace – her polonized name – in the Miodowa. Regardless the early death of her husband in 1763 she enabled a splendid career for her children.\n\nHer son Karol Maurycy Lelewel (1750–1830) married a daughter of the starosta of Babice, niece of the archbishop and metropolitan of the archdiocese of Mogilev (1745–1831). Karol Mauricy Lelewel was a Royal Polish captain, reached the indygenat, the naturalisation as a Polish noble, and became a member of the general sejm. 1789 he became appointed as cup-bearer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (), a title possessed prior by Stanisław August Poniatowski before he was elected as the last king and grand duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nKarol Mauricy was from 1778 until 1794 the lawyer and treasurer of the Commission of National Education, which was because of its vast authority and autonomy considered the first Ministry of Education in European history. Lelwel was also centrally linked to another important achievement of the Polish Enlightenment, the Constitution of May 3, 1791.\n\nAfter 1789 during the Sejm Wielki the reformers had to sacrifice many of their privileges in order to gain support for the Constitution of May the 3rd. Nevertheless, it is often argued, with quite some force, that because of the efforts of the Commission of National Education, the Polish language and culture did not disappear into oblivion, during the Partitions of Poland - heavy Russification and Germanisation notwithstanding.\n\nConstance Jauch's grandsons were Joachim, Prot und Jan Pawel Lelewel.\n\nJoachim Lelewel (1786–1861) became Poland's most famous historian. He was a rebel, creator of Poland's unofficial motto \"For our freedom and yours\", member of Poland's Provisional Government 1830, was jointly with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels founder and vice-president of the Democratic Society for the Unification and Brotherhood of all People in Brussels (\"Demokratische Gesellschaft zur Einigung und Verbrüderung aller Völker (Brüssel)\"). The anarchist Michail Bakunin was strongly influenced by him. He was a friend of Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, who had given shelter to him in his manor Lagrange, where he was later arrested and then expelled from France. The 29 May is Lelewel's memorial day in the Jewish almanc for his commitment for the Jewish emancipation.\n\nProt Lelewel (1790–1884) served as a captain during the French invasion of Russia, participated 1812 in the Battle of Berezina and 1813 in the Battle of Leipzig and was decorated as a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur and with the silver medal of the Virtuti Militari. Lieutenant Colonel Jan Pawel Lelewel (1796–1847), was a Polish freedom fighter who unsuccessfully defended 1831 Praga against the Russian invasion and participated on 3 April 1833 in the Frankfurter Wachensturm, the attempt to start a revolution in all German states. 1816–1826 he modernized Zamość Fortress, after his escape from Poland and Germany he became 1837–1947 head engineer of the Canton of Bern.\n\nConstance Jauch's daughter Teresa Lelewelowna (1752–1814) married Adam Józef Cieciszowski (1743–1783), brother of the archbishop and metropolitan . He was Great Scribe of Lithuania () and knight of the Order of Saint Stanislaus. Her granddaughter Aleksandra Franciszka Cieciszowska was married to the Polish minister Jan Paweł Łuszczewski 1784–1795 private secretary of the last King and Grand Duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Stanisław August Poniatowski. He was nominated as count by the King Augustus III of Poland. Their granddaughter Jadwiga Łuszczewska (1834–1908), daughter of the economist Wacław Józef Łuszczewski and the writer Magdalena Łuszczewska, was a Polish poet and novelist.\n\nGreat-grandson of Constance Jauch was the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, author of \"Quo vadis\", Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846–1916). His daughter was the painter Jadwiga Sienkiewicz-Korniłowiczowa.\n\nAnother great-grandson was the founder of the Polish historical study of literature Ignacy Chrzanowski (1866–1940), who died during the Sonderaktion Krakau at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His son Lieutenant Bogdan Chrzanowski was murdered by Soviet soldiers, on the expressed orders of Joseph Stalin, in the Katyn massacre. His daughter Hanna Chrzanowska is being investigated by the Catholic Church for possible sainthood. The council of cardinals in Rome has decreed that she has practised the cardinal virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity to a heroic degree and, therefore, may be referred to as Venerable Servant of God.\n\nConstance Jauch's granddaughter Anna Cieciszowska was sister-in-law of Magdalena Agnieszka Sapieżyna (1739–1780), daughter of Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski and informal consort of King Stanisław August Poniatowski. Great-aunt of Constance's progeny Lelewel was Jadwiga Walewska (b. 1740), sister-in-law of Countess Maria Walewska (1786–1817), mistress of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nEleonora Maria Jauch (1732–1797), daughter of The Very Reverend and vice-dean of the cathedral of Bardowick Johann Christian Jauch (1702–1788), married Georg Christian Overbeck (1713–1786), lawyer at Lübeck and son of the dean Caspar Nicolaus Overbeck. Her son was the mayor of Lübeck Christian Adolph Overbeck (1755–1821). Before he was a senator of Lübeck and sent three times as ambassador Lübeck's to Paris, where he attended on 1 April 1810 the marriage of Napoleon I and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma in the Louvre and later the \"banquet imperial\" there, distorting in his ironical, Jonathan Swift citing comment a line of Virgil's Aeneid: \"quaeque et pulcerrima vidi, et quorum pars parva fui.\".\n\nHer grandson was the painter and head of the Nazarene movement Johann Friedrich Overbeck (1789–1869), decorated with the Prussian Order Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts. On 7 February 1857 Pope Pius IX came for a personal visit in his home, the Villa Cancellotti next to the Via Merulana in Rome. At that time he was painting the large-sized \"Christ absconding from the Jews\" (1858), a commission from Pius IX, and an allegory on the pope's escape 1848 from Rome in disguise as a regular priest, originally on a ceiling in the Quirinal Palace, later covered by the king, and now hanging in front of the Aula delle Benedizione in the Vatican. The Pope encouraged him:\n\nThe archaeologist Johannes Adolph Overbeck (1826–1895) was Constance Jauch's grand-grandson. Her great-granddaughter Cäcilie Lotte Eleonore Overbeck (1856-post 1920), married the anthropologist and ethnologist Emil Ludwig Schmidt (1837–1906), who was personal physician of the hypochondriac \"Cannon King\" Alfred Krupp. The great-granddaughter Wilhelmine Friederike Charlotte Overbeck (1829–1908) was wedded to the well known mechanical engineer Franz Reuleaux (1829–1905), chairman of the German panel of judges for the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia 1876. Great-great-granddaughter Agnes Elisabeth Overbeck (1870–1919), a pianist, was married under the pseudonym \"Baron Eugen Borisowitsch Onégin\" to the operatic contralto Sigrid Onégin, who sang inter alia at Metropolitan Opera and Covent Garden.\nThe denotation ″Buddenbrook-Nobility″ traces back to Thomas Mann's novel Buddenbrooks which won Mann the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. Mann portrayed the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatics in the 19th century. The city where the Buddenbrook family lives shares so many of its street names and other details with Mann's hometown of Lübeck that the identification is perfect, although Mann carefully avoids explicit pronunciation of the name throughout the novel. In spite of this fact, many German readers, in particular such from Lübeck, and critics attacked Mann for writing about the \"dirty laundry\" of his hometown and his own family. However, for a long time that what had been attacked in the past was later regarded being an ennoblement. Those who have a close or distant relative, who has been portrayed in the Buddenbrooks, are half-ironically but at the same time respectfully counted among the \"Buddenbrook-nobility\".\n\nDescendant Charlotte Leithoff (1819–1903) married consul Johann Heinrich Harms (1810–1893) (in the novel: \"August Möllendorpf\"), brother of the senator Georg Friedrich Harms (1811–1892) (in the novel: \"Senator Möllendorpf\"), who was married to the descendant Emma Wilhelmine Buck (1832–1896) (in the novel: \"Frau Möllendorpf geb. Langhals\") and father of Lorenz Harms (1840–1915) (in the novel: \"Konsul Kistenmaker\"). Eleonora Maria Jauch's great-granddaughter Henriette Charlotte Harms (1842–1928) married the senator of Lübeck Johann Fehling (1835–1893), brother of the mayor of Lübeck (in the novel: \"Dr. Moritz Hagenström\") und brother-in-law of the mayor of Lübeck (in the novel: \"Bürgermeister Kaspar Oeverdieck\"). He was a grandson of the poet Emanuel Geibel (in the novel: \"Jean Jacques Hoffstede\"). Their daughter Emilie Charlotte Adele Fehling (1865–1890) married the novelist Lieutenant , brother of the Field Marshal und President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nThe granddaughter of The Very Reverend and vice-dean of the cathedral of Bardowick Johann Christian Jauch (1702–1788), Margaretha Eleonora Ludovica Jauch (1772–1805) was married twice. Son from her first marriage with the merchant Johann Carl Deetz was Colonel (1772–1852) who became in 1847 town major of Wittenberg. Later he became head of the central office of the Prussian Minister of War. 1848–1854 he was town major of Frankfurt, member of the Frankfurt Parliament and one of the thirtytwo members of the Emperor Deputation, chosen by the National Assembly, which offered on 3 April 1849 the Imperial Crown of Germany to Frederick William IV of Prussia.\n\nOtto von Bismarck was at that time Prussian envoj to the Federal Convention in Frankfurt. His relationship to Albert Deetz as town commandant of Frankfurt and member of the Convention was distressed, because Deetz strictly refused to cooperate with him. Bismarck reported to Berlin:\n\nLudovica Jauch's great-great-grandson was Lieutenant Commander () Friedrich Deetz, commander of the German submarine U-757, which was sunk 1944 in the North Atlantic, south-west of Iceland, by depth charges from the British frigate and the Canadian corvette . Another great-great-grandson, Colonel Günther Nentwig (1899–1943), bearer of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, was killed in action as commander of the 295. Infanterie-Division in the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nAfter the death of her first husband Ludovica Jauch married the bassoonist of the Royal Prussian Court Orchestra Johann Heinrich Griebel (1772–1852), stemming from a musical family whose members belonged to the royal orchestra of King Frederick II of Prussia. He was the first teacher of the composer Albert Lortzing, the main representative of the German Spieloper.\n\nHer Stepchild Frederick Griebel (1819–1859), who lived in Toronto, was the first professional violinist in Canada. Even 20 years after his death his reputation survived as that of “the greatest violinist ever resident in this city.″\n\nHer stepgrandchild was the New York City architect George Henry Griebel (1846–1933), who built 1871 in San Antonio, Texas the quadrangle at Fort Sam Houston, later the Dakota Building in New York and the grand staircase in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress.\n\nWilhelmine Jauch (1809–1893) married Theodor Avé-Lallemant, from his maternal side a descendant of the Huguenot leader in the French Wars of Religion Gaspard II de Coligny (1519–1572). Avé-Lallemant was a musician, music-teacher and music-critic. His wife's wealth enabled him, to become after getting married an important promoter of the music and to play for almost half a century a leading role in Hamburg's music life. He was until his death the chief director of the Hamburg Philharmonic Society (). In 1841 he organized and directed the \"3rd North German Music Festival\" in 1841 in Hamburg, which was the biggest festival of its time.\n\nHans von Bülow dedicated to Avé-Lallemant his \"Chant polonais Opus 12\". Klaus Mann describes in his novel \"Pathetic Symphony\" () about the life of Peter Tchaikovsky a meeting between Tchaikovsky and Avé-Lallemant. Tchaikovsky dedicated to his admirer Avé-Lallemant, for whom he had a lot of sympathy, his 5th Symphony.\n\nJohannes Brahms, who was a fourth cousin twice removed of Robert Jauch (1856–1909) and Bertha Jauch (1860–1935), and Robert Schumann became godfathers of two of Theodor Avé-Lallemant's and Wilhelmine Jauch's sons.\n\nThe collection of letters from a number of composers and scores by Brahms is since 2000 part of the collection of the Brahms-Institut. Avé-Lallemant, who played the violin himself, possessed the Cremonese violin of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1772–1806). Apart from being a soldier in the Napoleonic wars, Louis Ferdinand was also a gifted musician and composer. The prince brought his violin also to military campaigns. He bequeathed it to his friend, Avé-Lallemant's father, the evening before his death in the Battle of Saalfeld with the words: ″In case that I will not return from the battle.″ \n\nThe from the Canton of Uri in the Old Swiss Confederacy, are chronicled since 1368. They stepped up significantly for the first time with Hans Jauch (1500–1568), who won 1531 during the Reformation in Switzerland for the Roman Catholic cantons the Second War of Kappel.\n\nNeither are related to the Hanseatic Jauch the Jauch of Villingen-Schwenningen and the surrounding municipalities in today's Schwarzwald-Baar district, who were commoners of the Grand Duchy of Baden.\n\nMost Jauch spread over the world in present-day time descend from these Jauch, of whom a number due to poverty and famine emigrated with hundreds of other inhabitants in several waves from 1747–1754, 1801, 1817, 1847 and in the period thereafter until about 1890 to Prussia, Bessarabia, the United States and Canada.\n\nTo the Jauch of Schwennigen belongs – though stationed in Hamburg – the SS Oberscharführer , who was convicted and given the death sentence in 1946 because of his involvement in the killings in the subcamp Bullenhuser Damm of the Neuengamme concentration camp.\n\nAnother Jauch family considered in the literature originates from Pegau and spread to Meißen in the Electorate of Saxony. Their ancestor was the butcher Andreas Jauch (b. 1523) and their best known member was the jurist and controlling clerk of the 17th century Haubold Gottfried Jauch. There is no relationship to the Hanseatic Jauch family, too.\n\n"}

{"id": "1876984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876984", "title": "Evangelical Presbyterian Church (Australia)", "text": "Evangelical Presbyterian Church (Australia)\n\nThe Evangelical Presbyterian Church is a small Reformed Christian denomination. In September 2010 it had five centres: Brisbane; Londonderry (Sydney); Cohuna, Victoria (preaching station); Launceston and Winnaleah (Tasmania) with until 2014 a small school at Herrick near Winnaleah.\nThe EPC was constituted in Launceston, Tasmania, on 29 September 1961 with a doctrinal basis identical to the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, three of whose ministers formed a special presbytery for the purpose of ordaining the first three ministers. Its first ministers were the Reverend Charles Rodman, Eric Turnbull and Hugh McNeilly.\n\nThe denomination was originally called the Reformed Evangelical Church but in 1966 changed its name because according to the church's official history \"it was found that Australian society was not familiar with the term 'reformed' in its historical and church connection. Many associated the word with reform or correctional schools for example.\"\n\nThe creation of the EPC was part of a revival in Reformed and Calvinist theology among Australian evangelical Christians from the 1950s.\n\nThe EPC professes adherence to the Westminster Standards, but rejects common grace and the concept of God having unfulfilled desires for the salvation of the reprobate. That is, the EPC denies that God has any attitude of love or favour to the non-elect in the free offer of the gospel.\n\nThe EPC is also committed to the biblically regulated worship set forth in Westminster Confession of Faith and exemplified in the Directory of Public Worship. This is interpreted to maintain exclusive psalmody and exclude musical instruments in worship.\n\nThe EPC's witness has included political action on moral issues such as making submissions to government on observing the Christian Sabbath and gambling and protesting against what it sees as anti-Christian activities, such as the rock opera, Jesus Christ, Superstar. It supports Bible translation through the Chinese Translation Society (formerly the Reformation Translation Fellowship), and Christian missions in places such as Uganda and the Middle East. Family and young people's camps and studies have been regularly held in Australia.\n\nThe EPC was formed because its members believed the large mainstream denominations from which they had come, including the Baptist, Presbyterian and Methodist churches in Australia, had departed from fundamental Christian truths and contained too much spiritual compromise. Instead they embraced the Reformed faith although its inclusion of infant baptism was problematic for some and at Easter 1961 the Reverend J L Lincolne, former principal of the WEC International College in Launceston left the fellowship and established a new college and congregation based on the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith.\n\nEarly encouragement from the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia (popularly known as \"the Free Church\") was significant in shaping the emerging EPC community. After contemplating joining, the leaders did not proceed with an actual union but there was a desire to continue a fruitful ecumenical relationship with it and other reformed churches. However the largely Anglo EPC saw too many doctrinal, worship style, lifestyle and cultural differences to work closely with the Reformed Church of Australia populated as it was largely by Post-war migrants from the Netherlands.\n\nThe PCEA contributed to the training of EPC ministers through the John Knox Theological College operated 1963–65 out of the East St Kilda PCEA, but by 1964 the EPC was in significant conflict with the PCEA over the free offer of the gospel, as presented by Professor John Murray and Ned Stonehouse in their booklet on the subject. Some of the EPC congregations split with some members from Penguin joining the PCEA in 1965 with their minister Eric Turnbull. (Turnbull was removed from the PCEA ministry in 1979 because of his teaching that the King James Bible was the pure word of God over against other translations, and subsequently formed the Australian Free Church.) Some from Winnaleah joined the PCEA in 1971 after some years independent but returned in 1979. Controversy win the EPC was evident for a number of years. Some considered that the EPC were reacting in a rationalistic way from their previous free will (Arminian) theology, and that they preached the Bible according to the doctrine rather than the doctrine to the Bible. Two ministers withdrew to form the Southern Presbyterian Church in 1986. In 1991 the Covenant Presbyterian Church in Sydney, which had resulted from a schism from the PCEA Western Sydney in 1981, was received into the EPC. In September 2002 the Rockhampton congregation and its minister withdrew to become Grace Presbyterian Church which united in 2009 with the Australian Free Church.\n\nIn 2008 the EPC apologised to the PCEA Synod for the hurt caused by accusation of schismatic conduct by the PCEA in 1965 concerning the reception of the Penguin (now Ulverstone) congregation. Relationships in Tasmania have significantly improved.\n\nEPC ministers train at the Seminary of the Protestant Reformed Churches in Michigan USA. While there are differences on some matters with the Protestant Reformed Churches the two denominations agree on the rejection of common grace.\n\n\n"}

The earliest Turbotrain entered service in 1967, for use on France's SNCF intercity lines. There were four versions in total, with the last exiting service in 2005, and it is the Turbotrain that made advances possible for the TGV.\n\nIn 1967, the SNCF converted a 2-car X 4300 Class diesel multiple unit train originally built by ANF Industrie (Ateliers Construction du Nord de la France) starting in 1963 (either train number X4375 or X4365), into the prototype experimental Turbotrain TGS (\"Turbine à gaz spéciale\"). The new gas-turbine engine was installed into the trailer car of this 2-car set; the original diesel power-car was fitted with a new cab but retained its original diesel motor and transmission.\n\nTrials started on 25 April 1967. The TGS reached on 15 October 1971.\n\nThis is the first-generation of production Turbotrains. These ETG (Elément à Turbine à Gaz) trains were four carriage trainsets which offered 188 seats and possessed one diesel engine and one gas turbine engine. The gas-turbine engine was an 820 kW Turbomeca Turmo IIIF3 gas-turbine Voith hydraulic (derived from a helicopter turbine) and the diesel was a 320 kW Saurer SDHR diesel-mechanical. These trains reached . The ETGs entered service in 1971 on the Paris-Caen-Cherbourg. A total of 14 of these four-car trainsets were manufactured from 1969–1972 by ANF. These trains were maintained at the Venissieux trainshed in Lyon for \"many years\", but were moved to the Lyon Vaise depot in the 1980s. Electrification of the Grenoble line caused some trainsets to be shifted to work in Clermont Ferrand and Metz.\n\nThese trains had five carriages with 280 seats and were built between 1972 and 1976 by ANF and MTE (Societe de Materiel de Traction Electrique). Forty-one RTG trainsets were manufactured for SNCF service. These trains were equipped with one Turmo IIIF1 gas turbine in the even-numbered cabs and one Turmo XII gas turbine in the odd-numbered cabs, reaching . Normally, the even-numbered engine was shut down once the train reached cruising speeds. The RTG entered service in 1973 on the Strasbourg-Lyon and Lyon-Nantes lines, it subsequently entered service on the Paris-Caen-Cherbourg and Paris-Deauville-Dives-Cabourg lines in 1975. The electrification of the Paris-Caen-Cherbourg line in 1996 moved the RTGs onto the Lyon-Bordeaux line until 2005.\n\nIn later years, the SNCF RTG trainsets were modified to allow two RTG trains to be operated together by one driver as a multiple-unit train.\n\nSix examples of the RTG were built by ANF for Amtrak and were dubbed Turboliners in the United States. These RTG Turboliners were first imported into the United States in 1973 and \"impressed with their reliability\" and proliferated with further orders from France and license-production in the United States by Rohr.\n\nThe Egyptian National Railways purchased three enlarged 10-car turbotrains manufactured by ANF for a planned service on the 208 km route between Cairo and Alexandria. However, the trackage is not suitable for such speeds, and the trains have been restricted to maximum and in the vicinity of Cairo.\n\nFour units of Turbotrains were introduced in Iran in 1974 with max speed of between Tehran-Mashhad that later in 2008 were converted to DMUs by substitution of diesel engines instead of turbines.\n\nThis experimental Turbotrain TGV 001 set the world speed record for gas turbine-powered rail vehicles with on 8 December 1972.\n\nThis TGV 001 was a five-car trainset which possessed four gas-turbine engines with a total output of and all axles motored. This train was extensively tested over more than running at over , of which almost half were covered at more than and a peak of . The research program from this prototype, and from the Z7001 Zebulon electric test train, provided data used for the design of the later electric TGV trains.\n\nThe TGV 001 prototype was retired in January 1978; one power-car (TDu 001) from this trainset is preserved and is located on the A4 highway exit number 50 Bischheim near Strasbourg in Alsace, France. The other power-car (TDu 002) is preserved and located ont the A36 highway exit number 13 (Belfort-Glacis du Château) near Belfort in the Territoire de Belfort, France.\n\nThe RTGs were well loved by the public and it is with regret and nostalgia that the Turbotrain was replaced by Corail trains.\n\nOne RTG is kept in running condition at the French National Railway Museum in Mulhouse.\n\n"}

It is a small Presbyterian church numbering slightly over 200 persons with its largest congregation in the area of Geelong, Victoria. The first church, in Geelong, was started in 1858. It links itself historically with those in the Covenanter movement in Scotland who did not accept the settlement of Presbyterianism in that country in 1690, and has sister denominational relations with the Reformed Presbyterian churches of North America, Ireland, and Scotland. Fraternal relations exist with the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia.\n\nA number of Reformed Presbyterians had migrated from Scotland or Ireland to Australia. A number who did not join other branches of Presbyterianism were against occasional hearing, and they wanted a minister of their own. They wrote to the parent church requesting this. Rev. A. M. Moore eventually answered. He was ordained in Belfast 18 August 1857, and arrived in Melbourne in late December 1857, to commence the work in Geelong which he served until his death in 1897. Geelong was the only congregation for many years, the most notable minister after Moore being H.K. Mack who served 1909-46. Congregations were begun in McKinnon, Victoria (1933 begun/1946 organised under Rev. W. R. McEwen), Frankston, Victoria (1971/1977), and Sunbury, Victoria (1979/1981, closed 2006).\n\nIn 1959, Rev. A. Barkley, RP minister in Geelong, became the founding principal of the Reformed Theological College.\n\nIn 1974, the Australian Presbytery petitioned the parent body, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland, and was made a separate denomination (or church) on 12 June. In former times, church law required members to believe that the Solemn League and Covenant were still binding and forbade them from participating in government because the Constitution does not explicitly make the Australia an officially Christian country; these provisions have been repealed.\n\nThe Frankston congregation, after closing in 1989, was revived around 2004 as a preaching station of the McKinnon congregation. The organising pastor from February 2006 was Rev. Ed Blackwood from the United States. In 2008 it became a separate congregation meeting in a hall in Frankston South. The pastor resigned in August 2015 and returned to the U.S.\n\n\n\n"}

Together, as Westside Connection, they produced several songs released on film soundtracks and compilations including \"Bangin'\" (from \"West Coast Bad Boyz II\"), \"Let It Reign\" (from \"Thicker than Water\") and \"It's the Holidaze\" (from \"Friday After Next\").\n\nOn December 9, 2003 the group released their second album \"Terrorist Threats\", hallmarked by the lead single \"Gangsta Nation\" produced by Fredwreck and featuring Nate Dogg.\n\nMack 10 quit the group in 2005 due to a conflict with Ice Cube, and Westside Connection subsequently disbanded. However, Ice Cube and WC continued to collaborate, having since appeared on each other's respective albums. \n"}

It was published in 1955. It was written for and first performed by Fred Astaire in the 1955 musical film \"Daddy Long Legs\", and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1955 as Best Original Song, losing to \"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\".\n\nThe song playfully uses the irresistible force paradox – which asks what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object – as a metaphor for a relationship between a vivacious woman and an older, world-weary man. The man, it is implied, will give in to temptation and kiss the woman. The song's lyrics echo the plot of \"Daddy Long Legs\", in which a reserved man in his 50s (Astaire) falls in love with a woman in her early 20s (Leslie Caron).\n\nThe biggest-selling version was recorded by The McGuire Sisters, reaching #5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in 1955 (see 1955 in music). Sammy Davis Jr. had a popular competing version out the same year which also made the Top 10 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart, peaking at #9. The following year Mel Tormé released a version on his \"Sings Fred Astaire\" album.\n\nBing Crosby recorded the song in 1955 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set \"The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56)\" issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009. \n\nFrank Sinatra recorded the song in 1959 on his album \"Come Dance with Me!\" and it was featured in the incomplete 37-minute 1962 film \"Something's Got to Give\", which was Marilyn Monroe's last work, the film being abandoned after her death. \n\nIn 1964, Ella Fitzgerald included this song on her Verve album \"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Songbook\", with arrangements by Nelson Riddle.\n\nIn the game \"Fallout: New Vegas\", Dean Domino from the add-on sings this song, although it is a reused version of Bing Crosby's cover which can be heard in Radio New Vegas.\n\nJoanne Woodward sings \"Something's Gotta Give\" during a balloon striptease in the film, The Stripper (film) (minute 1:22:20).\n"}

An evergreen perennial, it is widely cultivated for its dramatic flowers. In temperate areas it is a popular houseplant.\n\nSir Joseph Banks described the species in 1788. The specific epithet \"reginae\" means “of the queen”, and commemorates the British queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III. Common names such as “crane flower” and “bird of paradise” reference the open flower’s resemblance to the head and beak of a colourful exotic bird.\n\nGenetic analysis reveals \"Strelitzia juncea\" has been shown to be genetically nested within \"S. reginae\". It is possibly a mutation that is in the process of speciating.\n\nThe plant grows to tall, with large, strong leaves long and broad, produced on petioles up to long. The leaves are evergreen and arranged in two ranks, making a fan-shaped crown. The flowers stand above the foliage at the tips of long stalks. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges is termed the \"spathe\". This is placed perpendicular to the stem, which gives it the appearance of a bird's head and beak; it makes a durable perch for holding the sunbirds which pollinate the flowers. The flowers, which emerge one at a time from the spathe, consist of three brilliant orange sepals and three purplish-blue or white petals. Two of the blue or white petals are joined together to form an arrow-like nectary. When the sunbirds sit to drink the nectar, the petals open to cover their feet in pollen.\n\n\"Strelitzia reginae\" is very popular as an ornamental plant. It was first introduced to Britain in 1773, when it was grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Since then, it has been widely introduced around the world, including the Americas and Australia, growing well in any area that is sunny and warm. In the United States, Florida and California are the main areas of cultivation, due to their warm climate. It is a common ornamental plant in Southern California, and has been chosen as the Official Flower of the City of Los Angeles. \n\nIn the UK it is normally grown under glass, in a cool sunny position such as a greenhouse or conservatory, as it does not tolerate temperatures below . However it may be placed outside during the summer months. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nIt is a low-maintenance plant that is easy to grow in the garden; it is fairly tolerant of soil conditions and needs little water once established. If cared for well, they will flower several times in a year. They will thrive in rich loamy soil, especially when they get plenty of water throughout the year. They do well in full sun to semi-shade and respond well to regular feeding with a controlled release fertiliser and compost. They are sensitive to cold and need to be sheltered from frost, as it can damage the flowers and leaves.\n\n\"Strelitzia reginae\" is slow-growing and will not bloom until three to five years have passed since germination (though it can exceptionally flower at two years). It flowers only when properly established and division of the plant may affect flowering patterns. The flowers are, however, quite long-lasting once they appear. Peak flowering is in the winter and early spring. There is a yellow-flowered cultivar of this plant known as ‘Mandela's Gold’.\n\nIt is propagated by seed or division.\n\nBird-of-paradise plants have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 1, and are considered \"allergy-fighting\"; they produce no airborne pollen.\n\n"}

Searching is free and delivers metadata records as well as digital objects, mostly free of charge. The objects come from institutions located in countries which are members of the Council of Europe and range from catalogue records to full-text books, magazines, journals and audio recordings. Over 200 million records are searchable, including 24 million pages of full-text content and more than 7 million digital objects. Thirty five different languages are represented among the searchable objects.\n\nThe content of the European Library was frozen on 31 December 2016, with no new updates after that date.\n\nThe European Library of today has evolved from a number of earlier projects.\n\nIts starting point was in 1997 when the GABRIEL (Gateway and Bridge to Europe's National Libraries) project set out to establish a joint web portal of European national libraries. At a basic level, the portal provided information about each library's collections and access to their online public access catalogues (OPACs).\n\nGABRIEL was followed by the TEL (The European Library) project, which ran from 2001–2004 and created a framework for access to key national and deposit collections within Europe. The project was part-funded under the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Commission. The national libraries involved in the TEL project were those of Finland, Germany, Italy (Florence), Italy (Rome), Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Switzerland and United Kingdom.\n\nThis led to the launch of TheEuropeanLibrary.org portal on 17 March 2005.\n\nBetween 2005–2007, the TEL-ME-MOR project helped to incorporate 10 more national libraries from new European Union member states as full partners of The European Library. By the beginning of 2008, a further nine national libraries within the European Union and the European Free Trade Association had joined the service.\n\nThe European Library took a further step towards its enlargement with the EDLproject, during which national libraries continued to join The European Library. The project also focused on multilingualism, undertook the first steps towards a European Metadata Registry and created a roadmap for potential digitization efforts in the national libraries.\n\nThe European Library provided much of the organization and support required to launch Europeana – a European Commission initiative that makes millions of digital objects from libraries, museums and archives accessible to the public via the Europeana website.\n\nWhen the European Parliament called for Europeana to be established, the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL), under the auspices of the National Library of the Netherlands and CENL's service The European Library, were asked to submit for a project under the eContentplus programme. Work began on a prototype in 2007 and Europeana was launched in November 2008.\n\nEuropeana now operates independently but The European Library continues to work closely with Europeana. The European Library is the aggregator of digital content from national libraries for Europeana and delivers digital content from national libraries on a monthly basis to Europeana.\n\nAs of July 2012, The European Library was the second biggest content provider to Europeana, with 3.45 million items added to the Europeana database.\n\nSome human and technical resources are also shared between Europeana and The European Library.\n\nIn addition to its search engine, The European Library pulls together themes from the collections of Europe's national libraries and displays them in virtual exhibitions. These exhibitions unite geographically disparate objects in a single online space, offering Pan-European sources on the topic.\n\n\nThe European Library is financed by its owners, the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL). The portal is maintained by The European Library Office located in the premises of the Dutch Royal Library in The Hague. Its programme director is Jill Cousins.\n\nThe 48 National Libraries who participate in The European Library project are:\n\n\nResearch Libraries who have also contributed content to The European Library as a result of the Europeana Libraries project include:\n\n\n\n"}

The story concerned a soap opera writer who adopted two children, a fictionalized version of Irna Phillips' life.\n\nSoap opera writer Betty Kahlman (Elizabeth Lawrence, Augusta Dabney) raised her adopted children without a husband. Her sounding board and friend was fellow soap opera writer Meg Johns, played by actress Anna Minot. Betty married Russell Barry (William Prince) and the early focus was on generational conflicts between a newly married middle-aged couple and their confused children. People tried to understand each other, but were ultimately \"a world apart\", echoing the title. Eventually, the show-within-a-show element was scaled back, and writer Katherine Phillips was replaced by Richard Holland and Suzanne Holland. At that point, Betty and Russell settled into a tranquil marriage.\n\nOther storylines centered on the Sims family, who were mired in less turmoil than the Kahlmans, but still had their problems, as Dr. Ed Sims (James Noble) and his extremely conservative wife Adrian (Kathleen Maguire) struggled with their rebellious daughter Becky (Erin Connor).\n\nMany of the show's performers went on to later notability as actors, including Susan Sarandon (Patrice Kahlman), Nicolas Surovy (Fred Turner), Susan Sullivan (Nancy Condon), Dorothy Lyman (Julie Stark), and David Birney (Oliver Harrell). James Noble (Dr. Ed Sims) would eventually play Governor Eugene Gatling on the television comedy \"Benson\" alongside Robert Guillaume. Clifton Davis, who played Matt Hampton, would later appear in both \"That's My Mama\" and \"Amen\", where he played Reverend Reuben Gregory. Jane White and Davis played mother and son on both \"A World Apart\" and \"Amen\".\n\nThe series ran Monday through Friday at 12:30 pm EST, opposite CBS' then-popular \"Search for Tomorrow\" and NBC's \"The Who, What, or Where Game.\" ABC canceled the show after a little over a year, wrapping up with a moving episode where Patrice Kahlman finally made peace with giving her newborn son up for adoption (among the few, if not only, episodes of this show known to survive).\n"}

Firn eventually becomes glacial ice – the long-lived, compacted ice that glaciers are composed of. Glacier formation can take days to years depending on freeze-thaw factors. Névé is annually observed in skiing slopes, and is generally disliked as an icy falling zone.\n\nNévé has a minimum density of 500 kg/m³, which is roughly half of the density of liquid water at 1 atm.\n\nNévé can also refer to the alpine region in which snowfall accumulates, becomes névé, and feeds a glacier.\n\n"}

Today, she is chiefly remembered for her films choreographed by her then-husband George Balanchine. They include the \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\" sequence from \"On Your Toes\", \"The Goldwyn Follies\", \"I Was an Adventuress\" with Erich Von Stroheim and Peter Lorre, \"Louisiana Purchase\" with Bob Hope, and dancing to \"That Old Black Magic\" in Paramount Pictures' \"Star Spangled Rhythm\".\n\nZorina was born in Berlin, Germany. Her father Fritz Hartwig was a German lapsed Roman Catholic, and her mother Abigail Johanne Wimpelmann (known as Billie Hartwig) was Norwegian and Lutheran. Both were professional singers. Young Eva was brought up in a small coastal town between Trondheim and Bergen, called Kristiansund North, where she debuted as a dancer at the Festiviteten, the oldest opera house in Norway. She received her education at the Lyceum for Girls in Berlin and was trained in dance by Olga Preobrajenska and Nicholas Legat.\n\nAt age 12, she was presented to Max Reinhardt, who cast her in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1929) and \"Tales of Hoffman\" (1931). A performance at London's Gaiety Theatre won her an invitation to join the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1933, at which time she adopted the stage name of Vera Zorina. The company only wanted Russian names and she was given a list of 20 and chose the last name because she could pronounce it. A few years later, she attained a lead role in the London production of \"On Your Toes\" (1937) and was seen by American film producer Samuel Goldwyn, who signed her to a seven-year film contract. She appeared in seven Hollywood movies between 1938 and 1946.\nWhen she lost the role of Maria in \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" after only two weeks shooting, her film career came to a halt. The Hollywood axe fell on her when David O. Selznick, co-star Gary Cooper, director Sam Wood, and Ernest Hemingway all preferred Ingrid Bergman.\n\nOne of her major stage roles was in the 1938 Rodgers and Hart musical \"I Married an Angel.\" As the title character, she played an exquisite angel who descended from heaven to marry a Hungarian banker played by Dennis King, but whose complete lack of human guile presented him with a whole new set of problems. (Jeanette MacDonald had that role in the film version.)\n\nIn 1945, she had great success as Ariel in William Shakespeares \"The Tempest\" at the Alvin Theatre (now named Neil Simon Theatre) on Broadway. Starting in 1948, Zorina appeared in Arthur Honegger's \"Joan of Arc at the Stake\", playing the title role in the first American performance with the New York Philharmonic under Charles Münch. She subsequently commanded the role many times, notably in the recorded performance from the Royal Festival Hall in June 1966, with the London Symphony Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa. In 1968, she directed \"Cabaret\" at the Oslo Nye Teater to great acclaim. Her farewell performance was in Perséphone with New York City Ballet in 1982. In the 1970s, Vera Zorina was appointed director of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet (\"Den Norske Opera & Ballet\"), but withdrew before she officially settled in because of her husband's illness.\n\nShe was active with Lincoln Center as an adviser and director and, for several seasons, directed operas at the Santa Fe Opera in New Mexico. In 1986, she completed \"Zorina\", her autobiography.\n\nZorina was married in 1938 to choreographer George Balanchine (her first marriage and his second marriage); the couple divorced in 1946. She danced in productions he choreographed for both stage and screen, including \"On Your Toes,\" a Broadway hit later adapted for the screen by Lawrence Riley.\n\nFrom 1946 her second husband was Columbia Records president Goddard Lieberson until his death on May 29, 1977. They had two sons: Peter Lieberson, a composer, and Jonathan Lieberson. Her final marriage in 1991 was to harpsichordist Paul Wolfe until her death in 2003 at age 86 of undisclosed causes.\n\nZorina was the grandmother of sisters Elizabeth (Lizzie), Katherine, and Kristina Lieberson, who are now members of the band TEEN.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his role as \"Strop\" in \"The Paul Hogan Show\", and he was instrumental in the introduction of World Series Cricket in 1977.\n\nAs a journalist, Cornell reported on local events in Perth for \"The Daily News\" (a publication of West Australian Newspapers).\n\nIn 1971, while working as a producer for the television show \"A Current Affair\", Cornell recognized the talents of a Sydney Harbour Bridge rigger, Paul Hogan (who had been the subject of an interview by the station). Cornell became Hogan's manager and often appeared alongside him in his popular television show, \"The Paul Hogan Show\", as a character called \"Strop\" (a dim-witted dinkum Australian surf lifesaver). He produced and co-wrote the screenplay for Hogan's 1986 film \"Crocodile Dundee\" which became the highest grossing Australian film. He also produced and directed the successful 1988 sequel, \"Crocodile Dundee II\".\n\nCornell worked closely with Kerry Packer and Austin Robertson in setting up World Series Cricket (WSC) in 1977. Based on a suggestion in 1976 by Dennis Lillee (whom Cornell was managing at the time), Cornell presented the idea to Kerry Packer—primarily with the aim of providing better financial rewards to the players. Cornell was actively involved in the recruitment of players for WSC, for example travelling to New Zealand to sign players (including Doug Walters). Cornell engaged the Mojo agency to produce radio and television advertisements to promote WSC—including the production of the jingle \"C'mon Aussie C'mon\".\n\nCornell was born in Kalgoorlie, but grew up in Bunbury in Western Australia. He states that he was considered a \"ratbag\" at school, but he topped the class in both English and economics at Bunbury High.\n\nCornell married Australian television personality Delvene Delaney in 1977, and they have two children: Allira and Liana. He was married twice before, and has a daughter from one of those marriages (Melissa, born in 1970).\n\nUntil its sale for a record price of $65 million in 2007, Cornell owned the Beach Hotel in Byron Bay (which he had built for $9 million in 1990).\n\nCornell suffers from Parkinson's disease and has undergone deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms. The disease had rendered Cornell largely immobile; however, treatment by Peter Silburn at St Andrew's War Memorial Hospital in Brisbane enabled him to \"enjoy 2km walks with his wife\".\n\nCornell and Paul Hogan were investigated for alleged tax evasion as part of the Australian Taxation Office's Project Wickenby which commenced in 2004. They were also investigated by the Australian Crime Commission \"over the use of offshore accounts to bank royalties from the Crocodile Dundee films\" (with both denying any dishonest conduct). They were later cleared of any wrongdoing by the ACC. In 2012 Hogan and Cornell confirmed that they had settled the eight-year dispute with the ATO.\n\nCornell has been involved in various roles in the following projects:\n\nCitations\nSources\n"}

The latter are often referred to as \"college ops\".\n\nOCS is a rigorous 12-week course designed to train, assess, evaluate, and develop second lieutenants for sixteen of the U.S. Army's seventeen basic branches. It is the only commissioning source that can be responsive to the U.S. Army's changing personnel requirements due to its short length, compared to other commissioning programs and their requirements.

Prior to 1973, OCS was branch-specific, at one time there being eight separate schools; by 1968, the Army had consolidated OCS. Candidates being commissioned in the combat support branches were sent to Fort Belvoir, Virginia and would be trained as Combat Engineer Officers. Upon graduation, they would be commissioned in their assigned branch and sent to an officers basic course. Candidates being commissioned in the combat arms branches, would be sent to Infantry OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia or possibly Artillery OCS at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. At that time, OCS consisted of twenty-two weeks of classroom and field training. The Vietnam war brought a significant expansion of the program. In 1973, OCS was made branch immaterial and was consolidated into two courses taught at Ft. Benning, and another at Fort McClellan, Alabama for female Officer Candidates; the course length was reduced to 14-weeks. In 1976, the OCS at Ft. Benning integrated females, and became the only OCS left in the active Army, with the closure of the WAC School. The term \"90-day wonders\", both as a pejorative and term of affection, has been intermittently applied to junior officers commissioned through OCS since World War II.\n\nOfficer Candidate School was first proposed in June 1938, as the Army began expanding in anticipation of hostilities when a plan for an officer-training program was submitted to the Chief of Infantry by Brigadier General Asa L. Singleton, Commandant of the Infantry School. No action was taken until July 1940, however, when Brig. Gen. Courtney Hodges, Assistant Commandant of the Infantry School, presented a revised plan to (then) Brig. Gen. Omar Bradley, Commandant of the Infantry School. In July 1941, the OCS stood up as the Infantry, Field Artillery, and Coastal Artillery Officer Candidate Schools, each respectively located at Fort Benning, Fort Sill, and Fort Monroe, Virginia. In addition to the aforementioned programs, there were Officer Candidate Schools stood up for other branches, in particular the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Due to the rapid creation of these programs because of wartime necessity, and then the rapid closures or restructuring soon after the end of the war, historical records were not always created or adequately maintained and little is known about some of these branch specific commissioning courses. The Signal Corps however has a full list of records going back to its very first class, which graduated 336 Officers on 30 September 1941. The records are maintained by the U.S. Army Signal Corps OCS Association, which is actively collecting and archiving the personal history of many of the over 27,000 Signal Corps OCS graduates that went through its WWII, Korean War and Vietnam War programs. The Signal Corps website includes a list of every U.S. Army Signal Corps OCS graduate, the date of their graduation, as well as all TAC Officers, training school CO's, and most enlisted men who served the Signal Corps' OCS training programs. In addition to the Signal Corps, several other units have alumni organizations that have maintained informal records and preserved documentation of the courses.\n\nOn 27 September 1941, the first Infantry OCS class graduated 171 second lieutenants; 204 men started the 17-week course in July. Testament to the ability of OCS to produce new second lieutenants quickly can be found in War Department decision that ROTC could not fulfill the national demand for officers; so in May 1943, the advanced course in ROTC was suspended and basic course graduates were immediately sent to OCS so they could be commissioned sooner.\n\nDuring the war, the Army's policy of racial segregation continued among enlisted members; Army training policy, however, provided that blacks and whites would train together in officer candidate schools (beginning in 1942). Officer Candidate School was the Army's first formal experiment with integration. Black and white candidates shared officer's quarters, with bunkmates assigned alphabetically, regardless of their race, and all of the candidates trained together. Despite this integrated training, in most instances, the graduates would go on to join racially segregated units. \n\nGeneral Bradley is credited with establishing the format, discipline, and code of honor still used in OCS today. Bradley emphasized rigorous training, strict discipline and efficient organization. These tenets remain the base values of today's Officer Candidate School. Between July 1941 and May 1947, over 100,000 candidates were enrolled in 448 Infantry OCS classes, of these approximately 67 percent completed the course to earn commissions. After World War II, Infantry OCS was transferred to Fort Riley, Kansas, as part of the Ground General School. Due to the post-war downsizing of the Army and the declining need for new Officers, all but Infantry OCS was closed. Finally, on 1 November 1947, it was deactivated. The final class graduated only 52 second lieutenants.\n\nThe Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was created by act of Congress on 14 May 1942, permitting them to serve, but not as Soldiers. At that time, women did not have military status and were not integrated into the Army. Their ranks, pay, and benefits were different than the Army, along with all administration. But, being a military organization that was modeled after, and parallel, to the Army, it required a way to train Officers; therefore it created its own WAAC OCS, which stood up on 20 July 1942 at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. The course was six-weeks long, its first class consisting of 440 candidates. Upon graduation, the women were commissioned as third officers (equivalent to a second lieutenant). It is worth noting, that among the first candidates were 40 black women. Initially, black women were segregated, but in keeping with Army policies, integrating officer training, and with pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), by November 1942, they were being trained in integrated units.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Korean War, and the Army's rapid expansion in response, the shortage of on-hand officers, and projected commissions, caused the Department of the Army to re-open Infantry OCS at Ft. Benning on 18 February 1951. The course was lengthened from 17 to 22 weeks, as a result of lessons learned from WWII; thus permitting more instruction in Infantry tactics. The Infantry Officer Candidate School became the \"1st Officer Candidate Battalion, 2nd Student Regiment.\" The strength of OCS rapidly increased. As one of eight branch programs, Infantry OCS included as many as 29 companies with a class graduating every week. During the Korean War, OCS commissioned approximately 7,000 Infantry officers.\n\nIn April 1949, the U.S. Army established the Women's Army Corps Officer Candidate School at Fort Lee, Virginia. The WAC, an active component of the regular Army, descendant of the WAAC, operated this OCS for females seeking to enter the WAC Officer Corps. The \"wash-out\" rate was nearly identical to the men's programs, at roughly 37%, during its first four years; an alarming statistic to observers of both programs. By 1954 WAC OCS had been closed and merged with a commissioning program for female direct commissionees, due to the low numbers of women attending the WAC OCS course, due in part to tightened standards for selection – in response to investigations of the washout rates.\n\nOn 4 August 1953, the Department of the Army reduced OCS from eight to three programs: Infantry, Artillery, and Engineer, finally closing Engineer OCS in July 1954, leaving only the Infantry and Field Artillery schools open. With the onset of the Vietnam War, however, the OCS program was again expanded with officer candidates undergoing a grueling 23-week program of instruction with an extremely high attrition rate which was designed to prepare young officers to be platoon leaders in a demanding Vietnam jungle environment. In September 1965, Engineer OCS reopened at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and before closing for good in 1971, over 10,000 Engineer Officers had been commissioned.\n\nAs the war in Korea edged into 1953, several classes of Infantry School OCS students were given authorization to transfer to the Medical Service Corps upon graduation. These selected officers (with previous medical experience) were assigned to Korea (after a short training course at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas), with the explicit duty of trying to keep the direct inductee Medical Officers alive. This was necessary because of the shortage of medical officers and the lack of combat preparation training provided to them after their direct induction into the Army and their immediate assignment to Korea.\n\nAt the height of the Vietnam War, Infantry OCS produced 7,000 officers annually from five student battalions, all located at Ft. Benning. Also, during the war, a female OCS was once again established; it was stood up at Fort McClellan, Alabama, as part of the WAC Center and School. Other OCS programs were located at Fort Gordon, Georgia (Signal Corps); Fort Sill, Oklahoma (Artillery), Fort Lee, Virginia (Quarter Master), Fort Eustis, Virginia (Transportation), Fort Knox, Kentucky (Armor), Fort Belvoir, Virginia (Engineer) and Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (Ordnance). In April 1973, a branch immaterial OCS was established at Fort Benning, ending the Infantry and Field Artillery based courses. In 1976, with the end of the gender separate Army, the women's OCS was merged with the branch immaterial male course, creating a program very similar to the modern OCS. The United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, also admitted its first female cadets in 1976. However, due to the length of instruction there (4 years), the newly gender-integrated Officer Candidate School had the distinction of commissioning a female second lieutenant before USMA.\n\n\nToday, Officer Candidate school is offered in two ways. Active duty OCS is a 12-week-long school, taught \"in residence\" at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Its primary purpose is to commission Second Lieutenants into the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard.\n\nThe Army's Officer Candidate School is programmed to teach basic leadership and Soldier tasks, using the Infantry battle drills found in Army Field Manual 3–21.8 as a framework for instruction and evaluation of leadership potential. A total of 71 tasks are taught and tested while at OCS. A candidate should expect to be under constant observation and evaluation by their cadre. Mental and emotional stress is induced through a variety of controlled methods, to test problem solving and moral resolve. Additionally, the course is meant to be physically demanding, with numerous tactical road marches, timed runs of varying distance from 2 miles to 5 miles, and Army Combatives training. Beginning with the first class of FY 2008, the calendar length of OCS was shortened from 14 weeks to 12 weeks, thus allowing for more classes to be conducted each fiscal year, thereby raising the maximum capacity of the school to train Second Lieutenants to meet future commissioning needs as the Army grows. The current capacity of each class that is conducted is limited to 160 Officer Candidates.\n\nOfficer Candidate School is conducted in three phases: Basic phase, Intermediate Phase, and Senior phase. Students are referred to as either Basic Officer Candidates (BOCs), Intermediate Officer Candidates (IOCs), or Senior Officer Candidates (SOCs) as their classes progress. Initially, upon arrival, the candidates will in-process with HHC and compete via Physical Fitness test to enter an OCS company. Candidates should expect to arrive at Ft. Benning in top physical condition as the cutoff has historically been an APFT score of 240–270. Once assigned to a class, the candidates have virtually no privileges and enter into a highly controlled environment similar to Basic Training, although they are expected to act like leaders and take charge and responsibility immediately. As they progress through the course, they may earn some limited privileges. Their bearing, deportment, and behavior, both individually and collectively, will affect the return of their privileges.\n\nBasic Officer Candidates (BOCs) are identified by wearing a Black ascot. Basic phase will test candidates academically as well as physically; all events are scored comprising the Order of Merit (OML) list used for branch selection. Basic Officer phase culminates with branch selection and phase over to Intermediate phase. The Intermediate Officer Candidates (IOCs) are identified with a light blue ascot. The intermediate phase continues with more difficult academic training as well as field and tactical instruction. Senior Officer Candidates (SOCs) are identified by wearing a white ascot. Senior phase consists of a field environment where students are graded on land navigation, tactics, and leadership; the last phase consists of final exams in academics, physical fitness, peer evaluations, final TAC (Training, Advising, and Counseling) Officer assessments, interviews, and preparation for graduation and follow-on basic officer branch courses. Sometimes, graduates are offered 'walk-on' slots in Fort Benning's Airborne or Air Assault schools since they are under the same higher training command as OCS.\n\nIn September 2010, OCS implemented a policy of total immersion. This system removes the possibility of candidates earning on- or off-post passes and using their vehicles during the first 6 weeks of school, restricts the consumption of alcohol to 2 designated days during the course, and prohibits students to carry cell phones while in uniform.\n\nAll candidates are commissioned as second lieutenants upon graduation.\n\nThe programs at the Army National Guard Regional Training Institutes are offered in two different formats to accommodate reserve component soldiers. The \"Traditional\" OCS program is a 16-month course of instruction conducted from April to August of the following year and is broken down into four phases.\nThe Army National Guard also offers an \"Accelerated\" OCS program, which is a 56-day, full-time program. The accelerated program is the most physically and mentally demanding program and while the majority of candidates for the accelerated program are already enlisted soldiers, the failure rate is consistently over 40%.\n\nUpon successful completion of either Army National Guard OCS program, graduates are eligible for commissioning as a second lieutenant pending federal recognition. This is normally the only possibility of attaining an officer's commission without the prerequisite of having a bachelor's degree. There are, however, requirements that allow basic qualification for entrance into Officer Candidate School for the Army Reserves. However, as the Army's needs for junior grade officers ebbs and flows, the requirement for a degree may be added as a temporary measure. This will be announced to the force via an Army G1 MILPER message. The Army Regulation (AR) that governs OCS is AR 350–51. These include having at least 90 credits from an accredited college, approval from the Officer Candidate School board, and falling in the age range of 18 to 41 years.\n\nIn 2009, the Army streamlined the Officer training pipeline by removing BOLC II and renaming BOLC I to BOLC-A and BOLC III to BOLC-B. Three weeks of training were added to BOLC-B which includes basic soldiering skills such as land navigation and weapons qualification. Thus, three separate schools were combined into two. Today's 'BOLC' was formerly known as the Officer Basic Course (OBC).\n\nOfficer Candidates must pass a series of test before being accepted into the Officer Candidate School. A prospective Officer Candidate will meet with a recruiter. After the initial interview the recruiter will decide if the prospective Officer Candidate should move forward in the process. It is up to the individual recruiter to decide if a prospective Officer Candidate can pass the OCS program successfully and is worth the time and effort it takes to submit a packet for OCS.\n\nAfter completing the initial interview the prospective Officer Candidate will take the ASVAB and need to make at least a 110 GT score. The prospective candidate then must complete a short essay about why they want to be an Army Officer, provide identification (usually a birth certificate and Social Security card), pass a background check, provide a minimum of 3 letters of recommendation, and complete a physical medical exam.\n\nAfter successful completion of these steps, the recruiter may then conduct the Officer Candidate through an Army Physical Fitness Test. Upon reaching a score on the test that the recruiter deems to be acceptable (usually in the range of 270 and above), the Officer Candidate will be scheduled to conduct an interview board. The interview board is conducted by three Officers, usually two Captains and headed by a Major. Upon successfully passing the interview board the prospective Officer Candidate is accepted into the program and has a week to sign the contract.\n\nThe U.S. Army Officer Candidate School Hall of Honor was established in 1958 to honor Infantry Officer graduates of the Officer Candidate School Program who distinguished themselves in military or civilian pursuits. In 2002, it was opened to graduates from all U.S. Army Officer Candidate Schools from across the history of the U.S. Army. It is hosted at the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia, which also hosts the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Honor.\n\nAmong the OCS Hall of Honor exhibits include the OCS Hall of Fame. It features over 2,000 inductees whom's biographies and portraits can be explored in a digital kiosk.\n\nSelection and induction into the Hall of Fame is not guaranteed and is based on several criteria. The inductee may be commissioned from any active component Army OCS program and must have accomplished at least one of the following:\n\nThere are over two thousand inductees; a few representative examples are listed here: OCS Hall of Fame FT Benning Georgia, 2019\n\nThe United States Army Officer Candidate Schools Alumni Association (USAOCSAA) : is the Alumni Association for the United States Army Officer Candidate Schools (OCS) Past, Present and Future regardless of location and includes Army National Guard OCS. It is incorporated in the State of Georgia as a 501 C(19) Not For Profit, War Veterans Organization. It is led by 13 Directors all Graduates, 5 of which form the executive committee. The executive committee is led by the President & Chief Executive Officer who acts as the Executive Director. The current President & Chief Executive Officer is Colonel (Ret.) Frank L Harman III\n\nThe mission of the Association is to serve and honor the OCS program and its graduates; and its purpose is to further the ideals and promote the welfare of the Officer Candidate Schools, the Officer Corps and the US Army.\n\nUSAOCSAA supports the OCS Battalion and the OCS Program by sponsoring each OCS Class with resources to assist with class events and graduation awards. USAOCSAA also sponsors major events, annual awards and ceremonies and facilities on the OCS Campus which include the Annual OCS Alumni Reunion, the Patterson Award, the OCS Hall of Fame, the OCS Memorial Walk and the OCS Heritage Center in Wigle Hall. USAOCSAA acknowledges and recognizes alumni and Cadre with Monuments in the OCS Memorial Walk, Decorating National War memorials in the National Mall and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Award of the Order of Saint Maurice, Distinguished and Honorary Members of the 11th Infantry Regiment and the annual Colonel Robert Nett Award. USAOCSAA communicates with its members and educates the public on the vital role of OCS by operating the USAOCSAA Web Site [OCSalumni.org] and provides articles to national publications, as well as provides a Quarterly Newsletter and Bi-Weekly Email Updates to its members.\n\nThe purpose of the Nett Award is \"to remember and continue to honor the service of Colonel Robert B. Nett to our country, the Army, and the OCS program\" and \"to recognize and honor annually an OCS Hall of Fame or OCS Alumni Association member or current and former cadre who has provided superior support and advocacy to the OCS program\". The Nett Award is presented by the USAOCSAA president and the Senior Maneuver Center representative at the USAOCSAA alumni dinner.\n\nThe criterion is: \"the nominee, through years of continued service, support, and action, best represents and has contributed to the OCS Alumni Association mission and purpose\".\n\nRecipients of the award are as follows:\n\nThe school's alma mater is:\n<poem>\nFar across the Chattahoochee\nTo the Upatoi\nOCS our Alma Mater\nBenning’s pride and joy!\n\nForward ever backward never\nFaithfully we strive\nTo the ports of embarkation\nFollow me with pride.\n\nWhen it's time and we are called\nTo guard our country's might\nWe'll be there with head held high\nin peacetime and in fight.\n\nYearning ever, failing never\nTo guard the memory\nThe call is clear, we meet the task\nFor freedom’s never free!</poem>\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1877126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877126", "title": "House of Dadeshkeliani", "text": "House of Dadeshkeliani\n\nThe Dadeshkeliani or Dadishkeliani () was an aristocratic family from the mountainous western Georgian province of Svaneti. They ruled the Principality of Svaneti from the 1720s to 1857.\n\nAlthough the Dadeshkeliani themselves claimed the descent from the Shamkhal dynasty of Tarki, in Dagestan, historic evidence shows that they were spun off from the House of Gelovani, a princely dynasty of Svaneti known since the 11th century. One princess of the Gelovani family is said to have survived the destruction of her clan by the princes Dadiani, who usurped the Principality of Svaneti in the mid-17th century, and to have fled to Kabarda in the North Caucasus. Her eldest son, called Dadesh, married into a local princely family and his name was later transformed into a separate family name locally pronounced as Dadeshkeliani. His descendants were able to return to Svaneti to reclaim the domain from the Dadiani, attaining to the principate of Svaneti in the 1720s for the second time.\nSince then, the Gelovani ruled the Lower Svaneti, whilst the Dadeshkelian - the Upper Svaneti. In the 1820s, the Principality of Svaneti effectively split into two as a result of a blood feud between the rival Dadeshkeliani branches. Through the mediation by the princes of Mingrelia, both branches accepted nominal Russian suzerainty in 1833. Nevertheless, they continued to run their affairs independently and did not allow Russian officials or church missions into the area until the late 1840s.\n\nContinuing dynastic strife among the Dadishkeliani, their defiance to the Russian government, and vacillation during the Crimean War (1854-1856), however, led to direct Russian intervention. In 1857, Prince Alexander Baryatinsky, Viceroy of the Caucasus, ordered Svaneti to be subdued by armed force. The prince of Svaneti, Constantine, chose to negotiate, but was ordered into exile to Erivan. On a farewell audience in Kutaisi, he quarreled with a local Russian administrator, Alexander Gagarin, and stabbed to death him and three of his staff. When captured, Constantine was summarily tried by court martial and shot. In 1858, the principality was abolished and converted into a district administered by a Russian-appointed officer (\"pristav\"). Several members of the Dadeshekeliani family were exiled to the remote Russian provinces and those who remained in Georgia were deprived of their privileges of autonomous princes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1877128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877128", "title": "Ribeiroia", "text": "Ribeiroia\n\nRibeiroia () is a genus of trematode parasites that sequentially infect freshwater snails in the family Planorbidae (ramshorn snails) as first intermediate hosts, fish and larval amphibians as second intermediate hosts, and birds and mammals as definitive hosts (see ). In North America, infection by \"Ribeiroia\" has been linked to amphibians with limb malformations. The connection between parasitic infection and limb malformations has generated questions about (a) whether parasite-induced malformations in amphibians are increasing (see ), and (b) the consequences of such abnormalities for amphibian population conservation (see ).\n\n\"Ribeiroia\" is a genus of parasites in the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. Currently three species and one subspecies of \"Ribeiroia\" are recognized: \"R. ondatrae\" in North America, \"R. marini\" in the Caribbean, \"R. m. guadeloupensis\" on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, and \"R. congolensis\" in Africa (Johnson et al. 2004). The trematode \"Cercaria lileta\" is also closely related to \"Ribeiroia\", and molecular sequence data indicates that it may be a species of \"Ribeiroia\" (Johnson et al. 2004). All species of \"Ribeiroia\" share the distinctive morphological characteristic of esophageal diverticula (i.e., two short dead-end branches that extend laterally from the esophagus). Other genera closely related to \"Ribeiroia\" include \"Cladocystis trifolium\", \"Cathemasia\", and \"Echinostoma\" (Johnson et al. 2004). See Johnson et al. (2004) for more details on morphological and ecological differences as well as phylogenetic relationships between these species.\n\n\"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" has an indirect complex life cycle. The adult worms live inside predatory birds or mammals (the definitive hosts), wherein they reproduce sexually if other worms are present. Mature adults release eggs into the host’s intestinal tract, which are passed with the feces of the host, and to develop need to end up in water. The eggs typically develop in 2–3 weeks, but the time varies depending on water temperature. Eggs hatch into miracidia, a ciliated free-living parasite stage, which infect the first intermediate host, ram’s horn snails in the family Planorbidae, colonizing the snail’s reproductive tissue and eventually forming rediae, a slow-moving worm-like parasite stage. The rediae reproduce asexually, castrating the snail as they feed on its reproductive tissue. The infection becomes mature in about six weeks, when the rediae within the snail begin to release a second free-swimming stage called cercariae. The key identifying characteristic of \"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" cercariae is the bifurcated esophagus (although this trait can occur in some closely related genera such as \"Cladocystis trifolium\"). Cercariae infect amphibians or fish (the second intermediate hosts) wherein they encyst in (with amphibians) the limb buds or (with fish) along the lateral line and scales of the head, body and gills. Encysted cercariae become metacercariae, a dormant parasite stage with a thin outer membrane. Metacercariae resemble cercariae without their tails and do not reproduce. The definitive hosts (birds and mammals) become infected when they consume an amphibian or fish that has encysted metacercariae. The life cycle is completed when the metacercariae emerge from their cyst and attach to the definitive host’s intestinal tract and develop into adults, typically in the proventriculus of birds and the stomach of mammals.\n\nExperimental exposure to \"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" cercariae has been shown to cause limb malformations in various frog, toad and salamander species, including \"Pseudacris regilla, Anaxyrus boreas, Lithobates pipiens, A. americanus, Ambystoma macrodactylum, L. clamitans\" and \"L. sylvatica\". Cercariae appear to prefer to infect in and around the developing limb buds of larval amphibians, which can alter or inhibit limb development. The risk of malformation and mortality varies as a function of parasite exposure level, host development stage, and the amphibian species involved. As expected for macroparasitic infections, a dose-dependent relationship exists between cercariae exposure and pathology, particularly among larval amphibians at pre- or early-limb development stage. Cercarial penetration of host tissue involves proteolytic enzymes. The exact mechanism which alters limb development is unknown, but potential pathways include mechanical disturbance by invading parasites, release of a teratogenic chemical by parasites, or a combination of the two.\n\nSusceptibility to infection and the subsequent pathology differs among amphibian species. For example, gray tree frogs (\"Hyla versicolor\") are largely resistant to infection, but toads (e.g. \"A. americanus\") exhibit high frequencies of mortality and malformations following parasite exposure (Johnson and Hartson 2009). The types of limb malformations also vary among species and developmental stage of exposure. The most common errors in development associated with \"Ribeiroia\" exposure are skin webbings (cutaneous fusion), missing limbs and limb elements (ectromelia and hemimelia), supernumerary limbs and digits (polymelia and polydactyly), and bony triangles. The factors determining variation in susceptibility among species remain poorly understood. However these observations suggest that the type of malformation alone is unlikely to be diagnostic of \"Ribeiroia\" exposure.\n\n\"Ribeiroia\" infection has been linked to malformations in naturally occurring amphibian populations, especially in the western and midwestern US. In a large-scale study in the western US, both the presence and abundance of \"Ribeiroia\" infection predicted higher-than-baseline (e.g. >5%) frequencies of abnormalities in one or more amphibian species. Limb malformations were observed in nine species and ranged in frequency from <5% to nearly 90%. The role of \"Ribeiroia\" in explaining accounts of amphibian malformations in other regions is varied; \"Ribeiroia\" has been associated with malformation \"hotspots\" in the midwestern and northeastern US, but it was not detected in malformation surveys from Vermont, Alaska, Bermuda, and Michigan.\n\n\"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" is widely distributed across the US, including records from 22 species in 37 states (Johnson and McKenzie 2008). Most records of \"Ribeiroia\"-associated malformations have been reported from California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Less is known about the distribution of \"Ribeiroia\" in Canada and Central America. In amphibians, both the abundance of the parasite and the number of observations appear to correlate positively with major bird migratory flyways, with concentrations along the Pacific, Mississippi, and Atlantic flyways (Johnson et al. 2010). This observation suggests definitive (bird) host activity is an important determinant of parasite distribution at the continental scale, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. \"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" is most often recovered from amphibians in lentic habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands, which support planorbid snails. Other species of Ribeiroia occur in the Caribbean and South America (\"R. marini\" and \"R. marini guadeloupensis\") and in Africa (\"R. congolensis\"). However, whether these species infect amphibians or cause limb malformations has not been explored.\n\nDating back over 200 years, there have been reports of amphibian malformations suggesting that the general phenomenon is not a new occurrence in amphibian populations (Ouellet 2000). Despite the historical occurrence of amphibian malformations, the real question is whether such malformations are increasing in prevalence and severity in wild amphibian populations. Limited historical data on malformations and the absence of baseline malformation data has complicated attempts to assess whether malformations are emerging. However, research over the past decade has shown that malformations are emerging in some amphibian populations. For example, the background rate of malformations of northern leopard frogs in Minnesota increased from 0.4% in 1958–1963 to 2.5% in 1996–1997 (Hoppe 2000), with recently observed malformations more severe and more diverse. Similarly, Johnson and Lunde (2005), in a comparison of recent (1990–2000) and historical (1899–1989) publications, found that recent reports document:\n\n\nFor both of these studies, however, the mechanisms driving the apparent increase in malformations were not identified (see Factors influencing emergence). In a more rigorous study, Johnson et al. (2003) confirmed that historical malformations at six of eight sites (1947–1990) were associated with \"Ribeiroia\" infection. Moreover, three of these sites continued to support limb malformations at frequencies of 7-50% in one or more species. One pond in particular (Jette Pond in western Montana) showed increased prevalence of malformations in \"Pseudacris regila\" from 20% in 1960 to 46% in 2000, which was correlated with an increased intensity of \"Ribeiroia\" infection. Although more research is necessary, these studies provide evidence that malformations, especially those linked to \"Ribeiroia\" infection, are emerging in some amphibian populations.\n\nNutrients - Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment are widespread forms of anthropogenic environmental change that may influence parasite infection (Johnson and Carpenter 2008). Nutrient enrichment leads to eutrophication, which has been linked with emergence of \"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" through direct and indirect effects on aquatic food webs (Johnson and Chase 2004). The underlying mechanism through which eutrophication can increase infection involves increasing the density of infected first-intermediate snail hosts and by increasing the production of parasites by infected snails (Johnson et al. 2007).\n\nPesticides - Pesticides are still considered a potential factor influencing amphibian malformations (Johnson et al. 2010). However, recent investigations have focused on the interaction of pesticides with parasite infection (Kiesecker 2002; Rohr et al. 2008). Field experiments indicated a link between agricultural run-off and increased infection (Kiesecker 2002). Laboratory studies further demonstrated that pesticide exposure reduced host immunocompetence against parasites as the biological mechanism (Kiesecker 2002). Furthermore, there may be a link between nutrient addition and pesticide contamination jointly leading to increased infections by simultaneously increasing exposure and suppressing host immune systems (Rohr et al. 2008a, b).\n\nBiodiversity - Host species diversity and community structure have been suggested to influence disease dynamics through a hypothesis termed the ‘dilution effect’ (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000). For \"Ribeiroia ondatrae\", host species differences in susceptibility can influence infection patterns in multi-species communities (Johnson et al. 2008, Johnson and Hartson 2009). As a result, more diverse larval amphibian communities that include species with differing susceptibilities can alter parasite infection success and the resulting pathology in sensitive host species. For instance, larval toads (a sensitive species) raised experimentally alongside larval gray treefrogs (a resistant species) exhibited 37% less infection and fewer malformations (Johnson et al. 2008).\n\nPerhaps the most unexplored, complex and vital aspects of trematode-caused amphibian malformations are the population-level consequences. Do these parasites and the malformations they induce pose a conservation risk? While no direct evidence linking trematode deformities and amphibian population declines exists, there are legitimate reasons for concern (Johnson and McKenzie 2008). For instance, in multiple species of frogs and toads, laboratory studies show that even low levels of \"Ribeiroia\" infection can induce 30-95% mortality (see Johnson et al. 2010). Correspondingly, multi-year field studies show that in localities of high infection and malformations in metamorphosing frogs, <2% of amphibians returning to breed exhibit malformations, suggesting \"Ribeiroia\" infection and malformations have deleterious consequences for individual survival and fecundity (Johnson et al. 2001). In specific wetlands that have historically exhibited a high prevalence of infection and malformations, several amphibian species have notably declined or disappeared (see Johnson and McKenzie 2008 for review). In light of these data, and the increasing evidence that \"Ribeiroia\" infections are on the rise (Johnson and McKenzie 2008), it is prudent to treat \"Ribeiroia ondatrae\" as a threat to amphibian populations and diversity, particularly in combination with other stressors.\n\n\n"}

However, he was instrumental in establishing Likud in July 1973 by uniting most of the right-wing parties in the country; Gahal, the Free Centre, the National List and the Movement for Greater Israel. Sharon was elected to the Knesset in the December 1973 elections on Likud's list, but retired from the Knesset just under a year later.\n\nFrom June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Alignment Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. However, with the 1977 elections looming, Sharon tried to return to the Likud and replace Menachem Begin at the head of the party. He suggested to Simkha Erlikh, who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more fitting than Begin to win an election victory, but he was rejected. Following this he tried to join the Alignment and then the centrist Dash, but was turned down by both.\n\nAfter his triple snub, Sharon resorted to forming his own party, Shlomtzion. The new party won two seats in the election, taken by Sharon and Yitzhak Yitzhaky.

He is notable for winning a series of major races in 1999 and 2000 including the Dubai World Cup. He died after contracting grass sickness at the age of five.\n\nDubai Millennium was foaled on 20 March 1996 at the Dalham Hall Stud. He was by the Mr. Prospector stallion Seeking The Gold, out of the Prix de Pomone winner Colorado Dancer. Apart from Dubai Millennium, Seeking the Gold sired the winners of 27 Group One/Grade I races including Pleasant Home, Jazil, and Bob and John Colorado Dancer was a daughter of Fall Aspen, a highly successful broodmare who produced eight winners of Group/Graded races including Preakness Stakes winner Timber Country.\n\nDubai Millennium was originally sent into training with David Loder at Newmarket and was ridden in all but one of his races by Frankie Dettori.\n\nHe was initially named Yaazer (meaning \"white gazelle\"), but Sheikh Mohammed, owner of Godolphin, renamed the colt Dubai Millennium after he was identified as the most promising of his two-year-old colts.\n\nDubai Millennium made his debut as a two-year-old at Yarmouth in October 1998. He started odds-on favourite and won by five lengths despite being eased down by jockey Frankie Dettori in the closing stages.\n\nAt the end of the year, Dubai Millennium was transferred to the stable of Saeed Bin Suroor and wintered at the Godolphin training facility in Dubai.\n\nDuring the winter, he began to appear in the betting list for the following year's Derby, although some felt that his name was the main reason for the attention.\n\nDubai Millennium began his three-year-old season at Doncaster in May, where he was \"impressive\" in leading from the start and winning by nine lengths. On his next start, he was moved up in class and distance for the Listed Predominate Stakes over a mile and a quarter at Goodwood, a recognised trial for the Derby. Accompanied by a large Godolphin entourage and looking \"magnificent\", he started at odds of 4/11. In the race, he moved to take the lead two furlongs from home and went clear to win by three and a half lengths. Immediately afterwards, his connections expressed no worries about the Derby distance, although some concern was expressed about the possibility of firm ground, which was felt to be unsuitable for such a big, heavily built horse.\n\nDubai Millennium was reported to have thrived after Goodwood and was sent to Epsom for the Derby, where he was made favourite, although his starting price of 5/1 reflected the open nature of a race in which many lightly raced, untested colts were entered. He pulled hard early on, and after making a brief effort early in the straight, finished ninth of the sixteen runners, beaten just over nine lengths by Oath. It was his only defeat and the only time he was tried over the mile and a half distance.\n\nFollowing the Derby, Dubai Millennium was campaigned over shorter races for the rest of the season. In July, he was sent to France for the Group Two Prix Eugène Adam at Maisons-Laffitte and led from the start to win \"unchallenged\" by three lengths.\n\nHopes that he would be matched against Royal Anthem in the International Stakes were not fulfilled as he was instead brought back to one mile for the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville. On heavy, rain-softened ground he once again led all the way and \"surged\" clear in the closing stages to beat the Grand Prix de Paris winner Slickly by two and a half lengths. The leading French colt Sendawar was withdrawn because of the soft ground. After the race, Dettori called Dubai Millennium \"a champion\".\n\nOn his final start of the year, in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot, he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and pulled clear to win by six lengths. After the race, Sheikh Mohammed made clear his view that Dubai Millennium was the best horse ever prepared by his Godolphin organisation and that he would be aimed at the following year's Dubai World Cup.\n\nDubai Millennium once again wintered in the Persian Gulf and warmed up for the Dubai World Cup with a four and a half length win over the Prince of Wales's Stakes winner Lear Spear in a round of the Listed Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum Challenge in which he raced on dirt for the first time.\n\nIn the World Cup three weeks later, he led after a furlong and pulled steadily away from the field in the closing stages to win in \"devastating fashion\" beating Behrens by six lengths with the rest of the opposition at least five lengths further back. His performance in winning the world's most valuable horse race in track-record time was acclaimed as an \"awesome display\", and Dettori called the colt \"the best I've ever ridden... absolutely unbelievable\".\n\nOn his return to Europe, Dubai Millennium contested the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, in which he was ridden by Jerry Bailey, Dettori having been injured in a plane crash. In this race, he was finally matched against Sendawar, who by now had won four Group One races and was unbeaten for more than a year. Such was the reputation of the French colt that, for the only time in his career, Dubai Millennium was not the favourite, starting at odds of 5/4 behind Sendawar at 6/5. The challenge did not materialise, however, with Dubai Millennium leading from the start and finishing eight lengths clear of the German challenger Sumitas, with Sendawar, who had attempted to track the winner throughout the race, fading into fourth. When Bailey was asked to compare Dubai Millennium with the American champion Cigar, he described him as \"equally impressive.\"\n\nSheikh Mohammed clearly considered Dubai Millennium the greatest racehorse in the world and sought to race him against Michael Tabor's Arc and King George winner Montjeu, offering to pay Montjeu's entry fee to the Breeders' Cup. Tabor resisted the challenge but told the media he wanted the two horses to be pitted against each other. A media circus erupted, culminating in Sheikh Mohammed proposing a one:one meeting between the two horses and putting down $6 million to back Dubai Millennium to win. Tabor was to match the wager if he took up the challenge. On the morning of Saturday, August 5, as copies of \"Racing Post\" bearing the challenge to Tabor from Sheikh Mohammed were distributed, Dubai Millennium suffered a broken leg (a \"lateral condylar fracture\") in training. His life was saved by an operation, but his racing career was over.\n\nIn the International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings) Dubai Millennium was named the best racehorse in the world in 2000 with a rating of 134, ahead of Sinndar (132) and Montjeu (130). The rating was considered rather disappointing for those who had considered him a true \"great\". He had previously been awarded a rating of 127 for his 1999 performances.\n\nDubai Millennium was given a Timeform rating of 140— the highest since Dancing Brave in 1986, and the eighth highest since the organisation was founded in 1948.\n\nDubai Millennium never won a Cartier Racing Award. In 1999 he was beaten to the titles of Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and Horse of the Year by Montjeu and Daylami respectively. A year later Giant's Causeway was Horse of the Year, with Kalanisi being named Champion Older Horse.\n\nDubai Millennium was retired to the Dalham Hall Stud, part of the Darley Stud organisation. His stallion fee in his first season was set at £100,000.\n\nIn April 2001, the horse became gravely ill with what was quickly diagnosed as grass sickness. Intensive veterinary treatment and three operations were not sufficient to save Dubai Millennium, and he was euthanized whilst still under anaesthetic on 30 April. He was buried at the Dalham Hall Stud.\n\nHis only crop of foals produced several winners including the Prix Daniel Wildenstein winner, Echo of Light and, most notably Dubawi. Dubawi won National Stakes, the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois and went on to sire the 2,000 Guineas winner Makfi and many other important winners.\n\n\n The colt's original name has also been reported as \"Yazzer\", \"Yazaar\" and \"Yareek\".\n"}

{"id": "1877151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877151", "title": "Third (Soft Machine album)", "text": "Third (Soft Machine album)\n\nThird is the third studio album by the rock band Soft Machine, originally released in 1970 as a double LP, with each side of the original vinyl consisting of a single, long composition.\n\n\"Third\" marks the most major of Soft Machine's several shifts in musical genre over their career, completing their transition from psychedelic music to jazz, and is a significant milestone of the Canterbury scene, featuring interplay between the band's personnel: Mike Ratledge on keyboards, Robert Wyatt on drums, Hugh Hopper on bass and newest member Elton Dean on saxophone.\n\nLyn Dobson appears on saxophone and flute on \"Facelift\", recorded while he was a full member of the band (then a quintet), although he is credited as an additional performer. Jimmy Hastings (brother of Pye Hastings from Caravan) makes substantial contributions on flute and clarinet on \"Slightly All the Time\", free-jazz violinist Rab Spall (then a bandmate of Wyatt's in the part-time ensemble Amazing Band) is heard on the coda to \"Moon in June\", and Nick Evans (a member of the band during its short-lived septet incarnation) makes brief appearances on trombone in \"Slightly All the Time\" and \"Out-Bloody-Rageous\".\n\nIn the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition \"Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock\" (2005), the album came #20 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\".\n\nThe original release of \"Third\" had an unpolished sound quality, including tape hiss on the live recordings and abrupt editing. \"Slightly All the Time\" and \"Out-Bloody-Rageous\" are the most straightforward tracks on the album, representing the jazz-rock sound that would be explored further on subsequent albums.\n\n\"Facelift\" is the most radical track. The version on the album was recorded live at the Fairfield Halls, Croydon, 4 January 1970 (the first by the quintet version of the band), with a brief section from the Mothers Club, Birmingham, 11 January 1970, and some recordings from the 1969 \"Spaced\" project. While a large part of the finished product is essentially a live recording, parts involve tape collage and speeding up, slowing down, looping and backwards playing of tapes, the ending being the most memorable part, where two different treatments of the same basic riff (one from the live concert, the other, at double speed, from \"Spaced\") are heard simultaneously, backwards. At the time of the 5-piece line-up, \"Facelift\" was typically expanded with solo improvisations and showcases by Lyn Dobson on flute, vocals and harmonica. \n\n\"Slightly All the Time\" is a medley of different instrumental pieces, including Ratledge's \"Backwards\" and Hopper's \"Noisette\". \"Backwards\" later appeared on fellow Canterbury Scene band Caravan's 1973 album \"For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night\", as part of the \"A-Hunting We Shall Go\" medley.\n\n\"Moon in June\" is the last song with lyrics that Soft Machine recorded, and their last look back to their progressive rock, pre-jazz sound. The song is in three parts. The first is a pastiche of vocal themes delivered in a stream of consciousness which varied in live performances. Wyatt plays all the instruments in this section. The lyrics borrow from Soft Machine's earlier \"That's How Much I Need You Now\" and \"You Don't Remember\", but largely from new vignettes recorded in a demo by Wyatt in October 1968 while on holiday in New York state. An excerpt from a different demo of Part 1, recorded in November 1968, was included on Robert Wyatt's 2001 \"Flotsam Jetsam\" archive compilation. The second part features the whole band, and is an instrumental similar to other jazz-rock pieces on the album. The third is a drone featuring Wyatt and violinist Rab Spall; Spall's part was recorded separately and was sped up and slowed down to make the violin fit the beats of the music. This section also features Wyatt scat singing uncredited renditions of two Kevin Ayers songs: \"Singing a Song in the Morning\" and \"Hat Song\". A demo of the second and third parts was recorded in Spring 1969, which was spliced onto the October 1968 demo to be included on Soft Machine's 2002 \"Backwards\" archival release. A live recording from 24 May 1970 in London was released on \"Backwards\", containing a shortened version of parts 2 and 3. A pre-\"Third\" performance that includes a shortened instrumental Part 1 was recorded live at the Fairfield Halls concert and appears on Soft Machine's 2000 \"Noisette\" archive release.\n\n\"Out-Bloody-Rageous\", the final song on the album, is an instrumental composed by Ratledge, and contains a number of tape loops inspired by the work of Terry Riley. Its name inspired the names of the 2005 Soft Machine biography \"Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous\", and a 2 CD anthology from 2005 entitled \"Out-Bloody-Rageous An Anthology 1967–1973\".\n\nIn 2007 the album was re-issued on CD by Sony BMG with a second disc comprising a complete live album, \"Live at the Proms 1970\", which had been previously released by a small independent company called Reckless Records in 1988. This album was recorded at The BBC Proms in the Royal Albert Hall on 13 August 1970. The band's performance, opening for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, marked the first time that a popular-music band played at the classical festival. The disparity of Soft Machine's concert as compared to the hall's usual fare is explained by Robert Wyatt on the Reckless album's liner notes:\nWe was invited by Tim Souster, who had an evening using the hall to do what he liked with. I believe he'd heard our second LP, asked us on the strength of that. He discovered us on the way to discovering Motown. Via the Who, I think. Anyway it was brave of him to invite us despite the withering contempt of the posh music establishment. Before our bit, I went out the back for a quick fag and then the doorman didn't want to let me back in. \"I've got to play in there\", I said. \"You must be kidding, son\", he said, \"they only have proper music in there\". Not that night they didn't.\n\"Esther's Nose Job\" on the bonus disc originally appeared on \"Volume Two\", and no longer includes its cacophonous introduction, but adds a new section, \"Pigling Bland\", which appeared as a track on its own on the group's \"Fifth\" album a few years later. This version does not contain the lyrics found in the original, but it does include some scat singing from Wyatt. All three pieces on the bonus disc are performed as one continuous suite. (The original vinyl edition had a fade-out and fade-in of the drum solo connecting the second and third pieces, as was necessary for a two-sided LP.)\n\nBoth discs were re-mastered for the re-issue, improving the sound quality significantly.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After playing for Ferencvárosi TC, FC Sète and Hungary he became a coach, most notably with Građanski Zagreb, MTK Hungária FC, Olympiacos F.C. and Hungary. Together with Béla Guttmann and Gusztáv Sebes, he formed a trio of innovative Hungarian coaches who pioneered the 4–2–4 formation.\n\nBukovi began his coaching career with Građanski Zagreb in 1935 and subsequently guided the club to two Yugoslav and two Croatian league titles. After the Second World War, Građanski was banned and replaced with Dinamo Zagreb and Bukovi remained on as manager of the new club. In 1947 Bukovi was appointed manager of MTK Hungária FC. In 1949 when Hungary became a communist state, MTK were taken over by the secret police, the ÁVH, and subsequently the club became known as \"Textiles SE\". They then became \"Bástya SE\", then \"Vörös Lobogó SE\" and then finally back to MTK. Despite this turmoil, the 1950s proved a successful era for the club and with a team that included Péter Palotás, Nándor Hidegkuti, Mihály Lantos and József Zakariás, Bukovi guided them to three Hungarian League titles and a Hungarian Cup.\n\nIn Olympiacos F.C. Bukovi became a legend for the fans, and wrote history in Greek football by gaining 12 consecutive victories. He transformed Olympiacos and produced many young Greek players. Eventually he was forced to leave the club after a string of poor results in the 1967-68 season but mainly because of the military regime, labeled as a communist. He was forced to resign on 12 December 1967 and left Greece along with his assistant coach Mihály Lantos on 21 December 1967.\n\nBukovi also played a major role in the success of the legendary Hungary team known as the \"Mighty Magyars\". It was Bukovi, working at MTK with Péter Palotás and Nándor Hidegkuti, who developed the vital 4-2-4 formation, later adopted by national coach Gusztáv Sebes and exported to Brazil by Béla Guttmann. This formation involved the use of either Palotás or Hidegkuti as a \"deep lying centre-forward\". In 1953 Hidegkuti would exploit this position to great effect as he scored a hat-trick for Hungary when they beat England 6-3 at Wembley Stadium. During the \"Mighty Magyar\" era, Bukovi also worked as an assistant to Sebes and in March 1956, when the latter was sacked as national coach, he succeeded him. On 23 September 1956 he coached a Hungary team that included Gyula Grosics, József Bozsik, Sándor Kocsis, Nándor Hidegkuti, Ferenc Puskás and Zoltán Czibor to a 1–0 victory over the USSR at the \"Lenin Stadium\".

Neither Homer nor Ovid mention a father for Scylla, but Apollodorus says that the father was either Trienus (Triton?) or Phorcus (a variant of Phorkys), similarly the Plato scholiast, perhaps following Apollodorus, gives the father as Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, while Eustathius on Homer, \"Odyssey\" 12.85 gives the father as Triton.\n\nOther authors have Hecate as Scylla's mother. The Hesiodic \"Megalai Ehoiai\" gives Hecate and Phorbas as the parents of Scylla, while Acusilaus says that Scylla's parents were Hecate and Phorkys (so also schol. \"Odyssey\" 12.85). Perhaps trying to reconcile these conflicting accounts, Apollonius of Rhodes says that Crataeis was another name for Hecate, and that she and Phorcys were the parents of Scylla. Likewise, Semos of Delos (\"FGrHist\" 396 F 22) says that Crataeis was the daughter of Hecate and Triton, and mother of Scylla by Deimos.

After attending the minor seminary in Culemborg from 1898 to 1904, de Jong then studied at the Seminary of Rijsenburg for four years. \n\nHe was ordained to the priesthood on August 15, 1908, and further studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Angelicum in Rome, obtaining his doctorates in philosophy and theology.

De Jong ordered his priests to refuse the sacraments to Nazi Dutchmen.\nDuring the Second World War, he was one of the major leaders against the Nazi occupation of Netherlands. On July 26, 1942 Dutch bishops, including Archbishop Johannes de Jong, issued a decree that openly condemned Nazi deportations of Dutch workers and Jews. The Nazis retaliated by seizing 245 Catholics of Jewish descent, including Edith Stein. The Vatican used the Netherlands' experience to explain its silence during the years of the Holocaust. After the German retaliation, Sister Pasqualina Lehnert, Pius XII's housekeeper and confidante, said the Pope was convinced that while the Bishop’s protest cost more than two hundred lives, a protest by him would mean at least two hundred thousand innocent lives that he was not ready to sacrifice. While politicians, generals, and dictators might gamble with the lives of people, a Pope could not.\n\nDe Jong was created Cardinal Priest of \"S. Clemente\" by Pope Pius XII in the consistory of February 18, 1946, but could not travel to Rome for the ceremony as he was recovering from a car accident. However, on October 12 of that year, the Dutch prelate went to Castel Gandolfo to receive his red hat from Pope Pius. In 1951, de Jong, who was the first resident Dutch cardinal since the Protestant Reformation, had to leave the administration of the archdiocese to his coadjutor, Bernardus Johannes Alfrink. Meanwhile, de Jong retired to the same house where he had lived during his early priestly ministry in Amersfoort.\n\nDe Jong died in his sleep after a long illness in Amersfoort, two days before his 70th birthday. He is buried at St. Barbara cemetery in the court of St. Catherine's Cathedral.\n\n"}

He became Chief of Engineers of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, was the first superintendent of United States Military Academy, and was elected to the Fourteenth United States Congress.\nWilliams was born in Boston, Massachusetts and attended Harvard University. Williams, a grandnephew of Benjamin Franklin, in 1779 married Marianne Alexander, a Scottish girl, daughter of William Alexander a friend of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHe spent most of the period from 1770 to 1785 in England and France. In January 1777, aged 20, at the suggestion of Silas Deane, Jonathan Williams went to Nantes to keep a close eye on Thomas Morris, who had just taken up the post of commercial agent. Williams was also requit red to inspect shipments of ammunition, uniforms and men, which led him to rent premises and hire staff. He had also \"to gather information on all subjects that affect American interests.\" Many people wanted to do business with the Americans; Williams decided to rely mainly on Jean Peltier Dudoyer, a local shipowner. \nA dispute soon arose. Since France was not officially at war, the Americans asked Peltier Dudoyer to build a ship which, when offshore, would become a corsair. It was the \"Lion\" later named \"Deane\". But the atmosphere was detestable, all French landed quickly, including Nicolas Baudin. J. Williams served as arbiter and signed a certificate discharging Peltier Dudoyer. \nWhen Morris died, William Lee was sent to France. He had to review and close the accounts and consider Morris’ replacement. Pending a decision of the Congress, J. Williams remained in office. This was the beginning of various problems: there are 4 brothers Lee and a nephew Thomas ... Moreover, Deane departed for the United States and was replaced by John Adams, who did not speak French and began to question Williams’ achievements. \nThe resale of the Drake, seized by John Paul Jones, caused difficulties: J. Williams sold the ship to Schweighauser, a shipowner from Nantes, while American Captain NcNeil wanted to buy it. Finally, after an agreement, the \"Drake\" was resold to Peltier Dudoyer \"on behalf of Mr. de Monthieu\" on November 20, 1778. \nThe dispute between J. Williams and the Lee family, was settled by a duel in Lorient, June 18, 1779. On that day, Williams, allegedly drunk, insulted Thomas Lee. They met in a room, fired at each other and both fortunately missed. \nBack in the United States, he joined the American Philosophical Society in 1788 and published articles on scientific subjects.\n\nPresident John Adams appointed Williams a major in the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers in February 1801. President Thomas Jefferson upon approval made him the Army's Inspector of Fortifications and assigned him to serve as the first superintendent of West Point in December 1801. The following year Jefferson also appointed him to concurrently command the separate Corps of Engineers established by the Military Peace Establishment Act and Congress and signed by Jefferson on March 16, 1802. He vacated (not resigned) his Superintendent position in 1803 but was reappointed in 1805.\n\nIn 1802, the investor Richard Woodhull purchased in north Brooklyn and named the area Williamsburgh (later changed to Williamsburg), after Williams, who surveyed the land.\n\nFrom 1807 to 1811 Williams designed and completed construction of Castle Williams (the East Battery) and Castle Clinton (the West Battery) in New York Harbor. Castle Williams was the first casemated battery in the United States. He founded the U.S. Military Philosophical Society and gave it its motto, \"Science in War is the Guarantee of Peace.\"\n\nHe resigned from the Army in July 1812 because the Secretary of War, William Eustis, refused to give him command of Castle Williams, a fortification that he designed and was named after him. At that time, New York State placed him in charge of construction of fortifications for New York City. He eventually returned to Philadelphia and headed a group of volunteer engineers building fortifications around the city when he was elected to the Fourteenth United States Congress from that city in 1814. He died of gout in Philadelphia before the Congress assembled.\n\nHe was originally buried in Pine Street Cemetery between 4th and 5th Streets in Philadelphia and was re-interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery not far from his home, Mount Pleasant in Fairmount Park, in 1862.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1877214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877214", "title": "John Obi Mikel", "text": "John Obi Mikel\n\nJohn Obi Mikel (born 22 April 1987) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder.\n\nMikel began his career with local club Plateau United, before joining Norwegian club Lyn at the age of 17 in 2004. In 2006, he made a controversial transfer to English club Chelsea after Manchester United claimed they had already signed him. He stayed with Chelsea for 11 years, before moving to China with Tianjin TEDA in 2017. After two years in China, he returned to England on a short-term deal with Middlesbrough, before joining Trabzonspor on a free transfer in July 2019. In a 14-year international career between 2005 and 2019, he played 88 times for Nigeria, scoring six goals.\n\nMikel was born in Jos, Plateau State, the son of Michael Obi, who runs an inter-state transport company in Jos. His father was a member of the Igbo ethnic group.\n\nMikel started his football career at the age of 12 when picked as a talented footballer from over 3,000 young talents to play in Pepsi Football Academy, a team that at the time was well known for travelling across Nigeria scouting young footballers with the potential to play professionally. Obi stood out to scouts and was later picked to play for top-flight club Plateau United, a side that had previously developed stars Celestine Babayaro, Victor Obinna and Chris Obodo, among others, that went on to success in European leagues. Later known as John Obi Mikel, he made headlines for his country at the FIFA Under-17 World Championships held in Finland. Following the tournament, he went on to a trial at South Africa club Ajax Cape Town, ultimately joining Oslo-based club Lyn Fotball in Norway.\n\nDuring preparations for the 2003 FIFA Under-17 World Championships, the Nigerian Football Association (NFA) mistakenly submitted \"Michael\" as \"Mikel\" for the tournament in Finland. He decided to keep the new name, saying that it had a \"special ring to it.\" On 31 July 2006, he stated that he prefers to be called Mikel John Obi instead of John Obi Mikel, as he had most commonly been called.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Mikel played for Nigeria at the FIFA World Youth Championships held in the Netherlands. He had an excellent tournament until Nigeria reached the final, where they lost 2–1 to Argentina. Obi won the Silver Ball after being voted the tournament's second-best player.\n\nOn 29 April 2005, a few days after Mikel turned 18, Premier League club Manchester United announced that it had struck a deal with Lyn to sign the player. United's website also claimed that they had done a deal directly with the teenager and that he had signed a contract to join them. Mikel's agents were bypassed as the club persuaded the youngster to sign a four-year contract without representation. Lyn allegedly sent a fax to his agents abroad, claiming their services were no longer required by Mikel. Reports said the deal was initially worth £4 million, and would see the player arrive at Old Trafford in January 2006.\n\nManchester United's rival Premier League club, Chelsea, later issued a counter-claim suggesting that they already had an agreement with Mikel and his agents, but Lyn denied this claim. However, subsequent reports indicated that Chelsea claimed to have been involved in arranging the player's original move to Europe with a view to signing him at a later date. Further substance was added to this claim after it was revealed that the player had impressed Chelsea manager José Mourinho while training with the club's first-team squad during the summer of 2004.\n\nMikel expressed his delight at joining United in a hastily arranged press conference, where he was pictured holding up a Manchester United shirt bearing the squad number 21. Following his signing of the contract to join United, there were claims from Norway that he had received a number of threatening phone calls from unknown sources. Mikel was assigned a security guard and moved to a safe hotel. On 11 May 2005, however, the midfielder went missing during a Norwegian Cup game against Klemetsrud; he had not been selected for the match but had been watching from the stands. Whilst the player was believed to have left with one of his agents, John Shittu, who had by now flown in to meet Mikel, his disappearance sparked massive media coverage in Norway and also provoked a police enquiry after Lyn Director Morgan Andersen made claims in the Norwegian media that Mikel had been \"kidnapped\". These claims were later repeated by Manchester United's assistant manager Carlos Queiroz, who accused Chelsea of being involved in the alleged \"kidnapping\".\n\nIt subsequently emerged that Mikel had travelled to London with his agent John Shittu, who was working for Jerome Anderson's SEM group. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson considered travelling to Oslo to visit Mikel, but decided against this after Mikel was reported to have left the country. Staying in a London hotel and some nine days after disappearing, Mikel stated on Sky Sports News that he had been pressured into signing the contract with United without his agent present, claims furiously rebuffed by both Manchester United and Lyn. Mikel told the British media that Chelsea were the club he genuinely wanted to sign for. In response to these events, United made an official complaint to FIFA about the behaviour of both Chelsea and the player's agents, Shittu and Rune Hauge, already infamous for his role in the George Graham bungs scandal. FIFA dismissed these claims in August 2005, stating there was insufficient evidence to bring a case against Chelsea.\n\nFollowing the tournament, Mikel failed to return to Lyn, whereupon the club subsequently lodged a complaint with FIFA. On 12 August 2005, FIFA ruled that Mikel should return to Lyn to fulfill the remainder of his contract with the club, whilst they would decide at a later date whether the contract he signed with United should be upheld or cancelled. After a delay of over a month, Mikel complied with the FIFA decision and returned to Lyn in early September 2005 after a three-month absence.\n\nRather than leaving FIFA to determine the validity of the contract signed with Manchester United, Chelsea intervened by volunteering to settle the transfer saga through negotiation with Lyn and Manchester United.\n\nOn 2 June 2006, Chelsea, Manchester United and Lyn reached a settlement to resolve the future of the player. Mikel's registration was to be transferred from Lyn to Chelsea; Manchester United agreed to terminate their option agreement with Mikel. Under the terms of this agreement, Chelsea agreed to pay United £12 million, half paid upon the finalization of the contract and the other half in June 2007, and Lyn £4 million, half payable immediately and half in June 2007. As a result of this settlement, all claims in this matter were withdrawn. On 19 July 2006, Chelsea were granted a work permit for the midfielder after they completed the £16 million signing in June 2006.\n\nIn the aftermath of the transfer, Lyn Director Morgan Andersen, who had a previous conviction for forging official documents, was convicted of fraud and making false accusations; he was given a one-year suspended jail sentence by an Oslo court. The court also ordered him to pay 20,000 kroner (£1,944) in costs. Chelsea made a High Court claim for £16 million against Lyn and Andersen following the conviction, claiming that the previously agreed settlement was not binding as \"the transfer was based on a fraudulent misrepresentation, now proven by a court of law.\" This claim was subsequently resolved out of court.\n\nOn 12 September 2006, Mikel made his first start for Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League against Bulgarian club Levski Sofia and took a powerful shot which the goalkeeper failed to save and Didier Drogba pounced on the rebound. Mikel received many positive comments for his performance in the match. However, since being sent off in a match against Reading on 14 October 2006, Mikel was fined on three separate occasions by Chelsea for turning up late to training.\n\nAt the time, Chelsea manager José Mourinho was believed to have strong reservations about his lifestyle outside of Stamford Bridge, and the club were reportedly considering offloading the player. Mikel was dropped for over a month, during which his father Michael voiced his concerns over his son's behaviour. After improved punctuality and showings at training sessions, Mikel earned a recall for Chelsea's Champions League group stage away game against Werder Bremen on 23 November 2006. He scored his first goal for Chelsea in their 6–1 FA Cup victory over Macclesfield Town on 6 January 2007. He also scored against Nottingham Forest in the following round of the competition. During Chelsea's triumph in the League Cup final in 2007, Mikel was sent off in injury time (having come on as a substitute) after clashing with Kolo Touré. The incident was followed by a huge fracas, in which Touré and Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal were sent off, Cesc Fàbregas and Frank Lampard were booked and Mourinho and Arsène Wenger were involved in an altercation on the pitch.\n\nIn subsequent games, Mourinho deployed Mikel as a starter in a holding role in key games where he impressed greatly, notably in the Chelsea–Tottenham Hotspur FA Cup sixth round replay, the Champions League quarter-final games against Valencia, the Champions League semi-final games against Liverpool and also the victorious 2007 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. Mikel's height and great strength, allied to good ball control and an unusually wide range of passing, allows him not only to disrupt opposing attacks, but also to spread the play effectively. Mikel supplanted the French midfielder Claude Makélélé in the lineup following his departure to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nMikel was sent-off for the third time in his career in September 2007, when referee Mike Dean dismissed him for a tackle on Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. Chelsea appealed against the red card, but the three-match suspension was upheld.\n\nMikel was also sent off in the semi-final of the League Cup against Everton for a challenge on Phil Neville. Despite this, he came back strongly to round off what has been a good first two seasons for him at Chelsea.\n\nThe summer of 2008 saw veteran defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé transferred to French club Paris Saint-Germain, leaving the defensive midfield position vacant. Throughout the 2008–09 season, Mikel saw a great deal of playing time due to an injury to Michael Essien. During this period of increased action, Mikel performed admirably in the role. His ever-improving game was praised by Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, and his importance to the team was underlined when he provided the free kick that Salomon Kalou scored to equalise against Manchester United. He played so well in 2008–09 that he was nominated for the club player and young player of the season. On 24 January 2009, Mikel was charged with drunk driving, just hours before an FA Cup game against Ipswich Town – Mikel was not due to play in the game as he was serving a suspension. Although he had all that trouble on 22 July, Mikel signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea.\n\nOn 13 February 2010, Mikel provided a long ball for Didier Drogba to latch onto and fire past goalkeeper David Marshall as Chelsea beat Cardiff City 4–1 in the FA Cup fifth round. Mikel provided another assist for a Drogba goal in a 5–0 win over FA Cup finalists and relegated side Portsmouth on 24 March, as Chelsea cut United's lead at the top of the table to one point. Mikel played the full ninety minutes in Chelsea's 7–1 smashing of Aston Villa three days later as Chelsea kept pace in the title race with Manchester United. In their next Premier League game against United, Mikel played excellent as a marshall in midfield as Chelsea climbed above United in the table with a 2–1 win at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Joe Cole and Drogba.\n\nUnder new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Mikel continued to perform with efficiency in his defensive midfield role, notching 35 appearances for the Blues. In May 2010, he received Premier League and FA Cup winner's medals as part of Chelsea's first ever league-cup double winning team.\n\nMikel and Chelsea started the new 2010–11 Premier League campaign where they left off from the 2009–10 season, playing strong defense and adding deadly finishing. Mikel played the full 90 and helped keep three clean-sheets in the first three games as Chelsea eased past West Bromwich Albion 6–0 on 14 August, crushed Wigan Athletic 6–0 at the DW Stadium seven days later and edged past Stoke City 2–0 on 28 August.\n\nMikel was the preferred option in defensive midfield as teammate Michael Essien spent most of the season on the sideline with knee injuries. The injury to the versatile Essien forced the club to play new signing Ramires more often in the second half of the season. Mikel featured in 28 Premier League campaigns for Chelsea as the London side finished in second place, nine points behind champions Manchester United. Following the disappointment of not winning a title, Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti was sacked by the club.\n\nBefore the start of their league campaign, Mikel's father was abducted in his native Nigeria on 10 August; despite this, Mikel started in the club's opening fixture against Stoke City at Britannia Stadium. Mikel came close to claiming his first Premier League goal for Chelsea in an inspired game as the sides played out a 0–0 draw in new coach André Villas-Boas' first game in charge.\n\nDue to Essien's long-term knee injury, Mikel found more playing time, but around Christmas time lost his place to new signing Oriol Romeu. Following a run of disappointing fixtures, including a catastrophic 3–1 loss to Napoli in the Champions League round of 16 first leg and a 1–0 defeat to West Brom, Villas-Boas was sacked by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. In both of these matches, Mikel was an unused substitute for the Blues. Following the appointment of former Chelsea midfielder Roberto Di Matteo as interim head coach, Mikel appeared in 16 of the club's last 20 games and started in 14 of them, and began to play some of his best football for the club.\n\nMikel played the full 90 minutes in Chelsea's 2–1 victory over Liverpool in the 2012 FA Cup Final on 5 May 2012, picking up a yellow card in the 36th minute. The 2011–12 Premier League campaign saw Mikel appear in 22 league fixtures, starting 15 of them, as well as playing in eight fixtures leading up to the team's appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich.\n\nIn the final in Munich on 19 May, Mikel played the full 120 minutes as the sides played out a 1–1 draw. Chelsea played a tough defensive battle and Mikel was hailed by Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp as playing an excellent game, putting in \"a performance that I didn't think he had in him; he was putting out fires everywhere,\" as Chelsea claimed a 4–3 victory in the penalty shootout. Following his performance, Mikel told reporters that it was \"best night of our lives.\" Mikel's strong performances in the final stages of the season and his impressive display in Munich helped Chelsea secure Champions League football next season despite finishing in sixth place, knocking London rivals Tottenham into the UEFA Europa League.\n\nMikel started all of Chelsea's first five games of the new 2012–13 Premier League season, and also played in the Community Shield against Manchester City and Super Cup against Atlético Madrid. In November, Mikel was named on the shortlist for the African Footballer of the Year along with former Chelsea teammate Didier Drogba.\n\nMikel was charged with misconduct by the Football Association (FA) on 22 November 2012. He was given a three-match ban and fined £60,000 for threatening referee Mark Clattenburg during a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United.\n\nOn 5 December 2012, Mikel signed a contract extension with Chelsea, keeping him at the club until 2017.\n\nOn 21 September 2013, Mikel scored his first-ever Premier League goal in a 2–0 win against Fulham. He scored his second goal of the season in Chelsea's third round tie with Derby County on 5 January 2014, heading in the opening goal in an eventual 2–0 victory. He made his 200th Premier League appearance for Chelsea on 3 February, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 away victory at Manchester City.\n\nOn 30 August 2014, Mikel, who substituted Willian on the 75-minute mark, set up Diego Costa's second goal after intercepting up Muhamed Bešić's backheel pass. Chelsea went on to win 6–3 against Everton at Goodison Park. Mikel scored a rare goal against Sporting CP on 10 December in a 3–1 victory at Stamford Bridge in the 2014–15 Champions League.\n\nAgainst Watford on Boxing Day 2015, in the first game of Guus Hiddink's second spell in charge, Mikel came on to become the 21st player to make 350 appearances for Chelsea. Chelsea then faced Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16. Mikel conceded a foul just outside the 18-yard box. PSG forward Zlatan Ibrahimović's free kick deflected off Mikel, who was part of the wall, and past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Just a few minutes later, however, Mikel equalised from a stoppage time corner kick. Due to the injuries of John Terry and Gary Cahill, Mikel had to play as a centre-back in multiple games.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, it was announced that the club would not be renewing his contract when it expired at the end of the season.\n\nOn 6 January 2017, Chinese club Tianjin TEDA signed Mikel on a free transfer. On 14 April 2018, he scored his second league goal for Tianjin, and first goal of the season against Guangzhou R&F. He left Tianjin TEDA at the end of the 2018 Chinese Super League season in November 2018.\n\nAfter two years in China, Mikel joined English Championship team Middlesbrough on a short-term deal in the 2019 winter transfer window. The 31-year-old was a free agent after leaving Chinese side Tianjin TEDA. He was released by Middlesbrough at the end of the 2018–19 season.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Mikel joined Trabzonspor on a two-year contract with the option of a further year.\n\nIt was announced on 17 March 2020, that Mikel had left Trabzonspor by mutual consent, days after expressing his concerns about the Turkish Super Lig continuing amid the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMikel represented the Nigeria under-20 team at the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and won the Silver Ball for the second-best player at the tournament (behind Lionel Messi) as the Africans finished runner-up to Argentina.\n\nHe made his debut for the Nigeria senior team on 17 August 2005, when he came on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 friendly win over Libya. He did not play for the national team again prior to being named in the squad for the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. In Nigeria's first group game, against Ghana, Mikel was an unused substitute. However, he was introduced into the second game against Zimbabwe early in the second half. Within ten minutes of coming on, he had supplied both the corner that resulted in Christian Obodo heading the game's opening goal, and scored Nigeria's second goal. He made his first international start in Nigeria's final group game, a 2–1 victory over Senegal.\n\nIn 2007, Mikel was suspended from all Nigerian national teams after manager Berti Vogts dropped Mikel from the team's squad for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Niger for failing to attend their previous match against Uganda. Mikel cited an injury, but because he did not attend an independent check by Nigerian officials, he was dropped. This, and his refusal to play for the Nigerian under-23 side, resulted in his suspension by the Nigeria Football Federation. After apologising, he was called up to the national squad for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana. At the tournament, he scored one goal and registered one assist in a match against Benin to help Nigeria qualify for the quarter-finals against hosts Ghana, where they lost 2–1 to their West African rivals.\n\nMikel had been called up for the under-23 side in preparation of the team's last Olympic qualifier on 26 March 2008, needing a win to qualify. His failure to show up for any of the qualifiers again setting off some controversy with the U23 team coach Samson Siasia, who dropped him from the Olympic squad amidst significant furor from the media.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Mikel was ruled out of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa due to injury. He had been struggling to recover from a knee problem after undergoing surgery in May, though there were also reports that an ankle injury was to blame for Mikel's withdrawal.\n\nAt the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Mikel was a key player for Nigeria as they went on to win their third continental title. He was named by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in the team of the tournament alongside teammates Vincent Enyeama, Efe Ambrose, Victor Moses and Emmanuel Emenike.\n\nMikel made his FIFA World Cup debut during the 2014 tournament in Brazil, earning a man of the match award in the Super Eagles' opening game against Iran and helping the team to reach the knockout stage for the first time since 1998.\n\nHe was selected by Nigeria for their 35-man provisional squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics and was later named captain of the Olympics squad. On 13 August 2016, Mikel scored his first ever Olympic goal in a 2–0 win against Denmark to advance to the semi-final. After the 2–0 defeat to Germany, Nigeria went on to the bronze medal match against Honduras. On 20 August, Mikel helped Nigeria to the bronze medal in a 3–2 victory over Honduras. Nigeria became the first ever country to win all three medals at the Olympic Games with the 1996 squad winning the gold and 2008 squad winning the silver.\n\nIn a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Algeria, Mikel scored a goal and assisted his Chelsea teammate Victor Moses in a 3–1 victory.\n\nIn July 2019, he said that the 2019 African Cup of Nations would be his last tournament for Nigeria. He retired at the end of the competition, in which Nigeria came third.\n\nOn 12 August 2011, Mikel's father, Michael Obi, was the victim of a suspected kidnapping in Nigeria. Mikel was informed before Chelsea's match against Stoke City two days later but opted to play despite his concerns for his father's well-being. On 15 August 2011, Mikel made an impassioned plea for his father's safe return. He told Sky Sports News, \"I've always tried to help the country, this is the time for the country to help me, whoever knows where my dad is should please contact me.\" Michael Obi was found alive on 22 August 2011, in the Nigerian city of Kano. His abductors were reported to be in police custody. On 26 June 2018, a few hours before a FIFA World Cup match, Mikel was informed of another kidnapping of Michael Obi, but did not tell any of his team members. The Enugu State Police stated that they rescued Michael Obi on 2 July after a gunfight.\n\nChelsea\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria Olympic\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

In a career that lasted from September 2001 to October 2003, he ran 13 times and won 10 races. His win in the Racing Post Trophy made him one of the highest-rated two-year-olds of 2001. In 2002, he defeated Hawk Wing in The Derby and won the Breeders' Cup Turf. At four, he defeated Falbrav and Alamshar in the Irish Champion Stakes and won a second Breeders' Cup Turf.\n\nHigh Chaparral was a dark-coated bay horse with a white star. He stood just over 16 hands high and was bred in County Tipperary, Ireland, by Sean Coughlan. In September 2000, he was consigned by the Mountain View Stud to the Tattersalls sales, where he was bought for 270,000 guineas by Dermot \"Demi\" O'Byrne on behalf of Michael Tabor's Coolmore organisation. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle.\n\nHigh Chaparral failed to make a winning debut, beaten by a short-head by Hot Trotter in a maiden at Punchestown on 30 September. A week later, he recorded his first victory when winning a maiden race at Tipperary by two and a half lengths. On his next start, High Chaparral was sent to England to run in the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster. He was considered the Ballydoyle second string, behind the odds-on favourite Castle Gandolfo. Ridden by the British veteran Kevin Darley, High Chaparral was held up in the early stages before producing a sustained run in the closing stages to beat his stable companion by three-quarters of a length.\n\nOn his three-year-old debut, High Chaparral recorded a seven-length win in the Ballysax Stakes at Leopardstown on 14 April. A month later, he started at odds of 1/5 in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and won by a length from In Time's Eye.\n\nAfter winning both trials, High Chaparral was strongly fancied for the 2002 Epsom Derby and was made 7/2 second favourite. The strong favourite was his stable companion Hawk Wing, second in the 2,000 Guineas. Hawk Wing was selected by Mick Kinane, leaving the ride on High Chaparral to Johnny Murtagh. Among the other contenders was Bandari, who had won the Lingfield Derby Trial by over ten lengths. Murtagh held the colt up in the early stages, before moving up to take the lead early in the straight. He was soon challenged by Hawk Wing and from that point on the stablemates had the race between them. High Chaparral was never headed and won by two lengths. The O'Brien pair finished 12 lengths clear of Moon Ballad in third.\n\nThree weeks after his win at Epsom, High Chaparral reappeared in the Irish Derby at the Curragh, for which he started as the 1/3 favourite. Ridden by Mick Kinane, he took the lead in the closing stages and won from his stable companion Sholokhov, who had been his pacemaker.\n\nHigh Chaparral was then off the racecourse for more than three months before running in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. He was ridden by Mick Kinane and started 2.2/1 favourite against 15 opponents. He was always prominent and ran on strongly in the straight, but never reached the front and finished third behind Marienbard and Sulamani, beaten just over a length. Three weeks later, High Chaparral was sent to Arlington Park for the Breeders' Cup Turf. He was held up in the early stages before producing what \"The Guardian\"'s correspondent described as an \"irresistible surge\" to take the lead in the final furlong and win by one and a quarter lengths from With Anticipation. After the race, Kinane described him as \"all class\".\n\nContrary to the trend of retiring three-year-old champions, High Chaparral was kept in training at four, although he did not race until August. He then won the Royal Whip Stakes at the Curragh, beating Imperial Dancer by three-quarters of a length. Four weeks later, he won a rough race for the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown, beating Falbrav by a neck with Islington third and the King George winner Alamshar fourth.\n\nIn October, High Chaparral again started favourite for the Arc, this time going off at odds of 13/8 in a field of 13. He finished third, beaten more than five lengths by Dalakhani. On his final start, he returned to the United States to attempt to become the first horse to win two runnings of the Breeders' Cup Turf. High Chaparral raced in fourth place before making his challenge in the straight. He appeared to have narrowly got the better of a sustained battle with Falbrav, but was then caught in the last stride by Johar. The result of the three-way photo-finish was a dead heat for first place between High Chaparral and Johar, with Falbrav a head back in third.\n\nHigh Chaparral was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Male Turf Horse in both 2002 and 2003. In 2001, he was rated the seventh-best two-year-old in Europe, nine pounds below the champion Johannesburg. A year later, he was rated the second-best racehorse in the world, two pounds behind Rock of Gibraltar. In 2003, High Chaparral was rated the equal-fourth-best horse in the world by the International Federation of Horse Racing Authorities.\n\nDuring the 2005 Northern Hemisphere winter, High Chaparral was a shuttle stallion at Windsor Park Stud in New Zealand. In 2006, he stood at Coolmore Stud, Fethard, South Tipperary, for a service fee of €25,000.\n\nHis first New Zealand crop includes 2009 and 2010 Cox Plate winner So You Think, 2009 Victoria Derby and Spring Champion Stakes winner Monaco Consul, 2010 Randwick Guineas, the Australian Derby winner Shoot Out, and 2010 Caulfield Cup winner Descarado.\n\nDuring the 2010 Australian stud season, High Chaparral stood for A$88,000 at Coolmore Stud near Jerrys Plains, New South Wales, in Australia after Coolmore retained Montjeu in Ireland.\n\nHigh Chaparral died on 21 December 2014, with Coolmore announcing: \"High Chaparral has been euthanised at Fethard Equine Hospital during exploratory colic surgery due to a perforated intestine\".\n\n\"c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding\"\n\n\n"}

Announced by the NLL on May 11, 2005, the LumberJax played their home games at the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon. It was announced on May 4, 2009 that the team would be leaving Portland after four seasons of play and on July 7, 2009 the NLL held a dispersal draft for the Lumberjax players.\n\nThe expansion LumberJax got off to a slow start in their first year, but later turned their season around and made it to the playoffs with an 11-5 record. The LumberJax finished first in their division, becoming the only expansion team to win their division in the 20-year history of the NLL. The LumberJax season ended with a loss in the opening round of the playoffs to the Arizona Sting.\n\nThe LumberJax were less successful in their sophomore season, finishing last in the West Division with a 4-12 record.\n\nIn their third year, the LumberJax finished with a sub-500 record for the second straight year (6-10), but were able to enter the playoffs as the fourth-seed in the West.\n\nThe LumberJax won their first playoff game in franchise history on May 4, 2008, an 18-16 victory over the San Jose Stealth at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, California.

Prior to his show business career, he had served in the British army with Gurkha and special forces units.\n\nWilliam Inglis Linden-Travers was born in Sunderland, England, the son of Florence (née Wheatley) and William Halton Lindon-Travers, a theatre manager. His sister Linden (1913–2001), and her daughter Susan, became actresses.\n\nLinden-Travers enlisted as a private in the British Army at the age of 18, a few months after the outbreak of the Second World War, and was sent to India. Travers was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the Indian Army on 9 July 1942 (from the rank of private). He served in the Long Range Penetration Brigade 4th Battalion 9th Gorkha Rifles in Burma, attached to Orde Wingate's staff, during which service he came to know John Masters, who was his brigade major (Travers was later to act in \"Bhowani Junction\", a tale written by Masters). While deep behind enemy lines, Major Travers was struck by malaria and volunteered to be left behind in a native Burmese village. To avoid capture, he disguised himself as a Chinese national and walked hundreds of miles through jungle territory until he reached an Allied position.\n\nIn 1945, Travers was promoted to the rank of major, and he joined Force 136 Special Operations Executive and was parachuted into Malaya. Travers was responsible for training and tactical decisions with the main resistance movement, the communist-led Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA).\n\nTravers was one of the first allied operatives to enter the Japanese city of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb. He wrote about his experience in his diary, registering profound horror at the destruction and loss of life.\nMajor Travers left the armed forces in 1947.\n\nOn 7 November 1946 Travers was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) \"in recognition of gallant and distinguished service whilst engaged in Special Operations in South East Asia\".\n\nTravers got out of the army in 1947 and decided to become an actor. He began working on stage in 1949 appearing in John Van Druten's \"The Damask Cheek\", then a year later made his film debut in \"Conspirator\" (1949). He had unbilled parts in \"Trio\" (1950), and \"The Wooden Horse\" (1950). Travers had a slightly bigger part in \"The Browning Version\" (1951) and a good role on TV in \"Albert\" (later filmed as \"Albert R.N.\") for \"BBC Sunday-Night Theatre\" (1951).\n\nTravers could be seen in \"Hindle Wakes\" (1952), \"The Planter's Wife\" (1952), \"The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men\" (1952), \"It Started in Paradise\" (1952), \"Mantrap\" (1953), \"Street of Shadows\" (1953), and \"The Square Ring\" (1953). He was in \"The Heel\" for \"Douglas Fairbanks Presents\".\n\nTravers remained a supporting player in \"Counterspy\" (1953) and had a good part in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1954) as Benvolio. His best chance to date was in \"Footsteps in the Fog\" (1955), starring Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons.\n\nTravers breakthrough came when he was cast in the title role of \"Geordie\" (1955), directed by Frank Launder. This was popular in Britain and the US and saw him contracted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which thought he was going to be a big star and brought him to Hollywood. \n\nMGM cast him in the expensive epic \"Bhowani Junction\" (1956), with Granger and Ava Gardner. He followed this as the romantic lead in a remake of \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (1957), opposite Jennifer Jones. Powell and Pressburger wanted him to star in the lead of \"Ill Met By Moonlight\" but the role went to Dirk Bogarde. Travers briefly returned to Britain to make a comedy, \"The Smallest Show on Earth\" (1957), with his second wife Virginia McKenna, who he had married in 1957.\n\nBack in Hollywood, he was Eleanor Parker's character's love interest in \"The Seventh Sin\" (1957), a remake of a Greta Garbo film. MGM tested him for the lead in \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) and he wrote a swashbuckler to star himself, \"The Falcon\". However his MGM films all performed disappointingly at the box office - \"Barretts\" and \"Seventh Sign\" were notable flops - and enthusiasm for Travers in Hollywood cooled.\n\nTravers did \"A Cook for Mr. General\" for \"Kraft Theatre\" (1958) on TV. Then he returned to Britain.\n\nTravers and McKenna starred in a melodrama for the Rank Organisation, \"Passionate Summer\" (1958). He tried to get up a war film set in Greenland, \"The Sledge Patrol\", but it does not appear to have been made. He and Launder tried to repeat the success of \"Geordie\" with \"The Bridal Path\" (1960), but the film was not a success.\n\nTravers did \"Born a Giant\" for \"Our American Heritage\" (1960) on TV, then returned to Britain where he made a British monster film, \"Gorgo\" (1961). Travers and McKenna reteamed on a thriller, \"Two Living, One Dead\" (1961). He then starred in a race car drama for MGM, \"The Green Helmet\" (1961), and a comedy with Spike Milligan, \"Invasion Quartet\" (1961).\n\nHe was in a Broadway production of \"A Cook for Mr General\" (1961).\nTravers starred in a TV adaptation of \"Lorna Doone\" (1963). He returned to Hollywood to do some episodes of \"The Everglades\", \"Rawhide\" (\"Incident at Two Graves\") and \"Espionage\" (\"A Camel to Ride\"). Back on Broadway he played the title role in \"Abraham Cochrane\" which had a short run.\n\nTravers' most famous film role came when he played game warden George Adamson in the highly successful 1966 film \"Born Free\", about which experience the two co-wrote the book \"On Playing with Lions\". He co-starred with McKenna and the experience made him and his wife very conscious of the many abuses of wild animals in captivity that had been taken from Africa and other natural environments around the world. \n\nTravers received an offer to play a support role in \"Duel at Diablo\" (1967); during filming he broke a leg and dislocated a shoulder. He played the title role in a British TV version of \"The Admirable Crichton\" (1968), alongside his wife, and had a small part in Peter Hall's adaptation of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1968).\n\nTravers teamed up with James Hill, the director of \"Born Free\", to make the documentary, \"The Lions Are Free\" (1969), which both men directed.\n\nTravers and McKenna made another \"animal movie\", \"Ring of Bright Water\" (1969) for which he also wrote the script. They followed this with \"An Elephant Called Slowly\" (1970), which Travers helped write and produce with James Hill, who directed. In 1969, he played Captain Hook on a stage production of \"Peter Pan\".\n\nTravers worked as an actor only on \"Rum Runners\" (1971) with Brigitte Bardot and Lino Ventura. He directed and appeared in a documentary, \"The Lion at World's End\" (1971) about Christian the lion.\n\nHe was reunited with James Hill on \"The Belstone Fox\" (1973) and co-wrote a documentary, \"The Wild Dogs of Africa\" for \"The World About Us\" (1973). He later produced \"The Baboons of Gombe\" (1975) for the same show.\n\nHe and Hill wrote and produced \"The Queen's Garden\" (1977) together, and Travers helped produce \"Bloody Ivory\" (1980).\n\nTravers appeared in \"Tramps and Poachers\", an episode of \"To the Manor Born\" (1980). In \"\" (1984) he and McKenna played the parents of Edwin Flack.\n\nThe importance of animal rights led to Travers and his wife becoming involved in the \"Zoo Check Campaign\" in 1984 that evolved to their establishing the Born Free Foundation in 1991. \n\nOne of his last credits was \"Highland Fling\" on \"Lovejoy\" (1992).\n\nBill Travers spent his last three years travelling around Europe's slum zoos and a TV documentary that he made exposed the appalling suffering of thousands of animals. Travers died in his sleep in Dorking, Surrey, aged 72. He was survived by his wife and five children. His widow, Virginia McKenna, carries on his work to help suffering animals, as does their son, Will Travers, who is President of the Born Free Foundation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877254", "title": "Alf Clausen", "text": "Alf Clausen\n\nAlf Heiberg Clausen (born March 28, 1941) is an American film and television composer. He is best known for his work scoring many episodes of \"The Simpsons\", of which he had been the sole composer between 1990 and 2017. Clausen has scored or orchestrated music for more than 30 films and television shows, including \"Moonlighting\", \"The Naked Gun\", \"ALF\" and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". Clausen received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the prestigious Berklee College of Music in 1996.\n\nClausen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. Clausen was interested in music from a young age. He counts composer Henry Mancini as one of his heroes; his book \"Sounds and Scores\" inspired him. He sang in his high school choir and began playing the French horn in the seventh grade (Grade 7) and also learned piano. He continued playing and learned to play the bass guitar, stopping singing because the choir met at the same time as the band. He studied mechanical engineering at North Dakota State University although, after being inspired by his pianist cousin, switched his major to musical theory. Whilst there, Clausen took a correspondence course at Boston's Berklee College of Music in jazz and big band writing. He went on to attend the University of Wisconsin–Madison to complete his master's degree, but quit as he disliked the place, especially what he felt was an \"anti-jazz\" attitude. He then worked for a period as a musician. He later attended Berklee and graduated with a diploma in arranging and composition in 1966. Clausen was the first French horn player to ever attend the college and took part in many ensembles; he is also featured on some \"Jazz in the Classroom\" albums. Clausen taught at Berklee for a year after graduation.\n\nHis son Scott is also a composer.\n\nClausen moved to Los Angeles, California in 1967 in search of television work, wanting to become a full-time composer. For nine years he did some arrangement work for singers, ghostwriting and other composing jobs such as commercial jingles, as well as working as a teacher, music copyist and a bassist. He worked as a copyist on \"Come On Get Happy\", the theme song to \"The Partridge Family\". He eventually became a score writer and later the music director and conductor for \"Donny & Marie\" between 1976 and 1979. Initially he was requested to write an emergency chart for the following day, but he was hired as a score writer and continued writing and conducting on the show, before replacing Tommy Oliver as music director. When the show moved to Utah, Clausen flew there each week from Los Angeles to record the score. He had the same role on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Hour\" in 1979. In 1981 he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement In Music Direction for \"Omnibus\".\n\nClausen served as the composer for the series \"Moonlighting\" from 1985 to 1989, scoring 63 of the 65 episodes. His favorite episode to score was the episode \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\", which featured two lengthy black and white dream sequences and enjoyed the episode \"Atomic Shakespeare\", also a fantasy episode. He received an Emmy nomination for each episode in the category Outstanding Achievement In Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore) in 1986 and 1987, earning two more nominations over the next two years for the episodes \"Here's Living with You, Kid\" and \"A Womb with a View\". In 1988 and 1989 he also received nominations for the Emmy for Outstanding Achievement In Music Direction. He was also the composer on \"ALF\" from 1986 to 1990.\n\nOther television compositions included \"Wizards and Warriors\" (1983), \"Fame\" (1984), \"Lime Street\" (1985), \"Christine Cromwell\" (1989) and \"My Life and Times\" (1991) as well as the television films \"Murder in Three Acts\" (1986), \"Double Agent\" (1987), \"Police Story: The Watch Commander\" (1988), \"My First Love\" (1988), \"She Knows Too Much\" (1989) and the feature film \"Number One with a Bullet\" (1987). He also conducted the orchestras and, for some, provided additional music for several films including \"The Beastmaster\" (1982), \"\" (1982), \"Splash\" (1984), \"Weird Science\" (1985), \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986), \"Dragnet\" (1987) and \"The Naked Gun\" (1988).\n\nFollowing \"ALF\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s conclusion, Clausen was unemployed for seven months. Clausen's friend suggested him to a producer from the Fox animated series \"The Simpsons\" who were looking for a new composer. Clausen \"had no interest in doing animation\" and \"wanted to be a \"drama\" composer.\" However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him \"we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way.\" Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the \"emotion [should be] scored first and the action scored second\", unlike many other cartoons, and that \"scoring the emotions of the characters\" was the primary aim for \"The Simpsons\". Clausen's first episode was \"Treehouse of Horror\", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles through the end of the 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57 musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead \"[gives] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies.\" He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode \"Cape Feare\", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie \"Cape Fear\", composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.\n\nClausen has received two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on \"The Simpsons\", winning the award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics two years in a row. The first was for \"We Put The Spring In Springfield\" from the 1997 episode \"Bart After Dark\", the second was for \"You're Checkin' In\" from the 1998 episode \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\"; the lyrics of each song were written by Ken Keeler. He has been nominated in the category a further seven times in 1994, 1995, 1996, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Clausen has also received twelve nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) between 1992 and 2011 and has twice been nominated for Outstanding Music Direction, in 1997 and 1998. With 30 nominations, Clausen has received more Emmy nominations than any other musician.\n\nHe has won five Annie Awards for his work on \"The Simpsons\". He won the 1997 award for Best Music in a TV Production, the award for Outstanding Music in an Animated Television Production in 1998, again for \"You're Checkin' In\", the same award in 2000 for the episode \"Behind the Laughter\", the award for Best Music in an Animated Television Production in 2003 for \"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\", and again in 2007 for \"Yokel Chords\".\n\nHis work on the show has been released as part of three albums produced by Clausen: \"Songs in the Key of Springfield\" (1997), \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\" (1999) and \"\" (2007). Clausen was not asked to score the film adaptation of the show, \"The Simpsons Movie\", with Hans Zimmer getting the job. He noted: \"sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug\".\n\nWhilst working on \"The Simpsons\", Clausen scored \"The Critic\" from 1994 to 1995 and \"Bette\" in 2000. He also scored the 1998 film \"Half Baked\". He recorded the album \"Swing Can Really Hang You Up The Most\" in 2003, comprising the arrangements he made over his career, performed by his jazz orchestra, after self-financing it.\n\nIn 2011, Clausen was awarded the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Golden Note Award. ASCAP President Paul Williams said his \"decades of scores for \"The Simpsons\" and other TV programs and films are as endlessly inventive as the imaginations of the shows' writers and animators. It takes a lot of serious work and thought to compose, arrange and conduct such wonderfully happy music.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2017, after 27 years of scoring for \"The Simpsons\", it was revealed that Clausen was dismissed from the show, with suggestions that the reasons behind the decision were largely financial. His last complete score was for \"Dogtown\". However, following the news of Clausen's departure, the producers of the show stated that he would \"continue to have an ongoing role in the show.\" Beginning with Season 29, scoring was taken over by Bleeding Fingers Music, with Clausen credited as \"Composer Emeritus.\" He is credited for composing the music for the episode \"Whistler's Father\".\n\nOn August 5, 2019, Clausen announced he is suing the Fox Network for his removal from the show, saying that he was fired due to old age.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877273", "title": "Greasemonkey", "text": "Greasemonkey\n\nGreasemonkey is a userscript manager made available as a Mozilla Firefox extension. It enables users to install scripts that make on-the-fly changes to web page content after or before the page is loaded in the browser (also known as augmented browsing).\n\nThe changes made to the web pages are executed every time the page is viewed, making them effectively permanent for the user running the script.\n\nGreasemonkey can be used for customizing page appearance, adding new functions to web pages (for example, embedding price comparisons within shopping sites), fixing rendering bugs, combining data from multiple web pages, and numerous other purposes.\n\nThe Greasemonkey project began 28 November 2004, written by Aaron Boodman. Boodman was inspired to write Greasemonkey after looking at a Firefox extension designed to clean up the interface of AllMusic. This extension was written by Adrian Holovaty, who later became a userscript developer. By May 2005, there were approximately 60 general and 115 site-specific userscripts distributed for Greasemonkey. During this time, a Greasemonkey compiler was also developed for converting a userscript into a standalone Firefox extension. Greasemonkey was initially met with complaints by publishers for its ability to block ads. However, this criticism shifted its focus to other addons starting with the 2006 release of Adblock Plus.\n\nTo accommodate the growing number of scripts, userscripts.org was founded by Britt Selvitelle and other members of the Greasemonkey community in late 2005. Userscripts.org was open sourced in 2007 but the site later moved away from this code base. As the main script repository listed on Greasemonkey's official site, userscripts.org accumulated thousands of scripts per year.\n\nIn 2010, the last known admin Jesse Andrews posted that the site was in maintenance mode due to lack of time and asked for a new maintainer to volunteer. Nevertheless, he remained the sole admin of the site until a discussion about install counts began on 1 April 2013. Prior to this, many of the \"most popular scripts\" as listed by the site had nominal install counts of zero. Over the following year spam scripts became more common, server downtime increased and the install count bug remained. With no further communication by Andrews, userscript writers described the site as neglected and the official Greasemonkey site removed its front page link. In response, script writers and other developers began working on the fork \"openuserjs.org\", and later greasyfork.org, as an immediate replacement.\n\nIn May 2014, userscripts.org became inaccessible on port 80, prompting users to access it on port 8080 instead. In August 2014, the site was shut down completely. Most of its scripts were backed up to the static mirror userscripts-mirror.org where they can now be found.\n\nGreasemonkey user scripts are written in JavaScript and manipulate the contents of a web page using the Document Object Model interface. Scripts are generally written to be either page-specific or domain-specific (applying to all pages within a domain) but may also be tagged to apply to all domains for global browser enhancements. Users of Greasemonkey can write or download scripts and save them to their own personal library. When users visit a website matching a script in their personal script library, Greasemonkey invokes the relevant scripts.\n\nGreasemonkey scripts can modify a webpage in any way that JavaScript allows, with certain Greasemonkey security restrictions. Scripts can also access other web pages and web services via a non-domain-restricted XMLHTTP request, allowing external content to be merged with the original page content.\n\nScripts are named \"somename\".user.js, and Greasemonkey offers to install any such script when a URL ending in that suffix is requested. Greasemonkey scripts contain metadata which specifies the name of the script, a description, resources required by the script, a namespace URL used to differentiate identically named scripts, and URL patterns for which the script is intended to be invoked or not.\n\nWriting a Greasemonkey script is similar to writing JavaScript for a web page, with some additional allowances such as cross-site XMLHttpRequests. Compared to writing a full-fledged Firefox extension, user scripting is a very modest step up in complexity from basic web programming. However, Greasemonkey scripts are limited due to security restrictions imposed by Mozilla's XPCNativeWrappers For example, Greasemonkey scripts do not have access to many of Firefox's components, such as the download manager, I/O processes or its main toolbars. Additionally, Greasemonkey scripts run per instance of a matching webpage. Because of this, managing lists of items globally is difficult. However, script writers have been using cookies and Greasemonkey even offers APIs such as GM_getValue and GM_setValue to overcome this.\n\nFile hosting servers for Greasemonkey require that the URLs for the scripts end with codice_1 and not with a MIME type like codice_2. Support for HTTPS will meet with Greasemonkey's built in update checker. As of July 2019, the Greasemonkey project lists three recommended user script hostings:\n\n\nGreasemonkey is available for Firefox, Flock and GNOME Web (formerly called Epiphany). The Greasemonkey extension for Web is part of the Web extensions package. However, this extension is not fully compatible as of release 2.15.1, since some Greasemonkey API functions (e.g. \"GM_getValue\") are unsupported. There are also custom versions for SeaMonkey, Songbird, Pale Moon, qutebrowser and Falkon browser.\n\n"}

The federal government's expanded role nationally and internationally beginning in the 1930s raised new issues for senatorial action, which in turn required increased staff assistance and created crowded conditions in the Capitol and the original Senate Office Building. When World War II delayed implementation of the Senate's building plans, the space problems grew increasingly urgent. Soon after the war, the United States Congress passed the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, in order to modernize and streamline its operations and provide senators and committees with professional staff assistance. To house the additional staff, the Senate resorted to renting space in nearby buildings. Moreover, with the anticipated admission of Alaska and Hawaii as states, four new senators would also require office space. As pressure for more space mounted, the Senate in 1948 acquired property on which to erect a second office building in order to accommodate the enlarged staff.\n\nThe consulting architects, Otto R. Eggers and Daniel Paul Higgins firm Eggers & Higgins of New York City, drew the plans for a seven-story building faced in white marble, to be located across First Street from the Old Senate Office Building (Russell Senate Office Building) and diagonally across the Capitol grounds from the Senate wing of the Capitol. Although more streamlined and less ornate, the new building was designed to harmonize with the Capitol and the first Senate Office Building. Bronze spandrels between the third- and fourth-floor windows depicted scenes from American industry: Shipping, Farming, Manufacturing, Mining and Lumbering. Below the new building's west pediment is the inscription: “The Senate is the Living Symbol of Our Union of States.”\n\nAlthough the Senate approved the plans for the new building in 1949, construction was delayed until 1956. By then, increased costs of construction caused some scaling back of the original design, including the elimination of a planned central corridor. With Architect of the Capitol J. George Stewart looking on, members of the Senate Office Building Commission laid the cornerstone on July 13, 1956, and the new office building opened on October 15, 1958.\n\nThe Dirksen Building was designed to accommodate the television era, complete with committee hearing rooms equipped with rostrums that were better suited to listening to testimony than sitting around conference tables, as had been done in previous committee rooms, both in the U.S. Capitol and the Russell Senate Office Building. In the 1970s, a third Senate office building, the Hart Senate Office Building was built next to the Dirksen Building on a spot originally intended for a mirror image of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The Hart and Dirksen Buildings are connected, and one can walk between the two almost as easily as if they were one structure.\n\nThe building was renovated during 1999–2000 under the auspices of the Architect of the Capitol, who at the time was Alan M. Hantman, FAIA. Day-to-day supervision of the project carried out by Assistant Architect Michael G. Turnbull, FAIA. The renovation was well received by Senators and their staff. Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah, Chairman of the Senate Legislative Branch Subcommittee, made the following comments regarding the renovation:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877290", "title": "Jiang Ziya", "text": "Jiang Ziya\n\nJiang Ziya ( century ), also known by several other names, was a Chinese noble who helped kings Wen and Wu of Zhou overthrow the Shang in ancient China. Following their victory at Muye, he continued to serve as a Zhou minister. He remained loyal to the regent Duke of Zhou during the Rebellion of the Three Guards; following the Duke's punitive raids against the restive Eastern Barbarians or \"Dongyi\", Jiang was enfeoffed with their territory as the marchland of Qi. He established his seat at Yingqiu (in modern Linzi).\nThe first marquis of Qi bore the given name Shang. The nobility of ancient China bore two surnames, an ancestral name and a clan name. His were Jiang and Lü, respectively. He had two courtesy names, Shangfu and Ziya, which were used for respectful address by his peers. The names Jiang Shang and Jiang Ziya became the most common after their use in the popular Ming-era novel \"Fengshen Bang\", written over 2,500 years after his death.\n\nFollowing the elevation of Qi to a duchy, his posthumous name became the , often mistakenly translated as if it were a name (\"Duke Tai\"). It is under this name that he appears in Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\". He is also less often known as \"Grand Duke Jiang\", the \"Hopeful Great Duke\", and the \"Hopeful Lü\".\n\nThe last ruler of the Shang dynasty, King Zhou of Shang, was a tyrannical and debauched slave owner who spent his days carousing with his favourite concubine Daji and mercilessly executing or punishing upright officials and all others who objected to his ways. After faithfully serving the Shang court for approximately twenty years, Jiang came to find King Zhou of Shang insufferable, and feigned madness in order to escape court life and the ruler's power. Jiang was an expert in military affairs and hoped that someday someone would call on him to help overthrow the king. Jiang disappeared, only to resurface in the Zhou countryside at the apocryphal age of seventy-two, when he was recruited by King Wen of Zhou and became instrumental in Zhou affairs. It is said that, while in exile, he continued to wait placidly, fishing in a tributary of the Wei River (near today’s Xi'an) using a barbless hook or even no hook at all, on the theory that the fish would come to him of their own volition when they were ready.\n\nKing Wen of Zhou, (central Shaanxi), found Jiang Ziya fishing. King Wen, following the advice of his father and grandfather before him, was in search of talented people. In fact, he had been told by his grandfather, the Grand Duke of Zhou, that one day a sage would appear to help rule the Zhou state.\n\nThe first meeting between King Wen and Jiang Ziya is recorded in the book that records Jiang's teachings to King Wen and King Wu, the \"Six Secret Teachings\" (太公六韜 / 太公六韬). The meeting was recorded as being characterized by a mythic aura common to meetings between great historical figures in ancient China. Before going hunting, King Wen consulted his chief scribe to perform divination in order to discover if the king would be successful. The divinations revealed that, \"'While hunting on the north bank of the Wei river you will get a great catch. It will not be any form of dragon, nor a tiger or great bear. According to the signs, you will find a duke or marquis there whom Heaven has sent to be your teacher. If employed as your assistant, you will flourish and the benefits will extend to three generations of Zhou Kings.'\" Recognizing that the result of this divination was similar to the result of divinations given to his eldest ancestor, King Wen observed a vegetarian diet for three days in order to spiritually purify himself for the meeting. While on the hunt, King Wen encountered Jiang fishing on a grass mat, and courteously began a conversation with him concerning military tactics and statecraft. The subsequent conversation between Jiang Ziya and King Wen forms the basis of the text in the \"Six Secret Teachings\".\n\nWhen King Wen met Jiang Ziya, at first sight he felt that this was an unusual old man, and began to converse with him. He discovered that this white-haired fisherman was actually an astute political thinker and military strategist. This, he felt, must be the man his grandfather was waiting for. He took Jiang Ziya in his coach to the court and appointed him prime minister and gave him the title Jiang Taigong Wang (\"The Great Duke's Hope\", or \"The expected of the Great Duke\") in reference to a prophetic dream Danfu, grandfather of Wenwang, had had many years before. This was later shortened to Jiang Taigong. King Wu married Jiang Ziya's daughter Yi Jiang, who bore him several sons.\n\nAfter King Wen died, his son King Wu, who inherited the throne, decided to send troops to overthrow the King of Shang. But Jiang Taigong stopped him, saying: \"While I was fishing at Panxi, I realised one truth – if you want to succeed you need to be patient. We must wait for the appropriate opportunity to eliminate the King of Shang\". Soon it was reported that the people of Shang were so oppressed that no one dared speak. King Wu and Jiang Taigong decided this was the time to attack, for the people had lost faith in the ruler. The bloody Battle of Muye then ensued some 35 kilometres from the Shang capital Yin (modern day Anyang, Henan Province).\n\nJiang Taigong charged at the head of the troops, beat the battle drums and then with 100 of his men drew the Shang troops to the southwest. King Wu's troops moved quickly and surrounded the capital. The Shang King had sent relatively untrained slaves to fight. This, plus the fact that many surrendered or revolted, enabled Zhou to take the capital.\n\nKing Zhou set fire to his palace and perished in it, and King Wu and his successors as the Zhou dynasty established rule over all of China. As for Daji, one version has it that she was captured and executed by the order of Jiang Taigong himself, another that she took her own life, another that she was killed by King Zhou. Jiang Taigong was made duke of the State of Qi (today’s Shandong province), which thrived with better communications and exploitation of its fish and salt resources under him.\n\nAs the most notable Prime Minister employed by King Wen and King Wu, he was declared \"the master of strategy\"—resulting in the Zhou government growing far stronger than that of the Shang Dynasty as the years elapsed.\n\nAn account of Jiang Ziya's life written long after his time says he held that a country could become powerful only when the people prospered. If the officials enriched themselves while the people remained poor, the ruler would not last long. The major principle in ruling a country should be to love the people; and to love the people meant to reduce taxes and corvée labour. By following these ideas, King Wen is said to have made the Zhou state prosper very rapidly.\n\nHis treatise on military strategy, Six Secret Strategic Teachings, is considered one of the Seven Military Classics of Ancient China.\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty he was accorded his own state temple as the martial patron and thereby attained officially sanctioned status approaching that of Confucius.\n\n\nIn Chinese and Taoist belief, Jiang Ziya is sometimes considered to have been a Taoist adept. In one legend, he used the knowledge he gained at Kunlun to defeat the Shang's supernatural protectors Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er using the blood of a black dog. He is also a prominent character in the Ming-era \"Romance of the Investiture of the Gods\", in which he is Daji's archrival and is personally responsible for her execution.\nThere are two \"xiehouyu\" about him:\n\nIn the scenario \"Chinese Unification\" of the \"\" expansion pack, Jiang Ziya is the leader of the State of Qi.\n\nThe protagonist of \"Hoshin Engi\", Taikoubou (Tai Gong Wang), is based on Jiang Ziya. However, his personality is quite comical.\n\n\nJiang Ziya is Daji's arch-rival (Jiang Ziya never thought of Daji as his rival while Daji herself actually thought that Jiang Ziya was her rival) as Jiang Ziya can easily see through Daji's plans.\n\nJiang Ziya is a playable character in Koei's \"Warriors Orochi 2\". In the game, he is alternatively referred to as Taigong Wang. A stark contrast to the historical accounts however, would be that he is portrayed as a handsome young man, who is quite arrogant, although he is still a divinely gifted strategist and a good man at heart. He is often referred to by others, namely Fu Xi, Nüwa and Daji as \"boy\". The reason for his radically improvised design may be to emphasize his rivalry with Daji, whose character design depicts her as being young and beautiful as well. Their clashes are loosely inspired by the \"Fengshen Yanyi\".\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy XI\", the item \"Lu Shang's Fishing Rod\" is awarded to players for catching 10,000 carp. It is noteworthy for its ability to catch both small and large fish, and is notoriously hard to break.\n\nIn the online game \"War of Legends\", Jiang Ziya is a playable monk, with 45 \"ability.\"\n\nIn the popular game Eiyuu Senki, Tai Gong Wang is one female amongst the ancient heroes player will encounter in the game.\n\nIn \"Dragalia Lost\", Jiang Ziya is the name of a female Qilin adventurer that is possibly obtainable.\n\n\n"}

The incumbent Member of Parliament is Thangam Debbonaire, of the Labour Party.\n\nAshley sends three councillors to Bristol City Council. Currently, these are Mike Davies and Carole Johnson of the Labour Party, and Jude English of the Green Party. All three councillors were elected in May 2016. The MP was re-elected in the UK General Election in December 2019.\n\nBaptist Mills is a small area of Bristol, located between St Werburghs and Easton. It was home to a brass works between 1700 and 1840, and a pottery between 1840 and 1891. The area is now often regarded as part of St Werburghs. In the 19th century, part of Baptist Mills was also known as Botany Bay and regarded as a fairly lawless area.\n\nMontpelier is an area of North Bristol. It is bounded by Cheltenham Road to the west, St Paul's to the south, St Werburgh's to the east and St Andrew's to the north. It has its own railway station, and a reputation as bohemian. Picton Street is a haven for lovers of organic and vegetarian cuisine.\n\nPreviously, Montpelier was carved by French prisoners of war (POWs) from the Napoleonic conflicts. Almost all streets are named after famous generals or have military connotations, such as Wellington, York and Banner Roads. Stories are told of the POWs transporting spoil from the New Cut to lay the foundations for the terrace housing. Original cobble stones laid by the POW's can be seen in the gutters and some secluded alleys.\n\nPicton Street was built and named in honour of Sir Thomas Picton who, as Captain Picton, in 1783 endeared himself to Bristolians by bravely facing the rebellious 75th Regiment on College Green and averting a military mutiny. There is a double-bayed villa in the street named after him, Picton Lodge.\n\nSt Andrew's is a suburb of Bristol situated about 3 km (1.8 miles) north of the city centre. The area was developed in the late 19th century as St Andrew's Park Estate, and consists mostly of large Victorian villas, with some inter-war housing and some minor rebuilding in Cromwell Road and Belvoir Road following enemy action in World War II.\n\nThe area is roughly bounded by the Severn Beach Railway Line, Gloucester Road, Somerville Road and Cromwell Road; however the boundary is debatable: according to the Ordnance Survey map this area is Montpelier, whereas according to the National Gazetteer of 1868, Montpelier is a hamlet within the Parish of St Andrew's. St Andrew's Church, which gave the area its name, was in St Andrew's Road, Montpelier. The church was demolished in 1969.\n\nThe David Thomas Memorial church was erected 1879–1881 and demolished in 1987, destroying most of a Gothic fantasy by Stuart Colman. The building still retains a thin octagonal spire and west front but the massive halls, apse and rib vaults have now gone in favour of flats by Stride Treglown.\n\nIn the mid 20th century, the area became unfashionable and many of the houses were converted to multiple occupation. However, during the 1990s, the area became fashionable again and consequently many houses are now being converted back into family homes.\n\nSt Andrew's is well served by public transport, with frequent buses to all parts of the city from Gloucester Road, buses to University of West England's Frenchay Campus and a local train service from Montpelier to Bristol Temple Meads, Clifton and Avonmouth on the Severn Beach Line.\n\nSt Andrew's Park is at the heart of the area. The park was laid out in 1895, and is home to events such as 'Music in the Park' during the summer, and 'Carols in the Park' at Christmas. The park features a well-sized children's play area, permanent paddling pool (serviced and used only in the summer months) and public toilets (limited opening hours). Despite being located on a hilly incline, the park is well used for football and frisbee throughout the year. On 30 April 1941 a Wellington bomber on a night training flight crashed in the park after hitting barrage balloon cables. There is now a memorial to the crash in the park. A website has been created about the crash.\n\nSt Paul's is an inner suburb of Bristol, England, situated just north east of the city centre and west of the M32.

{"id": "1877307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877307", "title": "High-key lighting", "text": "High-key lighting\n\nHigh-key lighting is a style of lighting for film, television, or photography that aims to reduce the lighting ratio present in the scene. This was originally done partly for technological reasons, since early film and television did not deal well with high contrast ratios, but now is used to suggest an upbeat mood. It is often used in sitcoms and comedies. High-key lighting is usually quite homogeneous and free from dark shadows. The terminology comes from the higher balance in the ratio between the key light and the fill light in a traditional three point lighting setup.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, high-key lighting was achieved through multiple light sources lighting a scene—usually using three fixtures per person (left, right, and central) —which resulted in a uniform lighting pattern with very little modeling. Nowadays, multiple hot light sources are replaced with much more efficient fluorescent soft lights which provide a similar effect.\n\nThe advantage to high-key lighting is that it doesn't require adjustment for each scene which allows the production to complete the shooting in hours instead of days. The primary drawback is that high-key lighting fails to add meaning or drama by lighting certain parts more prominently than others.\n\nShows with bigger budgets have moved away from high-key lighting by using lighting set-ups different from the standard three-point lighting. Part of the reason for this is the advent of new lighting fixtures which are easier to use and quicker to set up. Another reason is the growing sophistication of the audience for TV programs and the need to differentiate.\n\nHigh-key lighting found its use in classical Hollywood cinema because it was well suited for three-point lighting and other filmmaking traditions.\nIt is an overall lighting design which uses the fill light and backlight to create low contrast between brighter and darker areas. It can be used for both daylight and night scenes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1877308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877308", "title": "Bangor Abbey", "text": "Bangor Abbey\n\nBangor Abbey was established by Saint Comgall in 558 in Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland and was famous for its learning and austere rule. It is not to be confused with the slightly older abbey in Wales on the site of Bangor Cathedral.\n\nComgall founded the monastery at Bangor about 558 A.D. in the County Down, on the southern shore of Belfast Lough. The ancient Annals differ about the exact year, giving various dates between 552 and 559. The earliest, the Annals of Tighernach, and the Annals of Innisfallen, give 558 A.D. as the date of the foundation. The name was sometimes written \"Beannchor\". The place was also called the \"Vale of Angels\", because, according to a popular legend, St. Patrick once rested there and saw the valley filled with angels.\n\nComgall was born in Antrim in 517, and educated at Clooneenagh and Clonmacnoise. The spirit of monasticism was then strong in Ireland. Many sought solitude the better to serve God, and with this object Comgall retired to a lonely island. The persuasions of his friends drew him from his retreat; later on he founded the monastery of Bangor.\n\nUnder his rule, which was rigid, prayer and fasting were incessant. Food was scant and plain. Worship held the foremost place in the life of the community. It is clear that music was a prominent feature of the worship of the Bangor monks. Crowds came to share his penances and his vigils; they also came for learning.\n\nBangor Abbey is regarded as one of the most important of the early Northern Irish monastic sites, second only to Armagh. Within the extensive rampart which encircled its monastic buildings, students studied scripture, theology, logic, geometry, arithmetic, music, and the classics. Mo Sinu moccu Min was the fifth abbot of Bangor. It is thought that he tutored Columbanus. Robin Flower wrote that \"It is clear that particular attention was paid to historical studies at Bangor, and the earliest Irish chronicle was probably a production of that house.\"\n\nBangor was a major center of learning—called the \"Light of the World\"—and trained many missionaries. Carthach of Lismore studied at Bangor, as did Fintan of Doon. Saint Mirin was a prior at Bangor before leaving to found Paisley Abbey in Renfrewshire. Columbanus and Gall went off to Continental Europe in 590 AD and founded the famous monasteries of Luxiell (France), St Gallen (Switzerland) and Bobbio (Italy).\n\nLike many early Irish monasteries, Bangor was destroyed and rebuilt on a number of occasions. The Annals of Ulster record that Bangor was burned in 616 and again in 755. No doubt at this period the buildings were constructed of wood. Easily accessible from the sea, Bangor invited attack, and between 822 and 824 the Norsemen plundered it. The Annals of Ulster and the Four Masters both record that during this raid, “learned men and bishops” were smitten, while the shrine containing the relics of Comgall was taken. Another probable victim of the Vikings was “Tanaidhe MacUidhir, coarb of Bennchor, who was killed in 958. There is a consensus that the importance of Bangor declined around the latter part of the tenth century.\n\nWhen St. Malachy, in 1121, became Abbot of Bangor he had to build everything anew. However, three years later he was promoted to the See of Down, and Bangor again decayed. By the Statute of Kilkenny the \"mere Irishmen\" were excluded from making profession there.\n\nIn 1469, the Franciscans had possession of it, and a century later the Augustinians, after which, at the dissolution of the monasteries in that part of Ireland, it was given by James I to Sir James Hamilton who repaired the church in 1617 and was buried in it when he died in 1644. It appears that stone from the abbey was used in the construction of the new church. All that remains of the Abbey ruins is St. Malachy's Wall.\n\nThe present Tower of the church dates back to the 14th century.\nA mural in the church is of Christ ascending to heaven with Saints Comgall, Gall and Columbanus at his feet.\n\nThe Antiphonary of Bangor was probably written by the monks of Bangor Abbey between 602 and 691. It was housed at Bobbio in Italy for over 1000 years. The manuscript, which contains a collection of Latin hymns, prayers and antiphons is one of\nthe earliest surviving dateable monastic manuscripts from Ireland and has been described as one of the most precious surviving\nwitnesses to the early Irish church. The manuscript provides an important insight into monastic life in Ireland and is also testament to the artistic and literary standard of the work attributed to the monks of Bangor in the seventh century.\n\nNothing now remains of the original buildings of Comgall's monastery. In the Private Chapel at Clandeboye, however, may be seen, built into the wall, the shaft of a Cross, which was found in the Abbey precincts. This is a fragment of a Celtic High Cross, which may have stood on \"the Cross Hill\" adjacent to Bangor Castle, and which is indicated on a 17th-century map. This fragment probably dates from about the 8th century.\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1838, and is now used for watersports, as well as supplying water to the canal system.\n\nThe Dudley Canal Line No 2 followed a circuitous route, but in the 1830s Thomas Brewin was responsible for building a more direct route. The total length of the new canal, which opened in 1838, was about , which included a tunnel, known as Brewin's Tunnel. The new route enabled a reservoir to be built over the old course of the canal, together with a steam-powered pumping engine. The tunnel did not last long, as it was opened out in 1858, necessitating the construction of a bridge to carry the lane which had previously crossed over the top of the tunnel. The bridge is now called High Bridge, and the lane is called Highbridge Road.\n\nThe reservoir, which was built between 1835 and 1838, acted as a storage reservoir, so that when water was plentiful, as a result of rain, it could be pumped from the canal into the reservoir, and then released back into the canal through sluices near the tunnel when it was required. The engine was installed in 1840, and drove a scoop wheel. A cottage was provided for the sluice keeper.\n\nWith the nationalisation of the canals in 1948, ownership of the reservoir passed from the Birmingham Canal Navigations, with whom the Dudley Canal had amalgamated in 1846, to British Waterways. They sold it to Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council in 1966, who wanted to improve the leisure facilities within their area, and have since developed it for watersports, although it still supplies water to the canal.\n\nThe reservoir now hosts watersports including scuba diving, yachting and water skiing. The Dudley Water Ski and Yacht Club began as an informal society in 1963, and negotiated with Dudley Council to allow them to use the reservoir for their activities. Changing rooms and a clubhouse were built, and the use of the reservoir was shared with two diving clubs, although they remained independent of the original club. Subsequently, the club became the Dudley Water Sports Centre, and registered with Companies House as a private limited company in 1997.\n\nThe Dudley Dolphin BSAC diving club began as a group of like-minded divers in 1959. Negotiations with the Water Ski and Yacht Club were not initially successful, as the activities appeared to conflict, but a suitable compromise was worked out in 1964, and the club was formed by constitution. Diving was suspended in 1967, as swimmers were perceived as a hazard to boats, but more negotiations led to a trial reinstatement of the activity in October 1968, and it became permanent in December 1969. The club did not affiliate to the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), as they were carrying out research into fish in the reservoir, while the BSAC supported spearfishing. However, the situation had changed by 1976, and they are now part of that organisation, with all of the trainers holding BSAC qualifications.\n\nIn March 1976, members were concerned both about the threat of certain dive sites being closed to non-BSAC clubs and about the possible need of obtaining internationally recognised qualifications to enable them to dive abroad. This led to the Dudley Dolphin club becoming an open branch of the British Sub Aqua club. Dudley Dolphin BSAC has training sessions at Dudley Leisure Centre every Friday (and will be moving to new the facility on completion), with Friday night diving and Sunday morning diving at the reservoir. The club is a diving and snorkelling club with an active membership of over 60 members. \n\nIn 1973 a group of Black Country scuba diving enthusiasts founded Dudley Nautilus Sub Aqua Club and in February 2016 they celebrated 40 years of being a BSAC branch. Dudley Nautilus hold weekly dives at the Reservoir on Saturday mornings and training sessions at Halesowen Leisure Centre on Thursday evenings.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1995 to 1996 as a member of Dudley family under the ring name Dudley Dudley.\n\nBradley was born in San Antonio, Texas and raised in Brandon, Florida. As a child, he attended wrestling shows at the Fort Homer Hesterly Armory along with his family, and thus developed an interest in wrestling. As an adult, he began training under Joe Malenko and his brother Dean. Bradley was also one of the last wrestlers to receive training from Hiro Matsuda, who was visiting the Malenko's school in order to train Osamu Nishimura when Bradley began training. His first match took place in Tampa, Florida and saw Bradley wrestle Gary Nice.\n\nFollowing a 1993 tour of Australia as part of Dean Malenko's Wrestle Riot group, Bradley, upon his return to America, was brought into the World Wrestling Federation by Jimmy Del Ray. Bradley was given the ring name \"Charlie Hunter\", and worked for the WWF for two years, in the course of which he wrestled both The British Bulldog and Shawn Michaels and appeared on \"Monday Night Raw\".\n\nRenamed \"Dudley Dudley\", Bradley arrived in ECW on July 1, 1995. He was billed as being part of the Dudley family along with his storyline half-brothers Snot Dudley and Big Dick Dudley. Dudley Dudley was known for his deep voice and strange laugh during interviews, and had the distinction of being \"the only pure Dudley\" - while all the Dudleys allegedly had (the apocryphal) Big Daddy Dudley as a common father, Dudley Dudley was the only Dudley who had (the equally fictitious) Momma Dudley as a mother. As a result, Dudley Dudley was the unquestioned leader of the stable.\n\nThe Dudley Boys feuded with The Pitbulls, and were members of Raven's Nest. In late 1995, the Dudleys were joined by Dances with Dudley and Buh Buh Ray Dudley. Dudley Dudley teamed with Dances With Dudley after his former partner, Snot, was badly injured in a jet ski accident. He left ECW in early 1996 after deciding to take a hiatus from wrestling.\n\nIn October 1997 Bradley appeared with WCW as a jobber. He had previously appeared with WCW as a jobber in 1995, wrestling Brian Pillman at a house show.\n\nBradley worked in Japan for Big Japan Pro Wrestling and the International Wrestling Association of Japan, competing in a variety of deathmatches, and toured the world, appearing in Africa and South America. In late 2004 Bradley toured Austria and Hungary with Chris Raaber's \"European Wrestling Association\". Bradley also toured Puerto Rico on several occasions as part of the International Wrestling Association, wrestling as \"Bad Boy Bradley\". He also was a member of Carlos Colons company (WWC) P.R.\n\nBradley returned to Florida and began wrestling on the independent circuit as \"The original Dudley Dudley\", and for \"IPW Hardcore\" as \"Evil Snack\", an evil chef with his proteges Von Tankard and Kubiak, who were known as The Snack Pack. He later began wrestling for NWA Florida, but was sidelined with a serious biceps injury in January 2004.\n\nBradley trained numerous wrestlers at Dean Malenko's \"School of professional wrestling\" in Tampa while Malenko was touring Japan, including Axis, Chad Collyer, Molly Holly, Jet Jaguar, Kane, Jeremy Lopez, Tony Mamaluke, Mike and Todd Shane, Rod Steel, Bruce Steele, and Mikey Tenderfoot. On December 1, 2004, Bradley became a trainer at Steve Keirn's \"School of Hard Knocks\", also located in Tampa.\n\nBradley returned to Puerto Rico and began wrestling in World Wrestling Council as Bad Boy Bradley. He made tag with Todd Dean and defeat Juventud Boricua (Chris Joel and Noriega) to win the WWC Tag Team Championship.\n\nKong made his debut for Birkenhead based All Star Wrestling, worked all over the U.K. and Wales along with Ireland and Scotland. A standout performer Bradley has also worked for Austrian wrestling promotion EWA on several occasions and held the EWA heavy weight belt in 2009 by defeating WWE developmental talent and champion Chris \"bambikiller\" Rabber in Leoben, Austria. Bradley was also noted for working WWF talent \"Just Joe\" Joe E. Legend drawing another sold out house for EWA. Bruiser Bradley also competed in a weekend-long catch-as-catch-can Far East Wrestling tournament in Kuwait City and by far was a top fan favorite.

{"id": "1877327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877327", "title": "Bizarre (TV series)", "text": "Bizarre (TV series)\n\nBizarre is a Canadian sketch comedy television series that aired from 1980 to 1986. The show was hosted by John Byner, and produced by CTV at the CFTO's Glen Warren Studios in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario for first-run airing in Canada on CTV and in the United States on the Showtime premium cable network.\n\nThe series featured slapstick sketches, monologues, TV parodies, and performances by guest stand-up comics. Byner's interactions with members of the studio audience, or with show producer Bob Einstein (who often came in to halt a sketch midway through), provided an early example of removing the fourth wall. Much of the humour on the show was considered risqué during the original run of the series.\n\nThe series utilized a rotating ensemble of supporting actors who backed Byner up in his sketches. Besides Einstein, this group included Philip Akin, Harvey Atkin, Billy Barty, Cynthia Belliveau, Jack Duffy, Jayne Eastwood, Barbara Hamilton, John Hemphill, Barry Flatman, Keith Knight, Don Lake, Kathleen Laskey, Kate Lynch, Pat Morita, Debra McGrath, Mike Myers, Earl Pennington, Melissa Steinberg, Billy Van, Steve Weston, and Wayne and Shuster alumnus Tom Harvey.\n\n\"Bizarre\" had guest star performers during its run including Steve Allen, Frances Bay, Redd Foxx, Luba Goy (who was concurrently with the \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\", at that time primarily a radio troupe), Victoria Jackson, Murray Langston (as The Unknown Comic), Howie Mandel, Second City alumnus Dave Thomas, Willie Tyler & Lester, Marc Weiner, Henny Youngman and others.\n\nA regular feature of the show was Super Dave Osborne (a spoof of daredevils such as Evel Knievel), portrayed by Bob Einstein, in which Super Dave would perform elaborate mock stunts meant to enthrall viewers; a reporter (usually Mike Walden) would assist in framing the sketch. Inevitably, the stunt would fail spectacularly, resulting in severe injury to Super Dave. These sketches would usually finish with a view of the scene, in which Super Dave was buried, encased, launched etc., as appropriate for the sketch. Meanwhile, feigning agony, Super Dave would discuss sundry details – information about the next show, why the stunt failed, or what he'd do to the reporter once he recovered from his injuries.\n\nOne notable Super Dave sketch was a stunt where he attempted to avoid being harmed while standing under a pile driver, by repeating the nonsense phrase \"balloon ball\". The stunt failed in typical Super Dave style, leaving him as a helmeted head atop two shoes. This particular sketch was popular enough that during the following season, Showtime ads for Bizarre featured a cartoon logo of Super Dave's helmeted head and shoes.\n\nThe Super Dave sketches led to a spin-off series (\"Super Dave\") with a more family-friendly style.\n\nTwo versions of the show were produced: episodes that aired on the Showtime cable network in the United States contained nudity and coarse language. The versions that aired on CTV (and later in syndication) had the nudity removed and the language bleeped by a horn-honking sound. Although the \"adult\" version is most closely associated with Showtime, it did go out on a few independent TV stations during the 1980s, playing as late-night fare, although the \"clean\" version is the one that was more commonly found in syndication. Current Canadian broadcast content regulations, which are more lenient than those of the 1980s, might permit broadcast of the uncensored Showtime versions, but they have not been offered for broadcast syndication.\n\nThe \"adult\" version was also shown regionally on ITV in the United Kingdom, usually airing after 11 PM and with some of the more extreme language bleeped out conventionally.\n\nSketches containing nudity were censored for Canadian television and syndication by the inclusion of reverse angle scenes originally filmed from behind nude actors (generally women baring their breasts) or else alternate scenes that had been filmed with the models wearing a bra. Rare scenes involving a woman being naked below the waist, however, just had the skits end very abruptly.\n\nThe \"adult\" version has not aired on television since the Showtime airings and original syndication ceased in the late 1980s. The syndicated episodes have been rebroadcast since.\n\n\"Bizarre\" was originally developed for ABC. In 1979, ABC was looking into re-entering the late night television field amid reports of Johnny Carson potentially leaving NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" due to a contract dispute. ABC made overtures to Carson and to Richard Dawson, then working for ABC as the host of their daytime game show \"Family Feud\" and also serving as Carson's regular guest host. Carson eventually renewed with NBC.\n\nDawson taped the pilot for \"Bizarre\" at CBS Television City in Hollywood. The special aired on ABC March 20, 1979. Ultimately, neither Dawson nor ABC decided to continue with the project (ABC instead went with \"Fridays\" and \"Nightline\"). Production moved to Canada (allowing the show to qualify for Canadian content credits, despite maintaining a mostly American cast) and impressionist John Byner was installed as host. The premiere of \"Bizarre\" used many of the same sketches as the Dawson pilot.\n\nDVDs of the unedited version, titled \"The Best of Bizarre Uncensored\", were released in late 2005 from Canadian video label Visual Entertainment and are available to buy from Canadian and US retailers. Nine individual volumes have been released as of July 2007.\n\nWhile the episodes appear to be uncensored regarding language and nudity, most are missing their original end credits, which included plugs for the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and Tilden Rent-a-Car. The only episodes to retain their original end credits are ones where live-action sketches are still taking place while the credits roll, and most of those episodes have the sponsorship plugs removed, with the exception of episode 47 (on Volume Five), due to Super Dave Osborne commenting on the plugs. A generic \"DVD credits\" roll appears on each disc to give credit to the people who worked on the show.\n\nThe \"adult\" version has not aired on television since the Showtime airings and original syndication ceased in the late 1980s. The syndicated episodes have been rebroadcast since then in Canada (as least as recently as 2003), where they were mostly scheduled to fulfill \"Canadian Content\" requirements.\n\nThe Comedy Network aired Bizarre from 1997-2003.\nTV Land Canada, later known as Comedy Gold, aired Bizarre from New Year's Eve 2008 to August 2011.\n\n"}

The vampire, Thorne, meets Marius de Romanus and inquires about Marius' past. Marius then provides his life story.\n\nAs a young Roman patrician, Marius was abducted by druids who were trying to find a replacement for their \"god of the grove\"—a vampire, kept locked inside a chamber underneath a tree, who took on the role of a god in a druidic religion. Marius does not want to receive the powers of the dying god, but is given them nonetheless.\n\nUnable to face a life imprisoned in a tree, Marius escapes from the druids (one of whom is Mael). He embarks on a trip to Egypt, where he learns of Akasha and Enkil, the Mother and Father or Those Who Must Be Kept—the progenitors of all vampire-kind. He takes them back to Rome with him after learning that if they die then every other vampire in the world will suffer the same fate.\n\nHe falls in love with a mortal woman, Pandora, and turns her into a vampire. They live together happily for a long time, although they argue frequently. One day, their house is attacked by a group of vampires who want to know the secrets of Those Who Must Be Kept. Though they destroy these vampires, the attack leads to an argument between the two and Marius, filled with anger, leaves Pandora.\n\nMarius then returns to Rome, where he creates a life for himself as a socialite, fraternizing with mortals and practicing painting. It is here that he meets Mael and Avicus, the latter of which is a former god of the grove—a vampire older than Marius, but who does not seem to know his own power. There is still much enmity between Mael and Marius, and Marius asks them to leave. They do so, but remain in the city of Rome. Marius does not mind this, as they keep the city free from other blood-drinkers who may pry the secrets of Those Who Must Be Kept from his mind. Marius continues to live this way even as the Roman Empire splits, with its capital city moving to Constantinople.\n\nEventually, Marius, Mael, and Avicus leave Rome when it is sacked by barbarians. They travel to Constantinople, taking with them the Mother and Father. There they meet a powerful vampire named Eudoxia, who wants Marius to put Those Who Must Be Kept into her care. After praying to Those Who Must Be Kept for an answer, he relents just far enough to allow Eudoxia to see them. After a series of violent conflicts, Marius angrily drags Eudoxia back down into the shrine and casts her at Akasha, who suddenly awakens to destroy her.\n\nRealizing that he cannot live with other vampires due to his custody of the Divine Parents, Marius elects to return to Italy. He becomes disheartened by the horrors of the Black Death and sleeps for hundreds of years. He awakes again during the Renaissance and travels all around Italy, visiting Venice and Florence, admiring the art and culture. In Rome he meets the vampire Santino, who claims that Marius is living in sin by not serving Satan. Marius threatens him and tells Santino to never come near him again.\n\nMarius decides to make his home in Venice, and he establishes himself as an amateur painter. His house is set up as a place where young boys can come and improve themselves, preparing to go to university or to become craftsmen. During this time, he also falls in love with the works of Botticelli, whom he briefly considers turning into a vampire.\n\nIt is in Venice that Marius meets Amadeo (Armand), whom he discovers in a filthy cellar, waiting to become a prostitute in the city's brothels. He purchases the boy from the slave traders and takes him back to his house, where he bathes him and promises him a better life.\n\nAs the years pass Marius happily continues his life, disappearing occasionally to attend to the Divine Parents. Amadeo grows up, and the two often share a bed. Marius is sorely tempted to give Amadeo the Dark Gift, making him into a vampire, but he stops himself from doing so.\n\nWhen Marius is away looking after the Divine Parents, his house is attacked by the Englishman Lord Harlech who became obsessed with Amadeo after sleeping with him. Amadeo manages to kill Harlech, but sustains several wounds from Harlech's poisoned blade. He slips into a fever. Marius arrives and is told that Amadeo will die as the poison is too strong. Marius turns Amadeo into a vampire in order to prevent the boy from dying. He teaches him to prey only on evildoers in order to save his conscience.\n\nSome time after Amadeo becomes a vampire, the house is attacked by a large mob of Satan-worshiping vampires under the leadership of Santino. Marius is burnt and almost killed, but manages to save his own life by jumping into a canal. Nonetheless, he is severely wounded and believes that Amadeo will be killed.\n\nHe calls a woman named Bianca to his aid. The two have known each other for a number of years and have a close relationship. Marius is too weak to hunt, so he transforms Bianca into a vampire in order to have her help him to recover his strength. The two move to the shrine of Those Who Must Be Kept and live there for over a century, where Marius gradually recovers his strength by drinking from Akasha.\n\nAfter Amadeo had transformed, Marius had met with Raymond Gallant, a man from the Talamasca, a group of scholars who found out information about supernatural things, just for information. He hears from him that Pandora is being kept hostage by another vampire and moved around Europe and Russia; so Marius decides to move to Dresden to try meeting with Pandora, whom he still loves. He does not tell Bianca of this. Marius does indeed find Pandora there, but discovers that she does not want to live with him and Bianca and wants to stay with her traveling companion, who was not holding her hostage after all. Marius offers to leave Bianca for Pandora, but Pandora refuses this offer. When Marius sees Bianca the next day, she declares that she is leaving him because she overheard what he said to Pandora. 50 years later, as he is shifting to America, Marius discovers a letter from Pandora offering to live with him if he comes to collect her at a certain place, but it is too late and she is gone.\n\nMarius then shelters a young vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who wakes up Akasha when playing a song for her on his violin. She comes to him and they drink each other's blood. Enkil is furious and almost crushes Lestat when a shocked Marius saves him. Marius sends Lestat away, thinking that he can pose a danger, but is sad that it is the fourth time he is losing a love. Years later, Marius brings a television into Those Who Must Be Kept's Chapel, for their entertainment. On this they see news, songs, etc. and also The Vampire Lestat's rock guitar music. This, Marius feels, corrupts their minds, and Akasha awakens from her slumber with the evil idea of taking over the world. She destroys Enkil and buries Marius in the ruins of his house, where he lies, injured.\n\nMarius lies there trapped, for weeks, but with the Mind Gift informs Lestat that he is in danger, and also asks for help. He is soon found by Pandora, and Santino—whom he tries to kill, but realises that all force would be needed to stop Akasha from her evil deed of taking over the world, killing all males and having a female-dominated world with her as the leader. A council is formed and the vampires try to convince Akasha, but she does not listen. Finally, Maharet's (who created Thorne) mute sister Mekare fights with Akasha and destroys her. That is the end of Marius's story through time.\n\nThe story then moves back to the present day, where Marius and Thorne are at a jungle hideaway with other old and powerful vampires—Amadeo (now going by the name Armand), Santino, Maharet, Mekare, and Pandora. Marius wants justice against Santino for taking Armand away from him, but Maharet refuses to let Marius kill Santino, who is weak. Thorne does not want to accept her decision and so kills Santino himself with the Fire Gift. In penance for his deed, he gives over his eyes to Maharet.\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling as a member of The Dudley Brothers under the ring name Snot Dudley in summer 1995. He is also known for his appearances with Smoky Mountain Wrestling in Tennessee and on the independent circuit in Florida and the northeastern United States.\n\nDeek relocated from New York City to Morristown, Tennessee to train as a professional wrestler under Tim Horner at the Smoky Mountain Wrestling training camp. He made his debut with Smoky Mountain Wrestling on August 21, 1993 as \"Anthony Michaels\", losing to Joe Cazana.\n\nIn March 1994, Deek was repackaged as the masked \"Fire\" and placed in a tag team with Brimstone called \"The Infernos\". The Infernos went on to compete in the SMW tag team division, competing against teams such as The Thrillseekers (Chris Jericho and Lance Storm) and The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Deek alternated between the two ring names until leaving SMW in February 1995.\n\nDeek debuted in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling on July 1, 1995 at Hardcore Heaven. Wearing overalls, a tie-dyed shirt, high-tops and glasses, Deek was given the gimmick of \"Lil' Snot Dudley\", one of the three original members of The Dudley Brothers along with Dudley Dudley and Big Dick Dudley. In their debut match, Snot Dudley and Dudley Dudley scored an upset victory over The Pitbulls.\n\nShortly after their debut, the Dudley family aligned themselves with Raven, joining Raven's Nest and feuding with The Pitbulls. At Heat Wave on July 15, 1995, Dudley Dudley and Snot Dudley teamed with Raven in a loss to Tommy Dreamer and The Pitbulls. Shortly thereafter, Deek was injured in a jet ski accident and left ECW, with his departure attributed to a broken pelvis resulting from a superbomb delivered by The Pitbulls at Heat Wave.\n\nAfter recovering from his injury, Deek returned to wrestling on the independent circuit in Florida. In 1998, Deek formed a tag team with Jeff Roth, who adopted the ring name \"Schmuck Dudley\". The duo wrestled for the Florida-based Future of Wrestling promotion as \"The Dudleys\". In 1999, Deek reverted to the ring name Anthony Michaels and Schmuck to Jeff Roth, changing the name of their tag team to \"Wildside\", then to \"Animal House\". The duo won the FOW Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 1998 and 2002. Deek remained with FOW until the promotion folded in 2003. Deek also wrestled for other independent promotions in Florida such as Florida Championship Wrestling and Coastal Championship Wrestling.\n\nIn 2003, Deek joined the Pennsylvania-based promotion World Xtreme Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with Mark Gore called \"The Untouchables\". The duo won the WXW Tag Team Championship in May 2004, holding the titles until August of that year. The Untouchables continued to wrestled intermittently for WXW over the following eight years. The duo also performed for other independent promotions in the northeastern United States such as the Connecticut-based Defiant Pro Wrestling and the Massachusetts-based Powerhouse Wrestling.\n\nDeek made a one-off appearance with World Wrestling Entertainment on the March 13, 2007 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\" as \"Mikey Deek\". Deek and Danny Jacks lost to Snitsky in a handicap match.\n\nIn 2010, Deek returned to the Future of Wrestling promotion after it was resurrected, repeatedly challenging for the FOW Heavyweight Championship and the FOW International Heavyweight Championship.

When he was two years old, Namkhai Norbu was recognized as the 'mindstream emanation', a tulku, of the Dzogchen teacher Adzom Drugpa (1842–1924). At five, he was also recognized as a mindstream emanation of an emanation of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594–1651). From an early age, Namkhai Norbu undertook an accelerated course of study, attending monastic college, taking retreats, and studying with renowned teachers, including some of the most important Tibetan masters of his time. Under the tutelage of these teachers, he completed the training required by the Buddhist tradition in both Sutrayana and Tantrayana. At the age of sixteen, he met master Rigdzin Changchub Dorje (1826–1961/1978), who became his principal Dzogchen teacher.\n\nIn 1960, he came to Italy at the invitation of Professor Giuseppe Tucci, and served as Professor of Tibetan and Mongolian Language and Literature from 1964 to 1992 at the Naples Eastern University. Namkhai Norbu was widely recognized as a leading authority on Tibetan culture, particularly in the fields of history, literature, and Traditional Tibetan medicine and astrological sciences such as the Tibetan calendar. In 1983, he hosted the first International Convention on Tibetan Medicine, held in Venice, Italy.\n\nIn 1976, Namkhai Norbu began to give Dzogchen instruction in the West, first in Italy, then in numerous other countries. He quickly became a respected spiritual authority among many practitioners, and has created centers for the study of Dzogchen worldwide. On 10 September 2018, the Italian government gave its highest award, Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, to him from President Sergio Mattarella. The Tibetan government in exile regarded him as having been “the foremost living Dzogchen” teacher at the time of his death in 2018.\n\nThis section details the origins and meaning of the title Chögyal and the name Namkhai Norbu (Tibetan: \"Chos-rGyal Nam-mkha’i Nor-bu\").\n\nChögyal is a title most commonly associated with the monarchy of Sikkim, now a state in far-northern India. However, Chögyal (or Chos-rGyal) is also a title conferred upon a special class of temporal and spiritual rulers of the Kingdom of Bhutan, who were recognized mindstream emanations of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the 17th Century Tibetan-born founder of Bhutan. Namkhai Norbu, recognized at the age of five as an emanation of Ngawang Namgyel, holds the title of Chögyal in this context.\n\n\"Namkhai\" (Tibetan) holds the semantic field of \"sky\", \"space\" and \"aether,\" and has the possessive case ending, thus it may be rendered into English as \"...of the sky\". \"Norbu\" (Tibetan) holds the semantic field of \"jewel\", \"crystal\", \"gem\", \"cintamani\". Therefore, Namkhai Norbu may be rendered in English as \"Jewel of the Sky\", \"Gem of the Aether\" or \"Crystal of Space\".\n\nNamkhai Norbu was a recognized tulku (also trulku), a reincarnate master. At birth two of Namkhai Norbu's uncles, the Dzogchen masters Palyul Karma Yangsid and Shechen Rabjam believed him to be the reincarnation of their master, Adzom Drugpa Rinpoche (1841–1934). When Namkhai Norbu was two years old, this was confirmed by a senior tulku of the Nyingma school.\n\nThen when he was five years old, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa and the Situ Rinpoche together recognized Namkhai Norbu as the mind emanation of the mindstream of another well known teacher, who was in turn the emanation of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the 17th Century Tibetan-born founder of Bhutan.\n\nAt a very young age, these recognitions conferred upon Namkhai Norbu a great deal of attention and prestige, as he himself remarks: \"As I grew up, I was thus given quite a few names and titles, many of which are very long and grand sounding. But I have never used them, because I have always preferred the name my parents gave me at birth.\"\n\nIn his early years Namkhai Norbu studied at the Derge Gonchen monastery. At the age of nine he entered a Sakya College where he studied Buddhist philosophy for many years with Khyenrab Chökyi Odzer. He also received numerous tantric and Dzogchen transmissions and teachings from many masters, including his paternal uncle Togden Ugyen Tendzin (who achieved the rainbow body), maternal uncle Khyentse Rinpoche Chökyi Wangchug, Drubwang Rinpoche Kunga Palden, Negyab Rinpoche, Drugse Gyurmed Dorje, Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö and Bo Gongkar Rinpoche. In 1951, he also received Chöd teachings from Ayu Khandro Dorje Paldrön (1838–1953), a woman who spent over fifty years in dark retreat and was a disciple of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo.\n\nNamkhai Norbu was invited to China in 1953 as a representative of the Tibetan monasteries. After visiting Chengdu and Chungching, he accepted the invitation to teach Tibetan language in Menyag. During this time he met Kangkar Rinpoche, from whom he received instructions on the Six Yogas of Naropa and other teachings.\n\nNamkhai Norbu met his root teacher Rigdzin Changchub Dorje in 1955 and stayed at his residence in Khamdogar for six months. From Changchub Dorje he received the authentic transmission of Dzogchen and realized the essence of the dharma (subsuming both Wylie: 'chos' & 'bon') as one state of knowledge beyond all limitations. This realization has remained a characteristic feature of his way of teaching throughout his life.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Namkhai Norbu made a pilgrimage to Tibet, India, and Nepal. Because of the turmoil and aftermath of the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, he could not return to Tibet from Sikkim, so he stayed in the erstwhile kingdom while working as an author and editor for the Chogyal government.\n\nAlready recognized as extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of Tibetan culture at the age of 22, he was invited to Italy by Professor Giuseppe Tucci to work at the ISMEO Institute in Rome for two years. In 1962, he took up a post in Naples at the Istituto Universitario Orientale, where he taught Tibetan language and literature until 1992. From the time of his residence in Italy, Namkhai Norbu focused his research mainly on the ancient history of Tibet, investigating thoroughly the native Bön tradition. His books include works on history, Tibetan medicine, astrology, Bön and folk traditions such as namkha. They have been highly appreciated by Tibetans as well as scholars throughout the world.\n\nIn 1971, Namkhai Norbu began to teach Yantra Yoga, an ancient form of Tibetan Yoga combining movement, breathing and visualization. A few years later, he started to give Dzogchen teachings to a small group of Italian students, with whom he founded the 'Dzogchen Community' (Wylie: rdzogs chen 'dus sde). At that time, Dzogchen was relatively unknown in the West.\n\nAs interest in his teachings grew, Rinpoche dedicated himself to spreading Dzogchen and establishing 'gars' (Tibetan), seats of the International Dzogchen Community, throughout the world. Today there are gars in Italy, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Australia, Romania, Russia, Spain, Ukraine and China. Apart from his spiritual activity, he founded the International Shang-Shung Institute to preserve the cultural traditions of Tibet, and ASIA, a nonprofit organization in Tibet mainly dedicated to serving the educational and medical needs of the Tibetan people.\n\n\nCDs and DVDs\n\n\n"}

He was not undefeated at two, however, having earlier finished second in the Railway Stakes behind a horse named Rock Of Gibraltar. Hawk Wing's subsequent victories in the National Stakes (in an all age course record time), and the Futurity Stakes led him to the position of favorite for the following year's 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby.\n\nIn the 2,000 Guineas, two distinct groups formed on either side of the straight track, with the faster ground on the far side. Hawk Wing was in the group on the stands side, while the group on the far side, containing Rock Of Gibraltar, was travelling slightly further ahead. Hawk Wing beat his own group, and was rapidly closing in on Rock Of Gibraltar but lost by a neck.\n\nHis next run was in the 2002 Epsom Derby, where his run in the Guineas was enough to give him the position of market favorite again. He ran second to stablemate High Chaparral. The pair were twelve lengths clear of a field including the winners of three major Derby trials. After the Derby, he subsequently dropped back to 10 furlongs and won the prestigious Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. He was beaten a short head by Grandera in a renewal of the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown, further prompting some in believing that he wasn't the most genuine of race horses. A runner-up finish behind Where Or When despite being the heavy favourite in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot and a disappointing Stateside trip to the Breeders' Cup Classic further dented his reputation.\n\nHe was kept in training at the age of four years. A field of six ran in the 2003 Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury, including: Where Or When, who had beaten Hawk Wing in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes; Olden Times, winner of the Group One Prix Jean Prat; Domedriver, who had inflicted Rock Of Gibraltar's first defeat in eight Group One races in the Breeders' Cup Mile; Reel Buddy (priced at 50-1 despite having been placed in the Group One Sussex Stakes - an indication of the quality of the field); and Celebration Mile winner Tillerman. Hawk Wing beat this Group One field by 11 lengths, with second place Where Or When eight lengths clear of Olden Times in third. Timeform rated him at 136, suggesting that this was the best performance in the world over a mile for nearly ten years.\n\nOn his only subsequent outing in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot Hawk Wing finished unplaced after suffering a knee ligament injury which ended his racing career.\n\nHe retired to Coolmore stud in Ireland. His first crop were 2yos of 2007 and included 11 winners as of the 18th August; his sons Let Us Prey and Feared In Flight have BHA Handicap marks of 98 and 97, respectively. In Australia, his Irish-bred sons Hawk Island (Wyong Cup, Parramatta Cup, and JRA Plate) and Stand To Gain (Sydney Cup) have won stakes races.\n\nAfter standing for a fee of €15,000 in 2008 Hawk Wing was sold to stand in Korea in a deal arranged by BBA Ireland Ltd. He covered an average of 80 mares a season in his first four years in Korea but demand for his services declined and he is recorded as covering only five mares since 2016.\n\n"}

() is a French high-performance luxury automobiles manufacturer and a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, with its head office and assembly plant in Molsheim, Alsace, France. Volkswagen purchased the Bugatti trademark in June 1998 and incorporated Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. in 1999.\n\nBugatti presented several concept cars between 1998 and 2000 before commencing development of its first production model, the Veyron 16.4, delivering the first Veyron to a customer in 2005.\n\nAt the urging of then-chairman Ferdinand Piëch, Volkswagen purchased the rights to produce cars under the Bugatti marque in June 1998. This followed the earlier Volkswagen purchases of the Lamborghini marque (by VW's Audi subsidiary), the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, United Kingdom, and the Bentley marque.\n\nOn 22 December 2000, Volkswagen officially incorporated Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., with former VW drivetrain chief Karl-Heinz Neumann as president. The company purchased the 1856 Château Saint Jean, formerly Ettore Bugatti's guest house in Dorlisheim, near Molsheim, and began refurbishing it to serve as the company's headquarters. The original factory was still in the hands of Snecma, who were unwilling to part with it. At the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2000, VW announced that they would instead build a new modern \"atelier\" (factory) next to and south of the Château. The \"atelier\" was officially inaugurated on 3 September 2005.\n\nBugatti Automobiles S.A.S. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen AG \n\nAfter the Veyron's discontinuation in 2014, the new Bugatti model was revealed to be the Chiron in 2016. With an 8-liter W16 engine delivering 1500 horsepower, an electronically limited top speed of 261 miles per hour, and a price of about €2,400,000, the Chiron attempts to vastly surpass the Veyron's performance.\n\nVolkswagen commissioned Italdesign's Giorgetto Giugiaro to design a series of concept cars to return the marque to prominence. The first example, the EB 118, was a two-door coupé and was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 1998. It was followed by the four-door EB 218 touring sedan, introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1999. Later that year, the 18/3 Chiron was shown at the IAA in Frankfurt.\n\nVolkswagen designed the final Bugatti concept, the EB 18/4 GT in house. Bugatti introduced the EB 18/4 at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show.\n\nAll of these early concepts featured a 18-cylinder engine. This was the first-ever W-configuration engine on a passenger vehicle, with three blocks of 6 cylinders each. It shared many components with Volkswagen's modular engine family.\n\nThe 16C Galibier was unveiled during Celebration of the Centenary of the Marque in Molsheim. The presentation was only for Bugatti customers. The car show in Molsheim showed the car in blue carbon fibre and aluminum parts. One year later Bugatti showed the world the 16C Galibier Concept at \"VW Group Night\" at the Geneva Auto Show in a new black and aluminum color combination.\n\nThe Galibier, a 1000 HP sedan, was first shown as a concept in 2010 and when they planned to put it into production in 2015, it would have cost about $1.4 million. It would use the same 16-cylinder 8.0-litre engine as the Veyron but instead of four turbos, the 16C Galibier would instead use two superchargers to deliver better torque. Production would require new facilities in Molsheim, France, to be refitted, which pushed back potential deliveries until 2015.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that the car will never be produced as they wish to focus on a Veyron replacement.\n\nIn the 1980s the Bugatti brand was brought back as Bugatti Automobili S.p.A. in Italy. The company produced the EB110 in the 1990s, which put Bugatti back on the modern super-car scene. The company was then bought by Volkswagen at the end of the 20th century.\n\nDevelopment of this vehicle began with the 1999 EB 18/4 \"Veyron\" concept car, which itself had a chassis based on that of the Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car. It was similar in design and appearance to the final Veyron production car. One major difference was the EB 18/4's use of a W18 engine with three banks of six cylinders. The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuss, and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen, rather than Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign, who had handled the three prior Bugatti concepts.\n\nThe then – Volkswagen Group chairman Ferdinand Piëch announced the Veyron at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show. It was promised to be the fastest, most powerful and most expensive car in history. Instead of the W18, it would use a VR6/WR8-style W16 engine. First seen in the 1999 Bentley Hunaudières concept car, the W16 would have four turbochargers and produce a quoted (metric) 1001 horsepower (see engine section for details on the power output). Top speed was promised at 407 km/h (253 mph), and the price was announced at €1 million.\n\nDevelopment continued throughout 2001 and the EB 16/4 Veyron was promoted to \"advanced concept\" status. In late 2001, Bugatti announced that the car, officially called the \"Bugatti Veyron 16.4\", would go into production in 2003.\n\nPiëch retired that year as chairman of the Volkswagen Group and was replaced by Bernd Pischetsrieder. The new chairman promptly sent the Veyron back to the drawing board for major revisions. Neumann was replaced as Bugatti president by Thomas Bscher in December 2003, and substantial modifications were made to the Veyron under the guidance of a former VW engineer, Bugatti Engineering chief Wolfgang Schreiber.\n\nThe Veyron costs €1,100,000 (net price without taxes); prices vary by exchange rates and local taxes (like value added taxes). Prices for the UK or the US are over £880,000, or around $1,400,000. It was noted in an April issue of \"Live\" magazine (weekly men's magazine with \"The Sunday Times\") that customers are free to order additional extras which can push the price up by the cost of a Rolls Royce Phantom. During an episode of \"Top Gear\", the car was compared to the Concorde as a feat of technology.\n\nAt the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti premiered the Bugatti Chiron as a successor to the Veyron. The pricing is set at 2.4 million euros. It is powered by a quad-turbocharged W16 engine with a peak power output of at 6,700 rpm and of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm. It can accelerate from in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer and has an electronically limited top speed of ( without top speed key) for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as the manufacturer concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving. The base price is ( at the August 2016 exchange rate), and buyers were required to place a ( at the August 2016 exchange rate) deposit. Production is limited to 500 units. Unlike the Veyron, the Chiron is expected to make a profit.\n\nAt the exclusive automotive event “The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering“ in Monterey, California, Bugatti premiered its latest model as a world premiere. The Divo takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car is 8.0 seconds quicker than the Chiron around the Nardò test track according to the manufacturer and generates of downforce at top speed, more than the Chiron. The top speed is, however, reduced to , owing to the extra drag produced by the aerodynamic elements and due to excessive pressure on the tyres resulting from a lower ride height. Power output is unchanged from the Chiron, with at 6700 rpm and of torque from 2000 to 6000 rpm. The production of the Divo is limited to 40 units and the car will be built alongside the Chiron at the Bugatti factory. The base price for the Divo was €5 million (US$5.8 million), around twice the price of what the standard Chiron cost.\n\nThe La Voiture Noire (\"The Black Car\") was a special edition car built and sold by Bugatti in 2019. It was presented at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. The car pays homage to the legendary 'missing' Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic of Jean Bugatti. Only 1 of these cars were built and sold for a price of $12.5 million; making it the most expensive new car ever sold.\n\nThe Centodieci was unveiled by Bugatti in August 2019 and was made as a tribute to the EB110. Only 10 will be made and will be priced at 8 million euros each.\n\n\n\n"}

The ban expired on 25 December 2006, but a byelaw meant that Don remained ineligible for Olympic selection. On Friday, 25 May 2007, Don was cleared by the British Olympic Association for selection for future Olympic Games after appealing against a ban for missing doping tests.

Ōryōki also refers to a meditative form of eating using these utensils that originated in Japan and emphasizes mindfulness awareness practice by abiding to a strict order of precise movements.\n\nThe term \"ōryōki\" is mostly used in the sect of Zen Buddhism. In the and sects, the utensils are called \"jihatsu\", which is written as 持鉢 according to rinzai-shū and 自鉢 according to ōbaku-shū. \"Jihatsu\" is also used to refer to the bowls alone \n\nThe bowls usually made of lacquered wood, and utensils all bundled in a cloth. The largest bowl, sometimes called the Buddha Bowl or \"zuhatsu\", symbolizes Buddha's head and his wisdom. The other bowls are progressively smaller. In describing the form of ōryōki used at John Daido Loori's Zen Mountain Monastery, author Jack Maguire wrote\n\nThis is the formal style of serving and eating meals practiced in Zen temples.\n\nBuddhist tradition states that after Huineng received the monk's robe and bowl as evidence of his having received Dharma transmission, the bowl itself was considered a symbol of transmission from teacher to student.\n\nŌryōki have evolved in Buddhist monasteries in China and Japan over many years and are part of the Buddhist tradition that has now been transmitted to the West. Both monks and laypeople use ōryōki to eat formal meals in Zen monasteries and places of practice. A lineage was also transmitted from Kobun Chino Roshi to the Tibetan Buddhist sangha of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and is now practiced at all Shambhala retreat centers.\n\nZen teachers say that taking meals with ōryōki cultivates gratitude, mindfulness, and better understanding of self. (In this regard, it is not unlike zazen.) The intricacies of the form may require the practitioner to pay great attention to detail.\n\nAccording to Shohaku Okumura:\nIn Japanese, three Sino-Japanese characters comprise the word ōryōki:\n\n\n"}

Based in Old Deer Park, Richmond-upon-Thames, London Welsh RFC played in the English Premiership in the 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons, after gaining promotion from the RFU Championship in the 2012 and 2014 play-off final. The club returned to Old Deer Park in 2015 after three seasons at the Kassam Stadium, Oxford.\n\nThe club went into liquidation in December 2016 under Chairman Bleddyn Phillips, and was given a temporary licence to complete two fixtures in the Championship. On 24 January 2017 it was announced that London Welsh had been removed from the RFU Championship and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\" and the club were dissolved. The remnants of the defunct club were amalgamated into their amateur set up.\n\nDuring professionalism, London Welsh's first-XV squad were fully professional, and they were complemented with the London Welsh Amateurs, Druids and Occies. Following the changes at the club in the 2016/17 season the club operates the 1st XV and Druids 2nd XV that form the performance playing squad, the Occies 3rd XV and the Under 23s Griffins player pathway.\n\nLondon Welsh has one of the longest-standing women's sides – LWWRFC – which celebrated thirty years of women's rugby at the club in the 2015–16 season. While still being amateur, the club has succeeded both in XVs in the winter and 7s during the summer as well as players representing England at the regional level and on the Wales national touch team. There is also a mini and junior section.\n\nLondon Welsh was formed in 1885 by and for London's Welsh community, and has played senior-level rugby since then. Its name in Welsh, is \"Clwb Rygbi Cymry Llundain\".\n\nOver the years the club has contributed 177 players to the Wales national team and 43 players to the British and Irish Lions. Seven London Welsh players were selected for the 1971 tour to New Zealand (a Lions record which remains unbroken to this day): captain John Dawes (now London Welsh president), JPR Williams, Gerald Davies, Mervyn Davies, John Taylor (now Managing Director and ITV commentator), Mike Roberts and Geoff Evans.\n\nLondon Welsh enjoyed great success in the late 1960s. John Dawes was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards. One 1968-69 performance was described by journalist John Reason as \"one of the most brilliant exhibitions of club football it has been my privilege to see,\" and by journalist Terry O'Connor as \"the finest display by a club team I can remember', further describing London Welsh 'switching attacks with speed and handling skill.' \n\nIn December 2006, London Welsh revealed their ambition to leave the English league and become the fifth Welsh team in the Celtic League. The club later appeared to go back on this report, claiming they had been misquoted and said this would only be considered if the English Premiership decided to prohibit promotion/relegation, but confirmed their hopes of ground-sharing with Brentford FC either at their current stadium Griffin Park or a new 20,000 seat ground to be built at Lionel Road, near Kew Bridge.\n\nIn June 2009, the club went into administration shortly after turning professional. They were bought from the receivers in July 2009 by Saudex Global, owned by Neil Hollinshead, and allowed to continue in The Championship, albeit with a five-point deduction. According to the BBC in March 2011, court documents show that Hollinshead is \"alleged to have submitted forged documents and fake bank account details in order to continue his control of London Welsh and that he repeatedly lied to ensure that ownership of London Welsh was transferred over to him.\" The former shareholders of London Welsh RFC rescinded the 2009 agreement, by which they sold the shares of the club to Hollinshead, and had regained control by January 2010.\n\nThe 2010–11 season was the club's 125th anniversary and to kick off the celebrations they held a military tattoo on the evening of Wednesday 25 August at Old Deer Park with the Band and Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards, plus the London Welsh Rugby Club Choir.\n\nOn 1 June 2012, it was revealed that Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish had approached senior figures at the club about a possible ground-share at Selhurst Park, as the club's plans to play their matches at Kassam Stadium in Oxford were deemed unsuitable by the RFU, after securing promotion to the English Premiership. However a legal appeal by the club against the RFU's actions was upheld on 28 June 2012, after the appeal panel ruled that the criteria were in breach of EU and UK competition laws. Promotion was ultimately secured when it was announced that Newcastle Falcons, the club facing relegation from the Premiership, would not appeal against the ruling. A move to the Kassam Stadium was then confirmed for the 2012–13 season.\n\nIn 2013 London Welsh caused controversy by fielding an ineligible player (Tyson Keats) in nine league matches during the season, eventually receiving a 5-point deduction and £10,000 fine.\n\nOn 14 April 2013, London Welsh were relegated from the English Premiership in their first season (pending the winners of the RFU Championship meeting the Premiership entry requirements) after a 14–31 defeat at home to Northampton Saints. Newcastle Falcons were eligible for promotion and therefore confirmed Welsh's relegation.\n\nOn 4 June 2014, London Welsh won promotion to the English Premiership again, defeating Bristol Rugby 27–8 at home and 21–20 away, 48–28 on aggregate.\nHowever, the club endured a difficult season back in the English top flight, and suffered defeat in all of their 22 league fixtures of the regular season, claiming only 1 bonus point throughout the entire campaign. The team therefore finished bottom and was relegated to the RFU Championship for the 2015–16 season. The team was also defeated in every single European Challenge Cup game, as well as every single Anglo-Welsh cup game. As a result, they became the first top-flight English side for over 10 years to suffer defeat in every single competitive match over a season.\n\nThe club left Oxford and returned to Old Deer Park at the end of the 2014–15 season. Following the return the club, led by Head Coach Rowland Phillips, went on to win the British and Irish Cup, beating Yorkshire Carnegie 10–33. Phillips then moved on to take up a coaching role with the Welsh Rugby Union. He was succeeded by forwards coach James Buckland who took the role of Head Coach, assisted by Sonny Parker and Richard Tonkin.\n\nHMRC petitioned the High Court to wind up the club in September 2016 due to unresolved debts. The debts were paid and the petition was dismissed by the High Court. HMRC returned to court with a second winding-up petition in October 2016 and the insolvency court granted a stay of two weeks to arrange refinancing. After failing to pay their debts, the club went into voluntary liquidation on 23 December 2016. The club ceased to be a member of the RFU at that point and the liquidator stated that London Welsh would not be fulfilling the club's fixtures in the league. A separate entity, \"Rugby 1885 Limited\", was created on 21 December 2016. The club were deducted 20 points from the Championship dropping them from 5th to 12th. Rugby 1885 Limited were granted a temporary licence to complete London Welsh's two fixtures until a further decision on their future in the Championship. When the temporary licence expired on 17 January 2017, the RFU Board met and extended a deadline to allow the new entity to show it could meet RFU regulations. After a further deadline was not met, on 24 January 2017 it was announced by the RFU that London Welsh had been removed from the Championship and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\".\n\nIn 2017 London Welsh decided not to re-form a new club but to focus on its amateur set-up, with the 1st XV playing in the Herts/Middlesex 1 division under the name London Welsh, and its 3 other teams, the London Welsh Druids, London Welsh Occies and London Welsh Women, playing lower down the pyramid system. London Welsh announced a five-year plan in May 2017 to get the club back into the national leagues by being promoted 4 times, bringing in ex-players Sonny Parker as Director of Rugby and Cai Griffiths as Head Coach, and Pete Lowe as Team Manager. In 2018 Sonny Parker left, and Tom May and Will Taylor were recruited as coaches.

It was compiled by Huang Shang (黃裳) on the commission of Emperor Huizong during the Song Dynasty. Huang's compendium became the first volume of the manual. During the writing process, Huang enriched himself with Taoist knowledge and the principles of inner energy and \"qi\". When combined with Huang's intelligence, the knowledge he acquired during the compilation turned him into a formidable martial artist.\n\nSoon after, the emperor appointed Huang to lead an army to eradicate the Ming Cult, a sect of Persian origin that had been involved in many anti-government activities. The Song army engaged the cult in a fierce battle but failed to capture the enemy's fortress. Huang fought with the cult's best fighters one-on-one and slew every single one of them until he was forced to retreat due to exhaustion. In retaliation, the Ming Cult dispatched the best of its surviving warriors to kill Huang's family.\n\nHuang was enraged and he vowed to destroy the cult. For the next four decades, Huang dedicated himself to experimenting with new techniques to counter those of the Ming Cult's martial arts. As many of the cult's members were affiliated to other sects, Huang had to develop new techniques that were capable of countering the other sects' martial arts as well.\n\nHuang succeeded in accomplishing his herculean task but his enemies had died during those four decades. Huang wrote the second volume of the manual, detailing his experiences and the new techniques he had developed and innovated during his 40 years of research. Earlier edition of \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\" has the creator being Bodhidharma.\n\nThe manual was lost for several years after Huang Shang's death. When it reappeared in the \"jianghu\", it induced bloodshed as martial artists competed fiercely with each other to seize possession of the anthology of martial arts. Numerous lives were lost due to the ensuing chaos caused by the obsession with the book. To prevent further spilling of blood, martial artists decided to stage a martial arts contest on Mount Hua to determine who would be the manual's rightful owner. The Five Greats (\"Central Divine\" Wang Chongyang, \"Eastern Heretic\" Huang Yaoshi, \"Western Venom\" Ouyang Feng, \"Northern Beggar\" Hong Qigong and \"Southern Emperor\" Duan Zhixing) gathered on Mount Hua and agreed that the champion of the contest would gain sole possession of the manual.\n\nAfter an intense competition that lasted seven days, Wang Chongyang emerged as overall champion and won the manual for himself. Wang incorporated some of the manual's underlying principles into the martial arts of his Quanzhen Sect, most notably the Big Dipper Formation. He left a part of the manual that held the key to defeating the skills of the Ancient Tomb Sect in the tomb of his lover and rival Lin Chaoying.\n\nBefore his death, Wang passed the manual to his junior Zhou Botong, warning the latter not to let the manual fall into wrong hands. Ouyang Feng had previously attempted to seize the manual during Wang's funeral after the latter's apparent death. However, Wang had faked his own death and he caught Ouyang completely by surprise. Ouyang was defeated and he fled. Wang also laid down a regulation that no member of Quanzhen is permitted to learn and use any of the skills in the manual.\n\nAfter Wang Chongyang's death, Zhou Botong travelled to Peach Blossom Island, where Huang Yaoshi lives, to warn Huang not to think about stealing the manual. Huang tricked Zhou into allowing his wife Feng Heng to have a glance at the manual. Feng had eidetic memory and she memorised the text of the second volume after browsing through it once. She lied to Zhou that the manual was worthless, by reciting the text and claiming that it came from a book of childish rites she had read before. Zhou believed her and destroyed the book in anger. After Zhou Botong left, Feng Heng wrote a copy of the manual from memory for her husband.\n\nTwo years later, Huang's disciples Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng decided to elope as they fear that their teacher might oppose their relationship. They stole Huang's copy of the manual and fled from Peach Blossom Island. Huang was furious when he found out and he broke the legs of his other four students in anger and banished them from his island. Feng re-wrote the second volume of the manual from memory for her husband fearing that she would forget the manual and miss out on certain parts, which Huang would not be glad with as Huang was a martial arts maniac. However, tragedy struck as Feng rushed days and nights to finish the manual. It was to exhausting for her and after finishing the manual and giving birth, she died. Huang Yaoshi was filled with grief and he vowed to kill anyone who dared to learn anything from the book that cost the life of his beloved wife.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Botong realised that he had been fooled by Huang Yaoshi and he returned to Peach Blossom Island to confront Huang. He kept pestering and harassing Huang to hand the book to him. Huang was unable to defeat Zhou and could only imprison the latter on his island by sealing off all exit routes using a formation, a formation created by Huang using peach blossom and his knowledge of the Bagua and five elements. As for Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng, they started practising the skills in the manual but had interpreted wrongly the underlying principles and mastered an unorthodox version of the skill, 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' (九陰白骨爪). The manual read that the fingers/claw of the person would sink into the fatal points of the enemy, but they misinterpreted thinking the way to use this skill was to require human sacrifices during practice and hence instills fear in many martial artists by mere mention of its name. The original interpretation was to target the fatal points of the person, such as, by piercing the user's finger into the skull of the enemy and thus they do not truly master the skill. Apart from that, the couple also learned the 'Heart Shattering Palm' (摧心掌) and Mei mastered the 'White Boa Whip Skill' (白蟒鞭法). Chen and Mei became known as the \"Twin Killers in the Dark Wind\" for using those skills to commit heinous crimes and terrorize the \"jianghu\". In the process of learning these skills they did not have sufficient inner energy and hence rushed the process of cultivating a strong inner energy by eating arsenic and forcing it out of their body. Arsenic was the most commonly known, strongest poison in ancient Chinese.\n\nThe couple settled in Mongolia to avoid pursuit from their enemies in China. They met Guo Jing and the \"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\" and engaged in a fierce battle. Chen was stabbed and killed by Guo for underestimating Guo as a child, while Mei was blinded by Ke Zhen'e's poison darts, but she managed to flee with her husband's dead body. As Chen had tattooed the text of the manual on his chest, Mei skins her dead husband and takes the grisly text with her. She later meets Yang Kang, who offers her shelter in an underground room in his house, and she teaches him the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' in return.\n\nYears later Mei Chaofeng encounters Guo Jing and the \"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\" again at Guiyun Manor near Lake Tai and they engage in battle. Zhu Cong being a master at this, pickpockets Mei when he dusts her clothes after the fight and obtains the human skin copy of the manual and leaves it in Guo's possession.\n\nWhen Guo goes to Peach Blossom Island to seek Huang Rong's hand-in-marriage, he meets Zhou Botong there and they become sworn brothers even when Zhou was already past his prime age and Guo was no more than 20. Zhou still has with him a copy of the original first volume of the manual and he shares it with Guo as he was a martial arts maniac if could not understand the art he would pester anyone for it since Wang forbade his sect to learn it Zhou was also forbidden to learn he shared it with Guo as he found a suitable candidate to practise the skill and show it to him without him violating his senior wish. The first volume and the human skin copy of the second volume are then recompiled and imprinted in their memories.\n\nGuo incorporates parts of the manual's skills into his own repertoire of martial arts and becomes stronger. The power of his 'Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms' is enhanced after the \"Nine Yin Manual\"'s skills worked wonders by increasing his inner energy. His future spouse Huang Rong also benefits from the book. They later pass their knowledge of the manual to Yideng and their teacher Hong Qigong to help them recover from their internal injuries.\n\nMany decades later, after realising that Xiangyang (and the Song Dynasty) will eventually fall to Mongol invaders, Guo writes a copy of the \"Nine Yin Manual\" from memory and hides it inside the blade of the Heaven Reliant Sword (the latest edition of the third novel \"The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\" states that the scroll is hidden on Peach Blossom Island). He gives this sword to his younger daughter Guo Xiang, who will become the founder of the Emei Sect in the third novel.\n\nOuyang Feng forces Guo Jing to produce a copy of the manual for him in his bid to become the most powerful fighter in the \"jianghu\". Huang helps Guo write a fake copy of the book, with some changes to the text that only a really seasoned martial artist with the sense of contentment can detect. Some numbers were changed and verses were written in reverse order.\n\nWhen Huang Rong is taken hostage by Ouyang Feng later, he forces her to translate the last few verses in his copy obtained from Guo. Huang subtly changes the translated text and causes further complications. The result of all those \"edits\", ironically, increases Ouyang's powers but also causes him to become insane.\n\nYears before Zhou found the \"Nine Yin Manual\", Chang Yuchun of the Ming Cult was wounded by a monk working for the Yuan government, who used the 'Heart Shattering Palm' on him. Chang's injury was so serious that he only managed to live until the age of 39.\n\nGuo Xiang founds the Emei Sect and she is the only person who knows the secret in the Heaven Reliant Sword. The mystery is only passed down from the sect's leader to her successor. A century later, Zhou Zhiruo succeeds Miejue as leader of Emei and she is tasked with retrieving the hidden scrolls in the sword. Zhou breaks the sword by clashing it against the Dragon Slaying Saber and obtains the \"Nine Yin Manual\" hidden in the sword's blade. She follows the shortcuts inscribed on the manual in her practice and masters the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw', 'Heart Shattering Palm', and 'White Boa Whip Skill', just like Mei Chaofeng had done before her. As Huang had the time to spend to think of the fastest way to learn the skill without the prospects of danger, Zhou trains to learn the same techniques in a safer and less poisonous way. Zhou also teaches the Wudang Sect's renegade Song Qingshu the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw'.\n\nZhou encounters the Yellow Dress Maiden, a descendant of the Condor Hero Couple (Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü), while wreaking havoc in the \"jianghu\" after Zhang Wuji betrayed her love. The Maiden uses an orthodox version of the skills in the \"Nine Yin Manual\" against Zhou and defeated her easily. Later when Zhou is injured by the Xuanming Elders' 'Xuanming Divine Palm' (玄明神掌), Zhang Wuji uses his 'Nine Yang Divine Skill' to heal her but it negates her 'Nine Yin Inner Energy'.\n"}

{"id": "1877407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877407", "title": "Onchocerca volvulus", "text": "Onchocerca volvulus\n\nOnchocerca volvulus is a nematode that causes onchocerciasis (river blindness), and is the second-leading cause of blindness worldwide after trachoma. It is one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases listed by the World Health Organization, with elimination from certain countries expected by 2020.\n\nJohn O’Neill, an Irish surgeon, first described \"Onchocerca volvulus\" in 1874, when he found it to be the causative agent of ‘craw-craw’, a skin disease found in West Africa. A Guatemalan doctor, Rodolfo Robles, first linked it to visual impairment in 1917.\n\n\"O. volvulus\" is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, and humans are the only known definitive host. It is spread from person to person via female biting blackflies of the genus \"Simulium\".\n\n\"O. volvulus\" parasites obtain nutrients from the human host by ingesting blood or by diffusion through their cuticle. They may be able to trigger blood-vessel formation because dense vascular networks are often found surrounding the worms. \nThey are distinguished from other human-infecting filarial nematodes by the presence of deep transverse striations.\n\nIt is a dioecious species, containing distinct males and females, which form nodules under the skin in humans. Mature female worms permanently reside in these fibrous nodules, while male worms are free to move around the subcutaneous tissue. The males are smaller than females, with male worms measuring 23 mm in length compared to 230–700 mm in females.\n\nThe release of oocytes (eggs) in female worms does not depend upon the presence of a male worm, although they may attract male worms using unidentified pheromones. The first larval stage, microfilariae, are 300 μm in length and unsheathed, meaning when they mature into microfilariae, they exit from the envelope of the egg.\n\nThe average adult worm lifespan is 15 years, and mature females can produce between 500 and 1,500 microfilariae per day. The normal microfilarial lifespan is 1.0 to 1.5 years; however, their presence in the bloodstream causes little to no immune response until death or degradation of the microfilariae or adult worms.\n\n\n\n\"O. volvulus\" causes onchocerciasis, which causes severe itching. Long-term infection can cause keratitis, an inflammation of the cornea in the eye, and ultimately leads to blindness. Symptoms are caused by the microfilariae and the immune response to infection, rather than the adults themselves. The most effective treatment involves using ivermectin, although resistance has been reported as developing to this drug. Ivermectin prevents female worms from releasing microfilariae for several months, thus relieving symptoms and temporarily preventing transmission. However, this does not kill adult worms, so it must be taken once annually as long as adult worms are present.\n\n\"O. volvulus\" has been proposed as the causative agent of nodding syndrome, a condition that affects children aged 5 to 15 and is currently only observed in South Sudan, Tanzania, and northern Uganda. Although the cause of the disease is unknown, \"O. volvulus\" is being increasingly studied as a possible cause due to its ubiquity in areas where the disease is found.\n\nAn estimated 187 million people are at risk of \"O. volvulus\" infection, with 17–25 million people infected and 0.8 million showing some impairment of vision. \"O. volvulus\" has not directly caused a single death, but has cost 1.1 million disability adjusted life years, which measure the number of years of healthy life lost due to a specific disease and show the burden of a disease.\n\n\"Simulium\" blackfly adults require moving water to breed and eggs remain in water until they exit from the pupa and enter the adult stage of their lifecycle. Due to this restriction, \"O. volvulus\" is only found around streams or rivers. Artificial water systems, such as hydroelectric power plants, built in Africa, provide ideal conditions all year for blackfly development and make controlling its spread difficult.\n\nAbout 99% of cases of onchocerciasis are found in 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, although areas of limited transmission occur in Brazil, Venezuela, and Yemen. The disease is thought to have been imported into Latin America through the slave trade. Onchocerciasis was eliminated from Colombia in 2013, Ecuador in 2014, Mexico in 2015, and Guatemala in 2016 due to control programs that used mass drug administration with ivermectin.\n\nThe total genome size of \"O. volvulus\" is 1.5x10 BP and contains around 4,000 genes, with genes for collagen and cuticular proteins being highly expressed in the mature adults. \"O. volvulus\" has four chromosome pairs, which include a single pair of sex chromosomes. A large X sex chromosome and a smaller Y sex chromosome determine male worms, while two X chromosomes determine female worms.\n\nOne of the three nonsex chromosomes is thought to have formed by a fusion event between two smaller chromosomes.\n\n\"O. volvulus\" has low genetic variation between individuals. This suggests a population bottleneck occurred in the past that caused a rapid decrease in the population size. It also shows high haplotype diversity, which is a measure of how unique a group of linked genes is. This pattern of low genetic variation and high haplotype diversity suggests fast population expansion after a bottleneck and has led to the theory that a host shift event from cattle allowed \"O. volvulus\" to infect humans. This is also supported by genetic data that place \"O. ochengi\" (a cattle-infecting strain) as the sister group to \"O. volvulus\".\n\nAdult worms are found in nodules and are hidden from most components of the human immune system. Microfilariae are more vulnerable to attack by immune cells because they exit nodules to complete their lifecycle. \"O. volvulus\" can be detected by the immune system through the release of soluble antigens and antigens found on the surface of microfilariae and infective J juveniles. These antigens allow the immune system to detect the presence of a foreign organism in the body and trigger an immune response to clear infection.\n\nThe immune response involves raising antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgE type) that can react with soluble antigens released by \"Onchocerca volvulus\". Opsonising antibodies that tag cells for destruction are also found against the infective J stage and microfilariae, but there is not enough evidence at the moment to say whether this is protective.\n\nThe antigens of \"O. volvulus\" are highly complex and show cross-reactivity with several other filarial worms. Little evidence indicates that antibodies made are specific to \"O. volvulus\". However, after the age of 40, the number of parasites carried (the intensity of infection) decreases, suggesting that over time, some sort of protective immune response develops.\n\nMicrofilariae can also modulate the immune system to avoid destruction. The complement system is used to enhance the effect of antibodies and phagocytic cells, which engulf and destroy other cells. Microfilariae block this pathway by cleaving C3b—an important protein in this process—to form iC3b. iC3b cannot go on to activate the next step in the pathway and allows microfilariae to remain in the body with little to no attack by the immune system.\n\n\"O. volvulus\", along with most filarial nematodes, share an endosymbiotic relationship with the bacterium \"Wolbachia\". In the absence of \"Wolbachia\", larval development of \"O. volvulus\" is disrupted or ceased. These bacteria have been proposed to enhance the symptoms and severity of onchocerciasis by triggering inflammatory responses in the host.\n"}
{"id": "1877408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877408", "title": "Hugh Palliser", "text": "Hugh Palliser\n\nAdmiral Sir Hugh Palliser, 1st Baronet (26 February 1723 – 19 March 1796) was a Royal Navy officer. As captain of the 60-gun HMS \"Eagle\" he engaged and defeated the French 50-gun \"Duc d'Aquitain\" off Ushant in May 1757 during the Seven Years' War. He went on to serve as Commodore Governor of Newfoundland, then Controller of the Navy and then First Naval Lord. During the American Revolutionary War he came into a famous dispute with Augustus Keppel over his conduct as third-in-command of the Channel Fleet at the inconclusive Battle of Ushant in July 1778; the dispute led to Palliser being court-martialled, although he was subsequently acquitted. In retirement Palliser became Governor of Greenwich Hospital.\nPalliser was the only son of Hugh Palliser and Mary Robinson and was born at Kirk Deighton, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now in North Yorkshire). The family had estates in Yorkshire and Ireland. His parents died when he was still young, so he and his sisters were (probably) raised by relatives on his mother's side. He entered the navy in 1735 as a midshipman on HMS \"Aldborough\" commanded by his uncle Nicholas Robinson. He followed his uncle to HMS \"Kennington\" in 1737, and then to HMS \"Tiger\" and HMS \"Essex\".\nPalliser passed his lieutenant's examination on 12 May 1741 and was promoted to the rank on 18 September 1741. He continued to serve aboard \"Essex\", at first under Robinson, and after he was superseded, under Captain Richard Norris, the son of Sir John Norris. In February 1746 he was placed in command of HMS \"Weazel\". On 25 November 1746 he was appointed post-captain in HMS \"Captain\", sailing for the West Indies with the broad pennant of Commodore Edward Legge. Legge died on 19 September 1747, and Palliser transferred to HMS \"Sutherland\". Six months later an accidental fire in that ship's arms chest wounded Palliser; a ball entered his back and exited his groin; another ball struck his right hip; a third ball struck his left shoulder. Two other men were killed in the explosion. Palliser returned to England to recover, but remained lame in his left leg, and suffered perpetual and sometimes excruciating pain to which his death was eventually attributed.\nHe returned to active service in December 1748 and was appointed to command the frigate , sailing her to the East Indies to bring news of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which concluded Britain's role in the War of the Austrian Succession. Palliser was then part of Edward Boscawen's squadron on the Coromandel coast from July 1749, returning to Britain to pay off \"Sheerness\" in April 1750. As an alternative to half-pay he took up appointment as captain of , the guardship at Chatham. Shortly afterwards he was moved to the much smaller 20-gun , A difficulty arose when Scottish authorities accused a sailor from \"Seahorse\" of circulating a forged letter of indenture, in order to receive greater pay. The sailor took refuge aboard the ship, and Palliser refused to hand him over. Palliser was thereupon arrested in the sailor's place and held for several days in the Tolbooth Jail in Edinburgh. He was eventually released by order of the Scottish Lords of Session, who invoked their authority to supersede that of the judge of the vice-admiralty court in Edinburgh who had sought to commit Palliser for trial.\nIn early 1753 he was appointed captain of the 50-gun , but soon afterwards returned to command a convoy comprising \"Seahorse\" and , with orders to protect transports being used to move two British Army regiments to the Colonies immediately prior to what would become the Seven Years' War against France. Palliser sailed in January 1755, directing the convoy in a long southern arc across the Atlantic, as far as the Tropic of Cancer. This represented a substantial deviation from the traditional and more direct easterly route, but enabled the convoy to travel in calmer weather and avoid the risk of losing transports to storms. The unorthodox navigation won Palliser some praise from British authorities.\n\nThe ongoing friction between Britain and France ignited into open warfare in 1755. In October of that year Palliser was placed in command of the 60-gun HMS \"Eagle\". That ship engaged and defeated the French 50-gun \"Duc d'Aquitain\" off Ushant on 30 May 1757. After that battle \"Eagle\" returned to port for repairs, and Palliser moved to command of the 74-gun HMS \"Shrewsbury\", part of the Channel Fleet under George Anson.\nIn that ship in July 1758 he grounded and captured several French ships near Brest. In 1759 Palliser participated in the successful British capture of Quebec City, commanding the seamen who landed and took possession of Lower Town. In 1760 Palliser was sent to the Mediterranean Sea to chase a small French squadron which had slipped out of the port at Toulon. He bottled the French boats up at several ports in Turkey. In 1861 Palliser captured a Danish merchant ship from a small convoy off Sardinia, escorted by the Dano-Norwegian ship of the line HDMS \"Grønland\", in a shrewd operation, where no shots were fired. It was a precarious operation, as Denmark-Norway was neutral in the war, but Palliser had intelligence information informing him that the Danish ships were in fact shipping goods from the Levant to Marseilles for French merchants, a practice, which ended after the incident.\nIn 1762 Palliser commanded a four-ship armada dispatched to retake St. John's, Newfoundland, but the area was already in British control when he arrived following the Battle of Signal Hill.\n\nIn 1764 Palliser was named Governor and Commander-in-Chief at Newfoundland. He had under his command the 50-gun , and several frigates. His forces encountered a similar French force which was ostensibly regulating their remaining fishing grounds in the area, but Palliser perceived that they had altered their maps to show they controlled more area than had been agreed upon in the negotiations which ended the conflict in this area. The French minister in London used this clash to complain to the British government against Palliser, but he was able to produce sufficient maps and supporting material to convince his superiors of his correct actions.\nPalliser actively supported the fisheries as a source of trained seamen for the Royal Navy. As such he took active steps to enforce the provisions of Treaty of Paris (1763) restricting French access to their specific fishing rights. He also sought to restrict further settlement of Newfoundland, so to encourage the British-based industry.\nPalliser remained Governor of Newfoundland until 1768. In 1770 Commodore Palliser was appointed Comptroller of the Navy, and in that same year was elected an elder brother of the Trinity House, which oversees British lighthouses and provides general expertise to the government on naval matters.\nIn 1773 Palliser was made Baronet. In 1774 he was elected to Parliament for the Borough of Scarborough. On 31 March 1775 he achieved flag rank when promoted to rear-admiral. Under the Earl of Sandwich he joined the Board of Admiralty as First Naval Lord in April 1775 and received the sinecure of Lieutenant-General of Marines. Palliser was promoted to vice-admiral on 29 January 1778. He stood down from the Admiralty Board in September 1779.\n\nWith his involvement in fisheries and seamen training, in 1775 Palliser initiated legislation to encourage and regulate ship fisheries in Newfoundland. The act (15 Geo. 3 c.31) is commonly known as \"Palliser’s Act\" (15 Geo. 3 c.31), but short-titled Newfoundland Fisheries Act 1775; its long title is \"An act for the encouragement of the Fisheries carried on, from Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions in Europe, and for securing the return of the fishermen, sailors, and others employed in the said fisheries, to the ports thereof, at the end of the fishing season\".\nHistorian Sean Cadigan, author of \"Hope and Deception in Conception Bay\" (1995), has since linked \"Palliser's Act\" with the high-valuation of women's labour in 18th Century Newfoundland. Given that \"Palliser's Act\" required producers to pre-pay their labourers for the fishing season, producers developed little incentive to hire outside of their families: hired labour was high risk because pre-paid wages reduced producers' margin for gain (or loss). As such, \"Palliser's Act\" inspired the merger of household labour with the market, making women's work essential to the economic success of the colony.\n\nIn 1778 Palliser was appointed to the Channel Fleet under Admiral Augustus Keppel. On 27 July 1778 in the First Battle of Ushant, the Channel Fleet fought an inconclusive battle with the French fleet. The battle's outcome led to personal acrimony between Palliser and Keppel, resulted in their individual courts martial and increased divisiveness in the Navy. Palliser was forced to resign from Parliament and his other posts.\nThe July 1778 Battle of Ushant came about when the British fleet found that it had become located between the French ships and their home ports. Seeing the sudden advantage, Keppel ordered that a battle line be formed and an attack made. Palliser's ship was badly damaged in the ensuing fray, and when Keppel hoisted the signal to reform the battle line, Palliser's division was some distance away, so a frigate was dispatched to give the instruction. Due to the battle damage, Palliser's division was unable to comply until later in the evening, when it was too late to continue the battle, and the French withdrew to Brest. Both sides later claimed victory, and Keppel issued a dispatch which commended all his officers for their conduct in the action.\nPalliser heard rumours that Keppel had intimated in private conversations that Palliser's absence had been the cause of the inconclusive outcome, so Palliser wrote a paper defending his actions. An anonymous letter to a London newspaper accused Palliser of disobedience in the battle, and he called on Keppel to refute the allegation. When no public refutation was forthcoming, Palliser demanded that a court martial be held to try Keppel on charges of \"misconduct and neglect of duty\" (which carried a death sentence if proved). Keppel's court martial was held at Portsmouth in January 1779, and he was acquitted after 27 days, the court finding that the charges against him had been brought with malicious intent and were unfounded. The court-martial outcome meant ruin for Palliser. He was defended by Lord Sandwich, but still had to resign from Parliament and as Lieutenant-General of the Marines. He then demanded that a court martial be convened against him so that he could present his version of events during his defence. The court martial was convened, and he was acquitted after 21 days. However, he was censured in that he had failed to inform his superior officer of the battle damage in a timely manner.\nAfter his acquittal Palliser hoped to be reinstated as Lieutenant-General of Marines. Instead, in 1780 he was appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital by Lord Sandwich, and was again elected to Parliament for Huntingdon (1780–1784). On 24 September 1787 he was promoted to full admiral.\n\nJames Cook, a fellow Yorkshireman, first served under Palliser as Master's Mate of HMS \"Eagle\" from 1755 to 1758. Palliser would have supported his elevation to Master in 1757. Both were present at the siege of Quebec where Cook charted the approach to the city and the landing area. Following the Treaty of Paris, Cook was charged with surveying Newfoundland. As Governor, Palliser actively supported Cook's work and assisted in the publication of his acclaimed map of Newfoundland. During his term as Comptroller, Palliser supported Cook's first command of exploration in 1768, and his subsequent voyages. Cook named Cape Palliser, Palliser Bay and Palliser Isles after his \"worthy friend\". On Cook's death, Palliser erected a memorial to Cook at the Vache, his estate near Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire.\n\nPalliser died on 19 March 1796 at the Vache, and was buried on 26 March 1796 at the parish church of St Giles where there is a memorial to him. The Palliser Baronetcy passed to his great-nephew Hugh Palliser Walters who assumed by Royal Licence dated 18 January 1798 the surname and arms of Palliser. Palliser's illegitimate son George Thomas inherited the estate of the Vache.\n\na. Some sources use the Old Style dating system, in use in Britain until 1752, for Palliser's birth. As under this system the new year did not begin until 25 March, Palliser's birth was recorded as being in 1722. The article \"Admiral Sir HUGH PALLISER, Bt 1723–1796\", taken from Charnock, J. \"Biographia navalis . . from 1660 to the present time\" (6 volumes), states that Palliser was born \"on 26 February 1722\" (although the title of the article indicates he was born in 1723). The Royal Naval Museum website, accessed 6 August 2009, provides a biography, \"Biography: Hugh Palliser\", which states that Palliser \"was born on 26th February 1723\". The Government House website, accessed 6 August 2009, provides a biography, \"Palliser, Sir Hugh (1722–1796)\". It states that Palliser \"was born ... on February 22, 1722. The \"Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online\", accessed 6 August 2009 provides a biography, which states: \"PALLISER (Pallisser), Sir HUGH\", \"b. 22 Feb. 1722/23\". Contemporary scholarship by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography places his birth date as 26 February 1723.\n\n"}
{"id": "1877411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877411", "title": "Alianza Islámica", "text": "Alianza Islámica\n\nFrom the late 1980s to the mid-2000s, Alianza Islámica was the largest and most influential Latino Muslim organization in U.S. history. It was co-founded in New York City's fabled Spanish Harlem by three Puerto Rican Muslims - John (Yahya) Figueroa, Ramon (Rahim) Ocasio, and Freddie (Ibrahim) Gonzalez, who all lived within five blocks of each other.\n\nAlianza Islamica has become an iconic model for inner-city, grassroots Muslim activism with the new generation of Latino Muslim activists for its emphasis on bringing the message of Islam and Islamic service to the most disadvantaged and broken. The two remaining founders, Figueroa and Ocasio, have kept Alianza's message legacy alive through lectures, interviews and articles. most of which are available at the website alianzaislamica.org.\n\nFigueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez all came of age during the tumultuous '60s and early '70s. As teenagers, they became associated with the militant Young Lords Party during that organization's heyday in New York City. Ocasio, Figueroa, and Gonzalez participated in organizations affiliated with the Party. That organization stood out for its activism, vigorous social and educational programs, and unwavering support for Puerto Rican independence.\n\nAfter ending their association with the YLP, Figueroa and Ocasio briefly joined the Nation of Islam breakaway group The Five-Percent Nation. Though short-lived, their exposure to the Nation of Islam, with its strong message of self-reliance and economic independence, was to become a significant influence.\n\nBetween late 1972 and mid-1973, all three of the future founders converted to Islam. In 1975, Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez joined the Islamic Party of North America, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim organization. It was the United States' first constitutionally-based indigenous Islamic organization. With a keen emphasis on disciplined, coordinated activism, the Islamic Party expressed Islam through civic engagement and addressed problems of poverty and social and economic injustice.\n\nOcasio moved to IPNA's Washington headquarters and was eventually elected to that branch's Guidance Council. Meanwhile, Figueroa and Gonzalez continued the Party's work in New York. Ocasio rejoined Figueroa and Gonzalez in New York City in 1978. What followed were years of dawah (Islamic proselytizing) and attempts at organizing, which met with limited success.  \n\nIn 1986, the trio collaborated on a successful event at the Museo del Barrio on Fifth Avenue in New York entitled \"Reclamado Nuestra Herencia Islamica (Reclaiming Our Islamic Heritage). There they met Daniel Ahmad Mena from Florida and Carl Askia Al Amin from Chicago, who, along with Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez, formed the first iteration of Alianza Islamica. A virtual, three-city partnership, it most notable accomplishment was its eponymous journal, the first bilingual Islamic periodical ever published in the United States. Logistical problems, however, led to the organization's dissolution after nearly two years.\n\nIn the late 80s, Figueroa and Ocasio discussed going in a new direction: the establishment of a Barrio-based storefront center inspired by the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood's tea room of the '70s. Its calm, non-intimidating ambiance would distinguish the center, and be the antidote to alienating high pressure evangelizing. The center would be an unassuming, unobtrusive, and an organic part of the neighborhood.\n\nMeanwhile, Figueroa's work with recovering addicts led to a sizable number of converts and the first-ever Muslim recovery group, Brothers in Recovery. With these new Muslims at its core, Figueroa and Ocasio decided to resurrect Alianza Islamica. A storefront was secured at 1717 Lexington Avenue, near 107th Street, in El Barrio, Spanish Harlem.\n\nThough Alianza Islamica's priority was the spread of the message of Islam, a more holistic approach was advanced to best serve its disadvantaged community. To that end, Alianza developed GED and ESL programs as well as programs on health and nutrition, employment assistance, and drug counseling. A significant number of spousal abuse cases, primarily in marriages between Latinas and Arab husbands, prompted Alianza Islamica also to take action in and initiate a counseling program in this area.\n\nAt a time when Muslim institutions treated their fellow Muslims who died of AIDS/HIV as pariahs, Alianza became the first Islamic organization to ritually wash the bodies of their co-religionists who had died of the disease. Alianza Islamic also conducted outreach programs to educate Muslims and non-Muslims alike on AIDS/HIV.\n\nTo dispel the spectre of the alien, Alianza embarked on Islamizing Latino cultural elements. At religious holidays such as Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha, lamb and chicken replaced pork in traditional dishes, and congas and \"guitarras\" created a soundtrack authentically Muslim and Latino.\n\nAlianza Islamica cleared drug dealers from the neighborhood on at least two occasions. On the second occasion, the owner of a building across the street offered Alianza Islamica a new location in return for their assistance with ridding his building of drug dealers from the notorious Jamaican Posse. Alianza used the opportunity to establish La Mezquita del Barrio, the first Latino Muslim mosque on the East Coast, and quite possibly the nation.\n\nAfter Alianza cleared the drug dealers from the area, the landlord initiated eviction proceedings against Alianza. After its removal from the premises, Alianza resettled at 287 Alexander Avenue in the South Bronx. The organization disbanded shortly after a fire destroyed their building in 2005.  \n\n13.\n\nIbrahim Gonzalez went on to a distinguished career as a musician, activist, and television and radio personality known primarily for his popular radio show on WBAI. He died in his sleep In 2013 at age 57.\n\nAfter 30 years on the railroad, Figueroa devoted himself to drug counseling and writing and lecturing on Alianza Islamica's legacy  and Islam's spiritual dimension.\n\nOcasio also ended his railroad career after 35 years and settled to a life of writing, lecturing, and spending time on the family farm.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877414", "title": "In on the Kill Taker", "text": "In on the Kill Taker\n\nIn on the Kill Taker is the third full-length studio album by the American post-hardcore band Fugazi. It was released on June 30, 1993 through Dischord Records and was recorded at Inner Ear Studios and produced by Ted Niceley and Don Zientara. \"In on the Kill Taker\" captured the aggressiveness of the band's earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences.\n\nDue in part to the popularity of alternative rock in the early 1990s, \"In on the Kill Taker\" became the group's first album to debut on the \"Billboard\" charts and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.\n\nThe band had originally recorded songs in Chicago with producer Steve Albini at Chicago Recording Company studios, with the intention of releasing a two or three song EP. However, the group ended up recording a whole album's worth of material, but were ultimately unhappy with the result and re-recorded the entire album in Washington D.C. at Inner Ear Studios with Don Zientara and Ted Niceley handling production duties. The original recordings from the Chicago sessions have since been bootlegged onto filesharing networks.\n\nDespite the sessions in Chicago not entirely working out, it allowed the band to be well-prepared for what would become the album's proper recording sessions. According to singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto, “I think we really worked much harder on getting the songs together. We did a lot more pre-session demos, not just with Albini, but also using an 8-track reel-to-reel that we had bought to record our practices. It really changed the way we were able to work out the songs. It also helped us school ourselves a bit on how to engineer a basic recording.” The slightly more \"polished\" sound of the record was an intentional result of Niceley \"reacting to what he [had] heard from the popular bands with the same DNA as Fugazi that were getting heavy airplay\" at the time.\n\nThe material on \"In on the Kill Taker\" retained the band's aggressive and rhythmic style, but displayed more diversity as well. Fugazi downplayed any conscious efforts to make \"Kill Taker\" more experimental or diverse. According to Picciotto “I don’t really think of any of the records as being any more experimental than any of the others, because to us they were all experiments,” he said. “We were just trying to figure stuff out and push ourselves further each time. So to my ear every record sounds like a step forward, or sideways, or at least somewhere else from the one before it.” Matt Diehl of \"Rolling Stone\" labelled the album \"a virtual encyclopedia of punk-derived musical styles\" and recognized a large number of influences from bands such as The Ruts, U.K. Subs (for \"Facet Squared\" and \"Public Witness Program\"), Sonic Youth (for \"Smallpox Champion\"), Gang of Four (for \"Cassavetes\"), Pylon, \"early\" R.E.M. (for \"Sweet and Low\"), and even \"the speedy hardcore sound\" of MacKaye's former band Minor Threat (for \"Great Cop\"). \"23 Beats Off\" earned comparisons to an early Wire track \"literally stretched and pulled out to nearly seven minutes, [as] MacKaye goes from singing (as best he can) to screaming about a man who was once “at the center of some ticker tape parade,” who turns into “a household name with HIV.”\"\n\nJason Diamond writing for \"Pitchfork\" noted that \"[l]yrically, it’s also one of the more ambitious albums from the era. While burying any meaning beneath a pile of words like Cobain or bands like Pavement were so fond of doing was certainly \"du jour\", Fugazi liked to mix things up. Picciotto flexed that English degree he got from Georgetown, while MacKaye’s muses were Marx and issues of \"The Nation\".\" The open-ended lyrics to the opening track \"Facet Squared\" \"could either be about nationalism or the facades people wear when they go out in public [...]\". The Picciotto-written \"Smallpox Champion\" references the genocides perpetrated by the United States' founding fathers against native Americans. The album's lyrics frequently reference films, in particular the song \"Cassavetes\" which is a tribute to actor/filmmaker John Cassavetes, as well as a critique of Hollywood culture. The song \"Walken's Syndrome\" references Woody Allen's film \"Annie Hall\", where Christopher Walken's character feels an urge to crash into oncoming traffic at night.\n\nFilmmaker Jem Cohen, a long-time friend and collaborator of the band, was responsible for some of the album's art design and packaging. Found pieces of text and photographs were used to make up the overall layout. The cover image, showing a burned-out gold Polaroid of the Washington Monument, was found by Cohen in the street. The inner sleeve was a piece that Jeremy Blake, a friend of the band, found tacked to a light post in Chicago. The text on the cover side margin and back cover were also found on the ground in New York City by Cohen and contained the phrase \"...so I could have tried to put a stop to the hater, the adversary workers, iniquity evildoers. This is big because people in high places are in on the kill taker\".\n\nReleased on the 30th of June, 1993, \"In on the Kill Taker\" was the band's first album to enter the \"Billboard 200\", eventually peaking at #153. The album also topped the independent charts of both \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nBy the time the \"In on the Kill Taker\" tour was underway, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the band's sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's Roseland Ballroom in September 1993, music mogul and Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegün met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegün offered the band \"anything you want,\" their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer. The organizers of Lollapalooza also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down due to its tickets being priced at $33. An article by \"The Washington Post\" published in August that year noted that Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love - \"rock's couple of the moment\" - had attended a show of theirs in Seattle and even met the band afterwards. It also recounted a similar level of interest from Michael Stipe (who \"dance[d] the hokey-pokey in the street in front of the Capitol Theatre with Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty\") and Eddie Vedder (who wanted to know where MacKaye and Picciotto lived during a tour of Washington D.C.) as well. A retrospective Pitchfork review from 2018 noted that in the article, \"\"In on the Kill Taker\" isn’t brought up until somewhere near the bottom of the piece. It was almost like saying that you liked or knew them was like a badge of honor, it absolved you of your own sins. The music was eclipsed by the message.\"\n\nThe record garnered rave reviews from many publications including \"TIME\" and \"Rolling Stone\". \"Rolling Stone\" writer Matt Diehl wrote that Fugazi had reclaimed the \"only band that matters\" label from The Clash. In a year-end round-up of the best albums of the year, Brad Tyer of \"The Houston Press\" included the album and called the band \"[t]he beating heart of punk rock.\"\n\nHowever, the album received mixed reviews as well. Jonathan Gold of \"Los Angeles Times\" thought that on the album, \"Fugazi works in more or less the same meta-pop ballpark as Sonic Youth,\" and further stated: \"Fugazi hasn't a whimsical bone in its collective body, and the lyrics dance around the gloomiest topics in oblique college-poetry metaphor.\" \"Spin\" was even more dismissive, calling it \"Fugazi's most rigid and predictable album yet\" despite its \"spunky moments\", and criticized their politics as being didactic.\n\n\"In on the Kill Taker\" is now widely seen as the band's breakthrough album. Joe Gross, an independent scholar, authored a book about the album as a part of the 33⅓ series of books dedicated to classic & influential albums, published by Continuum in 2018. In its foreword, critic Rob Sheffield called it \"a widely misunderstood album from a widely misunderstood band, and yet it's an album that lies right at the heart of their story.\" Similarly, AllMusic critic Andy Kellman wrote: \"It's probably Fugazi's least digestible record from front to back, but each track has its own attractive qualities, even if not immediately perceptible.\" Writing for The A.V. Club in 2011, Kyle Ryan ranked it the best album of 1993, writing that it \"showed Fugazi finding its equilibrium; it wasn’t that the band had outgrown its punk-rock foundation (and the community its members treasured); Fugazi had expanded punk’s palette.\" In a very positive retrospective review, Jason Diamond writing for \"Pitchfork\" compared the impact of the album to Brian Eno's statement regarding The Velvet Underground's first album: \"the hundreds of thousands of people who bought \"In on the Kill Taker\" or saw the band as they trekked across America, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, that year and beyond, were impacted in some way.\"\n\nAcclaimed Music finds the album to be the 21st and 250th most acclaimed album of 1993 and of the 90s respectively. \n\"Public Witness Program\" has been covered by Screw 32. It is also the name of a band from Norway. The band Cassavetes took its name from the song of the same name on this album, as did the band Great Cop. Plunderphonics musician Chris Lawhorn used 11 tracks from this album for his album \"Fugazi Edits\". Greg Saunier and André de Ridder along with Stargaze \"re-composed\" the album in its entirety under the title \"Instruments,\" which was released on Record Store Day, 2019. Daniel P. Carter, Laura Pleasants (Kylesa) and Amen Dunes have all called the album one of their favorites.\n\nAll songs by Guy Picciotto, Ian MacKaye, Joe Lally, and Brendan Canty.\nTechnical\n\n"}

{"id": "1877416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877416", "title": "World Baseball Classic", "text": "World Baseball Classic\n\nThe World Baseball Classic (WBC) is an international baseball tournament sanctioned from 2006 to 2013 by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) and after 2013 by World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) in partnership with the Major League Baseball (MLB). It was proposed to the IBAF by Major League Baseball (MLB), the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), and other professional baseball leagues and their players associations around the world. It is one of the two main senior baseball tournament sanctioned by the WBSC, but the only one which grants to the winner the title of \"World Champion\".\n\nIt previously coexisted with Olympic baseball (until 2008) and the Baseball World Cup (until 2011) as IBAF-sanctioned tournaments, but baseball has not been on the Olympic program since 2008, after it was voted out by the International Olympic Committee in 2005. The final men's Baseball World Cup was held in 2011, and was discontinued in 2013, after an MLB suggestion to reorganize the international baseball callendar, WBSC accepted the suggestion after an executive meeting, giving the \"World Champion\" title for the WBC winner, on the condition that the Classic should have direct qualifications and follow international anti-doping rules.\n\nThe tournament is the first of its kind to have the national teams of IBAF's member federations feature professional players from the major leagues around the world, including Major League Baseball. In addition to providing a format for the best baseball players in the world to compete against one another while representing their home countries, the World Baseball Classic was created in order to further promote the game around the globe.\n\nAfter a three-year gap between the first two installments of the tournament, plans were made for the World Baseball Classic to be repeated every four years following the 2009 event. The third installment of the Classic was held in 2013, and the fourth was held in 2017.\n\nModeled after the FIFA World Cup and organized in large part as a response to the International Olympic Committee's decision to remove baseball as an Olympic sport in 2005, the WBC has grown into a major sporting event worldwide, though to a lesser extent in the United States. In fact, the final series in 2006 and 2009 rank among the highest-rated sporting events in Japanese television history.\n\nThe 16-team field for the inaugural 2006 tournament was pre-selected, featuring the countries judged to be the \"best baseball-playing nations\" in the world; no qualifying competition was held. The tournament format featured round-robin group play in the first and second rounds, followed by single-elimination semifinals and finals. The first game in WBC history saw South Korea defeat Chinese Taipei 2-0 before a crowd of 5,193 at the Tokyo Dome on March 3, 2006. South Korea went on to advance to the semifinals with a 6–0 record but lost to Japan (a team South Korea had beaten twice in the earlier rounds) for a berth in the final game. Meanwhile, Cuba defeated the Dominican Republic in the other semifinal. Japan then defeated Cuba 10–6 to be crowned the first champion of the World Baseball Classic.\n\nThe 2009 tournament featured the same 16 teams as 2006, but the controversial round-robin format from 2006 was replaced by a modified double-elimination format for the first two rounds (the semifinals and final game remained single-elimination). The eight teams advancing from the first round were the same as in 2006, except for a \"Cinderella\" performance by the Netherlands, which twice defeated the Dominican Republic to reach the second round. In the semifinals, South Korea defeated Venezuela while Japan defeated the United States. Japan then emerged victorious for the second straight Classic, winning the final game over South Korea 5–3 in 10 innings.\n\nThe buildup to the 2013 tournament included a qualifying round for the first time, with the four lowest finishers from 2009 having to re-qualify against 12 additional teams. This resulted in two new nations making their first appearances in the WBC, as Brazil and Spain respectively replaced Panama and South Africa. The round-robin format was revived for the tournament's first-round, while the second-round remained double-elimination. Italy was the biggest surprise in the early stages of the tournament, making it to the second round with wins over Canada and Mexico. The tournament ended in an all-Caribbean championship game, with the Dominican Republic defeating Puerto Rico, which had upset two-time champion Japan in the semifinals. The Dominican Republic also became the first (and to date, only) team to go undefeated (8-0) through the tournament.\n\nThe 2017 tournament returned to the format used in 2006, where both the first and second rounds were round-robin, though with the addition of tiebreaker games if needed. Colombia and Israel qualified for the first time, with Israel, using a roster mostly of Jewish American players, able to reach the second round in its WBC debut. Defending champion Dominican Republic extended its WBC winning streak to 11 games, dating to the 2013 tournament, before also being eliminated in the second round. The United States won its first WBC championship, defeating Japan and Puerto Rico in the semifinals and finals, respectively. Puerto Rico had been undefeated in the tournament before losing in the final.\n\nIn January 2020, MLB announced the 2021 WBC would expand the field to 20 teams. The additional four participants will be determined through qualifying tournaments, which were originally planned to take place in March 2020. However, On March 12, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that postpone due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe first two iterations of the Classic featured the same 16 teams, chosen by invitation. A qualifying round was added leading into the 2013 tournament and takes place in the year before the WBC proper. The addition of qualifying has so far allowed four nations (Brazil, Colombia, Israel, and Spain) from outside the original 16 to compete in the WBC.\n\nThe qualification setup for the 2013 and 2017 WBCs included the top 12 finishing teams from the previous WBC being automatically entered in the following edition, while the four lowest finishers (the teams that finished in last place in their first-round pools) were relegated to the qualifying round. Qualifying consisted of four four-team modified double-elimination tournaments, with the winners earning the last four slots in the main tournament.\n\nWith the 2021 WBC expanding to 20 teams, the qualifying format changed as well. All 16 participants from 2017 received automatic bids. The qualifying round consists of a pair of six-team double-elimination tournaments, from which the winners and runners-up go on to play in the 2021 WBC.\n\nAfter the conclusion of each WBC championship game, players from the losing team receive silver medals, followed by the winners receiving gold medals. The third-place team receives bronze medals at a separate date. The WBC does not hold a third-place playoff, so the ranking of the third- and fourth-placed teams is determined by the WBSC.\n\nA total of 20 nations have competed in the WBC proper, with 14 appearing in all five editions. Japan has been the most successful, as the only nation with multiple WBC titles (2006, 2009), the nation with the most wins in WBC play (23), and as the only nation to reach the championship round in all four WBCs. The Dominican Republic owns the best overall winning percentage in WBC games at .750 (18-6 record), bolstered by its 8-0 mark en route to the 2013 title. A surprising first-round elimination in 2009 stands out as the Dominican's only poor showing. If qualifying rounds are included, Israel also has a .750 winning percentage (9-3 record), with a 4-2 record in the WBC itself.\n\nAlong with Japan, three other nations have advanced to at least the second round in all four WBCs: Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the United States. The US posted an underwhelming 10-10 overall record through the first three WBCs, with only one appearance in the semifinals. The Americans broke through in 2017, going 6-2 on their way to their first WBC title. Cuba lived up to its history of strong international play by reaching the finals of the inaugural WBC in 2006 before losing to Japan. However, subsequent Cuban teams have failed to make a significant mark on the tournament, making three straight second-round exits and going just 2-7 in second-round games since 2009. Meanwhile, Caribbean rival Puerto Rico made consecutive appearances in the WBC finals in 2013 and 2017, albeit losing both, and stood second to Japan for the most all-time WBC wins (20) after the 2017 tournament. Conversely, of the 14 teams to appear in all four tournaments, three have never made the second round: Australia, Canada, and China.\n\nThe most significant award for individual performance during the tournament is the Most Valuable Player Award. Whichever player wins it receives a trophy after the final. The inaugural winner of the award in 2006 was Japan's Daisuke Matsuzaka, who pitched 13 innings and finished with a 3–0 record. Soon after this performance, Matsuzaka received a multimillion-dollar contract to join the Boston Red Sox of America's Major League Baseball. Again in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Matsuzaka received the world classic MVP, finishing with a record of 3–0 and an ERA of 2.54. In 2013, Robinson Canó won MVP after hitting .469 with two home runs and six RBI over the course of the tournament. Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman took home the award in 2017 for the United States. Stroman posted a 2.35 ERA over three starts and no-hit Puerto Rico through six innings in an 8-0 win in the Finals.\n\nAt the end of each edition of the World Baseball Classic, an all-star team is selected based on their play in the tournament. Three pitchers, eight other position players (one each at each position, including three outfielders), and a designated hitter are named to the team. Japanese pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka and Puerto Rican catcher Yadier Molina are the only players to be named to the All–WBC team twice.\n\nOverall, players representing 10 different countries have been named to an All-WBC team, with Japan and Puerto Rico leading the way with nine representatives each.\n\nAll-time WBC individual leaders in various statistical categories through the end of the 2017 tournament, excluding qualifier games.\n\nBatting\n\nPitching\n\nThe winning team of each World Baseball Classic is rewarded a large silver trophy as its primary recognition. The two trophies earned by Japan during the inaugural and second classics have been on display at the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to the standard rules of baseball, the World Baseball Classic employs the following additional rules:\n\nA pitcher cannot pitch more than:\n\nA pitcher can still finish a batter's plate appearance even if the limit is reached, but must come out after completing the plate appearance.\n\nA pitcher cannot pitch until:\n\nGames are called if one team is ahead by:\n\n\nMercy rules do not apply during the championship round.\n\nThe designated hitter rule applies for all games.\n\nStarting with the 11th inning, teams automatically start with runners on first and second base. The baserunners are the players in the two batting order positions previous to the leadoff batter for the inning (or substitutes called in to pinch-run for those players). Organizers put this rule in place starting with the 2009 tournament, although originally, it didn't come into effect until the 13th inning. The intention behind the rule is to help ensure extra-inning games end in as timely a manner as possible, reducing the chance of seeing marathon extra-inning games that place undue strain on players, particularly pitchers. As no extra-inning games in either the 2009 or 2013 WBCs reached the point where the rule came into play, it took until the 2017 WBC for it affect a game's outcome. There were three such games in 2017, and all three were decided in the 11th inning.\n\nDuring the first and second rounds, video review is available only for \"boundary\" calls, such as determining whether a potential home run ball was fair or foul, did or did not clear the fence, or was interfered with by a fan. Such reviews can only be initiated by the umpires and cannot be requested by the teams. For the championship round, video review is available for all situations it would be during a Major League Baseball regular season game.\n\nUnlike regular season play, where the number of runs by which a team wins a game is not relevant, the number of runs by which a WBC team wins may be relevant if a tie later develops in the standings. This caused problems during the 2013 WBC, where one game spawned a bench-clearing brawl between the Canadian and Mexican teams (Canadian hitter Chris Robinson had bunted for a base hit after Canada had already taken a large lead, causing Mexican pitcher Arnold Leon to throw three consecutive pitches at the next hitter, Rene Tosoni).\n\nA player is eligible to participate on a World Baseball Classic team if any one of the following criteria is met:\n\nIn 2006, many high caliber players from both Major League Baseball and in leagues around the world participated in the World Baseball Classic. Amongst the players that made the All–WBC team were Americans Derek Jeter and Ken Griffey Jr. From Japan, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Ichiro Suzuki and Tomoya Satozaki were on the team. Other internationals included players from Cuba—Yulieski Gurriel, Yoandy Garlobo and Yadel Martí; and from the Dominican Republic—Albert Pujols, Pedro Martínez and José Bautista. The 2009 Classic saw a similarly high-profile field, with a number of players such as Hall of Famers Pedro Martínez, Iván Rodríguez and Chipper Jones and the major international debuts of Cuba's Yoenis Céspedes and Aroldis Chapman.\n\nFor the 2013 tournament, many high-profile players decided not to participate, including key players from the 2009 Japanese team such as Yu Darvish, Ichiro, and Hisashi Iwakuma. However, other prominent players came, such as Miguel Cabrera, David Wright, R.A. Dickey, Joey Votto, Adrián González, Robinson Canó, and José Reyes, among many others.\n\nIn 2017, former All-Stars such as Adam Jones, Chris Archer, Buster Posey, Paul Goldschmidt, Andrew McCutchen and others played for the United States. For the Dominican Republic, former All-Stars Adrián Beltré, Robinson Canó, Manny Machado, José Reyes, Edinson Vólquez, and more participated. Adrián González played once more for Mexico, and Yadier Molina and Carlos Beltrán represented Puerto Rico alongside up-and-coming stars such as Javier Báez, Carlos Correa, and Francisco Lindor. Venezuela's roster included José Altuve and Miguel Cabrera.\n\nThe tournament was announced in May by Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig. Major League Baseball had been attempting to create such a tournament for at least two years; negotiations with the players' union (MLBPA) and with the team owners had held the plan back. Owners, notably New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, had been concerned about their star players being injured in international play before the beginning of spring training, and the professional season. This was a concern for the MLBPA as well, but their primary objection was with drug testing. MLB wanted the stricter Olympic standards in place for the tournament, while the union wanted current MLB standards in place. Eventually, a deal was reached on insurance for player contracts and a fairly tough drug testing standard. MLB teams would not be able to directly block their players from participating.\n\nSimilarly, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and its players' association had a disagreement over participation in the tournament. While the owners initially agreed to the invitation, the players' union was concerned about the time of year the tournament was scheduled to take place, as well as their right to be better represented for the tournament. On September 16, 2005, after four months of negotiations, NPB officially notified the IBAF and MLB they had accepted the invitation. In September 2012, after having threatened to boycott the event despite its domestic popularity, Japanese players agreed to take part after reaching a compromise with tournament organizers on sharing sponsorship and licensing revenue.\n\nThough the first two World Baseball Classic finals were shown on ESPN in the United States, the entire 2013 tournament was shown exclusively on MLB Network domestically. MLB Network also had the television rights for the 2017 Classic. Also at the moment, ESPN Deportes provides Spanish-language coverage and ESPN Radio has audio rights for the Classic. Sportsnet is the current broadcaster in Canada while ESPN America covers the tournament for the United Kingdom, Ireland and other parts of Europe.\n\nThe first qualifier round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic aired in the United States and Puerto Rico on the MLB Network; and in Australia, New Zealand, and selected surrounding islands on ESPN.\n\nExcluding qualifier games.\n\nUnlike comparable tournaments the FIFA World Cup and FIBA Basketball World Cup where one country hosts the entire event, each WBC has used multiple hosts spread around different parts of the world. Thus far, seven different nations have hosted at least one WBC pool, with each edition of the tournament featuring games played in Asia, Latin America, and the United States. The championship round is traditionally held at Major League Baseball stadiums in the U.S.\n\nThe following table lists nations who've hosted any WBC rounds in the first five iterations of the event, not including qualifiers, and without regard to whether a nation hosted multiple rounds in the same year.\n\n"}

{"id": "1877435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877435", "title": "Sydney and Louisburg Railway", "text": "Sydney and Louisburg Railway\n\nThe Sydney and Louisburg Railway (S&L) is a historic Canadian railway. Built to transport coal from various mines to the ports of Sydney and Louisbourg, the S&L operated in the eastern part of Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia. The railway uses a slightly different spelling for the town of \"Louisbourg\".\n\nMining of the Sydney Coal Field can be traced as far back as 1720 when French soldiers from Fortress of Louisbourg pried coal from exposed seams along the coast near Port Morien. Following the Seven Years' War, France ceded its remaining territories in Acadia and New France to Britain under the Treaty of Paris. Upon taking control of Ile Royale, Britain renamed it to Cape Breton Island and merged the territory into the Colony of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn 1784, Britain split the Colony of Nova Scotia, creating the colonies of New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island, reducing Nova Scotia to just its peninsular territory. In 1788, King George III authorized his son, Prince Frederick, the Duke of York, to be granted the mineral rights to Nova Scotia (then only the peninsular portion), however events such as the Napoleonic Wars put the application on hold until the end of conflict in 1815. At that time, the Duke was in financial difficulty and had an agent apply for the mineral rights which the King had authorized, however the paperwork was misplaced. In 1820, King George III died and the Duke faced financial ruin from debts; the same year saw the Colony of Cape Breton Island merged again into the Colony of Nova Scotia. In 1825 the unfinished application was discovered and approved (for all of Nova Scotia, including Cape Breton Island), whereby the Duke signed over the rights to the General Mining Association, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the Duke's creditors: the London jewelry firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell.\n\nThe GMA maintained a monopoly on mineral rights throughout the colony until 1857-1858 when it relinquished these to the colonial government except for certain areas it had developed surrounding the Sydney, Pictou and Cumberland coal fields. Between 1858-1870, the GMA opened 19 underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field, with most production destined for export to the northeastern United States. In addition to the GMA, many independently owned collieries opened in the Sydney Coal Field after 1858, including several US-financed operations at New Victoria, Bridgeport, and Reserve Mines.\n\nSeveral small railways (such as the Glasgow and Cape Breton Coal and Railway Company, and the Cape Breton Railway) were built by mining companies during this time. Geographic obstacles to shipping coal were evident during this age of industrialization with the only suitable harbours being Sydney or Louisbourg; efforts to build harbours on the exposed coast near Glace Bay were rendered ineffective by the weather. Although Sydney had a much more suitable harbour than Louisbourg, the former was frequently choked by heavy sea ice during the important coal-shipment season throughout the winter months. Louisbourg Harbour, which had been selected by the French military for its year-round ice-free waters when building Fortress Louisbourg during the early to mid-18th century, again became a valuable port when a railway line was built from the mines at Reserve to Louisbourg in 1877. This line was poorly built and was soon lost to a forest fire.\n\nLarge-scale industrialization came to the Sydney Coal Field when two large conglomerates were formed in the 1890s: the Dominion Coal Company, or DOMCO (in 1893), and the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company, or SCOTIA (in 1900). The latter was a successor to the GMA and focused its activities on the north side of Sydney Harbour, near Sydney Mines, whereas the former was a merger of various independent companies on the south side of the harbour.\n\nOn February 1, 1893 DOMCO was incorporated and it acquired or purchased all coal mines and railway lines between Sydney and Louisbourg on the south side of Sydney Harbour. The conglomerate came to own a variety of both standard and narrow gauge lines, as well as various harbour facilities and coal mines. DOMCO immediately set about to standardize its operations.\n\nDOMCO's railway lines were operated as a department of the company and were rationalized beginning the following year in 1894 when the International Railway was extended to Glace Bay and Caledonia, permitting the abandonment of a roughly parallel narrow gauge line. In 1895 DOMCO extended its railway system south to Louisbourg, following a route further east than the previous 1877 attempt. In 1899, DOMCO financed the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Limited, or DISCO, which constructed a steel mill on the south side of Sydney Harbour in Sydney's Whitney Pier neighbourhood, opening in 1901; this was in direct competition to a rival steel mill that was built by SCOTIA at the same time on the north side of the harbour at Sydney Mines. In 1908 DOMCO built a spur to New Waterford and further spurs were built in the Port Morien, Birch Grove, Donkin and Broughton areas in the 1910s. During the early part of the 20th century, DOMCO's railway lines were considered to be among the most modern in Canada.\n\nIn 1910, the Sydney and Louisburg Railway was incorporated to operate all DOMCO railway lines. Note that the spelling of the name \"Louisburg\" is different from the spelling of the harbour and town of \"Louisbourg\", which follows the French naming found in Fortress Louisbourg.\n\nIn 1914, the steel mill built by SCOTIA at Sydney Mines was closed, however the integrated mill at Sydney continued to expand, using Bell Island iron ore and locally produced coal as a fuel. In 1920, SCOTIA and DOMCO/DISCO merged to form British Empire Steel Corporation, or BESCO, which was reorganized as Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, or DOSCO, in 1930; SCOTIA and DOMCO remained separate BESCO/DOSCO subsidiaries, with SCOTIA being reorganized as Old Sydney Collieries.\n\nS&L generally served the DOMCO area to the south of the harbour, while the Old Sydney Collieries had its own small industrial railway which interchanged to the Intercolonial Railway line that ran around the west side of Sydney Harbour; the federal government-owned Intercolonial Railway (ICR) having built into the area in the 1890s. Following DOMCO's construction of the railway link between Sydney and Louisbourg in the mid-1890s, freight volumes rose sharply.\n\nMining employment reached a peak on Cape Breton Island immediately prior to World War I and the dawn of increased mechanization of the underground collieries. The S&L was operating over of track, of which was main line, and hauling in excess of 4 million tons of freight, mostly coal; this gave the S&L the distinction of having the most freight per mile of any railway in Canada. In addition to freight, the S&L also hauled passenger trains, mainly employees going to work in the mines or coming home; passenger traffic reached a peak of 176,000 revenue passengers hauled in 1913.\n\nCoal production peaked during World War II in the early 1940s and began to drop dramatically with the advent of internal combustion engines and other sources of heat. Due to the proximity and availability of the fuel, the S&L was one of the last railways in North America to keep its fleet of coal-powered steam locomotives, with 31 on the roster during the 1950s and over 400 employees; the S&L began to dieselize in 1960 however, the last steam locomotive wasn't retired until 1966. In 1961 DOSCO had its subsidiary the Cumberland Railway assume the operations of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway on Cape Breton Island. The reason for this change was that the S&L had been formed under a provincial charter in 1910, which made it ineligible for federal railway subsidies, while the Cumberland Railway, which had a federal charter, qualified for federal railway subsidies. The road did business as the Sydney & Louisburg Division of the Cumberland Railway.\n\nWith coal and steel fortunes flagging, DOSCO was purchased in 1957 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Avro Canada, whose assets were transferred to Hawker Siddeley Canada in 1962. Hawker-Siddley's DOSCO subsidiary announced in 1965 that its mines had only 15 years of production left and concluded that expense of opening new underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field would be too expensive. The company made its intentions clear that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months.\n\nIn response to a vast public outcry in industrial Cape Breton County, the Minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO's coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the Sydney area economy off the coal industry.\n\nOn July 7, 1967 the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. On March 30, 1968 DEVCO expropriated DOSCO's coal mines and the S&L, settling with Hawker-Siddeley for a payment of $12 million.\n\nThe S&L was reorganized as the Devco Railway, though for several years it continued to do business under its old name. With H.S. Haslam as general manager, the company operated of route with offices at Sydney; at that date it owned 15 diesel shunters and 1,100 freight cars.\n\nAlthough the old S&L was essentially shut down in 1972, DEVCO then revised its plans to try and exploit the remaining deposits to the best of its ability. Thus DEVCO continued to operate modest rail services and add new spurs and other facilities where needed. The line east of Glace Bay to Louisbourg fell into disuse as older mines were closed.\n\nAs part of a regional economic development initiative, DEVCO created a tourist railway named the Cape Breton Steam Railway, to operate between Glace Bay and Louisbourg. In 1973, the Sydney and Louisburg Railway Historical Society was created by retired employees of that company to assist with the tourist railway and to preserve the Louisbourg station. The tourist railway used former S&L equipment and stations, however by the late 1970s it was proving uneconomic to operate and was closed. The track east of Glace Bay was abandoned at this time.\n\nDEVCO continued operation of the railway until 2001, when it closed the Prince colliery, its last underground coal mine. The railway's assets, which included railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction were sold to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera, a Canadian multinational energy holding company based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. By 2003, the remaining railway was operating as the Sydney Coal Railway (SCR) which continues to operate a short line transporting coal from the international coaling piers on Sydney Harbour to the coal-fired Lingan Generating Station, owned by Emera.\n\n\n"}

Joseph has awakened from a dream in which an angel gave him instructions about the birth of Jesus. He has taken Mary into his home, completing their marriage, and this verse explains what occurs once the couple is united.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:25.\n\nThis verse suggests that Mary was a virgin at the time of Jesus' birth, and is cited as one of the scriptural evidences for the Virgin Birth. The word ἐγίνωσκεν literally translated \"knew\" refers often in the Bible to sexual relations. Eugene Boring says that in verses like this the author of the gospel seems to possess an extreme level of personal detail, while remarking that the command of the angel at says nothing about avoiding sexual relations either before or after the birth of Jesus.\n\nThis passage is the centre of controversy over the perpetual virginity of Mary. To many Protestants this verse is one of the central reasons for rejecting her perpetual virginity, seeing the author of Matthew, who states that sexual relations did not occur before the birth of Jesus, as implying that they occurred afterwards. Frederick Dale Bruner is one who interprets the word \"until\" as denoting that, after childbirth, \"Joseph and Mary will live together completely as husband and wife.\" Grant R. Osborne writes that \"the imperfect tense denotes that Joseph at no time had sexual intercourse with his wife \"until\" after the birth of Jesus.\" Presbyterian David Hill acknowledges that the wording does not absolutely deny Mary's perpetual virginity, but argues that if the idea of the perpetual virginity had been current at the time the gospel was written then the author of Matthew would have been more specific. On the other hand, Martin Luther always believed in the virginity of Mary even after giving birth to Jesus. Raymond E. Brown, a Roman Catholic, reports that K. Beyer states that in Greek and Semitic a negation \"until\" implies nothing about what happens afterwards; Brown himself says that Matthew is concerned only with stressing Mary's virginity at the time of giving birth to Jesus and not with what followed and he asks whether Matthew was in a position to know. \n\nAs reported in , the child was named eight days after his birth at the time of the circumcision. The phrase \"he was called\" in the original Greek (ἐκλήθη) is passive voice. However, in Matthew 1:21 Joseph is told he will do the naming. Robert H. Gundry believes that having Joseph name Jesus is a clear demonstration of Jesus' legal status as his son, and thus as an heir of King David, a continuation of the argument made by the genealogy.\n"}

They have long oval leaves and the vein enters the horizontal direction. From April to June, the plant's flowering season, it produces pure white flowers on top of the stem. The stem has a cylindrical shape, with a diameter of about .\n\nA variety of it, \"L. longiflorum\" var. \"eximium\", native to the Ryukyu Islands, is taller and more vigorous. It is extensively cultivated for cut flowers. It has irregular blooming periods in nature, and this is exploited in cultivation, allowing it to be forced for flowering at particular periods, such as Easter. However, it can be induced to flower over a much wider period. This variety is sometimes called the \"Bermuda lily\" because it has been much cultivated in Bermuda.\n\n\"Lilium longiflorum\" is known as the Easter lily because in Christianity, it is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ, which is celebrated during Eastertide. The \"lily has always been highly regarded in the Church\", as Jesus Himself referenced the flower, saying \"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these\" (). Moreover, according to pious legend, \"after Jesus' death and resurrection, some of these beautiful flowers were found growing in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus went to pray the night before His crucifixion. Legend has it that these flowers sprung up where drops of Jesus' sweat fell as he prayed\". In many Christian churches, the chancel is adorned with Easter lilies throughout the Paschal season. A poem of the early 1900s titled \"Easter Lilies\" by S.R. Allen, delineates this custom:\nFrom the 1890s to the early 1920s, there was a thriving export trade of bulbs from Bermuda to New York. A disease affected the Bermuda lilies: this was identified by Lawrence Ogilvie. In 1903, USDA Agricultural Research Services (ARS) started to distribute disease free plant materials and seeds. The agency also started a breeding program, and released one of the first dwarf cultivars for potted-plant production in 1929. Prior to USDA's effort, lily bulbs were mostly imported from Japan before the 1940s. The supply of bulbs was suddenly cut off after the attack on Pearl Harbor and Easter lilies became extremely valuable in the United States.\n\nCurrently, nearly all Easter lily bulbs used in North America are grown on coastal bottom lands in northwestern California and southwestern Oregon, particularly in the town of Smith River, California.\n\nThe Easter lily is a rich source of steroidal glycosides. It also contains bitter principles such as 3,6′-diferuloylsucrose.\n\nSome \"Lilium\" species are toxic to cats. This is known to be so especially for \"L. longiflorum\", though other \"Lilium\" and the unrelated \"Hemerocallis\" can also cause the same symptoms. The true mechanism of toxicity is undetermined, but it involves damage to the renal tubular epithelium (composing the substance of the kidney and secreting, collecting, and conducting urine), which can cause acute kidney injury. Veterinary help should be sought, as a matter of urgency, for any cat that is suspected of eating any part of a lily – including licking pollen that may have brushed onto its coat.\n\n\n"}

Joseph Kurtz, D.D., the fourth Archbishop of Louisville, is in residence at the Cathedral. Michael T. Wimsatt, S.T.D., serves as administrator.\n\nIn 1811, a small group of Catholics in Louisville formed Saint Louis Church at 10th and Main Streets. Previously, Father Stephen Theodore Badin, the first priest ordained in the United States, called the \"circuit rider priest,\" had served the Louisville area, along with much of the American frontier.\n\nIn September 1821, Father Philip Hosten became the first residential pastor of Saint Louis Church. Fr. Hosten died one year later during an outbreak of yellow fever in the city. By 1830, a larger Saint Louis Church was built five blocks south of the Ohio River on Fifth Street. The Cathedral of the Assumption stands on that site to this day.\n\nThe Diocese of Bardstown, the first inland diocese in the United States, was established in 1808, with Benedict Joseph Flaget as the first Bishop of Bardstown. The diocese included most of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.\n\nIn 1841, the diocese was moved from Bardstown to Louisville, and Saint Louis Church became Saint Louis Cathedral. Bishop Flaget, now the Bishop of Louisville, decided in 1849 that a new cathedral should be built. However, Bishop Flaget died on February 11, 1850, a few months after the laying of the cornerstone for the new church building. His remains rest today in a chapel in the Cathedral Undercroft.\n\nThe project begun by Bishop Flaget was completed by Bishop Martin John Spalding, the second Bishop of Louisville. On October 3, 1852, the new Cathedral was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of the Cathedral of the Assumption. The new Cathedral was almost an identical but larger replica of its predecessor, St. Louis Church. The new Cathedral was built around St. Louis Church which, when the cathedral was completed, was disassembled and carried piece by piece out the front doors.\n\nThe Diocese of Louisville was elevated in 1937 to become the Archdiocese of Louisville and the metropolitan province for all the dioceses in Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nThe newly built Cathedral of the Assumption was nearly destroyed soon after its building due to anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant bigotry in the city of Louisville. On Monday, August 6, 1856, George D. Prentice, editor of the Louisville \"Journal\", placed an article of his own opinion in the paper that speculated the possibility of takeover by immigrants: German and Irish. This also included accusations of vote tampering. Fearing for their safety, the \"Know Nothing Party\" of Nativists bombarded and ambushed local immigrant workers with ammunition, in total killing 22 German and Irish immigrants across the city. Also, the Cathedral and the newly built St. Martin of Tours (completed in 1854) were believed to house weaponry in their basements. They were threatened to be burned, but the mayor of the city at the time, John Barbee, himself a \"Know-Nothing,\" inspected the churches and cleared them of such accusations.\n\nWith the 1982 arrival of the Most Reverend Thomas C. Kelly, the third Archbishop of Louisville, the Cathedral of the Assumption began anew as an archdiocesan center, under the pastoral direction of the Archbishop and the William L. Fichteman, the current Rector of the Cathedral.\n\nIn 1985, the establishment of the Center for Interfaith Relations (formerly the \"Cathedral Heritage Foundation\") began a push for renovation of existing facilities, expansion of the Cathedral complex, and revitalization of the Cathedral's mission to the broader community as a spiritual center in Louisville. Together, the Cathedral Parish and the Cathedral Heritage Foundation have brought the Cathedral into the new millennium.\n\nRenovation began in 1988 with the removal of sections of the Cathedral spire, along with the finial and cross. The year 1989 saw a comprehensive restoration plan adopted. In June 1991, after one hundred years of disuse, the completely restored Cathedral undercroft was reopened. Finally, in February 1993, renovation on the main Cathedral space began and continued for nearly two years. The grand reopening of the Cathedral was celebrated in 1994, with a completely renovated Cathedral space.\n\nIn May 1994, Archbishop Kelly moved into the Cathedral rectory, making him the first bishop to live in Downtown Louisville in one hundred twenty years. In June 1998, the Cathedral spire and bell tower were completely renovated.\n\nIn May 2005, the first phase of renovations began on the Cathedral School building, which now houses the Cathedral Parish office. Phase one renovations will provide more space for the parish offices while phase two will provide renovated, state-of-the-art practice space for the Cathedrals renowned choirs.\n\nThe Cathedral complex now houses the main Cathedral building, with a Eucharistic chapel to the rear, as well as the Cathedral undercroft and St. Louis Hall, the Sandefur Dining Room for the homeless, the Patterson Education Center, the Cathedral school building (housing the parish offices), and the rectory, providing housing for the Archbishop and other Cathedral staff.\n\nDuring the renovation of the Cathedral by the Conrad Schmitt Studios, the walls were faux finished to resemble stone blocks. The effect is convincing enough that many visitors to the Cathedral are astonished to learn that the walls are not actual stone. In addition, much of the architectural work around the Coronation Window is a \"faux\" finish.\n\nThe stained glass that formerly stood in the side windows was removed to allow the congregation to view the surrounding buildings, in order to facilitate a sense of attachment to the community. The panels are now displayed in the front windows of the Cathedral's Patterson Education Center.\n\nThe nave, the body of the church, accommodates nine hundred sixty-six people for daily Masses and other ceremonies. The nave has no pews, utilizing individual, movable chairs, complete with kneelers. Usually arranged in straight rows facing the altar and allowing for a center aisle and two side aisles, the chairs may also be placed in rows the length of the church, facing each other across the center aisle for special services such as those of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. It may also be noted that during the renovations by Conrad-Schmitt, the entire building was cracked down the middle and deeply in danger of collapse. To resolve this, steel strand beams were mounted from wall to wall in the nave to provide a counter push and pull action, keeping the building from falling in or out.\n\nThe baptistry holds a prominent position in the church because through it one gains entrance into the Church. A person being baptized may choose either immersion in the pool or infusion, pouring of water from the font. The old baptismal font was relocated to the rear of the nave, immediately inside the entrance doors, and an immersion pool, crafted of red granite, bronze, and marble from the original Communion rail, was added in the last renovation.\n\nThe altar, the center of worship in the church, incorporates a base of gray marble and a red granite table like the granite of the Baptismal pool. The gray marble was taken from the original high altar, which was removed from the back of the sanctuary in the renovation following Vatican II.\n\nThe brass Lamb of God, in Latin Agnus Dei, is a symbol of Jesus, the Paschal sacrifice offered on this altar. The gray marble base of the altar has carved on the right side an open book and several keys, on the left a bishop's mitre and crozier. The book represents God's word found in the Holy Scripture, the foundation of the bishop's teaching. The keys remind us of Christ's words to Peter, \"I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven\" (Matthew 16:19). The shape of the crozier recalls its origin as a shepherd's crook, or staff, suggesting the bishop's pastoral role, \"Feed my lambs. Tend my sheep\" (John 21:15–17).\n\nThe colorful Coronation Window illustrates the Cathedral's special dedication to the Virgin Mary, the Mother of Jesus, under the title of the \"Cathedral of the Assumption\".\n\nThe window, designed and installed by the Blum Art Company of Louisville in 1883, depicts the crowning of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven. It is one of the oldest American-made stained glass windows. This window, in the early half of the 20th century, had been moved to the front of the tower, with a new Assumption window replacing it. During restoration, the windows were switched to place the Coronation Window in its original place in the sanctuary. It was in this crane-operated delicate process that the building was cracked, temporarily halting all work. Conrad Schmitt Studios conserved the historic glass and restored the original appearance of the windows by painting the missing artwork on 2mm slide glass and sandwiching them to the conserved glass before re-leading.\n\nAccording to Catholic doctrine, after the Virgin Mary died, Jesus assumed her body into heaven. As the first among the faithful, she is a sign of the eternal goal toward which all the faithful advance. Centuries of Christian artists honored Mary's preeminence by depicting her being crowned as Queen of Heaven.\n\nThe Ceiling Fresco depicts cherubs surrounding the Virgin Mary at the time of her assumption into Heaven.\n\nAccording to the Historic Structure Report of 1986, a Mr. Landrop, or Gandrop, of Cincinnati painted the fresco. The fresco remained until 1964, through many different changes to the interior. At that time, it was painted over after some plaster fell and was patched. It was rediscovered when again plaster fell from the ceiling, revealing the jewel that lay beneath. The fresco has been painstakingly restored to its earlier beauty.\n\nThe cathedra, behind the altar, is the official chair of the Archbishop. It is an ancient symbol of the tradition and authority of the bishop in the life of the Church. The cathedra represents his three main offices of teaching, sanctifying and governing.\n\nA cathedral houses the official chair of the bishop of the diocese. In Latin, the word \"chair\" is \"cathedra\", from which the name \"cathedral\" is derived. The cathedra, upholstered in red suede, has painted on its back the coat of arms of the Archdiocese of Louisville.\n\nSymbols on the coat of arms, important to Louisville and the Archdiocese, include:\n\n\nThe presider's chair was purchased from a local antique store because of its similarity in design to the cathedra. From here, the priest presides during the Mass.\n\nAbove the entrance are the choir loft and the magnificent pipe organ built by Steiner-Reck, Inc., of Louisville in 1983. The organ features three manuals and forty-three ranks. Fanfare trumpets were added in 1994, along with both 32-foot ranks, full MIDI capability, and a Gothic casework of hand-carved mahogany. The center section of the loft railing is original, featuring small pointed arches with a reproduction of the design on the side sections.\n\nThe Ambo, or pulpit, incorporates gray marble and red granite. Here the scriptures are proclaimed, the responsorial psalm is sung, and the homilist addresses the congregation.\n\nLike European cathedrals, the Cathedral of the Assumption has tried to respond to the needs of the community, serving as a hospice, an orphanage, and a shelter for the poor. Presentation Academy, Saint Joseph Infirmary, and Saint Vincent's Orphanage each grew out of the Cathedral undercroft. This tradition continues at the Cathedral of the Assumption, with many programs reaching out to the social and spiritual concerns of the community, including:\n\n\nFounded in 1985 as the Cathedral Heritage Foundation, the foundation changed its name to the Center for Interfaith Relations in 2006 after achieving its three original goals. The primary mission was to undertake the restoration of the Cathedral. Twenty years later, it continues to provide community outreach, fulfilling a portion of the mission of the Cathedral. Development of spiritual, educational, and cultural experiences is CIR's continuing mission, with the goal of inspiring and fostering individual growth. In an expression of the Cathedral's commitment to ecumenism, CIR serves to increase understanding among diverse cultures and to advance ecumenical understanding.\n\nThe Cathedral choirs have made three European tours, most recently in 2004 touring England and Ireland, singing at Killarney Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral, and St. Martin-in-the-Fields under the direction of Dr. Phillip Brisson, DMA (Eastman School of Music, 2005), Director of Music for the Cathedral. The choirs have recorded two compact disks, and a third disk of their most recent international tour repertoire is in the planning stage. The Cathedral choirs have also performed many times with the Louisville Orchestra.\n\nThe Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir of approximately forty-five voices and is completely composed of volunteer amateurs, with the exception of four paid section leaders. The Cathedral Choir of Trebles and Mixed Voices consists of approximately seven girls and boys ranging in ages from twelve to seventeen, three adult women and six adult men. The two choirs of the Cathedral, though rehearsing separately, sing the same literature for both Sunday morning Masses. Their repertoire includes examples of the great choral literature from early chant through the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th-century periods. They also come together for special projects, including the Masses of Holy Week and their acclaimed international tours.\n\nThe Cathedral also boasts many talented semiprofessional cantors who share their gifts with the Cathedral community for weekend and Holy Day Masses. There is also a dedicated corps of weekday cantors who offer their services for each of the five weekday noon Masses.\n\nAdditionally, the clock/bell tower is home to numerous Petit and Fritsen tuned bells from the Netherlands and is one of the few carillons in Kentucky. Smith's Bell and Clock Service from Mooresville, Indiana, is responsible for taking care of the bells and is currently renovating one of the clock face time pieces. Rappelling via a harness and pulley system was necessary to take the hands down and repair the clock movement. Other repairs and building renovation are currently in progress.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Assumption welcomes members of Christ Church Episcopal Cathedral to visit the Cathedral, and the two Cathedrals have formed a covenant relationship. An annual Lenten Vespers is held by the covenant Cathedrals. The highlight of the covenant relationship is the joint Service of Light held on Holy Saturday. The congregations of both Cathedrals meet between the two churches and jointly bless the new fire used to light the Paschal candle. From there, each congregation processes to their respective Cathedral.\n\nIn November 2000, the Cathedral of the Assumption and St. Louis Parish (Jeremie, Haiti) formed a sister parish relationship. The exchange of gifts, talents, and spirituality is the goal of the sister parish relationship. Awareness and communication between the Cathedral of the Assumption and St. Louis Parish is maintained by the Sister Parish Committee.\n\n"}

It is situated close to Birmingham City Centre and is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation.\n\nOriginally a small pool named Roach Pool in Rotton Park, it was extensively enlarged by Thomas Telford between 1824-1829 to supply water to the Birmingham and Wolverhampton Levels of the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) canal system via Icknield Port Loop at the foot of the dam. It was excavated to a depth of 40 feet (12 metres) and covers an area of , holding of water, and was the largest expanse of water in Birmingham at the time. It is supplied by small streams and a feeder from Titford Reservoir (Titford Pools) in Oldbury. It was formed by damming a small stream. The dam is a 330-metre-long earth embankment with a height of 10 metres near the centre.\n\nThe reservoir and gatehouse were designed by Thomas Telford and the latter is a listed building in corporate BCN octagonal style.\nIn 1873, it was crossed by Charles Blondin, on a tightrope. His feat is marked by a 1992 statue on the nearby \"Ladywood Middleway\" ring road.\n\nThe reservoir is surrounded by woodland and grassland. The total area of the site is . It supports a variety of birds, in addition to newts and bats.\n\nIn addition to supplying water to the canals, the reservoir is used for leisure activities including angling, sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, kayaking and rowing.\n\nEdgbaston Reservoir is home to three rowing clubs, Birmingham Rowing Club, Birmingham City University Rowing Club and the University of Birmingham Boat Club. All are housed within the same boathouse. The site has also been chosen to house a new Birmingham Schools rowing initiative, with the three aforementioned clubs assisting in the running of the scheme. Birmingham Canoe Club also shares the space during the summer months (June to September), paddling on the reservoir.\n\nThe Midland Sailing Club is also based at Edgbaston Reservoir, and often race sailing boats around a marked course. Windsurfers also use the reservoir. Further to this, TS Vernon Sea Cadets use the reservoir as a base.\n\nUntil 2017 the Reservoir was home to Edgbaston Watersports, which provided water and land activities for school, college and youth groups from their base on the Icknield Port Road side of the reservoir.\n\nThe Reservoir perimeter provides a pleasant route for joggers, with a gravel and tarmac path throughout its 1.75 mile (2.8 km) circumference.\n\nThe fishing season runs from 16 June to 14 March. Licences are available from the Environment Agency.\n\nAs of April 2019 the car park is closed to vehicles after complaints of antisocial behaviour.\n\nThe reservoir usually has a gentle breeze across it due to the lack of large buildings or objects surrounding it, which makes it ideal for sailing.\n\nDuring winter there can be strong, icy, northerly winds blowing over the city, which can freeze the reservoir over due to its exposed northern side (where the dam is situated). In recent years, the reservoir has frozen over - in both January 2009 and 2010 to the extent that it could be walked upon, although this is strongly discouraged.\n\nIn the summer the reservoir is often extremely busy with members of the public coming for picnics and walks around the reservoir's perimeter path.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877459", "title": "Nerve conduction study", "text": "Nerve conduction study\n\nA nerve conduction study (NCS) is a medical diagnostic test commonly used to evaluate the function, especially the ability of electrical conduction, of the motor and sensory nerves of the human body. These tests may be performed by medical specialists such as clinical neurophysiologists, physical therapists, chiropractors, physiatrists (physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians), and neurologists who subspecialize in electrodiagnostic medicine. In the United States, neurologists and physiatrists receive training in electrodiagnostic medicine (performing needle electromyography (EMG) and NCSs) as part of residency training and in some cases acquire additional expertise during a fellowship in clinical neurophysiology, electrodiagnostic medicine, or neuromuscular medicine. Outside the US, clinical neurophysiologists learn needle EMG and NCS testing.\n\nNerve conduction velocity (NCV) is a common measurement made during this test. The term NCV often is used to mean the actual test, but this may be misleading, since velocity is only one measurement in the test suite.\n\nNerve conduction studies along with needle electromyography measure nerve and muscle function, and may be indicated when there is pain in the limbs, weakness from spinal nerve compression, or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder. Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck, mid back pain or low back pain, and for this reason, evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain, thoracic pain, or cervical spine pain.\n\nNerve conduction studies are used mainly for evaluation of paresthesias (numbness, tingling, burning) and/or weakness of the arms and legs. The type of study required is dependent in part by the symptoms presented. A physical exam and thorough history also help to direct the investigation. Some of the common disorders that can be diagnosed by nerve conduction studies are:\n\nThe nerve conduction study consists of the following components\n\n\nThe nerve conduction study is often combined with needle \"electromyography\". \n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General recently identified the use of NCSs without a needle electromyography at the same time a sign of questionable billing.\n\n\"Motor NCS\" Motor NCS are obtained by stimulating a motor nerve and recording at the belly of a muscle innervated by that nerve. The CMAP is the resulting response, and depends on the motor axons transmitting the action potential, status of the neuromuscular junction, and muscle fibers. The CMAP amplitudes, motor onset latencies, and conduction velocities are routinely assessed and analyzed. As with sensory NCS, conduction velocity is calculated by dividing distance by time. In this case, however, the distance between two stimulation sites is divided by the difference in onset latencies of those two sites, providing the conduction velocity in the segment of nerve between the two stimulation sites. This method of calculating conduction velocity thereby avoids being confounded by time spent traversing the neuromuscular junction and triggering a muscle action potential (since these are subtracted out).\n\n\"Sensory NCS\" are performed by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve while recording the transmitted potential at a different site along the same nerve. Three main measure can be obtained SNAP ( Sensory nerve action potential)amplitude, sensory latency and conduction velocity. The SNAP amplitude (in microvolts) represents a measure of the number of axons conducting between the stimulation site and the recording site. Sensory latency (in milliseconds) is the time that it takes for the action potential to travel between the stimulation site and the recording site of the nerve. The conduction velocity is measured in meters per second and is obtained dividing the distance between stimulation site and the recording site by the latency: Conduction velocity = Distance/Latency\n\n\"F-wave study\" uses supramaximal stimulation of a motor nerve and recording of action potentials from a muscle supplied by the nerve. This is not a reflex, per se, in that the action potential travels from the site of the stimulating electrode in the limb to the spinal cord's ventral horn and back to the limb in the same nerve that was stimulated. The F-wave latency can be used to derive the conduction velocity of nerve between the limb and spine, whereas the motor and sensory nerve conduction studies evaluate conduction in the segment of the limb. F waves vary in latency and an abnormal variance is called \"chrono dispersion\". Conduction velocity is derived by measuring the limb length, D, in millimeters from the stimulation site to the corresponding spinal segment (C7 spinous process to wrist crease for median nerve). This is multiplied by 2 as it goes to the cord and returns to the muscle (2D). 2D is divided by the latency difference between mean F and M and 1 millisecond subtracted (F-M-1). The formula is formula_1.\n\nH-reflex study uses stimulation of a nerve and recording the reflex electrical discharge from a muscle in the limb. This also evaluates conduction between the limb and the spinal cord, but in this case, the afferent impulses (those going toward the spinal cord) are in sensory nerves while the efferent impulses (those coming from the spinal cord) are in motor nerves.\nThis process cannot be changed.\n\nIn 1998, a small-pain-fibers (spf-NCS) method was cleared by the FDA. This method uses an electrical stimulus with a neuroselective frequency to determine the minimum voltage causing conduction. Rather than comparing the data with population averages on a bell-shape curve, which at best has about 65% sensitivity, the patient is his own control. In a three-year LSU Pain Center study, it was found that the nerve requiring the greatest voltage to cause conduction of the A-delta (Fast Pain) fibers identified nerve root pathology with 95% sensitivity. Besides being painless, the test is fast. This test can determine nerve impingement/pathology (pain causing) within the spine (nerve root level) where EMG and Velocity Tests fail. The test uses a potentiometer to objectively measure the amplitude of the action potential at a distant site along the nerve being tested. The patient confirms a sensation when the nerve fires. Objectivity of the patient's response is confirmed by the measurement of nerve recruitment for surrounding nerves and is displayed on the instrument. The impinged nerve (pain fibers) can only report (peak) momentarily while recruiting other nerves to assist and sustain the reporting of the stimulus. Non impinged nerves (pain fibers) do not recruit surrounding nerves and this is readily seen on the display.\n\nThe spf-NCS does not require myelin loss to detect function change, so velocity is not measured. The Small-Pain-Fibers NCS (pf-NCS) is the preferred test with over 95% accuracy for determining the spine level(s) and side(s) for Small Pain Fiber impingement/pathology allowing for the most accurate diagnosis and treatment procedures for patients experiencing back pain. Patients diagnosed with the EMG/NCV studies alone (while experiencing pain but having no significant myelin loss) were misdiagnosed in over 50% of cases including the diagnosis and treatment of incorrect nerve root levels and sides in patients.\n\nThe interpretation of nerve conduction studies is complex and requires the expertise of health care practitioners such as clinical neurophysiologists, medical neurologists, chiropractic neurologists or physiatrists. In general, different pathological processes result in changes in latencies, motor, and/or sensory amplitudes, or slowing of the conduction velocities to differing degrees. For example, slowing of the NCV usually indicates there is damage to the myelin. Another example, slowing across the wrist for the motor and sensory latencies of the median nerve indicates focal compression of the median nerve at the wrist, called carpal tunnel syndrome. On the other hand, slowing of all nerve conductions in more than one limb indicates generalized diseased nerves, or generalized peripheral neuropathy. People with diabetes mellitus often develop generalized peripheral neuropathy.\n\nNerve conduction studies are very helpful to diagnose certain diseases of the nerves of the body. The test is not invasive, but can be painful due to the electrical shocks. The shocks are associated with a low amount of electric current so they are not dangerous to anyone. Patients with a permanent pacemaker or other such implanted stimulators such as deep brain stimulators or spinal cord stimulators must tell the examiner prior to the study. This does not prevent the study, but special precautions are taken.\n\nCardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are used increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS.\n\nNo known contraindications exist from performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients. In addition, no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature. Evoked potential testing, likewise, has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy.\n\n\n"}

On April 2, 1999 these divisions split to become Varian Semiconductor, Varian, Inc. and Varian Medical Systems.\n\nVarian Medical Systems has acquired other companies including Pan-Pacific Enterprises, ACCEL Instruments, Bio-Imaging Research, Inc. Sigma Micro Informatique Conseil, Argus Software, Velocity Medical Solutions. and MeVis Medical Solutions AG \n\nIn January 2018, the company announced the acquisition of Sirtex Medical for $1.3 billion.\n\nIn 2019, the company acquired CyberHeart, a privately-held company with intellectual property (IP) that covers the use of radiation in the heart (cardiac radioablation) and other forms of radiosurgery for cardiovascular disease.\n\n30.01.2017 spin-off of Varex Imaging Corporation (manufacturing of X-ray imaging products) from Varian Medical Systems had been successfully completed.\n\nVarian manufactures a range of megavoltage LINACs with varying levels of features and complexity, for example different numbers of multileaf collimators or the ability to perform radiosurgery.\n\nTrueBeam is a radiotherapy system.\n\nThe EDGE radiosurgery suite was launched in 2012. The first cancer centers to use the new system were the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal and Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn 2017, Varian launched Halcyon. The system features unique dual-layer MLC that enables high modulation with low leakage for every field or arc.Halcyon is engineered ergonomically to be intuitive, friendly and comfortable for clinical staff and patient alike. This human centered approach means there are fewer parts and protocol for staff to worry about, more time freed up to advance clinical capabilities, and most importantly, more opportunities to provide the highest level of care for every patient. \n\nVarian manufactures the ProBeam Proton Therapy System, with current and planned installations at several sites globally. These are an all pencil-beam scanning proton therapy system utilizing IMTP (intensity modulated proton therapy), which was developed with PSI of Switzerland. Varian also develops medical software and radiology information system for proton treatment planning system.\n\nSeptember 16, 2019 — At the 2019 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual meeting, being held Sept. 15-18 in Chicago, Varian announced Ethos therapy, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven holistic solution designed to increase the capability, flexibility and efficiency of radiotherapy. This new solution is designed to deliver an entire adaptive treatment in a typical 15-minute timeslot, from patient setup through treatment delivery.\n\nIn 1999 Varian Medical Systems, Inc. sued a former employee for defamation in Varian v. Delfino. The terminated employee Dr. Michelangelo Delfino posted numerous messages criticizing the company on the Internet. The case finally settled on undisclosed terms. The lawsuit itself was controversial, heavily publicized, and led to a landmark ruling about California's anti-SLAPP statute. Some market-based workers rights activists uphold Delfino as an example because he mortgaged his house to pay his legal bills related to the lawsuit with Varian.\n\nOn April 25, 2012 a US federal judge in Pittsburgh awarded attorney fees, costs, and doubled damages totaling $73.6 million to the University of Pittsburgh after the university won a suit on medical patent infringement grounds against Varian.\n\n\n"}

It crosses the main course of the Paraná River and touches down on several islands of the Paraná Delta in the way.\n\nWorks on the project began in 1998, but they were repeatedly interrupted due to lack of continued funding from the national and the provincial state, especially in the worst part of the Argentine economic crisis of 2001. Public transit access to the bridge was opened on May 20, 2003.\n\nThe link between the two cities spans a total of 59.4 kilometers (37 mi). The total length of the various bridges and their viaducts is 12.2 km (7.5 mi). The main bridge is 4,098 meters (13,440 ft) long, with central cable-stayed span of 350 meters (1,148 ft). Among the materials used were about 250,000 cubic meters (326,987 yd³) of concrete, 63,000 tons of ADN-420 type steel, and 17,618 tons of asphalt. The access to the main bridge on the western side is in the northern border of Rosario, on the limit with the city of Granadero Baigorria. The official name of the main bridge (cable-stayed) is \"Nuestra Señora del Rosario\" (\"Our Lady of Rosario\").\n\nThe project was executed by a private company (\"Puentes del Litoral S. A.\"), which was granted subsidies from the national state and the provincial states of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos, totalling about $385 million . The company received the operation and maintenance concession of the bridge for 25 years.\n\nUntil the opening of this bridge, the only road link between the two provinces, and between two commercially very important regions of Argentina, was the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel which joins the cities of Santa Fe and Paraná, about 120 kilometers (75 mi) north from Rosario. The southern Paraná is crossed by another cable-stayed bridge, the Zárate-Brazo Largo Bridge, joining Entre Ríos and Buenos Aires province.\n\n\n"}

The animatronic costumes used for the characters were created by Alchemy II, Inc., headed by Ken Forsse who later created Teddy Ruxpin. The show was first aired on April 18, 1983, the day The Disney Channel was launched. Its timeslot for its early run was at 8:30 a.m. Eastern/Pacific Time, making it the third program of The Disney Channel's 16 (later 18) hour programming day. Reruns of the show aired on The Disney Channel until May 30, 1997.\n\nHal Smith, Will Ryan, and Laurie Main were the only three actors from the original four Pooh shorts to reprise their roles here (Smith, who had voiced Owl ever since the beginning of Disney's Winnie the Pooh franchise, had recently replaced Sterling Holloway as the voice of Pooh; Ryan had provided Rabbit's voice in the 1983 short \"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\", replacing Junius Matthews; and Main was the narrator for \"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\", replacing Sebastian Cabot). The show's title derives from the second Winnie the Pooh storybook, \"The House at Pooh Corner\".\n\nThis series was the only incarnation in the history of Disney's incarnations of Winnie the Pooh in which we could actually see the narrator aside from only hearing his voice. He would present each episode. The show would start off with him greeting the viewers \"Welcome to Pooh Corner\" and then relate what he was talking about to an event that occurred in the Hundred Acre Wood, the home of the Pooh characters, and then he would proceed to read from a book entitled \"Welcome to Pooh Corner\". He would then narrate the episode acted out by the characters. The action was filmed before a blue screen, rather than using traditional sets (the same technique was used for \"Dumbo's Circus\", another live-action/puppet series that ran on The Disney Channel).\n\nSince the show was designed for The Disney Channel before it began airing commercials, there were no breaks for commercials. As a result, the show lasted a full thirty minutes. The main story ran about twenty minutes followed by two shorter segments. The first segment was a sing-along music video featuring one of nine songs, used over and over throughout the show's run. These songs were written by the Oscar-winning Sherman Brothers who had provided the majority of the Winnie the Pooh music over the years. The Sherman Brothers also wrote the show's theme song, using the music from the original Winnie-the-Pooh theme song from \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\", albeit with a slightly altered tempo.\n\nThe last segment of the show was a presentational arts and crafts demonstration that took place at the Thoughtful Spot. One of the cast members would speak to the narrator, looking directly into the camera, while they showed the viewers at home how to make something.\n\nWhen the series first started out, the narrator was seen sitting in a small library. As the series progressed, he is moved into a small playroom which eventually is seen having plush versions of Pooh and his friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe songs were written by the Academy Award-winning songwriting duo of Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The Sherman Brothers also wrote the majority of the well known Winnie the Pooh songs, including \"The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers\" and \"Heffalumps and Woozles\" from the 1960s, and in 2000 wrote the score to \"The Tigger Movie\".\n\n\nSometimes, if an episode ended a few minutes early, a certain character would sing a song entitled \"A Part of Me\", which was written by one of the voice actors, Phil Baron. The song depicts the importance of a certain body part that each character was singing about:\n\nSix VHS tapes were released by Walt Disney Home Video in the mid-1980s for the then new video home rental market. Each tape contained four episodes.\n\nThe show was also released on VHS PAL in the UK as part of a six-volume set which also each featured an episode of \"Good Morning, Mickey!\", \"Donald Duck Presents\", \"The Mouse Factory\" and \"Mousercise\". Each tape contained one episode of \"Welcome to Pooh Corner\".\n\n"}

He studied at the Collège Saint-Louis (1766).\n\nQuesnel joined the French merchant marine and sailed to Pondicherry and Madagascar, travelled in Africa, and the Caribbean. He engaged in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1768, as a second-lieutenant on board the \"Mesny\", he sailed to Cabinda (modern-day Angola) where 514 \"Blacks of all ages\" were purchased and taken to modern-day Haiti where they were sold, according to French archival sources quoted in a novel about him. He carried with him his violin and read the works of French playwrights.\n\nIn 1779, Quesnel sailed for New York in command of a French warship which was captured by the British. Quesnel was taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia and allowed to settle in Boucherville, near Montreal, Quebec. He married Marie-Josephte Deslandes there and became partners in business with Maurice-Régis Blondeau, his mother-in-law's new husband. He became wealthy by trading in slaves.\n\nQuesnel published a number of theatrical works, including \"Colas et Colinette\", which was written in 1788 and first performed in 1790, and \"Lucas et Cecile\"; he also wrote poetry; his best known poem was titled \"L'Épître à M. Labadie\".\n\nBesides several songs, he composed sacred music for the parish church of Montreal, and some motets, and wrote a short treatise on the dramatic art (1805). He founded and was part of the troupe of Montreal's Théàtre de Societé.\n\nHe died of pleurisy at Montreal in 1809 several months after he had dived into the Saint Lawrence River to save a drowning child.\n\nQuesnel was the subject of the comic opera \"Le Père des amours\", written by Eugène Lapierre in 1942.\n\nQuesnel's son Jules Maurice Quesnel travelled with Simon Fraser on his journey to the Pacific Ocean; the town of Quesnel, British Columbia is named for him. Another son Frédéric-Auguste became a lawyer and politician; his daughter Mélanie married lawyer Côme-Séraphin Cherrier.\n\n\n\n"}

Oldfield spent his childhood partly in Dublin and partly in Reading, Berkshire. He later attended Douai School a Benedictine monastery school and also spent a few terms at the Oratory School in Woodcote, Oxfordshire. His earliest musical experiences were in the myriad of folk clubs that sprang up in the UK during the late 1960s and early 1970s, listening to the songs of Leonard Cohen, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn and Bob Dylan.\n\nOldfield left school at 16 to travel the world and worked as a roadie for various bands including The Byrds. During an extended stay on the Greek island of Hydra, he took up his first musical instrument, the flute. \"I think it was learning to play in this way, with no formal guidance, that allowed me to develop the ability to compose music. I spent many happy days improvising tunes and discovering scales and arpeggios for myself, and soon started to teach myself to write these things down\". Terry's only formal music training was in Agra, India, where he spent some time learning to play the tabla.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Terry and his brother Mike formed a band called 'Barefoot' (or 'Barefeet') playing rock'n'roll at colleges and clubs throughout the UK. Mike later went on to record the highly successful \"Tubular Bells\" and Terry played the flute in the live performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, June 25, 1973, London.\n\nTerry also appears on Mike's albums \"Hergest Ridge\" (woodwind – uncredited), \"Ommadawn\" (pan-pipes) and extensively on \"Incantations\" (flute).\n\nTerry, his brother Mike and his sister Sally all completed the Exegesis Programme Large Group Awareness Training course. Terry recorded a piece of flute music which was used to accompany the last section of the course.\n\nOldfield's career began in earnest when he was asked by the BBC to compose music for a series called \"Great Railway Journeys of the World\". Since then Oldfield has composed music for over 50 film and TV productions, receiving two Emmy nominations for \"Land of the Tiger\" and \"Twilight of the Dreamtime\" and a BAFTA nomination for the BBC series \"Kingdom of the Ice Bear\". He also worked on Meerkats United, which in a National Television Poll was voted 'Best Wildlife Film Ever'.\n\nOldfield had a relationship with New World Music, one of the world's leading 'World' music labels, for over 10 years and has a back catalogue of over 15 recordings.

{"id": "1877499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877499", "title": "Gratis versus libre", "text": "Gratis versus libre\n\nThe English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: \"for free\" (\"gratis\") and \"with little or no restriction\" (\"libre\"). This ambiguity of \"free\" can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents.\n\nThe terms \"gratis\" and \"libre\" may be used to categorise intellectual property, particularly computer programs, according to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them, in the free software and open source communities, as well as the broader free culture movement. For example, they are used to distinguish freeware (software \"gratis\") from free software (software \"libre\").\n\nRichard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan: \"Think free as in free speech, not free beer.\"\n\n\"Gratis\" in English is adopted from the various Romance and Germanic languages, ultimately descending from the plural ablative and dative form of the first-declension noun \"grātia\" in Latin. It means \"free\" in the sense that some goods or service is supplied without need for payment, even though it may have value.\n\n\"Libre\" in English is adopted from the various Romance languages, ultimately descending from the Latin word \"līber\"; its origin is closely related to \"liberty\". It denotes \"the state of being free\", as in \"liberty\" or \"having freedom\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) considers \"libre\" to be obsolete, but the word has come back into limited use. Unlike \"gratis\", \"libre\" appears in few English dictionaries, although there is no other English single-word adjective signifying \"liberty\" exclusively, without also meaning \"at no monetary cost\".\n\nIn software development, where the cost of mass production is relatively small, it is common for developers to make software available at no cost. One of the early and basic forms of this model is called freeware. With freeware, software is licensed freely for regular use: the developer does not gain any monetary compensation.\n\nWith the advent of the free software movement, license schemes were created to give developers more freedom in terms of code sharing, commonly called open source or free and open-source software (called FLOSS, FOSS, or F/OSS). As the English adjective \"free\" does not distinguish between \"for free\" and \"liberty\", the phrases \"free as in freedom of speech\" (\"libre\", free software) and \"free as in free beer\" (\"gratis\", freeware) were adopted. Many in the free software movement feel strongly about the \"freedom\" to use the software, make modifications, etc., whether or not this freely usable software is to be exchanged for money. Therefore, this distinction became important.\n\nThese phrases have become common, along with \"gratis\" and \"libre\", in the software development and computer law fields for encapsulating this distinction. The distinction is similar to the distinction made in political science between positive liberty and negative liberty. Like \"free beer\", positive liberty promises equal access by all without cost or regard to income, of a given good (assuming the good exists). Like \"free speech\", negative liberty safeguards the right to use of something (in this case, speech) without regard to whether in each case there is a cost involved for this use (you still have free speech even though it costs money to acquire a newspaper).\n\nIn order to reflect real-world differences in the degree of open access, the distinction between gratis open access and libre open access was added in 2006 by Peter Suber and Stevan Harnad, two of the co-drafters of the original Budapest Open Access Initiative definition of open access publishing. Gratis open access refers to online access free of charge (which Wikipedia indicates with the icon ), and libre open access refers to online access free of charge plus some additional re-use rights (Wikipedia icon ). Libre open access is equivalent to the definition of open access in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific Creative Commons licenses; these almost all require attribution of authorship to the original authors.\n\nThe original gratis/libre distinction concerns software (i.e., code), with which users can potentially do two kinds of things: 1. access and use it; and 2. modify and re-use it. \"Gratis\" pertains to being to access and use the code, without a price-barrier, while \"libre\" pertains to being to modify and re-use the code, without a permission barrier. The target content of the open access movement, however, is not software but published, peer-reviewed research journal article texts.\n\n1. Source code accessibility and use. For published research articles, the case for making their text accessible free for all online (Gratis) is even stronger than it is for software code, because in the case of software, some developers may wish to give their code away for free, while others may wish to sell it, whereas in the case of published research article texts, \"all\" their authors, without exception, give them away for free: None seek or get royalties or fees from their sale. On the contrary, any access-denial to potential users means loss of potential research impact (downloads, citations) for the author's research—and researcher-authors' employment, salary, promotion and funding depends in part on the uptake and impact of their research.\n\n2. Source code modifiability and re-use. For published research articles, the case for allowing text modification and re-use is much weaker than for software code, because, unlike software, the \"text\" of a research article is not intended for modification and re-use. (In contrast, the \"content\" of research articles is and always was intended for modification and re-use: that is how research progresses.) There are no copyright barriers to modifying, developing, building upon and re-using an author's ideas and findings, once they have been published, as long as the author and published source are credited—but modifications to the published text are another matter. Apart from verbatim quotation, scholarly/scientific authors are not in general interested in allowing other authors to create \"mashups\" of their texts. Researcher-authors are all happy to make their texts available for harvesting and indexing for search as well as data-mining, but not for re-use in altered form (without the permission of the author).\n\nThe formal analogy between open software and open access has been made, along with the generalization of the gratis/libre distinction from the one field to the other.\n\n\n"}

It is the former cathedral mother church of the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown — proto-cathedral means the former cathedral of a see that has transferred or moved. During its years as a cathedral, the pastor was Benedict Joseph Flaget, the first Bishop of Bardstown.\n\nThe cornerstone was laid on July 16, 1816, with construction beginning thereafter. Materials used for its construction were found in the immediate area. The architect and builder was John Rogers of Baltimore. By 1819 it was sufficiently completed for Mass to be held. The interior was fully complete by 1823. Many of the paintings and interior decorations were donated by Pope Leo XII, King Louis-Philippe of France and others. The gift from the King of France included paintings by Murillo, Van Dyke and others. Gifts of royal embroidered vestments—the handwork of the queen and her court—and sacramental vessels were also made.\n\n\nOn November 12, 1952, nine of the paintings were stolen. Thieves entered the church in the middle of the night and cut the paintings from their frames. The stolen paintings were: “The Flaying of St. Bartholomew,” “The Coronation,” “The Descent of the Holy Ghost,” “St. Anne,” “The Blessed Virgin,” and four Stations of the Cross. The paintings were recovered by the F.B.I. in April of 1953. Four were found rolled up in the trunk of a car in Chicago, and five had been purchased by a New York buyer. The paintings remained in good condition. Twelve men were arrested in connection with the robbery, but only one, Norton Kretske, was sentenced. His conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to lack of evidence. The paintings were returned in 1957 and were rehung in the church in 1958.\n\nThe Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew, Mattia Preti, was painted in Naples around 1650. In the early 19th century, King Francis I of the Two Sicilies made a gift of the picture to the Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral in Bardstown, Kentucky, where it remains to this day. After suffering many years of neglect and misguided restorations (including complete over-painting of the surface in the 1950s), the picture was sent to the Getty for study and development of a plan for treatment. Two years of difficult work have restored the picture, and the exceptional character and quality of the original is once again visible. The painting was returned to Bardstown in time for re-consecration of the Proto-Cathedral as a Basilica in August, 2002.\n\nThe proto-cathedral is the first Catholic Cathedral west of the Allegheny Mountains. On January 9, 1974, the proto-cathedral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On June 3, 1976, the listing was expanded to include the adjacent Spalding Hall and Flaget Hall, originally St. Joseph College.\n\nOver time, the location of the cornerstone was lost, until 1980 when it was uncovered during restoration of part of the building.\n\nOn July 18, 2001, Pope John Paul II elevated it to the honor of a minor basilica church and an umbraculum was installed at the altar.\n\nThe Diocese of Bardstown was erected into an Episcopal See April 8, 1808 by the Holy See. This diocese was the first inland diocese in the United States. The primal see or proto-Diocese of the United States, the Diocese of Baltimore, was subdivided into the dioceses of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Bardstown (Baltimore becoming the Archdiocese of Baltimore).\n\nThe See of the diocese of Bardstown was moved to Louisville in 1841, and St. Joseph's was replaced as Cathedral by St. Louis Church (now the Cathedral of the Assumption) on Fifth Street in Downtown Louisville. St. Joseph's therefore became the \"proto\" or first cathedral. The Diocese of Louisville was elevated to Archdiocese in 1939.\n\nIn 1995, the Holy See honored the proto-cathedral by naming retired Bishop Charles G. Maloney, the Titular Bishop of Bardstown. Maloney died on April 30, 2006. He was succeeded by Bishop Daniel E. Thomas on June 8, 2006.\n\n\n"}

The writing of the album involved several months of jam sessions and recording at Guilford House, a secluded country estate located in Guilford, Connecticut. \n\nThe album's recording sessions took place from January to February 1995 at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia. The band worked with the engineer Don Zientara, but did not choose to work with the producer Ted Niceley again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of \"In on the Kill Taker\" and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater depth. To achieve this, the band handled the production themselves and, in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. This is evident in the incorporation of short, sampled segues, (\"Do You Like Me\", \"Birthday Pony\"), instruments such as the clarinet (as heard on \"Version\"), and alternate tunings used on songs such as \"Latest Disgrace\" and \"By You\". Footage of the band both writing and recording the album can be seen in the film \"Instrument\".\n\nThe album was a critical success: Mark Kemp of \"Rolling Stone\" called the album \"rock solid\". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote, \"With more drive and playful goings-on, the arrangements sound much looser than on \"Kill Taker\", while remaining just as gut-kicking and brainy.\" \n\n\"Pitchfork\" put the album at number 42 in its \"Top 100 Albums of the 90s\".\n\nFugazi embarked on an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, performing a total of 172 dates between March 1995 and November 1996.\n\nBoth Refused and No Knife covered \"Bed for the Scraping\".

{"id": "1877510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877510", "title": "Multiple cloning site", "text": "Multiple cloning site\n\nA multiple cloning site (MCS), also called a polylinker, is a short segment of DNA which contains many (up to ~20) restriction sites - a standard feature of engineered plasmids. Restriction sites within an MCS are typically unique, occurring only once within a given plasmid. The purpose of a MCS in a plasmid is to allow a piece of DNA to be inserted into that region. A MCS is found in a variety of vectors, including cloning vectors to increase the number of copies of target DNA, and in expression vectors to create a protein product. In expression vectors, the MCS is located downstream of the promoter.\n\nIn some instances, a vector may not contain a MCS. Rather, a MCS can be added to a vector. The first step is designing complementary oligonucleotide sequences that contain restriction enzyme sites along with additional bases on the end that are complementary to the vector after digesting. Then the oligonucleotide sequences can be annealed and ligated into the digested and purified vector. The digested vector is cut with a restriction enzyme that complements the oligonucleotide insert overhangs. After ligation, transform the vector into bacteria and verify the insert by sequencing. This method can also be used to add new restriction sites to a multiple cloning site.\n\nMultiple cloning sites are a feature that allows for the insertion of foreign DNA without disrupting the rest of the plasmid which makes it extremely useful in biotechnology, bioengineering, and molecular genetics. MCS can aid in making transgenic organisms, more commonly known as a genetically modified organism (GMO) using genetic engineering. To take advantage of the MCS in genetic engineering, a gene of interest has to be added to the vector during production when the MCS is cut open. After the MCS is made and ligated it will include the gene of interest and can be amplified to increase gene copy number in a bacterium-host. After the bacterium replicates, the gene of interest can be extracted out of the bacterium. In some instances, an expression vector can be used to create a protein product. After the products are isolated, they have a wide variety of uses such as the production of insulin, the creation of vaccines, production of antibiotics, and creation of gene therapies.\nOne bacterial plasmid used in genetic engineering as a plasmid cloning vector is pUC18. Its polylinker region is composed of several restriction enzyme recognition sites, that have been engineered into a single cluster (the polylinker). It has restriction sites for various restriction enzymes, including EcoRI, BamHI, and PstI. Another vector used in genetic engineering is pUC19, which is similar to pUC18, but its polylinker region is reversed. \"E.coli\" is also commonly used as the bacterial host because of the availability, quick growth rate, and versatility.\n\nIn order to genetically engineer insulin, the first step is to cut the MCS in the plasmid being used. Once the MCS is cut, the gene for human insulin can be added making the plasmid genetically modified. After that, the genetically modified plasmid is put into the bacterial host and allowed to divide. To make the large supply that is demanded, the host cells are put into a large fermentation tank that is an optimal environment for the host. The process is finished by filtering out the insulin from the host. Purification can then take place so the insulin can be packaged and distributed to individuals with diabetes.\n"}

He raced in seven editions of the Tour, finishing five, and gained a reputation for his ability to suffer over long mountain stages.\n\nBorn on 7 June 1956 in Widnes, Lancashire, Sherwen was brought up in Kenya, where his father ran a factory which produced fertiliser, paint and insecticides. He started his sporting life as a swimmer, finishing second in the under-14 Kenyan swimming championship. Upon returning to Britain, he won the regional under-18 championship for Runcorn and District. However, at 16, he turned to cycling and rode for the Weaver Valley CC in Cheshire, receiving guidance from Manchester coach Harold Nelson, and trained regularly with other local riders destined for professional careers, notably Graham Jones, John Herety and Ian Binder.\n\nAt 19, riding for Altrincham Road Club, he won the season-long Star Trophy series in 1976, winning the Manx International and the Archer Pernod GP and two stages in the Tour of Malago.\n\nA year later, he won Folkestone-London, attacking from the gun. For the French team ACBB (Athletic Club Boulogne Billancourt) he won Paris-Barentin, Paris-Mauberge and the Tour de l'Essone, was third in the amateur Paris–Roubaix and second in the British championship. He won the Archer Grand Prix cycle race in 1976 and 1977. Despite spending only part of the year in France due to examinations, he came second in the season-long Palme d'Or competition. 1977 saw him ride the world championship in Venezuela, the pro-am Étoile des Éspoirs and the Scottish Milk Race. Upon leaving ACBB he was invited to nominate a rider as his successor at the club, becoming the first of a chain of English-speaking riders who graduated to the highest level of the sport via the club, including Irishman Stephen Roche, fellow Britons Robert Millar (now known as Philippa York) and Sean Yates, and Australian Phil Anderson. He then turned professional in 1978 for Fiat under Raphaël Géminiani, and later rode as a domestique in the La Redoute cycling team.\n\nHe finished 70th in the 1978 Tour de France. In 1980, he came close to being eliminated on the third stage of the Tour. He finished outside the cut-off time (a percentage of the winner’s time), but was reinstated in view of his solo chase after a crash. The reinstatement delayed abandonment, and he was to repeat the process six years later.\n\nSherwen was 19th and 11th in Milan–San Remo in 1979 and 1980 respectively, and 15th in the 1984 Paris–Roubaix. He finished third in the Tour du Haut Var, won by Sean Kelly, in 1982, following a stage win in the season-opening Tour of the Mediterranean. He came second in the Four Days of Dunkirk in 1983, winning a stage. He won the Grand Prix de Denain.\n\nIn the Tour, Sherwen finished 111th in 1982 and 116th in 1984. During the last mountain stage of 1984, he diced with the cut-off time. Riding with Australian cyclist Allan Peiper towards the summit at La Plagne, Peiper was knocked from his bike by a Dutch enthusiast. Sherwen – aware of the cut-off – told him to get back on his bike and they crossed the line just inside the limit.\n\nOn the first day in the mountains of the 1985 Tour de France, Sherwen crashed in the first kilometre before the race had left Épinal. With Bernard Hinault setting a fast pace, Sherwen had little chance to regain the other riders. He rode solo for six hours over six mountains, accompanied by a motorcycle outrider, and was over an hour behind the stage winner, and 23 minutes outside the cut-off – the Tour publicity caravan had started its return journey and had to move to one side to allow Sherwen to complete the stage. However, again, his courage and endurance were rewarded by reinstatement – he was able to continue and went on to finish this Tour which would be his last.\n\nSherwen joined Raleigh in 1986 alongside Mark Bell, Paul Watson, Jon Clay and Jeff Williams. He retired after two seasons winning the British road race championship in 1987 his final season. He then managed the Banana-Raleigh team until Raleigh pulled out at the end of 1989. During this time, he worked as a co-commentator with Phil Liggett for Channel 4's coverage of the Tour de France, with the pair making their debut together on the Tour in 1986. After Banana-Raleigh, Sherwen worked as the Public Relations Director for the American Motorola Cycling Team. He was also considered for the position of Performance Director at British Cycling in 1997, but lost out to Peter Keen.\n\nUp until the conclusion of the 2016 Tour de France, Sherwen provided the commentary broadcast internationally for many television networks including Australia's SBS Network and the United States' NBC Sports with Phil Liggett. Sherwen lived in Kampala, Uganda: he had interests in a gold mine in Busitema, and commuted between Uganda and the United States regularly. Sherwen and Liggett then commentated for NBC Sports only.\n\nSherwen died of heart failure on 2 December 2018 at his home in Kampala, Uganda, at the age of 62. He is survived by his wife Katherine and their two children Margaux and Alexander.\n"}

Versions of it have been associated with the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as MIT and various universities, and is now often performed by the MIT a cappella group The Chorallaries. In many university engineering faculties, military engineering corps and other engineering organizations and societies, Lady Godiva is a school icon or mascot.\n\nGodiva's Hymn is sung either to the tune of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" or \"The Son of a Gambolier\". Near Christmas, it is a tradition of the Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad (sic) of the University of Toronto to sing Godiva's Hymn to the tune of Good King Wenceslaus.\n\nOne Version of the Chorus is as follows:\n\n<poem>We are We are We are We are--\nWe are the engineers--\nWe can We can We can We can--\nDemolish forty beers--\nDrink rum Drink rum Drink rum all day--\nand come along with us for--\nWe don't give a damn for any old man--\nWho don't give a damn for us--</poem>\n\nFive of Godiva's Verses:\n\n<poem>Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride--\nTo show to all the villagers her fine and lily-white hide--\nThe most observant villager, an engineer of course--\nWas the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse--</poem>\n\n<poem>Professors put demands on us, they say we have to tool,--\nBut all we want to do is sleep, we hate this fucking school.--\nYou can bitch or tell us off, even abuse us if you please,--\nBut we're all set to graduate, and all we need are C's!-- </poem>\n\n<poem>Venus is a statue made entirely of stone,--\nThere's not a fig leaf on her, she's as naked as a bone.--\nOn noticing her arms were gone, an Engineer discoursed,--\n\"The damn thing's busted concrete and it should be reinforced.\"--</poem>\n\n<poem>An Engineer once came to class so drunk and very late,--\nHe stumbled through the lecture hall at an ever-diminishing rate.--\nThe only things that held him up and kept him on his course,--\nWere the boundary condition and the electromotive force.-- </poem>\n\n<poem>An Engineer from UBC once found the gates of Hell,--\nThey looked the devil in the eye and said, \"You're looking well.\"--\nSatan just returned the glare and said, \"Why visit me?--\nYou've been through Hell already, you went to UBC!\"--</poem>\n\nThis is not a variant on Godiva’s hymn.

He formed a tag team with his \"brother\" Gene Anderson and also tagged with his other \"brother\" Ole Anderson. Anderson was only the real last name for Gene Anderson . Ole and Lars had changed their names to pretend to be the real life brothers of Gene . He occasionally wrestled with them as the Minnesota Wrecking Crew. Lars did not have the success that the other Andersons had. He did win numerous NWA regional championships, however, including winning the Georgia version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Gene Anderson. Lars wrestled briefly in the Carolinas as \"Luscious\" Lars Anderson.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he wrestled in the San Francisco bay area (again as Luscious Lars Anderson), winning the NWA (San Francisco) World Tag Team title with partner Paul DeMarco in 1972.\n\nOn the microphone, Larry was one of the best talkers in an era when getting over on the microphone was important. In the early '70s, after leaving Gene Anderson, he returned to the AWA and hooked up with Larry \"Pretty Boy\" Hennig. The latter needed a new partner after the departure of \"Handsome\" Harley Race who ventured to the NWA.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Heiniemi was joined by his college friend, Les \"Budd\" Wolfe. Together they formed a solid combination, and many felt they should have won the AWA World Tag Team titles. In March 1975, Heiniemi announced he was retiring from the ring, and after losing his last match to England's Billy Robinson, Larry left the AWA. However, he did not retire; he was back to using the Lars Anderson handle and briefly feuded with his \"brothers\" Gene and Ole in Atlanta in 1977.\n\nHe spent the last years of his career wrestling in Hawaii for Polynesian Pacific Wrestling (PPW). When its owner, Peter Maivia, died in 1982, his wife hired Heiniemi as head booker. This lasted until 1988 when the dwindling promotion folded. Dwayne Johnson, former wrestler and grandson of Peter Maivia, spoke poorly of Heiniemi in his 2000 autobiography, \"The Rock Says...\".

He was also the first major exponent of Swadeshi values in Indian art, thereby founding the influential Bengal school of art, which led to the development of modern Indian painting He was also a noted writer, particularly for children. Popularly known as 'Aban Thakur', his books \"Rajkahini, Budo Angla, Nalak,\" and \"Khirer Putul\" are landmarks in Bengali language children's literature and art.\n\nTagore sought to modernise Mughal and Rajput styles to counter the influence of Western models of art, as taught in art schools under the British Raj. Along with other artists from the Bengal school of art, Tagore advocated for a nationalistic Indian art derived from Indian art history, drawing inspiration from the Ajanta Caves. Tagore's work was so successful that it was eventually accepted and promoted as a national Indian style within British art institutions.\n\nAbanindranath Tagore was born in Jorasanko, Calcutta, British India, to Gunendranath Tagore and Saudamini Tagore. His grandfather was Girindranath Tagore, the second son of \"Prince\" Dwarkanath Tagore. He was a member of the distinguished Tagore family, and a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore. His grandfather and his elder brother, Gaganendranath Tagore, were also artists.\n\nTagore learned art when studying at Sanskrit College, Kolkata in the 1880s. \n\nIn 1890, around the age of twenty years, Abanindranath attended the Calcutta School of Art where he learnt to use pastels from O. Ghilardi, and oil painting from C. Palmer, European painters who taught in that institution.\n\nIn 1889, he married Suhasini Devi, daughter of Bhujagendra Bhusan Chatterjee, a descendant of Prasanna Coomar Tagore. At this time he left the Sanskrit College after nine years of study and studied English as a special student at St. Xavier's College, which he attended for about a year and a half.\n\nHe had a sister, Sunayani Devi.\n\nIn the early 1890s several illustrations were published in \"Sadhana\" magazine, and in Chitrangada, and other works by Rabindranath Tagore. He also illustrated his own books.About the year 1897 he took lessons from the vice-principal of the Government School of Art, studying in the traditional European academic manner, learning the full range of techniques, but with a particular interest in watercolour. At this time he began to come under the influence of Mughal art, making a number of works based on the life of Krishna in a Mughal-influenced style. After meeting E. B. Havell, Tagore worked with him to revitalise and redefine art teaching at the Calcutta School of art, a project also supported by his brother Gaganendranath, who set up the Indian Society of Oriental Art.\n\nTagore believed in the traditional Indian techniques of painting. His philosophy rejected the \"materialistic\" art of the west and came back to Indian traditional art forms. He was influenced by the Mughal school of painting as well as Whistler's Aestheticism. In his later works, Tagore started integrating Chinese and Japanese calligraphic traditions into his style.\n\nTagore believed that Western art was \"materialistic\" in character, and that India needed to return to its own traditions to recover spiritual values. Despite its Indocentric nationalism, this view was already commonplace within British art of the time, stemming from the ideas of the Pre-Raphaelites. Tagore's work also shows the influence of Whistler's Aestheticism. Partly for this reason many British arts administrators were sympathetic to such ideas, especially as Hindu philosophy was becoming increasingly influential in the West following the spread of the Theosophy movement. Tagore believed that Indian traditions could be adapted to express these new values, and to promote a progressive Indian national culture.\n\nHis finest achievement however was the Arabian Night's series which was painted in 1930. In these paintings he uses the Arabian Nights stories as a trope for looking at colonial Calcutta and picturing its emergent cosmopolitanism.\n\nWith the success of Tagore's ideas, he came into contact with other Asian cultural figures, such as the Japanese art historian Okakura Kakuzō and the Japanese painter Yokoyama Taikan, whose work was comparable to his own. In his later work, he began to incorporate elements of Chinese and Japanese calligraphic traditions into his art, seeking to construct a model for a modern pan-Asian artistic tradition which would merge the common aspects of Eastern spiritual and artistic culture.\n\nHis close students included Nandalal Bose, Samarendranath Gupta, Kshitindranath Majumdar, Surendranath Ganguly, Asit Kumar Haldar, Sarada Ukil, Kalipada Ghoshal , Manishi Dey, Mukul Dey, K. Venkatappa and Ranada Ukil.\n\nFor Abanindranath, the house he grew up in (5 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane) and its companion house (6 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane) connected two cultural worlds – 'white town' (where the British colonizers lived) and 'black town' (where the natives lived). According to architectural historian Swati Chattopadhay, Abanindranath \"used the Bengali meaning of the word, Jorasanko – 'double bridge' to develop this idea in the form of a mythical map of the city. The map is, indeed, not of Calcutta, but an imaginary city, Halisahar, and is the central guide in a children's story Putur Boi (Putu's Book). The nineteenth-century place names of Calcutta, however, appear on this map, thus suggesting we read this imaginary city with the colonial city as a frame of reference. The map uses the structure of a board game—golokdham—and shows a city divided along a main artery; on one side a lion-gate leads to the Lal-Dighi in the middle of which is the 'white island.'\n\nAbanindranath maintained throughout his life a long friendship with the London-based artist, author, and eventual president of London's Royal College of Art William Rothenstein. Arriving in the autumn of 1910, Rothenstein spent almost a year surveying India's cultural and religious sites, including the ancient Buddhist caves of Ajanta; the Jain carvings of Gwalior; and the Hindu panoply of Benares. He ended up in Calcutta, where he drew and painted with Abanindranath and his students, attempting to absorb elements of Bengal School style into his own practice.\n\nHowever limited Rothenstein's experiments with the styles of early Modernist Indian painting were, the friendship between him and Abanindranath ushered in a crucial cultural event. This was Rabindranath Tagore's sojourn at Rothenstein's London home, which led to the publication of the English-language version of Gitanjali and the subsequent award to Rabindranath in 1913 of the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nThe publication of Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali in English brought the Tagore family international renown, which helped to make Abanindranath's artistic projects better known in the west.\n\nAbanindranath became chancellor of Visva Bharati in 1942.\n\nWithin a few years of the artist's death in 1951, his eldest son, Alokendranath, bequeathed almost the entire family collection of Abanindranath Tagore's paintings to the newly founded Rabindra Bharati Society Trust that took up residence on the site of their famous house on No. 5, Dwarakanath Tagore lane. In a situation where only a small number of the artist's paintings had been collected or given away in his lifetime, the Rabindra Bharati Society became the main repository of Abanindranath's works of all periods. Banished into trunks inside the dark offices of the society, these paintings have remained in permanent storage ever since. Caught in these many binds the full range and brilliance of Abanindranath's works could never be effectively projected into a public domain. They remained intimately known only to a tiny circle of Art connoisseurs and scholars in Bengal – some of whom like K. G. Subramanyan and R. Siva Kumar have long argued that the true measure of Abanindranath's talent is to be found in his works of the 1920s, 30s and 40s but could do little to offer up a comprehensive profile of the master for the contemporary art world. R. Siva Kumar's Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore (2008) is a path-breaking discovery in re-defining Abanindranath's art.\n\nA list of paintings by Abanindranath Tagore:\n\n\n"}

The speaker is most commonly provided with their topic in the form of a quotation, but the topic may also be presented as an object, proverb, one-word abstract, or one of the many alternative possibilities. While specific rules and norms vary with the organization and level of competition, the speeches tend to follow basic speech format and cover topics that are both humorous and profound.\n\nImpromptu speaking is an individual event offered and regulated by both the National Forensics Association and the American Forensics Association, both of whom follow nearly identical formats in proctoring the event. Both organizations provide seven minutes of time to be allocated between speaking and preparation as the speaker sees fit, allow minimal notes (usually a 3\"x5\" index card) to be used, and provide undisclosed prompts to determine the speech's topic.\n\nWhile the competitor's success and ranking is ultimately determined by the judge's decision, there are several general criteria that many competitors and judges adhere to:\n\nNeither the AFA nor NFA regulate specific speech formats to be used by competitors, however there are two formats that are predominantly used:\n\nTwo point format:\n\nThree point format:\n\nIn 2008, the National Forensics Association officially introduced a new form of impromptu for competition. In this event students are given a short editorial (ideally 3 to 5 paragraphs) to which they will develop a response. Students will be allowed nine minutes to divide between preparation and speech time. Speakers must speak for at least five minutes. Limited notes, prepared in the round, are permitted. Editorial Impromptu represents an attempt to return “impromptu” to impromptu speaking. The speech should involve the development of an argument in response to the thesis developed or opinion shared in a given editorial.\n\nTypically in high school speech competitions, a competitor is given 30 seconds to select a topic from a set of topics (usually three). The competitor will then have 5 minutes to compose a speech of five minutes with a 30-second grace period. There is a general outline for impromptu speeches, it is as follows:\n\n\nThe introduction begins with an attention-getter, the statement of the topic and an outline of the speech. The conclusion is usually like the introduction except backwards, ending with a profound statement, although a lighthearted ending is also accepted. For the three body points, there are many kinds of formats that can be used. For example, if the topic is a quote, a competitor may go over how the quote is true, how the quote is false, and why he or she believes what he or she believes. Other examples are: past, present, future; local, national, international. More advanced speakers will use formats that look deeper into a subject such as: physical, moral, intellectual; books, video, digital (media.)\n\nHowever, many speakers choose not to follow a format at all. That being said, most beginners who fail to follow a solid format often find themselves lost in a jumble of ideas.\n\nJudging usually involves one judge in the preliminary round, one to three judges in the semi-finals/qualifying round, and a panel of three judges in the finals round. Judges look for overall coherency, impact, and confidence, and usually overlook basal errors due to the short preparation time.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877559", "title": "Don Messer", "text": "Don Messer\n\nDonald Charles Frederick \"Don\" Messer (May 9, 1909 – March 26, 1973) was a Canadian musician, band leader, radio broadcaster, and defining icon of folk music during the 1960s. His CBC Television series \"Don Messer’s Jubilee\" (1959–69) featured Messer's down-east fiddle style and the \"old-time\" music of Don Messer and His Islanders, and was one of the most popular and enduring Canadian television programs of the 1960s. Messer was known as a shy fiddler, who preferred to have the other members of the band take the spotlight.\n\nBorn in Tweedside, New Brunswick, Don Messer was the youngest of 11 children to John and Margaret Agnes (Moffitt) Messer. He began playing the violin at age five, learning fiddle tunes with Irish and Scottish influences. By the age of seven he was playing fiddle for square dances. As a young boy, Messer would play concerts in the local area and later throughout southwestern New Brunswick.\n\nBy the time he was a young man he had amassed a repertoire of hundreds of reels, jigs, breakdowns, and other pieces for fiddle. He was playing endless square dances, country dances, weddings, and other parties. At age 16 he moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he received his only formal instruction in music. He moved back to New Brunswick in March, 1929.\n\nHe was married to Naomi Dorothy Gray on the 28th of July, 1934 in Lancaster Parish, Saint John, New Brunswick.\n\nHe died of a heart attack in 1973 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A monument was erected in his memory in Tweedside, New Brunswick. A fiddle also stands in Harvey, New Brunswick as a monument.\n\nMesser began his radio career on CFBO in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1929 when he joined the station staff. He had organized a small studio band of musicians by that point and in 1934, they began a regular radio show for the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (forerunner to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or CBC), broadcasting from CHSJ in Saint John under the name the \"New Brunswick Lumberjacks\". Messer also began to make personal appearances throughout the Maritimes and New England using a smaller group named the \"Backwoods Breakdown.\" Messer left Saint John in 1939 and moved to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island where he joined CFCY as music director.\n\nWhile in Charlottetown, Messer formed the \"Islanders\" and by 1944 the group was airing a show nationally on CBC radio. The show established itself as the most popular on Canadian radio during the 1940s-1960s and \"Don Messer and The Islanders\" began to tour outside of the Maritimes. It was formed around two of the original members, lumberjack-vocalist Charlie Chamberlain from Bathurst, N.B., and bass player Julius (Duke) Neilson from Woodstock, N.B. Other members were added throughout the years and Don Messer and the Islanders was later changed to Don Messer and His Islanders. The band remained together after the late 1930s. The musicians provided a backdrop for vocalists, guest performers and, after 1959, the Buchta Dancers. Charlie Chamberlain and Marg Osburne were the lead vocalists.\n\nIn 1956, Messer's music group began to make regular television appearances on CBHT-TV in Halifax, Nova Scotia. CBC television began a summer series called \"The Don Messer Show\" on August 7, 1959, which continued into the fall as \"Don Messer's Jubilee\", produced out of Halifax. Continuing as \"Don Messer's Jubilee\" throughout the 1960s, the show won a wide audience and reportedly became the second-most watched television show in Canada during the decade (next to \"Hockey Night in Canada\"). The show was notable because it had a regular guest performer time slot, giving rise to many important Canadian folk singers through their national exposure, including Stompin' Tom Connors and Catherine McKinnon, and fiddler Graham Townsend among many others including a young 10 year old fiddler named Jim Elliott.\n\n\"Don Messer's Jubilee\" was cancelled by CBC television in April 1969, raising a national protest among viewers and fans and even raising questions from the floor of the House of Commons. At the time the show was dropped, it still rated in the top 10 and the network was not specific about its reasons for dropping the show. The audience protest came particularly from the Maritimes and from thousands of Maritimers living in other parts of Canada, including former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was a fan of the show. Messer and his band continued \"Don Messer's Jubilee\" in syndication on CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario following the 1969 CBC cancellation until Messer's death four years later.\n\nMesser's television show became the subject of the National Film Board feature \"Don Messer: His Land and His Music\" in 1971 and CBC produced a commemorative video of the show in 1985.\n\nMesser died in Halifax and his library and papers are held by the Public Archives of Nova Scotia. One of his fiddles is now located at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee, although he always claimed that his folk music was neither country, nor western - the Irish and Scottish-influenced fiddle tunes having pre-dated the country/western genre by several hundred years.\n\nDon Messer's estate, which is run by his daughter Dawn Attis, has attempted to protect his name and image and his music. The estate gave sole license to contemporary Canadian folk musician Frank Leahy, who also owns and performs with one of Messer's fiddles. He received the honorary violin in 1997. Leahy recorded a tribute on Don Messer for the CBC and created a full-length stage production on \"Don Messer's Violin,\" which was presented across Canada. In the production, the role of Messer vocalist Marg Osborne was played by Catherine MacKinnon and Leahy played the role of Messer.\n\nA fiddle purchased by Messer in 1930 for $150 sold at an auction on July 23, 2006 for $11,750 to a resident of St. Stephen, New Brunswick. The fiddle was a copy of an instrument made by luthier Antonio Stradivari from the late 1600s. Messer owned 14 fiddles in his lifetime.\n\nA plaque to recognize the former home of Don Messer was installed by the City of Charlottetown to commemorate his contribution and presence in the community. The home is located on Belmont St. in Charlottetown and was built in 1950. Messer bought the home in 1960 and lived there for several years.\n\n\n\n"}

It codes for an isozyme of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK).\n\nPyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a part of a mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and is one of the major enzymes responsible for the regulation of homeostasis of carbohydrate fuels in mammals. The enzymatic activity is regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle. Phosphorylation of PDH by a specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) results in inactivation.\n\nThe mature protein encoded by the PDK4 gene contains 407 amino acids in its sequence. To form the active protein, two of the polypeptide chains come together to form an open conformation. The catalytic domain of PDK1 might exist separately in cells and important for the regulation of the PDK1 substrate. The crystal structural studies suggest that the PIF-pocket is located at the catalytic domain as well.\n\nThe Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH) complex must be tightly regulated due to its central role in general metabolism. Within the complex, there are three serine residues on the E1 component that are sites for phosphorylation; this phosphorylation inactivates the complex. In humans, there have been four isozymes of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase that have been shown to phosphorylate these three sites: PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4. PDK1 is the only enzyme capable of phosphorylating the 3rd serine site. When the thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPP) coenzyme is bound, the rates of phosphorylation by all four isozymes are drastically affected; specifically, the incorporation of phosphate groups by PDK1 into sites 2 and 3 is significantly reduced.\n\nAs the primary regulators of a crucial step in the central metabolic pathway, the pyruvate dehydrogenase family is tightly regulated itself by a myriad of factors. PDK activity has been shown to decrease in individuals consuming a diet that is high in n-3 fatty acids; however, PDH activity remained unaffected. Additionally, PDK1 is inihibited by AZD7545 and dichloroacetic acid (DCA); the mechanism was discovered to be the trifluoromethylpropanamide end of AZD7545 projecting into the lipoyl-binding pocket of PDK1. Dichloroacetic acid was found near the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of PDK1. Bound DCA promotes local conformational changes that are communicated to both nucleotide-binding and lipoyl-binding pockets of PDK1, leading to the inactivation of kinase activity.\n\nPDK1 is relevant in a variety of clinical conditions throughout the body. As PDK1 regulates the PDH complex, it has been proven to be an important regulator in certain cells, including the beta cells within the islets of the pancreas. In order to optimize glucose-stimulated insulin secretion\n(GSIS), a primary function of the pancreas, a low PDK1 activity must be maintained to keep PDH in a dephosphorylated and active state.\nMaintaining low PDK1 levels has also proven to be beneficial in certain regions of the brain, as it confers a high tolerance to amyloid beta, a metabolite that is directly correlated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe ubiquitous role of this gene lends itself to being involved in a variety of disease pathologies, including cancer. PDK1 mRNA expression is significantly associated with tumor progression; in fact, the presence of PDK1 can serve as a prognostic marker, indicating the level of success a patient can achieve. Specifically, this may serve as a biomarker in patients with gastric cancer. In coordination, the inhibitor dichloroacetic acid may be used in the future as a treatment option for patients with this type of cancer. PDK1, as it regulates hypoxia and lactate production, is associated with a poor outcome in patients with head and neck squamous cancer. The buildup of glycolytic metabolites may promote Hypoxia-Inducing Factor (HIF) activation, which creates a feed-forward loop for malignancy progression. As such, using HIF-1 as a metabolite to regulate PDK1 is seen as another potential therapy, either on its own or in tandem with other therapies, for this type of cancer. In a further developed study, combined PDK1 and CHK1 inhibition was shown to be required to kill glioblastoma stem-like cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\n"}

{"id": "1877581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877581", "title": "Norwegian Buhund", "text": "Norwegian Buhund\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund is a breed of dog of the spitz type. It is closely related to the Icelandic Sheepdog and the Jämthund. The Buhund is used as an all purpose farm and herding dog, as well as watch dog and a nanny dog.\n\nThe name Buhund is derived from the Norwegian word \"bu\", which means homestead, a simple building or mountain hut (where the shepherd lived while looking after his herd in the summer) but can also mean stock, as in livestock, and \"hund\" which means dog. The modern buhund was bred on the rainy western coastlands of Norway from similar dogs used by Vikings.\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund has a square profile, is a little under medium-sized and sports a high set, tightly curled tail carried over the center of the back. The head is wedge shaped with pricked ears and a black nose. Their back is level with a deep chest.\n\nThe Buhund ranges in size from about 43 to 45 centimeter (17 to 18 inches) with the males being 43-46 cm (17-18 in) and females to 44 cm(17 in) high. The weight range is 14-18 kg (31–40 pounds) for males and 12-16 kg (26–35 pounds) for females.\n\nWheaten - Any shade from pale cream to bright orange, with or without dark tipped hairs; as little white as possible; black mask acceptable. Black - Preferably without too much bronzing; with as little white as possible. Areas where white is permissible: a narrow white ring around the neck, a narrow blaze on the face, a small patch of white hairs on the chest, white feet and tip of the tail. Gray dogs with coats similar to the Norwegian Elkhound are sometimes found. In the UK Wolf Sable is also listed in the Kennel Club Breed Standard.\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund is a highly cheerful and active breed. They do not tire easily and require extensive exercise on a daily basis. The Norwegian Buhund needs to expel its energy and becomes destructive and ill-mannered if ignored or made to stay still frequently. In conjunction with their high level of activity and energy, they are also extremely lovable and are known for their love of children. However, due to their high level of energy and need for intensive training, Norwegian Buhunds should always be supervised, especially around children and the elderly. This breed loves to cuddle and give kisses to their masters and families. They form strong bonds with their owners and therefore are natural watch dogs. This can result in aloof behavior and wariness or anxiety around strangers. New owners may find this problematic, since the Norwegian Buhund may bark at each new alarming noise or movement. They are communicative and brave, but rarely will snap or bite without provocation.\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund is highly intelligent. They are extremely headstrong and demonstrate an intense desire to be taught and to learn new things. If appropriate stimulus is not made available, the breed may resort to destructive or inappropriate behavior. The Buhund breed does become bored easily and is known to become restless. Daily exercise is required. This breed is ideal for owners who can dedicate time to exercise and training. With this desire for activity and learning combined with a high level of energy, the Norwegian Buhund makes an excellent agility dog. People who live active lifestyles, or are seeking a dog with which they can become involved in dog sports, will appreciate the personality of the Norwegian Buhund. It is also an ideal dog for people who are athletic and desire a dog to go running, hiking or biking with. This breed makes an excellent companion for a sports enthusiast.\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund is prone to inherited eye issues and hip dysplasia.\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund breed has a short to medium length coat that does not tangle or mat when shedding. Brushing weekly will be fine, but extra brushing is required when the dog is blowing coat twice a year.\n\nThe Norwegian Buhund belongs to a large class of dogs called the Spitz type. There are many variations in size, coat and color among the Spitz breeds. These dogs protected farms and herded cattle and sheep.\n"}

His father was the captain of a whaling brig. He spent a brief period in a dame school but had no other formal education and began work in a shoemaker's shop aged ten. He learned the skills of carpentry, before moving to Sheffield where he met and married Mary Longmore, a farmer's daughter.\n\nApplegarth moved to New York City in December 1854, seeking well paid employment, with only a half crown in his possession. He lived with another immigrant from Sheffield for a time, and held a variety of jobs including master at a railroad station. He admired the democracy of the United States, but was appalled by slavery, and visited Mississippi to witness it for himself, where he met Frederick Douglass. By 1857, Applegarth was confident that he could support his wife in America so sent for her from Sheffield, but she was too ill to travel and so he returned to Sheffield. During the American Civil War, Applegarth strongly supported the unionists.\n\nOnce back in the United Kingdom he joined the Sheffield Carpenters Union, and rose to become their secretary. In 1861 the Sheffield Carpenters Union merged with the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASCJ), and in 1862 was elected as general secretary of the union. The ASCJ was a New Model Union, and Applegarth regularly met with other leading New Model Unionists in London, in what Sidney and Beatrice Webb termed a junta.\n\nApplegarth also became an executive member of the London Trades Council (LTC), and advocated a moderate approach to trade unionism with an emphasis on negotiations rather than strike action, telling his fellow trade unionists to \"Never surrender the right to strike, but be careful how you use a double-edged weapon\". This stance led to conflict with George Potter, the founder of the LTC's journal \"The Bee-Hive\", who argued that the journal should give its support unreservedly to all strike action undertaken by trade unions throughout the country. Applegarth accused him of being a \"manufacturer of strikes\" and of personal dishonesty and maladministration following an investigation into the Bee-Hive in 1865. As a result, Potter was forced to leave the LTC.\n\nUnder Applegarth's leadership, the ASCJ's membership increased from 1000 in 1862 to over 10,000 in 1870, and accumulated funds of over £17,000. During the Royal Commission on Trade Unions (1867), Applegarth vigorously advocated the benefits of New Model Unionism to the committee, answering a total of 633 questions, and was generally regarded as the most impressive pro-trade union witness. Applegarth campaigned for the pro-trade unionist minority report of the commission to be accepted by Gladstone's Liberal government, leading to the Trade Union Act of 1871. In May of the same year he was offered a position on the Royal Commission on Contagious Diseases, which he took despite the protests of the ASCJ, leading him to resign from his position as general secretary. At around this time he joined the Working Men's Committee for Promoting the Separation of Church and State along with Potter and George Howell.\n\nAfter his work for the Royal Commission, Applegarth became a commercial traveller for a French firm selling Henry Fleuss's underwater breathing apparatus. He took out the English patent for the Yablochkov candle and made a fairly successful business out of it based in Epsom. When his old friend Howell lost his seat in Parliament in 1895 and fell ill, Applegarth and the TUC raised a £1650 testimonial to buy him an annuity. In 1898 he became a poultry farmer in Bexley, where he introduced a new breed of French hen.\n\nApplegarth spent his retirement in Brighton, where he was offered the title of Companion of Honour by Lloyd George in 1917. He turned the offer down, saying he preferred to remain \"plain Robert Applegarth\". When he died in 1924 he was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery and given a secular ceremony, according to his instructions.\n\n"}

Konstanz. The group's lyrics are noted for their horror themes and heavily allude to works of classic writers/filmmakers of the genre, such as H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, George A. Romero and John Carpenter, among others. They self-describe their musical style, which mixes gothic metal, doom metal, symphonic metal and horror punk aesthetics, as \"horror metal\".\n\nThe Vision Bleak was formed in 2000, in the Bavarian city of Mellrichstadt, by Markus Stock (a.k.a. Ulf Theodor Schwadorf) and Tobias Schönemann (a.k.a. Allen B. Konstanz). Their first release was the independent extended play \"Songs of Good Taste\", which came out in 2001 and contained, among other tracks, a cover of The Moody Blues' \"Nights in White Satin\". The EP caught the attention of Prophecy Productions, who approached them to record their first full-length, \"The Deathship Has a New Captain\", on 23 February 2004; counting with a guest appearance by Dark Sanctuary vocalist Dame Pandora, it would be their first of many releases under the Prophecy label. A teaser EP containing two tracks which would eventually appear on the album was released the year prior.\n\nIn 2005 the band released \"Carpathia\", a promotional single for their then-upcoming second full-length, \"\", which came out on 29 August 2005.\n\nOn 31 August 2007, the band released their third studio album, \"The Wolves Go Hunt Their Prey\" – it is a loose concept album whose first part is based on the story of the Indian feral girls Amala and Kamala, and its second part is mostly composed of the \"Black Pharaoh Trilogy\", a series of three songs based on H. P. Lovecraft's short story \"The Haunter of the Dark\". A promo EP which served as a teaser for the album, \"Club Single\", was released the month prior.\n\nThe band's fourth album, \"Set Sail to Mystery\", came out on 2 April 2010; it would be their first album (and so far only) to not feature a teaser released before it. It is a concept album loosely based on the writings of Romantic poets such as Edgar Allan Poe, Heinrich Heine and Lord Byron (its opening track, \"A Curse of the Grandest Kind\", takes its lyrics from an excerpt of Byron's 1817 dramatic poem \"Manfred\", while \"Descend into Maelstrom\" references in its lyrics and title Poe's short story \"A Descent into the Maelström\"), and also of H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. Niklas Kvarforth of Shining was a guest musician on the album.\n\nThe band's fifth album, \"Witching Hour\", came out on 27 September 2013. A stop motion music video for the track \"The Wood Hag\", directed and animated by Fursy Teyssier, was uploaded on Prophecy's official YouTube channel as a teaser on 4 September.\n\nOn 31 October 2015, The Vision Bleak announced that they would begin a tour around Europe, accompanied by John Haughm of Agalloch and Danish death-doom band Saturnus, to promote their sixth album, \"The Unknown\", which was released on 3 June 2016. The \"Into the Unknown Tour\" lasted from 25 March to 20 August 2016. A four-track EP that served as a teaser to \"The Unknown\", entitled \"The Kindred of the Sunset\", was announced on 21 February 2016 and eventually released on 25 March.

He earned the degree of \"Diplom-Ingenieur\", and began his career at BMW in 1973 as a Production Planning Engineer. He was promoted to become chairman of the board of BMW from 1993 through 1999. He was also chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, the parent company of the Volkswagen Group, from 2002 to 2006, and chairman of Scania AB until 2007.\n\nDuring his time as head of BMW, Pischetsrieder was known for solidifying the company's position as a leader in the luxury car market with a solid sporting and engineering reputation. His decision in 1994 to purchase Rover Group from British Aerospace was widely regarded as a failure on paper. Although many of the assets were sold at vast profit and the purchase brought the valuable Mini and Land Rover marques into BMW ownership, the Rover passenger car operation drained the company's coffers. Rover was sold off in 2000, with Ford taking on Land Rover, and the Mini brand remaining at BMW. A more lasting achievement was the assumption of the Rolls-Royce marque, a deal which left rival Volkswagen Group manager, Ferdinand Piëch, with only the Bentley marque, and the Crewe factory. However, this operation has turned out to be much more successful than the Rolls Royce operation, and it is a matter of debate whether BMW would have been better off keeping Bentley rather than having to take a licence for the Rolls Royce name\n\nLate in 2000 Pischetsrieder joined Volkswagen Group, mandated initially to take responsibility for quality, as \"the voice of the customer\" across the group, along with specific responsibility for giving the group's SEAT operation a new focus. In fact on 1 July 2000 he was appointed chief executive officer at SEAT and stayed to this position up to 6 March 2002. On 16 April 2002, Pischetsrieder succeeded Piëch as chairman of Volkswagen AG. At Volkswagen, he directed Bugatti Automobiles SAS to reengineer the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, delaying an expected launch. He continued moving the Audi and Volkswagen marques upmarket to some controversy.\n\nHe is known to be an enthusiastic driver, and once wrote off a silver McLaren F1 exotic sports car. There were only 64 street legal versions of the McLaren manufactured.\n\nIn a surprise announcement on 7 November 2006, it was revealed that Pischetsrieder would be stepping down from the top job at Volkswagen AG on 31 December that year. He was to be replaced by Martin Winterkorn, who was head of the Audi division. During Pischetsrieder's time at the helm, the Volkswagen share price rose by 80%, and his dismissal was opposed by (among others) supervisory board member Christian Wulff, who held his position on the board as a result of his position as Minister-President of Lower Saxony: Lower Saxony is a major Volkswagen share holder. Pischetsrieder's dismissal appeared to result from differences with Ferdinand Piëch.\n\nSince 2013 he is chairman of the reinsurance company Munich Re. In April 2014, he was elected as one of the three new members of the supervisory board at Daimler AG, which role he will be performing until 2019.\n\nSir Alec Issigonis, the British car designer and engineer who created the Morris Minor and the Mini, was a first cousin once removed of Pischetsrieder which was regarded as the reason why BMW purchased the Rover Group so Pischetsrieder could get his hands on the Mini brand.\n"}

It is named for Zachary Taylor, the 12th President of the United States, who is buried there with his wife, Margaret Mackall Smith Taylor. Zachary Taylor National Cemetery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 3, 1983. As of 2014, the cemetery has over 14,000 interments and is one of seven national cemeteries in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and one of 112 in the United States. Those buried at the national cemetery served in six wars: Spanish–American War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War.\n\nThe cemetery began as the Taylor family cemetery and holds the graves of the president's parents, Richard Taylor, a colonel in the American Revolutionary War, and Sarah Strother Taylor; W.G.L. Taylor, a captain for the Confederate States of America and other family members. President Taylor's son, Richard Taylor, a general for the Confederate States of America, is buried at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nThe land which became Zachary Taylor National Cemetery was part of Richard Taylor's estate, known as Springfield, given to him in gratitude for his service in the American Revolutionary War. The house in which the family lived for most of their time in Louisville is still nearby, and is called the Zachary Taylor House.\n\nOn November 1, 1850, Zachary Taylor was buried in his family's burial ground. His remains were moved there from the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. where he was interred temporarily from July 13 to October 25, 1850.\n\nIn 1883, the commonwealth of Kentucky placed a fifty-foot monument, topped by a life-sized statue of Zachary Taylor, near his grave. In 1930, a sundial was added.\n\nThe Taylor family in the 1920s initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery. The commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project, turning the half-acre Taylor family cemetery into . However, the Army judge advocate general ruled against acquiring the Taylor cemetery. When the national cemetery was created, the federal government constructed a new mausoleum for Zachary Taylor, made of limestone with a granite base and a marble interior. The mausoleum and adjacent Taylor family graves lie within the boundaries of the national cemetery, but are not owned by the United States government. However, the National Cemetery Administration maintains the Taylor graves as it does the rest of the national cemetery.\n\nThere have been several attempts to increase the size of the cemetery, but each time local residents stopped the growth.\n\nThe National Cemetery made the national news on June 17, 1991, when Zachary Taylor's remains were exhumed to determine if the real cause of death was arsenic poisoning and not an intestinal ailment as previously thought.\n\nThe cemetery is currently closed to new interments. However, space may be available in the same grave site for eligible family members. It is administered by the National Cemetery Administration, a division of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe cemetery is the burial site of two Medal of Honor recipients, Sergeant Willie Sandlin (World War I), United States Army, and Sergeant John C. Squires (World War II), United States Army. Also, United States Air Force Lieutenant General Roscoe Charles Wilson is buried there.\n\nThe Taylor family section is at the rear of the national cemetery. The vault in which Zachary Taylor was first buried still stands near the 1926 mausoleum. Soldiers from Fort Knox engage in a wreath-laying ceremony every November 24, the anniversary of Zachary Taylor's birth.\n\nThe cemetery also contains the war graves of three British Army soldiers who died on the same day (18 March 1944) in the World War II.\n\n\n"}

The garrison at Naas numbered approximately 250 men, supplemented by a number of local yeomen, some of whom had already deserted to the rebels. Importantly, the defenders had some cannon.\n\nThe rebel attack was launched from three directions at around 2:30 a.m and achieved a degree of surprise, driving the garrison back to a barricade outside the gaol, on a slight hill at the centre of the town's main street. Rebel assaults on the barricade were eventually beaten back when the military managed to bring two artillery pieces to bear, firing at close range into the mass of rebels advancing on the then gaol from the north. Hemmed in by buildings, the rebels could not manoeuver, and cavalry were sent in to take advantage of the confusion. The rebels then began to retreat and the bulk of their casualties, about 135, were inflicted at this stage for the loss of about 25 of the military.\n\nOn the same night the Battle of Prosperous about 6 miles north of Naas resulted in a rebel success.\n"}

Self-taught on flute and saxophone, which he began playing at the age of 15, he began to play locally with other Birmingham musicians who would later find international fame in music: Christine Perfect (later Christine McVie), Carl Palmer, Stan Webb, and Mike Kellie. Wood played with Perfect in 1964 in the band Shades of Blue and with Kellie during 1965–1966 in the band Locomotive.\n\nHe attended the Stourbridge College of Art, then the Birmingham School of Art (Painting Dept.) and subsequently was awarded a grant to attend the Royal Academy of Art starting in December 1965.\n\nAged 18, Wood joined the Steve Hadley Quartet, a jazz/blues group in 1962. His younger sister Stephanie designed clothes for the Spencer Davis Group, based in Birmingham, and it was through her that Wood was first introduced to fellow Birmingham native Steve Winwood. A well-known Birmingham club, the Elbow Room, was an after-hours haunt of local bands and musicians and it was here that Wood used to meet up with Winwood and Jim Capaldi. At the age of 18, Winwood abandoned the Spencer Davis Group at the height of their popularity and, along with Wood, Capaldi, and Dave Mason, formed Traffic.\n\nTo focus his fledgling band, Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell arranged for the four to retreat to an isolated farmhouse on the Berkshire Downs near Aston Tirrold. Initially without electricity, telephone or running water, The Cottage (as it became universally known) was so remote that a generator had to be installed to power the group's equipment. A concrete outdoor stage was built with the band's stage equipment set up to overlook the surrounding fields. After six months honing their music, Traffic released their first single, \"Paper Sun\".\n\nIn Traffic, Wood primarily played flute and saxophone, occasionally contributing keyboards, bass and vocals. Wood also co-wrote several of Traffic's songs, particularly during the earlier period of the band's recording career. His most notable contribution is as the co-writer (with Winwood and Capaldi), of \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\".\n\nWood introduced the 17th century traditional song \"John Barleycorn\" to the band after hearing it on The Watersons album \"Frost and Fire\". It became the title song of their 1970 album, \"John Barleycorn Must Die.\"\n\nWood played with Jimi Hendrix in 1968, appearing on \"Electric Ladyland\". When Winwood temporarily formed supergroup Blind Faith in 1969, Wood, Mason and Capaldi joined Mick Weaver otherwise known as Wynder K Frog, to become Mason, Capaldi, Wood and Frog. He then went on to tour the United States with Dr. John, where he met singer Jeanette Jacobs (formerly of the 1960s girl group The Cake). Wood and Jacobs married in November 1972, at Kensington Registry Office, when he was 28 and she was 22.\n\nIn 1969, Wood also appeared on the eponymous second album of Free and the Small Faces' \"The Autumn Stone\". In 1970, Wood and his wife, along with Steve Winwood, joined Ginger Baker's Air Force, releasing one album before reforming Traffic. Wood remained with Traffic from the time of its 1970 reformation until its 1974 breakup. He played on John Martyn's \"Inside Out\" (1973). Throughout Traffic's life, Chris was also in demand as a session musician with his immediately identifiable flute or saxophone playing cropping up on albums by Rebop Kwaku Baah, Tyrone Downie, Fat Mattress, Gordon Jackson, Crawler, The Sky, Bobby Whitlock and others.\n\nThrough much of his life, Wood suffered from addiction to drugs and alcohol, which were initially attributed to a fear of flying. His wife was unfaithful while he was on tour, leading to an increased drinking, culminating in liver disease. He cut down on drinking, but his medication caused further complications. His wife Jeanette, from whom he had separated, died in 1982, at the age of 31, from the effects of a seizure. Wood was profoundly affected by her death.\n\nThe death of two close friends, Free’s Paul Kossoff and former bandmate Rebop Kwaku Baah followed by that of his (by then, estranged) wife laid very heavy on Wood.\n\nIn 1983, Wood died of pneumonia at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England.\n\nAt the time, he was working on a solo album that was to be titled \"Vulcan\", and had recorded material for the album over the previous few years, mostly in London at Island's Hammersmith Studio, The Fall Out Shelter, with engineer Terry Barham, as well as at Pathway Studios in London. Following Wood's death, the Vulcan recordings remained in the possession of Wood's sister, Stephanie. In 2008, with the consent of Stephanie Wood a CD titled \"Vulcan\", consisting of selected material Wood recorded while working on the incomplete album (plus an unreleased Traffic live performance of one of Wood's compositions), was released by Esoteric Recordings.\n\nTraffic recorded one additional studio album, \"Far from Home\" (1994), after Wood's death. The album is dedicated to him, and the central figure on its front cover is a stick figure of a man playing flute.\n\nIn June 2013, on Wood's 69th birthday, the Chris Wood Estate (run by his sister, Stephanie) announced that a commemorative box set was being prepared – in collaboration with contemporary music archivists HiddenMasters, to properly honour Wood's life in music. Among other music, the set would include the album \"Vulcan\" as Chris originally sequenced it in 1978. The box set \"Evening Blue\" was finally released three and a half years later in early 2017, in a special deluxe first edition limited to 1000 copies.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1877637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877637", "title": "The World's Last Night and Other Essays", "text": "The World's Last Night and Other Essays\n\nThe World's Last Night and Other Essays is a collection of essays by C. S. Lewis published in the United States in 1960. The title essay is about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The volume also contains a follow-up to his \"The Screwtape Letters\" in the form of \"Screwtape Proposes a Toast.\" The second, fourth and fifth pieces were published in the U.K. in a volume called \"Screwtape Proposes a Toast and other pieces\" (1965); the first, sixth and seventh were published in the U.K. in \"Fern-seed and Elephants and other essays on Christianity\" (1975). All the pieces were later collected in the comprehensive \"Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces\" (2000).\n\nWhat did Lewis think of the possibility of discovering life on other planets? What implications might such a discovery have for Christian theology? Originally published in the \"Christian Herald\" and entitled “Will We Lose God in Outer Space,” Lewis's essay on the subject was first published in 1958 and later became titled “Religion and Rocketry.” The essay was written in partial response to the writings of Professor Fred B. Hoyle, the Cambridge astronomer and founder of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge.\n\nIn 1958, Hoyle was Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge and engaged in the study of the structure and evolution of the stars. Even though he coined the phrase “Big Bang,” Hoyle rejected the ‘big bang’ theory of the origin of the universe in favor of the steady state theory, which claimed that the universe has always looked as it does now. Martin Ryle, however, held to the big bang theory for the creation of the universe in a moment, the theory that eventually held sway. Some of Hoyle's writings, including science fiction and plays, popularized astronomy. Christopher H. Derrick of Geoffrey Bles publishers, presumably in 1963 and before Lewis's death, wrote a proposal for a book that was to include “Religion and Rocketry,” stating that “This essay seems to have been written in rebuttal of an argument which is only likely to be brought forward by a rather silly minority (though an academically distinguished one)…” Hoyle would have been part of that academically distinguished, but silly, minority.\n\nLewis also mentioned Professor Hoyle (1915–2001) in his essay “The Seeing Eye” (1963). In “The Seeing Eye,” Lewis challenged the conclusion of the Russian cosmonauts, who concluded that there was no God, since they did not find Him in outer space. In that same essay, Lewis claimed that Hoyle and many others were saying that life must have originated in many, many times and places, given the vast size of the universe. He was referring to a series of broadcast talks that Hoyle had given in 1950, later published as The Nature of the Universe, a series of talks that argued against a Christian view of origins and the uniqueness of the Christian faith. Later, in 1977, Hoyle championed the ancient theory of panspermia, supported these days by Richard Dawkins, that life on earth originated with the importation of living cells from space.\n\nThe philosopher C.E.M. Joad agreed with Lewis and concluded that the size of the universe and the span of time in which it formed did not have “any necessary bearing upon our views as to the nature of the universe as a whole, more particularly as regards its origin, purpose, destiny and end.” The enlargement of the scale of the universe did not reduce the importance of mankind. Disagreeing with Hoyle, Lewis thought it unlikely that life existed anywhere else in our solar system, but that it was at least possible elsewhere in the galaxy. He argued that “those who do not find Him on earth are unlikely to find Him in space.” People with dogmatic preconceptions, and scientists are not immune to such positions, will find themselves looking for evidence to support their preconceived opinions. Science is not equipped to do theology and evaluate the arguments for the existence of God, and, furthermore, the discovery of life in other parts of the universe would have no effect upon Christianity.\n\nThe essay itself starts with Lewis proclaiming two equal and opposite scientific proposals: one, that life only began on earth with the rarest of accidents, and another, proposed by Hoyle, that life probably began in many places. Both positions, Lewis wrote, claim to show the absurdity of the Christian belief in divine origins and the Incarnation of Christ. There is nothing odd about arguments from two very different positions both being able to attack Christianity. Since the world is full of many mutually inconsistent theories, the combination of disagreements between them is multidimensional.\n\nThe cogency of Hoyle's argument, wrote Lewis, was dependent upon five other questions, which must be answered before we can give any credence to Hoyle.\n\n\nIn Paul's letter to the Romans (8:19–23), Lewis argued, God hints that the longing for redemption is cosmic, and therefore not limited to this world. Perhaps redemption has happened for all those who need it, has happened through Christ's redemption, and has somehow been extended to other creatures. But we really don't know. And to speculate about other creatures in other worlds takes us into the imaginative narrative that comprises Lewis's Ransom Trilogy, especially \"Out of the Silent Planet\" and \"Perelandra\". One paragraph of the essay in particular, beginning with the words “It is interesting to wonder…,” imagines the scenario that Lewis spells out in \"Out of the Silent Planet\". We find Lewis speculating that the vast distances in the universe are “God’s quarantine precautions,” designed to prevent the rest of the universe from being contaminated by the corruption of our world. The rest of the essay continues that speculation, and I will leave it to the reader of this article to pursue the original article by Lewis and enjoy his speculation for itself.\n\nThe last essay was written by Lewis about the Second Coming, using for its title (and part of the original essay) a phrase from the first line and title of a poem by seventh-century poet John Donne (1572-1631). That poem, \"Holy Sonnet XIII: What If This Present Were The World's Last Night?\" raises the question of how we should live if the world were ending today. Originally entitled \"Christian Hope--Its Meaning for Today,\" this essay was first printed in the periodical \"Religion in Life\" (Winter 1952-53). Its purpose is stated in the first paragraph of the essay: \"I shall endeavor to deal with some of the thoughts that may deter modern men from a firm belief in, or a due attention to, the return or Second Coming of the Saviour.\" Dr. Albert Schweitzer had overemphasized this doctrine, but we should not compensate by underemphasizing it. The essay especially focuses on the nature of Christ, who was the God-Man, and it challenges the modern thought that history always produces progress. He concludes by suggesting that we live our lives, our vocations, with the understanding that there is a judgment coming.\n\n"}

She made her debut that summer against Noriyo Toyoda. She immediately joined Dump Matsumoto's heel stable Gokuaku Domei (\"Atrocious Alliance\"), along with classmate and tag team partner Nobuko Kimura. After the stable dissolved in 1988 due to Matsumoto's retirement, Shishido and Kimura went their separate ways, but re-formed in 1990 as Jungle Jack. Now called Aja Kong and Bison Kimura, they entered a two-year feud against their former allies Bull Nakano and her heel stable Gokumon-to. During their partnership they won the WWWA World Tag Team Championship twice. They lost a hair versus hair match on January 11, 1991, resulting in both women being shaved bald.\n\nKong herself also pursued Nakano for the WWWA World Single Championship during the early 1990s. She failed in several attempts before finally achieving her goal on November 15, 1992, ending Nakano's three-year reign.\n\nIn 1995, Kong made an appearance in the American World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as the sole survivor of a women's elimination match at the pay-per-view Survivor Series by pinning all 4 members of her opposing team, including WWF Women's Champion, Alundra Blayze. Kong also appeared on two episodes of \"Monday Night Raw\" and was victorious in both bouts. During one bout, she broke the nose of Chaparita Asari.\n\nKong was being built up as a challenger for the WWF Women's Championship held by Alundra Blayze. Kong was scheduled to face Blayze at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view in January 1996, but the company elected to end its women's division after Alundra Blayze showed up on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" with the WWF Women's championship and threw the title into a garbage can.\n\nIn 1997, Kong left AJW and started the independent promotion Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion (usually referred to as simply Arsion). She led the organization until February 12, 2001, when she walked out of a tag team match and announced she was quitting.\n\nOn April 30, 2004 at the joshi promotion Gaea Japan's event \"Limit Break\", Kong wrestled Amazing Kong in the latter's Japanese debut. Later in the night, the duo formed a tag team called W Kong. The duo defeated Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka for the AAAW Tag Team Championship on May 5. The team defended the championship all summer, eventually losing to Manami Toyota and Carlos Amano on September 20. They also held tag team championships in Japanese women's promotions AJW and Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling. On June 6, 2006, wrestling as Erika and Margaret, the team defeated Wataru Sakata and Ryoji Sai for the Hustle Super Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles on October 9, 2006 to American tag team Bubba Ray and Devon in a three-way match which also included the team of Sodom and Gamora. On August 26, 2015, Kong reformed the W Kong tag team with Amazing Kong.\n\nKong also wrestled for Mayumi Ozaki's promotion, Oz Academy where she is affiliated with the Jungle Jack 21 stable. She has also held the promotion's championship.\n\nIn December 2011, Kong took part in American promotion Chikara's \"JoshiMania\" weekend, losing to Sara Del Rey in the main event of night one on December 2. The following day, Kong defeated Ayako Hamada in the main event. On the third and final night of the tour, Kong teamed with Mio Shirai and Tsubasa Kuragaki to defeat Hanako Nakamori, Manami Toyota and Sawako Shimono in a six-woman tag team match.\n\nKong returned to the United States on April 11, 2015, working for Shimmer Women Athletes. Kong was brought in as a surprise to take part in Tomoka Nakagawa's retirement event.\n\nOn November 11, 2017, Kong returned to Shimmer Women Athletes joining the Trifecta heel stable with Mercedes Martinez and Nicole Savoy to replace the recently departed (for WWE) Shayna Baszler and appeared in matches the following night as well.\n\nIn May 25, 2019, Kong made her All Elite Wrestling (AEW) debut, as she teamed with Emi Sakura and Yuka Sakazaki where they unsuccessfully challenged the team of Hikaru Shida, Riho, and Ryo Mizunami.\n\nShishido's mother is Japanese and her father, who served in the military, is African American.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1877646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877646", "title": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health", "text": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) is part of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. As the first independent, degree-granting institution for research in epidemiology and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States, the Bloomberg School is a leading international authority on the improvement of health and prevention of disease and disability. The school's mission is to protect populations from illness and injury by pioneering new research, deploying its knowledge and expertise in the field, and training scientists and practitioners in the global defense of human life. The school is ranked first in public health in the \"U.S. News and World Report\" rankings and has held that ranking since 1994.\n\nOriginally named the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the school was founded in 1916 by William H. Welch with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The school was renamed the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on April 20, 2001, in honor of Michael Bloomberg (founder of the eponymous media company) for his financial support and commitment to the school and Johns Hopkins University. Bloomberg has donated a total of $2.9 billion to Johns Hopkins University over a period of several decades.\n\nThe school is also the founder of Delta Omega (est. 1924), the national honorary society for graduate training in public health. The Bloomberg School is fully accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH).\n\nIn 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a conference on the need for public health education in the United States. Foundation officials were convinced that a new profession of public health was needed. It would be allied to medicine but also distinct, with its own identity and educational institutions. The result of deliberations between public health leaders and foundation officials was the Welch–Rose Report of 1915, which laid out the need for adequately trained public health workers, and envisioned an \"institute of hygiene\" for the United States. The Report, reflected the different preferences of the plan's two architects—William Henry Welch favoured scientific research, whereas Wickliffe Rose wanted an emphasis on public health practice.\n\nIn June 1916, the executive committee of the Rockefeller Foundation approved the plan to organize an institute or school of public health at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The institute was named the School of Hygiene and Public Health, indicating a compromise between those who wanted the practical public health training on the British model and those who favoured basic scientific research on the German model. Welch, the first Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine also became the founding Dean of the first school of public health in the United States.\n\nThe facility is located on the former Maryland Hospital site founded in 1797. The Maryland Hospital was originally built as a hospital to care for Yellow Fever for the indigent away from the city. In 1840, the hospital expanded to exclusively care for the mentally ill. In 1873, the buildings were torn down as the facility relocated to a new site as the Spring Grove Hospital Center.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Public Health represents the archetype for formalized public health training and epidemiology education in the United States. By 1922, other schools of public health at Harvard, Columbia and Yale had all been established in accordance with the Hopkins model. The Rockefeller Foundation continued to sponsor the creation of public health schools in the United States and around the world in the 1920s and 1930s, extending the American model of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to countries such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Rumania, Sweden, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.\n\nThe school celebrated its 100th anniversary during the 2015–2016 academic year with programs, festivities, and innovative projects to spotlight 100 years of pioneering public health—connecting a century of achievements to the promise of new advances for the next century.\n\nThe Bloomberg School is the largest school of public health in the world, with 530 full-time and 620 part-time faculty, and 2,030 students from 84 countries. It is home to over fifty \"Research Centers and Institutes\" with research ongoing in the U.S. and more than 90 countries worldwide. The School ranks first in federal research support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), receiving nearly 25 percent of all funds distributed among the 40 U.S. schools of public health, and has consistently been ranked first among schools of public health by \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nThe School offers:\n\nThe Bloomberg School is composed of 10 academic departments:\nIn addition to these ten academic departments, there is a school-wide MPH program (Chair Marie Diener-West) and the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation which is a collaborative program between the School of Public Health and School of Medicine (Chair N. Franklin Adkinson, Jr.).\n\nThe Bloomberg School of Public Health is located in the East Baltimore campus of the Johns Hopkins University. The campus, collectively known as the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI), is also home to the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing and comprises several city blocks, radiating outwards from the Billings Building of the Johns Hopkins Hospital with its historic dome. The main building on which the school is located is on North Wolfe Street; it has nine floors and features an observation area and a fitness center on the top floor. The Bloomberg School also occupies Hampton House on North Broadway. The school is also serviced by the Welch Medical Library, a central resource shared by all the schools of the Medical Campus. The campus includes the Lowell Reed Residence Hall and the Denton Cooley Recreational Center. Public transportation to and from the campus is served by the Baltimore Metro Subway, local buses, and the JHMI shuttle.\n\nSome of the graduates of the Bloomberg School of Public Health include\n\nThe official title of the head of the School has changed periodically between Director and Dean throughout the years. Originally the title was Director. In 1931, it was changed to Dean and in 1946 back to Director. In 1958, the title again became Dean. The Deans (Directors) of the Bloomberg School include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1877647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877647", "title": "Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation", "text": "Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation\n\nOntario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (), known for corporate branding purposes simply as OLG since 2006, is a Crown corporation owned by the Government of Ontario, Canada. It is responsible for the province's lotteries, charity and Aboriginal casinos, commercial casinos, and slot machines at horse-racing tracks. It was created in April 2000 when the Ontario Lottery Corporation (OLC) was merged with the Ontario Casino Corporation (OCC), established in 1994; prior to 2006, the combined entity was known in short form as the OLGC (or SLJO in French). OLG employs over 8000 individuals throughout Ontario.\n\nOLG's prize centre is located in Toronto, while the corporation's primary headquarters is located in Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nWhereas OLG is responsible for, and operates a variety of gaming services, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) regulates casino gaming. OLG reports through its board of directors to the Minister of Finance. From 2003 to 2007 it was under the Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal.\n\nThe OLG operates a self-exclusion program for people with gambling addictions, although this program has been controversial. The Ontario problem gambling hotline is 1.888.230.3505\n\nThe Ontario Lottery Corporation was created in February 1975 under the Ontario Lottery Corporation Act, 1975 (repealed in 1999 and replaced with the current Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation Act). Wintario was the first lottery game offered by the fledgling OLC on April 3, 1975 and the first drawing took place on May 15, 1975. The product was discontinued in late 1996 after awarding over CAD$1.1 billion in winnings.\n\nOLG has chosen to modernize as over the past 30 years, demographics have changed, as have people’s shopping patterns. Global gaming options are more accessible — particularly online. At the same time, U.S. visitors have declined. All of these shifts have put the industry and its contribution to the province at risk in the long term. Modernization will enable OLG to provide additional revenues to the Province to help fund the operation of hospitals and other provincial priorities.\n\nAs a result of modernization, OLG will:\nModernization will help to create jobs across Ontario and trigger private sector investment. The capital costs of expanding, improving or simply maintaining gaming facilities will no longer be carried by taxpayers. Ontario residents and visitors will have access to more innovative and fun games. In addition, the existing lottery distribution network will be expanded to include multi-lane sales at large retailers, accommodating a broader customer base.\n\nAs part of modernization efforts OLG has introduced iGaming. iGaming is the first provincially government-regulated internet gambling site. OLG has launched PlayOLG.ca as well as a mobile app PlayOLG. These are new secure online gambling programs that features fun and exciting games, along with a comprehensive Responsible Gambling program. PlayOLG.ca does offer increased player protections, secure transactions and data privacy, and will require players to register to play.\n\nPlayOLG.ca offers Ontario citizens over the age of 18 a full range of online lottery tickets for national games such as LOTTO MAX, LOTTO 6/49 and ENCORE.\n\nPlayOLG.ca offers Ontario residents over the age of 19 a full range of online gaming options, including:\nFuture state product releases will include:\n\nOLG has established this website in an attempt to protect consumers from offshore internet gaming sites. Offshore gaming sites do not verify the age of the participant, and have no player protection or secure transactions. OLG takes a strong stand against underage gambling and the PlayOLG.ca registration process will include age verification that will help prevent minors from registering an account.\n\nOLG has five business divisions:\n\nOLG operates nine draw-style lottery games through retailers across the province.\n\n\n\n\nLotto 6/49 and Lotto Max are operated across Canada by the Interprovincial Lottery Corporation. The corporation also offers instant scratch games under the brand Instant Games, and sports games under the brands Pro-Line, Point-Spread and Pro-Picks.\n\nOLG used to offer a subscription-based lottery service called LOTTO ADVANCE for Lotto 6/49. This service is now discontinued since September 7, 2013.\n\nOLG owns and manages ten casinos, some of which have private operators:\n\nOLG operates slot machine facilities at 14 racetracks across Ontario. They are located at:\n\n\nSlots at racetracks generated $300 million annually for the racetracks until 2012 when the program ended. However, threatened with the closure of numerous tracks, the Ontario government extended the plan while it determined its future direction in gaming facilities.\n\nOLG operates e-bingo (electric bingo) centres in Barrie, Peterborough, Kingston and Sudbury. Some games are linked to be played at all four simultaneously.\n\nThe minimum age to purchase OLG lottery tickets is 18; however, for patronizing casinos and/or parimutuel facilities in the province, it is 19.\n\nViolators who sell OLG lottery tickets to anyone under the age of 18 can face significant fines under the legislation passed in 1997. In addition OLG reserves the right to suspend violators found to have sold OLG lottery tickets to anyone under the age of 18.\n\nPrizes under $1000 can be collected directly from a retailer that has a lottery terminal in store. This is subject to cash availability. People can collect bigger prizes by visiting an OLG Casino or Slot facility. This can be done by mailing the ticket to the OLG Prize Centre or by visiting the OLG Prize Centre in Toronto. When claiming the prize at the OLG Prize Centre, the prizewinner must have valid government identification as well as providing a signature. The ticket will be double checked in case of fraud.\n\nIf the prize money is $5000 or more the terminal will freeze and OLG will be contacted. OLG will inform the winner directly of how to claim their prize.\n\nIf the prize money is $10,000 or more, the process of claiming your prize will involve an interview and an investigator validating the authority of the ticket. Once approved, there will be a picture taken of you with your cheque.\n\nOLG publicizes all winners of $1,000 or more on their website.\n\nThere is a time period of exactly one year from the draw date to claim Ontario lottery games.\n\nOn October 25, 2006, the CBC program \"The Fifth Estate\" aired an investigative report on lottery retailers winning major prizes, focusing on the ordeal of 82-year-old Bob Edmonds. His $250,000 winning Encore ticket was stolen by a convenience store clerk when he went to have his ticket checked in 2001. For the next four years, OLG ignored Edmonds' inquiries after the clerk and her husband were falsely named the rightful winners. Later, when the couple were arrested for fraud, OLG refused to return his winnings, maintaining that it wasn't their responsibility that they had been tricked; in 2004, a judge disagreed, and forced OLG to give Edmonds his money. They did so, on the condition that Edmonds sign a confidentiality agreement, so that he would never tell the press about certain details of the ordeal. Also, \"The Fifth Estate\" uncovered internal OLG memos where several employees admitted they believed Edmonds' story. Immediately following the broadcast, Edmonds received a call from OLG's president, Duncan Brown, who apologized and claimed he was ashamed about how his staff treated Edmonds. OLG later released Edmonds from the confidentiality agreement. He died on April 2, 2007.\n\nIn another case, Toronto variety store owner Hafiz Malik had defrauded four school board employees out of their $5.7 million prize. He was arrested after the original ticket owners filed a complaint with police. The OPP seized or froze over $5-million of Malik's assets, including bank accounts, three cars, and a home in Mississauga. OLG has since awarded the rightful winners the prize plus interest.\n\nThe report by \"the fifth estate\" added that over 200 lottery retailers in Ontario have won major prizes from 1999 to 2006. A statistician featured in the report, Jeff Rosenthal, calculated that the chance that this would occur purely out of luck is one in a \"trillion trillion trillion trillion\" (or quindecillion). OLG did have a policy on insider wins, but it was rarely enforced during that period. Provincial ombudsman André Marin released a report stating that Ontario store owners and their families claimed about $100 million in lottery wins between 1999 and 2006, with tens of millions of fraudulent claims being ignored by the OLGC.\n\nOLG has since mandated new security measures to protect lottery customers, notably with customer-facing displays when tickets are checked, as well as special music played with a winning ticket. As of January 28, 2008, lottery retailers are required to ensure that tickets are signed. There is a signature box shown on the front of all on-line lottery tickets.\n\nIn March 2007, OLG announced that it had recalled over 1,000,000 scratch and win tickets. The \"Super Bingo\" series of tickets were removed from retail stores after it was announced that a customer made the claim that he could visually tell which tickets were winners. It was the largest recall ever of a lottery ticket in Canada, and were prompted in part from greater media scrutiny regarding ongoing fraud investigations.\n\nIn January 2009, OLG announced it has recalled over 1,000 scratch and win tickets. The \"Fruit Scratch\" series of lottery tickets were removed from retail stores after it was discovered that over dozens of lottery tickets were reportedly misprinted. Up to 150 of the misprinted tickets were reportedly purchased at eight stores across Southern Ontario one-week before the recall was issued. OLG has since reached an undisclosed settlement with a 27-year-old Thomas Noftall from Brampton, Ontario, who was mistakenly told that he may have won $135,000 on a misprinted lottery ticket.\n\nIn February 2007, it was discovered that 87 slot machines at Provincially run casinos were displaying subliminal messages on slot machine screens to players. An image of a winning symbol combination was shown quickly before or during the simulated spinning of the slot machine reels. The manufacturer, Konami, provided a software update for the machines.\n\nIn the wake of these controversies, the provincial government ordered Duncan Brown to be relieved of his position as OLG chief on 21 March 2007. This was not public knowledge until two days later, when Brown's dismissal took effect. David Caplan, Ontario's minister responsible for OLG, intended to announce this firing on 26 March following the release of a report on OLG's situation by provincial ombudsman André Marin. Marin criticized the OLG for being more fixated on profits than the integrity of games after a disproportionate number of lottery retailers or their families claimed winning tickets.\n\nCasino clients who recognize that they have a gambling addiction can benefit from the self-exclusion program operated by the OLG. An investigation conducted by the CBC's The Fifth Estate (TV series) in late 2017 led to concerns as to whether the program is effective. According to a CBC article, \"Gambling addicts ... said that while on the ... self-exclusion list, they entered OLG properties on a regular basis\" in spite of the facial recognition technology in place at the casinos. As well, a CBC journalist who tested the system found that he was able to enter casinos and gamble on four distinct occasions, in spite of being registered and photographed for the program. Previous studies in other countries have also confirmed that self-exclusion programs can be difficult to enforce.\n\nSome experts maintain that casinos in general arrange for self-exclusion programs as a public relations measure without actually helping those with problem gambling issues. A campaign of this type \"deflects attention away from problematic products and industries,\" according to Natasha Dow Schull, a cultural anthropologist at New York University and author of the book \"Addiction by Design.\" Other experts believe that self-enforcement is part of the problem gambler's own responsibility, as one aspect of any therapy program. \"Without such acceptance of responsibility, much of the effectiveness of self-exclusion programs would be lost\", as one explained.\n\nAs OLG literature confirms, the enforcement by a casino cannot be expected to be 100% foolproof. \"If you attempt to re-enter a gaming facility in Ontario,\nyour image may be captured by cameras and you may be automatically detected by security.\" An OLG spokesman provided this response when questioned by the CBC after the investigation of the self-enforcement program had been completed: \"We provide supports to self-excluders by training our staff, by providing disincentives, by providing facial recognition, by providing our security officers to look for players. No one element is going to be foolproof because it is not designed to be foolproof\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1877672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877672", "title": "Firle", "text": "Firle\n\nFirle (; Sussex dialect: \"Furrel\" ) is a village and civil parish in the Lewes District of East Sussex, England. Firle refers to an old-English/Anglo-Saxon word \"fierol\" meaning overgrown with oak. Although the original division of East Firle and West Firle still remains, East Firle is now simply confined to the houses of Heighton Street, which lie to the east of the Firle Park. West Firle is now generally referred to as Firle although West Firle remains its official name. It is located south of the A27 road four miles (9 km) east of Lewes.\n\nDuring the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–66) Firle was part of the Abbey of Wilton's estate. Following the Norman conquest of England the village and surrounding lands were passed to Robert, Count of Mortain. Half-brother of King William I, Robert was the largest landowner in the country after the monarch. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, referred to as 'Ferla'. The value of the village is listed as being £44, which was amongst the highest in the county.\n\nThe manor house, the site on which Firle Place now stands, was occupied from the early 14th century by the 'de Livet' (Levett) family, an ancient Sussex gentry family of Norman descent who owned the manor. The Levett family would later include founders of Sussex's iron industry, royal courtiers, knights, rectors, an Oxford University dean, a prominent early physician and medical educator, and even a lord mayor of London. An ancient bronze seal found in the 1800s near Eastbourne, now in the collection of the Lewes Castle Museum, shows the coat-of-arms of John Livet and is believed to have belonged to the first member of the family named lord of Firle in 1316. On the bankruptcy of lord of the manor Thomas Levett in 1440, the ownership passed to Bartholomew Bolney, whose daughter married William Gage in 1472. Following the death of Bolney in 1476 without a male heir, the seat of Firle Place was passed to William Gage and has remained the seat of the Viscount Gage ever since.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Firle Plantation to the south of the village was the operational base of a four-man Home Guard Auxiliary Unit.\n\nThe commonly used word greengage almost certainly derives from a member of the Gage family, though there is some confusion over whether it was the Reverend John Gage or Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet who are both variously credited for the import of this fruit into Britain from France.\n\nThe writer Virginia Woolf visited nearby Lewes in December 1910 and decided to relocate in Firle, where she rented a house and renamed it \"Little Talland House\". Pointz Hall, a fictional manor from her novel \"Between the Acts\", is believed to be inspired by Firle Place. Woolf's sister, the painter and interior designer Vanessa Bell, moved to Firle in 1916 taking residence with her live-in lover Duncan Grant in Charleston Farmhouse, which subsequently became a regular haunt of the Bloomsbury Group. Vanessa Bell, her son Quentin Bell, and Duncan Grant are all buried in the churchyard of St Peter's, Firle.\n\nWriter Katherine Mansfield, who had close ties with the Bloomsbury Group, also lived in Firle for a brief time. Her landlord was economist John Maynard Keynes, who moved to Firle in 1925 and died there in 1946. Keynes was cremated and his ashes scattered above the downs of nearby Tilton.\n\nGeneral Thomas Gage was born in Firle.\n\nSt Peter's Church notably contains an alabaster effigy of Sir John Gage wearing his Order of the Garter and lying beside his wife Philippa. It also has a John Piper stained-glass window in warm colours, depicting Blake's Tree of Life. There are also memorials for those named Bolney, Moreton, Levett, Swaffield and others. The current vicar is the Reverend Peter Owen-Jones.\n\nThe \"Ram Inn\" is the only remaining one of the village's three original public houses, that previously all acted as resting stops on the Lewes to Alfriston coach road. It was also the village court room where the rents for tenants farmers were collected and set. The area in front of the Ram is called the Beach, not to be confused with the Dock which is further up the street.\n\nFirle Cricket Club was founded in 1758 and is said to be one of the oldest in the country. Even earlier in 1725 Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet challenged the Duke of Richmond to a game of cricket, one of the first recorded matches. The club continues to be central to village life and has two teams which both compete in the East Sussex Cricket League. The Firle 1st XI are in ESCL Division 3 and the Firle 2nd XI are in ESCL Division 9. Previously both teams played in the Cuckmere Valley League; 2007 was their first year in the ESCL.\n\nSouth of the village lie the South Downs and Firle Beacon, which reaches a height of 712 feet (217 m). The beacon was once a lighting beacon used as part of a warning system during the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. On the site there are also around 50 Bronze Age burial barrows.\nFirle Bonfire Society is first mentioned in 1879 in a diary of the then vicar of Firle, Reverend Crawley, though it was re-formed in 1982 to encourage and promote traditional bonfire festivities in the village. The society forms part of a network of bonfire societies in the Lewes area which serve the purpose both of remembering the Gunpowder Plot and of recalling the fate of the Sussex Martyrs. The village holds its celebrations in October before the main event in Lewes. Traditionally the Firle Bonfire Society Pioneers wear Valencian costumes. It is customary to burn an effigy other than Guy Fawkes; in 2003 an effigy of a Gypsy family in a caravan was burned, sparking a controversy that resulted in members of the bonfire society being arrested.\n\nOn a local level, Firle is governed by Firle Parish Council, which meets every two months in the Firle village memorial hall. Its responsibilities include footpaths, street lighting, playgrounds and minor planning applications. The parish council has five seats available which were uncontested in the May 2007 election.\n\nThe next level of government is the district council. The parish of Firle lies within the Ouse Valley and Ringmer ward of Lewes District Council which returns three seats to the council. The election on 4 May 2007 elected two Liberal Democrats and one Conservative.\n\nEast Sussex County Council is the next tier of government, for which Firle is within the Ouse Valley East division. The council has responsibility for education, libraries, social services, civil registration, trading standards and transport. Elections for the county council are held every four years.

{"id": "1877683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877683", "title": "Proto-Balto-Slavic language", "text": "Proto-Balto-Slavic language\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic (PBS) is a reconstructed proto-language descending from Proto-Indo-European (PIE). From Proto-Balto-Slavic, the later Balto-Slavic languages are thought to have developed, composed of sub-branches Baltic and Slavic, and including modern Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian and Serbo-Croatian among others.\n\nLike most other proto-languages, it is not attested by any surviving texts but has been reconstructed using the comparative method. There are several isoglosses that Baltic and Slavic languages share in phonology, morphology and accentology, which represent common innovations from Proto-Indo-European times and can be chronologically arranged.\n\nProto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration in Proto-Balto-Slavic. Stops were no longer distinguished between fortis and aspirated but were voiceless and voiced. However, several new palatal (postalveolar) consonants had developed: *ś and *ź from earlier palatovelar plosives and *š from *s as a result of the Ruki sound law.\n\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic preserved much of the late Proto-Indo-European vowel system. Short \"*o\" was merged into \"*a\", and former \"*eu\" had become \"*jau\".\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic also possessed \"sonorant diphthongs\", consisting of a short vowel followed by \"*l\", \"*m\", \"*n\" or \"*r\". These were inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and formed anew from PIE syllabic sonorants. Although not diphthongs in the traditional sense, they behaved as a single syllable nucleus in Proto-Balto-Slavic, and could bear the acute like long vowels and regular diphthongs.\n\nMost Proto-Balto-Slavic words could be accented on any syllable, as in Proto-Indo-European. The placement of the accent was changed significantly relative to PIE, with much paradigmatic leveling of the mobile PIE accent, along with leftward and rightward shifts conditioned by the surrounding phonemes. There is still some disagreement among linguists on the exact position of the accent in each Proto-Balto-Slavic form, and the rules governing these changes.\n\nSome syllables in Proto-Balto-Slavic had an additional distinguishing feature, known as \"acute\". It is primarily a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European laryngeals, as well as a result of Winter's law. The exact nature of the acute is not clear, and different linguists have different interpretations.\n\nThe modern interpretation, favoured by an increasing number of linguists, is that the acute was realised as glottalisation, an interruption of voicing similar to the stød found in Danish. This glottalisation is still found in modern Samogitian and Latvian, under the term \"broken tone\". Olander indicates it with a superscript glottalisation symbol \"ˀ\" after the nucleus of the syllable, while Jasanoff is more noncommittal and uses underlining. Some linguists go further, and interpret the acute as an actual consonantal segment, which Derksen indicates as a glottal stop \"ʔ\" and Kortlandt as a laryngeal consonant \"H\". They reconstruct this consonantal segment not just after vowels, but also before them, as direct reflexes of PIE laryngeals. Such consonantal reflexes of laryngeals are not widely accepted, however. For consistency, Olander's glottalisation symbol \"ˀ\" will be used in this article.\n\nIn Proto-Balto-Slavic, the acute was independent of accent position, and could appear on any \"long\" syllable, which included:\n\nThus, any syllable was either long with acute, long without acute or short. Syllables without acute are sometimes collectively termed \"circumflex\", although this term is also used specifically for \"long\" syllables lacking the acute. Within an inflectional paradigm, a long syllable could become short if the nucleus was immediately followed by an inflectional ending beginning with a vowel. This, in turn, resulted in the loss of the acute, as the acute was not permitted on short syllables. Such alternations were found in consonant stem nouns and in primary verbs.\n\nNo modern language retains the original Balto-Slavic distribution of the acute. In Lithuanian and Slavic, the acute distinction was lost on unaccented syllables and converted to an intonation distinction. This happened relatively late and not before some important accentual changes occurred, such as Fortunatov–de Saussure's law and Dybo's law. In Latvian, the acute is reflected as the glottalised \"broken tone\" in words that originally had mobile accentuation.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained the system of ablaut from its parent language, but it was far less productive and had been significantly reworked. Vowel alternations were often leveled, but it is not always easy to determine how far this leveling had progressed by the time the Balto-Slavic dialects began to diverge, as the leveling progressed along the same lines in all of them to some degree.\n\nThe lengthened grade remained productive in word derivation and was used in many innovative formations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European. After the merger of \"*o\" and \"*a\", the resulting phoneme \"*a\" could lengthen to both \"*ā\" and \"*ō\".\n\nPre-Proto-Slavic retained many such uses of lengthened grades in morphology. The length distinctions are reflected as vowel quality distinctions in Late Common Slavic (LCS) and the later Slavic languages:\n\nThese are similar examples in Lithuanian:\n\nOn the basis of the existing length alternations inherited from Proto-Indo-European, new alternations arose between the long \"*ī\", \"*ū\" and the short \"*i\", \"*u\". This latter type of apophony was not productive in PIE. Compare:\n\nThe new type of apophonic length was especially used in Pre-Proto-Slavic in the formation of durative, iterative and imperfective verbs. Compare:\n\nCertain pairs of words show a change of older initial \"*a-\" (from PIE , , , ) to \"*e-\", which is sometimes called \"Rozwadowski's rule\". The exact conditioning of this change is currently not well understood, but led to alternations between \"*e-\" and \"*a-\" in related words or even as alternative forms of the same word. The alternations often gave rise to different initial vowels in different languages. Several words retained the alternation into Proto-Slavic times as well, which became an alternation between \"*(j)e-\" and \"*o-\":\n\nAustrian Balto-Slavist Georg Holzer has reconstructed a relative chronology of 50 Balto-Slavic sound changes, referring only to phonology, not to accentuation, from Proto-Balto-Slavic down to the modern daughter languages. However, only the first 12 are Common Balto-Slavic and so relevant for this article (only Winter's law is a unique common change):\n\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic generally shows Satem reflexes of the three velar series: labiovelars merge into the plain velars while palatovelars develop into sibilants (\"*ś\" and \"*ź\").\n\nThere are a number of words in Balto-Slavic that show Centum reflexes instead, with palatovelars appearing as plain velars. A number can be explained by regular sound laws, but some laws have been obscured by numerous analogical developments. Others are argued to be borrowings from Centum languages.\n\nFor example, Proto-Balto-Slavic \"*kárˀwāˀ\" 'cow' (Lithuanian \"kárvė\", OCS \"krava\", Russian \"koróva\") is likely a feminine derivation of a lost masculine noun that was likely borrowed from Proto-Celtic \"*karwos\" \"deer\" (Middle Welsh \"carw\", Middle Breton \"karo\", Middle Cornish \"carow\"), which in turn is a regular reflex of PIE .\n\nPIE palatovelars could also depalatalize in Balto-Slavic. Several depalatalization rules for Balto-Slavic have been proposed. According to Matasović, the depalatalization of palatovelars occurred before sonorant followed by a back vowel: Ḱ > K/_RV. That would explain Centum reflexes such as these ones:\n\nAnother view is that satemization occurred in Baltic and Slavic independently after Slavic had split off.\n\nPIE \"*s\" was preserved in Balto-Slavic in most positions. According to the Ruki law, it became \"*š\" when it was preceded by \"*r\", \"*u\", \"*k\" or \"*i\". It also included diphthongs ending in \"*u\" or \"*i\", the long vowels \"*ū\" and \"*ī\" (whether original or from a following laryngeal), and the voiced velar \"*g\".\n\nAmong the Balto-Slavic languages, the evidence of Ruki law is recognizable only in Lithuanian and Slavic because in the other languages \"*š\", \"*ś\" and \"*s\" all merge into plain \"*s\". In Lithuanian, \"*š\" and \"*ś\" are merged to \"*š\" instead, remaining distinct from \"*s\". In Slavic, \"*ś\" merges with \"s\" but \"*š\" remains distinct (and becomes \"*x\" before back vowels).\n\nMost handbooks, on the basis of Lithuanian material, state that in Baltic Ruki law has been applied only partially. The most common claim is that the law applied unconditionally in Lithuanian only after \"*r\", while after \"*u\", \"*k\" and \"*i\", both \"*s\" and \"*š\" occur. Compare:\n\nThere is no simple solution to such double reflexes the Ruki law in Lithuanian and thus no simple answer to the question of whether Ruki law is a common Balto-Slavic isogloss or not. The most probable answer seems to be the assumption that PIE \"*s\" was changed to \"*š\" after \"*r\", \"*u\", \"*k\", \"*i\" completely regularly within Balto-Slavic proper, but the traces of the effect of RUKI law were erased by subsequent changes in Lithuanian such as the change of word-final \"*-š\" to \"*-s\".\n\nGenerally, it can be ascertained that Lithuanian shows the effect of Ruki law only in old words inherited from Balto-Slavic period so Lithuanian \"š\" appears in words that have a complete formational and morphological correspondence in Slavic (ruling out the possibility of accidental, parallel formations).\n\nIt appears that palatovelars yielded fricatives in Proto-Balto-Slavic before the effect of RUKI law, so that appears simply as \"*ś\". Compare:\n\nBoth Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Balto-Slavic had systems of accentual mobility, in which the accent would be placed on different syllables in different inflections of the same word. The systems of the two languages are vastly different in detail, however. PIE mobility and Balto-Slavic mobility are unconnected; Balto-Slavic mobility is not inherited from Proto-Indo-European, but formed entirely anew. PIE mobility was entirely lost in the early stages of Proto-Balto-Slavic, by eliminating the accentual distinction between \"strong\" and \"weak\" forms (accented further to the left and right, respectively), usually in favour of the weak forms, i.e. accent on the suffix syllable for proterokinetic stems. Hysterokinetic stems already effectively had fixed accent on the first syllable after the root, and retained this. Amphikinetic stems joined this pattern.\n\nThe exact process by which the new Balto-Slavic type of mobility arose is still a hotly debated topic, although some details are clear. As a general rule, nouns that had the accent on the ending (\"oxytones\") became mobile, while those that had accent on the root (\"barytones\") retained their fixed accent. Words with mobile accent had accent on the leftmost syllable of the stem in some forms, accent on the rightmost syllable of the ending in others (modified by Hirt's law).\n\nThe following sections lay out the explanations for mobility given by various linguists. The explanations are very different in nature, and sometimes also give different results for different cases. The \"incorrect\" outcomes are in turn explained by each in their own way.\n\nJ. Jasanoff proposes two rules explaining the rise of mobility.\nAfter these changes, analogical changes took place. The mobility pattern of prefixed verbs was extended to unprefixed verbs. The final accent of nouns with two syllables before the ending (resulting from Proto-VDL) was extended to nouns with one syllable before the ending, e.g. regular *\"su᷅Hnumos\" → analogical \"*suHnumo̍s\" > Proto-Balto-Slavic \"*sūˀnumás\" based on regular \"*golHwinomo̍s\".\n\nKortlandt proposes three changes that created new mobility:\n\nOlander's “mobility law” presupposes some conditions, namely:\nThe mobility law itself then states that the accent was deleted if it fell on the last mora of a word, and the word became inherently unaccented. Such words appeared with a default accent on the leftmost mora of the word.\n\nThe Moscow accentological school considers the Proto-Balto-Slavic mobile accent paradigm to be a direct reflex of recessive Proto-Indo-European platforms. Whereas in the Indo-Iranian and Hellenic in a recessive platforms, there was a shift of accent to the right, thus moving from the paradigmatic of the accent system to the categorical of the accent system:\n\nHirt's law caused the accent to retract to the previous syllable if the vowel in the preceding syllable was immediately followed by a laryngeal. It took place before the addition of epenthetic vowels before syllabic sonorants, so at the time of the change, syllabic sonorants still acted as a vocalic nucleus like the true vowels and could attract the accent as well.\n\nHirt's law took place after the creation of new accentual mobility, and served to modify it. Where endings of mobile-accented words had multiple syllables, it could shift the accent from the final syllable onto the preceding one, thus creating the non-final accent of Slavic \"*-ìti\" (infinitive) and \"*-àxъ\" (locative plural). If the accent was shifted from the ending of a mobile-accent word onto the stem, the word was usually converted to a fixed-accent pattern:\nHowever, in some cases, Hirt's law does not appear to have taken place where it would be expected, and the words remain mobile-accented:\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European syllabic sonorants \"*l̥\", \"*r̥\", \"*m̥\" and \"*n̥\" (abbreviated \"*R̥\") developed a prothetic vowel in front of them, converting them into \"sonorant diphthongs\". This change occurred after Hirt's law, which operated on original syllabic sonorants but not on sonorant diphthongs.\n\nBoth \"*i\" and \"*u\" appear as prothetic vowels, yielding reflexes \"*im\", \"*in\", \"*ir\", \"*il\" (\"*iR\") and \"*um\", \"*un\", \"*ur\", \"*ul\" (\"*uR\"). It has remained an unsolved problem to this day as to the exact phonological conditions that trigger which reflex. Regardless, analysis of their distribution has shown that \"*i\" appears much more often, suggesting that it is the default reflex, with \"*u\" appearing only in special cases. In a sample of 215 Balto-Slavic lexical items, 36 (17%) are attested only with \"*uR\" reflexes, 22 (10%) with both reflexes in the same language or branch or with one in Slavic and the other in Baltic, and the remaining 157 (73%) are attested only with \"*iR\" reflex.\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed, the most notable being the one by André Vaillant from 1950. According to him, \"*u\" arose after PIE labiovelars. If true, it would be the only trace of PIE labiovelars in Balto-Slavic.\n\nAfter surveying Reinhold Trautmann's 1924 Balto-Slavic dictionary, Jerzy Kuryłowicz in 1956 found no phonologically consistent distribution for the dual reflexes except in a single position: after PIE palatovelars Baltic and Slavic have only \"*iR\" reflex.\n\nGeorge Shevelov in 1965 inspected Slavic data in much detail, but in the end, he demonstrated only that the\ndistribution of the dual reflexes in Slavic is not reducible to phonological conditioning.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Christian Stang in 1966 Kuryłowicz's statistics proved only that \"*iR\" reflexes are much more frequent than \"*uR\" reflexes. Stang made several important observations:\n\nStang's analysis indicates that \"*iR\" was the regular result of the diphthongization of PIE syllabic sonorants. Doublets with expressive meaning are then explained as expressively motivated \"*uR\" replacements of the original \"*iR\" reflex, or as borrowings from substratum dialects (such as Germanic) that regularly had the \"*R̥\" > \"*uR\" reflex, when (pre-)Balto-Slavic no longer had syllabic sonorants and were then used side by side with the original reflex.\n\nAccording to Jānis Endzelīns and Reinhold Trautmann \"*uR\" reflex resulted in zero-grade of morphemes that had PIE \"*o\" (> Balto-Slavic \"*a\") in normal grade.\n\nMatasović, in 2008, proposed the following rules:\n\nAccording to the traditional school, laryngeals disappeared as independent phonemes. Some linguists of the Leiden school, in particular Derksen and Kortlandt, reconstruct a glottal or laryngeal consonant for Proto-Balto-Slavic, as a direct reflex of original laryngeals. The remainder of this section thus only applies if one does not follow that idea.\n\nLike in almost all Indo-European branches, laryngeals in the syllable onset were lost, as were all word-initial laryngeals. Laryngeals between consonants disappeared as well, but in the first syllable, they are reflected as \"*a\". Compare:\n\nOther laryngeals were lost in Proto-Balto-Slavic, but in some cases, the syllable was acuted as a \"leftover\" of the former laryngeal. The following outcomes can be noted, with H standing for a laryngeal, V for a vowel, R for a sonorant and C for any consonant:\n\nIn the case of a \"VHV\" sequence, the outcome is \"VRV\" with a semivowel when the first vowel is close \"*i\" or \"*u\", reflected in PIE \"blood\" (gen. sg.) > PBS > Slavic . In other cases, the outcome is a long non-acute vowel.\n\nThe outcome of long vowels inherited directly from Proto-Indo-European, not lengthened by a laryngeal, is disputed. Traditional opinion holds that the acute is an automatic reflex of vowel length, and therefore all long vowels were automatically acuted, whether original or resulting from a following laryngeal. Absolutely word-final long vowels of PIE origin were not acuted, but remained distinct from long vowels resulting from laryngeals, a distinction also found in Proto-Germanic \"overlong\" vowels. Kortlandt instead takes the position that the acute reflects laryngeals only; thus inherited long vowels do not trigger the acute. Regardless, the acute appears in all cases of vowel lengthening within Balto-Slavic. All long vowels that arose as part of word formations or sound changes within the Balto-Slavic period received the acute. This included the new alternations \"*u\" ~ \"*ū\" and \"*i\" ~ \"*ī\" that were innovated within Balto-Slavic.\n\nAside from acuteness, syllabic sonorants followed by laryngeals show the same outcome as syllabic sonorants in other environments. Balto-Slavic shares that characteristic with Germanic but no other Indo-European languages, which show clearly distinct reflexes in this case. Compare:\n\nWinter's law caused lengthening of vowels if a plain voiced stop followed, and the new long vowels received the acute. According to some analyses, the change occurred only if the stop was in syllable coda (the syllable ending with that consonant).\n\nThe plain and aspirated stops merged in Balto-Slavic, but Winter's law operated before this merger had taken place. Consequently, the distinction between those two series has been indirectly preserved in Proto-Balto-Slavic by long acuted vowels. Furthermore, Winter's law took place before \"*o\" and \"*a\" merged, as it lengthened earlier \"*o\" to \"*ōˀ\" and \"*a\" to \"āˀ\".\n\nOn the basis of relative chronology of sound changes, it has been ascertained that Winter's law acted rather late, after some other less prominent Balto-Slavic changes had occurred such as after the disappearance of laryngeals in prevocalic position. Compare:\n\nThe rules governing the emergence of the acute from voiced stops seem complicated when they are formulated within the framework of \"classical\" Proto-Indo-European laryngeal theory, as there is no obvious connection between laryngeals and voiced stops, both of which trigger the acute. Frederik Kortlandt has proposed an alternative, more elegant and economic rule for the derivation of Balto-Slavic acute by using the glottalic theory framework of Proto-Indo-European. He proposed that the acute is a reflex of a glottal stop, which has two sources, the merger of PIE laryngeals and the dissolution of PIE pre-glottalized stop (\"voiced stops\" in traditional reconstruction) to glottal stop and voiced stop, according to the Winter's law.\n\nThough elegant, Kortlandt's theory also has some problems. The glottalic theory, which was proposed in the 1970s, is not generally accepted among linguists, and today only a small minority of linguists would consider it a reliable and self-supportive framework onto which to base modern Indo-European research. Also, there is a number of Balto-Slavic lexemes with the acute that are provably not of PIE laryngeal origin, and some of them were a result of apophonical lengthenings occurring only in Balto-Slavic period.\n\nWord-finally, \"*m\" became \"*n\" in Balto-Slavic. Final nasals are not directly preserved in most Balto-Slavic languages, however, making evidence mostly indirect. Old Prussian uniquely preserves final \"*-n\", and there is indeed a clear attestation of the change in the nominative-accusative of neuters, such as \"assaran\" \"lake\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic \"*éźeran\"/\"*áźeran\" < PIE . In the other Baltic languages, no final nasals are retained. Lithuanian has vowel lengthening that reflects earlier nasal vowels, but they could conceivably come from either final \"-n\" or \"-m\" and thus do not provide evidence either way. In Slavic, all word-final consonants are lost in one way or another so there is no direct evidence there either.\n\nHowever, there is indirect evidence in the form of sandhi effects that were preserved in some Slavic pronouns. For example, Old Church Slavonic attests constructions like \"sъ nimь\" \"with him\", which can be traced back to Proto-Balto-Slavic \"*śun eimiš\" where the first word reflects the common Proto-Indo-European preposition \"*ḱom\" \"with\" (compare Latin \"cum\"), and the second reflects the PIE pronominal stem \"*ey-\" (Latin \"is\", German \"er\"). In Slavic, in accordance with the \"Law of Open Syllables\", the final \"-n\" of the preposition was reinterpreted as belonging to the pronoun, which acted to preserve the nasal in its Balto-Slavic form, thus corroborating that it was indeed \"-n\": If the change of \"*-m\" to \"*-n\" had not taken place at an earlier stage, the phrase would have been \"*śum eimiš\", which would have given \"*sъ mimь\" in OCS instead.\n\nThe following changes to vowels in Proto-Balto-Slavic can be noted:\n\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained many of the grammatical features present in Proto-Indo-European.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic made use of seven cases:\nThe eighth Proto-Indo-European case, the ablative, had merged with the genitive case. Some of the inflectional endings for the genitive were replaced with those of the former ablative.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic also distinguished three numbers:\nThe dual was retained into the early Slavic languages, but most modern Slavic languages have lost it. Slovene, Chakavian (a dialect of Serbo-Croatian), and Sorbian are the only remaining Slavic languages that still make consistent use of the dual number. In most other Slavic languages, the dual number is not retained except for historically-paired nouns (eyes, ears, shoulders), certain fixed expressions, and agreement of nouns when used with numbers; it is synchronically often analyzed as genitive singular because of the resemblance in forms. The Baltic languages also used to have a dual number system, but it has become practically obsolete in modern Latvian and Lithuanian.\n\nFinally, Proto-Balto-Slavic nouns could also have one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Many originally neuter nouns in PIE had become masculine in Balto-Slavic so the group was somewhat reduced relative to the others. The modern Slavic languages largely continue the use of three grammatical genders, but modern Baltic languages have merged the neuter gender into the masculine. Lithuanian has no neuter-gender nouns, but in pronouns, participles and numerals, the neuter is retained. Latvian has no neuter gender at all.\n\nAn innovation within Balto-Slavic was the use of the genitive in place of the accusative for the direct object of a negative verb. That feature is still present in its descendants:\n\nA Balto-Slavic innovation to the inflection of adjectives was the creation of a distinct \"definite\" inflection of adjectives by affixing forms of the pronoun \"*ja-\" to existing adjective forms. The inflection had a function resembling that of the definite article 'the' in English: Lithuanian ', Old Church Slavonic ' \"the good\" vs. ', ' \"good\". The distinction is no longer productive in most Slavic languages today, and most Slavic languages preserve a mixture of definite forms and indefinite forms in a single paradigm.\n\nRussian, Czech and Polish for example use the original definite nominative singular forms (Russian \"-ый, -ая, -ое\" (\"-yj, -aja, -oje\"), Polish \"-y, -a, -e\", Czech \"-ý, -á, -é\"). Czech and Polish have lost the indefinite forms except in a few limited uses, while Russian preserves the indefinite nominative forms as the so-called \"short forms\", used in some cases in predicate position. Serbo-Croatian and Slovene still distinguish the two types but only in the masculine nominative singular (definite \"-i\" versus indefinite with no ending). Bulgarian and Macedonian have innovated completely new forms, affixing forms of the demonstrative pronoun \"*t-\" instead.\n\nThe distinction between athematic and thematic verbs was preserved, but athematic verbs were gradually reduced in number. The primary first-person singular endings, athematic \"*-mi\" and thematic \"*-oh₂\", were kept distinct, giving Balto-Slavic \"*-mi\" and \"*-ōˀ\" respectively. The thematic ending was occasionally extended by adding the athematic ending to it, apparently in Balto-Slavic times, resulting in a third ending: \"*-ōˀmi\" > \"*-ōˀm\" > \"*-ōˀn\" > \"*-an\", replacing the original ending in Slavic, reflected as \"*-ǫ\" (Russian \"-у\" (\"-u\"), Polish \"-ę\", Bulgarian \"-a\").\n\nIn many Slavic languages, particularly South and West Slavic, the athematic ending was analogically extended to other verbs and even replaced the thematic ending completely in some languages (Slovene, Serbo-Croatian). In the Baltic languages, only the thematic ending was retained, as Lithuanian \"-ù\" and Latvian \"-u\" (< East Baltic \"*-uoˀ\" < Balto-Slavic \"*-ōˀ\"). In Latvian, the first-person singular form of \"būt\" \"to be\" is \"esmu\", which preserves the original \"*-m-\" of the athematic ending, but it was extended with the thematic ending.\n\nBalto-Slavic replaced the PIE second-person singular ending \"*-si\" with \"*-seHi\" > \"*-sei\" for which the origin is not fully understood. According to Kortlandt, the ending is a combination of the ending \"*-si\" with \"*-eHi\", which he considers to be the original thematic ending. The new ending, \"*-sei\", carried over into all three branches of Balto-Slavic and came to be used in all athematic root verbs in Baltic. In Old Church Slavonic, it completely ousted the older ending. In the other Slavic languages, the original ending generally survives except in the athematic verbs.\n\nThe aspectual distinction between present and aorist was retained and still productive in Proto-Balto-Slavic. It was preserved into early Slavic but was gradually replaced with an innovated aspectual distinction, with a variety of forms. Modern Bulgarian retained the aorist, however, alongside the innovated system, producing a four-way contrast. The Indo-European perfect/stative was falling out of use in Proto-Balto-Slavic and was likely already reduced to relics by Proto-Balto-Slavic times. It survives in Slavic only in the irregular Old Church Slavonic form \"vědě\" \"I know\" (< Balto-Slavic \"*waidai\" < PIE \"*wóyde\", from \"*weyd-\" \"to see\"), which preserves an irregular first-person singular ending, presumed to originate in the perfect.\n\nProto-Indo-European did not originally have an infinitive, but it did have several constructions that served as action nouns. Two of these, the \"-tis\" and \"-tus\" nouns, remained in use into Balto-Slavic and acquired verbal noun and infinitive-like functions. They were not fully integrated into the verb system by Balto-Slavic times, however, and the individual Balto-Slavic languages diverge on the details. In Slavic and the Eastern Baltic languages, the infinitive was formed from a case form of the \"-tis\" noun: Lithuanian \"-ti\", Latvian \"-t\", Proto-Slavic \"*-ti\". Old Prussian, however, has \"-t\" and \"-twei\" as infinitive endings, the latter of which comes from the \"-tus\" noun instead. The shorter \"-t\" could come from either type.\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European accent was completely reworked in Balto-Slavic, with far-reaching consequences for accentual systems of the modern daughter languages. The development was conditioned by several delicate factors, such as the syllable length, presence of a laryngeal closing the syllable, and the position of PIE ictus. There is still no consensus among Balto-Slavists on the precise details of the development of Balto-Slavic accentual system. All modern research is based on the seminal study of Stang (1957), which basically instituted the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology. However, many laws and correspondences have been discovered and are now held to be true by the majority of researchers even if the exact details sometimes remain in dispute.\n\nEarly Balto-Slavic retained a simple accent in which only the placement of the accent was distinctive, but there were no pitch distinctions. The acute register was initially no more than an articulatory feature on certain syllables and could occur independently of accent placement. However, the acute was the trigger for several sound changes that affected the placement of the accent. For example, under Hirt's law, the accent tended to shift leftwards onto a syllable that bore the acute.\n\nOn accented syllables, the acute came to be accompanied by a distinct pitch contour in late Proto-Balto-Slavic. Consequently, accented syllables of any type that could carry the acute register in Proto-Balto-Slavic (listed above) now differed in pitch contour as well as articulation; they had rising or falling pitch (whether accented acute syllables had rising or falling pitch differed by dialect). The tonal accents that emerged from this process are called \"acute accent\" and \"circumflex accent\" in Balto-Slavic linguistics.\n\nSyllables with a single short vowel could not bear the acute register and so also had no tonal distinctions. When accented, they had the same pitch contour (though nondistinctive) as a circumflex-accented syllable. The syllables are said to have \"short accent\".\n\nTo reconstruct the Balto-Slavic accent, the most important are those languages that have retained tonal oppositions: Lithuanian, Latvian, (probably) Old Prussian and the West South Slavic languages of Slovene and Serbo-Croatian. However, one should keep in mind that the prosodical systems of dialects in the aforementioned languages are sometimes very different from those of standard languages. For example, some Croatian dialects like Čakavian and Posavian dialects of Slavonian Štokavian are especially important for Balto-Slavic accentology, as they retain more archaic and complex tonal accentual system than the Neoštokavian dialect on which modern standard varieties of Serbo-Croatian (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian) are based. On the other hand, many dialects have completely lost tonal oppositions (such as some Kajkavian varieties, the Zagreb spoken nonstandard idiom).\n\nA minority view, originating from Vladimir Dybo, considers Balto-Slavic accentuation (based on correspondences in the Germanic, Celtic, and Italic languages) more archaic than Greek-Vedic and therefore closer to Proto-Indo-European.\n\nWhat follows is a short overview of the commonly used diacritical marks for Balto-Slavic (BSl.) accents and/or prosodic features, all based on the example letter \"a\". In each case, there is a crude characterization of the pronunciation in terms of High, Mid, and Low-tone sequences.\n\n\nIn Croatian dialects, especially Čakavian and Posavian, the \"neoacute\" (\"new acute\", a new rising tone) is usually marked with tilde, as \"ã\". Short neoacute (\"short new rising\") is marked as \"à\". Neoacutes represent a post–Proto-Slavic development.\n\nHere is a reverse key to help decode the various diacritical marks:\n\n\nThere are multiple competing systems used for different languages and different periods. The most important are these:\n\nMany nonprosodic marks are also found in various languages in combinations with certain letters. The various combinations of letter and diacritic should normally be viewed as single symbols (i.e. as equivalent to such simple symbols as \"a, b, c ...\").\n\nExamples on vowels:\n\nExamples in consonants:\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic, just like Proto-Indo-European, had a class of nominals with so called \"mobile\" accentuation in which accent alternated between the word stem and the ending. The classes of nominals are usually reconstructed on the basis of Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, which have retained the position of the original PIE accent almost unchanged. However, by comparing the Balto-Slavic evidence, it was discovered that the PIE rules on accent alternations, devised on the basis of Vedic and Greek, do not match those found in Balto-Slavic.\n\nMoreover, nominals that belong to mobile paradigms in Balto-Slavic belong to declension classes that always had fixed accent in PIE paradigms: ā-stems and o-stems. For a long time, the exact relationships between the accentuation of nominals in Balto-Slavic and PIE was one of the most mysterious questions of Indo-European studies, and some parts of the puzzle are still missing.\n\nResearch conducted by Christian Stang, Ferdinand de Saussure, Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Vladimir Dybo has led to a conclusion that Balto-Slavic nominals, with regard to accentuation, could be reduced to two paradigms: fixed and mobile. Nominals of the fixed paradigm had accent on one of the stem syllables, and in the nominals of the mobile paradigm, the accent alternated between the stem and the ending. As shown by Illič-Svityč, Balto-Slavic nominals of the fixed paradigm correspond to the PIE nominals with accent on the root (PIE barytones). The only exception were nominals with the accent on the ending (PIE oxytones) when it was shifted onto the root in Balto Slavic in accordance with Hirt's law; such nominals also have fixed accent in Balto-Slavic.\n\nThe origin of the Balto-Slavic nominals of the mobile paradigm has not been completely determined, with several proposed theories of origin. According to Illič-Svityč, they originate as an analogical development from fixed-accent PIE oxytones. That theory has been criticized as leaving unclear why PIE nominals with fixed accent on the ending would become mobile, as analogies usually lead to uniformity and regularity. According to Meillet and Stang, Balto-Slavic accentual mobility was inherited from PIE consonant and vowel-stems but not for o-stems, where they represent Balto-Slavic innovation. Vedic and Greek lost the accentual mobility in vowel stems, retaining it only in consonant stems. De Saussure explained it as a result of accent retraction in the medially stressed syllables of consonant-stems exhibiting the hysterokinetic paradigm, with vocalic stems subsequently imitating the new accentual patterns by analogy. According to Dybo the position of Balto-Slavic accent is determined by a formula from PIE tones according to the \"valence theory\" developed by the Moscow school, which presupposes lexical tone in PIE. Kortlandt up to 2006 supported the theory of Balto-Slavic losing PIE consonant-stem accentual mobility in nominals, and innovating everywhere else, but after 2006 maintains that the original PIE accentual mobility was preserved in Balto-Slavic in ā-stems (eh₂-stems), i-stems, u-stems and consonant-stems.\n\nThe Balto-Slavic accentual system was further reworked during the Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic period (Dybo's law, Meillet's law, Ivšić's law, etc.), resulting in three Common Slavic accentual paradigms (conventionally indicated using the letters \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), corresponding to four Lithuanian accentual paradigms (indicated with the numbers \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\") in a simple scheme:\n\nThe simplest accentuation is that of nominals which were acuted on the root in Balto-Slavic. They remain accented on the root (\"root\" here is understood in the Proto-Balto-Slavic, not the PIE sense) throughout the paradigm in Baltic (Lithuanian \"first accentual paradigm\") and Slavic (\"accent paradigm a\").\n\n\nIn the nouns with non-mobile initial accent, which did not have an acuted root syllable, both Lithuanian and Slavic had an independent accent shift occur, from the root to the ending. In Lithuanian, they are the nouns of the \"second accent paradigm\" and in Slavic, the \"accent paradigm b\".\n\nLithuanian noun \"rankà\" \"hand\" etymologically corresponds to Russian \"ruká\" and Serbo-Croatian \"rúka\", but both became mobile in a later Common Slavic development so the reflexes of the Proto-Slavic noun \"*juxá\" \"soup\" are listed instead.\n\n\nNominals with mobile accent had in some cases an accented first syllable, in others an accented ending.\n\nLithuanian distinguishes two accent paradigms of these nominals, depending on whether the root was acuted, as in the fixed paradigm, or not.\n\nIn Proto-Slavic, the operation of Meillet's law converted acute roots to circumflexed in mobile nominals, so that the split found in Lithuanian does not occur. All nominals with mobile accentuation in Balto-Slavic belong to one accent paradigm in Slavic, \"accent paradigm C\".\n\n\nIn the later Balto-Slavic languages, the acute articulation itself was often lost, leaving only the pitch distinction on accented syllables as the reflex. There, \"acute\" is only a type of pitch accent, rather than a specific articulatory feature. The Slavic languages have no trace of the acute articulation and preserve only tonal distinctions although most have since lost even those, in their development from Proto-Slavic. The East Baltic languages preserve some traces of the original acute articulation, in the form of the so-called \"broken tone\", the is a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle of it, typically denoted by a circumflex diacritic, not to be confused with the circumflex accent: \"â\" . The broken tone is preserved in syllables in certain dialects of Latvian and Lithuanian. The broken tone can occur on unaccented syllables so it is not actually a tone but a register distinction, much like the Danish \"stød\" or the \"ngã\" tone in Northern Vietnamese.\n\nThe short accent was preserved as such in both the Baltic and Slavic languages, but its lengthening could be triggered by certain conditions. For example, in Lithuanian, vowels /a/ and /e/ were lengthened when they initially bore short accent in open syllable, and rising tone emerged, marked with tilde sign \"ã\". Compare:\n\nThe most direct continuation of the acute is in Latvian, particularly in the three-tone central dialects. There, the acute register is directly continued as a broken tone (\"lauztā\") in originally unstressed syllables, marked with a circumflex diacritic: \"luôgs\" \"window\". In originally-stressed syllables, the acute register is continued as a rising or lengthened intonation (\"stieptā\"), marked with a tilde: \"luõks\" \"spring onion\". The circumflex register is generally continued as a falling intonation (\"krītošā\"), marked with a grave accent: \"lùoks\" \"arch, bow\". It can occur on all syllables: locative plural \"gal̂vâs\" \"on the heads\" (compare: Lithuanian \"galvosè\" with stress on a short final vowel, deleted in Latvian), including monosyllables: \"dêt\" \"to lay eggs\" < \"*dêtì\".\n\nIn Lithuanian, the distinction between acute and circumflex is not preserved in unstressed syllables. In Standard Lithuanian, based on the Aukštaitian dialect, the acute becomes a falling tone (so-called \"Lithuanian metatony\") and is marked with an acute accent, and the circumflex becomes a rising tone, marked with a tilde. In diphthongs, the acute accent is placed on the first letter of the diphthong while the tilde marking rising tone (the original circumflex) is placed on the second letter. In diphthongs with a sonorant as a second part, the same convention is used, but the acute accent is replaced with a grave accent: Lithuanian \"pìlnas\" 'full' < PIE ). Word-finally, the acute was regularly shortened: \"gerà\" 'good' (indefinite adjective) : \"geróji\" 'the good' (definite adjective). That rule is called Leskien's law after the German neogrammarian August Leskien.\n\nThe shortening operated according to Leskien's law after the Lithuanian metatony. In monosyllabic words, the acute became circumflexed. Metatonical retraction of the accent from the final syllable to the penultimate syllable also created a circumflex automatically.\n\nIn the Žemaitian (Samogitian) dialects of Lithuanian, the usual reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in a stressed syllable is a broken tone like Latvian: Žemaitian (Kretinga) \"ộmž́iọs\" \"age, century\" = standard \"ámžius\".\n\nIn Old Prussian, the acute was reflected probably as a rising tone and circumflex as a falling tone. The marks on long vowels and diphthongs in Abel Will's translation of Martin Luther's \"Enchiridion\" point to that conclusion. It is the only accented Old Prussian text preserved. Diphthongs that correspond to a reconstructable Balto-Slavic acute are generally long in the second part of the diphthong, and those corresponding to a Balto–Slavic circumflex are generally long in the first part.\n\nIn Proto-Slavic, the acute was lost as an articulatory feature and retained only as a tonal distinction on accented syllables. The acute produced a rising tone and the circumflex a falling tone, as in Latvian and Old Prussian.\n\nSeveral developments in Late Common Slavic affected vowel length. Syllables that were originally short could lengthen, and those originally long could shorten. However, the long vowels also acquired different quality from the short ones so lengthenings and shortenings did not cause them to merge.\n\nInstead, the vowels remained separate, causing the number of distinct vowels to almost double. Thus, differences vowel quality reflected older length distinctions while new vowel length distinctions were conditioned by accent type and placement. Consequently, in the Slavic languages that retain it, vowel length is often a suprasegmental feature tied to the accentual system rather phonemes. In Czech, Slovak and Old Polish, the mobile accent was lost in favour of fixed stress, which rephonemicised the older accentual length distinctions. Thus, the languages have long vowels as distinct phonemes, but they do not reflect the original Proto-Slavic length distinctions.\n\nIn all Slavic languages, the acute was shortened when it fell on a long vowel. A new rising accent (the \"neoacute\"), generally long, developed from retraction of the stress from a weak yer vowel (later usually lost). The short rising accent that developed from the old acute (and in some circumstances, the neoacute) was later lengthened again in a number of Slavic languages (such as Russian, Czech, Slovenian). The circumflex was shortened in some dialects as well (such as Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovak). Direct continuation of the acute vs. circumflex difference as a tonal distinction occurs only in archaic Serbo–Croatian dialects (such as Chakavian) and, to some extent, Slovenian (although the relationship between Slovenian and Proto-Slavic tones and accent position is complex).\n\nIn addition, the Proto-Slavic tonal distinction on liquid diphthongs is reflected fairly directly in Russian as a multisyllable accent shape (pleophony): *ôr (falling) > \"óro\", *ór (rising) > \"oró\". In some other languages (most notably Czech and standard Neoshtokavian Serbo-Croatian), the acute vs. circumflex distinction is continued as a length distinction (although in all languages, both long and short vowels have other sources as well). The length-from-tone distinction no longer exists in Russian.\n\nHere is a table of basic accentual correspondences of the first syllable of a word:\nScholars raised questions regarding the possible relationship between Slavic and Baltic languages as early as the late 18th century. In 1802 the influential German scholar of Slavic languages and history August Ludwig von Schlözer described how his understanding of this relationship had changed over the years: whereas previously he had argued that the 'Latvian' or 'Old-Prussian' peoples spoke languages that belonged to the Slavic group, he had come to see them as an independent language family.\n\nIt was formerly thought that Balto-Slavic split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, which both developed as a single common language for some time afterwards. More recently, scholarship suggests that Baltic was not a single branch of Balto-Slavic.\n\n\n"}

Later, Scorchy traveled the world fighting spies and foreign aggression.\n\nCharles Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic flight increased interest in aviation, and together with several other flight-related adventure strips, \"Scorchy Smith\" debuted in 1930, created by John Terry for AP Newsfeatures. When Terry developed fatal tuberculosis in 1933, the strip was assigned to Noel Sickles; Sickles' first credited strip ran on April 2, 1934. Sickles increased the popularity of \"Scorchy Smith\", which became AP's leading strip. Sickles' impressionistic style and cinematic compositions, plus his frequent use of areas of pure black ink and Zipatone shading, was dramatically different from any other cartoonist at the time. Milton Caniff's mastery of the medium is frequently attributed to his collaborations with Sickles.\n\nAfter working on the strip for two years, Sickles estimated that \"Scorchy Smith\" was running in about 250 newspapers, which would make the syndicate about $2,500 a month. He only got paid $125 a month, so he asked the syndicate for a raise. He didn't get it, so he quit the strip to become a commercial illustrator. His last strip ran on October 24, 1936.\n\nSickles was succeeded by Bert Christman, who began drawing and scripting the strip November 23, 1936. Christman, a cartoonist who also co-created the \"Sandman\" for DC Comics, joined the U.S. Navy as an aviation cadet in June 1938, resigning his commission three years later to join the American Volunteer Group being recruited to fly for the Chinese Air Force. He was shot down, bailed out, then strafed and killed in Burma as a pilot with the AVG, by then famous as the Flying Tigers.\n\nAfter Christman left \"Scorchy Smith\", a succession of artists handled the strip, including Howell Dodd and Frank Robbins, who began signing the strip on May 22, 1939. Robbins, who had never had a feature of his own before, soon developed a solid reputation for creating comic-strip adventure. A wartime sequence set in Russia drew the following comment.\"...\"formidable reality: it creates the sense of deep snows, it is full of bitter, bloody struggle\"\". In 1944, he was hired by King Features Syndicate, where he created \"Johnny Hazard\", another pilot-adventurer. Robbins' last strip ran March 12, 1944.\n\nAfter Robbins left the strip, it was taken on by Edmund Good (1944-1946), Rodlow Willard (1946–1953), Alvin Hollingsworth (1953-1954), George Tuska (1954–1959), and John Milt Morris (1959–1961). The strip ended on December 30, 1961.. Hollingsworth was long believed the last to do Sundays as well as dailies, but using online newspaper sources it was discovered that George Tuska did a daily version until July 25 1959 with AP staff artist John Morris continuing into 1961. and a two tier Sunday version until the end of 1955. The last story George Tuska did was published (and possibly drawn) at the same time as the first strips of his new job, Buck Rogers .\n\n\"Scorchy Smith\" was reprinted in \"Famous Funnies\" and in two collections published by Nostalgia Press in the 1970s.\n\nThe daily strip from July 27, 1936, through July 30, 1938 and May 22, 1939 through March 11, 1944 by Noel Sickles, Bert Christman and Frank Robbins, have been reprinted in \"Big Fun Comics\" #1–9, (published by American Comic Archive.\n\nIn 2008, IDW Publishing published via their imprint; The Library of American Comics, \"Scorchy Smith and the Art of Noel Sickles\", which reprints the complete 1933–36 \"Scorchy Smith\" run by Sickles. \n\n"}

Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.\n\nFaustina Kowalska, a Polish nun, reported visions and visitations from Jesus and conversations with him. He asked her to paint the vision of his merciful divinity being poured from his Sacred Heart and specifically asked for a feast of Divine Mercy to be established on the first Sunday after Easter Sunday, so that mankind would take refuge in him:\n\nIn several entries in , Kowalska reported promises of grace and mercy associated to the Feast of Divine Mercy on Mercy Sunday:\n\nOn March 23, 1937, Kowalska wrote in her diary (Notebook III, item 1044) that she had a vision that the feast of Divine Mercy would be celebrated in her local chapel, and would be attended by large crowds, and that the same celebration would be held in Rome attended by the pope. She wrote:\n\"The crowd was so enormous that the eye could not take it all in. Everyone was participating in the celebrations.\"\n\nDivine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. Kowalska wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.\n\nThe first Mass during which the Divine Mercy image was displayed was on April 28, 1935 (the Feast of Divine Mercy), the second Sunday of Easter, and was attended by Kowalska. (Diary of St. Faustina, item 420). April 28, 1935 was also the celebration of the end of the \"Jubilee of the Redemption\" by Pope Pius XI. Michael Sopocko (Kowalska's confessor) celebrated the Mass that Sunday and obtained permission to place the image within the Gate of Dawn church in Vilnius during the Mass.\n\nThe devotion was actively promoted by Pope John Paul II. On April 30, 2000, the Canonization of Faustina Kowalska took place and the second Sunday of Easter was officially designated as the Sunday of the Divine Mercy (Dominica II Paschae seu de divina misericordia) in the General Roman Calendar. On April 22, 2001, which was one year after establishing Divine Mercy Sunday, Pope John Paul II re-emphasized its message in the resurrection context of Easter:\nJesus said to St. Faustyna one day: \"Humanity will never find peace until it turns with trust to Divine Mercy\". Divine Mercy! This is the Easter gift that the Church receives from the risen Christ and offers to humanity.\nThe devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics. The \"Divine Mercy image\" is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.\n\nThe liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy – the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\nHeavenly Father and God of Mercy, We no longer look for Jesus among the dead, for He is alive and has become the Lord of Life.\nThis opening prayer refers to divine mercy as the key element in the plan of God for salvation and emphasizes the belief that it was through mercy that God gave his only son for the redemption of mankind, after the fall of Adam.\n\nJohn Paul II, who died in April 2005 on the vigil of Divine Mercy Sunday, was himself beatified on Divine Mercy Sunday, May 1, 2011, by his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, and was canonized together with Pope John XXIII on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 27, 2014, by Pope Francis.\n\nIn June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, and the grants were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary. Priests are encouraged on that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.\n\nThe plenary indulgence is obtained by observing the usual dispositions that are in place for the granting of this grace through the intercession of the Catholic Church:\n\n\nAdditionally, the faithful who, for a justified reason beyond their control, are unable to go to a church or chapel may obtain an indulgence with the recitation of the Our Father and Creed before an image of Jesus, adding the prayer \"Merciful Jesus, I trust in you\", with the conditions of detachment of sin, and intention to fulfill the dispositions above as soon as possible.\n\nIf even this is impossible to achieve, the indulgence can obtained by the faithful if they \"united with those carrying out the prescribed practice for obtaining the indulgence in the usual way\", and offer to Jesus a prayer and their sufferings, again with the resolution of fulfilling the normal conditions at the earliest opportunity\n\n"}

His research interests were in the areas of star formation and structure, especially stellar magnetism and astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics. He was awarded both the Eddington Medal (1993) and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (for Astronomy, 2002). Following his retirement, he wrote several obituaries and biographical articles on physicists and astrophysicists.\n\nLeon Mestel was born on 5 August 1927 in Melbourne, Australia to Solomon Mestel, a rabbi and Rachel (née Brodetsky), a schoolteacher and sister of Selig Brodetsky. With his family, he migrated to England at the age of three, where he lived in Forest Gate, east London. He was educated at West Ham Secondary School, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA in 1948 and his PhD in 1952.\n\nHe married Sylvia Louise Cole (d. 2014) in 1951, and they had two sons, Ben and Jonathan and two daughters Rosie and Leo. One of his sons is Jonathan Mestel (born 1957), a mathematics professor and chess grandmaster. In 1982, as part of a memorial series of annual lectures at the University of Leeds commemorating his maternal uncle, Leon Mestel gave the 23rd Selig Brodetsky Memorial Lecture, titled \"Astronomy: A Mirror to Physics\".\n\nMestel's research interests were in the area of astrophysics, including: stellar structure, stellar evolution, star formation, cosmic magnetism and pulsar electrodynamics.\n\nAt the time he was completing his PhD, Mestel took a position as an ICI Research Fellow at the Department of Mathematics in the University of Leeds, carrying out research there in the three-year period from 1951 to 1954. Also during this period, in 1952, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS). Mestel then spent the academic year of 1954–5 as a Commonwealth Fund Fellow at the Observatory at Princeton University.\n\nReturning to England, he was a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Cambridge for eleven years from 1955 to 1966, first as an assistant lecturer (1955–1958) and then as a full lecturer (1958–1966). While at Cambridge, he was a Fellow of St John's College from 1957 to 1966. This time at Cambridge included a period as a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, during the academic year of 1961–2.\n\nIn 1963, he published a paper describing a phenomenon that occurs during galaxy and star formation that came to be known as a 'Mestel disk'.\n\nMestel left Cambridge in 1966 after being appointed to the position of professor at the University of Manchester, but before taking up his appointment there he spent the academic year of 1966–7 as JFK Fellow at the Weizmann Institute, Israel. Returning to England, he spent six years as professor of applied mathematics in Manchester (1967–1973). The fourth and final stage of his career was as professor of astronomy at the University of Sussex, a position he took up in 1973 and held for nineteen years.\n\nMestel was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1977. He retired in 1992, becoming Emeritus Professor at Sussex.\n\n\nAfter retiring, Mestel wrote several obituaries and biographical articles on physicists and astrophysicists for publications such as \"The Independent\", the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society. Those for whom Mestel wrote obituaries and articles include Martin Schwarzschild, Roger John Tayler, William McCrea, Hermann Bondi, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, and Thomas George Cowling. Mestel also contributed the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Selig Brodetsky.\n\nIn 2002, Mestel was an invited speaker at a conference held in Cardiff, Wales, in memory of Fred Hoyle. In 2004, together with John D. Barrow, Mestel organised a Commemoration Meeting at the Royal Astronomical Society to mark 60 years since the death of Arthur Eddington, publishing a paper on Eddington later the same year. In 2009, Mestel featured in \"Portraits of Astronomers\", a book by Lucinda Douglas-Menzies with portraits of thirty-eight leading UK astronomers. In 2008, he moved back to his family in Cambridge, where he died in September 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1877800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877800", "title": "Montgomery County Police Department", "text": "Montgomery County Police Department\n\nThe Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD), officially the Montgomery County Department of Police (MCP), is a nationally accredited agency and the primary law enforcement agency of Montgomery County, Maryland, providing the full spectrum of policing services to the entire county.\n\nEstablished in July 1922, the MCPD is headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and in addition to its primary duties, it also provides aid and assistance to other police departments including the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and in neighboring jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia, Howard County, Baltimore City, and Prince George's County as requested by authority.\n\nThe MCPD was established in early July 1922, absorbing some responsibilities from the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) through Chapter 259 of the Acts of 1922. At the time, the department was designated to consist of three to six officers that were appointed to two-year terms by the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, with one officer designated as the chief.\n\nThe first chief of the MCPD was Charles T. \"Chas\" Cooley, who was from Frederick County, Maryland and served as a soldier in the Spanish–American War.\n\nIn July 1924, William L. Aud became the MCPD's chief. He was the Sheriff of Montgomery County from 1917 to 1919.\n\nIn 1927, the department was enlarged to twenty officers by Chapter 299 of the Acts of 1927.\n\nFrom 1922 until 1935, the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners designated one police officer from within the MCPD's ranks to serve as its chief. In 1935, through Chapter 9 of the Acts of 1935, the regulations were changed so that the chief could be appointed from any source, at the discretion of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. In 1948, when Montgomery County transitioned to a charter government, the responsibilities of appointing chiefs for the MCPD was transferred to the Montgomery County Executive.\n\nIn 1927, the MCPD had 20 policemen. In 1931, the MCPD had 27 policemen, and by 1939, the MCPD had 35 policemen.\n\nFrom 1927 to 1954, the MCPD was headquartered at the lower level of the Montgomery County Courthouse.\n\nIn February 1939, Charles M. Orme became the MCPD's chief. He fought as a soldier in World War I and previous served in the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office as a deputy from 1925 to 1939. Under his tenure the MCPD grew from 35 policemen to 177 policemen.\n\nBy 1955, the MCPD had grown to have 177 policemen.\n\nIn April 1955, James Stephen McAuliffe, Sr. became the MCPD's chief. He was the 11th policeman ever hired by the MCPD.\n\nOver the course of several decades, the MCPD would eventually grow to over a thousand officers.\n\nIn 1971, Kenneth Winstead Watkins became the MCPD's chief. Serving with the department since 1946, he was the last policeman to serve as the MCPD's head when it was still known as \"superintendent\". After his retirement, the title of the MCPD's head policeman was changed to \"chief\".\n\nOn March 29, 1971, Carol A. Mehrling joined the MCPD as its first female police officer. She would eventually become its first female police chief in 1995, more than two decades later.\n\nIn 1976, the title of the head of the MCPD was changed from superintendent to chief. Also that same year, Robert DiGrazia, a former Boston Police Commissioner, became the MCPD's chief, intending to brings new changes to the department. However, he became unpopular with many officers in the department as they believed he was too sharply critical and demanding of them. As a result, he was removed from his position by the county executive in December 1978. Donald E. Brooks became the MCPD's acting chief after DiGrazia was dismissed.\n\nIn 1979, a computerized fingerprinting system was installed for use by the MCPD.\n\nIn April 1979, Bernard Crooke, a former MPDC officer, became the MCPD's chief. He would serve in that capacity before dying in office in February 1988. After Crooke died, Donald E. Brooks became the MCPD's acting chief.\n\nBy the 1980s, the MCPD had 750 officers, and by September 1991 it had 849 officers.\n\nIn March 1981, MCPD policeman Philip Carl Metz was shot and killed while confronting a gang of armed robbers at a Silver Spring business. Security guard David Myers was also killed by the robbers. Metz is the most recent MCPD policeman to have been deliberately murdered in the line of duty by gunfire.\n\nOn September 24, 1991, Clarence Edwards became the chief of the MCPD, becoming the department's first African American chief as well as the first African American chief of a Maryland county-level police department. He was a former U.S. Park Police (USPP) officer for 21 years and had joined the USPP in September 1963. He also served in the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.\n\nHowever, in December 1994, Edwards was relieved of his position by Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan, who had taken office that same month, a move which angered the local chapter of the NAACP. Edwards was succeeded by interim MCPD chief Carol A. Mehrling, who joined the MCPD on March 29, 1971. On February 2, 1995, Mehrling was chosen by Duncan to be the MCPD's fourteenth chief, becoming the department's first female chief. The MCPD was, at the time, the second-largest police department in the United States to be headed by a woman.\n\nOn February 17, 1997, the local Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) body voted overwhelmingly in passing a resolution of no confidence in Mehrling's abilities as chief, claiming that she was not doing enough to defend MCPD officers against accusations of misconduct and abuse by the NAACP. As a result of these allegations, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into the operations of the MCPD. On November 17, 1998, Mehrling announced that she would retire from the MCPD and did so on February 3, 1999, with Thomas Evans becoming the acting chief.\n\nThroughout much of the 1990s, the MCPD faced numerous allegations of abuse, excessive force, and misconduct, including fatal officer-involved shootings in Wheaton and Silver Spring in April 1999 and March 1999, respectively. These accusations resulted in the U.S. Justice Department investigating the department for three years.\nAlthough there had been certain public scrutiny about specific police shootings involving MCP officers, it has been determined that they were all justified under the Constitution, federal and state laws, and department policy. The only exception is when an on duty MCP officer shot and wounded a romantic rival in the Wheaton area. The MCP and the state's attorney's office have a long-standing practice of investigating, prosecuting and terminating corrupt MCP officers, although it is a very uncommon occurrence within MCP compared to other large police departments across the United States.\n\nOn August 2, 1999, Charles A. Moose became the fifteenth MCP chief, during a time when the MCP was nearing the end of a three-year-long U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of misconduct and abuse committed by its officers. Moose was a U.S. Air Force commissioned officer and was the former chief of the Portland Bureau of Police.\n\nBy the end of 1999, crime in Montgomery County was lower than at the start of the decade, with total violent crime down 16 percent, rapes down 23 percent, robberies down 8 percent, aggravated assaults down 19 percent, and overall crime down 9 percent.\n\nOn January 14, 2000, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between the U.S. Department of Justice and the MCP regarding abuses and misconduct committed by the latter. The agreement detailed how the MCPD was to address and correct the misconduct and abuses committed by its officers.\n\nOn March 12, 2002, John A. King, on Moose's recommendation, was unanimously approved as the MCPD's assistant chief by the county council, after Alan G. Rodbell retired on December 23, 2001 to fill a law enforcement job position in Arizonan city of Scottsdale.\n\nIn October 2002, several of the D.C. sniper attacks occurred in Montgomery County. Moose and the MCP played a major role in the ensuing investigation. In June 2003, Moose resigned amid controversy over a book he helped author alongside Charles Fleming, that detailed Moose's experiences during the D.C. sniper attacks. The county government objected in stating that the MCPD chief was not allowed to profit privately from official duties; the book itself was released on September 15, 2003.\nIn the aftermath, Moose eventually became a police officer in Honolulu, Hawaii. During the sniper case, he was frequently criticized for his lack of public speaking abilities during interviews with the news media.\n\nAfter resigning as the MCPD's chief in June 2003, Moose was succeeded by William C. \"Bill\" O'Toole, who served as the MCPD's acting chief until a new chief could be found. O'Toole was the MCPD's assistant chief previously; he himself retired from the MCPD on August 1, 2006.\n\nOn January 30, 2004, J. Thomas Manger, a former officer of the Fairfax County Police Department (FCPD), became the sixteenth MCPD chief. Manger is a graduate of the FBI National Academy and served as the FCPD's acting chief before becoming its chief.\n\nOn October 5, 2007, ten MCPD officers were charged in a \"double-dipping\" probe. The accused officers were alleged to have improperly billed Grady Management, a Silver Spring real estate firm, for more than 8,900 hours for which they also were compensated by the police. The accused improperly earned more than $200,000.\nEach officer involved in the scheme were either fired, resigned, forced to retire or otherwise disciplined depending on their individual involvement.\n\nFrom its founding until 2008, the MCPD wore khaki-colored uniforms. However, in 2008, the MCPD switched to its current black-colored uniforms. These uniforms are usually worn with a ballistic vest on top of the uniform's shirt, with the word \"POLICE\" embroidered onto the back. However, formal uniforms for ceremonial occasions are still khaki and olive-colored.\n\nIn 2010, the MCPD shot and killed an armed hostage-taker at the Discovery Communications building in Silver Spring after he attempted to chase after his hostages when they attempted to flee.\nAn MCP officer that was in the area of the building at the time was awarded for his actions for placing himself inside of the building, communicating with on duty officers and saving multiple lives.\n\nThe MCPD's total number of personnel declined from 2010 to 2012 due to the recession and budget county problems. In 2010, the MCPD had an authorized strength of 1,200 sworn officers, but by January 2012 it only had 1,159.\n\nUntil 2012, the MCPD was headquartered at 2350 Research Boulevard in the county seat of Rockville. In 2012, the MCPD moved its headquarters from Rockville, where it had been headquartered for forty years, to the Montgomery County Public Safety Headquarters, located at 100 Edison Park Drive in Gaithersburg, Maryland, located around four miles from the former MCPD headquarters. The process of transferring the MCPD's headquarters to its new location took around two years at a cost of 108.5 million dollars. The remodeling and moving phases took an extended period of time due to the legal requirements of housing a police district station along with administrative offices in the same building. The MCPD shares the building with other county agencies, such as the Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service (MCFRS) and Montgomery County Office of Homeland Security. The MCP's 1st District station was also consolidated into this new headquarters. The building which houses the headquarters, located near Lake Placid, was built in the 1960s and was originally used by the National Geographic Society, and later by General Electric (GE). The building was leased to the county government before a purchase date of 2014 was finalized. Since the building officially opened as the county public safety HQ, at least two incidents have occurred (a small explosive device was detonated, and a separate incident of an entranceway glass door being shattered). The county is seeking ways to improve security at the location.\n\nOn the evening of January 30, 2014, an MCPD officer shot and killed his son at their home in Gaithersburg as the latter was stabbing the officer's wife, who later died.\n\nIn December 2015, an MCP officer was struck and killed in Rockville by an automobile being driven by an inebriated person. That officer, Noah Leotta, was working a DUI enforcement assignment at the time. Maryland legislature later passed Noah's Law which provides enhanced penalties for persons arrested for driving under the influence. https://www.officernoahaleottafoundation.org/meet-noah-a-leotta/\nIn April 2019, J. Thomas Manger retired as the MCP's chief of police. He was succeeded by Marcus Jones a few months later.\n\nThe MCPD is divided into four bureaus and the Office of the Chief.\n\nThe MCPD is headquartered at the J. Thomas Manger Public Safety Headquarters at 100 Edison Park Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland, near Lake Placid. It was formerly headquartered at 2350 Research Boulevard in the county seat of Rockville.\n\nThe Office of the Chief is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the MCP. This section also contains Community Services, Internal Affairs, Legal and Labor, Media Services, and Stress Management.\n\nThe current chief of police is long-time MCP officer Marcus Jones, who was sworn in on November 8, 2019. He was preceded in office by J. Thomas Manger, who had held the office since January 30, 2004. He is the MCPD's 16th chief. In 2019, the public safety headquarters was renamed honoring former Chief Manger.\n\nUntil 1976, the MCP's head policeman was known as its \"superintendent\", after which it was changed to its present title of \"chief\".\n\nThe Field Services Bureau contains the general policing districts and the Special Operations Division.\n\nThe Special Operations Division (SOD), consists of the K-9 Unit, Emergency Services Unit, Police Community Action Team, Special Events Response Team, and Tactical Unit.\n\nThe Investigative Services Bureau is responsible for providing specialized police services such as (but not limited to) the following: Criminal Investigations Division (CID), Auto Theft, Fraud, Family Crimes, Major Crimes, and Special Investigations Division.\n\nThe Management Services Bureau is a largely non-sworn, civilian support bureau. It contains Animal Control, Emergency Communications, Budget, Personnel, Training, and other support services.\n\n\nThe Montgomery County Police Department utilizes a fleet of Ford, Dodge and Chevrolet patrol cars (\"cruisers\" per MCP terminology) Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, Dodge Chargers, Chevrolet Impalas, Chevrolet Caprices, Dodge Magnums, Harley-Davidson Police Edition motorcycles, and others. The vehicles use LED lightbars with blue \"steady-burn\" diodes as an option during routine patrols for high visibility purposes, although it is currently not required by department policy. In the past, the MCP used third-generation Dodge Caravans.\n\nThe MCP also uses Lenco BearCats for emergency situations that require an armored vehicle. The Emergency Services Unit (ESU) utilizes other types of vehicles to supplement the fleet in a support capacity for the Emergency Response Team (ERT ... also known as SWAT) and for major incidents. These include a command bus and other support vehicles.\n\nOfficers are issued the Glock Model 17 9mm caliber pistol as the standard issue sidearm. Other Glock 9mm models are available to officers depending on their rank and assignment. The Glock Model 17 replaced the previous issue Models 22, 23 and 27 in .40 caliber. Prior to the Glock, officers were issued a 9mm Beretta 92 Beretta which did not have a safety on it. It was a custom Beretta model created for MCP and other police agencies. Detectives were once issued Smith & Wesson pistols as their sidearm.\nPatrol officers also have the option of carrying a Remington 870 12 gauge shotgun, a Benelli 12 gauge shotgun, or a 5.56 caliber patrol rifle, similar to an M4 carbine.\n\nThe issued MCP badge has been manufactured by Hahn, Blackinton and CW Nielsen. By 2019, the contracted manufacturer of issued MCP badges is Smith & Warren. It has changed once from a plain, common style Maryland shield badge to an eagle-topped badge. The badge wording, from top to bottom, reads POLICE (RANK) MONTGOMERY COUNTY MD. MCP also uses the Maryland coat of arms as the center piece of the badge instead of a full color state seal.\n\nThe national non-emergency contact number for the MCP and Montgomery County Emergency Communications Center (ECC) is (301) 279–8000. Locally, residents and visitors can call 911 in case of emergencies ONLY. The ECC is staffed 27/7/365. Montgomery County borders Washington, D.C., and is home to over 1 Million residents and growing. The population increases during the average work week. Montgomery County suffers from the usual urban and suburban crime rate such as homicide, rape, robbery, assault and other violent, gang and drug-related crime as any other major metropolitan area. When comparing Montgomery County to police staffing and population, it is slightly below the expected national average. Montgomery County is considered to be one of the wealthiest and most populated areas of the United States. Development, traffic congestion and crime is at its peak, and there are currently plans at the state and local levels to address it.\n\n\n\n"}

They are located in the 11th district, Simmering. They were used from 1899 to 1984 as gas storage tanks. After the changeover from town gas to natural gas between 1969 and 1978, they were no longer used and were shut down. Only the brick exterior front walls were preserved. The structures have found new residential and commercial use in modern times.\n\nThe Gasometers were built from 1896 to 1899 in the Simmering district of Vienna near the \"Gaswerk Simmering\" gas works of the district. The containers were used to help supply Vienna with town gas, facilities which had previously been provided by the English firm Inter Continental Gas Association (ICGA). Once the contracts with the ICGA expired, the city decided to construct facilities to handle its own gas needs. At the time, the design was the largest in all of Europe.\n\nThe Gasometers were retired in 1984 due to new technologies in gasometer construction, as well as the city's conversion from town gas and coal gas to natural gas. Gas can be stored underground or in modern high-pressure gas storage spheres under much higher pressures and in smaller volumes than the relatively large gasometers. In 1978, they were designated as protected historic landmarks.\n\nVienna undertook a remodelling and revitalization of the protected monuments and in 1995 called for ideas for the new use of the structures. The chosen designs by the architects Jean Nouvel (Gasometer A), Coop Himmelblau (Gasometer B), Manfred Wehdorn (Gasometer C) and Wilhelm Holzbauer (Gasometer D) were completed between 1999 and 2001. Each gasometer was divided into several zones for living (apartments in the top), working (offices in the middle floors) and entertainment and shopping (shopping malls in the ground floors). The shopping mall levels in each gasometer are connected to the others by skybridges. The historic exterior wall was conserved. One of the ideas rejected for the project was the plan by architect Manfred Wehdorn to use the Gasometers for hotels and facilities for the planned World Expo in Vienna and Budapest.\n\nOn 30 October 2001, the mayor attended the official grand opening of the Gasometers, but people had begun moving in as early as May 2001.\n\nThe Gasometers are four cylindrical telescopic gas containers, each with a volume of about 90,000 m³ seated in a water basin; each is enclosed by a red-brick facade. They are each 70 meters tall and 60 meters in diameter. The Gasometers were gutted during the remodelling and only the brick exterior and parts of the roof were left standing.\n\nCoal gas was dry-distilled from coal and was stored in these containers before it was distributed into the city gas network. The \"town gas\" was originally used only by the street lamps, but in 1910, its use for cooking and heating in private homes was introduced.\n\nIndoor facilities include a music hall (capacity 2000–3000 people), movie theatre, student dormitory, municipal archive, and so on. There are about 800 apartments (two thirds within the historic brick walls) with 1600 regular tenants, as well as about 70 student apartments with 250 students in residence.\n\n"}

He prided himself rather on being a non-mathematical statistician, and said that the thing that frightened him most in his life was when Maurice Kendall asked him to teach a course on analysis of variance at the LSE.\n\nClaus Adolf Moser was born in Berlin in 1922. His father was Dr Ernst (Ernest) Moser (1885–1957), owner of the private bank Georg Fromberg & Co. in Berlin (est. 1882, \"aryanized\" in 1936). His mother was Lotte (née Goldberg, 1897–1976), a talented amateur musician. In 1936 he moved to England with his parents and his brother Heinz Peter August. He went to Frensham Heights School and the London School of Economics (LSE). Despite being Jewish, in 1940, he was interned as an enemy alien in Huyton Camp.\n\nAfter four months, he was released and served in the Royal Air Force, 1943–1946. He then returned to LSE as Assistant Lecturer, then Lecturer, in Statistics, 1946–1955; Reader in Social Statistics, 1955–1961; Professor of Social Statistics, 1961–1970; Visiting Professor of Social Statistics, 1970–1975.\n\nIn 1965 he was elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1965 New Year Honours, and in 1965, he applied for a job at the Central Statistical Office but was rejected, as a former enemy alien. However, this did not seem to be a problem when in 1967 Harold Wilson appointed him Director of the Central Statistical Office. He was made a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in the 1973 New Year Honours. He resigned as Director of the Central Statistical Office in 1978.\n\nHe held a very wide variety of posts. These included:\n\n\nHe was made a life peer with the title Baron Moser, of Regent's Park in the London Borough of Camden on 23 June 2001. Other honours included the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, 1996, Commandeur de l'Ordre National du Mérite (France), 1976; Commander's Cross, Order of Merit (Germany), 1985.\n\nMoser also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1995.\n\nMoser died in Switzerland on 4 September 2015, following a stroke.\n\nMoser was honorary Chancellor at Keele University at a time of rapid change after funding cuts in the early 80s, and appointment of a full-time vice-chancellor to reduce staff / student ratios further after that first emergency. Keele's funding per student was reduced by a third and Oxford's by a thirtieth from similar amounts per head in the 70s.\n\nIn 1997 Moser participated in a ceremony to mark the start of construction of the Claus Moser Research Centre, a dedicated research facility for the Humanities and Social Sciences. He returned to the university in June 2008 to participate in the official opening of the £3.5m building.\n\n\n"}
