His sculptures are typically placed in the eye of a needle or on the head of a pin. A single sculpture can be as small as 0.005 mm (0.0002 in).\n\nAs a child with undiagnosed dyslexia, Willard Wigan was ridiculed in class by his primary school teachers for not learning to read. Wigan attributes his early drive in sculpting, which began at the age of five, to his need to escape from the derision of teachers and classmates. He wanted to show the world that nothing did not exist, deducing that if people were unable to view his work, then they would not be in any position to criticise it. Wigan has since aimed to make even smaller artworks, visible only with a microscope.\n\nIn July 2007 he was made an MBE.\n\nOn 3 February 2016 Wigan was a guest on BBC Radio 4's \"Midweek\" programme.\n\nIn January 2018 Willard Wigan received an honorary doctorate from the University of Warwick in recognition of the significant contributions that he has made to art and sculpture.\n\nIn 2004, Wigan exhibited at The Artlounge gallery in Birmingham. The BBC's \"Inside Out - South West\" noted that the works displayed included \"scenes of Jesus Christ and The Last Supper, with each individual figure no bigger than an eyelash or a human hair. At less than a hundredth of an inch tall, it's painstakingly precise work\".\n\nIn 2009 Wigan appeared as a guest speaker at the TED Conference in Oxford, UK. and later that year also as a guest on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" in the US. On \"The Tonight Show\" he exhibited, with the aid of a microscope, two of his sculptures constructed within the eye of a needle – one of Buzz Aldrin in a spacesuit next to the American Flag and another of five characters from \"Star Wars\". Wigan explained that, while working on a grain of sand, he would sometimes use the tremor caused by his own heartbeat as a jack hammer to chisel the tiny particle.\n\nAfter a series of exhibitions in the UK, during 2009 and 2010 Wigan toured the US.\n\nWigan marked the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II by sculpting the Queen's portrait on a coffee bean; he described creating the work as \"a bit of a challenge because a coffee bean crumbles and is hollow in the middle\".\n\nThe Library of Birmingham exhibited his works in January 2015. In 2010, the BBC reported that Wigan had sculpted a model of St Bartholomew's church in Chosen Hill, Gloucestershire on a grain of sand that he had taken from its churchyard. He had done so in response to a challenge from his girlfriend, who described the result as \"absolutely fantastic\". The vicar of the church said the sculpture was beautiful, but Wigan expressed his own dissatisfaction with the work, saying \"As small as what you've seen, it's not the best of me yet, I'm taking it even smaller because I'm not satisfied with my work right now, it's too big.\"\n\n"}

It is located in the ancient city of Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is situated on the side of the holy river \"KShipra\". The presiding deity, Lord Shiva in the lingam form is believed to be \"Swayambhu\", deriving currents of power (Shakti) from within itself as against the other images and lingams that are ritually established and invested with mantra-shakti.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, A show premiered on History TV18 Mahakaleshwar : The Legends of Shiva showed about the working in Mahakaleshwar Mandir during the ShivaRatri.it is a famous temple in Ujjain\n\nAs per the Shiva Purana, Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu once had an argument over who was supreme in the creation. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as an endless pillar of light, the \"jyotirlinga\". Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma decide to travel along the pillar downwards and upwards respectively, to find the end of the light. Brahma lied that he had found the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The \"jyotirlinga\" is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The \"jyotirlinga\" shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. There are 64 forms of Shiva, not to be confused with Jyotirlingas. Each of the twelve \"jyotirlinga\" sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary image is \"lingam\" representing the beginningless and endless \"Stambha\" pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva. The twelve \"jyotirlinga\" are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas in Uttrakhand State, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deogarh in Jharkhand or at Baijnath in Himachal Pradesh, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.\n\nThe idol of Mahakaleshwar is known to be \"dakshinamukhi\", which means that it is facing the south. This is a unique feature, upheld by the \"tantric shivnetra\" tradition to be found only in Mahakaleshwar among the 12 Jyotirlingas. The idol of \"Omkareshwar Mahadev\" is consecrated in the sanctum above the Mahakal shrine. The images of Ganesh, Parvati and Karttikeya are installed in the west, north, and east of the sanctum sanctorum. To the south is the image of Nandi, the vehicle of Lord Shiva. The idol of Nagchandreshwar on the third storey is open for \"darshan\" only on the day of Nag Panchami. The temple has five levels, one of which is underground. The temple itself is located in a spacious courtyard surrounded by massive walls near a lake. The \"shikhar\" or the spire is adorned with sculptural finery. Brass lamps light the way to the underground sanctum. It is believed that \"prasada\" (holy offering) offered here to the deity can be re-offered unlike all other shrines.\n\nThe presiding deity of time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternally in the city of Ujjain. The temple of Mahakaleshwar, its \"shikhar\" soaring into the sky, an imposing façade against the skyline, evokes primordial awe and reverence with its majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and its people, even in the midst of the busy routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable link with ancient Hindu traditions.\n\nOn the day of Maha Shivaratri, a huge fair is held near the temple, and worship goes on through the night.\n\nDevotees are not allowed to bring bags , mobile phones and cameras during the visit . Lockers and Cloak Rooms are there for devotees where they can keep their belongings.\n\nIt is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Appar.\n\nThe shrine is revered as one of the 18 Maha Shakti Peetham.\n\nShakti Peethas are shrines that are believed to have enshrined with the presence of Shakti due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it. Each of the 51 \"Shakti Peethas\" has shrines for Shakti and Kalabhairava. The Upper Lip of Sati Devi is said to have fallen here and the Shakti is called as Mahakali.\n\nAccording to the Puranas, the city of Ujjain was called Avantika and was famous for its beauty and its status as a devotional epicenter. It was also one of the primary cities where students went to study holy scriptures. According to legend, there was a ruler of Ujjain called Chandrasena, who was a pious devotee of Lord Shiva and worshiped him all the time. One day, a farmer's boy named Shrikhar was walking on the grounds of the palace and heard the King chant the Lord's name and rushed to the temple to start praying with him. However, the guards removed him by force and sent him to the outskirts of the city near the river Kshipra. Rivals of Ujjain, primarily King Ripudamana and King Singhaditya of the neighboring kingdoms decided to attack the Kingdom and take over its treasures around this time. Hearing this, Shrikhar started to pray and the news spread to a priest named Vridhi. He was shocked to hear this and upon the urgent pleas of his sons, started to pray to Lord Shiva at the river Kshipra. The Kings chose to attack and were successful; with the help of the powerful demon Dushan, who was blessed by Lord Brahma to be invisible, they plundered the city and attacked all the devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nUpon hearing the pleas of His helpless devotees, Lord Shiva appeared in his Mahakala form and destroyed the enemies of King Chandrasena. Upon the request of his devotees Shrikhar and Vridhi, Lord Shiva agreed to reside in the city and become the chief deity of the Kingdom and take care of it against its enemies and to protect all His devotees. From that day on, Lord Shiva resided in His light form as Mahakala in a Lingam that was formed on its own from the powers of the Lord and His consort, Parvati. The Lord also blessed his devotees and declared that people who worshipped Him in this form would be free from the fear of death and diseases. Also, they would be granted worldly treasures and be under the protection of the Lord himself.\n\nBharthari was the elder son of King Gandharva-Sena, and received the kingdom of Ujjain from the celestial god Indra and the King of Dhara.\n\nWhen Bharthari was king of 'Ujjayani' (modern-day Ujjain) in his state there lived a Brahman who after years of austerities was given the fruit of immortality from the celestial tree of Kalpavriksha. The Brahman presented the same to his monarch, Raja Bharthari, who in turn, passed it on to his love, the beautiful, Pinglah Rani or Ananga Sena Raja Bhartrhari's last and youngest wife. The queen, being in love with the Head police officer of the state, Mahipaala, presented the fruit to him, who further passed it on to his beloved, Lakha, one of the maids of honour. Eventually, Lakha being in love with the king presented the fruit back to the king. Having completed the circle, the fruit revealed the downsides of infidelity to the king, he summoned the queen and ordered her beheading, and ate the fruit himself. After that, he abdicated the throne, and became a religious mendicant.\n\nHe later became a disciple of Pattinatthar who first indulged in an argument about \"samsari\" and \"sanyasi\" with king Bhartrhari. Later during the conversation \"pattinathar\" said that all women have 'dual mind' and it might be the true case even with Parameswari. King conveyed this news to Rani Pingalah and she ordered Pattinathar to get punished and to sit in \"kalu maram\" (tree, whose top portion would be sharpened like a pencil and whole tree is fully coated with oil, a person who is punished to sit in the top will be split into 2 pieces), they tried to kill Pattinathar, but Kalu Maram started burning and nothing happened to Pattinathar, the king came to know this news and went directly to Pattinathar and asked him to get ready to die the next day, but Pattinathar replied, \" I'm ready right now, to die\". The next day king came with tears in his eyes and released saint from jail because he actually noticed Queen Pingalah in love with horsemen that night, He threw away his empire, wealth, even full coat dress and dressed in a simple \"kovanam\" (loincloth), the king became a disciple of Pattinatthar and got \"mukthi\" (salvation) in Kalahasthi temple.\n\nKalidasa (c. 2nd–1st century BCE), the great Sanskrit poet of the times who was probably a contemporary of king Pushyamitra Sunga, has mentioned about the rituals of the temple in his works in \"Meghadūta\". He mentions about the \"nada-aradhana\", the performance of art and dance during the evening rituals.\n\nThe temple complex was destroyed by Sultan Shams-ud-din Iltutmish during his raid of Ujjain in 1234-5. The Jyotirlingam was dismantled and believed to be thrown into a nearby 'Kotiteerth Kunda' (a pond neighboring the temple) with the Jaladhari (a structure supporting the Lingam) stolen during the invasion.\n\nThe present structure was built by the Maratha general Ranoji Shinde in 1734 CE. Further developments and management was done by other members of his dynasty, including Mahadji Shinde (1730–12 February 1794) and Daulat Rao Shinde's wife Baiza Bai. (1827–1863). During the reign of Jayajirao Shinde (until 1886), major programs of the then Gwalior State used to be held at this temple.\n\nMaratha regime was established in Ujjain in the fourth decade of Eighteenth c. The administration of Ujjain was assigned by Peshwa Bajirao-I to his faithful commander Ranoji Shinde, The Diwan of Ranoji was Sukhatanakar Ramchandra Baba Shenavi who was very wealthy he decided to invest his wealth for religious purposes. In this connection, he re-built the famous Mahakala temple in Ujjain during the 4th-5th decades of Eighteenth c. AD.\nAfter Independence the Dev Sthan Trust was replaced by the municipal corporation of Ujjain. Nowadays it is under the collectorate office of Ujjain districrt.\n\n1. *Shreenath Madhavji: Mahayoddha Mahadji Ki Shourya Gatha* (History Research book in Hindi) Published in 2013 at Gwalior, Author Pandit Neelesh Ishwarchandra Karkare\n2. *Tawareekh-E-ShindeShahi* (History Research book in Hindi) Published in 2017 at Gwalior, Author Pandit Neelesh Ishwarchandra Karkare\n\n\n\nUjjain Temples\n"}

The first episode aired on September 19, 2003. The show was produced by the American arm of Endemol and Jeff Boggs served as executive producer. Six episodes were created. Episodes are available for purchase through digital video outlets and for free streaming on YouTube on the Endemol Beyond channel. In 2006, it was made available on the now-defunct In2TV web site run by AOL, on the Endemol USA channel.\n\nThe show was an American version of the British series \"The People's Book of Records\". It was similar to \"Banzai\" except that it did not emphasize wagering and instead of mocking Japanese culture, it parodied media coverage of major athletic events (especially British coverage). People competed in silly events to see who could become the People's Champion in that event (see the list of events below).\n\nEach episode opened with the show's host, Oliver Muirhead, introducing the staff of black with white-striped track-suit wearing judges, including an intense old man Ernie Misko, an intimidating large man of African descent, and a beautiful, sexy model Carolina Rommel. After an introduction by Muirhead, the event would start with a participant stating their desire to be the People's Champion of a certain event. Muirhead would then narrate the setup of the event and introduce the competition while the judges oversaw the competitions. Most events had three individual participants each making an attempt at the event. Events that involved all participants competing simultaneously often had more than three and some events featured a pair of two-person teams squaring off. While the events occur, Muirhead delivered exaggerated, sarcastic commentary. After some post-event interviews, the new People's Champion of the event was awarded. The last event of the show was a viewer-submitted challenge. Several amateur video clips for the contest were shown with the final one being the People's Champion. A recap of all of the day's Champions were shown during the credits at the end of the show.\n"}

{"id": "2175152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175152", "title": "Bouchout Castle", "text": "Bouchout Castle\n\nBouchout Castle () is a castle in the Flemish town of Meise, Belgium. In the 12th century, this territory of the young Duchy of Brabant was strategically positioned between the County of Flanders and the Berthout family, lords of Grimbergen. Most likely, the first fortification was built by Wouter van Craaynem at the end of the Grimbergen Wars (1150–1170). Bouchout Castle is situated at an altitude of 32 meters.\n\nAt about 1300, the Donjon tower of Bouchout Castle was erected by Daniel van Bouchout, a knight who fought gloriously at the Battle of Worringen. In the 15th and 16th century, Bouchout Castle was owned by the Van der Marck and Transylvan families. The castle fell into disrepair due to lack of maintenance, while the Spanish dominance and the iconoclastic fury further worsened its condition.\n\nThe first major renovation was performed by Christoffel d'Assonville at about 1600. The rectangular medieval Bouchout Castle was surrounded by a large pond and could only be reached by a long drawbridge. At the end of the 17th century, Peter-Ferdinand Roose transformed the castle into a Renaissance \"Chateau de Bouchout\", surrounded with French ornamental gardens. Unfortunately, the castle was partly destroyed during the French Revolution period (1800–1830). Again, the castle was restored in 1832 by count Amadeus de Beauffort, who gave Bouchout Castle its current Neo-Gothic appearance.\n\nFrom 1879 until 1927, Empress Charlotte of Mexico lived at the Bouchout Domain. Her husband Emperor Maximilian I was executed by Mexican republicans in 1867. Thereafter Charlotte led a secluded life at Bouchout Castle. Since 1939, the Bouchout Domain has developed into the National Botanic Garden of Belgium. Since the last renovation of 1987–1989, the castle and its rooms are now being used for meetings, lectures and exhibitions.\n\nDuring the first part of the 12th century, the territory of Bouchout (alternative spelling Boechout and pronounced as \"Book\"-\"Howt\"), played an important role in the foundation of the Duchy of Brabant. This Brabant territory was strategically positioned between the County of Flandres and the rebellious knights of Grimbergen. In the centre, the original territory was swampy and mainly consisted of beech trees. It was called \"Boc-holt\", which may point towards the origin of the castle's name, Boekhout.\n\nDuring this period, Godfrey I, Duke of Leuven settled peace with the Count of Flandres, so he could focus on establishing a stable Duchy. He experienced however that the Berthouts, lords of Grimbergen, were not loyal to him. The Berthout family owned a mighty castle at Grimbergen and thereby controlled the important trade routes from Bruges to Cologne (Germany). Despite a number attempts, Godfrey I and II did not succeed in defeating the Berthout family (Grimbergen Wars).\n\nGodfrey III decided to build two fortifications in the direct vicinity of Berthout Castle. The first one, Nedelaar Castle, was constructed in 1148 directly at the other side of river Zenne. The second one, at the Bouchout Domain, was constructed by Wouter van Craaynem (Kraainem, Crainhem) who received the domain from Godfrey III. At that same period, in 1159, the Brabant troops assisted by Flanders, defeated the Berthout family after twenty years of Grimbergen wars. The once so mighty Berthout Castle was burnt completely.\n\nIt is not completely clear how Bouchout Castle looked like in the second half of the 12th century. According to Cantillon the fortification was already a strong castle. However, Willem van Craaynem, who inherited the Bouchout domain from his father Wouter, only owned about 300 to 400 acres of land at about 1160–1170. As for many minor noblemen at that time, it is therefore also possible that \"Bouchout Castle\" was no more than a fortified house at the centre of the swampy Bouchout domain.\n\nIn spite of its French-like spelling, Bouchout, pronounced [buʃu] in French, is a Flemish name, which would be written Boekhout in modern script, and pronounced [bukhɔut]. It simply means \"beech\", boek or boekhout being a dialectal variant of the Dutch beuk. This toponym is frequent in the Dutch-speaking area.\n\nThe alternative etymology of boog-hout, meaning \"keep your bow tensed\", since the castle was positioned at a very strategic military location, is not substantiated.\n\nDaniel van Bouchout (Boechout and also Wanghe), the grandson of Willem van Craaynem, is one of the most famous members of the Bouchout family. He was the first one to use the name \"Van Bouchout\" and fought at the Battle of Worringen in 1288. It was Daniel who played a major role in capturing Reinoud van Gelre resulting in a glorious victory for duke Jan I van Brabant. Thereafter knight Daniel van Bouchout became one of the duke's advisors.\n\nSeveral sources, including Doperé and Ubregts, strongly suggest that it was knight Daniel who transformed the former fortified house into a mighty castle at about 1300. It included a large Donjon and five subsequent canals with an enormous drawbridge of in length. The Donjon tower is still preserved and is believed to be the oldest part of the current Bouchout Castle. This military Donjon has two levels and a platform. Each level has functional loopholes. The Neo-Gothic windows at level one most likely were made during the renovations of 1832, while the right-angled windows of level 2 are more original. The upper platform has battlements and merlons. At the court site, the coat of arms of the Bouchout family is visible (a red cross).\nA second historical member of this family was knight Jan van Bouchout (c. 1320–1391), grandson of Daniel. In 1355, Duchess Johanna succeeded her father, Duke Jan III of Brabant. This succession led to a war with Flanders, since its Lord – Louis II, Count of Flanders – was married with Margaret, the second daughter of Duke Jan III. The Brabant forces were beaten in 1356 at Scheut and most likely also Bouchout Castle was taken. After peace was restored, Jan became commander of Brussels. He fought against the Lord of Gerle at the battle of Baesweiler in 1371, but the Brabant troops were defeated. In 1386 however, he led a successful attack on the city of Grave at the river Meuse, thereby restoring his military distinction. Jan married Joanna van Hellebeke, but the couple did not get any heirs. It is known, however, that Jan was the father of a large number of natural descendants, who are known as \"the children of Bouchout\".\n\nAt the end of the 14th century, the Bouchout family extended their properties which included Blaasvelt, Humbeek, van Loenhout and Diepensteyn Castle. The direct family line became extinct however and the last representative, Margareta van Bouchout, married Everhard van der Marck in the middle of the 15th century. Thereafter, Bouchout Castle was owned by the Van der Marck family (1476–1537) and the Transylvan family (1537–1590). During this period Bouchout Castle fell into disrepair due to lack of maintenance. Moreover, the Spanish dominance of the Netherlands in the 16th century and the iconoclastic fury of 1566 further worsened its condition.\n\nThe illustration of Jan Baptist Gramaye in his work Gallo-Brabantia is the oldest known illustration and reveals Bouchout Castle in the first decade of the 17th century. It was Christoffel d'Assonville (1528–1606) who bought the castle in 1590 from Joanna Transylvan and restored \"Bocholdia Castrum\" into its glorious medieval state. Major restorations were carried out including the transformation of the five original canals into one surrounding pond. Note the very long drawbridge which is also described in the 14th century. It may however been drawn out of perspective, since the bridge appears to be about twice as long as the Donjon tower, which is about 20 meters high. The castle displays a rectangular structure with defensive towers at each corner including the Donjon which is still preserved today. The main building is at the back of the inner courtyard.\n\nD'Assonville was one of the most loyal ministers during the Spanish period and he is believed to have been part of the assault on the Prince Wiliam of Orange in 1584. In 1605, the Bouchout Domain was raised into a Barony enabling Christoffel d'Assonville to become a member of the Council of Brabant.\n\nIn 1626, Peter Verbist produced a detailed copper etching of the Duchy of Brabant. The Barony of Bouchout (\"Bochout\") can be found at a distance of about 7 miles to the north of Brussels (to the right at the map). This detailed map also displays Grimbergen (the former Berthout Castle) and Steinhussle, the territory of the related Diepensteyn Castle. The homeland of the founding fathers of Bouchout Castle is about 5 miles to the east of Brussels and includes the villages Crainhem, Sterbeeck and Nossegem.\n\nPeter-Ferdinand Roose was born in Antwerp. He was the son of Jan-Karel Roose († 1641), the mayor of the city of Antwerp and Anna Fredericks van Bouckhorst, lady of Séclin. After his parents died, Peter-Ferdinand became the foster son of his oncle Peter Roose who was an important advisor of Filips IV, King of Spain. In this period, the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands were at war with its suppressor Spain, which ended with a final separation at 1648 (Peace of Münster). During his career, Peter Roose had acquired a number of domains including Froidmont, Jemeppe, Han and Granvelle. Since he did not have any direct heirs, his family including his foster son Peter Ferdinand were well taken care of. Peter-Ferdinand became a lawyer and acquired Bouchout Castle in 1673 from Renom de France since he had many debts. In France, this was the period of the Renaissance during which Louis XIV of France created the Palace of Versailles.\n\nAlso Brussels developed into a fashionable capital where wigs and glamour for the happy few were common items. Peter-Ferdinand Roose transformed the medieval Castle into a Renaissance castle surrounded with French ornamental gardens. Most likely, Bouchout Castle was decorated with a wealth of paintings, classy furniture and closets full with books. You may notice that the drawbridge in the etching of Jacobus Harrewijn is more in proportion as compared to the drawing of Jan Baptist Gramaye (1606). In 1700, Peter-Ferdinand died without any heirs and he joined the ornamental family grave at the chapel of the St.Goedekerk (Brussels) besides his uncle Peter Roose.\n\nDuring the French Revolution and the subsequent domination of the Southern Netherlands (1797–1830), Bouchout Castle was partly destroyed. The wooden bridge was dismantled and used to warm the French soldiers during the severe winter of 1795, while that part of the pond was filled up to facilitate the entrance to the castle. Further, the complete enforcement at the front was destroyed and the castle was also looted by the soldiers. Clearly, Bouchout suffered a lot during the French dominance.\n\nSince 1830, Belgium is an independent country and during the early years, it was keen to prove its right to exist. The young nation therefore referred a lot to the late Middle Ages, during which the Southern Netherlands played an important role in the development of Europe. The early Neo-Gothic renovations of Bouchout Castle performed in 1832 by count Amedeus de Beauffort should be placed in the latter context. This count of Bouchout was born in Doornik in 1806 and studied law in Paris. He married Elisabeth Roose de Baisy in 1830 and became director of fine arts in 1835.\n\nUnder the supervision of architect Tilman François Suys, Bouchout Castle underwent a medieval metamorphosis. The Neo-Gothic renovations included, amongst others, demolishing the southern wing thereby rendering an open structure, modifying roof façades with gothic battlements, introducing neo-gothic windows, and adding further neo-gothic details to enhance the medieval charisma of the castle. Also illustrative for this period, were the curious objects and old paintings the noble families tend to collect. A fine example is the Armoury gallery (Salle d'armes) which was situated at the first floor of Bouchout Castle. In later years, the rooms adjacent to this gallery were removed and nowadays it is a conference room of 165 m². The renovated Bouchout Castle also harboured several Neo-Renaissance elements such as the fireplace at the dining room and the ceilings of the Empress Room and White Room. After the death of count Amedeus de Beauffort († 1858) and his wife countess Elisabeth Roose-de Baisy († 1873), their son Leopold became owner of Bouchout Castle. He did not marry and apparently lived in the Donjon tower.\n\nIn 1879, Bouchout Domain was bought by the Belgian court and served as residence for the King's sister, Charlotte, the dowager Empress of Mexico. She married Maximilian of Austria in 1857, who became emperor of Mexico in 1864. During this period, Mexico was occupied by France. However, after the Civil War in the United States had ended, the North Americans forced Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. This left Maximilian unprotected against the Mexican Republicans and, in spite of the many entreaties of his wife, he decided to stay. He was captured and executed in 1867. \n\nCharlotte suffered a lot during this period, after which her mental condition was described as very weak. The Empress with her court was based in the castle, but she never took public engagements. Since Charlotte was the sister-in-law of Franz Joseph I of Austria, the domain was respected during World War I by the occupying German soldiers. This allowed the citizens of Meise to use the castle's domain as a place of refuge.\nThe empress-dowager died in the castle on 19 January 1927.\n\nAfter Empress Charlotte died in 1927, most of the furnishings were transferred to the Royal Belgium Palace at Laken. Fortunately, the domain which included Bouchout Castle and Meise Castle was bought by the Belgian State. Thereafter, part of the domain was developed into a Botanical garden which became public in 1958. In 1939, Belgian soldiers were billeted at Bouchout Castle, who looted it in November 1939. During World War II, Bouchout Castle was occupied by German soldiers, who also built four fortified shelters at the domain. In November 1944, a first flying bomb struck the west side of the Domain, causing most windows of Bouchout Castle to break. A second flying bomb struck Meise Castle, which burnt completely.\n\nThe condition of Bouchout Castle worsened again during the decades after World War II. In the 1960s plans were made for the restoration of the castle. The castle was finally restored between 1987 and 1989. Since then it has served as a place for meetings, lectures and exhibitions, surrounded by the 92 hectares of the National Botanical Garden of Belgium.\n\nBouchout Castle (nr. 3 at the map to the left) is somewhat below the centre of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium and can be easily reached from the main entrance. To the south of the castle, the Garden Shop (number 4) at the Tenant Farm displays a large number of botanical items and books related to the garden. Further to the south-east, a large complex of greenhouses (number 5) enables the visitors to travel through various climates such as the rainforest, the mediterranean and drought-monsoon greenhouses. The large western part of Bouchout Domain includes a field of large oaks (number 20), beehouses (number 38), wild roses (number 36) and maple trees (number 23). To the east of Bouchout Castle, the former Orangery (number 10) harbours a place to relax, drink and eat.\n\nAt 17 June 2010, Bouchout Castle hosted the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Jan-Peter Balkenende gave a farewell party for his European friends, including Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2175167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175167", "title": "Matthew 5", "text": "Matthew 5\n\nMatthew 5 is the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. It contains the first portion of the Sermon on the Mount, which will also take up chapters 6 and 7. Portions are similar to the Sermon on the Plain in Luke 6, but much of the material is found only in Matthew. It is one of the most discussed and analyzed chapters of the New Testament. Warren Kissinger reports that among Early Christians no chapter was more often cited by early scholars. The same is true in modern scholarship.\n\nIn the Middle Ages an interpretation was developed that the chapter only applied to a select group, and not to the general populace. Reformer Martin Luther, in a discussion of this chapter, was highly critical of the Catholic view. He wrote that \"there have fallen upon this [fifth] chapter the vulgar hogs and asses, jurists and sophists, the right hand of the pope and his Mamelukes.\"\n\nIn John Wesley's analysis of the Sermon on the Mount, chapter five outlines \"the sum of all true religion\", allowing chapter 6 to detail \"rules for that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward actions, unmixed with worldly desires or anxious cares for even the necessaries of life\" and chapter 7 to provide \"cautions against the main hinderances of religion\".\n\nThe source of Matthew 5 is uncertain. It contains only a handful of parallels with Mark, but does have a number of loose parallels with Luke's Sermon on the Plain. For those who believe in the two-source hypothesis, it indicates that much of this text likely came from Q. However, Harvey King McArthur notes that the parallels in Luke tend to be very loose, far further away than most areas they overlap. There are also a considerable number of verses that have no parallel in Luke. McArthur thus theorizes that there was an extra step between the sources Matthew and Luke used than usual.\n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 48 verses.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n\nThe New King James Version organises this chapter as follows:\n\nAfter a brief introduction (–) the chapter contains the section known as the Beatitudes, which includes some of Jesus' most famous teachings. Theologian Robert H. Gundry suggests the Beatitudes can be divided into two quartets. The first group outlines the persecuted nature of Jesus' disciples, and the rewards they will receive for enduring this condition. The second four list the righteous behaviour which can led to such persecution. Most scholars feel the ninth Beatitude at is separate from the first eight, as demonstrated by its shift to the second person. Four of the Beatitudes seem to be also in Luke, the rest are only found in Matthew.\n\nThe English word used to show the positive nature of the Beatitudes is \"blessed\". A number of scholars note that this is not an ideal translation as in modern English, \"blessed\" often means \"blessed by God\", a meaning not implied by the Greek. William F. Albright and C. S. Mann use the more general word \"fortunate\" instead of \"blessed\". R. T. France feels that it should be read as \"worthy of congratulation\". Lapide supports the New American Bible usage of \"happy\"; it directly translates the word \"beatus\" in the Vulgate, and it carries the meaning of the Greek. After the Beatitudes there are a series of metaphors, called Salt and Light, that are often seen as commentaries upon them. These include a number of famous phrases such as salt of the earth and city on a hill.\n\n\nThe NIV translation entitles \"The Fulfillment of the Law\", the NRSV translation entitles it \"The Law and the Prophets\", the United Bible Societies' \"The Greek New Testament\", edited by Kurt Aland, Bruce Metzger and others, entitles it the \"Teaching about the Law.\"\n\nThis pericope is at the core of the argument about the relationship between the views attributed to Jesus, such as Gospel, Grace, New Covenant, New Commandment, Law of Christ, and those attributed to Moses or the Mosaic Law, and hence on the relationship between the New Testament and Old Testament, Christian views on the old covenant, Law and Gospel, and as a basis of Christian ethics.\n\nThe reason for this argument is a disagreement about the proper interpretation of the word \"fulfillment\" (πληρῶσαι; plerosai). This goes back at least as far as Marcion of Sinope and continues until today. Many modern scholars now consider these four verses to be a prelude to the Antitheses, but this position is not universally accepted, and many continue to interpret Matthew 5:17–20 independent of its textual neighbors.\n\nThe sermon then moves to a highly structured discussion (\"Ye have heard… But I say unto you\") of the \"Law and Prophets\" or Old Covenant. This section ( to ) is traditionally referred to as \"the Antitheses\", or the \"Six Antitheses\".\n\nGundry disputes this title: \"The sayings are traditionally called 'the Antitheses'. But this designation seems to imply that after stoutly affirming the Law in , Jesus contradicts it\". Instead Gundry argues that Jesus escalates the Law towards \"the goal toward which it was already headed, so that we should stop calling these sayings \"the Antitheses\" and perhaps start calling them \"the Culminations\".\n\nAfter the introduction (–), the next verses are commentaries on six specific topics where Jesus recites a law, starting with two of the Ten Commandments, and then comments on it. This generally sees Jesus impose more rigorous standards. The six antitheses are on: \nThe Jewish Encyclopedia states:\nJesus' six antitheses are on six topics. In each of them, Jesus opens the statement with words to the effect: \"You have heard it said… but I say to you…\" These antitheses only appear in Matthew. At the outset, Jesus made it clear that he greatly respects Old Testament Law in the Torah, and fulfilling the Law was one of his purposes for coming to Earth.\n\nDaniel J. Harrington believes that the community for which Matthew wrote primarily but not exclusively were Jewish Christians. If so, that may explain why Matthew could use Jewish rhetoric and themes without explanation. Harrington says that is not the case for 21st-century Americans and others who read the Gospel today. In the six antitheses Jesus either extends through the Commandment's scope by going to the root of the abuse (avoiding anger and lust to prevent murder and adultery) or going beyond a biblical commandment as in the case of divorce and oaths. Harrington writes that Matthew presents the six antitheses as examples of the principle that Jesus came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law and the Prophets.\n\nThe first antithesis (verses 21–22) attacks anger as the root of murder. The two loosely connected illustrations (23–24, 25–26) point out the value of reconciling with one's enemy.\nThe second antithesis (verses 27–28) attacks lust as the root of adultery. The sayings about the right eye and the right-hand as causes of scandal (29–30) are further instances of going to the sources of sin.\nThe third antithesis (verses 31–32) explains Jesus' prohibition of divorce as a way of avoiding the divorce procedure outlined in .\n\nThe fourth antithesis (verses 33–37) about oaths says to avoid oaths entirely so as never to swear falsely.\nThe fifth antithesis on non-retaliation (verses 38–39a) also urges the followers of Jesus to not seek revenge through violence. The examples not only prohibit violence, but also require that brutality and force be met with goodness.\n\nThe final antithesis (verses 43–48) defines \"neighbor\". Here Jesus urges that love include even enemies instead of restricting love only to those who either can benefit us or who already love us.\nThe chapter ends with an exhortation to perfection, the , \"teleios\", meaning also \"full grown\" or \"of full maturity\".\n\nIn the King James Version chapter five reads:\n<poem>¹And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: ²And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,\n³Blessed \"are\" the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n⁴Blessed \"are\" they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n⁵Blessed \"are\" the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n⁶Blessed \"are\" they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n⁷Blessed \"are\" the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n⁸Blessed \"are\" the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n⁹Blessed \"are\" the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n¹⁰ Blessed \"are\" they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n¹¹Blessed are ye, when \"men\" shall revile you, and persecute \"you\", and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. ¹²Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great \"is\" your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\n¹³Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\n¹⁴Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. ¹⁵Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. ¹⁶Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\n¹⁷Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. ¹⁸For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. ¹⁹Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach \"them\", the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ²⁰For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed \"the righteousness\" of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n²¹Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: ²²But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. ²³Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; ²⁴Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. ²⁵Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. ²⁶Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\n²⁷Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: ²⁸But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. ²⁹And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast \"it\" from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \"that\" thy whole body should be cast into hell. ³⁰And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast \"it\" from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \"that\" thy whole body should be cast into hell.\n³¹It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: ³²But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\n³³Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: ³⁴But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: ³⁵Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. ³⁶Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. ³⁷But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\n³⁸Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: ³⁹But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. ⁴⁰And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have \"thy\" cloke also. ⁴¹And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. ⁴²Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.\n⁴³Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. ⁴⁴But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; ⁴⁵That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. ⁴⁶For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? ⁴⁷And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more \"than others\"? do not even the publicans so? ⁴⁸Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</poem>\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on 27 September 1982 through record label Kamera.\n\n\"Room to Live\" was recorded as a quick followup to \"Hex Enduction Hour\", which had been released in March of the same year. It was to be Marc Riley's last album with the group.\n\nThe group had originally entered the studio to record a single, but Mark E. Smith prevailed upon them to record more songs, all of which were new to the band and had not previously been rehearsed or performed live. In accordance with this experimental approach, members were deliberately excluded from certain tracks. Smith also stated of the songs that \"some of them are just me and Karl double-tracked\" Whilst these remarks resulted in considerable conjecture among fans, the exact lineups for each track have never been properly confirmed. In a letter to \"City Life\" magazine in April 1984, Smith noted that Riley only played on two tracks on \"Room to Live\", and in 2008 Riley confirmed via his BBC6 radio show that he did not appear on all tracks. In his book \"The Big Midweek\", Steve Hanley states that \"Marquis Cha-Cha\" was recorded by a trio of himself, Burns and Smith and also confirms the role of Arthur Kadmon (from Ludus and credited as \"Cadman\") in the recording of \"Hard Life in Country\" at a session to which neither Craig Scanlon nor Marc Riley were invited. Hanley's version, however, appears to refute the much-rumoured story, as relayed by Mick Middles in his book \"The Fall\" (co-authored with Mark E Smith), that suggested that Kadmon recorded approximately sixteen seconds of guitar and was then dismissed. Drummer Paul Hanley described the recording of the album as \"a fucking nightmare. You'd turn up and find Smith had only invited half the band, or brought in other musicians without telling anyone!\".\n\nThe album was recorded at Cargo Studios in Rochdale over a two week period prior to the group's tour of Australia and New Zealand in July and August 1982, and thus songs from the record feature heavily on the live album \"Fall in a Hole\".\n\n\"Room to Live\" has been described as the band's most overtly topical album. Smith described it as \"me going off on a tangent...most of the songs are about Britain as I see it on a wider scale, having been abroad a lot.\" \"Papal Visit\" was about the first visit of a Pope to Britain in 450 years, a song Smith described as 'anti-Pope'. \"Marquis Cha-Cha\" concerned the Falklands War, the titular character described as \"a Falklands-flavoured equivalent to the English-born Nazi propagandist Lord Haw Haw\".\n\nThe album was described as \"slapped together and half-baked\" and \"rough around the edges\" compared to \"Hex Enduction Hour\", although this was considered by writer Dave Thompson (who described it as \"the sound of the band at its most spontaneous, the sound of Smith at his most inchoate\") to be intentional, and Smith himself stated \"I wanted to do something spontaneous...to get back to the old Fall way of recording songs straight off the top of our heads\". \n\n\"Sounds\" reviewer Dave McCullough gave it two stars, stating that it \"lacks bounce and zap\" and \"musically, the Fall really are a mess\". The \"NME\"s Amrik Rai called it \"frustratingly sketchy\" and stating that it \"sounds as if they've written, recorded and pressed it and still got back in time for last orders\", going on to sum it up as \"right crap\". \n\n\"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\" stated that the album \"sports fabulously irritated lyrics aimed squarely at bourgeois Britain, undercut by thinner, less compelling music, and an uninterested-sounding Smith.\" It was also described as \"a more self-indulgent delivery\" than its predecessor. \"Trouser Press\" commented on \"a sparser, less rhythmic sound than \"Hex Enduction Hour\"\", going on to say \"Smith is in top lyrical form, with pungent, satirical views of British life: 'Marquis Cha Cha' offers biting commentary on the Falklands War.\" AllMusic's Dean McFarlane described it as \"possibly the most archly political and scathing collection of diatribes the Manchester legend spewed forth onto record during what is arguably the group's creative peak\" and \"one of the greatest pieces of post-punk genius the group ever recorded\". Robert Ham, writing for Stereogum was less enthusiastic, stating \"Were it not for the seamy bass-and-scratching guitar minimalism of 'Detective Instinct' and the jaunty 'Solicitor in Studio', this would be a complete throwaway.\"\n\n\"Room to Live\" peaked at number 4 in the UK Independent Albums Chart, spending ten weeks on the chart in total.\n\nThe 1983 German pressing of the album added the 1981 single \"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\" and its B-side, \"Fantastic Life\", to the end of side B. This inclusion was repeated on the first UK CD edition of the album issued via Cog Sinister in 1998 (mastered from a particularly noisy German vinyl copy) but was removed on the 2005 remaster (from the superior original Kamera vinyl), since the two tracks had since been included in the \"Slates\" reissue. Other contemporaneous bonus material was added in its place. The album was reissued on vinyl in 2016 with its original track listing on the Superior Viaduct label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2175187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175187", "title": "Chinese armour", "text": "Chinese armour\n\nChinese armour was predominantly lamellar from the Warring States period (481 BC - 221 BC) onward, prior to which animal parts such as rhinoceros hide, rawhide, and turtle shells were used for protection. Lamellar armour was supplemented by scale armour since the Warring States period or earlier. Partial plate armour was popular from the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), and mail and mountain pattern armour from the Tang dynasty (618–907). mail had been known since the Han Dynasty, but did not see widespread production or battlefield use, and may have seen as \"exotic foreign armor\" used as a display of wealth for wealthier officers and soldiers. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), brigandine began to supplant lamellar armour and was used to a great degree into the Qing dynasty (1644–1912.). By the 19th century most Qing armour, which was of the brigandine type, were purely ceremonial, having kept the outer studs for aesthetic purposes, and omitted the protective metal plates.\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence of armour in China dates to the Shang dynasty. These were either breastplates made of shell tied together or a one-piece leather breastplate. Helmets were made of bronze and often sported elaborate designs consisting of animal motifs. Armour was exclusively for nobles; regular folks had no protection except for a leather covered bamboo shield.\n\nArmour in the Zhou dynasty consisted of either a sleeveless coat of rhinoceros or buffalo hide, or leather scale armour. Helmets were largely similar to Shang predecessors but less ornate. Chariot horses were sometimes protected by tiger skins.\n\nIn the 4th century BC, rhinoceros armour was still used. In the following passage Guan Zhong advises Duke Huan of Qi to convert punishments to armour and weapons:\n\nLamellar armour of leather, bronze and iron appeared by the mid-4th century BC. It consisted of individual armour pieces (lamellae, lamella singular) that were either riveted or laced together to form a suit of armour. Iron helmets constructed with multiple lamellae began to replace the one piece bronze helmets of old. One sample discovered in Yi county, Hebei Province was composed of 89 lamellae, averaging 5cm x 4cm.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, both iron weapons and armour became more common. According to the \"Xunzi\", \"the hard iron spears of Wan (宛) [a city in Chu, near modern Nanyang (南陽), Henan] are as cruel as wasps and scorpions.\" Iron weapons also gave Chinese armies an edge over barbarians. Han Fei recounts that during a battle with the Gonggong (共工) tribe, \"the iron-tipped lances reached the enemy, and those without strong helmets and armour were injured.\" The effectiveness of bronze axes and shields may have been superseded by new iron weaponry and armor. The efficiency of crossbows however outpaced any progress in defensive armour. It was considered a common occurrence in ancient China for commoners or peasants to kill a lord with a well aimed crossbow bolt, regardless of whatever armour he might have been wearing at the time.\n\nArmour was mostly restricted to elite guard units and each state distributed armour in their own ways. The state of Chu favoured elite armoured crossbow units known for their endurance, and were capable of marching 160km 'without resting.' Wei's elite forces were capable of marching over 40km in one day while wearing heavy armour, a large crossbow with 50 bolts, a helmet, a side sword, and three days worth of rations. Those who met these standards earned an exemption from corvée labor and taxes for their entire family. \n\nAccording to Su Qin, the state of Han made the best weapons, capable of cleaving through the strongest armour, shields, leather boots and helmets. Their soldiers wore iron facemasks. \n\nBy the end of the 3rd century BC at least a few horsemen wore armour of some kind. \n\nThe Qin calculated fines for more severe crimes in terms of one or two coats of armour, lower crimes in terms of shields, and the lowest in terms of coins. Qin soldiers sometimes threw off their armour in a kind of berserk rage and engaged in fanatical charges. Qin armour usually used rectangular lamellae with dimensions of 7.5cm x 8.5cm and 10.5cm x 7.8cm. Dimensions of lamellae used for charioteer armour varies between the upper body, lower body, and arms. Lamellae on the upper body were 7cm x 6cm, the lower body 9cm x 6.5cm, and arms 4-7.5cm x 4cm. Lamellae on cavalrymen were 8cm x 5.7cm. A complete set of Qin armour, judging by the finds in the Terracotta Army consisted of 250 to 612 pieces in total, not including the helmet.\n\nSix groups of armour have been identified in the Terracotta Army corresponding to rank and military division. Ordinary soldiers are outfitted with no armour at all, cavalrymen with armour that covered the chest, armed infantry with armour covering the torso and shoulders, low-ranking officers with armour using large lamellae, middle-ranking officers with shorter armour covering the torso and waist or just the breast, but with decorations such as ribbons, and generals with a distinctive coat showing torso armour and ribbons to signify their status. None of the terracotta soldiers have been found wearing a helmet or holding a shield. The generals wear a pheasant-tail headdress while middle ranking officers wear a long flat cap. Both armed infantry and cavalrymen have soft caps, but while the infantry cap accommodates the top knot, the cap for cavalrymen is flat and tied below the chin.\n\nThere is some evidence that armour for horses might have existed for Qin cavalry judging by 300 lamellae too large for human use.\n\nHan dynasty armour was largely the same as the Qin dynasty with minor variations. Infantry wore suits of lacquered rawhide, hardened and lacquered leather [or partially tanned rawhide?], or iron [or iron alloys such as steel] lamellar armour and caps or iron helmets. A suit of iron armour dating to the Western Han period consisted of 328 lamellae pieces. Some riders wore armour and carried shields and some horses were armored. However, more widespread and more comprehensive horse armour is not attested to until the late 2nd century. \n\nDuring the late 2nd century BC, the government created a monopoly on the ironworks, which may have caused a decrease in quality of iron and armour. Bu Shi claimed that the resulting products were inferior because they were made to meet quotas rather than for practical use. These monopolies as debated in the Discourses on Salt and Iron were abolished by the beginning of the 1st century AD. In 150 AD, Cui Shi made similar complaints about the issue of quality control in government production due to corruption: \"...not long thereafter the overseers stopped being attentive, and the wrong men have been promoted by Imperial decree. Greedy officers fight over the materials, and shifty craftsmen cheat them... Iron [i.e. steel] is quenched in vinegar, making it brittle and easy to... [?] The suits of armour are too small and do not fit properly.\"\n\nComposite bows were considered effective against unarmoured enemies at 165 yards, and against armoured opponents at 65 yards.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, a hook shield was used in combination with a sword when fighting against polearms. The hook shield was a small iron shield that had hooks at the top and bottom for hooking halberds or spears. Sometimes it had a thorny protrusion in the middle for attacking.\n\nBy the Three Kingdoms period many cavalrymen wore armour and some horses were equipped with their own armour as well. In one battle, the warlord Cao Cao boasted that with only ten sets of horse armour he had faced an enemy with three hundred sets. The horse armour may however have just been metal partial frontal barding or a mixture of metal and rawhide barding rather than fully comprehensive all metal barding.\n\nReferences to \"great shields\" occur in their usage on the front line to protect spearmen and crossbowmen. Shields were also commonly paired with the single edged dao and used among cavalrymen. Descriptions of the Battle of Guandu mention that Cao Cao's soldiers employed shield cover above their heads each time they moved out into the open due to oppressive arrow fire from Yuan Shao's wooden towers.\n\nA report in 231 AD mentions the capture of 5,000 suits of \"dark armour\" (\"xuan kai\" or \"xuan jia\" 玄鎧/玄甲) and 3,100 crossbows. Dark armour appears in Han texts as well, but only as the attire worn by honor guards at funeral processions. The only trait known about dark armour is that it reflected the sun's rays. This probably means dark armour was made of high quality steel, which was often associated with black ferrous material.\n\nCao Zhi mentioned three different kinds of armour, two of which were variants of \"brilliant\" armour:\n\nBrilliant armour was made of decarburized steel, which shines blue-black when polished, giving it its name. Chen Lin described brilliant armour in the following manner:\n\nFully comprehensive metal horse armour covering the horse's entire body appeared in northeastern China in the mid-4th century during the Eastern Jin dynasty, probably as a result of Xianbei influence. By the end of the 4th century, murals depicting horse armour covering the entire body were found in tombs as far as Yunnan.\n\nSources mention the capture of thousands of \"armored horses\" in a single battle.\n\nShi Hu's bodyguard was said to have worn \"fine five-colored armour\" (\"wuse xikai\"), which was so dazzling it blinded the eye. This was probably similar in construction to brilliant armour.\n\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420-589), a style of armour called \"cord and plaque\" became popular, as did shields and long swords. \"Cord and plaque\" armour consisted of double breast plates in the front and back held together, sometimes on a frame, by two shoulder straps and waist cords, worn over the usual lamellar armour. \"Cord and plaque\" wearing figurines are also often depicted holding an oval or rectangular shield and a long sword. Types of armour had also apparently become distinct enough for there to be separate categories for light and heavy armour.\n\nBright brilliant armour continued to be prominent. In 518 AD, the Northern Wei court gave a visiting Avar chieftain a set of fine bright brilliant cavalry armour and six sets of iron cavalry armour. Deployment of armoured cavalry was common for the Northern Wei, especially among the \"iron-clad\" Erzhu tribe who specialized in armoured cavalry. References to heavy cavalry as \"iron horses\" occur in the poetry of Lu Chui. In 543 AD, the Western Wei general Cai Yu came to be known as \"iron tiger\" for his distinctive bright brilliant armour.\n\nDepictions of \"banded\" armour have been found in Northern and Southern dynasties and Tang era art. This type of armour was built up of long horizontal bands or plates, similar to the lorica segmentata. The imperial guards of the Jurchen Jin dynasty have been described wearing banded armour. The left guards wore blue banded armour and held yellow dragon flags while the right guards wore red banded armour and held red dragon flags. Banded armour is even more rarely depicted than the elusive mountain pattern armour or mail armour.\n\nIn the 6th century, Qimu Huaiwen introduced to Northern Qi the process of 'co-fusion' steel-making, which used metals of different carbon contents to create steel. Apparently sabers made using this method were capable of penetrating 30 armour lamellae. It's not clear if the armour was of iron or leather.\n\nThe Sui dynasty made prodigious use of heavy cavalry. Both men and horses were heavily armoured.\n\nThe \"History of Sui\" provides an account of the \"first cavalry battalions\" of the dynasty's 24 armies. They wore \"bright-brilliant\" (\"mingguang\") armour made of decarburized steel connected by dark green cords, their horses wore iron armour with dark green tassels, and they were distinguished by lion banners. Other battalions were also distinguished by their own colors, patterns, and flags, but neither the bright-brilliant armour or iron armour are mentioned.\n\nBy the Tang dynasty it was possible for armour to provide immense personal protection. In one instance Li Shimin's cousin, Li Daoxuan, was able to cut his way through the entire enemy mass of Xia soldiers and then cut his way back again, repeating the operation several times before the battle was won, at which point he had so many arrows sticking out of his armour that he looked like a \"porcupine.\" The effective range of a composite bow against armoured troops in this era was considered to be around 75 to 100 yards.\n\nInfantry armour became more common in the Tang era and roughly 60 percent of active soldiers were equipped with armour of some kind. Armour could be manufactured natively or captured as a result of war. For instance 10,000 suits of iron armour were captured during the Goguryeo–Tang War. Armour and mounts, including pack animals, were supplied by the state through state funds, and thus considered state property. Private ownership of military equipment such as horse armour, long lances, and crossbows was prohibited. Possession was taken as intent of rebellion or treason. The army staff kept track of armour and weapons with detailed records of items issued. If a deficiency was discovered, the corresponding soldier was ordered to pay restitution. The state also provided clothing and rations for border garrisons and expeditionary armies. Soldiers not on active duty were expected to pay for themselves, although \"professional\" soldiers were given tax exemptions.\n\nLi Shimin's elite cavalry forces were known to have worn distinctive black \"iron clad\" armour, but heavy cavalry declined as Turkic influence became more prevalent and light cavalry became the dominant mode of mounted warfare. Tang expeditionary forces to Central Asia preferred a mixture of light and heavy Chinese horse archers. After the An Lushan rebellion of the mid-9th century and losing the northwestern pastures to the Tibetans, Chinese cavalry almost disappeared altogether as a relevant military force. Many southern horses were considered too small or frail to carry an armoured soldier.\n\nTang iron lamellae were between 9.6 to 9 cm long, 2.6 to 1.3 cm wide, and 0.28 to 0.22 cm thick.\n\nMail was already known to the Chinese since they first encountered it in 384 AD when their allies in the nation of Kuchi arrived wearing \"armor similar to chains\". However mail armour was not mentioned again until 718 AD when a tributary mission from Samarkand presented to the Tang emperor a coat of \"link armour\". Mail was later improved on during the Song dynasty to withstand arrows better, by which H. Russell Robinson believes meant using interlocked rings. However mail was never used in any significant numbers and was seen as a valuable status symbol, so it typically belonged to the affluent and rich who could afford it. The dominant form of armour continued to be lamellar.\n\nReferences to mountain pattern armour () appear as early as the Tang dynasty in the \"Six Statutels of the Tang Dynasty\", but historical texts provide no explanation or diagram of how it actually worked. There are also no surviving examples of it. Everything that is known about mountain pattern armour comes from paintings and statues, typically of the Song and Ming periods. It is not unique to China and has been found in depictions in Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and even Thailand, however non-religious depictions are limited to only China, Korea, and Vietnam. Reconstruction projects of this type of armour have largely failed to produce good results.\n\nThe current theory is that this type of armour is made from a multitude of small pieces of iron or steel shaped like the Chinese character for the word \"mountain\" (山). The pieces are interlocked and riveted to a cloth or leather backing. It covers the torso, shoulders and thighs while remaining comfortable and flexible enough to allow movement. Also during this time, senior Chinese officers used mirror armour () to protect important body parts, while cloth, leather, lamellar, and/or Mountain pattern armor were used for other body parts. This overall design was called \"shining armor\" ().\n\nThere is an alternative theory that mountain pattern armour is simply a result of very stylistic depictions of mail armour, but known depictions of mail armour in Chinese art do not match with mountain pattern armour either. \n\nDuring the wars between the Later Zhou and Southern Tang, civilians on the Tang side formed \"White Armor Armies\", named after the white paper armour they wore. These Tang civilian armies experienced some success in driving off small contingents of Zhou forces but avoided confrontation with the larger army. The White Armour militia army was later revived to fight against the Song dynasty, but they were ineffective and disbanded.\n\nLater Ming texts provide descriptions of paper armour. One version was made of silk paper and functioned as a gambeson, worn under other armour or by itself. Silk paper could also be used for arm guards. Another version used thicker, more flexible paper, hammered soft, and fastened with studs. It's said that this type of paper armour performed better when soaked with water.\n\nPaper armour was still worn by the Hui people in Yunnan in the late 19th century. Bark paper armour in layers of thirty to sixty sheets in addition to silk and cotton was considered to be fairly good protection against musket balls and bayonets, which got stuck in the layers of paper, but not breech loading rifles at close quarters.\n\nThe Khitans of the Liao dynasty employed heavy armoured cavalry as the core of their army. In battle they arrayed light cavalry in the front and two layers of armoured cavalry in the back. Even foragers were armoured. Units of Khitan heavy cavalry were organized in groups of 500 to 700 men. Unlike some other empires originating from nomadic tribes, the Khitans preferred to fight in dense heavy cavalry formations rather than the wide formations of horse archers.\n\nDuring the Song dynasty (960–1279) it became fashionable to create warts on pieces of armour to imitate cold forged steel, a product typically produced by non-Han people in modern Qinghai. Warts created from cold work were actually spots of higher carbon in the original steel, thus aesthetic warts on non-cold forged steel served no purpose. According to Shen Kuo, armour constructed of cold forged steel was impenetrable to arrows shot at a distance of 50 paces. Even if the arrow happened to hit a drill hole, the arrowhead was the one which was ruined. However crossbows were still prized for their ability to penetrate heavy armour.\n\nThe \"History of Song\" notes that Song \"tools of war were exceedingly effective, never before seen in recent times,\" and \"their weapons and armor were very good\", but \"their troops weren't always effective.\"\n\nThe Western Xia made modest use of heavy cavalry, of which it had 3,000 at its height.\n\nThe Jurchens had a reputation for making high quality armour and weapons. Both metal and quilted armour were worn by Jurchens. The Jurchen army was organized into units of a thousand and a hundred. Every hundred was composed of two fifty men social and economic units called \"punian\". Each punian was supposed to have 20 men equipped with armour and lances or halberds. These 20 men formed a standard two rank five deep battle formation while the others formed three ranks of archers.\n\nIn 1232 the Jurchens used cast iron bombs against the Mongols at the siege of Kaifeng. The \"History of Jin\" states that the fire created by the blast could penetrate even iron armour.\n\nAccording to Meng Hong, the reason for the Mongols' success was that they possessed more iron than previous steppe peoples.\n\nBoth Chinese and European sources concur that Mongols wore substantial armour capable of stopping arrows. A Song source notes that one way to pierce heavily clad Mongol warriors was to use small arrows capable of entering the eye slits of their helmet. According to Thomas the Archdeacon, Mongol arrows were capable of penetrating all known types of armour at the time, but their own leather armour could withstand the arrows of their enemies. However he also mentions that the Mongols feared crossbows.\n\nGiovanni da Pian del Carpine describing Mongol lamellar armour:\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, most soldiers did not wear armour, which was reserved for officers and a small portion of the several hundred thousand strong army. Horse armour was only used for a small portion of cavalry, which was itself a minute portion of the Ming army. \n\nAlthough armour never lost all meaning during the Ming dynasty, it became less and less important as the power of firearms became apparent. It was already acknowledged by the early Ming artillery officer Jiao Yu that guns \"were found to behave like flying dragons, able to penetrate layers of armor.\" Fully armoured soldiers could and were killed by guns. The Ming Marshall Cai was one such victim. An account from the enemy side states, \"Our troops used fire tubes to shoot and fell him, and the great army quickly lifted him and carried him back to his fortifications.\" It is possible that Chinese armour had some success in blocking musket balls later on during the Ming dynasty. According to the Japanese, during the Battle of Jiksan, the Chinese wore armour and used shields that were at least partially bulletproof. Frederick Coyett later described Ming lamellar armour as providing complete protection from \"small arms\", although this is sometimes mistranslated as \"rifle bullets\". \n\nRocket handlers often wore heavy armour for extra protection so that they could fire at close range.\n\nBrigandine armour (\"dingjia\" (Chinese: 釘甲; Pinyin: Dīng jiǎ)) was introduced during the Ming era and consisted of riveted plates covered with fabric.\n\nPartial plate armour in the form of a cuirass sewn together with fabric is mentioned in the \"Wubei Yaolue\", 1638. It's not known how common plate armour was during the Ming dynasty, and no other source mentions it.\n\nIn the 17th century the Qing army was equipped with both lamellar and brigandine armour. After the conquest of China and peace was established in the majority of the empire, many soldiers became lazy and refused to wear armour. In the 18th century, the Qianlong Emperor said, \"Our old Manchu customs respect righteousness and revere justice. Young and old, none are ashamed to fight for them. But after enjoying such a long period of peace, inevitably, people want to avoid putting on armor and joining the ranks of war.\"\n\nEnglish literature in the early 19th century mentions Chinese rattan shields that were \"almost musket proof\", however another English source in the late 19th century states that they did nothing to protect their users during an advance on a Muslim stronghold, in which they were all invariably shot to death. \n\nBy the 19th century most Qing armour were purely for show. They kept the outer studs of brigandine armour for aesthetic purposes but omitted the protective iron plates. According to one English source in the late 19th century, only the emperor's immediate body guard wore armour of any kind, and these guards were all nobles of the imperial family.\n\n\n"}

His parents were deeply religious but the village lacked enough Jews to support a prayer service so Yehezkel studied at home until the yeshivas of Telz, Mir, Slabodka and particularly Brisk under Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik. At the age of 17 he became a rabbi, serving, in turn, the communities of Smolyan, Smalyavichy and Slutsk. Following the Russian Revolution, he was at the forefront of opposition to the Communist government's attempts to repress the Jewish religion and culture. As a result, the Russian government refused Abramsky permission to leave and take up the rabbinate of Petah Tikva in Palestine in both 1926 and 1928. In 1926, while serving as the rabbi of Slutsk, he joined (together with Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin) the \"Vaad Harabbonim of the U.S.S.R\".\n\nIn 1928, he started a Hebrew magazine, \"Yagdil Torah\" (lit. \"Make [the] Torah Great\"), but the Soviet authorities closed it after the first two issues had appeared. In 1929, he was arrested and sentenced to five years hard labor in Siberia, where he is said to have composed Talmudic commentaries on translucent cigarette papers. However, in 1931 he was released due to intervention by the German government under Chancellor Brüning, who exchanged him for six communists they held.\n\nHe arrived in London towards the end of 1931, where he was appointed rabbi of the Machzike Hadath community in London's East End. In 1934, Chief Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz persuaded him to become the senior dayan of the London Beth Din, a post he held until he retired to Jerusalem in 1951. The appointment of an East European chareidi rabbi to the London Beth Din was a departure for the United Synagogue, and started a tradition which continues to the present day. The prestige of the London Beth Din as a world-ranking halachic authority was greatly enhanced through the appointment of Rabbi Abramsky as Rosh Beth Din. Although other renowned talmidei chachamim served both during and since his time—such as Dayan Aryeh Leib Grosnass (\"Lev Aryeh\") and Dayan Avrohom Rapoport (\"Be'er Avrohom\"), it was Dayan Abramsky above all who established the policies and customs that are followed by the London Beth Din to this day.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the London Beth Din, he settled in Jerusalem. While living there he also served as a rosh yeshiva of Slabodka yeshiva in Bnei Brak.\n\nRabbi Abramsky died in Jerusalem on September 19, 1976 (24 Elul 5736). His funeral was attended by over 40,000 people, making it one of the largest ever seen in the city. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot.\n\nIn 1909 he married Hendl Reizel, daughter of Rabbi Yisroel Yehonasan Yerushamski (or Yershamiski), the rabbi of Orla and of Thumen, and son-in-law, through his second marriage, of \"the Ridbaz,\" Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky.\n\nHe had four sons including Professor Chimen Abramsky, and was the grandfather of Professor Samson Abramsky and Jenny Abramsky.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Headed by the same ruling family, it was variously separate or united with its motherland and its Latin name was used for both indiscriminately. The mainland territory of Domnonée included Trégor, Dol-de-Bretagne through to Goélo, and Penthièvre.\n\nAt the time of the Roman conquest of Gaul, the rough area of later Domnonée was held by the pagan Curiosolite Gauls. Domnonée is said to have been founded in the 4th century by Christian Briton immigrants; it greatly expanded in the wake of subsequent waves of refugees from the Saxon invasions of Britain. Domnonée retained close political links between the Celtic territories in Britain (Wales, Cornwall, Devon), and the newly created Brittany. Many kings, princes, clerics and other leaders came over from Britain. The sea was a unifying rather than divisive factor. In the traditions relating to the settlement of Brittany by the Bretons there are several kingdoms of this kind. A number of legends and lives of Breton saints contain references to the close political ties between religious communities in Wales and Brittany. The close proximity resulted in possessions on both sides of the Channel by some religious orders. For example, the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Beauport, before Henry VIII, had parishes on the coast of Goélo and in Devon.\n\nIt has been suggested that the British and Breton branches were unified for a period. Conomor, who was killed fighting Clotaire I, king of the Franks, is referred to in stories from both Britain and Brittany. He would have been a British military leader who was guarding the Channel from attacks by pirates, perhaps in alliance with Childebert I, son of Clovis.\n\nIn 1034, the term was used to designate the \"comté\" of Penthièvre said to be the preserve of Eudes, second son of Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany. The name disappeared shortly after.\n\nSituated to the north east of Brittany, the earliest princes are mentioned in several Lives of the Saints.\nThe three Armorican principalities were all subservient to the King of Brittany. Until the reign of Jonas, the rulers of Domnonia were titled princes. After that, they supply the Kings of the Bretons, and Domnonia itself was elevated as a result.\n\n"}

He was a member of the editorial board of \"Kommunist,\" the organ of the Petrograd Committee of the party. Years before the October Revolution he pushed for a more militant party tactics, much to the annoyance of Lenin. He became the financial director of the governing body of the Moscow oblast, Sovnarkom, which exercised wide powers and had high ambitions of local rule, although it was abolished as early as June, 1918. His attempts at forming similar bodies proved short-lived.\n\nSmirnov served in the governing bureau of the Supreme Economic Council, set up in December 1917. His Left fraction initially dominated the Council and Lenin had to take their position into account.\n\nAt the 8th Party Congress of the Russian Communist Party, Smirnov appeared as a delegate from the 5th Army. On 20 March 1919, Smirnov gave a speech to the Congress on the use of former Tsarist officers (termed \"Specialists\" within the party) and of political commissars in the Red Army. Responding to accusations from Grigory Sokolnikov that he opposed the use of officers, which by this point had become a key part of Bolshevik military strategy, he denied favouring the use of partisan militias in the Russian Civil War. He did, however, warn of the inadequate political mechanisms that the Soviet authority had at its disposal to control the officer-specialists. Arguing for the repeal of \"Decree on Revolutionary Military Councils\", he said to the Congress:\n...The role of the political commissars is limited to the functions of supervision... Now that we have the political commissars with sufficient combat experience and able not to intervene when not needed, we must give them broader rights, a larger part in the direction of the armies.\nSmirnov regarded the commissars as an integral check on the potential disloyalty of the old-régime officers. This preference for so-called \"politicisation\" of the Red Army was shared by the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party in opposition, but largely rejected by Leon Trotsky, the People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs, who by 1919 exercised full control over the military. But in April 1919 the Central Committee of the RKP appointed Smirnov as the first organiser for ChON volunteers to support the Red Army in the civil-war effort.\n\nIn 1923 he belonged to those who signed The Declaration of 46. In 1926 Smirnov, together with Timofei Sapronov, formed the \"Group of 15\", which joined the United Opposition headed by Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev. They were expelled from the Communist Party at the 15th Party Congress in December 1927 along with the rest of the United Opposition. Later, on 31 December 1927 he was arrested and sentenced to expulsion from Moscow to the Ural region for 3 years. On 29 January 1930, he was sentenced again, for 3 years in prison. On 10 November 1932, the term was extended with 2 years. And on 4 November 1934, he was sent for 3 years in Siberia. After the assassination of Kirov, in March 1935, Smirnov was arrested again and by a special decision of NKVD from 22 May 1935, was re-imprisoned for 3 years. In early 1937, while serving in the Suzdal special prison, Smirnov sent letters to the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs Yezhov and the USSR Prosecutor Vyshinsky, protesting against his detention. On April 20 the same year, he was transferred to Moscow and, on 26 May 1937, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court USSR under the chairmanship of V. Ulrich sentenced him to death for participating in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization. Smirnov was shot on the same day, becoming a victim of the Great Purge.\n\nOn 16 November 1960, Smirnov was partially rehabilitated but not was fully rehabilitated until 1990.\n"}

She was published seminaked in two issues of Playboy magazine (in April 1978 for French edition and in April 1979 for Spanish edition). In addition, she had five Top 10 hits on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nAt the age of 20, Madleen was discovered by J.C. Friederich, owner of Boona Music productions. She became a popular singer working in 1978 with her album \"Rough Diamond\", which became popular not only in the U.S., but across the globe. After she released \"Cheri\" in 1979, her singing career took off. Madleen's debut album \"Rough Diamond\" (1978) was originally released in France by CBS and soon after by Warner Bros. in North America. It became a hit on the Billboard Dance Chart. For this album, she recorded a disco version of \"C'est si bon\". Paris-based production team Michaele, Lana & Paul Sébastian produced the album. They have also worked with Theo Vaness and on \"Argentina Forever\" by Pacific Blue.\n\n\"Cheri\" (1979), was Kane's 2nd CBS Disques S.A. / Warner Bros. release, which featured \"Forbidden Love\", a dramatic \"pop-opus\" arranged by Thor Baldursson. The A-side suite of \"Forbidden Love\", the title track, its breakdown \"Fire In My Heart\" and \"Secret Love Affair\" gave her another club hit, which ran for over 15 minutes. Jim Burgess remixed it for a single, which was edited to just over eight minutes. The ballad \"You and I\", has become a wedding day favourite in Canada.\n\nUnlike the North American albums, the French releases of \"Rough Diamond\" and \"Cheri\" had gatefold sleeves. In addition, the American mix of \"Forbidden Love\" is different from that released in other countries. The track \"I Want You, Need You, Love You\" was omitted from the North American release.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Madleen moved to Chalet Records, part of Prelude Records, and released her third album, \"Sounds Of Love\" (1980). It featured \"Cherchez Pas\", which was more \"electronic\" as opposed to her usual symphonic disco songs, and peak #18 in Sweden. Madleen later worked with producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. Nevertheless, Giorgio Moroder appeared with his mixes in 1981 with \"Don't wanna Lose You\" and helped her album sales in Clubs but no longer in radios. \"You Can\" (1981), the \"Flashdance\"-esque lead single from those sessions spent three weeks on top of the Billboard Dance charts. It also got to number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1982 and was Kane's only entry on that chart. The album \"Don't Wanna Lose You\" followed. This was again released on Chalet Records, which was owned by her then-husband Jean-Claude Friederich and distributed by dance promoter Tom Hayden and his TSR Record Company, which was to be Madleen's next record label. Other big hits: \"Playing For Time,\" \"You Can,\" \"I'm No Angel,\" \"Fire in My Heart\".\n\nLondon's Ian Anthony Stephens and Megatone recording artist Paul Parker teamed up to provide Madleen with \"I'm No Angel\", a Billboard Dance Hit from her 1985 album, \"Cover Girl\". Madleen, tired of recording, faded away after this album.\n\nA collection of her hits, \"12 Inches And More\" (1994) was her final release. She was apparently bored with the recording process. \"12 Inches And More\" does not feature any of the extended mixes from her early career. Album versions are used in place of the remixes, possibly due to licensing issues. In January 2010, Madleen's first two albums were reissued on the MP3 via Amazon.com.\n\nIn 2011, Gold Legion reissued her album \"Rough Diamond\" on cd. \nIn June 2016, Madleen performed in Miami at the Cafe Iguana in Miami, Florida.

The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, and ratification.\n\nThe executive branch of the government of Florida consists of the governor, lieutenant governor, Florida Cabinet (which includes the attorney general, commissioner of agriculture and chief financial officer), and several executive departments. Each office term is limited for two four-year terms.\n\nThe governor of Florida is the chief executive of the government of Florida and the chief administrative officer of the state responsible for the planning and budgeting for the state, and serves as chair when the governor and the Florida Cabinet sit as a decision-making body in various constitutional roles. The governor has the power to execute Florida's laws and to call out the state militia to preserve the public peace, being commander-in-chief of the state's military forces that are not in active service of the United States. At least once every legislative session, the governor is required to deliver the \"State of the State Address\" to the Florida Legislature regarding the condition and operation of the state government and to suggest new legislation.\n\nFlorida is unique among U.S. states in having a strong cabinet-style government. Members of the Florida Cabinet are independently elected, and have equal footing with the governor on issues under the Cabinet's jurisdiction. The Cabinet consists of the attorney general, the commissioner of agriculture and the chief financial officer. Along with the governor, each member carries one vote in the decision making process. In the event of a tie, the side of the governor is the prevailing side. Cabinet elections are held every four years, on even numbered years not divisible by four (such as 2010, 2014, etc.).\n\nThe Florida attorney general is the state's chief legal officer. As defined in the Florida Constitution, the attorney general appoints a statewide prosecutor who may prosecute violations of criminal law occurring in or affecting two or more judicial circuits. The attorney general is responsible for the Department of Legal Affairs. The attorney general is head of the Florida Department of Legal Affairs.\n\nThe Florida chief financial officer's duties include monitoring the state's finances and fiscal well being, auditing and assuring that state programs are properly spending money and overseeing the proper management of the revenue and spending of the state. The chief financial officer is the head of the Florida Department of Financial Services (FDFS).\n\nThe Florida commissioner of agriculture is the head of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).\n\nThe purpose of agencies is to promulgate rules to implement legislation. In April 2014, there were 25,362 administrative rules, and eight agencies have over 1,000 rules each, of which the most heavily regulated agencies are the Department of Financial Services and Department of Health. The \"Florida Administrative Register\" (FAR) is the daily publication containing proposed rules and notices of state agencies. The regulations are codified in the \"Florida Administrative Code\" (FAC). There are also numerous decisions, opinions and rulings of state agencies.\n\nThe state had about 122,000 employees in 2010.\n\nThe Florida Constitution mandates a bicameral state legislature, consisting of a Florida Senate of 40 members and a Florida House of Representatives of 120 members. The two bodies meet in the Florida State Capitol. The Florida House of Representative members serve for two-year terms, while Florida Senate members serve staggered four-year terms, with 20 senators up for election every two years. Members of both houses are term limited to serve a maximum of eight years. There are also state auditors led by the Florida auditor general who is appointed by the Joint Legislative Auditing Committee, the utility-regulating Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), and the Florida Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA).\n\nThe legislature's session is part-time, meeting for 60-day regular sessions annually. The regular session of the Florida Legislature commences on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March with the governor's State of the State speech before a joint session and ends on the last Friday in April or the first Friday in May. The Florida Legislature often meets in special sessions, sometimes as many as a half dozen in a year, that are called for particular purposes, such as budget reduction or reforming property insurance. A special session may be called by the governor, by joint proclamation of the speaker of the House and senate president or by three-fifths vote of the members of both houses. Outside of these regular and special sessions, the members of both houses participate in county delegation meetings and interim committee meetings throughout the year, mostly from November to February in advance of the regular session.\n\nIts session laws are compiled into the \"Laws of Florida\", and the \"Florida Statutes\" are the codified statutory laws of the state which have general applicability.\n\nThe Florida State Courts System is the unified state court system. The Florida State Courts System consists of the:\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of Florida is the highest court of Florida and consists of seven judges: the chief justice and six justices. The Court is the final arbiter of Florida law, and its decisions are binding authority for all other state courts. The five Florida District Courts of Appeal are the intermediate appellate courts.\n\nThe 20 Florida circuit courts are trial courts of original jurisdiction for most controversies. The circuit courts primarily handle civil cases where the amount in controversy is greater than $15,000, and felony criminal cases, as well as appeals from county courts. Circuit courts also have jurisdiction over domestic relations, juvenile dependency, juvenile delinquency, and probate matters. The 67 Florida county courts have original jurisdiction over misdemeanor criminal cases, including violations of county and municipal ordinances, and in civil cases whose value in controversy does not exceed $15,000.\n\nEach civil entity has its own budget: state, county, and municipal.\n\nIn June 2015, the state's debt was $25.7 billion.\n\nThe commissioners charged by the government of the unified Florida to select a permanent capital selected Tallahassee, then between the two major cities of Florida, Pensacola and Saint Augustine, as the state capital, in 1823. The White people expelled the Native Americans, who were opposed to leaving their land, before settling Tallahassee. The commissioners were Dr. W.H. Simmons, from St. Augustine, and John Lee Williams, from Pensacola. Richard Keith Call and a founder of Jacksonville, John Bellamy, wanted the capital in what is now Lake County but their efforts failed.\n\nFrom the beginning of Tallahassee's history there were multiple attempts to move the state capital. A July 1957 \"Florida Historical Quarterly\" article stated that this was because of Tallahassee's distance from other settlements.\n\nAs Florida's size and population grew and spread south, the center of the state's population and the geographic center of the state changed. Using data from the 2010 U.S. Census, according to the Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research, the state's center of population was southern Polk County. The geographic center of the state is Brooksville. Because Tallahassee became increasingly far from many Floridians, there were additional proposals to move the capital to Orlando, a more centrally-located city, in the late 1960s. The City of Orlando, in 1967, passed a referendum stating that it would accept becoming the capital. These proposals stopped after the new Florida Capitol opened in Tallahassee in 1977. Politicians from North Florida had opposed the idea of moving the state capital. Adam C. Smith of the \"Tampa Bay Times\" argued in 2016 that Tallahassee is no longer an appropriate location for the capital, and he cited an \"American Economic Review\" article which stated that state capitals far from their populations are more prone to corruption than those that are not.\n\nThere are four types of local governments in Florida: counties, municipalities, school districts, and special districts.\n\nFlorida consists of 67 counties. Each county has officers considered \"state\" officers: these officials are elected locally, and their salaries and office expenses are also paid locally, but they cannot be removed from office or replaced locally, but only by the governor. The state officers subject to this requirement are the sheriff, state's attorney, public defender, tax collector, supervisor of elections, clerk of the circuit court (though styled as such, each circuit having multiple counties within its jurisdiction has a separate elected clerk within each county, and the office also handles official county records not pertaining to judicial matters), property appraiser, and judges.\n\nThere is one school district for each county; the Florida Constitution allows adjoining counties to merge their districts upon voter approval. The superintendent is by default an elected official; however, the Florida Constitution allows county voters to make the position an appointed one.\n\nMunicipalities in Florida may be called towns, cities, or villages, but there is no legal distinction between the different terms. Municipalities often have police departments, fire departments, and provide essential services such as water, waste collection, etc. In unincorporated areas of a county, the county itself can provide some of these services. Municipalities may also enter agreements with the county to have the county provide certain services. Each county has a sheriff who also tends to have concurrent jurisdiction with municipal police departments.\n\nBoth counties and cities may have a legislative branch (commissions or councils) and executive branch (mayor or manager) and local police, but violations are brought before a county court. Counties and municipalities are authorized to pass laws (ordinances), levy taxes, and provide public services within their jurisdictions. All areas of Florida are located within a county, but only some areas have been incorporated into municipalities. All municipalities are located within a county and the county jurisdiction overlays the municipal jurisdiction. Usually, if there is a conflict between a county ordinance and a municipal ordinance, the municipal ordinance has precedence within the municipality's borders; however, the overlaying county's ordinances have precedence if the overlaying county has been designated a charter county by the Florida Legislature.\n\nIn some cases, the municipal and county governments have merged into a consolidated government. However, smaller municipal governments can be created inside of a consolidated municipality/county. In Jacksonville, the municipal government has taken over the responsibilities normally given to the county government, Duval County, and smaller municipalities exist within it.\n\nAmong special districts are \"community development districts\" which have virtually all the power of a city or county (except, notably, they do not have police power). Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes governs these districts. Notable CDD's include the Reedy Creek Improvement District (the location of Walt Disney World) and substantially all of The Villages (the giant Central Florida retirement community).\n\nMany counties have a \"Soil and Water Conservation District,\" a residue of Dust Bowl politics. Elected officials are unpaid. Much of their budget is spent on engineering staff. Critics are trying to dismantle these districts, as being obsolete.\n\n\n"}

The guns were also used by the German, Romanian, and Argentine armies of the time.\n\nOriginally designed by Beretta's chief engineer Tullio Marengoni in 1935, the \"Moschetto Automatico Beretta\" (Beretta Automatic Musket) 38, or MAB 38, was developed from the Beretta \"Modello\" 18 and 18/30, derived from the Villar Perosa light machine gun of World War I. It is widely acknowledged as the most successful and effective Italian small arm of World War II and was produced in large numbers in several variants. Italy's limited industrial base in World War II was no real barrier toward the development of advanced and effective small arms, since most weapons did require large amounts of artisan and semi-artisan man-hours to be fine-tuned and made reliable by default. Italian specialized workers excelled and the initial slow rate of production meant that the MAB 38 became available in large numbers only in 1943, when the fascist regime was toppled and Italy split between the Allied-aligned co-belligerent forces in the south and German collaborationists of the Italian Social Republic in the north.\n\nThe MAB 38 was developed by Beretta to compete in the rich market of machine and sub-machine guns; it was a well-made and sturdy weapon, introducing several advanced features and was suitable for police and special army units. Presented to Italian authorities in 1939, its first customer was the Italian Ministry of Colonies, which purchased several thousands MABs to be issued as standard firearm of the \"Polizia dell'Africa Italiana\" (Italian Africa Constabulary), the government colonial police force. Army orders were slow to come; although impressed by excellent qualities and firepower of the weapon, the Italian military did not feel the MAB was suitable for standard infantry combat. It was judged ideal for police and assault units and in the beginning of 1941 small orders were placed for \"Carabinieri\" (military and civilian police), \"Guardie di Pubblica Sicurezza\" (national state police), and paratroopers. The Italian Army requested minor changes to reduce production costs, notably the changed shape of the recoil compensator and the removal of the bayonet and catch as the MAB 38A. This was the standard army variant, used throughout the war and issued to elite Italian units, paratroopers, Alpini \"Monte Cervino\" assault battalion, 10th \"Arditi\" Regiment, \"M\" Battalions of \"Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale\" (\"MVSN\", Blackshirts) and military police.\n\nThe Italian Royal Navy also purchased the type and MAB 38A were given to the \"\"San Marco\"\" Marine Regiment and naval security troops; The \"Regia Aeronautica\" (Italian Royal Air Force) issued the MAB 38A to its crack A.D.R.A. Regiment. Orders were still small and the Carcano M1891 rifle remained the standard weapon even in elite units. Until 1943, MAB 38A (and since 1942, the MAB 38/42) was available almost exclusively to paratroopers, Blackshirts, tank crews and Carabinieri military police, given the need of all of the former to express high volumes of firepower in prolonged actions or to keep close-quarters combat superiority. The paratroopers of the 185th Airborne Division \"Folgore\" was armed exclusively with the weapon. Blackshirt legions (one per infantry division) were regarded and used as elite assault units both for their fanaticism and their Beretta 38s.\n\nAfter the Italian armistice of September 8, 1943, the Italian armed forces melted away and an Italian army was reconstructed in northern Italy under German sponsorship, the Beretta MAB equipped many units. The Italian Social Republic (R.S.I.) army fought a guerrilla war against partisans from the start, as well as against the Allies. For assault and counterinsurgency units, where firepower at close range was a vital asset, it was the ideal weapon. Production of the MAB became priority and it was supplied in great numbers to R.S.I. formations, especially elite units and it became an iconic weapon, symbolizing the Italian soldier in popular culture. Later in the war, a simplified variant known as the MAB 38/44 was introduced. Regardless of the tables of organization and equipment of a unit, the Beretta 38 was a popular weapon that could eventually find its way into the hands of virtually any soldier, especially amongst officers and higher non-commissioned officers, in any type of unit.\n\nA magazine-holding vest was designed for elite troops (Blackshirts, paratroopers) armed with the Beretta 38; these were dubbed \"\"Samurai\"\" due to the similarity of the stacked magazines with traditional Japanese armour. A special canvas holster was issued with the MAB with two magazine-carrier pouches sewn on, to be worn as a belt but only came into use during the brief life of the R.S.I. and by then could be seen in the employ of many different units whose \"elite\" status could have been reasonably questioned (such as Black Brigades and other militias). The Beretta MAB was highly praised by Italian resistance movement fighters as well, being far more accurate and powerful than the British Sten which was common issue in partisan units, although the smaller Sten was more suited for clandestine operations. German soldiers also liked the Beretta MAB, judging it large and heavy, but reliable and well made.\n\nThe 1938 series was extremely robust and proved very popular with Axis forces as well as Allied troops, who used captured examples. Many German soldiers, including elite forces such as the Waffen-SS and Fallschirmjäger forces, preferred the Beretta 38. Germany manufactured 231,193 Beretta M38s in 1944 and 1945. Firing a powerfully loaded Italian version of the widely distributed 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, the \"Cartuccia 9 mm M38\", the Beretta was accurate at longer ranges than most other submachine guns. The MAB could deliver an impressive firepower at close range and at longer distances its size and weight was an advantage, making the weapon stable and easy to control. In expert hands, the Beretta MAB allowed accurate short-bursts shooting up to and its effective range with Italian M38 ammunition, was s, an impressive result for a 9 mm submachine gun.\n\nMAB 38, in its first variants, was a fine weapon by any standard, crafted with high quality materials, flawlessly finished and with carefully machined parts. Models 38/42 and 38/44 were easier and faster to build, the finish was sacrificed for speed of production but the quality remained high. The mechanism was a traditional simple blowback recoil but with a novel floating firing pin, an automatic safety on open bolt (both later removed to save production costs), a recoil compensator on the muzzle, a bolt cocking handle with sliding dust cover and a striking trigger gear with no fire selector but with two triggers instead; the fore trigger was for semi-automatic fire and rear trigger for full-auto. The user could shift quickly between methods without switching levers or safety catches, which proved useful in combat. The full-auto trigger had a safety catch on left side, which was eliminated from 1942 and the rear sight was adjustable up to in the MAB 38 and 38A, the 38/42 and 38/44 variants had fixed rear sights. The MAB 38 had a wooden stock, was about long and weighed about when loaded, with an effective range of about .\n\nThe Model 1938 can be recognized by its machined steel receiver, fine craftsmanship and finish and by the perforated cooling jacket over the barrel. It was produced from 1938 to 1950 and fired 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition at 600 rounds per minute. It used 10, 20, 30 or 40-round magazines; the short 10-round magazine, when used in conjunction with the fixed bayonet, was popular with Allied and Axis forces for guarding prisoners or internal security. In combat, the 30 round magazine was the most common. The original MAB 38, first issued to Italian police in 1939, had a bayonet mount and stock rest for the Carcano M91/38 folding bayonet.\n\nIn compliance with Italian army requirements, bayonet mount and rest were eliminated and the recoil compensator was redesigned, the two horizontal muzzle slots substituted by 4 transversal cuttings, judged more effective. This standard army variant was renamed MAB 38A and issued in 1941. Despite its undeniable effectiveness, the Beretta Model 38 proved too time-consuming and expensive to produce during wartime. Marengoni designed a simplified model made from sheet steel, in which the cooling jacket and bayonet mount were eliminated and the separate firing pin mechanism replaced by a fixed firing pin machined on the face of the bolt. The barrel and wooden stock were also shortened to save weight and cost. This new model the Model 38/42 had a fluted barrel to aid cooling and save weight. It also had a slower rate of fire (550 rpm). The Model 38/43, was an intermediate production stage between the 42 and 44 patterns. The 38/42 and 38/43 were adopted by the Wehrmacht as the Maschinenpistole 738(i), abbreviated as MP.738. Models produced for the German Army received German acceptance marks.\n\nThe Model 38/44 was a minor revision of the 38/43, in which the bolt was simplified and a large-diameter recoil spring used in place of the operating spring guide. It also eliminated the fluting to save time and increase production. The 38/44 was also adopted by the German army as the MP.739. A variant of the Model 38/44 was fitted with an MP40-style under-folding stock as the Model 1.\n\nAfter World War II, the 38/44 continued in production in slightly revised form as the 38/49 series: the Model 2 or MP 38/44 Special with an MP40-style under-folding stock and extended magazine well, the Model 3 with an extended magazine well and telescoping steel-wire buttstock and the Model 4 with a standard wooden rifle stock. All of these models have a push-button cross-bolt safety catch at the middle of the stock After Marengoni's death, Beretta engineer Domenico Salza revised the safety system of the Model 38/49 series as the Model 5, identified by a large rectangular grip-safety button located in the stock's finger groove. The Model 5 was produced for the Italian Army, police and the armed forces of several other nations until 1961, when production ceased in favor of the compact, modern Beretta M12.\n\nUnusually, it ejects to the left because of the non-reciprocating cocking/charging handle and slot cover being in the way on the right side.\n\n\n\n"}

The third and final of the pair's albums for the label, it is a suite of selections from the George Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. Orchestral arrangements are by Russell Garcia, who had previously arranged the 1956 jazz vocal recording \"The Complete Porgy and Bess\".\n\nIn 1959, a big-budget film version produced by Samuel Goldwyn and directed Otto Preminger arrived in theaters. To coincide with the film, many jazz and vocal versions of the work were produced on records, this one and the celebrated Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaboration among them. The double album was released in both mono and stereo, and on compact disc in 1990. It is also part of the set \"The Complete Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong on Verve\" issued in 1997. Given the nature of the work, only five tracks feature vocals by both Armstrong and Fitzgerald.\n\nIn 2001, it was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, a special achievement prize established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\" The album is considered the most musically successful amongst the jazz vocal versions of the opera.\n\nThe AllMusic review of the album claimed \"What's really great about the Ella and Louis version is Ella, who handles each aria with disarming delicacy, clarion intensity, or usually a blend of both... Pops sounds like he really savored each duet, and his trumpet work – not a whole lot of it, because this is not a trumpeter's opera – is characteristically good as gold. This marvelous album stands quite well on its own, but will sound best when matched with the Ray Charles/Cleo Laine version, especially the songs of the Crab Man, of Peter the Honey Man, and his wife, Lily the Strawberry Woman.\"\n\n\"All music written by George Gershwin; all lyrics by Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward except where noted.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Order of the Redeemer is the oldest and highest decoration awarded by the modern Greek state.\n\nThe establishment of the Order of the Redeemer was decided by the Fourth National Assembly at Argos in 1829, during the final year of the Greek War of Independence. The decision was not immediately implemented, however, and the relevant decree was signed in Nafplio by the Regency Council (Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, Karl von Abel and Georg Ludwig von Maurer) in the name of King Otto on May 20, 1833. According to the decree of establishment, the name of the Order \"shall recall the, by divine assistance miraculously and fortuitously accomplished, salvation of Greece\".\n\nSince its establishment in 1833, and in common with all Greek orders of merit, the Order of the Redeemer has five classes:\n\nAccording to the original decree, the Order was to be awarded to those Greek citizens who took part in the War of Independence, or \"who should distinguish themselves henceforth in any branch of public service, in the army and navy, in the diplomatic and judicial corps, in public administration, in the arts, science, agriculture and industry, commerce, or should distinguish themselves in any other social field through outstanding civic virtue, and through illustrious services to the Throne, for the Glory of the Hellenic name and for the welfare of the fatherland\", while foreigners were admitted either for past services to Greece, or due to their ability \"to bring honour to the Order, through their outstanding personal virtues and excellence\".\n\nThe original decree set specific limits on the number of awards: while the Silver Cross could be awarded at will, Gold Crosses were limited to 120, Commanders to 30, Grand Commanders to 20, and Grand Crosses to 12. Foreign recipients, as well as princes of the Greek royal family, did not count to these totals. In modern times, in practice the Grand Cross is awarded only to foreign heads of state.\n\nThe first person to be awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer was King Ludwig I of Bavaria, the father of King Otto, in 1833. Other distinguished recipients included Andreas Miaoulis in 1835, Baron Guenther Heinrich von Berg on 21 February 1837 Petrobey Mavromichalis, Alexandros Mavrokordatos and Lazaros Kountouriotis in 1836, Andreas Zaimis, Theodoros Kolokotronis and Georgios Kountouriotis in 1837, and Constantine Kanaris in 1864.\n\nThe form of the various insignias has been altered a number of times since the establishment of the order, the most obvious change being the removal of the crown during the periods of republican rule. The present form of insignias is regulated by Presidential Decree 849/1975 (ΦΕΚ 273 Α΄/4-12-1975).\n\nThe original decree of 1833 described the \"badge\" of the Order as consisting of a white enamelled Maltese cross (silver for the Silver Cross, gold for the higher grades), surmounted by a crown, set on a green enamelled wreath, one half of which is an oak branch and the other half a laurel branch. The obverse featured a white cross on a blue background (the coat of arms of Greece) with Otto's Bavarian arms in an inescutcheon in the centre, surrounded by this inscription on an outer ring: \"Η ΔΕΞΙΑ ΣΟΥ ΧΕΙΡ, ΚΥΡΙΕ, ΔΕΔΟΞΑΣΤΑΙ ΕΝ ΙΣΧΥΙ\" (\"Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power\", Exodus, 15:6). The reverse featured a portrait of Otto with the circular inscription: \"ΟΘΩΝ, ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΤΗΣ ΕΛΛΑΔΟΣ\" (\"Otto, King of Greece\").\nAfter Otto's deposition in 1863, his portrait was removed and substituted by an icon of Jesus, the \"Redeemer\" of Orthodox Christian soteriology. This resulted in the wearing of this side as the obverse, with the national coat of arms (purged of the Bavarian escutcheon) relegated to the reverse, and the inscriptions correspondingly changed: the obverse's inscription remained in place, and the reverse came to feature a new inscription: \"Η ΕΝ ΑΡΓΕΙ Δ´ ΕΘΝΙΚΗ ΤΩΝ ΕΛΛΗΝΩΝ ΣΥΝΕΛΕΥΣΙΣ - 1829\" (\"The IV National Assembly of the Hellenes at Argos – 1829\").\n\nThe \"star\" of the Order is an eight-pointed faceted silver star with the same central disc as on the badge of the Order. At first the stars were embroidered, but eventually, they were made of solid silver, a practice that continues to this day.\n\nThe \"ribbon\" of the Order is light blue, edged with white, reflecting the national colours of Greece.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175284", "title": "Rotary car dumper", "text": "Rotary car dumper\n\nA rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a mechanism used for unloading certain railroad cars such as hopper cars, gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail car to a section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be lower, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.\n\nIn 1893, Timothy Long filed for a patent on a rotary car dumper. This dumper required the car to be uncoupled because the dumper rolled the car to the side as it dumped.\nIn 1901, Erskine Ramsay filed for a patent on a rotary dumper where the center of rotation of the dumper was aligned with the coupling. When combined with Janney couplers that were free to rotate, this permitted dumping cars without uncoupling them from the train.\n\nThe rotary mine-car dumper offered by the Ottumwa Box-Car Loader Company in 1909 could dump five relatively small mine cars per minute. Prior to this, the common method of dumping mine cars was to tip them endwise.\n\nBy 1921, the Car Dumper Equipment Company was offering a wide variety of rotary dumpers, including not only standard gauge dumpers, but also dumpers for use on mine railways; some of the latter were designed to dump an entire train in one operation.\n\nThe primary alternative to rotary dumping has long been provided by a wide variety of self-unloading cars. Most of these are bottom-dump cars of various sorts, equipped with doors of one sort or another at the bottom to allow bulk cargo to be unloaded by gravity. Drop-bottom gondolas, for example, are low-sided open-topped cars where much of the floor of the car is composed of trapdoors. While drop-bottom cars could usually be used for other purposes, side-dump cars and hopper cars with sloping floors to guide the cargo to unloading doors can only be used for bulk cargo. All of these have the advantage that they can be unloaded anywhere, but the disadvantage that any imperfection in the seals of the doors allows material to spill onto the track.\n\nIn the mining industry, the long established standard for dumping mine cars was to run them into horns at the ends of the rails at the tipple. The inertia of the car would cause it and sometimes a short segment of hinged rail to tip forward, dumping the load out the end of the car. Some of these dump mechanisms completely overturned the car end-for-end, and some allowed the car to continue onward after being dumped. In the 19th century, a patent was issued for a machine to tip entire railroad cars endwise for unloading.\n\nBulk cargo such as grain shipped in boxcars poses particular problems. The Ottumwa Box Car Loader Company built boxcar unloaders that both tipped the car sideways and rocked it end for end so that the cargo would spill out the side door. One of these machines was in use in Portland, Oregon in 1921.\n"}

I-464 connects two major highway junctions in the South Hampton Roads region. At its southern end, the Interstate meets two major highways that head toward North Carolina, US 17 and SR 168, and I-64, which follows the southern side of the Hampton Roads Beltway. At its northern terminus, I-464 has connections with Downtown Norfolk and Portsmouth via I-264.\n\nI-464 begins in the city of Chesapeake at the northern end of the directional interchange between US 17 (Dominion Boulevard) and SR 168 (Oak Grove Connector). US 17 heads south toward the Inner Banks community of Elizabeth City. SR 168 heads south toward the Outer Banks, including Nags Head and Manteo. Just north of I-464's terminus is a cloverleaf interchange with I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway), between which US 17 and SR 168 run concurrently with northbound and southbound I-464, respectively. US 17 and SR 168 join I-64 for their own short concurrencies, with US 17 heading west toward Suffolk and SR 168 heading east toward Virginia Beach.

In 2013, he earned $21 million, according to \"Forbes\" estimate.\n\nPeters's stand-up performances feature observational comedy, using humour to highlight racial, ethnic, class and cultural stereotypes. He often refers to his own experiences growing up in an Anglo-Indian family, and impersonates the accents of various ethnic groups to poke fun at them. As he told an audience in San Francisco, \"I don't make the stereotypes, I just see them.\" In a 2006 interview with \"The National,\" Peters observed that he did not intend to put down or offend different races and cultures, but tried to \"raise them up through humour\".\n\nPeters is widely known for his punchline, \"Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad.\" It ends a joke he tells about his childhood with a traditional Indian father, who used corporal punishment on his sons. Another punchline he uses is \"Be a man! Do the right thing!\", which relates to a story of a Chinese man trying to get him to pay more for an item at a shop.\n\nWhen interviewer Larry King asked Peters, \"Is there such a thing as too taboo?\", Peters replied, \"I don't talk about religion because I think people are a little weird about religion, especially nowadays, and I'm more of a science guy than I am a beliefs guy. I'm more into facts than I am into beliefs.\" In an interview with \"Al Jazeera\", Peters said he refuses to talk about religion. Subsequently, in a 2018 \"Kill Tony\" podcast, he identified \"as an atheist\".\n\nPeters proposed to girlfriend Monica Diaz on July 10, 2010 at the Los Angeles International Airport and announced their engagement via Twitter. The couple married on August 20, 2010 at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The wedding was attended by about 20 guests, including an Elvis impersonator. Soon after, Peters told \"The Canadian Press\" that Diaz was pregnant, saying, \"Did I get married because she was knocked up? I would say that expedited it.\" Their daughter named Crystianna Marie Peters, was born two months early on December 14, 2010. In a March 2012 interview, Peters revealed that he and Diaz were divorcing.\n\nIn October 2016, it was announced that Peters was engaged to Ruzanna Khetchian. After the engagement was called off, Peters announced on December 4, 2018, via Twitter, that he and his girlfriend Jennifer Andrade were expecting a child. Andrade was the Miss Universe Honduras in 2012. The following April, it was announced that Andrade had given birth to a boy, whom they named Russell Santiago Peters.\n\nPeters lives in Los Angeles, California and owns two homes there. He also owns homes in Las Vegas and Vaughan, Ontario.\n\nIn 2010, Peters established the Russell Peters North Peel Scholarship, an award worth up to $21,000 and intended to finance up to three years of college. It will be awarded annually to a student from Judith Nyman Secondary School (formerly North Peel) with a strong academic record and the intention of attending college.\n\nRussell Peters has appeared in many films. He acted in the Punjabi-Canadian \"Breakaway\" (2011), alongside Camilla Belle, Anupam Kher, and Vinay Virmani. That year he also acted in Duncan Jones's \"Source Code\" (2011) as Max, an amateur comedian with a bad attitude; and as Pervius in \"\" (2011).\n\nHe appeared in \"Senior Skip Day\" (2008), which starred Larry Miller, Tara Reid, and Gary Lundy. That year he was also in \"The Take\" (2008) as Dr. Sharma. Earlier he had cameo roles in \"Boozecan\" (1994) as Snake's Friend, \"Tiger Claws III\" (2000) as Detective Elliott, \"My Baby's Daddy\" (2004) as the obstetrician, and \"Quarter Life Crisis\" (2006) as Dilip Kumar.\n\nPeters has guest-starred on the TV series \"Mr. D\" as the school superintendent. In 2011, he starred in a Canadian TV Christmas special, \"A Russell Peters Christmas\". Guests included Michael Bublé, Pamela Anderson and Jon Lovitz. The show attracted the highest number of viewers of any CTV Canadian holiday special.\n\n\n"}

UIS was established to provide students with a familial atmosphere to express their conservative beliefs. When UIS became a national organization in the early 1970s, it changed its name to Young America’s Foundation. Young America's Foundation held the first National Conservative Student Conference in 1979. It is a co-founder of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference and has been a prominent supporter of the event since then.\n\nIn 1998 it purchased the Reagan Ranch, \"Rancho del Cielo\", near Santa Barbara, California, with the help of a $10 million endowment from Amway billionaires Richard and Helen DeVos. The Ruhes helped YAF \"retire the Reagan Ranch note early\". YAF president Ron Robinson commented that YAF's goal was \"preserving and protecting\" both Reagan's legacy and the ranch itself and that it would maintain the facilities as they existed when the Reagans lived there.\n\nAccording to an article in \"Time\" by John Cloud, by 2004, there were no left-wing youth organizations as powerful as The Young America's Foundation (YAF), The Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) and The Leadership Institute. The same author stated, a \"majority of 2003 freshmen — 53% — wanted affirmative action abolished, compared with only 43% of all adults. Two-thirds of frosh favored abortion rights in 1992; only 55% did so in last year's survey. Support for gun control has slipped in recent years among the young, and last year 53% of students believed that \"wealthy people should pay a larger share of taxes than they do now,\" compared with 72% 11 years earlier\".\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", by 2005, there was a \"renewed shift pronouncedly to the right on many defining issues\". Young Americans for Freedom, Young America's Foundation, the Leadership Institute, the Collegiate Network, and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute college organizations that were \"fueled and often financed by an array of conservative interest groups\". By 2005, \"51 percent of freshmen were for [casual sex] in 1987; [by 2005] 42 percent are. In 1989, 66 percent of freshmen believed abortion should be legal; [by 2005], only 54 percent do. In 1995, 66 percent of kids agreed that wealthy people should pay a larger share of taxes; [by 2005] it [was] down to 50 percent. Even on the issue of firearms, where students have traditionally favored stiffer controls, there has been a weakening in support for gun laws\".\n\nBy 2017, YAF had 250 high school and college affiliated known as Young Americans for Freedom, which was originally a separate organization.\n\nIn July 2019, it was announced that former Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker would become YAF's president in 2021.\n\nIn November 2019, YAF cut ties with one of their long-time featured speakers, Michelle Malkin, who voiced her support for alt-right journalist, Nick Fuentes.\n\nYoung America’s Foundation is a tax-exempt educational foundation. The Foundation's programs include lectures on college and high school campuses, conferences throughout the United States, and campus activism initiatives. These programs are broadcast on C-SPAN. Young America's Foundation also preserves the Ronald Reagan Ranch, runs the National Journalism Center (NJC), and oversees Young Americans for Freedom. \n\nThe National Journalism Center which was founded in 1977 by M. Stanton Evans, is currently a project of Young America's Foundation that places college students and recent graduates at media organizations in the Washington, D.C. area. Notable alumni include Ann Coulter, Tim Carney, and Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nOn March 16, 2011, Young Americans for Freedom passed a National Board Resolution which resulted in the merger of two organizations into the Young America's Foundation on April 1, 2011.\nYoung Americans for Freedom (YAF), was founded on September 11, 1960 at the family home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut. The charter for the Young Americans for Freedom, written by M. Stanton Evans, the Sharon Statement,was described by K.E.Grubbs in 2010 as \"the late 20th century's single most elegant distillation of conservative principles\". The Heritage Foundation described the Sharon Statement as \"statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas of modern American conservatism\".\n\nDonors include Pat Sajak, the Koch brothers, and Amway billionaires Richard and Helen DeVos. Robert Ruhe (1929 - 2013), an orthodontist in California, was the single largest donor of the YAF, with his legacy estate gift of $16 million. This resulted in a doubling of YAF's programming, which includes campus speeches. During his lifetime he and his wife donated generously to YAF, particularly in terms of paying off the mortgage of the Reagan Ranch.\n\n"}

He spent most of the next year orchestrating, beginning February 12, 1846. His depression and poor health, including ringing in his ears, prevented him finishing the work until October 19. The uplifting tone of the symphony is thus remarkable considering Schumann's health problems during the time of its composition - the work can be seen as a Beethovenian triumph over fate/pessimism, as Beethoven himself described in the Heiligenstadt Testament.\n\nThe year of 1845 was important for Schumann because it signaled a shift in his compositional strategy. He began to compose away from the piano, as he noted in his writing: \n\nNot until the year 1845, when I began to conceive and work out everything in my head, did an entirely different manner of composition begin to develop\n\nThe strategic shift above can be ascribed to his intensive study of counterpoint in the same year with his wife, Clara Schumann. Hence, this symphony can be seen as a direct product of his shift of compositional strategy and counterpoint study.\n\nIt is written in the traditional four-movement form, and as often in the nineteenth century the Scherzo precedes the Adagio. All four movements are in C major, except the first part of the slow movement (in C minor); the work is thus homotonal:\n\nThe first movement begins with a slow brass chorale, elements of which recur through the piece. (Schumann wrote the Six Organ Fugues on B-A-C-H, Op. 60, just before this symphony, and this preoccupation with Bach suggests a chorale prelude, a quintessential Bachian genre, in the texture and feeling of the symphony's opening. Possibly, too, Schumann was inspired by the sombre brass fanfare at the start of Haydn's 'London Symphony' (No. 104), which uses the same tonic-dominant progression.) The following Sonata-Allegro is dramatic and turbulent. It is characterized by sharp rhythmic formulae (double-dotted rhythms) and by the masterly transformation of the material of the Introduction.\n\nThe second movement is a scherzo in C major with two trios, whose main portion strongly emphasizes the diminished chord—its characteristic gesture being a rapid and playful resolution of this chord over unstable harmony. The second trio employs the B-A-C-H motif in the context of flowing eighth notes reminiscent of the Baroque, further suggesting that Bach remained on Schumann's mind after the completion of his Op. 60.\n\nThe\" Adagio espressivo\" is a sonata movement in C minor, with the character of an elegy, its middle section strongly contrapuntal in texture.\n\nThe finale is in a very freely treated sonata form, its second theme related to the opening theme of the Adagio. Later in the movement at bar 280, a new theme appears: this theme has, as its sources of inspiration, the last song from Beethoven's cycle \"An die ferne Geliebte\" (cf. also Schumann's Piano Fantasy in C, Op. 17 and String Quartet op. 41/2), and Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy.\" The coda of the Finale recalls the material from the Introduction, thereby thematically spanning the entire work.\n\nA typical performance lasts between 35 and 40 minutes. It is scored for an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets (in B), two bassoons, two French horns (in C), two trumpets (in C), three trombones (alto, tenor, and bass), timpani, and strings.\n\nThe symphony was first performed on November 5, 1846, at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig with Felix Mendelssohn conducting. It was better received after a second performance some ten days later. The work ultimately came to be admired in the nineteenth century for its \"perceived metaphysical content\", but the symphony's popularity waned in the twentieth, owing to its unusual structure.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Carvel in the 1970s as an expansion of its line of freshly made products, along with Hug-Me Bear and Cookie Puss.\n\nAlthough the cake depicts the shape of a whale and was originally decorated as such, it was sometimes adapted for holiday uses by rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that the whale's body, now upright, could represent a face. The whale's tail would then represent whatever a character traditionally had on its head: the Easter Bunny's ears, or a Santa Claus' tassel.

Like its predecessors, \"Mega Man X5\" is an action-platform game in which the player controls either protagonist through a series of eight, selectable stages and wins the special weapon of each stage's boss. However, the game only offers limited number of stage attempts before the player must deal with the colony.\n\nAccording to Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, \"Mega Man X5\" was originally intended to be the final game in the \"Mega Man X\" saga. Critical reception for the game was lukewarm, with many reviewers agreeing that the stale gameplay formula will only further satisfy diehard fans of the series. \"Mega Man X5\" was ported to the Microsoft Windows as retail packages in 2002 in both Japan and North America. It was also re-released in 2006 as part of the \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. \"Mega Man X5\" was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line for North America and Japan in 2014. It became available for Windows via Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as a part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan.\n\nSeveral months have passed since the events of \"Mega Man X4\". The series' primary antagonist, Sigma, has been revived once again, and conducts research on the origin of the \"Maverick Hunter\" Zero. He decides to attempt to unlock Zero's true power, hoping to destroy X in the process. Sigma attacks the Hunters directly, but intentionally loses, thus spreading the Sigma Virus across the Earth and throwing it into chaos. Meanwhile, a Reploid mercenary named Dynamo is hired by Sigma to cause a space colony, Eurasia, to collide with Earth in 16 hours. To prevent Eurasia from striking the planet, the Hunters pursue two options: fire a powerful cannon called \"Enigma\" at Eurasia and vaporize it, or if the Enigma fails, launch a space shuttle and pilot it into the colony, destroying it. To maximize their chances, X and Zero are dispatched to collect parts for the two devices with the aid of their new teammates Alia, Douglas, and Signas. The necessary parts to upgrade the Enigma and shuttle are held by eight Mavericks, and X and Zero must defeat them to claim the parts.\n\nWhether the Enigma and shuttle succeed or fail is randomly determined by the game. From this point, the story diverges into different subplots:\n\nWhether the Enigma/shuttle succeeds or fails, a new virus appears on the Earth, dubbed the \"Zero Virus\" by Alia. The location of the virus' origin is discovered, and the Hunters investigate a bizarre underground fortress (if Zero became a Maverick, only X is playable for the remainder of the game). Deep inside the fortress, X and Zero cross paths, where mutual suspicion and mistrust leads to a duel between the heroes.\n\nAfter the duel, Sigma appears to try and take advantage of the situation, and the story diverges slightly.\n\n\"Mega Man X5\" has three possible endings: \n\nThe main gameplay remains similar to previous installments. Unlike \"X4\", the player can freely switch between both the shooter X and the swordsman Zero while playing through the game. Depending on which character the player uses to start it, the other one will be affected negatively with X losing his \"X4\" armor and Zero losing his buster. There are four armors for X—his Ultimate Armor, the upgraded armor from \"Mega Man X4\", and two others that must be assembled from capsules. However, X cannot wear parts of these armors separately. X can also no longer shoot his buster through walls, and each character has the ability to duck. Zero is able to find and enter Dr. Light's capsules, however, he cannot use the armor parts given, instead retaining the part to bring to X. However, if Zero reaches the capsule that contains X's Ultimate Armor, Dr. Light will offer the \"Black Zero\" Armor instead of the Ultimate Armor that enhances his abilities. Besides regular enemies and bosses, X and Zero can be chased by a phantom virus that will try to infect the characters. If X is sufficiently infected by enough viruses, he will enter a state where his health rapidly declines. However, if Zero is sufficiently infected, he becomes briefly invincible, with increased attack power. At any point between levels, the player has the option of firing the Enigma at the Eurasia. If the Enigma misses, then the player has the option of launching the shuttle. Whether the crash is prevented or not is determined by random chance. If the crash is not prevented, the course of the story is changed. Due to the nature of the storyline, there are multiple endings. Whether X or Zero is used to defeat the last boss also affects which ending is seen.\n\n\"Mega Man X5\" was originally meant to be the last game of the \"Mega Man X\" series. As stated by producer Keiji Inafune, \"I had very little to do with \"X5\". I just told the team to 'finish off the series with this title,' and left it at that. That's why the game itself has a real feel of finality to it.\" However, Capcom decided to publish \"Mega Man X6\" the following year, in which Zero survived his fight from \"X5\", much to the dismay of Inafune. Haruki Suetsugu, an artist for \"Mega Man X4\", designed nearly all of the characters and promotional artwork for \"Mega Man X5\". Suetsugu added various details to set the characters apart from one another. X's new Falcon Armor was designed by Ryuji Higurashi, who wanted it to resemble a bird with beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the \"Inazuman\" manga series. The Maverick bosses in the English localization of \"Mega Man X5\" are named after members of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. Capcom voice actress Alyson Court, who was involved in the game's localization, came up with the new names as a tribute to her then-husband's love of the band. For the \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" release, the Maverick Bosses names were changed to translations of their original Japanese names.\n\nThe musical score for \"Mega Man X5\" was composed by Naoto Tanaka, Naoya Kamisaka, and Takuya Miyawaki. The Japanese version of \"Mega Man X5\" features one opening theme, \"Monkey\", and one closing theme, , both composed and performed by Showtaro Morikubo and his band Mosquito Milk. All of the game's instrumental and vocal music was compiled on the \"\" soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003. The theme songs were also included on the \"Rockman Theme Song Collection\", published by Suleputer in 2002.\n\n\"Mega Man X5\" was generally well-received, with IGN giving the game an 8.5 out of 10. However, they added that though the game was fun to play, it was \"more of the same\" from Capcom, and that \"Mega Man\", like many other series made by Capcom, was being milked for as much as it was worth. GameSpot similarly commented that \"Fans of the classic 2D games will no doubt find much to love in \"X5\", while those who can't get into the aging conventions and mechanics probably won't care a great deal for it.\" The \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" said that the game was \"unforgivably primitive\".\n\nAccording to the Japanese publication \"Famitsu\", \"Mega Man X5\" was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its release week at 46,033 copies sold. It placed at number eight the following week with an additional 22,963 copies sold. Media Create sales information showed that the game was 96th best-selling video game in Japan during 2000. Dengeki Online reported that \"Mega Man X5\" sold a total of 215,687 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, listing it as the 132nd best-selling game of the year in the region. The game was eventually re-released as part of Sony's PlayStation The Best for Family range of budget titles in Japan. Toy Retail Sales Tracking (TRST) sales data showed that \"Mega Man X5\" was the fifth best-selling PlayStation game in North America for the month of February 2001. The game was included on the North American \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2006.\n \n"}

Some local authorities have retained its branding, however.\n\nConnexions was formerly The Careers Service, which had its organisation altered throughout the Conservative government's privatisation process in the mid-1990s.\n\nDuring the period of Labour Government the Connexions service became increasingly focused on the delivery of targeted services to those who were often described as most in need of help.\n\nOne interesting initiative was the introduction of the Connexions Card.\n\nFollowing the 2010 election of the Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition the future of Connexions was called into question. Where Connexions was retained as a branding, it was a local decision, and there was considerable local divergence around branding and delivery. Government guidance from 2011 stated that \"There will be no expectation that local authorities should provide universal careers services once the new careers service is established.\" The new career service referred to is the National Careers Service, which was established on 1 April 2012.\n\nA 2010 research report by the National Youth Agency and the Local Government Association noted that some young people were unclear about the role and function of Connexions, although those who had interacted with the service were generally positive about it.\n\nThrough this process, funding that was originally given directly to local councils for the delivery of the service, was henceforth allocated directly by central government (via regional offices) to private careers companies. This meant the Labour government was more easily able to use funds previously allocated for careers services, for the creation of the Connexions service. The service was originally intended to be constituted by professionals from a range of backgrounds (careers advisers, youth workers, counsellors, health workers, teachers etc.). However, as the funding for these other professions lay within the control of local councils it was not as accessible. The result was that the careers service in England was abolished and replaced by Connexions, but it was made up predominantly of career guidance professionals and was not really the multi-disciplinary organisation originally envisaged. However, Connexions services typically worked closely with many other services, particularly those within local government, such as the Young Offenders Team (YOT), Teenage Pregnancy Workers, Children's Services, but also Housing Associations, Job Centres, and others.\n\nFrom 1 April 2008 responsibility for providing Connexions Services was transferred to local authorities in each area ( rather than the Connexions Partnerships). Some chose to take services in-house, others to commission services from other providers. The brand however, remained. As a result, there was very little in terms of uniformity. Berkshire Connexions, for example, was run differently, and structured differently, to Surrey or Oxfordshire Connexions.\n\nThere were 47 Connexions Partnerships throughout the country. These partnership offices managed the Connexions service on a local level, bringing together all the key youth support services in their area. The partnership offices managed the Connexions Centres in their locality.\n\nFollowing early public spending cuts under the Coalition Government Connexions services were badly hit. In many areas the service vanished altogether, whilst in others the service remained. Typically support for the NEET group has continued to be funded through the local authority, but the careers element of the Connexions service was eventually devolved to schools.\n\nPrincipally, Connexions offered an impartial, client-centred, careers, information and guidance service. The staff were known as \"Connexions Personal Advisers,\" and were trained to offer confidential advice and practical help relating to a wide range of issues. The concern was that the result was a professional that was a 'jack of all trades, master of none', with many ex-career guidance professionals in particular concerned that the increased remit of their role has been detrimental to their expertise and knowledge in matters of career guidance.\n\nA web site, Connexions Direct, offered information on various topics of potential interest to young people in England. Connexions also offered one-to-one support by telephone, SMS, and instant messaging.\n\nConsent was nominally sought prior to sharing information, such as school attendance records, unless there was a statutory or common law duty to do so. Such consent was not necessarily limited in scope, or length of time in effect. Consequently, confidentiality may not be guaranteed.\n\nInformation sharing powers were granted under sections 114 to 121 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and section 12 of the Children Act 2004.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2175376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175376", "title": "Mega Man X6", "text": "Mega Man X6\n\nMega Man X6, known as in Japan, is a video game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sixth main entry in the \"Mega Man X\" series. The game was first released on the PlayStation in Japan on November 29, 2001 and was later made available in both North America and Europe.\n\nThe plot of \"Mega Man X6\" takes place during the 22nd century where humans and intelligent robots called \"Reploids\" live together. The game follows shortly after the events of \"Mega Man X5\" in which planet Earth was devastated by an attack by the \"Maverick\" leader Sigma and the protagonist Zero sacrificed his own life to save it. As the world recovers, a Maverick known only as the \"Zero Nightmare\" has begun spreading chaos. Zero's comrade X, curious of its name, seeks out this new threat. Like past games in the series, \"Mega Man X6\" is an action-platformer in which the player tackles a series of stages and adds the unique weapon of each boss to X's arsenal.\n\nProminent series artist and producer Keiji Inafune was not involved in the game's production, as he had intended the fifth installment in the series to be the last with Zero's death. Critically, \"Mega Man X6\" has received mixed to positive reviews. The game was released for the Microsoft Windows in different parts of Asia in 2002 and 2003. It was also re-released in 2006 as part of the North American \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. \"Mega Man X6\" was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line on July 8, 2015 in Japan. It was released for the Windows internationally, along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as a part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" (\"Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2\" in Japan) on July 24, 2018 and July 26, 2018 for Japan.\n\nThree weeks have passed since the events of \"Mega Man X5\". Zero is missing, presumed dead. As a result of the Eurasia space colony incident, Earth's surface has been rendered uninhabitable, forcing the human population to take refuge underground. An intelligent Reploid researcher, Gate, is searching through the ruins of Eurasia and finds something unusual. A week later, Gate goes mad as he completes an experiment, and declares his intentions to turn Earth into a utopia for high-class Reploids.\n\nMeanwhile, X is awakened by Alia after a dream involving Zero, and she informs him of a large Maverick near Eurasia. He briefly encounters a being reminiscent to Zero, although the being appears distorted and discolored. X then meets a scientist named Isoc and his subordinate, High Max, who are in the search of the Zero-like being, which they identify as the \"Zero Nightmare\". Isoc invites all Reploids to join his cause to destroy the Nightmare phenomena, which is turning the Reploid population into Mavericks. However, this is revealed to be a ruse to lure Reploids to areas affected by the Nightmare, where they will become Mavericks under Gate's control.\n\nX journeys to the suspected areas to investigate the Nightmare phenomena and rescue the Reploids who volunteered to help. He learns that Isoc's eight investigators have been infected by the Nightmare and become Mavericks. During his battles, X can also encounter the Zero Nightmare and defeat him. Following this, the real Zero appears, unaware of how he survived his battle against Sigma. Nonetheless, he reunites with X, and rejoins the Maverick Hunters to continue investigating the Nightmare.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the eight investigators (or High Max), X and Zero meet Gate, who reveals he found a piece of Zero's DNA at the Eurasia crash site. The DNA drove Gate insane, and he created the Nightmare phenomena alongside the Zero Nightmare to help build his utopia.\n\nThe Hunters go to Gate's laboratory to put to a stop to his plans. Following Gate's defeat, he confesses he has rebuilt Sigma, and was using him as a trump card, but Sigma is a shell of his former self: a partially coherent, half-built body, with his programming still severely damaged. However, Sigma has enough strength to nearly kill Gate, and challenges X and Zero. With his sanity slipping, Sigma is once again defeated and one of three endings will occur, depending on which character defeats Sigma:\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to \"Mega Man X5\". The player can select X with the option to outfit him with different armors offering unique abilities (most of which have to be downloaded, as always, through Dr. Light's hidden capsules.) Zero can be unlocked after finding and defeating the Zero Nightmare, bringing his own weapons and techniques to the fold, including a refined Z-Saber fighting style. Both characters can be equipped with various power-up items earned after rescuing certain Reploids.\n\n\"Mega Man X6\" has an increased emphasis on rescuing Reploids over previous titles in the series. Whereas previous games rewarded the player with health or an extra life, \"Mega Man X6\" rewards the player with additional parts or other permanent prizes. Rescuing Reploids was made more difficult in this game with the addition of the Nightmare, which makes any Reploid it infects evil, thus rendering the Reploid impossible to save. The parts system was altered as well. Rather than attach a certain part to a certain armor, parts are attached to the character itself. The number of parts that can be equipped at once is dependent on the player's rank, which is increased by harvesting Nightmare Souls.\n\nDepending on the player's actions during the game, it's possible to unlock what are normally the final set of stages, namely Gate's laboratory, much earlier than normal than what is considered the norm for the X series; with the exception of \"Mega Man X5\", players normally had to defeat the 8 main bosses before unlocking the final stages. In \"X6\", defeating both the Zero Nightmare and High Max, Isoc's bodyguard, are enough to unlock Gate's laboratory before even defeating most of the main bosses.\n\nSeries producer Keiji Inafune was not involved in the development of \"Mega Man X6\". He had originally intended for the fifth chapter in the series to be the last due to the death of Zero at that game's conclusion. \"And so I’d always planned to make Zero come back to life in the Mega Man Zero series, but then \"X6\" comes out sooner from another division and Zero comes back to life in that, and I’m like, 'What's this!? Now my story for Zero doesn’t make sense! Zero's been brought back to life two times!'\" Inafune also felt he owed fans of the series an apology for the decision to create \"Mega Man X6\", although the series was \"starting to go in a direction out of <nowiki>[his]</nowiki> control\" at that point. Artist Haruki Suetsugu, who had worked on both previous PlayStation \"Mega Man X\" games, signed on as the game's primary character designer and promotional artwork illustrator. Suetsugu stated that the development schedule of \"Mega Man X6\" was tight. As such, he described his designs for the Maverick bosses were \"relatively simple\", and he took a similar approach to designing all of them: for instance, all of the Mavericks have the characteristic head fins and forehead jewel found on their creator Gate's helmet. The designs for other characters also feature unique traits, including Gate as a \"merging of scientists and combatants, High Max as \"big and strong\", and the DNA-like Nightmare.\n\nThe background music for \"Mega Man X6\" was composed by Naoto Tanaka. The game also features the opening vocal songs \"Moon Light\" and \"The Answer\" by Showtaro Morikubo (the voice actor for X) and the ending theme \"I.D.E.A\" by RoST. This is one of the few X games to have the opening song appear in both the Japanese and English versions. All of the game's instrumental and vocal music was compiled on the \"Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6\" soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.\nThe game was not dubbed in any language other than the original Japanese, and the North American and European versions retained the Japanese voice tracks, using translated English subtitles to tell the story. The voice tracks for the cutscenes were removed completely when Mega Man X6 was re-released as a part of Mega Man X Collection for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube in North America in 2006, though the in-game voice tracks are still retained.\n\nAccording to the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\", \"Mega Man X6\" was the seventh best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 39,318 units sold. Dengeki Online reported that \"Mega Man X6\" sold a total of 106,980 units in Japan by the end of 2001, marking it as the 109th best-selling game of the year in the region. The game eventually saw a re-release as part of the PlayStation the Best range of budget titles. \"Mega Man X6\" was also included on the North American \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2006.\n\n\"Mega Man X6\" received mixed to positive reviews, with an average score of 69% on GameRankings. GameSpot gave the game a 7 out of 10, saying that the game is \"a disappointing effort. The nightmare system and item collecting add variety and longevity to the game, but... The graphics aren't really even up to the standards set by older games in the series, and while the music is good, there aren't any tracks that particularly stand out. Despite these shortcomings, it's still Mega Man, and the gameplay is still entertaining, making X6 an attractive package for hard-core Mega Man fans.\" IGN gave a more positive review, an 8 out 10, stating \"It's an all-new Mega Man game, yet it's still pretty much the same. There's nothing wrong with that\"; they praised the soundtrack and replay value. Among the most negative reviews, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the game a 3.5 out of 10, saying \"I thought I’d sooner see Sasquatch ride a Chimera bareback through the streets than a bland series like Mega Man X last through six installments.\"\n\nIn retrospective, 1UP.com referred to \"Mega Man X6\" as \"sloppy\" citing multiple issues within its design such as repetitive stages and background images.\n\n"}

Founded in 1871 as Onondaga Pottery Company (O.P. Co.) in the town of Geddes, the company initially produced earthenware; in the late 19th century, O.P.Co., began producing fine china, for which it found a strong market particularly in hotels, restaurants, and railroad dining cars. The company closed in 2009.\n\nIn 1841, W. H. Farrar started a small pottery business in the town of Geddes, New York. Seventeen years later he moved the business to the location of what would become the Onondaga Pottery Company and eventually Syracuse China. Mr. Farrar produced whiskey jugs, butter crocks and mixing bowls in stoneware. A few years later the Empire Pottery company was organized to take over the Farrar Pottery. A line of \"white ware\" for table use was added. Like most pottery of the time it was susceptible to \"crazing\" - small cracks in the glazed surface. The company struggled along until 1871 at which time Onondaga Pottery Company was organized and took over.\n\nPopular taste demanded a finer ceramic tableware than the heavy pottery made by these companies. Onondaga Pottery started producing a heavy earthen ware called \"Ironstone\" but struggle to succeed. In 1873, they began manufacturing a \"white granite ware\" and then in 1885 a semi-vitreous ware. A year later they replaced this with a high fired china and a guarantee that the glaze would not crackle or craze - the first time an American-made tableware carried such a warranty. It was at this point, 45 years after the start of pottery production in Syracuse that the pottery business showed a stable and profitable prospect.\n\nUnder President James Pass, O.P.Co. developed a new china body and won the medal for translucent china at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. In 1897 production turned to the vitreous china body. Its first colored china body, \"Old Ivory,\" appeared in 1926. The company thrived with its hotel and railroad sales. The narrow-bodied \"Econo-Rim\" was tailored for the cramped table space of dining cars. Highly sought after collectible patterns sell regularly on eBay and at estate sales. The company was renowned for its fine china designs until 1970 when it limited its production to mostly restaurant dinnerware.\n\nOn April 9, 2009, after 138 years of production, the Syracuse China factory was shut down by Libbey, Inc. of Toledo Ohio, and all production of Syracuse China moved from North America. At that time, the plant had 275 employees. \n\nOn the last day of production, each employee was given a commemorative plate with a montage of images from throughout the company's history and eight of the company logos used over the course of the company's history. The face of the plate states, \"Though the world may change around us, our history remains the same.\" \n\nThe back of each plate was stamped \"38-A,\" the last date stamp to appear on a Syracuse China product made in Syracuse. The \"38\" is code for the year it was made (1971, the company's centennial year, plus 38 years). The \"A\" stands for the first quarter of the year. The back of each plate also has text indicating it was one of the last \"pieces to be made in Syracuse, N.Y.\"\n\nThe archives and china collections were donated to the Onondaga Historical Association.\n\nSyracuse China sponsored the Turner-Over Club (later the Turn-Over Club) as a promotion for decades. The company gave out membership cards, with the idea that wherever members traveled, they would \"turn over\" their dinnerware to see if it was Syracuse China; witnesses to this curious behavior would then be treated to the story of the club and thus introduced to the brand name.\n\n\n"}

Her family walked from their village in Tigray to Mek'ele in hopes of finding food or relief. The harsh journey proved too much for many: her sister Azmara died during the trip; she and her mother both became very ill.\n\nWhile at the aid center her father, Woldu Menameno, was told by the attending nuns that his daughter Birhan, would likely die within the next fifteen minutes. Her father, preparing for the worst, wrapped her in a white burial shroud, and began to dig a grave. However, as he began to bury his daughter, he noticed a faint pulse.

It is the seventh main game in the \"Mega Man X\" series and the first in the series to appear on the sixth generation of gaming consoles. \"Mega Man X7\" was first released in Japan on July 17, 2003, with North American and European releases following in October 2003 and March 2004 respectively. It was also released for Microsoft Windows exclusively in South Korea until the re-release as part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" (\"Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2\" in Japan) in July 24 2018 for the worldwide release and July 26, 2018 for Japan, whose Windows version was released internationally via Steam along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. It is the first \"Mega Man X\" in the series to feature bilingual audio. The next game in the series, \"Mega Man X8\", also features bilingual audio. It is the first and only \"Mega Man X\" game to be a third-person shooter (as well as the third \"Mega Man\" game to use third-person view due to the \"Mega Man Legends\" franchise).\n\n\"Mega Man X7\" takes place in the 22nd century. Daily human life is often disrupted by \"Maverick\" crime from the \"Reploids\" robots that live and work among them. The heroic \"Maverick Hunter\" Mega Man X has retired from the battlefield. As such, various groups have begun springing up to stamp out the ever constant threat of Maverick activity. Axl, a member of \"Red Alert\", questions his group's methods and deserts the team, only to be pursued by its leader, Red. Like other games in the series, \"Mega Man X7\" is an action-platform game in which the player fights through an octet of selectable stages. The game differs from previous side-scrolling entries by featuring fully 3D graphics intermixed with both 3D and 2D gameplay.\n\nThe development of \"Mega Man X7\" involved a challenging transition of the well-known \"Mega Man X\" characters into 3D. However, the reinvention of the series in both graphical and gameplay respects was met with a hostile critical reception. Reviewers found the game's foray into the third dimension well-intended but poorly executed.\n\nFollowing the Eurasia and Nightmare incidents, Reploids work diligently to rebuild the Earth. Growing weary of the seemingly never-ending Maverick Wars, X decides to retire in search of more peaceful solutions, leaving Zero in charge. In X's absence, Maverick activity rapidly begins to rise, which leads to the formation of an unsanctioned anti-Maverick vigilante group known as Red Alert. As the group grows more and more reckless, one of their members, a new generation Reploid prototype named Axl, decides to defect. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting them, and goes on a rampage to get him back.\n\nAxl is chased through a city by a mechaniloid sent by Red Alert to retrieve him, and the ensuing chaos draws the attention of Zero. After a battle against the mechaniloid, Zero takes Axl into custody at Maverick Hunter HQ. In response, Red issues a challenge to the Hunters: he will release some Mavericks that Red Alert has in captivity, and whichever group can defeat the Mavericks first will gain possession of Axl. Zero goes into action without hesitation, and Axl's remorse for what he has done fuels his desire to become a Maverick Hunter. As Zero and Axl battle Red Alert, Axl reveals that he possesses the ability to copy the DNA of other Reploids, making him invaluable to Red. X initially stays out of the conflict, feeling that it is pointless, but later joins in hoping to end the war quickly. Elsewhere, Red communicates with a mysterious figure known as \"The Professor,\" who gives him additional power and shows him what Axl's copy ability can do. The Professor then takes possession of Red Alert, and orders Red to retrieve Axl.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Mavericks, the Hunters infiltrate Crimson Palace, the home base of Red Alert. There they defeat a reluctant Red and discover a rebuilt Sigma, who was behind Red Alert's corruption. Despite the Hunters defeating Sigma twice, he rises once again and punches Axl through a wall, before vowing to X and Zero that he will again return. Suddenly, Red reappears and Sigma attempts to possess him, but it turns out to be Axl (copying Red's DNA), who then proceeds to blast Sigma out of a window from the top of the palace.\n\nThe ending of the game depends on which character was used to defeat Sigma:\n\n\"Mega Man X7\" is the first of the two games in the series to have 3D gameplay in addition to the standard 2D style. When starting the game, the player has only access to returning Maverick Hunter Zero and newcomer Axl. The player can send the two characters to the same stage and both can be changed whenever the player needs to. In order to unlock X, the player must rescue 64 reploids (out of a possible total of 128) or defeat the eight main bosses in order to unlock him. Unlike the prequel, chips must be used immediately after they are gained and cannot be deactivated, nor changed from one playable character to another. Once all the chips for that playable character are completely maxed out, that particular character can no longer receive anymore chip upgrades.\n\nWhile Zero and X retain their common weaponry, Axl has a new ability called \"Copy Shot\". If the player destroys certain types of enemies with said technique, they will leave an item upon their destruction. If the item (a glowing red sphere) is picked up, Axl will transform into a copy of the enemy he destroyed, with all of its features (speed, weapon, etc.).\n\nThe game also has a New Game Plus feature, by completing the game and saving it, and then starting a new game from loading that particular save file. This feature allows for X to become available after the opening stage and all the chip upgrades from the previous game are retained.\n\n\"Mega Man X7\" was developed by a team of about 30 people, led by producers Tatsuya Minami and Tatsuya Kitabayashi of Capcom Production Studio 3. This was the first game in the \"Mega Man\" series worked on by Kitabayashi. He explained that transitioning the character models of \"Mega Man X\" from 2D to 3D graphics was a challenge, but that including both 2D and 3D gameplay was not, as they had planned to have them in equal amounts for the game. The development team took into account the less-than-favorable reception for \"Mega Man X6\", but instead of simply trying to make the next game new and fresh with 3D graphics, they decided to focus on \"getting 3D right\". The team also attempted to build upon the action-style gameplay for which the \"Mega Man\" franchise is known along with the more adult-themed storyline of the \"Mega Man X\" series. This involved adding the newer, non-traditional character Axl to deepen and better the narrative. Kitabayashi emphasized, \"He's young, he's running away. He's like the new younger character of the group, and that's why I wanted to put him in there.\" Minami stated in an interview that the game would feature multiplayer for up to two players. However, the final version of the game lacks this option.\n\nProminent \"Mega Man\" artist and Capcom producer Keiji Inafune had little involvement in the \"Mega Man X\" series after the fifth installment. His only contribution to \"Mega Man X7\" was lending advice to the illustrators on creating the new protagonist Axl. Inafune had been careful to make X and Zero unique when he originally designed them, and he wanted to give Axl the same treatment. The game's primary artist, Tatsuya Yoshikawa, signed on when the project was well underway. He decided to take after his predecessor Haruki Suetsugu for the direction in which to design the characters. Yoshikawa thought the team would have to create \"polygon friendly\" bosses, but decided to stick to the traditional design concepts set forth by the early \"Mega Man X\" games. As the series had finally transition into 3D, Yoshikawa also expected the team to rethink the way the game was made as they had done in the first \"Mega Man X\" title. Inafune stated, \"My personal opinion was that 3D is simply a graphical style, and just because a game is going 3D like \"X7\" was, it doesn't mean we 'have to' make it a 3D game.\n\nThe musical score for \"Mega Man X7\" was composed by nine individuals. A 46-song soundtrack was released by Suleputer in Japan on October 1, 2003. The game's opening theme, \"Code Crush\", is performed by Rina Aiuchi. The ending theme is \"Lazy Mind\", performed by Showtaro Morikubo, the voice actor for X in the Japanese games. A CD single for each of the songs was released in Japan on July 20, 2003 and August 6, 2003 respectively.\n\n\"Mega Man X7\" debuted on Japanese sales charts as the third best-selling video game at copies. By its second week on sale, the game had sold 71,739 copies in the region and by its third week, 89,775 copies. Media Create sales data lists the game as having sold 111,778 copies by the end of 2003 in Japan. A budget re-release of the game was included alongside the PlayStation versions of the first six original \"Mega Man\" games as part of the \"Rockman Collection\" in Japan on December 19, 2003.\n\n\"Mega Man X7\" received mixed to negative reviews. While it attracted some positive remarks for the character switching and Reploid rescue systems, the general consensus was that the game's mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay was well-intentioned but poorly executed. IGN found the characters unbalanced as the shooters X and Axl felt far more useful than the melee fighter Zero. In particular, critics commented that the camera and controls do not translate well from 2D to 3D. Criticism has been aimed at the English voice actors' performance, to the point that it has been recommended to try listening to the original Japanese audio. The music has been described as generic and, while appealing, it does not stand out against what previous installments have offered.\n\nGameSpy concluded \"I can't fault Capcom or the \"MMX7\" team for trying to reinvent a series that had obviously completely lost its way... [but] the flaccid 2D sections in this game aren't half as good as any of the levels in the original \"Mega Man X\". The 3D bits are more compelling, but still substandard.\" IGN instead placed the blame wholly on the 3D sections: \"We can't help but think that \"Mega Man X7\" would have been better-suited staying 2D. But until Capcom realizes that the better action-oriented 3D titles allow you to manipulate the camera whole-heartedly, future installments of the series will likely run into the same problems that this one did.\"\n\nIn a retrospective article involving the franchise's worst games, 1UP.com included \"Mega Man X7\" citing \"usual 3D design issues\" and the titular character requiring to be unlocked as the game's flaws. GamesRadar compared it with the similarly poor received \"Castlevania\" for the Nintendo 64 due to how both games tried staying away from their predecessors' formula by adding 3D gameplay and the transition failed to gamers.\n"}
{"id": "2175382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175382", "title": "Mega Man X8", "text": "Mega Man X8\n\nMega Man X8, known as in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Sony PlayStation 2 console. It is the eighth and, to date, final game in the \"Mega Man X\" series (excluding spin-offs and remakes). It was first released in North America on December 7, 2004. The PS2 version, as well as a Microsoft Windows iteration, were released in Japan and Europe the following year. On December 16, 2015 it was released on PlayStation Network in Japan. It was re-released for Windows via Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan as a part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" (\"Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2\" in Japan).\n\nThe plot of \"Mega Man X8\" focuses on the abduction of a next-generation \"Reploid\", Lumine from the construction site of a space elevator, and the subsequent pursuit of his captors. During the course of game play the motivations of these captors comes into focus, and it is up to the heroes, led by X, to stop them. The gameplay of \"Mega Man X8\" is similar to the other games in the series, in which the player must complete a series of stages. Defeating their bosses will earn that player character its special weapon which differs between each character.\n\nAlthough \"Mega Man X8\" uses 3D graphics like \"Mega Man X7\", the development team chose not to opt for 3D gameplay, instead opting for 2.5D gameplay. The game was met with a mixed to average reception.\n\nIn late 21XX, the Maverick Wars continue with no end in sight. To escape the carnage, humans have begun migrating to the Moon as part of an initiative known as the \"Jakob Project\", which involves an orbital elevator built in the Galapagos Islands. One night while X is out on patrol, one of the elevators breaks off and comes crashing down to Earth. As X approaches the elevator, the doors open, revealing an entire army of Sigmas. Suddenly, a purple-haired Reploid arrives and introduces himself as Lumine, the director of the Jakob Project. He reveals the \"Sigma army\" isn't what it appears to be; instead, they are new generation Reploids created as part of the project who are immune from viruses and able to use DNA copy data to change their shapes and appearances to assist with space development.\n\nEverything seems to be running smoothly until Vile, who was last seen in \"Mega Man X3\", returns and kidnaps Lumine, causing Maverick uprisings all over the world. While battling the Mavericks, the Hunters pick up hints that Sigma has returned and teasing a concept called \"the new world\". Eventually, Sigma is tracked to the Moon, where he unveils his ultimate plan: eradicate the \"old generation\" and re-populate it with his \"children\". He reveals all of the new generation Reploids contain a copy chip which possesses his DNA, meaning these 'virus-proof' Reploids are essentially copies of Sigma.\n\nWhen Sigma is defeated, Lumine emerges from the shadows and congratulates the Hunters on finally destroying Sigma once and for all, before admitting he was manipulating Sigma in order to get his DNA and is behind the entire plot. Lumine gloats to the stunned Hunters that in order for evolution to take its course, he and the new generation Reploids must destroy both the humans and \"obsolete\" Reploids. After a massive struggle, Lumine is defeated, but he warns them that it is too late to stop what has already begun. As Axl approaches Lumine's body, a tentacle springs from it and breaks the crystal on his helmet, knocking him unconscious.\n\nThe ending of the game varies slightly depending on which character defeats Lumine. As the Hunters ride back down the orbital elevator, Zero wonders if he no longer has to fight now that Sigma is dead for good, while X ponders Lumine's words on evolution. Zero tells X not to let his words get to him, as new generation Reploids becoming Sigma could hardly be called evolution. Furthermore, he tells X that even if they are destined to join the scrap heap when that evolution does comes about, they'll still have to fight, not only against the Mavericks, but against their own destinies as well. \n\nA post-credits scene explains that the news of Lumine turning Maverick resulted in ceasing production of DNA copy chips. However, due to the increasing need of advanced Reploids for space development, production resumed several years later, despite the objections of many. Meanwhile, as the Hunters continue to descend the orbital elevator, a faint purple light emits from Axl's shattered helmet crystal, suggesting that Lumine's spirit lives on.\n\nOverall gameplay in \"Mega Man X8\" is mostly similar to previous \"Mega Man X\" games and has removed the 3D style from \"Mega Man X7\" in favor of a 2.5D style, although two of the stages, namely \"Central White\" and \"Dynasty\", are fully 3D, played aboard a vehicle with a close third-person view. After an introductory stage, \"Mega Man X8\" presents the player with a choice of 8 stages, with a Maverick robot serving as the stage boss. After defeating the 8 bosses, a series of fortress stages open up for the player to complete in linear progression until the final boss is defeated. This game also has an option of three difficulty modes, with slight differences between each mode. Normal or hard mode is recommended if players want to observe the ending and fight the \"real\" final boss.\n\nThe player starts the game with access to three playable characters: X, a shooter able to wear multiple armors that can be mixed and matched which opens up possibilities for customizing x's abilities, Axl, a shooter able to transform into enemies and fire in any direction; and Zero, a sword fighter able to double jump. Additionally, Zero can equip additional weapons that can be purchased as chips at the store such as hammers, fans and additional swords after finding a certain rare metal for it, excluding one of the weapons which is only available for purchase upon completing the game with Zero or entering a code in the title screen of the PlayStation 2 and \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" versions. Axl's gameplay had been slightly reworked to make him more different from X, such as gaining the ability to acquire new guns after defeating each boss, instead of gaining their weapon and can fire in any direction. \"X8\" introduces new mechanics to the game; the first is Guard Break, which can break enemy defenses when enemies are attacked with certain weapons. The second is Double Attack, where the playable character and the chosen partner character perform a screen-filling attack that causes heavy damage to all enemies on screen. Additionally, X's new armor, the Neutral Armor, can be customized with parts that can either form two new armors the Icarus or Hermes armor, or mixed together for different effects. However, mixed parts of armors are not as effective as complete armors which lack the Giga attack ability, forcing players to choose wisely when building armors.\n\nTwo characters can be selected to go to a stage, while a navigator can be assigned to assist the player. Depending on the navigator's qualities, the character will be informed about the stages' hidden paths or boss weaknesses. In every stage, the characters can obtain items that can be used in a shop to buy upgrades. The three navigators can also be unlocked as the playable characters by buying chips after completing the game in the Normal or Hard levels or entering the code in the title screen of the PlayStation 2 version and later \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" re-release.\n\nMuch like with \"X7\", this game is also equipped with New Game Plus features, which allow players to start a new game from an old save file upon completion of the previous game. Aside from the aforementioned unlockable features, all chips that were purchased in the store during the previous game are retained. Players also have the option of starting fresh by deleting any of these chips and repurchasing them later.\n\n\"Mega Man X8\" was developed by Capcom Production Studio 1. The game's direct predecessor, \"Mega Man X7\", was the first entry in the \"Mega Man X\" series to feature full 3D graphics, as well as 3D gameplay. However, as stated by Capcom producer and original \"Mega Man\" illustrator Keiji Inafune, the development team chose not to pursue 3D gameplay for \"Mega Man X8\" simply because of its graphical style. Inafune himself was not involved in the production of \"Mega Man X8\", although the game's art designers did consult with him before changing the overall style of the characters. The game's main illustrator, Tatsuya Yoshikawa, was responsible for designing the protagonists, the Maverick bosses, and the newer ancillary cast. Yoshikawa took into account what the characters may resemble if they were toys, and even imitated the joints of Revoltech figures.\n\nThe musical score for \"Mega Man X8\" was co-composed by Yuko Komiyama, Naoto Tanaka, and Shinya Okada. The 51-song \"Rockman X8 Original Soundtrack\" was released in Japan on April 13, 2005 by Suleputer. The Japanese opening theme for PlayStation 2 (also available for PC platform in any regional version, including Europe which had received the North American opening theme in the European PlayStation 2 version) is \"Wild Fang\" by Janne Da Arc; the band had previously done television advertisement themes for \"Mega Man Battle Network\" and \"Mega Man Battle Network 2\". However, the theme was not included in the soundtrack and was even omitted on the game's localization in English for PS2 platform.\nA Windows version of \"Mega Man X8\" was released in Asia, Europe, and as a download from GameStop in North America. This version can run in windowed mode, in addition to , and includes mouse and keyboard features, although it does support using a controller. The Windows version also features several languages and the possibility to toggle between Japanese and English voices, which can be changed from the main menu or after starting a new game. All of the music and cutscene dialogue is encoded in Ogg Vorbis format.\n\n\"Mega Man X8\" received a generally mixed to average reception. It was generally praised for returning to a more classic style of Mega Man gameplay and removing the criticized gameplay elements of \"Mega Man X7\". IGN praised the game for its mixture of 2D and 3D, and its camera system, saying \"Thankfully the transition from one plane to another is pretty seamless and isn't the bothersome chore that switches in X7 were. It's an easy and totally acceptable gameplay method and one that should have been used in 2003 to begin with.\" On the other hand, GameSpot criticized the game for its level design, which often made the game extremely frustrating to play. They also derided the story, remarking that it \"dabbles in a lot of nonsensical anime-style ramblings about things that are of little importance to the actual game.\"\n\nAccording to \"Famitsu\", \"Mega Man X8\" was the tenth best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 14,927 units. A total of 35,546 units were sold in the region by the end of 2005.\n\n"}

Indeed, the only young people to use the cards were those who didn't have a problem in the first place.

{"id": "2175391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175391", "title": "Mega Man Battle Network (video game)", "text": "Mega Man Battle Network (video game)\n\nMega Man Battle Network is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld console. It is the first title of the \"Mega Man Battle Network\" series of games. It was originally released in Japan as a GBA launch game on March 21, 2001 and was released later that year in North America and Europe. It was also released via the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on July 9, 2014, in Europe on July 24, 2014, and in North America on July 31, 2014.\n\n\"Battle Network\" takes place during the 21st century in a world where society and everyday life is driven by the internet. Users are able to interact with and virtually explore nearly any electronic device using highly advanced, online avatars called \"NetNavis\". The game follows a young boy named Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE as they solve a series of crimes instigated by the \"WWW (World Three)\" organization. Rather than share the platform gameplay of its predecessors, \"Battle Network\" is a tactical role-playing game (RPG) in which the player respectively controls Lan in the game's outside world and MegaMan.EXE in its virtual world. Battles take place in real-time; special abilities called \"Battle Chips\" can be accessed to fight off the numerous computer viruses present in the game's cyberspace environments.\n\n\"Battle Network\" was created amidst the rise of collectible card games, as shown by its collectible Battle Chips that are used to create \"Folders\" (like card decks). According to producer Keiji Inafune, the development team wanted \"Battle Network\" to identify specifically with younger gamers by creating a setting resembling the real world and a gameplay model that mixes traditional action and RPG elements. \"Battle Network\" received positive reviews from critics. Its unconventional combat system was given significant praise and its presentation was well-regarded. However, its storyline was met with mixed opinions. The game was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off titles, as well as other media.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Network\" is set in an ambiguous year in the 21st century (\"20XX AD\") in an alternate reality to the original \"Mega Man\" series. Within the world of \"Battle Network\", the Net has become humanity's primary means of communication, commerce, and even crime. Users are able to \"jack in\" to the Net and other computerized devices, and explore their various aspects using program avatars called \"NetNavis (Network Navigators)\" as if they were physical locations. The Net and the inner workings of computers are displayed as a virtual world with which computer programs of all varieties, as personified in a humanoid form, can interact. Users often do so by accessing their NetNavis via a \"PET (PErsonal information Terminal)\" device. The plot of \"Mega Man Battle Network\" follows one such pair, Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. Lan is a fifth grader in the town of ACDC. His father, Dr. Yuichiro Hikari, is one of the world's top scientists and NetNavi researchers. Not long into the story, Lan and MegaMan.EXE take it upon themselves to solve various criminal cases around ACDC involving other Navis and their operators. Some of the confrontations with the various criminals involve desperate, life-threatening situations including a bus rigged to explode, oxygen being cut off at a large party, the entire city's clean water freezing, and school students being re-educated as mindless slaves. The duo continuously crosses paths with Eugene Chaud, an official \"NetBattler\" commissioned by the government to investigate crimes on the Net. Chaud and his NetNavi ProtoMan.EXE act as rivals to Lan and MegaMan.EXE.\n\nThe protagonists eventually learn that the criminals are all connected to an organization called the \"WWW (World Three)\". The WWW intentionally infects computer networks with computer viruses so as to hinder their normal operations and hack vital information. The group is led by Dr. Wily, a former colleague of Lan's grandfather. While working together, Wily had specialized in robotics while Lan's grandfather specialized in networks, which eventually led to NetNavis. The government cut Wily's funding, opting instead to pursue Hikari's NetNavi project. Wily's goal throughout the game is to collect four super programs with which the \"LifeVirus\" may be constructed. The LifeVirus is a nearly indestructible virus capable of wiping out the Net and all associated devices. The protagonists infiltrate the WWW, but MegaMan.EXE becomes disabled. Chaud arrives and gives Lan a batch file from Dr. Hikari to restore his Navi. After receiving the file \"Hub.bat\", Lan questions his father about the name. It is revealed the MegaMan.EXE is actually a unique Navi made by Lan's father. When Lan's twin brother, Hub, died at a young age, Dr. Hikari transferred Hub's consciousness into the NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. This created a special physical and virtual bond between the two brothers. In the end, Lan and MegaMan.EXE manage to defeat Wily, destroy the LifeVirus, and restore peace to ACDC.\n\nUnlike the previous action-platformer entries of the \"Mega Man\" franchise, \"Mega Man Battle Network\" is a real-time tactical RPG. To progress through the game the player must alternately navigate the outside world as Lan Hikari and the Net as MegaMan.EXE, each containing certain tasks that must be completed to allow advancement in the other. Controlling Lan, the player may travel around the world map, interact with non-player characters, check email, purchase items, initiate Net missions, or speak with MegaMan.EXE through his PET. In contrast with traditional \"Mega Man\" entries in which battle and movement through the levels happen in the same setting, \"Battle Network\"s combat occurs only through by battling computer viruses within the Net. This cyber world is represented by a series of branching pathways and nodes, where MegaMan.EXE can travel to both new and previously visited locations, find and purchase items, and fight viruses. Battles do not generally appear on the field screen of the Net but are usually set as random encounters. The battlefield itself is made up of 18 tiles divided into two groups of nine, one group being space in which MegaMan.EXE may freely move and the other group being space inhabited by enemies. Akin to other \"Mega Man\" games, MegaMan.EXE possesses an arm cannon called the \"Mega Buster\". The player can transition among the nine provided tiles and fire the Mega Buster at enemies from across the screen. The objective of each battle is to delete all the viruses by reducing their hit points (HP) to zero. If MegaMan.EXE's own health depletes, a game over occurs. Certain power-up programs can be found that upgrade MegaMan.EXE's HP, defense, or Mega Buster power.\n\nThe Mega Buster is quite weak on its own, so in order to delete viruses more efficiently, the player must access special abilities called \"Battle Chips\". These are minor programs that contain data that the Navi can utilize to perform more powerful attacks, summon other Navis for help, or execute supportive actions such as restoring HP or destroying tiles on the enemies' side of the battlefield. Battle Chips are uploaded to MegaMan.EXE by Lan's PET in a process called \"Customization.\" Each turn in battle presents the player with five random chips from which to choose, though the player is limited to chips of the same variety or chips with the same alphabetic code. Once the \"Battle Gauge\" (or \"Custom Gauge\") at the top of the screen fills during battle, another random set of chips can be chosen from a general pool called the \"folder\". At any given time, the player may only have exactly 30 chips in the folder from which the Customization process may draw. The player is only allowed to carry up to ten of the same kind of chip and up to five Navi-summon chips in the folder. However, a player may possess any number of other chips in inactive reserve, called the \"sack\", which may be moved to the active folder outside of battle. Every chip and enemy is aligned to one of five elements: Neutral, Fire, Water, Electric, and Wood. If MegaMan.EXE hits an enemy with an attack aligned to an element they are weak against, the attack will do double damage.\n\n\"Battle Network\" features a very limited multiplayer option. Up to two players may connect with each other using a Game Link Cable and then give or trade Battle Chips. Players may also engage in battles with one another. The \"test battle\" mode has no stakes whereas the \"real battle\" mode allows the winning player to take a battle chip from the loser.\n\nInitially conceptualized with the intention of being a horror game, \"Mega Man Battle Network\" was developed by Capcom Production Studio 2 amidst the success of Nintendo's portable RPG franchise \"Pokémon\". Rather than extend upon the traditional action-platform formula for the \"Mega Man\" series as they had done with the 3D \"Mega Man Legends\", Capcom followed Nintendo's example on the latter's then-newest handheld console, the GBA. While creating \"Battle Network\", director Masahiro Yasuma found difficulty in blending action attributes with \"the kind of fun you get from a \"Pokémon\" game\" in order to make it enjoyable, new, and fresh. Yasuma recalled that production was further challenged because no effective precursor of its type had been made before. Producer Keiji Inafune stated that the development team wanted to add a \"real world\" feel to the \"Mega Man\" series by placing the protagonist of \"Battle Network\" in a location where the internet is prevalent. With the release of the portable GBA, the team felt that they should target modern gamers, specifically children, as an audience for the new series. The developers thought such a theme would be both successful and relevant because these younger gamers grew up with and utilized such technology on a daily basis. To ensure the game's popularity, Capcom marketed \"Battle Network\" alongside an afternoon anime adaptation, emphasized head-to-head matches between players, and provided fans with exclusive content via special events.\n\nInafune credited himself for redesigning the protagonist Mega Man as MegaMan.EXE for the \"Battle Network\" series, though he recounted the character designers were reluctant to hand over the responsibility to him and even altered his illustrations afterwards. The character's initial concept art went through a large number of changes before it was finalized to a much simpler design, so that even very young fans could easily draw it. Yuji Ishihara acted as a primary character artist for the game. Each of the game's boss characters was designed so that their bodies would exude a certain motif; for example, StoneMan.EXE was meant to look like a huge castle made from stone masonry. Some bosses resembled their original \"Mega Man\" series counterparts while others were a large departure from these more humanoid appearances. Ishihara explained that the artists chose size and shape variety among the characters to \"provide a little bit of surprise and excitement\" to fans familiar with their classic forms. The musical score for \"Battle Network\" was composed by Akari Kaida, who would later work on the fifth installment of the series. All 22 musical tracks for \"Mega Man Battle Network\" were included on the \"Rockman EXE 1 ~ 3 Game Music Collection\", released in Japan by Suleputer on December 18, 2002.\n\nThe Japanese version of \"Battle Network\" was first announced in August 2000 as one of four games set to be released for the recently unveiled GBA. A demo of the game was promoted at Nintendo Space World that month, where it was displayed on only two out of the 140 playable consoles. The game was displayed on five kiosks at the Tokyo Game Show the following month. According to series planners Masakazu Eguchi and Masahiro Yasuma, this beta build of the game involved the player fighting a malevolent WoodMan.EXE within the school's electronic blackboard. \"Battle Network\" was officially released in Japan as a GBA launch title on March 21, 2001. A television advertisement of the game featured the song \"Neo Venus\" by Japanese rock band Janne Da Arc. The English localization of \"Battle Network\" was announced on May 17, 2001, just prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The game was released in North America and Europe on October 31 and November 30 respectively. Ubisoft published \"Mega Man Battle Network\" in PAL regions as part of a seven-GBA game licensing agreement with Capcom. Its first sequel, \"Mega Man Battle Network 2\", was announced before the Japan World Hobby Fair in June 2001. Attendees to the fair were able to download chip data for the character Bass.EXE into their original \"Battle Network\" cartridges.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Network\" has been generally well-received, holding aggregates score of 80% on GameRankings and 79 out of 100 on Metacritic. The graphics of \"Battle Network\" were overall favored by reviewers. IGN's Craig Harris, GameSpy contributor James Fudge, and Kristian Brogger of \"Game Informer\" were all impressed by the game's crisp, colorful style and futuristic locales. As far as the sound was concerned, Justin Speer of GameSpot opined that the music appropriately matched the rich visuals. Brogger otherwise accepted the sound as \"enough <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> to get by\", but that nothing would be missed if it were turned off. Harris comparably stated that \"the standard Japanese tunage could have been given a bit more variety\". The reviewers gave mixed opinions of the game's storyline. Though Brogger called it \"engrossing\", Harris recognized the plot as the game's one major fault, describing it as \"kiddy\" and disliking the consistent use of computer terminology for character names. Speer similarly summarized, \"If there's something that might hold you back from enjoying the game, it's the lighthearted and somewhat goofy story. However, the game doesn't take itself too seriously, so neither should you.\"\n\nThe battle system of \"Battle Network\" was a positive stand-out aspect for many critics. In his \"Battle Network\" series decade retrospective, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish felt the first game suffered from terrible plotting, unbalanced play design, and unattractive and annoying environment navigation. Still, Parish perceived the game's combat mechanics to be its sole reason for success, marrying the original \"Mega Man\" action qualities with an RPG structure and requiring \"a combination of sharp thinking and quick reflexes\" on the player's part. Speer found battle within the game to rightfully capture the spirit of \"Mega Man\" as its \"most original and compelling feature\". Harris likewise regarded the battle interface to be well-designed, a refreshing change from traditional Japanese RPGs, what gives the game its charm, and a very appreciative addition to the game's limited multiplayer mode. Fudge summarized the combat as \"very easy to learn, but difficult to master -- and yet very satisfying\". He admitted that the random encounters can occasionally be overwhelming. Brogger considered the gameplay both deep and simple to pick up on, but thought the menu system to be \"clunky\" at times and its battles to be repetitive.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Network\" entered Japanese sales charts at number 12, selling approximately 43,048 units during its first week. A total of 224,837 units were sold in Japan during 2001, with the game being listed by Dengeki Online as the 50th best-selling video game in the region for that year. The success of \"Mega Man Battle Network\" led to several sequels and spin-offs on other consoles, mobile phones, and arcade; an anime series; and numerous pieces of merchandise. A successor series called \"Mega Man Star Force\" began in 2006 after the Capcom decided to stop developing new \"Battle Network\" titles. \"Rockman EXE Operate Shooting Star\", a remake of the first \"Battle Network\" game for the Nintendo DS, was released in 2009 and integrated elements from the \"Star Force\" series.\n\n"}

His name appears in \"A Collection of the Names of the Merchants living in and about the City of London\" (1677), with the address \"Fan-church street\" (Fenchurch Street). He did not have any higher education and was admitted as a Fellow to the Royal Society at the age of 60.\n\nJohn Aubrey (1626–1697) reported that there was a group of men taking up the task of constructing a philosophical language left unfinished by John Wilkins (d. 1672). This group included Lodwick, besides Andrew Paschall (c. 1630–c. 1696), Thomas Pigott, Robert Hooke and John Ray, the latter being former members of Wilkin's original committee.\nLodwick had been working on a universal alphabet for some time, and Wilkins had borrowed some of Lodwick's papers for his 1668 \"Essay\". Hooke notes in his diary for 12 November 1673 that Lodwick had lent him a revised version of his universal alphabet. For 10 July 1675, Hooke notes that Lodwick had discussed the universal character with him and on 28 that he (Hooke) himself had written in the character. The group maintained correspondence until at least 1682.\nLodwick's alphabet consists of a system of representing consonants systematically; symbols indicating place of articulation (labial, dental, palatal, velar, sibilant) are modified by indication of the manner of articulation (voiced, voiceless, aspirated, nasal). Vowels are added as diacritics. This approach is entirely parallel to the tengwar alphabet, developed by J. R. R. Tolkien in the 1930s.\n\nLodwick may have been acquainted with Daniel Defoe. Francis' nephew Charles Lodwik (1658–1724), Mayor of New York City in 1694, signed at Defoe's marriage as a witness, and Francis may have introduced Defoe to \"Roscommon's Academy\", a group founded by Lord Roscommon in 1683.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Formerly it was published under the Marvel Knights imprint (as Marvel Knights Spider-Man, vol. 1, issues #1–22).\n\nThe underlying difference between this title and the other Spider-Man titles was that \"Marvel Knights Spider-Man\" was done with a more mature slant (in style if not content), thus the \"Marvel Knights\" prefix.\n\nIntended to replace the canceled \"Spider-Man's Tangled Web\" series, \"Marvel Knights Spider-Man\" was originally supposed to be written by Kevin Smith, but due to scheduling problems he was replaced by Mark Millar. When Millar completed his year-long story arc, he was followed by writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\nWith the consolidation of the Marvel Knights line, \"Marvel Knights Spider-Man\" was renamed \"The Sensational Spider-Man\" as of issue 23. At this time, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa took over writing duties on the book.\n\n\"The Sensational Spider-Man\" was canceled after issue 41. Following Joseph Michael Straczynski and Joe Quesada's \"\" storyline the series was canceled to allow \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" to be published three times a month starting in 2008.\n\nA second volume of \"Marvel Knights: Spider-Man\", written by Matt Kindt, was published as a limited series in late 2013 and early 2014.\n\nWhen Spider-Man finally sends the Green Goblin to jail, an unknown enemy, knowing that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, kidnaps Aunt May. After an embarrassing trip to the Avengers, Spidey visits the Owl, who says that Electro and the Vulture kidnapped her. This turns out to be a ploy by the Owl, who is after the two villains for stealing from him. Spidey goes through a brutal fight with a newly powered up Electro and is hospitalized. He is photographed (with most of his mask torn away) and is ambushed by the Vulture, only to be saved by the Black Cat who leaves Vulture in a bad physical condition due to her foul mood at the time of their fight. The photos are brought to J. Jonah Jameson, who says he thinks the partial face looks familiar.\n\nAlso in the panel (#4) where a wounded Peter is climbing up an office building three characters are visible bearing a striking resemblance to Clark Kent, Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane. On the side of the computer there is a note from a man named \"Perry\" and a picture of an \"S\" symbol.\n\n\nThe pictures of the unmasked Spider-Man are published by the \"Daily Bugle\", but Parker's face is too mangled to be identified. Jameson issues a $5 million reward for Spidey's alias. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus goes on a rampage and Eddie Brock auctions off the Venom costume, which is bought by the Fortunato family for the baby of the family, Angelo. Spidey visits the X-Men, where Rachel Summers tells him she thinks Aunt May is dead. Parker goes to his high school reunion and is attacked by Venom. During a gruelling battle, the suit abandons Angelo, who falls to his death. Eddie Brock is discovered to have slit his own wrists. May's kidnapper then calls Parker and asks him to lunch.\n\n\nThe kidnapper turns out to be the Scorpion, who is working for Norman Osborn. They blackmail Spidey to break Norman out of jail for his Aunt's safety, and after apologising to his Uncle Ben at his grave, he goes through with it. During the breakout, Spidey (along with the Black Cat) is attacked by the new Sinister 12, which includes the Scorpion as the new Venom. The 12, with the exclusion of the Goblin and Venom, battle the two heroes until many of the Marvel heroes come to save the day. Spidey chases after the Goblin, but is ambushed by Venom, whom he defeats. Spidey finds the Goblin on the Brooklyn Bridge with his wife, Mary Jane Watson. The two battle, but are interrupted by Doctor Octopus, who has been brainwashed to kill the Goblin by a shadowy organization. Spidey defeats them both, saves MJ, and rescues his Aunt, who is buried alive and unharmed in the grave of his Uncle Ben.\n\n\nAfter all the trauma of finding Aunt May and once again defeating the Green Goblin, Spider-Man is now a full member of the Avengers, living in Stark Tower with Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson. His summer-school job falls through, so he looks to the \"Daily Bugle\" for work. The Owl has placed a bounty on Spider-Man and the Absorbing Man and his unnamed female consultant are looking to collect. After a fight the unnamed woman stole Peter's wallet and starts looking for him at Aunt May and Peter's houses which are destroyed, so they leave none-the-wiser.\n\nAt the \"Daily Bugle\", Peter meets the new star reporter from Iowa, named Ethan Edwards. Ethan had amazing powers such as flight, super human strength, ability to see in every light spectrum, energy projection and even healing powers. Ethan's fundamentalist parents raised him to believe that \"with power there must also come great responsibility\" in life. Ethan asks Peter to train him and Peter agrees, so he takes him with the Fantastic Four to run some tests, which later on lead him to discover what he really is.\n\nMeanwhile, the Absorbing Man was critically wounded by the Punisher shortly after escaping from a robbery, and turns into steel to avoid bleeding to death. He absorbs the properties of cocaine (actually an unnamed drug, but the reference is clear enough) so the slug can be removed. The Owl's men use a high-powered electric fan to blow the Absorbing Man apart after he had turned into cocaine.\n\nThe cocaine remains of the Absorbing Man are sold on the streets, and the users temporarily gain the powers of the Absorbing Man.\n\n\nThese issues are part of the twelve-part crossover, \"\", one-third of which is told in \"Marvel Knights: Spider-Man\" (the other two-thirds told in \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\").\n\nThe second chapter of \"The Other\", \"Denial\", focuses on Mary Jane, who overhears that Spider-Man might be getting killed on television. She rushes to a bar to see the live coverage on TV, and she sees Spider-Man fighting Tracer, who is controlling Iron Man's armor and forcing him to attack Spider-Man. Later, at home, Mary Jane confronts Peter, telling him she thinks he has a death wish, but Peter interrupts her to tell her the news from the doctor.\n\nThe fifth chapter of \"The Other\", \"Retreat\", Peter, Mary Jane and Aunt May go to Latveria to use Dr. Doom's Time Machine to see past scenes in his life, like the day Richard Parker and Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker left Peter in the care of his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. After returning to Stark Tower, Peter briefly considers a trip to Las Vegas with Mary Jane, namely in Tony Stark's penthouse suite. He ultimately rejects the idea, assuming even if he managed to win big at the blackjack tables, some super-villain or other would end up disrupting the whole vacation. Later, Morlun searches for Spider-Man, in vain, as Peter and Mary–Jane are in one of Stark's space pods, looking down upon the Earth.\n\n\nCurt Connors takes a look at \"The Rock of Life\" which causes a mysterious disease and causes many characters to become very angry, including Man-Wolf, Vermin, The Lizard, Black Cat, Puma and others. The Black Cat has the hardest time controlling her anger, almost killing The Lizard in a fury. Mary Jane also finds herself with a knife in a fit of rage. It is soon discovered that the rock was brought to New York by the villain Stegron with the aim of regressing all of humanity. Spider-Man, who has been able to show the most resistance to the rock, stops him.\n\n\nDue to the events in \"Civil War\" No. 2, Spider-Man has unmasked to the world. Jordan Harrison, one of Peter's students, is shocked to learn this. When Doctor Octopus discovers that Spider-Man was only fifteen when he first defeated him, he goes on a rampage through New York. Jordan Harrison distracts Doc Ock so Spidey can knock him out.\n\nThis story was included in the second compilation of Civil War involving Spider-Man, entitled \"\"Peter Parker, Spider-Man\"\".\n\n\nNow that the world knows Spidey's identity, The Chameleon arranges his deadliest foes to go after his loved ones. Black Cat is angry that Spider-Man has gone public, but she teams up with him to stop his foes all the same.\n\n\nThese three issues deal with how the women in Spider-Man's life are affected by his unmasking. The issues deal with Mary Jane Watson-Parker, Aunt May, and the Black Cat respectively. The storyline focuses on each of the women reacting to not only Peter's public unmasking, but also a brutal beating that Peter receives at the hands of the Rhino.\n\n\nSpider-Man copycats start turning up in Manhattan, with some of them having the same powers as Peter. After Spider-Man finds one of them and sees that something is seriously wrong, he takes him to see Mr. Fantastic while Doc Connors investigates the strange fluids on a blanket the doppelganger had been in contact with.\n\n\nEddie Brock, wasting away from cancer, finds that Peter's Aunt May is in the very same hospital, and he hatches one final plan to take his revenge against Spider-Man.\n\n\nPeter's guilt deepens as he fears that his Aunt May will die from injuries sustained during an attack that was targeted at him. Peter reflects on the amount of death and tragedy he has encountered (Uncle Ben, Gwen Stacy, etc.) due to his leading a double-life as Spider-Man. As despair consumes him, he is visited by a mysterious stranger (God) who conveys to him that in life tragedy affects everyone in some form or another. Also, he explains that due to Spider-Man's heroic efforts, many people are alive and well, and that should bring him some comfort. While alleviating some of Peter's guilt, the information doesn't change the helplessness that Peter feels towards his situation. The story concludes with the stranger telling Peter to have faith, and that he has asked a lot more from people much closer to him, a possible reference to Jesus Christ. The last page is Peter living as an old man with his wife, giving Spider-Man a happy ending.\n\n\n\"See \"\" article for synopsis.\"\n\n\"NOTE: Issue #41 marked the final \"The Sensational Spider-Man\" (vol. 2) issue.

{"id": "2175410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175410", "title": "Valley Metro", "text": "Valley Metro\n\nThe Valley Metro Regional Public Transportation Authority, more popularly known as Valley Metro, is the unified public brand of the regional transit system in and around the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area, responsible for public transit. Within the system, it is divided between Valley Metro Bus, which runs all bus operations, and Valley Metro Rail, which is responsible for light rail operations in the Valley.\n\nValley Metro is a membership organization. Most services are separately funded and operated by individual cities and suburbs in the greater Phoenix region. These cities have agreed to participate in Valley Metro as a unifying brand name to streamline service and reduce confusion among riders. Each city appoints a representative to the RPTA board of directors, and a chairman, vice chairman, and treasurer are voted on amongst the board members for a one-year term.\n\nThe two largest operators of bus service are the city of Phoenix and the Regional Public Transportation Authority (operating multi-city routes and services primarily in Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, and Tempe). Circulator service in Glendale is operated by the city of Glendale directly, the Scottsdale Trolley circulators are contracted by the city of Scottsdale, and intra-city paratransit service in the cities of Glendale and Peoria are operated by the respective cities directly.\n\nThe RPTA operates a customer service, marketing and long-range transit planning operation from headquarters in downtown Phoenix which is shared among all Valley Metro member cities. A few routes which operate within several member cities have their funding and operations shared between those cities. Some RPTA funding is used to augment service provided by the member cities (this is expected to increase over the next several years due to a 2004 voter approval of an extension to the original 1985 sales tax for transit funding). The city of Phoenix alone operates 73 percent of all Valley Metro routes (several of which also serve suburban cities).\n\nThe RPTA was formed in 1985 as the result of Phoenix-area voters approving a one-half percent sales tax increase for expansion of the local freeway system, and for expansion of mass transit. The RPTA was then chartered under the laws of the state of Arizona. At the time, almost all transit service in the Phoenix area was operated by Phoenix Transit System, with a few other bus services such as in Mesa (Mesa Sunrunner) and Scottsdale (Scottsdale Connection) having started around 1990. Valley Metro, as an integrated regional transit service, did not begin operations under its own brand identity until 1993, when the RPTA board of directors chose that name, the logo, and color scheme as described below. At this time, Phoenix Transit System and Mesa Sunrunner were rebranded as Valley Metro, and several new routes operating under the RPTA were started.\n\nPrior to the formation of the RPTA, the bus route structure of Phoenix Transit System was quite different, both in terms of numbering and routes. Previously, the bus system was based on a \"hub-and-spoke\" structure with most routes starting from downtown Phoenix. These routes were split in half by Central Avenue, which most routes used to access downtown Phoenix. For example, the western half of Van Buren Street was served by route 3W, and the eastern half of Van Buren Street was served by route 3E. Most bus routes inherited a seemingly arbitrary, but chronologically assigned, system from their Phoenix Street Railway heritage (for example, route 0-Central was originally numbered route 5). Express routes were numbered in the 80s and 90s (for example: route 510 serving Scottsdale was originally numbered route 90, which is today assigned to route 90-Dunlap/Cave Creek).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the route structure was changed to form the basis for the system operating today. Most routes were restructured so that they would stay on a single street rather than be based out of the downtown terminal. Routes that operated on multiple streets were also split (for example, route 22-Camelback Crosstown covers parts of today's route 50 and route 72). The route numbering system was simplified so that bus routes were numbered according to the block number of the street that they operated on. For example, route 50-Camelback is numbered because it runs mostly on Camelback Road, which is in the 5000 block. Because of the establishment of route numbers in the 80s and 90s, the express routes were renumbered to the 500-series, where they remain today. The second digit of the 500-series express routes denotes the region of the metropolitan area where the bus is traveling to (for example, the 510 series go to Scottsdale, the 530 series go to Mesa, and the 570 series go to the Northwest Valley). The evolution to a full \"supergrid\" structure continues today as route branches are either replaced with circulators or separated into new routes.\n\nOriginally, the buses of one of Valley Metro's predecessors, Phoenix Transit System, were painted with an orange and pink stripe, and a logo on the sides, rear and front, featuring a character known as \"Tico\", which was a sun wearing sunglasses, and a sombrero. In the late 1980s, this logo disappeared and buses were simply labeled \"City of Phoenix Transit System\". In 1993–1994, the RPTA changed the colors to a green and purple color scheme (which many vehicles still have), with a green stripe and a large purple \"V\" on the passenger's side, and the reverse on the driver's side.\n\nIn 2006, a simplified color scheme was introduced with the delivery of the C40LFR buses. This scheme is similar to the previous scheme except that the \"V\" has been removed (it obscured visibility from inside the buses in many cases), there is only a green stripe around the bus, the Valley Metro logo is displayed on the front, rear, and rear sides of the bus, and the sides are lettered \"Valley\" in purple and \"Metro\" in white. All new buses delivered to the RPTA from 2006 onwards feature a new interior very similar to that of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) but with darker tinted windows, no Transit TV (since all Valley Metro divisions except for the City of Phoenix divisions and Valley Metro Rail prohibit advertising), and blue seat fabric (as opposed to the \"rainbow\" seat fabric used on LACMTA buses). Buses delivered to the city of Phoenix from 2006 to 2008 feature a similar interior to those delivered from 1993-2006 but with the same seat fabric used on the RAPID bus rapid transit buses.\n\nOn December 27, 2008, Valley Metro introduced a new logo, replacing the \"V\" logo that had been in place since 1993. The green and purple colors were retained, but the green was made lighter and the purple was made darker. The new logo as well as the new shades of green and purple were introduced on the Valley Metro LINK arterial bus rapid transit service, as well as a new interior color scheme.\n\nOn October 30, 2009, Valley Metro introduced a concept paint scheme on two New Flyer C40LFR's which are serving as demonstration units for the new scheme. The scheme consists of a silver body with a green and purple swoosh going from forward of the front wheel to the rear of the CNG tanks. Riders were provided surveys which were collected and information reviewed. This scheme became official on all RPTA-owned buses (not including the LINK buses) built since 2010. The LINK buses used a variant of this scheme, with a purple front instead of silver.\n\nIn 2010, the City of Tempe introduced a variant of the new Valley Metro scheme with a green front instead of silver on one New Flyer L40LFR. This became the official scheme for all Tempe-owned buses starting with the 2011 New Flyer C40LFRs.\n\nIn 2013, the City of Phoenix introduced a new scheme for its fleet. They differ from the RPTA- and Tempe-owned fleet in that the body is mostly painted white and the green and purple swoosh wraps around the front and rear of the bus. This modification in design was likely made to accommodate advertisements below the windows, since the City of Phoenix is the only operator (other than Valley Metro Rail) that allows advertisements on its fleet.\n\nIn the early years of Valley Metro and throughout the 1990s, the Phoenix metropolitan area was the largest in the United States with transit service operating only Monday through Saturday, with no Sunday service or Saturday night service (after 8 p.m.) at all. Even on weekdays, some bus service ended as early as 7 or 8 p.m. This schedule was a huge hardship for a large portion of the Phoenix labor force (some of whom had to walk or bicycle long distances to and from work when bus service did not operate) and may have deterred some who wanted to relocate to the Phoenix area.\n\nThat began to change in 2001, when Valley Metro expanded to Sunday service in Phoenix, Glendale, and Scottsdale, with Tempe having Sunday service since 1999 (this resulted in large part from the approval of the Transit 2000 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which involved a new 0.4 percent sales tax in the city of Phoenix, with the other cities approving similar measures around the same time).\n\nIn 2002, the cities of Tempe and Scottsdale merged BOLT (Better Options for Local Transit) and Scottsdale Connection into the Valley Metro system in order to unify the Valley Metro brand and to reduce confusion (especially along the Red Line, which was operated by both Phoenix and Tempe and used Valley Metro and BOLT branded vehicles). All of the BOLT buses were repainted into standard Valley Metro colors (they still have a different interior from other Valley Metro buses) and the Scottsdale Connection buses were replaced. However, before the merger, the systems were featured in the Valley Metro Bus Book and had the same fare structure as the rest of the system, i.e. basically a different brand.\n\nIn addition, in 2004, Proposition 400 was passed, which extended a half-cent sales tax originally earmarked entirely for freeways. The tax was revised to provide funding for not only freeways, but \"supergrid\" bus service, (concentrated along Phoenix grid streets), bus rapid transit, and light rail extensions.\n\nThe rest of the service area still had no Sunday service as of the fall of 2008, with the exception of the portion of route 72 (see below) that runs into Chandler, the section of route 156 that runs across Chandler, and routes 61 and 96, which established regular Sunday service in selected portions of the city of Mesa in July 2008. As of 2018, Sunday service is provided in the East Valley on all local routes except the 104-Alma School Road, 120-Mesa Drive, 128-Stapley Drive, 136-Gilbert Road, and 140-Ray Road. As of 2018, Routes 45-Broadway and 77-Baseline do not serve Mesa on Sundays, and Route 96-Dobson does not serve Chandler on Sundays.\n\nIn 1989, a referendum took place in the RPTA constituent cities on expanded bus services (the fleet size would nearly have been tripled) and the implementation of elevated rail as part of a plan called \"ValTrans\".\n\nThe locations of three of Valley Metro's most heavily traveled bus routes (before the December 2008 start of light rail service) would have been the elevated rail lines' paths, and referred to by these color designations:\n\n\nFunding for would have come from a sales tax plan with a set expiration and reapproval date by 2019, a 30 year authorization period. The ValTrans proposal was soundly defeated at the polls. Concerns about noise, cost, and overall effectiveness were prominent, as well as voter frustration over the lack of progress on existing road and freeway construction.\n\nSimilar referendums were later voted down in 1993 and 1997, although Tempe voters passed a half-percent sales tax dedicated for transit (which partly allowed officials to study light rail) in 1996.\n\nWith the start of light rail service in December 2008, these color-coded designations were retired. The Red Line was eliminated altogether as most of the route is now covered by the light rail line (with several portions, including Metrocenter Mall, now also covered by Route 15-15th Avenue); the Blue Line was renamed to Route 39 – 40th Street and now terminates at the intersection of Camelback Road and Central Avenue; the Green Line was renamed Route 29 – Thomas (its original pre-ValTrans name); its routing remains unchanged.\n\nIn 2000, the Transit 2000 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which involved a 0.4 percent sales tax, was approved by voters in Phoenix. It sought to improve the local bus service and create bus rapid transit and light rail, among other things. Valley Metro Rail has a goal of a one-third farebox ratio, and the RTP anticipates this to rise to 45% by 2025. The plan implemented studies for further rail service, though for some time in the future. It also used the route placing and color designations from the 1989 plan.\n\nIn August 2015, Phoenix voters passed Proposition 104, increasing the sales tax allocated to transit from 0.4 to 0.7%. It is expected to partially pay for a $31 billion transit plan over 35 years. Under the plan, about half of the new revenue will go to bus service, a third to light rail, 7% to street improvements, and 10% to debt service. of light rail are planned to be built.\n\nValley Metro operates bus routes around the Phoenix area through private companies in Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe, Glendale, and other parts of Maricopa County. These include fixed routes on city streets, suburban Express buses, RAPID buses, and circulators in parts of Phoenix, Glendale, Tempe, Mesa, Avondale, and Scottsdale.\n\nValley Metro Rail operates a route between the cities of Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa. The system was most recently expanded in March 2016, with four additional extensions in the design or pre-construction phases, with expected opening dates ranging from 2018 to 2030. Future extensions include service to Metrocenter Mall, the Arizona State Capitol building, and Baseline Road, all in Phoenix.\n\nValley Metro offers paratransit for elderly and disabled residents via its Paratransit service. Paratransit providers include:\n\nValley Metro Paratransit operates all trips within the East Valley service area (defined as Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Scottsdale, and Tempe), the Northwest Valley service area (defined as El Mirage, Surprise, Youngtown, and unincorporated county areas within the Northwest Valley including Sun City and Sun City West), as well as regional trips (defined as trips that cross service area boundaries). Phoenix Dial-A-Ride operates trips within Phoenix and the cities and towns of Paradise Valley, Avondale, Goodyear, Litchfield Park, and Tolleson. Glendale Dial-A-Ride and Peoria Dial-A-Ride operate trips within their respective cities. Service area boundaries vary by city, with some cities only offering service within of a fixed bus route while other cities offer service in a larger area. To handle overflow demand, some trips on Valley Metro Paratransit and Phoenix Dial-A-Ride are outsourced to local taxi companies or to non-emergency medical transportation providers.\n\nOther commuting options are coordinated by Valley Metro's Rideshare department, funded by contracts with Maricopa County and the Maricopa Association of Governments. The primary outreach effort of the Rideshare team is the Maricopa County Trip Reduction Program, which seeks to reduce traffic impacts on air pollution and emissions throughout the Valley. Any employer with 50 or more full-time employees is required to participate in the program, which seeks to convince employees to use transit alternatives. The 25,000 employees of State of Arizona government agencies who work and live in the Valley have their own Rideshare department, called Capitol Rideshare.\n\nThe table at right shows the current fare structure for the Valley Metro system, since August 28, 2017.\nCurrently, all of the above passes (excluding 1-Ride trips) are sold on magnetic stripe cards, which must be activated when boarding a bus, or activated by a Ticket Vending Machine prior to boarding light rail. Failure to pay or activate appropriate fare when boarding a transit vehicle may carry a fine of up to $500.\n\nArizona State University (ASU) students and employees are eligible to participate in the ASU U-Pass program, allowing them to access the system at a discounted rate. Students, faculty, and other eligible staff may purchase their U-Pass from any ASU parking office.\n\nUp to three children under the age of five riding with a fare-paying adult can ride free. Limited Stop service such as the Grand Avenue Limited are charged as local service.\n\nAs part of Proposition 104, a replacement system using contactless cards is under development to replace the current system, and is provisionally scheduled for deployment in fiscal year 2017. The system will likely resemble the current Platinum Pass, which is only available through selected Phoenix-area employers and also the TAP card system, currently in use by the LACMTA in Los Angeles, including features like stored value, online account management, and mobile ticketing capabilities.\n\nValley Metro has used a contactless card system, the Platinum Pass, since 2011 in a limited capacity; the Platinum Pass is available exclusively through selected public and private-sector employers for distribution to their employees through their human resources (or dedicated ridesharing/transit) departments, with fares at least partially subsidized by the employer as part of the above-mentioned Trip Reduction Program (developed to control the air pollution problem long plaguing the Phoenix area). Any employee contribution to the fare is usually deducted from the employee paycheck. A similar ADA Platinum Pass is also available for qualifying people with disabilities.\n\n\n\n"}

Since she was having trouble with the birth, Mach called a veterinarian, D.L. Crump, to help. Dr. Crump tied Grady to a post so she would hold still. When he was finished taking care of her, she was untied. She then whirled around and started chasing Bill, who jumped on a pile of cottonseed sacks to escape.\n\nGrady dove for the only light in the shed, which was from the small opening to the silo; the opening was only 17 inches wide and 25 and a half inches high. Mach and Dr. Crump looked toward the silo opening and saw a few red hairs clinging to the edge of the heavy steel silo door. Grady was in the silo. The opening could not be made wider because it was encased in steel. Mach did not want to tear down the silo as it was too valuable, nor did he want to slaughter Grady, who was worth over $1,000.\n\nBill Mach asked for help through his local newspaper, and the response was overwhelming. Mach and his brother received 5,400 letters and 700 telegrams from people from 45 states and Canada and Germany. Phone calls, telegrams and letters all flowed in; curious people started showing up at the Mach farm in cars and even planes. Grady was featured in \"Life\", \"TIME\", and newspapers all over the country.\n\nPeople offered a variety of solutions for getting Grady out of the silo. The suggestions included rigging a pole to swing her out the top of the silo, tunneling under the silo, and bringing an attractive bull to the opening to lure her out. An Air Force officer said he knew of a helicopter that would lift but it was in San Marcos, Texas. Three days after Grady's leap, Bill Mach got a call from Ralph Partridge, the farming editor of \"The Denver Post\", who told Mach he was coming to Yukon to get Grady out of the silo.\n\nPartridge supervised while a ramp was built from the floor of the silo to the opening. He coated the ramp and the opening with axle grease. Partridge then smeared Grady with 10 pounds of axle grease, and she was outfitted with two heavy halters. Dr. Crumb recommended that Grady be milked before they attempted to pull her out, so J.O. Dickey Jr., Yukon vocational agriculture teacher, went in the silo and milked her. After Grady had been brought up to the opening, Dr. Crumb gave her tranquilizers to make her relax. While men outside the silo pulled on ropes attached to her halters, Partridge and J.O. Dicky Jr., a Yukon vocational agriculture teacher, pushed. Grady slid through the opening, and veterinarians stated that she had not been injured during the rescue.\n\nGrady was a local celebrity for the rest of her life. The March 7, 1949 issue of \"Life\" magazine featured a picture taken from the top of the silo that showed Grady trapped inside it; text at one corner of the picture read, \"Imprisoned by the concrete walls of a silo, an Oklahoma cow eyes the tiny opening...through which she entered and later escaped.\"\n\nShe marched in the Capitol Hill '89ers Parade in Oklahoma City on April 21, 1949. Later that year, she was exhibited at the Oklahoma State Fair. Grady went on to become a mother several times; she had four heifers and two bulls. Tourists regularly came to see her on the Mach farm, and she was such a tourist attraction that Mach put up a sign on Route 66 noting her home. He kept Grady in a special pen by the road.\n\nGrady the cow died on July 24, 1961. The old silo was torn down in 1997, and a regional hospital was built on the site.\n\nTwo children's books have been written describing and illustrating the story of Grady the Cow. The first, \"The Cow in the Silo\", was published in 1950 by Wonder Book Company. The second, \"Grady's In the Silo\", won the 2004 Oklahoma Book Award for Children's Literature. The story of Grady has also been featured in a school curriculum for kindergarten through 2nd grade students published by the Oklahoma State University Extension Service.\n\n"}

Fame would come with his first feature, \"Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley\", to be followed by numerous sequels that would make it the highest grossing Spanish film series.\n\nSantiago was born in the Carabanchel neighbourhood in Madrid. After studying Arts at the Complutense University of Madrid, he decided to pursue a career as a filmmaker and in 1989 he directed the short \"Relatos de medianoche\" with a budget of 7000 pesetas (around US$50). In 1992 he went on to direct his first professional short \"Evilio\", followed with \"Perturbado\" in 1993.\n\nSegura is a recurring protagonist in the works of directors Alex de la Iglesia and Guillermo del Toro.\n\nIn 1993, he had a small role in Alex de la Iglesia's film \"Acción mutante\". Two years later, he starred in \"El día de la Bestia\", from the same director and that role made him famous in Spain. In 1998 he directed the film that brought him to stardom, \"Torrente: El brazo tonto de la ley\" (1998), in which he also acted as the lead character José Luis Torrente, a sleazy crime-fighter. Its popularity led to a sequel (\"\") and a computer game (\"Torrente: El juego\").\n\n\"Torrente 2: Misión en Marbella\" made €22,838,500 at the Spanish box office, becoming the highest grossing Spanish film of all time. \"\", the third film in the series, was released in September 2005.

He is one of the top selling Amazon Kindle authors, the second bestselling UK author worldwide on Kindle in 2011.\n\nLeather was born in Manchester. He grew up in Sale and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and attended Manchester Grammar School. He attended Bath University, where he obtained a BSc in Biochemistry in 1978.\n\nLeather was employed as a biochemist for ICI, shovelled limestone in a quarry, worked as a baker, a petrol pump attendant, a barman, and worked for the Inland Revenue. He began his writing career as a journalist, working for newspapers such the \" Glasgow Herald\", \"Daily Mirror\", \"The Times\", \"Daily Mail\", and the \"South China Morning Post\" in Hong Kong.\n\nLeather began writing when he was in college; however, he \"never managed to get beyond a few pages,\" and did not begin writing full-time until he had worked as a journalist for more than ten years.\n\nHis first novel, \"Pay Off\", was written while he was still employed at \"The Daily Mirror\". It was published from the \"slush pile\" at HarperCollins. The novel is a thriller about a merchant banker who takes revenge on two gangsters who killed his father. The book is set in Scotland, where Leather worked for five years on \"The Glasgow Herald\" as a business writer.\n\nHis second novel, \"The Fireman\", was written while he was working as the business editor of the \"South China Morning Post\". In \"The Fireman\", a British tabloid journalist travels to Hong Kong to discover why his sister committed suicide. Both novels, and his third, \"Hungry Ghost\", were published by HarperCollins.\n\nLeather wrote his fourth novel, \"The Chinaman\", while working as night news editor on the business desk of \"The Times\" in London. At the time, the Provisional Irish Republican Army's bombing campaign was at its height, and in \"The Chinaman\", a Sino-Vietnamese man loses his family in an attack loosely based on the bombing of the Harrods department store in London. Having been turned away by the authorities, the man, a highly decorated Special Forces fighter in the Vietnam War, travels to Ireland and hunts down the people responsible. The book was used as the basis for the 2017 thriller \"The Foreigner\".\n\nLeather's novels frequently include themes of crime, imprisonment, military service, and terrorism. Settings are typically London and the Far East. Leather writes different series in slightly different genres. The main character of one series, Dan 'Spider' Shepherd, is a former Special Air Service soldier who becomes an undercover policeman. Another series, \"Jack Nightingale\", is about a former police negotiator who becomes a private investigator; this supernatural detective series is also published by Hodder & Stoughton and includes the books \"Nightfall\", \"Midnight\", \"Nightmare\", \"Nightshade\" and \"Lastnight\".\n\nLeather has written screenplays for \"London's Burning\", \"The Knock\", and the BBC's \"Murder in Mind\" series. Two of his novels, \"The Stretch\" and \"The Bombmaker\", were screened for made for TV movies and filmed for Sky Television. \"The Stretch\" starred Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson, two popular soap opera stars from the U.K.\n\nLeather became successful in the Amazon Kindle market in 2010. Amazon UK opened an eBook store that year. As reported in \"The Guardian\", Leather anticipated that people buying eBooks would be seeking bargains, and he priced his books at the minimum price for independent writers in order to get his books into the top ten. He then marketed the books on various forums online.\n\nEarly in 2011, Leather's books \"The Basement\", \"Hard Landing\", and the vampire novella \"Once Bitten\" occupied the top three places in the UK Kindle bestseller list, a feat matched only by Stieg Larsson with his \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" trilogy. That same year, Leather was the second bestselling UK author on the Kindle worldwide, beaten only by Lee Child.\n\nIn 2002, Leather's book \"Tango One\" was nominated for the inaugural CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger, awarded by the Crime Writers' Association. His book \"Hard Landing\" was nominated for the award in 2004.\n\nHis book \"Cold Kill\" was nominated for Best Novel in 2007 by International Thriller Writers Inc. In 2011, Leather sold over 500,000 eBooks and was voted by \"The Bookseller\" magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the UK publishing world.\n\nOn 5 August 2012, journalist Nick Cohen wrote in \"The Observer\" that Leather had created phony Twitter accounts in the name of another writer, and used those accounts to praise Leather's own books. Cohen quoted Leather's response to a question, as a panelist, at the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival, which was recorded for BBC Radio 4:\n\n\"As soon as my book is out I'm on Facebook and Twitter several times a day talking about it. I'll go on to several forums, the well-known forums, and post there under my name and under various other names and various other characters. You build up this whole network of characters who talk about your books and sometimes have conversations with yourself.\"\n\nLeather's comment was widely reported, and, on 3 September 2012, forty nine other British authors issued a group statement in which they \"unreservedly condemn\" the use of sockpuppets, or paid reviews.\n\nJeremy Duns and Steve Mosby have alleged that Leather has harassed them online.\n\n\n"}

While legend associates two other bishops with the see, the only historically documented one is Gaudentius, who took part in a synod at Rome called by Pope Hilarius in 465.\n\nUnder the Latin name Bettonium the bishopric is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nBettona still retains a complete circuit of medieval walls incorporating portions of the original Etruscan walls. The town was sacked in 1352 and very little remains save the churches that have since been completely updated. The town was ordered rebuilt by Cardinal Albornoz who built a small rocca where the Church of San Crispolto stands.

She was the half sister of R&B singer Pennye Ford.\n\nSharon Redd was born in Norfolk, Virginia, to Gene and Katherine Redd. Gene Redd was a producer and musical director at King Records, and her stepfather performed with Benny Goodman's orchestra. Her brother Gene Redd Jr. was a songwriter and producer for Kool & the Gang and the band BMP. Her half-sister Pennye Ford is also a singer with two solo albums to her credit and known for her work as the main singer for Snap!, Soul II Soul, and The S.O.S. Band.\n\nShe began her recording career with four singles in 1968 for the United Artists label, three written and all four produced by songwriter and record producer Bobby Susser. Susser chose the Hank Williams song \"Half As Much\" to be Redd's first single. Redd's vocals, against Susser's heavy-bass track, made her presence very quickly known to R&B radio stations. Redd, as a budding actress, got a major break when she starred in an Australian production of the rock musical \"Hair\". She was among a troupe of young African-American imports to the Sydney production, a group which notably included Marcia Hines. Redd appeared in the production from its June 6, 1969, premiere through 1971.\n\nAs Redd was becoming famous in Australia, she was interviewed by Barry Sloane on a 1971 episode of \"\"GTK\"\". Her popular adverts for Amoco led to her own television special. Redd and \"Hair\" co-star Teddy Williams were asked to leave Australia by the Immigration Department in April 1971 for reasons they believed were race-motivated. Aside from \"Hair\", Redd also appeared in \"Ti-Jean and His Brothers\" and, in 1974, traveled to London to star in an American production of \"The Wedding of Iphigenia\". In 1977 Redd played the role of Sherrye in the U.S. television sitcom \"Rhoda\". 1978 also saw Redd feature as a guest in the musical \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Bette Midler was looking to replace Merle Miller and Gail Kantor, both of whom had left after Midler's 1973 tour to pursue their own interests. Midler auditioned over 70 performers, but Redd landed the job, becoming one of Bette's Harlettes. Aside from performing as a Harlette, Redd also provided backing vocals for Carol Douglas (\"Burnin'\" and \"Night Fever\") and Norman Connors (\"You Are My Starship\"). Having ended their association with Midler, Redd, Charlotte Crossley, & Ula Hedwig released an LP, \"Formerly of the Harlettes\", in late 1977. In 1978, RCA Victor released \"Love Insurance\" on a 12\" disco as Front Page\nw/ Sharon Redd. She was credited on that version.\n\nIn 1979, Redd recorded the disco hit \"Love Insurance\", released by Panorama Records under the name Front Page, her own vocals going uncredited. But she soon signed a recording contract with Prelude Records, and Redd became the label's most successful artist. Her first album, 1980's self-titled \"Sharon Redd\", was closely followed by two more—\"Redd Hott\" (1982) and \"Love How You Feel\" (1983). Redd placed several songs on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, including \"Beat the Street\", \"In the Name of Love\" and \"Love How You Feel\".\n\nAfter these releases, Sharon Redd returned to her successful career as a background vocalist, most notably with the group Soirée, which also included among its members Luther Vandross and Jocelyn Brown. Following the UK top 20 success of a re-recorded \"Can You Handle It\" by DNA, she recorded a single entitled \"All the Way to Love\", with Les Adams. The song remains unreleased. This was to be her last solo recording.\n\nIn the midst of mounting a comeback in the early 1990s, Redd died of pneumonia on May 1, 1992. \"Dance Music Report\" magazine reported that her death was AIDS-related. The virus had weakened her immune system, which had become ineffective following the singer stepping on broken glass on stage.\n\nIn 1993, Pennye Ford dropped the 'e' from her name and released the album \"Penny Ford\", which featured a duet with her sister entitled \"Under Pressure.\"\n\n\n‡ Denotes tracks from US Dance-charting LP \"Redd Hot\" which included all cuts.\n\n\n"}

He entered the Prussian Gardes du Corps in 1825, transferring the following year into the Guard Infantry, with which he served for many years as a subaltern. In 1839 he was appointed an instructor in the Cadet Corps, and later he was employed in the topographical bureau of the Great General Staff. In 1842-1843 he took part in the Russian operations in the Caucasus, and on his return to Germany in 1846, was placed, as a captain, on the staff. In 1848 he married. Regimental and staff duty alternately occupied him until 1863, when he was made major-general, and given the command of a brigade of Guard Infantry.\n\nIn the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Werder greatly distinguished himself at Gitschin and Königgratz at the head of the 3rd division. He returned home with the rank of lieutenant-general and the Order Pour le Mérite. In 1870, at first employed with the 3rd Army Headquarters and in command of the Württemberg and Baden forces, he was after the Battle of Wörth entrusted with the operations against Strasbourg, which he captured after a long and famous siege.\n\nPromoted general of infantry, and assigned to command the new XIVth Army Corps, Werder defeated the French at Dijon and at Nuits, and, when Charles-Denis Bourbaki's army moved forward to relieve Belfort, turned upon him and fought the desperate action of Battle of Villersexel, which enabled him to cover the Germans besieging Belfort. On 15, 16 and 17 January 1871, Werder with greatly inferior forces succeeded in holding his own on the Battle of the Lisaine against all Bourbaki's efforts to reach Belfort, a victory which aroused great enthusiasm in southern Germany. In the course of this ethustiastic prevailing mood a monument, the Siegesdenkmal, was erected in Freiburg im Breisgau to honor his services and the victory of the German people in the Franco-Prussian War. After the war Werder commanded the Baden forces, now called the XlVth Army Corps, until he retired in 1879. On his retirement he was raised to the dignity of count.

It was filmed at Shepperton Studios, London, with some location work at Osterley House in Middlesex.\n\nAlthough based on Conan Doyle's characters, the story is an original one, which has the famous detective on the trail of Jack the Ripper. The story of \"A Study in Terror\" challenges Sherlock Holmes to solve these horrific crimes. This leads Holmes through a trail of aristocracy, blackmail and family insanity. Unlike Scotland Yard, and the real-life story, Holmes eventually discovers the true identity of the Ripper.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Leicester Square Theatre in the West End of London on 4 November 1965. \"A Study in Terror\" presents the first film appearance of Mycroft Holmes.\n\nIn the dark alleys of London, the notorious Jack the Ripper is committing a series of gruesome murders. Holmes and Watson, already intrigued by reports of the Jack the Ripper murders, become involved when they receive a parcel from Whitechapel containing a case of surgical instruments with the scalpel, possibly the murder weapon, missing. By a family crest on the box, they come into contact with the Duke of Shires who admits his elder son Michael Osborne dreamed of becoming a doctor. His younger son, Lord Carfax, tells them Michael has disappeared. Holmes deduces the instruments were pawned to a broker, Joseph Beck, who tells them that he received them from an Angela Osborne, who gave her address as a soup kitchen run by Doctor Murray.\n\nHolmes and Watson meet Murray, also a police pathologist, after convincing Lestrade to let them view the body of the most recent victim, Annie Chapman. Holmes convinces Watson to go to the soup kitchen and make a fuss of looking for Angela. A disguised Holmes then follows Murray's niece Sally when she goes to meet Carfax. They explain Carfax was blackmailed by a man who threatened to tell his father that Michael, who was helping Murray at the soup kitchen, had married a prostitute. Carfax now works there himself but Michael was gone before he and Sally arrived. The blackmailer, Max Steiner, now runs a local public house.\n\nThe Prime Minister asks Mycroft Holmes to convince his brother to investigate the Ripper case, unaware that he is already involved. Holmes and Watson nearly catch the Ripper when he kills another prostitute who invites him into her room. Holmes confronts Murray who explains that Michael had learned that Angela had assisted Steiner with the blackmail. During an altercation between the three of them, Angela was disfigured when acid was thrown in her face. Murray also reveals his crippled and mentally disabled assistant is Michael, the result of a brutal beating from Steiner. Holmes and Watson discover Angela in the upper room of Steiner's inn and she admits that she sent them the surgical instruments, having removed the scalpel herself, to get them involved. Holmes and Watson return Michael to his family.\n\nDuring the night, Holmes discovers Carfax attempting to kill Angela in her room; he is the Ripper. The pub catches alight during a struggle; Carfax, Steiner and Angela are all killed in the blaze but Holmes escapes. He explains to Watson that Carfax had no way of identifying Angela so he killed every prostitute that he came across in the hope that one of them would be her. With all those involved dead, Holmes elects to keep the truth from the police.\n\nProducer Herman Cohen originally wanted to title the film \"Fog\" but Columbia insisted on the title \"A Study in Terror\" to tie in with the Sherlock Holmes novel \"A Study in Scarlet\". Cohen also recalled on its US release Columbia advertised the film as a then-popular tongue in cheek \"Batman\"-type film rather than a horror or detective film.\n\n\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" gave a lackluster review saying \"the film marks time lamely in the intervals between its conventionally shock-cut murders, while John Neville and Donald Houston uncomfortably mouth their lines as if suspecting that nobody will listen.\" \"Variety\" felt that \"though the mixture of fiction and fact doesn't entirely click...An excellent cast gives the production fill value.\" \"The New York Times\" said \"the entire cast, director and writers do play their roles well enough to make wholesale slaughter a pleasant diversion.\"\n\nIn 1966, the film was made into a novel by Ellery Queen and Paul W. Fairman. The novelisation is unusual in that it adds a framing story wherein Ellery Queen reads a manuscript that re-tells the actions of the film. The framing story was written by Ellery Queen and the novelisation of the film itself by Fairman.\n\nThe Holmes-Ripper idea was later taken up in \"Murder by Decree\" (1978), in which Frank Finlay reprised his role as Lestrade and Anthony Quayle once again had an important part (though this time as Sir Charles Warren of Scotland Yard).\n\nThe film inspired the writing of \"Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds\" (1975), blending the story of Sherlock Holmes and the world of H.G. Wells' science fiction novel \"The War of the Worlds\".\n\n\"A Study in Terror\" (1965) was composed by John Scott in his first feature film score conducting the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra (HSO 333).\n\n\n"}

Great Lakes Airlines was the only airline to service the airport, with up to three daily departures to Denver International Airport. However, they stopped serving the airport in early November 2017 citing shortage of pilots \n\nThe airport has free long term parking, four major car rental companies at the terminal, and free WiFi in the terminal area.\n\nFour Corners Regional Airport was primarily served by the original Frontier Airlines and by Mesa Airlines which was founded in Farmington and had its headquarters there for many years before moving to Phoenix. The Farmington airport has also been served by Air Midwest, Aspen Airways, Pioneer Airlines, Trans-Colorado Airlines, Sun West Airlines, Rio Grande Air, America West Express, Continental Express, United Express, American Eagle, and US Airways Express. In the past, the airport was by far the second busiest in the state of New Mexico behind the Albuquerque International Sunport. In terms of 2013 enplanements, it is currently the fifth busiest airport in the state, behind Albuquerque International Sunport, Santa Fe Municipal Airport, Roswell International Air Center, and Lea County Regional Airport serving Hobbs. In recent years most regional airlines have converted to all jet aircraft and Farmington cannot economically handle jets as the airport sits on top of a plateau in which the runways cannot be extended. Therefore, the airport has seen a significant drop in traffic, much of it now utilizing the La Plata County Airport near Durango, Colorado.\n\nMonarch Airlines was the first air carrier to serve Farmington beginning in 1947 using Douglas DC-3 aircraft on flights to Albuquerque and to Denver and Salt Lake City that made several stops en route. Monarch and two other carriers all merged in 1950 to create the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986).\n\nFrontier Airlines (1950-1986) continued to serve Farmington with DC-3s through the 1950s and added flights to Phoenix making several en route stops as well. In 1958 Frontier created a mini hub at Farmington operating 13 flights per day with as many as five DC-3 aircraft on the ground at one time. Through the 1960s Frontier upgraded their aircraft with Convair 340 piston engine aircraft and later with Convair 580 turboprops. By 1981, Frontier had discontinued all flights to Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City; however, the flights to its Denver hub (with a fuel stop in Durango) were upgraded to Boeing 737-200 jetliners from 1982 through 1984. The Denver flights were then reverted to Convair 580 aircraft operated as Frontier Commuter before all service was discontinued in early 1985.\n\nAspen Airways first came to Farmington for a period in 1979 and flew Convair 580s nonstop to Denver and Albuquerque. The carrier returned to Farmington in 1983 with flights only to Denver and became a United Express affiliate in 1986. Aspen Airways introduced British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jets between Farmington and Denver with a stop in Durango beginning in 1985 but ended all flights in March, 1990 when the carrier was sold to Mesa Airlines.\n\nMesa Airlines, founded in Farmington, began in 1980 with service to Albuquerque using small Piper prop aircraft. Beechcraft 99, Beechcraft 1300 and Beechcraft 1900 turboprops were introduced in the mid 1980s and new service to Phoenix was added in 1985. Nonstops to Salt Lake City were also briefly operated in 1988. Flights to Denver began in April, 1990 when Mesa became a United Express affiliate after purchasing certain assets and routes of Aspen Airways. Larger Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia and de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 propjets were then acquired. In 1992 Mesa began another affiliation with America West Airlines and the Phoenix flights began operating as America West Express. Flights to Las Vegas were also briefly added and operated as America West Express in the mid 1990s. By this time Mesa was the backbone air carrier at Farmington operating over 30 departures per day at times amongst their three divisions. Mesa's independent flights to Albuquerque operated every hour. The Denver flights were discontinued in 1998 when Mesa lost its United Express affiliation to Great Lakes Airlines. Independent flights operated by Mesa Air to Albuquerque ran through 2007 and the America West Express flights to Phoenix ended in mid 2008. America West Airlines merged with US Airways in late 2007 and the Phoenix flights then began operating as US Airways Express shortly before being discontinued. Mesa has since grown into a much larger air carrier and now operates an all regional jet fleet flying for several major airlines via respective code sharing agreements. The carrier has not served Farmington since 2008.\n\nTrans-Colorado Airlines served Farmington from early 1986 through mid 1987 with flights to Denver and Albuquerque. The carrier became a Continental Express affiliate in mid 1986 and operated Convair 580 and Swearingen Metroliner propjets.\n\nRocky Mountain Airways served Farmington from mid 1990 through late 1991 also as Continental Express with flights to Denver. The carrier operated Beechcraft 1900 and ATR-42 aircraft.\n\nAmerican Eagle served Farmington from late 1994 through late 1995 with an eastbound flight to Lubbock and Dallas/Fort Worth and a westbound flight to Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Saab 340 and ATR-42 turboprop aircraft were used.\n\nGreat Lakes Airlines began serving Farmington in mid 1998 with Beechcraft 1900D flights to Denver. The carrier had received the United Express affiliation formerly held by Mesa Airlines. The United Express affiliation was discontinued in early 2002 but the carrier continued to operate under its own brand. New flights to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles were later added with one stop en route however these flights all operated on a temporary basis. In late 2016, some flights were upgraded to larger, 30-seat, Embraer Brasilia aircraft however all flights ended on October 30, 2017 leaving Farmington with no commercial air service.\n\nOther smaller commuter airlines that have served Farmington include:\nZia Airlines from 1978 through 1980 with flights to Santa Fe and Albuquerque using Cessna 402 and Handley Page Jetstream aircraft.\n\nSun West Airlines from 1980 through 1984 with flights to Albuquerque and Phoenix using Piper Navajo's and Beechcraft 99's.\nAir Midwest from 1982 through 1986 with flights to Albuquerque using Swearingen Metroliner's. Flights to Phoenix briefly operated in 1983.\n\nPioneer Airlines, first in 1982 with flights to Denver and again for a short period in the summer of 1983 with flights to both Albuquerque and Denver using Swearingen Metroliner and Beechcraft 99 aircraft.\nRio Grande Air briefly served the Four Corners Airport from Albuquerque in 2001 with Cessna 208 Caravan's.\n\nThe peak of Farmington's commercial air service occurred in the summer of 1983 when the city was served by six airlines simultaneously with a total of 38 departures per day, three of which were Frontier Airlines Boeing 737 jets. As of October 30, 2017, there has been no commercial flights at Farmington.\n\nFour Corners Regional Airport covers an area of which contains two asphalt paved runways:\n\nFor the 12-month period ending May 31, 2014, the airport had 35,479 aircraft operations, an average of 97 per day: 67% general aviation, 29% air taxi and 4% military. There are 126 aircraft based at this airport: 87% single-engine, 10% multi-engine, 3% jet, and >1% helicopter. The airport has one terminal for all arrivals and departures, as well as one FBO, Atlantic Aviation.\n\nThe data below lists annual total aircraft operations from 2009–2013 from the FAA's Air Traffic Activity System.

{"id": "2175469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175469", "title": "Non-line-of-sight propagation", "text": "Non-line-of-sight propagation\n\nNon-line-of-sight (NLOS) and near-line-of-sight are radio transmissions across a path that is partially obstructed, usually by a physical object in the innermost Fresnel zone.\n\nMany types of radio transmissions depend, to varying degrees, on line of sight (LOS) between the transmitter and receiver. Obstacles that commonly cause NLOS conditions include buildings, trees, hills, mountains, and, in some cases, high voltage electric power lines. Some of these obstructions reflect certain radio frequencies, while some simply absorb or garble the signals; but, in either case, they limit the use of many types of radio transmissions, especially when low on power budget.\n\nLower power levels at a receiver reduce the chance of successfully receiving a transmission. Low levels can be caused by at least three basic reasons: low transmit level, for example Wi-Fi power levels; far-away transmitter, such as 3G more than away or TV more than away; and obstruction between the transmitter and the receiver, leaving no clear path.\n\nNLOS lowers the effective received power. Near Line Of Sight can usually be dealt with using better antennas, but Non Line Of Sight is usually requires alternative paths or multipath propagation methods.\n\nHow to achieve effective NLOS networking has become one of the major questions of modern computer networking. Currently, the most common method for dealing with NLOS conditions on wireless computer networks is simply to circumvent the NLOS condition and place relays at additional locations, sending the content of the radio transmission around the obstructions. Some more advanced NLOS transmission schemes now use multipath signal propagation, bouncing the radio signal off other nearby objects to get to the receiver.\n\nNon-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) is a term often used in radio communications to describe a radio channel or link where there is no \"visual\" line of sight (LOS) between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. In this context LOS is taken\nThere are many electrical characteristics of the transmission media that affect the radio wave propagation and therefore the quality of operation of a radio channel, if it is possible at all, over an NLOS path.\n\nThe acronym NLOS has become more popular in the context of wireless local area networks (WLANs) and wireless metropolitan area networks such as WiMAX because the capability of such links to provide a reasonable level of NLOS coverage greatly improves their marketability and versatility in the typical urban environments where they are most frequently used. However NLOS contains many other subsets of radio communications.\n\nThe influence of a visual obstruction on a NLOS link may be anything from negligible to complete suppression. An example might apply to a LOS path between a television broadcast antenna and a roof mounted receiving antenna. If a cloud passed between the antennas the link could actually become NLOS but the quality of the radio channel could be virtually unaffected. If, instead, a large building was constructed in the path making it NLOS, the channel may be impossible to receive.\n\nBeyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) is a related term often used in the military to describe radio communications capabilities that link personnel or systems too distant or too fully obscured by terrain for LOS communications. These radios utilize active repeaters, groundwave propagation, tropospheric scatter links, and ionospheric propagation to extend communication ranges from a few miles to a few thousand miles.\n\nFrom Maxwell's equations we find that radio waves, as they exist in free space in the far field or \"Fraunhofer\" region behave as \"plane waves\". In plane waves the electric field, magnetic field and direction of propagation are mutually perpendicular. To understand the various mechanisms that allow successful radio communications over NLOS paths we must consider how such plane waves are affected by the object or objects that visually obstruct the otherwise LOS path between the antennas. It is understood that the terms radio far field waves and radio plane waves are interchangeable.\n\nBy definition, line of sight is the \"visual\" line of sight, that is determined by the ability of the average human eye to resolve a distant object. Our eyes are sensitive to light but optical wavelengths are very short compared to radio wavelengths. Optical wavelengths range from about 400 nanometer (nm) to 700 nm but radio wavelengths range from approximately 1 millimetre (mm) at 300 GHz to 30 kilometres (km) at 10 kHz. Even the shortest radio wavelength is therefore about 2000 times longer than the longest optical wavelength. For typical communications frequencies up to about 10 GHz, the difference is on the order of 60,000 times so it is not always reliable to compare visual obstructions, such as might suggest a NLOS path, with the same obstructions as they might affect a radio propagation path.\n\nNLOS links may either be simplex (transmission is in one direction only), duplex (transmission is in both directions simultaneously) or half-duplex (transmission is possible in both directions but not simultaneously). Under normal conditions, all radio links, including NLOSl are reciprocal—which means that the effects of the propagation conditions on the radio channel are identical whether it operates in simplex, duplex, or half-duplex. However, propagation conditions on different frequencies are different, so traditional duplex with different uplink and downlink frequencies is not necessarily reciprocal.\n\nIn general, the way a plane wave is affected by an obstruction depends on the size of the obstruction relative to its wavelength and the electrical properties of the obstruction. For example, a hot air balloon with multi-wavelength dimensions passing between the transmit and receive antennas could be a significant visual obstruction but is unlikely to affect the NLOS radio propagation much assuming it is constructed from fabric and full of hot air, both of which are good insulators. Conversely, a metal obstruction of dimensions comparable to a wavelength would cause significant reflections. When considering obstruction size, we assume its electrical properties are the most common intermediate or lossy type.\n\nBroadly, there are three approximate sizes of obstruction in relationship to a wavelength to consider in a possible NLOS path—those that are:\n\n\nIf the obstruction dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident plane wave, the wave is essentially unaffected. For example, low frequency (LF) broadcasts, also known as long waves, at about 200 kHz has a wavelength of 1500 m and is not significantly affected by most average size buildings, which are much smaller.\n\nIf the obstruction dimensions are of the same order as a wavelength, there is a degree of diffraction around the obstruction and possibly some transmission through it. The incident radio wave could be slightly attenuated and there might be some interaction between the diffracted wavefronts.\n\nIf the obstruction has dimensions of many wavelengths, the incident plane waves depend heavily on the electrical properties of the material that forms the obstruction.\n\nThe electrical properties of the material forming an obstruction to radio waves could range from a perfect conductor at one extreme to a perfect insulator at the other. Most materials have both conductor and insulator properties. They may be mixed: for example, many NLOS paths result from the LOS path being obstructed by reinforced concrete buildings constructed from concrete and steel. Concrete is quite a good insulator when dry and steel is a good conductor. Alternatively the material may be a homogeneous \"lossy\" material.\n\nThe parameter that describes to what degree a material is a conductor or insulator is known as formula_1, or the \"loss tangent\", given by \nwhere\n\nand\n\nIf formula_8 the material is a good conductor or a poor insulator and substantially \"reflects\" the radio waves that are incident upon it with almost the same power. Therefore, virtually no RF power is absorbed by the material itself and virtually none is transmitted, even if it is very thin. All metals are good conductors and there are of course many examples that cause significant reflections of radio waves in the urban environment, for example bridges, metal clad buildings, storage warehouses, aircraft and electrical power transmission towers or pylons.\n\nIf formula_9 the material is a good insulator (or dielectric) or a poor conductor and substantially \"transmit\" waves that are incident upon it. Virtually no RF power is absorbed but some can be reflected at its boundaries depending on its relative permittivity compared to that of free space, which is unity. This uses the concept of intrinsic impedance, which is described below. There are few large physical objects that are also good insulators, with the interesting exception of fresh water icebergs but these do not usually feature in most urban environments. However large volumes of gas generally behave as dielectrics. Examples of these are regions of the Earths atmosphere, which gradually reduce in density at increasing altitudes up to 10 to 20 km. At greater altitudes from about 50 km to 200 km various ionospheric layers also behave like dielectrics and are heavily dependent on the influence of the Sun. Ionospheric layers are not gases but plasmas.\n\nEven if an obstruction is a perfect insulator, it may have some reflective properties on account of its relative permittivity formula_7 differing from that of the atmosphere. Electrical materials through which plane waves may propagate have a property called intrinsic impedance (formula_11) or electromagnetic impedance, which is analogous to the characteristic impedance of a cable in transmission line theory. The intrinsic impedance of a homogeneous material is given by:\n\nwhere\n\nFor free space formula_19 and formula_20, therefore the intrinsic impedance of free space formula_21 is given by\n\nwhich evaluates to approximately 377 formula_23.\n\nIn an analogy of plane wave theory and transmission line theory, the definition of reflection coefficient formula_24 is a measure of the level of reflection normally at the boundary when a plane wave passes from one dielectric medium to another. For example, if the intrinsic impedance of the first and second media were formula_25 and formula_26 respectively, the reflection coefficient of medium 2 relative to 1, formula_27, is given by:\n\nThe logarithmic measure in decibels (formula_29) of how the transmitted RF signal over the NLOS link is affected by such a reflection is given by:\n\nformula_30\n\nMost materials of the type affecting radio wave transmission over NLOS links are intermediate: they are neither good insulators nor good conductors. Radio waves incident upon an obstruction comprising a thin intermediate material are partly reflected at both the incident and exit boundaries and partly absorbed, depending on the thickness. If the obstruction is thick enough the radio wave might be completely absorbed. Because of the absorption, these are often called lossy materials, although the degree of loss is usually extremely variable and often very dependent on the level of moisture present. They are often heterogeneous and comprise a mixture of materials with various degrees of conductor and insulator properties. Such examples are hills, valley sides, mountains (with substantial vegetation) and buildings constructed from stone, brick or concrete but without reinforced steel. The thicker they are the greater the loss. For example, a wall absorbs much less RF power from a normally incident wave than a building constructed from the same material.\n\nPassive random reflections are achieved when plane waves are subject to one or more reflective paths around an object that makes an otherwise LOS radio path into NLOS. The reflective paths might be caused by various objects that could either be metallic (very good conductors such as a steel bridge or an airplane) or relatively good conductors to plane waves such as large expanses of concrete building sides, walls etc. Sometimes this is considered a \"brute force\" method because, on each reflection the plane wave undergoes a transmission loss that must be compensated for by a higher output power from the transmit antenna compared to if the link had been LOS. However the technique is cheap and easy to employ and passive random reflections are widely exploited in urban areas to achieve NLOS. Communication services that use passive reflections include WiFi, WiMax, WiMAX MIMO, mobile (cellular) communications and terrestrial broadcast to urban areas.\n\nPassive repeaters may be used to achieve NLOS links by deliberately installing a precisely designed reflector at a critical position to provide a path around the obstruction. However they are unacceptable in most urban environments due to the bulky reflector requiring critical positioning at perhaps an inaccessible location or at one not acceptable to the planning authorities or the owner of the building. Passive reflector NLOS links also incur substantial loss due to the received signal being a 'double inverse-square law' function of the transmit signal, one for each hop from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna. However, they have been successfully used in rural mountainous areas to extend the range of LOS microwave links around mountains, thus creating NLOS links. In such cases the installation of the more usual active repeater was usually not possible due to problems in obtaining a suitable power supply.\n\nAn active repeater is a powered piece of equipment essentially comprising a receiving antenna, a receiver, a transmitter and a transmitting antenna. If the ends of the NLOS link are at positions A and C, the repeater is located at position B where links A-B and B-C are in fact LOS. The active repeater may simply amplify the received signal and re-transmit it un-altered at either the same frequency or a different frequency. The former case is simpler and cheaper but requires good isolation between two antennas to avoid feedback, however it does mean that the end of the NLOS link at A or C does not require to change the receive frequency from that used for a LOS link. A typical application might be to repeat or re-broadcast signals for vehicles using car radios in tunnels. A repeater that changes frequency would avoid any feedback problems but would be more difficult to design and expensive and it would require a receiver to change frequency when moving from the LOS to the NLOS zone.\n\nA communications satellite is an example of an active repeater that does change frequency. Communications satellites, in most cases, are in geosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 22,300 miles (35,000 km) above the Equator.\n\nApplication of the Poynting Vector to vertically polarized plane waves at LF (30 kHz to 300 kHz) and VLF (3 kHz to 30 kHz) indicates that a component of the field is propagated a few metres into the surface of the Earth. The propagation is very low loss and communications over thousands of miles over NLOS links is possible. However, such low frequencies by definition (Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem) are very low bandwidth, so this type of communication is not widely used.\n\nA tropospheric scatter NLOS link typically operates at a few gigahertz using potentially very high transmit powers (typically 3 kW to 30 kW, depending on conditions), very sensitive receivers and very high gain, usually fixed, large reflector antennas. The transmit beam is directed into the troposphere just above the horizon with sufficient power flux density that gas and water vapour molecules cause scattering in a region in the beam path known as the scatter volume. Some components of the scattered energy travel in the direction of the receiver antennas and form the receive signal. Since there are very many particles to cause scattering in this region, the Rayleigh fading statistical model may usefully predict behaviour and performance in this kind of system.\n\nThe obstruction that creates an NLOS link may be the Earth itself, such as would exist if the other end of the link was beyond the optical horizon. A very useful property of the Earth's atmosphere is that, on average, the density of air gas molecules reduces as the altitude increases up to approximately 30 km. Its relative permittivity or dielectric constant reduces steadily from about 1.00536 at the Earth's surface. To model the change in refractive index with altitude, the atmosphere may be approximated to many thin air layers, each of which has a slightly smaller refractive index than the one below. The trajectory of radio waves progressing through such an atmosphere model at each interface, is analogous to optical beams passing from one optical medium to another as predicted by Snell's Law. When the beam passes from a higher to lower refractive index it tends to get bent or refracted away from the normal at the boundary according to Snell's Law. When the curvature of the Earth is taken into account it is found that, on average, radio waves whose initial trajectory is towards the optical horizon follows a path that does not return to the Earth's surface at the horizon, but slightly beyond it. The distance from the transmit antenna to where it does return is approximately equivalent to the optical horizon, \"had the Earth's radius been 4/3 of its actual value\". The '4/3 Earth's radius' is a useful rule of thumb to the radio communication engineers when designing such a NLOS link.\n\nThe 4/3 Earth radius rule of thumb is an average for the Earth's atmosphere assuming it is reasonably homogenised, absent of temperature inversion layers or unusual meteorological conditions. NLOS links that exploit atmospheric refraction typically operate at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands, including FM and TV terrestrial broadcast services.\n\nThe phenomenon described above that the atmospheric refractive index, relative permittivity or dielectric constant gradually reduces with increasing height is on account of the reduction of the atmospheric air density with increasing height. Air density is also a function of temperature, which ordinarily also reduces with increasing height. However, these are only average conditions; local meteorological conditions can create phenomena such as temperature inversion layers where a warm layer of air settles above a cool layer. At the interface between them exists a relatively abrupt change in refractive index from a smaller value in the cool layer to a larger value in the warm layer. By analogy with the optical Snell's Law, this can cause significant reflections of radio waves back towards the Earth's surface where they are further reflected, thus causing a ducting effect. The result is that radio waves can propagate well beyond their intended service area with less than normal attenuation. This effect is only apparent in the VHF and UHF spectra and is often exploited by amateur radio enthusiasts to achieve communications over abnormally long distances for the frequencies involved. For commercial communication services it cannot be exploited because it is unreliable (the conditions can form and disperse in minutes) and it can cause interference well outside of the normal service area.\n\nTemperature inversion and anomalous propagation can occur at most latitudes but they are more common in tropical climates than temperate climates, usually associated with high pressure areas (anticyclones).\n\nThe mechanism of ionospheric propagation in supporting NLOS links is similar to that for atmospheric refraction but, in this case, the radio wave refraction occurs not in the atmosphere but in the ionosphere at much greater altitudes. Like its tropospheric counterpart, ionospheric propagation can sometimes be statistically modelled using Rayleigh fading.\n\nThe ionosphere extends from altitudes of approximately 50 km to 400 km and is divided into distinct plasma layers denoted D, E, F1, and F2 in increasing altitude. Refraction of radio waves by the ionosphere rather than the atmosphere can therefore allow NLOS links of much greater distance for just one refraction path or 'hop' via one of the layers. Under certain conditions radio waves that have undergone one hop may reflect off the Earth's surface and experience more hops, so increasing the range. The positions of these and their ion densities are significantly controlled by the Sun's incident radiation and therefore change diurnally, seasonally and during Sun spot activity. The initial discovery that radio waves could travel beyond the horizon by Marconi in the early 20th century prompted extensive studies of ionospheric propagation for the next 50 years or so, which have yielded various HF link channel prediction tables and charts.\n\nFrequencies that are affected by ionospheric propagation range from approximately 500 kHz to 50 MHz but the majority of such NLOS links operate in the 'short wave' or high frequency (HF) frequency bands between 3 MHz and 30 MHz.\n\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, alternative means of communicating over large NLOS distances were developed such as satellite communications and submarine optical fiber, both of which potentially carry much larger bandwidths than HF and are much more reliable. Despite their limitations, HF communications only need relatively cheap, crude equipment and antennas so they are mostly used as backups to main communications systems and in sparsely populated remote areas where other methods of communication are not cost effective.\n\nIf an object that changes a LOS link to NLOS is not a good conductor but an intermediate material, it absorbs some of the RF power incident upon it. However, if it has finite thickness the absorption is also finite and the resulting attenuation of the radio waves may be tolerable and an NLOS link may be set up using radio waves that actually pass through the material. As an example, wireless local area networks (WLANs) often use finite absorption NLOS links to communicate between a WLAN access point and WLAN client(s) in the typical office environment. The radio frequencies used, typically a few gigahertz (GHz) normally passes through a few thin office walls and partitions with tolerable attenuation. After many such walls though or after a few thick concrete or similar (non-metallic) walls the NLOS link becomes unworkable.\n\nEarth–Moon–Earth communication, Meteor burst communications, and Sporadic E propagation are also other methods of achieving communications past the radio horizon.\n\nIn most of the recent localization systems, it is assumed that the received signals propagate through a LOS path. However, infringement of this assumption can result in inaccurate positioning data. For Time of Arrival based localization system, the emitted signal can only arrive at the receiver through its NLOS paths. The NLOS error is defined as the extra distance travelled by the received signal with respect to the LOS path. The NLOS error is always positively biased with the magnitude dependent on the propagation environment.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

Established as a top local lounge act, Hughes and Stephens were eventually spotted in a Dallas club by Al Williams - leader of the Four Step Brothers dance troupe - who signed as the duo's manager successfully transferring them to the Chicago nightclub circuit. In 1965 Hughes made her recording debut with an album focused on standards - which billed Hughes as Rheta Hughes and featured Tennyson Stephens - entitled \"Introducing An Electrifying New Star\" recorded with producer Ralph Bass for Columbia Records, who would release three singles by Hughes in 1967-68 all produced by Howard Roberts (Hughes' Columbia recording sessions all took place in New York City). Continuing to play nightclubs, Hughes was discovered by Bill Cosby who caught her act at the Redd Foxx Club in Los Angeles, with Hughes resultantly being signed to Tetragrammaton Records, the label Cosby had recently co-founded. After her label debut: \"You're Doing It With Her - When It Should Be Me\", almost reached the R&B Top 40 in the autumn of 1968, Hughes scored her career record with a mid-tempo R&B rendition of the Doors hit \"Light My Fire\" which reached #36 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart in February 1969 with the track just falling short of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 peaking at #102 on the \"Bubbling Under...\" chart (\"Record World\", whose R&B chart afforded Hughes' \"Light My Fire\" a #26 peak, ranked the track in its 100 Top Pops singles chart with a peak of #78).\n\nHughes' two Tetragammraton singles were included on a 1969 album release entitled \"Re-Light My Fire\" from which two further singles were released without charting.\n\nHughes had no further releases on Tetragammraton before the label folded in 1971 but was featured on the track \"Mother's Prayer\" on the 1971 album \"As Serious as a Heart-Attack\" by Melvin Van Peebles, with Hughes also accruing an impressive résumé as a session singer with her vocalizing on the 1974 #1 Roberta Flack hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" earning Hughes a gold record: Hughes session work résumé also includes the Van Dyke Parks album \"Discover America\" (1972), the Buffy Sainte-Marie album \"Moonshot\" (1972), the 1973 self-titled album by Brenda Patterson, the Bette Midler album \"Songs for the New Depression\" (1976), the 1976 self-titled album by Essra Mohawk and the Bobby Rydell album \"Born With a Smile\" (1976): a chorale member on the 1976 album \"Speak No Evil\" by Buddy Rich & the Big Band Machine, Hughes also vocalized on the track \"The Circle\" on the 1977 album \"Loading Zone\" () by guitarist Roy Buchanan. In the early 1970s Hughes branched out into acting, her first evident credit being the 1971 blaxploitation film \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" whose creator Melvin Van Peebles recruited Hughes for his stage musical \"Don't Play Us Cheap\" which afforded Hughes her Broadway in 1972, which year Hughes would reprise her stage role in the play's 1972 filmation. Hughes had her second Broadway tenure in the musical \"Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope\" in which she impressed audience-member Harry Belafonte: subsequent to performing in Paul Sills' stage adaptation of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" at the 1973 Festival dei Due Mondi in Umbria Hughes was recruited by Belafonte to serve as second vocalist on his six-month North American tour in 1974, and then again on his eight-month global tour in 1976.\n\nAfter some time away from performing tending her ailing mother in Dallas, Hughes led the national touring company of \"Bubbling Brown Sugar\" from July 1977 to May 1978: also in 1978 an uncredited Hughes was featured in the chorale for the 1978 film musical \"The Wiz\". In March 1979 Hughes was cast as second lead in an upcoming Broadway show \"Got Tu Go Disco\" - highly touted as \"the first disco musical\" - with Hughes casting resulting in her being signed as a recording artist by disco-oriented Aria Productions whose leader Kenny Lehman was \"Got Tu...\"s musical director/supervisor. Although \"Got Tu...\" would not noticeably last beyond its June 1979 opening Lehman would in fact produce Hughes' third album: \"Starpiece\", released in 1980, which year also saw Hughes co-starring in the original off-Broadway musical \"Paris Lights\" as Josephine Baker. \n\nIn 1981 Hughes co-starred in the Ford's Theater (D.C.) revival of the 1961 off-Broadway musical \"Black Nativity\", performed in an off-Broadway revival of the musical \"Raisin\" mounted at the Equity Library Theatre, and play the second female lead Missy in a one-off staging of \"Purlie\" at the Lehman College Center for the Performing Arts taped for broadcast on Showtime. In 1982 - in a rare non-musical stage role - Hughes portrayed the maid in an all-black version of \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" taped for the MT&R and broadcast by ABC-TV.\n\nDuring a 1983 tenure in the Broadway hit musical \"Dreamgirls\" (as a chorus line member and understudy for the role of \"Dreamgirl\" Lorrell), Hughes was cast for the lead role in the upcoming \"Amen Corner\", a highly touted new musical which - despite a promising \"try-out\" September engagement at Ford's Theater (D.C.) - would close less than five weeks subsequent to its inaugural November 1, 1983 preview, although Hughes performance would earn a Tony Award nomination in the category Best Actress in a Musical: Hughes, who had been featured on the cast album for the stage musical \"Don't Play Us Cheap\", would be featured on the cast album recorded for \"Amen Corner\". Also in 1983 Hughes recorded two dance tracks for Kenny Lehman's Aria Productions: \"Angel Man (G.A.)\" and \"Crisis\", which ranked on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart with respective peaks of #1 and #20, with \"Angel Man\" becoming a minor R&B chart hit (#88). And Hughes would reprise her \"Black Nativity\" role when that musical was presented before Pope John Paul II in a December 23, 1983 performance in Vatican City. Hughes later stage musical résumé would include a 1984 off-Broadway revival of \"Take Me Along\", a 1985 off-off-Broadway turn in the non-musical drama \"Long Time Since Yesterday\", the 1987 national tour of \"Dreamgirls\" (reprising her Broadway role), and \"God's Trombones!\" a 1989 original off Broadway musical inspired by James Weldon Johnson's inspirational verse classic \"God's Trombones\": also Hughes participated in the Kool Jazz Festival's salute to Ethel Waters held at Avery Fisher Hall (UWS) June 27, 1985. In May 1988 Hughes appeared in the Fox Theater (Atlanta) premiere production \"Moms\", supporting Clarice Taylor who portrayed Moms Mabley: the production would subsequently play engagements in Cleveland and Philadelphia. Hughes continued to accrue occasional screen credits with a co-starring role in the 1985 exploitation film \"Tenement\" and a supporting role in the mainstream but barely-released 1986 movie \"A Killing Affair\", and also guest roles on the TV series \"Knightwatch\" and \"Law & Order\" in respectively 1988 and 1991.\n\nIn the summer of 1991 Hughes accepted an offer to co-star as Josephine Baker's mother in a new Dutch stage musical whose director: Billy Wilson, had worked (as choreographer) with Hughes in the 1977-78 national tour of \"Bubbling Brown Sugar\": \"Josephine: the Musical\" began its premiere run at the Luxor Theatre (Rotterdam) () September 19, 1991 with subsequent engagements in other European venues. Hughes remained in the Netherlands for several years residing in Amsterdam and appearing in local musical stage productions including \"Bubbling Brown Sugar\" (1993) and the gospel music revue \"The Glory of Gospel\" (1996), being featured on the cast albums for the latter two productions as she had been with \"Josephine...\". \n\nIn 2008 Hughes returned to session singing for the album \"Subway Silence\" by Dutch vocalist Giovanca ().\n\nIn recent years Hughes has resided in Dallas tending her mother.\n\n"}

Associated with the software release life cycle, it was said by Boris Debic of Google Inc. that release engineering is to software engineering as manufacturing is to an industrial process: \n\nRelease engineering is the difference between manufacturing software in small teams or startups and manufacturing software in an industrial way that is repeatable, gives predictable results,\nand scales well. These industrial style practices not only contribute to the growth of a company but also are\nkey factors in enabling growth.\n\nThe importance of release engineering in enabling growth of a technology company has been repeatedly argued by John O'Duinn and Bram Adams. While it is not the goal of release engineering to encumber software development with a process overlay, it is often seen as a sign of organizational and developmental maturity.\n\nModern release engineering is concerned with several aspects of software production:\n\nRelease engineering is often the integration hub for more complex software development teams, sitting at the cross between development, product management, quality assurance and other engineering efforts, also known as DevOps. Release engineering teams are often cast in the role of gatekeepers (e.g. at Facebook, Google, Microsoft) for certain critical products where their judgement forms a parallel line of responsibility and authority in relation to production releases (pushes).\n\nFrequently, tracking of changes in a configuration management system or revision control system is part of the domain of the release engineer. The responsibility for creating and applying a version numbering scheme into software—and tracking that number back to the specific source files to which it applies—often falls onto the release engineer. Producing or improving automation in software production is usually a goal of the release engineer. Gathering, tracking, and supplying all the tools that are required to develop and build a particular piece of software may be a release engineering task, in order to reliably reproduce or maintain software years after its initial release to customers.\n\nWhile most software engineers, or software developers, do many or all of the above as a course of their work, in larger organizations the specialty of the release engineer can be applied to coordinate disparate source trees, projects, teams, and components. This frees the developers to implement features in the software and also frees the quality assurance engineers to more broadly and deeply test the produced software.\n\nThe release engineer may provide software, services, or both to software engineering and software quality assurance teams. The software provided may build tools, assembly, or other reorganization scripts which take compilation output and place them into a pre-defined tree structure, and even to the authoring and creation of installers for use by test teams or by the ultimate consumer of the software. The services provided may include software build (compilation) automation, automated test integration, results reporting, and production of or preparation for software delivery systems—e.g., in the form of electronic media (CDs, DVDs) or electronic software distribution mechanisms.\n\n\n"}

The complete recording from October 31, 1964 \"Halloween\" show at Philharmonic Hall in Manhattan by Bob Dylan, it had been widely circulated on pirate tapes for decades.\n\nThe set list was dominated by Dylan’s protest songs, including \"The Times They Are a-Changin’,\" \"A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall,\" and \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\". Joan Baez, a major supporter of Dylan's in his early career, duets with Dylan on three songs, as well as singing another alone (\"Silver Dagger\", to which Dylan contributes harmonica). However, Dylan performed these songs alongside early versions of three songs from the soon-to-be-recorded \"Bringing It All Back Home\". New compositions like \"It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" showed Dylan moving in a new direction, becoming more immersed in evocative, stream-of-consciousness lyrics and moving away from social, topical songwriting. Even as he was moving in this new direction, Dylan was still portrayed as a symbol of the civil rights and anti-war movements, and the Halloween concert of 1964 caught Dylan in transition.\n\nThe album debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart on April 17, 2004 at number 28 and spent four weeks on the chart.

Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman. The first meeting (April 17, 1865) saw Sherman agreeing to certain political demands by the Confederates, which were promptly rejected by the Union cabinet in Washington. Another meeting had to be held (April 26) to agree on military terms only, in line with Robert E. Lee’s recent surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. This effectively ended the war.\n\nAfter Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, he turned north through the Carolinas for the Carolinas Campaign. Confederate President Jefferson Davis met his General Joseph E. Johnston in Greensboro, North Carolina, while Sherman had stopped in Raleigh.\n\nThough Davis wished strongly to continue the war, Johnston sent a courier to the Union troops encamped at Morrisville Station, with a message to General Sherman, offering a meeting between the lines to discuss a truce. Johnston's army was still an active fighting force that, unlike Robert E. Lee's beleaguered Army of Northern Virginia, which had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, had an available line of retreat along which, according to Davis, \"ample supplies\" had been placed.\n\nJohnston, escorted by a detachment of about 60 troopers of the 5th South Carolina Cavalry Regiment, traveled east along the Hillsborough Road toward Durham Station in Durham, Durham County. Sherman was riding west to meet him, with an escort of 200 men from the 9th and 13th Pennsylvania, 8th Indiana and 2nd Kentucky Cavalry. The farm of James and Nancy Bennett at Bennett Place, sometimes known as Bennett Farm, was a convenient place for privacy.\n\nThe first day's discussion (April 17) was intensified by the telegram Sherman handed to Johnston, informing of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. They met the following day, April 18, and signed terms of surrender. However, on April 24, Grant arrived and informed Sherman that the terms had been rejected by the presidential cabinet in Washington because they exceeded the terms that Grant had given Lee and included civil matters. The opposing generals met again on April 26, 1865, and with the assistance of Gen. John M. Schofield, agreed to new terms omitting the controversial sections. The agreement disbanded all active Confederate forces in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, totaling 89,270 soldiers, which was the largest group to surrender during the Civil War.\n\nJames and Nancy Bennett were like many families who suffered tremendously during the four years of war. They lost a son and son-in-law: Lorenzo, who served in the 27th North Carolina, buried in Winchester, Virginia; and their daughter Eliza's husband, Robert Duke, who died in a Confederate Army hospital and is buried in Lynchburg, Virginia. Their 3rd child, Alfonzo, was not in the war but died during the Civil War years (1864). The Bennetts never fully recovered from the war, and in 1878, James Bennett died and the family moved to the new community of Durham to begin a life without him.\n\nThe Bennett Farm was abandoned and fell into ruin; a fire finally destroying the farmhouse in 1921. In 1923 the Unity monument was dedicated on the site. In 1960 the Bennett Farm site was fully reclaimed and restored by local preservationists. It was then turned over to the State of North Carolina and made a state historic site.\n\nThe difficulty in reaching a surrender agreement lay in part in Johnston's desire, influenced by President Davis, for more than the purely military surrender that Major General Sherman offered. Sherman's original terms matched those offered by Lt. General Ulysses S. Grant to General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, but Johnston along with General John C. Breckinridge, also serving as Secretary of War for the Confederacy, insisted on resolutions of political issues, including the reestablishment of state governments, return of some weapons to state arsenals and civil rights after the war. Sherman, in accordance with Lincoln's stated overall wishes for a compassionate and forgiving end to the war, agreed on terms that included the political issues. Sherman was unaware that on March 3, Lincoln had given Grant orders to only discuss military matters with Lee. Lincoln was then assassinated. \n\nAfter reading the original Sherman-Johnston terms of surrender, United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, taking a position in accordance with Lincoln's instructions to Grant, persuaded a unanimous Federal cabinet to reject the terms. Sherman was instructed to call Johnston back to the table and request the military surrender of Johnston's army. In response, Jefferson Davis ordered Johnston to disband his infantry and escape with his mounted troops. However, Johnston disobeyed his orders and agreed to meet again with Major General Sherman at Bennett Farm. The second negotiation session took place on April 26, 1865. The opposing generals agreed to new military surrender terms that were substantially identical to the ones Grant had given to Lee, supplemented with corollary implementation terms written by Schofield pertaining to rations and return of the paroled soldiers to their homes. The surrender agreement ended the war for the 89,270 soldiers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Three more primary surrenders would follow in Citronelle, Alabama; Galveston, Texas; and Doaksville, Oklahoma.\n\nThe home of James and Nancy Bennett, simple yeoman farmers, served as the site of the surrender negotiations between Major General William T. Sherman and General Joseph E. Johnston April 17, 18 and 26, 1865. It was the largest surrender of the American Civil War, officially ending the fighting in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The original house burned in 1921 and was reconstructed as a two-story log structure covered by weatherboards with a gable roof and a shed addition. Also on the property are a log kitchen and smokehouse.\n\nIn 1923, the Unity Monument was placed on the site to commemorate this historic event. Among the many contributors to the preservation of this historic landmark were the Duke, Everett, and Morgan families.\n\nToday, Bennett Place State Historic Site belongs to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and is located in the west end of Durham, near Duke University. The site is open to the public, Tuesday-Saturday, 9am-5pm, with a visitor center, museum, theater presentation, \"Dawn of Peace\", research library, gift shop, and the reconstruction of the Bennett Farm. Living history programs and the commemoration of the surrender take place throughout the year. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\n\nOn April 15, 2010, the Bennett Place Historic Site unveiled a new painting by renowned Civil War artist Dan Nance, entitled \"The First Meeting\". On the same day, the site gave its first William Vatavuk Scholarship, a yearly scholarship for students who wish to major in history in college. The scholarship honors the late William Vatavuk, who wrote \"Dawn of Peace\", the first guidebook for the historic site.\n\n\n\n"}

Those expressions are then set equal to the sample moments. The number of such equations is the same as the number of parameters to be estimated. Those equations are then solved for the parameters of interest. The solutions are estimates of those parameters. \n\nThe method of moments was introduced by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1887 in the proof of the central limit theorem. The idea of matching empirical moments of a distribution to the population moments dates back at least to Pearson.\n\nSuppose that the problem is to estimate formula_1 unknown parameters formula_2 characterizing the distribution formula_3 of the random variable formula_4. Suppose the first formula_1 moments of the true distribution (the \"population moments\") can be expressed as functions of the formula_6s:\n\nSuppose a sample of size formula_8 is drawn, resulting in the values formula_9. For formula_10, let \nbe the \"j\"-th sample moment, an estimate of formula_12. The method of moments estimator for formula_13 denoted by formula_14 is defined as the solution (if there is one) to the equations: \n\nThe method of moments is fairly simple and yields consistent estimators (under very weak assumptions), though these estimators are often biased.\n\nIn some respects, when estimating parameters of a known family of probability distributions, this method was superseded by Fisher's method of maximum likelihood, because maximum likelihood estimators have higher probability of being close to the quantities to be estimated and are more often unbiased.\n\nHowever, in some cases the likelihood equations may be intractable without computers, whereas the method-of-moments estimators can be quickly and easily calculated by hand.\n\nEstimates by the method of moments may be used as the first approximation to the solutions of the likelihood equations, and successive improved approximations may then be found by the Newton–Raphson method. In this way the method of moments can assist in finding maximum likelihood estimates.\n\nIn some cases, infrequent with large samples but not so infrequent with small samples, the estimates given by the method of moments are outside of the parameter space (as shown in the example below); it does not make sense to rely on them then. That problem never arises in the method of maximum likelihood. Also, estimates by the method of moments are not necessarily sufficient statistics, i.e., they sometimes fail to take into account all relevant information in the sample.\n\nWhen estimating other structural parameters (e.g., parameters of a utility function, instead of parameters of a known probability distribution), appropriate probability distributions may not be known, and moment-based estimates may be preferred to maximum likelihood estimation.\n\nAn example application of the method of moments is to estimate polynomial probability density distributions. In this case, an approximate polynomial of order formula_16 is defined on an interval formula_17. The method of moments then yields a system of equations, whose solution involves the inversion of a Hankel matrix.\n\nConsider the uniform distribution on the interval formula_17, formula_19. If formula_20 then we have\n\nSolving these equations gives\n\nGiven a set of samples formula_25 we can use the sample moments formula_26 and formula_27 in these formulae in order to estimate formula_28 and formula_29.\n\nNote, however, that this method can produce inconsistent results in some cases. For example, the set of samples formula_30 results in the estimate formula_31 even though formula_32 and so it is impossible for the set formula_30 to have been drawn from formula_34 in this case.\n\n"}

It consists of a pattern of bright \"spokes\" on a dark background that radiate from a common center and become wider as they get further from it. In concept, the spokes only meet at the exact center of the star – the spokes, and the gaps between them, become narrower the closer to the center one looks, but they never touch except at the center. When printed or displayed on a device with limited resolution, however, the spokes touch at some distance from the center. The smallest gap visible is limited by the smallest dot of ink the printer can produce, making the Siemens star a useful tool for comparing two printers' resolutions (DPI). Similarly, it can be applied to a camera's optical resolution by taking photographs of a Siemens star printed at high resolution and comparing photographs from different cameras, to see which retained the center detail the closest.\nIn the field of video production, where it is often called a back focus chart, the Siemens star is widely used to adjust the back focus of removable lenses. It is also used during film or video shoots to help setting the focus in special situations.\n\nSiemens stars are similar to the sunburst pattern used as a background in graphic design, as in the Japanese Naval Ensign, Russian Air Force flag and Jordanian Royal Standard. They are useful in drawing the eye to a point on the page.\nUnder optical blur from defocus, a Siemens star (like any periodic pattern) gives rise to the phenomenon of \"spurious resolution\" above the resolution limit, i.e. toward the center of the Siemens star. (Spurious resolution appears similar to aliasing, but it is a purely optical phenomenon, so it occurs without need of pixels.) This results in inverted polarity of the stripe pattern: black stripes appear in the place of white stripes and vice versa (and further polarity inversions occur further inward).

It is a hemicellulose component in the cell walls of some plant species. Glucomannan is a food additive used as an emulsifier and thickener. \n\nProducts containing glucomannan, under a variety of brand names, are marketed as dietary supplements with claims they can relieve constipation and help lower cholesterol levels. Since 2010 they are legally marketed in Europe as helping with weight loss for people who are overweight and eating a diet with restricted calories, but as of 2014 the evidence did not support this effect. \n\nSupplements containing glucomannans pose a risk for choking and bowel obstruction if they are not taken with sufficient water. Other adverse effects include diarrhea, belching, and bloating; in one study people taking glucomannans had higher triglyceride levels. \n\nGlucomannans are also used to supplement animal feed for farmed animals, to help the animals gain weight more quickly.\n\nGlucomannan is mainly a straight-chain polymer, with a small amount of branching. The component sugars are β-(1→4)-linked -mannose and -glucose in a ratio of 1.6:1. The degree of branching is about 8% through β-(1→6)-glucosyl linkages.\n\nGlucomannan with α-(1→6)-linked galactose units in side branches is called galactoglucomannan.\n\nIn the yeast cell wall, mannan oligosaccharides are present in complex molecules that are linked to the protein moiety. There are two main locations of mannan oligosaccharides in the surface area of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" cell wall.\n\nThey can be attached to the cell wall proteins as part of –O and –N glycosyl groups and also constitute elements of large α-D-mannanose polysaccharides (α-D-Mannans), which are built of α-(1,2)- and α-(1,3)- D-mannose branches (from 1 to 5 rings long), which are attached to long α-(1,6)-D-mannose chains.\n\nThis specific combination of various functionalities involves mannan oligosaccharides-protein conjugates and highly hydrophilic and structurally variable 'brush-like' mannan oligosaccharides structures that can fit to various receptors of animal digestive tracts, and to the receptors on the surface of bacterial membranes, impacts these molecules bioactivity. Mannan oligosaccharides-protein conjugates are involved in interactions with the animal's immune system and as result enhance immune system activity. They also play a role in animal antioxidant and antimutagenic defense.\n\nGlucomannan comprises 40% by dry weight of the roots, or corm, of the konjac plant. Another culinary source is salep, ground from the roots of certain orchids and used in Greek and Turkish cuisine. However, these orchid species are protected in the whole EU and the trade of salep is strictly forbidden. Glucomannan is also a hemicellulose that is present in large amounts in the wood of conifers and in smaller amounts in the wood of dicotyledons. Glucomannan is also a constituent of bacterial, plant and yeast cell wall with differences in the branches or glycosidic linkages in the linear structure.\n\nGlucomannan is a food additive used as an emulsifier and thickener with the E number E425(ii).\n\nGlucomannan-rich salep powder is responsible for the unique textural properties of salep dondurma, a mastic-flavored stretchable and chewy ice cream of Turkish origin.\n\nGlucomannan is an ingredient in a variety of dietary supplement products marketed with claims that they aid in weight loss, but medical research has found no good evidence to support its use for this purpose. The claim is that it makes a gel when mixed with water, which can take up space in the stomach and linger there longer than water alone would, inducing a person to feel full after having eaten a smaller amount of food.\n\nIn Europe and Canada, glucomannan dietary supplements can be marketed with claims to lower cholesterol levels and to relieve constipation.\n\nA health advisory was released by Health Canada stating the following: \"Natural health products containing the ingredient glucomannan in tablet, capsule or powder form, which are currently on the Canadian market, have a potential for harm if taken without at least 250 ml or 8 ounces of water or other fluid. The risk includes choking and/or blockage of the throat, esophagus or intestine, according to international adverse reaction case reports. It is also important to note that these products should \"not\" be taken immediately before going to bed.\"\n\nOther adverse effects include diarrhea, belching, and bloating; in one study people taking glucomannans had higher triglyceride levels. \n\nSeveral companies have been determined by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to have, at some time, violated the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The companies include Vitacost, PediaLean, Herbal Worldwide Holdings, BioTrim, and others. The company Obesity Research Institute, the marketer of FiberThin, Zylotrim, Propolene and Lipozene, settled FTC charges that their misleading weight-loss claims violated federal laws by agreeing to pay $1.5 million in consumer redress.\n\nIn 2001, a number of jelly-type candy products containing konjac-derived glucomannan were barred from import by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to choking hazards.\n\nIt is also used as dietary supplement for farmed animals in order to help them gain more weight from food, called the feed conversion ratio. The effect of mannan oligosaccharides on animal performance was analysed in meta-analyses for poultry, pigs, and calves.\n\n"}

Initiated by John Rocca, Freeez consisted of various musicians, originally with Rocca and others such as Andy Stennett (keyboards), Peter Maas (bass guitar) and Paul Morgan or Everton McCalla (drums). They had an international hit with \"IOU\", and a UK Top 10 with \"Southern Freeez\".\n\nThe jazz funk band Freeez started in the back streets of North London in 1978. Their first single, \"Keep In Touch\" (1979) was self funded and produced by John Rocca on his Pink Rhythm Record label (later signed to Calibre/Pye), and included guitarist Jean-Paul 'Bluey' Maunick, who went on to become the initiator of the musical band Incognito. Freeez is known for its UK Top 10 song \"Southern Freeez\", from the album of the same name, also self funded and produced by John Rocca on his own Pink Rythm Records label (and later signed to Beggars Banquet) which included guest vocals by Ingrid Mansfield Allman. In the UK, the band was then contracted with the recording company Beggars Banquet Records.\n\nFreeez's last and biggest hit (a top 5 hit in many countries around the world) was the song \"IOU\", which was written and produced by Arthur Baker with lyric contributions and lead vocals by John Rocca and remixed by Jellybean Benitez and Baker. The song was also used for the 1980s breakdance movie \"Beat Street\". It scored two weeks at number one in the \"Billboard\" Dance chart, and was number 2 in the UK Singles Chart during the summer of 1983. It was followed by other releases from the album such as \"Pop Goes My Love\" / \"Scratch Goes My Dub\", which scored the U.S. top 5. During 1987 a remix of \"I.O.U.\" scored number 18 on the U.S. dance chart, plus number 23 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nFreeez reformed during 1984 without John Rocca, or any of the other original members, other than Peter Maas. With a new style and almost a new group altogether, Maas worked with Louis Smith who assumed the duties of keyboard player, co-writer and programmer with Billy Crichton as songwriter and guitarist. The new Freeez then recorded an album, \"Idle Vice\" (1985), at Studio number 2 at Abbey Road Studios in the same room where the Beatles made their recordings. \"That Beats My Patience\" was the first single from the album. Smith later became a session keyboard player and toured with the rock music band The Escape Club who had U.S. number one song \"Wild, Wild West\" and several other U.S. Top 10 successes. He also recorded as one half of Bass Kruncher with main guitarist John Holliday from The Escape Club.\n\nRocca and Stennett also recorded under other pseudonyms such Pictures and Pink Rhythm during 1985 and John Rocca went on to score two further solo number one \"Billboard\" Dance hits under his own name and the pseudonym of Midi Rain, along with several other US cult dance hits.\n\nLater in 1993–94, Maas and Paul Morgan took the Freeez format again and reformed as the Dazzling Urbanites adding Poly Koutrouzas (vocals) and Max Rutherford (guitars) to the lineup. Despite extensive preparation and rehearsals in North London (Dukes Avenue, Muswell Hill), the original success was never achieved.\n\nLate 2011 saw the first CD release of their 1980 debut album \"Southern Freeez\". The CD came as a double 'expanded' two-disc set featuring 12-inch versions, remixes and rare demos as well as newly written inlay booklet featuring notes from John Rocca and Mass. Their second album \"Gonna Get You\" has also been reissued in the same way.\n\n"}

Of German, British and eastern European descent, he is a Buddhist.\n\nIn an interview with \"Wired\", Starr admitted to feeling \"frustrated and depressed\" after \"Freaks and Geeks\" was cancelled, due to lack of offers at the age of 22. He had fired his agent and decided to quit acting altogether. He trialled for a barista job as well but didn't take it. However, a few years later he was offered \"Knocked Up\", and other offers then started to come his way.\n\nStarr was cast as Bill Haverchuck in the NBC sitcom \"Freaks and Geeks\". The series received positive reviews from critics, but it suffered from low ratings and was canceled after only one season. It gained a strong cult following. Starr then had a number of guest appearances and one-time roles on shows such as \"Ed\", \"Mysterious Ways\", \"Providence\", \"King of the Hill\", and \"Normal, Ohio\". He had a small recurring role during the third season of \"Roswell\" as the character Monk. In 2002, Starr appeared in the films \"Stealing Harvard\" and \"Cheats\".

{"id": "2175537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175537", "title": "Innes Lloyd", "text": "Innes Lloyd\n\nInnes Lloyd (24 December 1925 in Penmaenmawr, Wales – 23 August 1991) was a Welsh television producer. He had a long career in BBC drama, which included producing series such as \"Doctor Who\" and \"Talking Heads\".\n\nFollowing service in the navy, Innes Lloyd trained as an actor at the Central School of Speech and Drama. He joined the BBC in the 1950s, initially in presentation before moving into outside broadcasts. As an outside broadcast producer he covered many important sporting events such as tennis at Wimbledon, golf and motor racing. He also produced important national events such as the Royal Christmas Message and Winston Churchill's state funeral.\n\nLloyd began his drama career when he was made the producer of the science fiction series \"Doctor Who\" in 1966. He was the third producer on the programme and his duration as producer ran for two seasons between \"The Celestial Toymaker\" and \"The Enemy of the World\" (with the exception of \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", which was produced by Peter Bryant as a test piece to show that he could take over from Lloyd).\n\nDuring his tenure as producer the concept of regeneration was introduced, whereby the lead actor in the programme might be replaced. This arose following continuing health difficulties with William Hartnell as the lead actor. Lloyd and story editor Gerry Davis came up with an intriguing way of writing the Doctor out - as he was an alien being, they decided that he would have the power to change his body when it became worn out or seriously injured. Whereas John Wiles, the previous producer to Lloyd, had intended to replace Hartnell with another actor but playing the same character, Lloyd and Davis elected to change the entire personality and appearance of the Doctor. They eventually cast character actor Patrick Troughton, having previously considered another actor, Peter Jeffrey, as well as Peter Cushing, who had played Dr. Who in two Dr. Who movies. Troughton first appeared in November 1966 after the changeover from Hartnell had been seen at the end of the story \"The Tenth Planet\". \n\nLloyd's era as producer of \"Doctor Who\" became known as a monster era. It saw the introduction of recurring monsters such as the Cybermen, the Ice Warriors and the Yeti. He also terminated the purely historical stories prominent in the first three seasons of classic \"Doctor Who\".\n\nInnes Lloyd also worked on \"Thirty-Minute Theatre\", the football soap \"United!\" and \"Dead of Night\", but he is best remembered as the producer of more prestigious drama. As a BBC drama producer in the 1970s and 1980s, his chosen projects were often biographical. Collaborating with authors such as Roger Milner and Don Shaw, he brought to the screen biographies from a diverse range of, often flawed, heroes ranging from Orde Wingate and Arthur \"Bomber\" Harris, the Campbells Donald and Malcolm, through to the first Director General of the BBC John Reith. He also explored notions of Englishness in the twentieth century with productions such as \"England, Their England\" (directed by Stephen Frears), \"East of Ipswich\" (written by Michael Palin) and \"An Englishman's Castle\" (1978) starring Kenneth More; a dystopian vision of the consequence of losing the second world war. He was a frequent collaborator with Alan Bennett. That relationship started in 1972 with Bennett's poignant comedy \"A Day Out\" and continued through landmark productions such as the first series of \"Talking Heads\" until Lloyd's death in 1991. Bennett's \"An Englishman Abroad\" told the remarkable true story of the chance meeting between actress Coral Browne (playing herself) and spy Guy Burgess (Alan Bates) in Moscow in 1958, while \"A Question of Attribution\" (finished shortly before Lloyd's death) was a logical sequel, showing the radically different fate of Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures and fellow traitor Anthony Blunt. \n\nInnes was one of his two middle names as well as his mother's maiden name. Lloyd died of cancer on 23 August 1991, aged 65.\n"}

It broadcast 24 hours a day in all Continental Europe countries and 6.5 hours a day in the UK and Ireland on Sky Channel 166, in the entertainment section, adjacent to FX in the Sky EPG.\n\nThe Poker Channel was launched in the UK in March 2005 and broadcast poker programming including major tournaments such as the World Series of Poker, the World Poker Tour, instructional series, online events, documentaries, news and player profiles.\n\nThe Poker Channel was formed in 2005 by Crispin Nieboer, ex Commercial Manager at British Sky Broadcasting, who conceived the idea and pitched it originally to BSkyB (who turned it down, but ultimately launched their own dedicated poker channel in 2007). Nieboer raised the funding of £1.75m from Party Poker and two private investors and brought in James Hopkins, Sky Sports' producer of rugby and poker as a partner and shareholder. Hopkins was involved in the success of the first live poker tournament on television, The Poker Million, in 2000. The Channel recruited Chris White, ex Freemantle executive, as Commercial Director in 2006 to expand the company into European, Asian and Latin American markets.\n\nThe channel was first broadcast in the UK in March 2005 on channel number 265. Following an EPG re-structure by Sky in April 2006 the channel was moved to channel number 844 in Sky's new 'Gaming and Dating' section. The move resulted in a loss in viewing figures. In an attempt to regain viewing figures The Poker Channel rebranded itself as All in Sport in August 2006 and added some sports related programming. The rebranding resulted in a move to channel 444 in the Sports section of the Sky EPG. Due to Sky's broadcasting rules the channel was only able to broadcast poker programming for 4 to 6 hours a day.\n\nOn 31 December 2006 the channel decided to cease broadcasting as a 24-hour channel on Sky in the UK, due to Sky's EPG re-structure and limitations on poker programming broadcast hours, and started a long-term partnership with Sky Channel 166 (Info TV Ltd) to broadcast poker programming in a late evening slot, where the Poker Channel broadcast between 9.30pm and 4am. On 1 March 2007, to capitalise on the popularity of poker in Europe, The Poker Channel launched as a free-to-air channel on cable platforms in France (Free and Numericable) and Germany (Kabel BW), and in Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark on DTH satellite platform, Canal Digital.\n\nIn late 2007, The Poker Channel increased distribution in Germany (Kabel Deutschland and Unity Media) and launched with cable platforms in Belgium (BeTV and Coditel), Luxembourg (Coditel), Iceland (Skjarinn), Malta (Melita Cable) and Spain (Movistar TV). In 2008, the Channel expanded its footprint further in Finland (Welho, Maxinetti) and launched in the Netherlands, on KPN and in the digital basic package of UPC, adjacent to Eurosport in UPC's EPG, as well as in Greece (OnTelecom) and on the online TV service, Zattoo, in various European countries including Switzerland.\n\nIn 2007, the channel also extended its presence online, setting up content and marketing partnerships with online video sites including YouTube, Dailymotion, Zattoo and Blinkx.\n\nIn September 2008 The Poker Channel re-launched their web site, PokerChannelEurope.com, in partnership with online video platform Brightcove. The partnership facilitates the delivery of free advertising-supported video content on poker. The Poker Channel recruited Paul Sandells in July 2008, former UK.PokerNews.com editor, as Editor in Chief of the site.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010 the Poker Channel continued to expand its availability in Europe, including launches on all cable platforms in Portugal (Zon, Meo, Cabovisao); Neufbox (SFR) in France; Austria Telekom, Vectra and UPC in Poland, and making the channel available to all subscribers of Focussat, DigiTV and UPC Direct in Eastern Europe in Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia.\n\nIn 2010 Poker Channel partnered with media companies in Latin America to launch in Spanish language in Argentina and Mexico.\n\nOn 3 December 2012, the Poker Channel was rebranded as the Player Channel. as it increased the level of sports-betting programming on the channel including a weekly sports-betting tipping show (Best of Bets).\n\nIn October 2013, the Player Channel was acquired by leading e-sports channel Ginx TV.\n\nThe Poker Channel broadcast a range of poker related programmes acquired from around the world such as the World Series of Poker, the World Series of Poker Europe, the Aussie Millions, the Irish Open, the Grosvenor UK Poker Tour, the Great British Poker Tour, Poker Island TV, the World Series of Backgammon, the Million Dollar Cash Game, the Poker Nations Cup, the World Poker Crown, The World Heads-up Championship and the World Poker Tour.

Sonning Eye is opposite the village of Sonning, Berkshire, to which it is linked by crossing the 18th-century brick-arched Sonning Bridge combined with Sonning Backwater Bridges.\n\nSonning Eye is surrounded by the alluvial floodplain of the River Thames, much of which has been extracted for gravel, forming a number of lakes, especially upstream on this bank. In particular, a long rowing lake has been made, the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake, named after Olympic oarsmen Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Other local sports include sailing and water skiing. Berry Brook, a small tributary runs through the floodplain west and north of Sonning Eye, joining the Thames at Hallsmead Ait to the northeast.\nOn the riverside near the Sonning Backwater Bridges is the French Horn, a luxury hotel and restaurant. There is a small public car park here, a place to launch small boats, and a grass area by the river bank that is popular with fishermen.\n\nIts toponym \"\"Sonning\"\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon chieftain \"Sunna\" and \"\"Eye\"\" meaning \"island\" (cf. \"eyot\") since it is a small gravel mound surrounded by the river's flood plain. Within this low land is a true island (permanent since management of the river levels) on the Thames.\n\nUntil 1866, Sonning Eye formed part of the Oxfordshire section of Sonning civil parish.\n\nThe heart of Sonning Eye is a conservation area, including 12 architecturally Grade II listed buildings, five of which are barns that have now been converted for modern use. One house has some excellent William De Morgan tiles.\n\nThe island is roughly heart-shaped, cut through by a millrace. On the islet is \"The Mill at Sonning\", a restored 18th century watermill on a medieval site, now converted to a dinner theatre. The millrace runs through what is now the theatre bar, and powers a small turbine powering an 18.5 kW hydroelectric generator that supplies the National Grid.\n\nSet behind this on the island is \"Mill House\", a Grade II listed building owning some of the island. It was originally built in the 17th Century and once owned by the wealthy Rich family, Lords of the Manor of Sonning, hence owning its manor house towards the top of Sonning's Thames Street as well. Sir Thomas Rich founded Reading Blue Coat School just south of here in 1766 by endowing it with the income with his neighbouring farmland. In 2014, the Mill House was bought by the American film star George Clooney and his new British wife, human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, at a cost of around £10 million.\n\nThe area has been a favourite location for artists, especially views of the old, disused brick bridge and viaduct from the river bank just downstream of the island with surrounding lush flora. George Price Boyce, the Victorian watercolour painter associated with the Pre-Raphaelite art movement, visited and painted in the area.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly used on state government buildings, vehicles and other effects of the state government. It also appears on the state flag of Florida. The University of Florida was bestowed the honor of using the seal as its university seal.\n\nThe seal features a shoreline on which a Seminole woman is spreading flowers. Legend says that the woman is the historical heroine Milly Francis, but there is no documentation supporting this. Two Sabal palms (Florida's state tree) are growing. In the background a steamboat sails before a sun breaking the horizon, with rays of sunlight extending into the sky. The seal is encircled with the words \"Great Seal of the State of Florida\", and \"In God We Trust\" (the state motto).\n\nThe Florida Legislature in 1868 specified in a Joint Resolution the design of Florida's first seal. \"The Resolution specified that the seal had to be the size of an American silver dollar. It also stated that the seal should contain the sun's rays, a cocoa tree, a steamboat, and a female Indian scattering flowers. These images were to be circled by the words 'Great Seal of the State of Florida: In God We Trust.'\"\n\nSeveral changes have occurred on the seal over the years. The Indian woman no longer has a feathered headdress, which female Seminoles did not wear. \"A mountain in the background has been flattened (Florida has no mountains).

This was during a round of base closings and consolidations as the Defense Department struggled to pay the expenses of the Vietnam War within the budgetary limits set by Congress.\n\nIt is also known for the Roswell UFO incident, an event that allegedly occurred on July 4, 1947. It is alleged that a \"flying disk\" crashed during a severe thunderstorm near RIAC at Corona.\n\nThe site was used for several years to launch stratospheric balloons for Air Force projects.\n\nThe airfield also serves as a storage facility for a number of retired aircraft, including a number of Airbus A300-600R wide body jetliners formerly operated by American Airlines. A Lockheed JetStar, once owned by Elvis Presley, and sold at auction in May 2017, had spent over 30 years sitting on a tarmac at the airport.\n\nOn April 2, 2011, a new Gulfstream G650 crashed shortly after takeoff from the airport during a test flight that was being conducted by the manufacturer of this large, twin engine business jet, killing all four aboard.\n\nThe airport was used by Felix Baumgartner to launch his record-breaking freefall jump from the stratosphere on October 14, 2012.\n\nOn August 23, 2016, as part of a dramatic fleet renewal plan, American Airlines retired 20 McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft to Roswell, resulting in the most aircraft retired by a commercial airline in a single day.\n\nOn September 4, 2019, American Airlines retired its remaining McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft to Roswell.\n\nThe airport covers and has two paved runways:\n\nIn 2013 the airport had 53,030 aircraft operations, average 145 per day: 17% general aviation, 71% military, 11% air taxi and <1% airline. 34 aircraft were then based at this airport: 76% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, and 8% jet.\n\nBelow are annual total aircraft operations 2009–2013 from the FAA's Air Traffic Activity System. Average yearly increase was 5.11% over the last 5 years.\n\nRoswell's first commercial airport was near the northwest corner of the city and the first airline at Roswell was Continental Airlines, flying Denver - Colorado Springs - Pueblo - Las Vegas - Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Roswell - Hobbs - Carlsbad - El Paso. In 1944 Continental Lockheed Model 18 Lodestars flew a daily round trip Denver - Colorado Springs - Pueblo - Las Vegas, NM - Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Roswell - Hobbs - Midland/Odessa - Big Spring,TX - San Angelo - San Antonio. By 1948 Continental 21-seat Douglas DC-3s flew Denver - Colorado Springs - Pueblo - Las Vegas, NM - Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Roswell - Hobbs - Carlsbad - El Paso and Albuquerque - Roswell - Hobbs - Lubbock - Wichita Falls - Lawton, OK - Oklahoma City - Tulsa. Also in 1948, Pioneer Airlines DC-3s flew El Paso - Las Cruces - Roswell - Clovis - Amarillo. By 1951, Pioneer was no longer serving Roswell and in 1955 Pioneer was merged into Continental which allowed Continental to begin flights from Roswell to Dallas via several stops, still using DC-3s. Supplemental air service was briefly added by Bison Airlines in 1963/1964.\n\nIn 1963 Continental phased out the DC-3s and transferred all Roswell service to Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) which soon upgraded its flights with 40-seat Convair 600s. In 1968 the city closed its municipal airport and transferred airline operations to the former Walker Air Force Base. According to its April 28, 1968 schedule TTa was operating 75-seat Douglas DC-9-10 jets Albuquerque - Roswell - Abilene - Dallas - Houston which was Roswell's first jet service. In summer 1968 the routing was changed to Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Roswell - Midland/Odessa - Dallas Love Field - Houston Hobby Airport. By early 1970 this flight was originating in Los Angeles (LAX) rather than Santa Fe. TTa was renamed Texas International Airlines and continued to serve Roswell with DC-9s and Convair 600s. Passenger traffic at ROW had increased dramatically with the DC-9s and a larger terminal building opened in 1975. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in early 1976 Texas International flew DC-9s nonstop to Albuquerque, El Paso and Midland/Odessa direct to Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW), Houston (IAH), Los Angeles (LAX), Beaumont, TX and Lafayette, LA. Beside DC-9 flights from Albuquerque, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, El Paso and Midland/Odessa, this OAG lists DC-9s to Roswell direct from Baton Rouge, Corpus Christi and McAllen, TX in addition to Convair 600s to and from Albuquerque, Brownwood, TX, Carlsbad, NM, Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and Hobbs, NM. By spring 1979 Texas International only had one flight from Roswell to Albuquerque continuing to Dallas/Ft. Worth and Houston on a 100-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30. On October 1, 1979 Texas International ceased serving the airport. All service had now been transferred to commuter airlines Air Midwest, Zia Airlines, and Crown Aviation. In the 1970s Roswell also saw service by a few other commuters; Trans Central Airlines in 1970 with flights to Albuquerque, El Paso, Amarillo, and Lubbock, and by a home based airline called Roswell Airlines in 1976-78 to Albuquerque and El Paso. Permian Airways flew to Amarillo and El Paso for a short time in 1979.\n\nAir Midwest was designated as the primary replacement for TI in all of Southeastern New Mexico. Service began on March 1, 1979 with 17-seat Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners to Albuquerque, Lubbock, and later to Midland/Odessa with passengers now having to change planes and airlines to travel to hub cities such as Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW). Zia Airlines operating Handley Page Jetstreams and Crown Aviation flying Piper Navajos were competing with Air Midwest to Albuquerque, now the primary route from Roswell, offering up to thirteen roundtrip flights per day but both of these carriers shut down in 1980. Air Midwest had then become the only airline at Roswell and passenger traffic was declining. Two other small commuter airlines also served the Air Center briefly; Airways of New Mexico flew to El Paso in 1983 and 1984 then Territorial Airlines came in 1990 with flights to Santa Fe that continued to Albuquerque.\n\nIn early 1984 Mesa Airlines began serving Roswell from Albuquerque and Lubbock operating 14-seat Beechcraft 99s in competition with Air Midwest and passenger traffic nearly doubled that year. By 1985 the two carriers were operating a combined total of up to eleven roundtrip nonstop flights a day to Albuquerque.\n\nAir Midwest ended their Roswell service in early 1986 and Trans-Colorado Airlines immediately began flights to Albuquerque on Swearingen Metros. In April, 1987 Trans-Colorado became a Continental Express feeder carrier for Continental Airlines. Flights were then added to El Paso via Carlsbad re-establishing one of the routes that Continental had operated 40 years prior. At this time, Mesa added more flights to Albuquerque giving the route 20 daily departures each way. Trans-Colorado ended all service to Roswell at the end of July, 1987. In the fall of 1987, Mesa added two daily nonstop flights to DFW operated with 13-seat Beechcraft 1300 and later upgrading to 19-seat Beechcraft 1900Ds. All flights to Albuquerque were soon upgraded with Beech 1900D's as well.\n\nIn 1995 Mesa dropped their DFW flights and later that year Lone Star Airlines came to Roswell with two flights to DFW on Swearingen Metros. At one point in Nov., 1995 Lone Star operated a 32-seat Dornier 328 propjet. Mesa returned to the Roswell - DFW market in 1997 and, between Mesa and Lone Star, a total of six daily flights were operated. Lone Star later changed their name to Aspen Mountain Air but ended their Roswell service in 1998.\n\nAnother commuter, Big Sky Airlines, briefly came to the airport in 2000/2001 operating one daily roundtrip on a DFW - Hobbs - Carlsbad - Roswell - Denver route giving Roswell its first nonstop service to Denver. This carrier also used Swearingen Metros. Mesa again ended their DFW flights shortly after the events of 9/11/2001 and was only providing flights to Albuquerque.\n\nOver the next few years passenger traffic declined severely and the city pursued service with major airlines to provide nonstop regional jet flights to a major hub. American Eagle, the feeder carrier for American Airlines responded and began service on Sep. 5, 2007 with two daily flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth on 50-seat Embraer 145s. The service did so well that a third flight was added only seven months later. Mesa Airlines then ended all of their Roswell service on the last day of 2007 which left no flights to Albuquerque. At the request of Roswell city officials, American Eagle began a westbound flight to Los Angeles in August, 2009 but this flight did not become profitable and ended after one year. The carrier began another westbound flight to Phoenix in March 2016 after American Airlines completed its merger with US Airways and gained the latter carriers' hub operation at Phoenix. All flights to DFW and Phoenix were soon upgraded with 70-seat Canadair CRJ-700s.\n\nAmerican Eagle began Roswell service on September 5, 2007 operating two daily flights with 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets nonstop to Dallas/Ft. Worth as a code sharing feeder service for American Airlines. In 2008, the regional carrier occasionally operated larger 70-seat Canadair CRJ-700 regional jets on the route to DFW. In 2009 through 2010 American Eagle operated a nonstop flight to Los Angeles using a 44-seat Embraer 140 regional jet. On March 3, 2016 the carrier began nonstop service to Phoenix using a 50-seat Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet The service is subsidized by a two-year revenue guarantee with grants from the federal Small Community Air Service Development Program, the cities of Roswell, Phoenix, Artesia, Carlsbad, and Ruidoso, and Chaves and Eddy Counties. On February 16, 2017, the Phoenix flight was upgraded to a 70-seat Canadair CRJ-700 regional jet and on August 22, 2017, all three flights to DFW were upgraded to 76-seat Embraer 175 regional jets. During the fall of 2017, one DFW flight was operated by Mesa Airlines with a 79-seat Canadair CRJ-900. The aircraft used on the DFW flights now operate with 65-seat CRJ-700 regional jets operated by SkyWest Airlines as American Eagle.\n\nIn addition to the airport, RIAC is home to Millennium Transit Services, New Mexico Rehabilitation Center, a plastic manufacturer, and a candy manufacturer. Eastern New Mexico University has a campus there, and aircraft repair and refurbishing companies including AerSale have airliners stored onsite.\n\nIn 2002 a series of charter flights operated by Trans World Airlines (TWA) with Boeing 767-300 aircraft were flown into Roswell in order to transport trainees for the Federal Air Marshal service . This training was conducted at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in nearby Artesia.\n\nThe Boeing Company uses the airfield for braking performance testing of its aircraft, most recently the testing of BF Goodrich carbon brakes on the Boeing 737-900ER model. Brake testing has also been performed on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the airport.\n\nA New Mexico National Guard unit uses several buildings on the airport grounds.\n\nThe airport also serves as a bustling aircraft boneyard, with such airlines as Air Canada, American Airlines, Kenya Airways and Scoot storing their used aircraft at the location.\n\n"}

{"id": "2175569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175569", "title": "Polly Plummer", "text": "Polly Plummer\n\nPolly Plummer (1889-1949) is a major fictional character from C. S. Lewis's fantasy series \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". She appears in two of the seven books: \"The Magician's Nephew\" and \"The Last Battle\".\n\nPolly is introduced in \"The Magician's Nephew\" - which was the sixth book in the series to be published but is first in the internal chronology of Narnia.\n\nIn 1900, she is an 11-year-old girl who lives in London, England in a multi-story terrace house and is the neighbor of Digory Kirke's aunt, with whom is staying Digory and his gravely ill mother. Polly befriends Digory and one of the places they play in together, is her house's attic room, which leads into an inner-roof space which also connects to the attic rooms in \"all\" the houses in their row of terrace houses. Polly uses the attic as a hide-out where she drinks ginger beer and is gradually writing a private story which does not share with Digory.\n\nOne day whilst exploring the inner roof space in the row of terrace houses, the children accidentally enter the study of Digory's Uncle Andrew. He is an alarming person initially in his own domain but he successfully ingratiates himself with Polly and offers her a yellow ring as a gift which causes her to vanish as soon as she touches it. Uncle Andrew believes Polly has now been sent to another world and blackmails Digory into following her \nwith another ring, in order to bring her back so he can hear about what is occurring in the 'other place'. Digory is forced to comply and this results in him finding himself (with Polly) in another place. However, this is not a place as Uncle Andrew had imagined and between Digory's sharp mind and inquisitiveness and Polly's practical caution and concern for safety, they realize that if they are careful they can use this Wood between the Worlds in the same way as the inner roof space as the terrace houses; linking to all the worlds. The Wood is scattered with large pools as far as they can see and they have emerged from just one. Polly and Digory come to realize that Digory's Uncle Andrew has no inkling of this reality as he is just an ignorant dabbler in arcane arts, with only pretensions to be a magician and is also not prepared to take his own risks.\n\nAfter working this out, Polly and Digory decided to try a nearby pool and travel to the ruined city of Charn on a dead world that has a dying sun. There, against Polly's advice, Digory breaks an enchantment which releases Jadis, the future White Witch. Jadis follows the children back through the Wood to London. After returning home and being confined to her room for missing dinner and having wet shoes and stockings from jumping in puddles, Polly helps Digory return Jadis to the Wood and then attempt to return her to Charn. Instead the pool they choose takes them to the new world of Narnia, where they witness its first dawning and the creation of life by Aslan. Polly, Digory, and a cabby and his horse (who were brought along by mistake) are the only ones not alarmed by Aslan or his singing (Jadis and Uncle Andrew are both terrified); Jadis because she knows what he is and Andrew because he has no idea. After the world is created, the children and the flying talking horse Fledge (Strawberry, the Cabby's roan horse who has been transformed) fly to a walled garden in the Western Wild to retrieve a magical apple. This apple, when planted, grows into a tree that serves to protect the young land of Narnia. Aslan gave Digory an apple from the newly planted tree to heal his sick mother. Polly and Digory then return to England, where he heals his mother and buries the apple core and the rings around it.\n\nDigory later moves away to a great house that his parents inherited from a great uncle. Polly spends nearly every holiday at their house in the country, and she and Digory remain close friends all their lives.\n\nPolly's role and personality throughout the story appears to counterbalance Digory's drive, aggression and grief with her stolidity, friendship, morality and sense of care, caution and safety. Polly's role is as an emotional and moral support (and challenge) to Digory who is written as the protagonist. However, her own sense of adventure, discovery and wonder are no less than Digory's and her experience of Narnia and the spiritual enlightenment and security that their encounter with Aslan provides, give both her and Digory the basis for a very important platonic friendship throughout their lives.\n\nIn \"The Last Battle\", the final book in the series (both chronologically and in order of publication), Polly is an adult of 60. She remains in contact with the other British \"friends of Narnia\" and is present with them when the apparition of Narnia's King Tirian appears to request their help. She seems like a very cheery, friendly, and wise adult; the children refer to her as \"Aunt Polly\". She is later killed in a railway accident and is transported to Aslan's country along with the other friends of Narnia. Once she arrives in Narnia, she and Digory become young again, and they are both dressed as royalty (and referred to as \"Lady Polly\" and \"Lord Digory\").\n"}
{"id": "2175578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175578", "title": "Danny Gabbidon", "text": "Danny Gabbidon\n\nDaniel Leon Gabbidon (born 8 August 1979) is a retired Welsh professional footballer who last played for Welsh club Panteg as a defender. He has previously played for West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City (two spells), West Ham United, Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. He also played for the Wales national team.\n\nBorn in Cwmbran, Wales, Gabbidon began his career at West Bromwich Albion, joining as an apprentice in November 1996 before turning professional in July 1998. He made his Albion début in a 1–0 home defeat against Ipswich Town on 20 March 1999 and, utilised as a right-back, he went on to make 27 appearances for West Brom in all competitions. Following the appointment of Gary Megson as manager towards the end of the 1999–2000 season, Gabbidon failed to keep his place in the team. Megson switched to a 5-3-2 formation, signing Des Lyttle to fill the right-wingback position. Gabbidon joined Cardiff City on a one-month loan at the start of the 2000–01 season.\n\nGabbidon signed a permanent four-year deal with Cardiff City in September 2000, for a fee of up to £500,000 depending on appearances and future honours. His performances in the 2001–02 season helped Cardiff to the Division 2 play-offs, saw him make his senior international debut for Wales in March 2002 and win the Welsh clubman of the year award in October 2002. He signed an extension to his contract in April 2002, saying that it was the prospect of exciting times ahead that had persuaded him to do so. A back injury that had troubled him for some years, forced him off the pitch during a match against Barnsley in November 2002 and it was not until April 2003 that he returned to competitive action in a reserve game. He returned to the first-team in time to help Cardiff win promotion to Division 1 through the play-offs in May 2003. He missed several games at the beginning of the 2003–04 season with a heel injury but his assured performances at centre-half, and those of striker Robert Earnshaw, led club chairman, Sam Hammam, to insist in December 2003 that \"\"Our top young players are going nowhere\"\" in the January 2004 transfer window.\n\nGabbidon went on to earn a place in the First Division team of the year in April 2004. Despite speculation during 2004 that Gabbidon might leave Cardiff City, Gabbidon signed an extension to his contract in September 2004, tying him to the club until 2008. Cardiff were prepared to offer him \"\"...the most lucrative contract ever offered to a Cardiff player\"\", with club owner, Sam Hammam, saying, \"\"I want to make Danny Gabbidon a cornerstone of Cardiff City FC, I see him as the absolute future of this football club personified.\"\" The 2004–05 season saw Cardiff embroiled in a relegation battle in the first half of the season, something to which Gabbidon was unaccustomed. An unbeaten run in January 2005 however saw Cardiff lift themselves five points clear of the Championship relegation zone and Gabbidon named the Championship's player of the month. A financial crisis at Cardiff at the end of the season led to Gabbidon being unsure of his future at the club and he was sold to West Ham United in July 2005 to help cut the wage bill. On 4 July 2009 he played in the first ever game at the Cardiff City Stadium, an all-stars match.\n\nGabbidon moved to West Ham in July 2005, as part of a deal that also took fellow defender James Collins to Upton Park. His performances for his country during the year won him the Welsh Footballer of the Year award in October 2005. He established himself in central defence alongside Anton Ferdinand and helped West Ham to a mid-table position in the Premier League in the 2005–06 season and to the FA Cup final in May 2006, receiving a runners-up medal. After his performances in the 2005–06 season, he was voted 'Hammer of the Year' with Marlon Harewood named as runner-up. Gabbidon had been ever-present as West Ham struggled against relegation in the 2006–07 season, when he suffered a torn hamstring in November 2006, which sidelined him for a month. Groin injuries required surgery in January 2007 and again in April, ruling him out for the rest for the season. West Ham started the 2007–08 season with Anton Ferdinand and Matthew Upson in the centre of defence with Gabbidon as substitute.\n\nHe signed a two-year extension to his contract in August 2007, saying, \"\"I am disappointed not to be in the side but at least the new contracts show that the club wants both me and James [Collins] around. We will both now work hard and fight to prove we are worthy of a place in the side.\"\" Injuries meant Gabbidon played no football for West Ham from December 2007 until August 2009 when he made his return in the League Cup game against Millwall. Gabbidon is one of a number of Premier League players that use Twitter to communicate with fans. In May 2011 he was fined £6,000 by the Football Association for comments he made on Twitter in April 2011 after West Ham's 2–1 home defeat by Aston Villa. He admitted a charge of improper conduct over the tweet;-\n\"\"U know what, f*** the lot of you, u will never get another tweet from me again, you just don't get it do you. Bye bye\"\". Gabbidon was released by West Ham in June 2011.\n\nOn 24 July 2011, Gabbidon signed a one-year contract with Queens Park Rangers (QPR) after impressing on trial with the club. He made his début on 13 August 2011, scoring an own goal in the 4–0 loss to Bolton Wanderers.\nOn 17 January 2012, Gabbidon scored his first first-team goal since March 2005, a header from a corner in QPR's 1–0 FA Cup third round replay tie win against Milton Keynes Dons. It was his only goal for QPR as following the sacking of manager Neil Warnock. Gabbidon rarely played under new manager Mark Hughes and he was released at the end of the 2011–12 season.\n\nOn 18 September 2012 Gabbidon signed for Crystal Palace. He did not make his debut until 15 December 2012 coming on in the 77th minute for André Moritz in a 2–2 away draw with Birmingham City. On 20 April 2013 against Leicester City from a Stephen Dobbie free kick, Gabbidon scored his first goal for Palace and his first league goal for eight years in a match that finished in a 2–2 draw. He would only score once more for Palace, in 3–1 home win against Sunderland on 31 August 2013. In May 2014 he was released by Crystal Palace. He had played 38 games in all competitions, scoring twice.\n\nOn 1 September 2014, Gabbidon signed a one-year player/coach contract with Cardiff City. In September 2014 he was appointed as interim manager of the club following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjær. On 5 May 2015, it was announced that Gabbidon would be released at the end of his contract.\n\nIn August 2015, Gabbidon joined his hometown club, Welsh Football League Division Three side Panteg, where his brother David also played. Gabbidon acted as a player-coach at the club as well as continuing his various media commitments.\n\nGabbidon was born in Wales to a Jamaican father and a Barbadian mother. Gabbidon had made 17 appearances for the Welsh Under-21 team, when an unexpected call up for the Welsh senior squad in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus in October 2001 prevented him from making his final appearance for the under 21 side. He was an unused substitute in that match and was again called into the senior squad for a friendly game against Argentina in February 2002 but it was not until the next month that he made his debut in a 0–0 home draw against the Czech Republic on 27 March 2002. He became a regular in the team despite a back problem that caused him to miss a large part of the 2002–03 season, and was part of the squad that narrowly missed out on a place at Euro 2004, losing to Russia in the play-offs, and the squad that did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Roy Evans, the Wales assistant coach, tipped Gabbidon to be a future captain of the national side, saying, \"\"I see him as potential captain material even if it is not my decision. But he has all the qualities. You do not always have to be vocal, you need to lead by example.\"\" Gabbidon captained the side in place of the injured Ryan Giggs in 1–0 away defeat against Cyprus in November 2005 and again in place of Craig Bellamy in a 1–0 win against Bulgaria in August 2007.\n\nIn October 2010 Gabbidon announced his retirement from international football.\nHowever, on 6 January 2011, it was revealed that new Wales manager Gary Speed had asked Gabbidon to rethink his decision to retire from international football \"He is the type of player I would like to see change his mind, I have left a couple of messages for Danny and I'm sure he'll get back to me in due course\" said Speed. Wales & Celtic midfielder Joe Ledley who is also a close friend of Gabbidon, has also called for the West Ham man to return to the international fold. Ledley told his Twitter site: \"I think my best mate in football Danny Gabbidon should come out of retirement and play for Wales. We need him.\" \nHe was subsequently named in the squad to face the Republic of Ireland in February 2011.\n\nSince retiring from playing Gabbidon now works in the media providing football punditry, he primarily works with BBC Radio Wales where he co-commentates on club matches for the Welsh Football clubs. He also contributes to a weekly BBC Welsh Football podcast along with comedian Elis James and fellow Welsh International Iwan Roberts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned by the city of Carlsbad and located five nautical miles (6 mi, 9 km) southwest of its central business district. The airport is served by one commercial airline, with scheduled passenger service subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\nAs per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 2,207 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 3,417 enplanements in 2009, and 2,606 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"general aviation\" facility (the \"commercial service\" category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year).\n\nCavern City Air Terminal covers an area of 1,980 acres (801 ha) at an elevation of 3,295 feet (1,004 m) above mean sea level. It has four runways with asphalt surfaces: 3/21 is 7,854 by 150 feet (2,394 x 46 m); 14L/32R is 4,616 by 150 feet (1,407 x 46 m); 14R/32L is 5,837 by 100 feet (1,779 x 30 m); 8/26 is 5,334 by 75 feet (1,626 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending July 30, 2009, the airport had 6,862 aircraft operations, an average of 18 per day: 53% general aviation, 39% scheduled commercial, 4% air taxi, and 4% military. At that time there were 24 aircraft based at this airport: 67% single-engine, 21% multi-engine, and 12% helicopter.\n\nThe following airline offers scheduled passenger service:\nBoutique Air operates Pilatus PC-12 turboprop aircraft on all flights. The aircraft is equipped with an eight-seat executive interior. A two-person flight crew is utilized by Boutique.\n\nContinental Airlines was the first commercial air carrier to serve Carlsbad. Continental began service on May 14, 1940 with flights to El Paso and Denver, the latter included stops in Albuquerque and several other cities. Aircraft used were Lockheed Model 10 Electra's and Lockheed Lodestar's followed by the Douglas DC-3.\n\nWith the end of World War II, flights to Denver were discontinued and new flights were added going east to San Antonio and Kansas City, each making several stops. Flights to El Paso and Albuquerque remained. A small commuter carrier named Bison Airlines served the city for a couple years in the early 1960s as well. In 1963 Continental transferred its route authority for Carlsbad to Trans-Texas Airways which modified the eastbound flights to go directly to Dallas. Trans-Texas later changed their name to Texas International Airlines (TI) and replaced the DC-3s with 40-seat Convair 600 turboprop aircraft.\n\nFor a short time in the late 1970s, TI upgraded all flights with 85-seat Douglas DC-9-10 jets but reverted to the Convair 600's after about a year. In 1979 TI ended their service transferring their route authority over to commuter carriers Air Midwest and Crown Airlines. Crown operated flights to Albuquerque with Cessna 402 and Piper Navajo aircraft but went out of business in 1980.\n\nAir Midwest used 17-seat Swearingen Metroliners on flights to Albuquerque and Midland/Odessa. In 1984 Mesa Airlines began service on the same routes using Beechcraft 99 and Beechcraft 1900 airliners. Air Midwest then left the city two years later. For a very short time in the spring of 1987, Continental Express operated by Trans Colorado Airlines served the city with flights to Albuquerque and El Paso also using Metroliners. Mesa continued their service until 2007 when they, like their predecessors, grew too large and discontinued serving small cities with small aircraft. Pacific Wings, dba New Mexico Airlines, then stepped in with flights to Albuquerque, El Paso, and Midland/Odessa but used much smaller and unpressurized Cessna 208 Caravans. Flights to El Paso and Midland were later dropped and the carrier ended all service in 2015 when Boutique Air took over. Boutique began with one daily flight to Albuquerque and one to Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) using 8-seat Pilatus PC-12 aircraft. A second daily flight to Albuquerque was added in 2017.\n\nThe airport also saw service by Big Sky Airlines for a brief time in 2000/2001 which operated flights to DFW using Swearingen Metroliners.\n\nEstablished by the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 as Carlsbad Army Airfield, the facility was activated on October 12, 1942. Assigned to United States Army Air Forces West Coast Training Center (later Western Training Command) as an advanced (level 3) twin-engine training airfield. Began training flying cadets under the 940th Two-Engine Flying Training Detachment. Had a local axillary airfield for emergency and overflow landings.\n\nThe twin-engine school was replaced by Bombardier's School in mid-1942. Bombardier school lasted from 12 to 18 weeks during which a student dropped approximately 160 bombs, both in daytime and at night. Precise records were maintained of his hits and misses; the elimination rate was 12%. Upon graduation, a bombardier was transferred to an operational Second or Third Air Force training unit to join a crew being trained for overseas duty. The bombardier trainer used was the Beech AT-11 Kansan.\n\nInactivated on September 30, 1945 at the end of World War II and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers. Eventually discharged to the War Assets Administration (WAA) and became a civil airport.\n\n\n"}

Its common names are crab-of-the-woods, sulphur polypore, sulphur shelf, and chicken-of-the-woods. Its fruit bodies grow as striking golden-yellow shelf-like structures on tree trunks and branches. Old fruitbodies fade to pale beige or pale grey. The undersurface of the fruit body is made up of tubelike pores rather than gills.\n\n\"Laetiporus sulphureus\" is a saprophyte and occasionally a weak parasite, causing brown cubical rot in the heartwood of trees on which it grows. Unlike many bracket fungi, it is edible when young, although adverse reactions have been reported.\n\n\"Laetiporus sulphureus\" was first described as \"Boletus sulphureus\" by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1789. It has had many synonyms and was finally given its current name in 1920 by American mycologist William Murrill. \"Laetiporus\" means \"with bright pores\" and \"sulphureus\" means the colour of sulphur.\n\nInvestigations in North America have shown that there are several similar species within what has been considered \"L. sulphureus\", and that the true \"L. sulphureus\" may be restricted to regions east of the Rocky Mountains. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS, nuclear large subunit and mitochondrial small subunit rDNA sequences from North American collections have delineated five distinct clades within the core \"Laetiporus\" clade:\n\nThe fruiting body emerges directly from the trunk of a tree and is initially knob-shaped, but soon expands to fan-shaped shelves, typically growing in overlapping tiers. It is sulphur-yellow to bright orange in color and has a suedelike texture. Old fruitbodies fade to tan or whitish. Each shelf may be anywhere from across and up to thick. The fertile surface is sulphur-yellow with small pores or tubes and produces a white spore print. When fresh, the flesh is succulent with a strong fungal aroma and exudes a yellowish, transparent juice, but soon becomes dry and brittle.\n\n\"Laetiporus sulphureus\" is widely distributed across Europe and North America, although its range may be restricted to areas east of the Rockies. It grows on dead or mature hardwoods and has been reported from a very wide variety of host trees, such as \"Quercus\", \"Prunus\", \"Pyrus\", \"Populus\", \"Salix\", \"Robinia\", and \"Fagus\", occasionally also from conifers, from August to October or later, sometimes as early as June. In the Mediterranean region, this species is usually found on \"Ceratonia\" and \"Eucalyptus\". It can usually be found growing in clusters.\n\nThe fungus causes brown cubical rot of heartwood in the roots, tree base and stem. After infection, the wood is at first discolored yellowish to red but subsequently becomes reddish-brown and brittle. At the final stages of decay, the wood can be rubbed like powder between the fingers.\n\nA specimen weighing was found in the New Forest, Hampshire, United Kingdom, on 15 October 1990.\n\nDue to its taste, Laetiporus sulphureus has been called the \"chicken polypore\" and \"chicken-of-the-woods\" (not to be confused with \"Grifola frondosa\", the so-called \"hen-of-the-woods\").\n\nMany people think that the mushroom tastes like crab or lobster leading to the nickname \"lobster-of-the-woods\". The authors of \"Mushrooms in Color\" said that the mushroom tastes good sauteed in butter or prepared in a cream sauce served on toast or rice. It is highly regarded in Germany and North America.\n\nYoung specimens are edible if they exude large amounts of a clear to pale yellow watery liquid. The mushroom should not be eaten raw. Certain species of deer consume this type of mushroom.\n\nSome people have experienced gastrointestinal upset after eating this mushroom, and it should not be consumed raw.\n\nSevere adverse reactions can occur, including vomiting and fever, in about 10% of the population, but this is now thought to be the result of confusion with morphologically similar species such as \"Laetiporus huroniensis\", which grows on hemlock trees, and \"L. gilbertsonii\", which grows on \"Eucalyptus\".\n\nThe fungus produces the Laetiporus sulphureus lectin (LSL) which exhibits haemolytic and haemagglutination activities. Haemolytic lectins are sugar-binding proteins that lyse and agglutinate cells. These biochemical activities are promoted when bound to carbohydrates.\n\nCompared with species such as \"Agaricus bisporus\" (Swiss Brown mushroom) and the oyster mushroom, commercial cultivation of \"Laetiporus\" is non-existent except for outdoor log cultivation.\n"}

I-564 is the primary access highway to Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval base. The Interstate also links I-64 with Norfolk International Terminal via SR 406 and the Wards Corner area of Norfolk through connections with U.S. Route 460 (US 460) and SR 165.\n\nI-564 begins within the reservation of Naval Station Norfolk where Admiral Taussig Boulevard becomes a four-lane freeway; this point is also the eastern terminus of SR 337. The boulevard continues west as a four-lane divided highway to its intersection with Hampton Boulevard at naval station gates 1 and 2, where SR 337 turns south onto Hampton Boulevard toward downtown Norfolk. I-564 curves southeast through a trumpet interchange with the access road to gates 3 and 3A. The ramps to and from the interchange join the Interstate to form a six-lane freeway. I-564 descends into a tunnel to pass under the east–west runway of Chambers Field, a naval air station that has been consolidated with the larger naval base.\n\nEast of the tunnel, I-564 heads southeast parallel to a rail line between the naval air station to the north and Camp Allen, a United States Marine Corps base, to the south. The Interstate has a partial interchange with SR 406 (International Terminal Boulevard) that allows access to the highway to Norfolk International Terminal to and from the east. Within the interchange, eastbound I-564 has an exit for westbound I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway) and US 460 (Granby Street). As I-564 crosses over US 460, the eastbound freeway has a left exit to and the westbound Interstate has a left entrance from I-64's reversible HOV lanes. Eastbound I-564 has an exit for SR 165 (Little Creek Road), which leads to SR 170, before the four-lane freeway merges into I-64 in the direction of Virginia Beach.\n\nInterstate 564 replaced former SR 170, which linked Norfolk to northeastern North Carolina via North Carolina Highway 170. West of I-564, original SR 170 crossed a ferry to Hampton Roads, where it headed west along current I-64 to SR 30 northwest of Williamsburg.\n\nLong range plans may extend I-564 westward to Hampton/Newport News via a new bridge-tunnel. Traffic demands are increasing on Interstates 64 and 664. These are the only two connections between the eastern Tidewater cities with those to the northwest. The metropolitan area sees over 1.5 million people. Therefore extending I-564 would provide needed relief if the present bridges if they are not expanded from their current capacity.\n\nAll exits are unnumbered.\n\n"}

The location is between Edfu in the north towards Lower Egypt and Kom Ombo in the south towards Upper Egypt. The name \"Kheny\" (or sometimes \"Khenu\") means \"The Place of Rowing\". It was used as a major quarry site on both sides of the Nile from at least the 18th Dynasty to Greco-Roman times. Silsila is famous for its New Kingdom stelai and cenotaphs.\n\nDuring the 18th dynasty the Egyptians switched from limestone to sandstone. At this time the quarries at Gebelein were not yielding as much limestone as before. Gebel el-Silsila became a source of sandstone. The use of this stone allowed for the use of larger architraves.\n\nMany of the talatats used by Akhenaten were quarried from here, and used in buildings at Luxor and Amarna. A stela from the early part of Akhenaten's reign shows the king offering to Amun beneath the winged sun-disk. The inscription records that stone was cut for the great Benben of Harakhty in Thebes.\nAkhenaten's sculptor Bek oversaw the opening of a stone quarry here.\n\nThe site provided numerous stone quarries on both the west and east sides of the Nile. The site contains many shrines erected by officials who would have been in charge of quarrying the stone. Almost all of Ancient Egypt's great temples derived their sandstone from here, such as Karnak, Luxor, Ramesses III's Medinet Habu, Kom Ombo, and the Ramesseum.\n\nThe principal deity of Gebel el-Silsila is Sobek, the god of crocodiles and controller of the waters. Silsila is located within the Ancient Egyptian nome of Kom Ombo (or Ombos), Kom Ombo being 15 km to the south or upriver. The Roman coins of the Ombite nome exhibit the crocodile and the effigy of the crocodile-headed god Sobek.\n\nThe rock-cut temple of Horemheb is referred to as the Great Speos and may have been created in a former sandstone quarry. The temple is dedicated to seven deities, including Amun, the local god Sobek and Horemheb himself. Later rulers included further scenes and inscriptions to this structure. The scenes on the facade of the Great Speos include Ramesses III offering Maat to Amun-Re, Mut, Khonsu and Sobek in one scene and offering Maat to Anhur-Shu in another scene. Elsewhere Ramesses II is depicted in the company of his Vizier Neferronpet, while offering Maat to Ptah and Sobek. The central doorway contains a stele showing Sety II before Amun-Re, Mut and Khons.\n\nThe Great Speos also contains two chapels belonging to Viziers. On the south end of the entrance is the chapel of Panehesy, Vizier to Merenptah. Panehesy is shown adoring Merenptah. Panehesy is also depicted on a stele showing Merenptah, Queen Isetnofret, and Prince Sety-Merenptah (later Seti II). On the northern end is a similar chapel of the Vizier Paser from the reign of Ramesses II. A stele in the doorway shows Ramesses II, Queen Isetnofret and Princess-Queen Bintanath. The king is offering Maat to Ptah and Nefertem.\n\nSouth of Horemheb's Great Speos are a collection of erected royal stelae. The stelae date to a variety of reigns. They include a rock stela depicting Ramesses V before Amun-Re, Mut, Khons and Sobek. Ramesses III is shown offering Maat to Amun-Re, Mut and Khons.\nFrom a much later time is the stele of Shoshenq I. The scene shows Shoshenq accompanied by his son Iuput. The text is dated to year 21 of his reign. The goddess Mut leads the king and his son before Amun-Re, Re-Harakhti and Ptah.\n\nSouth of the royal stelae several cut shrines are found. These include shrines for the Scribe of the Treasury of Thutmose, the Overseer of the Seal of Min (from the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III), an official named Maa, and the Scribe of the Nome Ahmose (from the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III).\n\nNorth of the royal stelae more shrines can be found. One shrine belonged to an official dated to the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III: User, vizier. A shrine at this site records User's family, including his father Amethu called Ahmose.\n\nFurther shrines were constructed near the river. Most of these date to the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III. Included are the shrines of some high-ranking officials such as the Overseer of the Granaries Minnakht, the Overseer of the Seal and Royal Herald Sennufer, the Overseer of the Seal Nehesy, the Overseer of the Prophets of Upper and Lower Egypt Hapuseneb, and the Great Steward of the Queen Senenmut. Senenmut's is noteworthy because the inscriptions show a change in the status of Hatshepsut. She is said to be the \"King's First-born Daughter\" and she is depicted as a pharaoh in a striding fashion.\n\nAdditionally, three rock-cut shrines were constructed and the site also shows some royal stelae. The shrines belong to Seti I, Ramesses II and Merenptah. One of the stele depicts Ramesses III offering wine to Amun-Re, Re-Harakhty and Hapi. The stele mentions year 6 of the reign of Ramesses III. Adjoining this is another stele, this one depicting Horemheb adoring Sety I.\n\nBetween the shrines of Merenptah and Ramesses II a stele was erected depicting Merenptah and a son (likely Sety-Merenptah, but the name has been destroyed) offering Maat to Amun-Re. The royals are accompanied by the Vizier Panehesy.\n\nSurvey work of the east bank has revealed 49 quarries, the largest being Quarry 34 (Q34) (reviewed in 7 partitions due to its immensity) containing 54 stone huts.\n\nThe East bank holds several stele from the time of Amenhotep III. The stele and their texts are described in Karl Richard Lepsius' \"Denkmahler\". The stelae are damaged, but one of them was inscribed in year 35. Amenhotep is shown adoring Amun-Re and is called \"beloved of Sobek\" in the inscriptions. The stela have been studied and described by Georges Legrain.\n\nA shrine with stele on three sides depicting Amenhotep III is located at Gebel el-Silisila East. In the scenes Amenhotep III is accompanied by an official named Amenhotep, who held the title \"Eyes of the King in the whole land\".\n\nA stela was discovered showing Akhenaten - named Amenhotep IV - before Amun-Re.\n\nFurther finds date to the time of Sety I. An inscription from year 6 shows Sety I before Amun-Re, Ptah and a goddess. Another stele shows the Commander of troops of the fortress of the Lord of the Two Lands, named Hapi adoring the cartouche of Sety I.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Temple of Kheny is a significant find for the east bank. The other item of significance is the collection of over 5,000 epigraphic symbols and hieroglyphs collected from this site and all over Egypt. There appears to be an image depicting the actual transport of the sandstone blocks to temple sites.\n\nThe east bank also has two unfinished ram-headed sphinxes or criosphinxes.\n\nIndications have been noted of possible stables providing horses to the Roman Caesars.\n\nThis is a list of notable monuments for Gebel el-Silsila.\n\nRemains of the Temple of Kheny have been rediscovered as surface remnants at Gebel el Silsila, showing the temple foundations and blockwork. The ruins are one of the few remnants of the settlement of Kheny or Khenu, the ancient Egyptian name, meaning “Rowing Place”, for Gebel el-Silsila. The finding confirms that Gebel el Silsila is a sacred site in addition to its quarry function. It is unknown at this time to whom the temple is dedicated, but there are indications that it may be to Sobek. Further, the site seems to lean towards solar worship.\n\nThe worship center was described as a destroyed Ramesside temple on a 1934 published rudimentary map by Egyptologist Ludwig Borchardt after being recorded between 1906 and 1925. The temple was then forgotten and lost.\n\nThe temple appears to have four \"dressed floor levels\". Two painted sandstone fragments indicate that the temple's ceiling had an astronomical motif with stars and sky representing the celestial heavens.\n\nThe rediscovery and on-site work have been conducted since 2012 by teams led by archeologists Maria Nilsson and John Ward as part of the Gebel el Silsila Survey Project.\n\nThe changeover of constructing temples in Ancient Egypt from limestone to sandstone may have started with the Temple of Kheny. It appears that the Temple of Kheny may be the \"mother temple\" to all future temples built with sandstone.\n\nAccording to Nilsson:\n\nThe entire site of Gebel el Silsila covering about 20 square kilometers is in a multi-year epigraphic survey project directed by archaeologist Maria Nilsson under the auspices of Lund University, and assistant-director John Ward. As of 2015, the team had 13 members, 2 SCA inspectors, and assistants. Various teams organized by them have been working on-site since 2012. Emphasis has been placed on the east bank due to insufficient recording in the past and deteriorating conditions in the present epigraphically. Its major finding is the Temple of Kheny. The project is also noted for its use of digital archaeology.\n\nThe survey project has also found a blue scarab, an amulet depiction of a dung beetle.\n\nThe present-day climate of Gebel el-Silsila (Khenu) is extremely clear, dry, bright, and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with low seasonal variation, and with about 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Silsila is located in one of the sunniest regions on Earth.\n\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies the weather of Gebel el-Silsila as a hot desert climate (BWh), like the rest of Egypt.\n\nWinters are short, brief, and extremely warm. Wintertime is very pleasant and enjoyable while summertime is unbearably hot with blazing sunshine, made only more bearable because the desert air is dry.\n\nThe climate of Khenu is extremely dry year-round, with less than 1 mm of average annual precipitation. The desert locale is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air is mainly dry here and becomes drier southward and upriver towards Aswan. The air becomes more humid northward and downriver towards Luxor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Wiles was credited as producer on four serials between 1965 and 1966, namely \"The Myth Makers\", \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" (which lasted for twelve episodes), \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\", and \"The Ark\".\n\nAlthough he had a good working relationship with story editor Donald Tosh, Wiles found that he was unable to make many changes to the format of the programme. Attempts to make the series darker led to clashes with actor William Hartnell, who as the sole remaining member of the original team saw himself as the guardian of the series' original values. An attempt to give new companion Dodo Chaplet a cockney accent was vetoed by Wiles' superiors, who ordered that the regulars must speak \"BBC English\". With Hartnell increasingly in poor health and hostile to Wiles, the latter sought a way to replace the actor. However, this was again opposed by Wiles' superiors. Wiles also disliked the lengthy \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" story which had been commissioned by the previous production team and which proved difficult to realise. One of his few changes that lasted even a short time was to limit nearly all stories to just four episodes.\n\nIn early 1966, Wiles resigned in frustration over an inability to steer the show in the direction he wished. Tosh resigned in sympathy. Of the episodes from his tenure, only the four episode serial \"The Ark\", and three episodes from \"The Daleks' Master Plan\", still survive in the BBC's archives.

He was a presenter of \"Blue Peter\" from 1978 to 1986.\n\nGroom was born in Chesterfield in Derbyshire, and was brought up on a farm in Dethick, which he often visited for \"Blue Peter\" reports. He was educated at Herbert Strutt Grammar School in Belper in Derbyshire, followed by the University of Birmingham.\n\nGroom worked briefly as an English teacher before becoming a disc jockey and joining \"Blue Peter\" in 1978. Groom's co-presenters on \"Blue Peter\" until leaving in 1986 were Lesley Judd, John Noakes, Christopher Wenner, Tina Heath, Peter Duncan, Sarah Greene, Janet Ellis and Michael Sundin.\n\nGroom became known among the programme's production team for his dry humour and ability to ad lib innuendo in his broadcasting (which would pass over the heads of the programme's main audience of children). One such statement was at the end of a piece on a replacement door knocker at Durham Cathedral, declaring \"what a beautiful pair of knockers\". Another remark followed a piece about hedge maintenance where he closed with the remark, \"As long as you have a decent length to start with, well then you can manage a good lay\" much to the irritation of producer Biddy Baxter. Indeed, Groom and Baxter disagreed on a great many aspects of the show. Groom had confidently put forward an idea for a section of the show called 'Grooming Flantastic' which involved fans of the show coming into the studio and throwing flans at the guests and presenters whilst wearing butterscotch waistcoats and trousers. Baxter objected and told Groom that it was an unoriginal ripoff of another TV show starring Chris Tarrant, but with butterscotch attire.

He is currently a free agent.\n\nHe started his career with Cardiff City, progressing through the club's youth system before making his senior debut in 2000.\n\nHe also played for two periods with West Ham. Collins as well as for the Wales national football team, making his debut in 2004. He went on to win 51 caps before announcing his international retirement in 2017.\n\nCollins was born in Newport and attended St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School as a teenager. He was a schoolmate of Newport County player and manager Michael Flynn, who is two years older than Collins.\n\nAs a youngster, Collins played in the youth teams of local sides Shaftesbury and Pill before joining Cardiff City at the age of 15. He signed as a trainee in August 2000, after playing local football in his native city of Newport. He was one of two first-year apprentices offered a professional contract for the 2000–01 season along with Martyn Giles. He made his debut for Cardiff at the age of 17 in an FA Cup match against Bristol Rovers on 19 November 2000, which Cardiff won 5–1, as a substitute in place of Robert Earnshaw. However, a broken toe suffered soon after limited his appearances during his debut season.\n\nIn his early years with the club, Collins played as both a defender and a striker with manager Lennie Lawrence stating that \"it wasn't clear whether James was a centre-half or a centre-forward\" when he was appointed manager. Collins' broke into the first-team playing as a forward, scoring in his first start for the club during a 1–1 draw with Colchester United in November 2001. Lawrence and his coaching staff would settle on playing Collins as a defender and he went on to make 86 appearances in all competitions for Cardiff, scoring six goals. He won the Welsh Young Player of the Year award in 2005.\n\nCollins joined West Ham United in July 2005, along with his centre-back partner at Cardiff, Danny Gabbidon, in a £3.5 million deal for the pair as Cardiff attempted cut their wage bill and raise money. West Ham had previously seen a £350,000 bid for Collins rejected. Cardiff chairman Sam Hammam later stated that club could have received a better price for Collins from other clubs but West Ham were the only team to place a bid for Gabbidon and would only complete the transfer if it included both players.\n\nDue to fitness problems as well as competition from more experienced players, Collins did not make his West Ham debut until the League Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday on 20 September 2005, which West Ham won 4–2. He made his Premiership debut on 29 October 2005 in a 2–0 away defeat by Liverpool. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 1–1 draw with Portsmouth on Boxing Day 2005. Collins ended his first Hammers season with two league goals, after scoring again in a 4–1 defeat against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in April 2006.\n\nDue to injuries to new signing Matthew Upson and 2005–06 Hammer of the Year Danny Gabbidon, Collins was given the chance to form a centre-back partnership with Anton Ferdinand towards the end of the 2006–07 season.\n\nOn 28 January 2008, it was announced that Collins would be out for a year after suffering severe ligament damage in a West Ham reserve game against Portsmouth. His injury kept him out for nine months and on 26 October 2008, Collins returned to first team action, starting in West Ham's 2–0 loss to Arsenal at Upton Park.\n\nCollins signed a four-year contract with Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee on 1 September 2009, the last day of the transfer window. On his league debut for Villa, on 13 September, he helped them keep a clean sheet in the Second City Derby against Birmingham City. His first goal for the club was the winner against Chelsea in a 2–1 victory, in which he was named Man of the Match. Collins played the full ninety minutes of the League Cup Final at Wembley on 28 February 2010, which saw Aston Villa beaten 1–2 by Manchester United. Collins also played the full game when Villa returned to Wembley on 10 April 2010, in a 0–3 defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final. In March 2011, manager Gérard Houllier fined Collins and fellow centre-back Richard Dunne two weeks' wages after what was reported as \"a boozy row with club staff during a team-bonding exercise\".\n\nOn 1 August 2012, Collins signed for West Ham United for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract. He was allocated the number 19 shirt, which he wore in his first spell with the club. On 18 August 2012, Collins started alongside Winston Reid in a 1–0 home win against his former club, Aston Villa on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League season. He was also awarded 'Man of the Match' for his performance on his second 'debut'. Collins first goals in his second spell with West Ham came on 5 January in an FA Cup 3rd round tie against Manchester United. The game finished 2–2 with Collins scoring two headed goals from crosses by Joe Cole. Collins signed a two-year extension to his contract on 24 December 2015, which could keep him at the club until 2018. On 15 August 2016, Collins scored West Ham's first Premier League goal of the season, in a 2–1 defeat against London rivals, Chelsea.\n\nFollowing the end of the 2017–18 season, it was announced that Collins' contract would not be renewed and that he would leave the club on 30 June. Collins posted an Instagram message in which he said he was \"heartbroken\" by the situation.\n\nCollins had been training at Aston Villa following his release from West Ham United and impressed manager Dean Smith, being offered a five-week contract in December. However, he injured his calf in his first training session after signing the short-term deal, potentially ruling him out for its duration, leading Collins to cancel the contract.\n\nOn 11 January 2019, Collins joined Ipswich Town, signing a contract until the end of the season. He made his debut in a 1-0 home win against Rotherham United on 12 January. He was released at the end of the 2018–19 season after making just 6 appearances for the club.\n\nCollins played for the Wales under-21 team on several occasions and captained them in a match against Germany U21s.\n\nCollins made his debut for the senior Wales side against Norway in 2004, becoming the first player in Wales' history to have played at every age level from schoolboy to the senior team. He scored his first goal for Wales in a 3–1 defeat to Cyprus on 13 October 2007. Ever present during 2010 World Cup qualifying, he captained Wales in the last qualifier against Liechtenstein and helped keep a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. Collins was given the captain's armband for the senior squad for the first time for a friendly against Sweden on 3 March 2010. Collins scored his first international goal in the 21st minute of a Euro 2008 qualifying match against Cyprus in October 2007. On 7 September 2012 in a 2014 World Cup qualifying against Belgium game he was given a straight red card for a two-footed lunge on Guillaume Gillet, Wales went on to lose the match 2–0. Having made 51 appearances for Wales, Collins announced his international retirement in November 2017.\n\nCollins is a redhead and is nicknamed \"Ginge\" and \"Ginger Pelé\".\n\nCardiff City\n\nWest Ham United\n\nAston Villa\n\n"}
{"id": "2175625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175625", "title": "Santa Fe Regional Airport", "text": "Santa Fe Regional Airport\n\nSanta Fe Regional Airport is ten miles southwest of Santa Fe, in Santa Fe County, New Mexico.\n\nThe Santa Fe Regional Airport opened in 1941. The airport had seen an increase in airline flights, with 43,329 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2011 and 115,000 in 2018. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a \"general aviation\" airport based on enplanements in 2008, when Santa Fe had no airline service while airport officials awaited federal approval of an environmental impact assessment (the \"commercial service\" category requires at least 2,500 per year). However, as of the 2019-2023 NPIAS, it is listed as a \"commercial service - primary nonhub\" airport. As of December 15, 2016, Santa Fe is now served by American Eagle with regional jet flights to Dallas/Fort worth and Phoenix and by United Express with regional jets to Denver.\n\nSanta Fe was first served through Boyd Field, an airport that was on the west side of Cerrillos Road between Rodeo Road and Jaguar Drive. The current airport, several miles to the southwest, opened in 1941.\n\nSanta Fe's first commercial airline service was by Mid Continent Air Express beginning in 1929 operating on a route from El Paso to Denver with stops at Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, NM, Pueblo, and Colorado Springs, CO. The route was replaced with Western Air Express in 1931 and again by Varney Speed Lines, the predecessor of Continental Airlines in 1934. The southwest division of Varney was operating daily round trip air service flown with a single engine Lockheed Vega aircraft on a routing of El Paso - Albuquerque - Santa Fe - Las Vegas, NM - Pueblo, CO with continuing service operated by another airline, Wyoming Air Service, on to Colorado Springs and Denver. In 1936, the southwest operating division of Varney was acquired by Robert F. Six who in 1937 renamed the air carrier Continental Air Lines which then began operating Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior twin prop aircraft on a daily round trip routing of El Paso - Albuquerque - Santa Fe - Pueblo, CO - Colorado Springs - Denver. Mr. Six would serve as CEO of the airline until 1981. Thus, Santa Fe was one of the very first destinations served by Continental which would become a major domestic and international airline. In 1940 Continental began operating Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar twin prop aircraft on a daily round trip routing of Denver - Colorado Springs - Pueblo, CO - Las Vegas, NM - Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Roswell, NM - Hobbs, NM - Midland/Odessa - Big Spring, TX - San Angelo - San Antonio. Continental then introduced Douglas DC-3 service and in 1948 was flying from Santa Fe to Albuquerque, El Paso, Colorado Springs and other smaller cities in Colorado and New Mexico. In 1951 Continental expanded its service and was operating the DC-3 on a route between El Paso and Denver that included Las Cruces, Truth or Consequences, Socorro and Raton in New Mexico and Trinidad in Colorado in addition to Santa Fe and the other aforementioned destinations on the El Paso-Denver route and was also providing direct, no change of plane DC-3 flights between the airport and San Antonio. In 1955 Continental merged with Pioneer Airlines and took over that carrier's service on the Albuquerque - Santa Fe - Clovis - Lubbock - Abilene - Ft. Worth - Dallas route. By 1959, the airline had introduced its first turbine powered airliner service into Santa Fe with the four engine, British-manufactured Vickers Viscount turboprop operating on four of its six daily flights. By 1963 Continental Airlines was growing rapidly with large jets and began transferring its route authority for its smaller cities to other carriers. The El Paso - Denver route with all the intermediate stops between the two cities was transferred to Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) and the Albuquerque - Dallas route with all the intermediate stops en route went to Trans-Texas Airways which resulted in Continental no longer serving the Santa Fe airport.\n\nTrans World Airlines, (TWA), began Santa Fe service in 1949 by adding the city as a stop on its transcontinental mainline route using Douglas DC-3 aircraft. Initially the daily routing was New York LaGuardia Airport - Pittsburgh - Columbus, OH - Dayton - Chicago Midway Airport - Kansas City - Topeka, KS - Wichita - Amarillo - Santa Fe - Winslow, AZ - Phoenix - Los Angeles. Albuquerque was later added as stop on the way to Winslow and the Martin 4-0-4 aircraft replaced the DC-3s. By 1959, TWA was operating four engine Lockheed Constellation propliner service into Santa Fe with a daily routing of Chicago Midway Airport - Kansas City - Wichita - Amarillo - Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Los Angeles but only in the westbound direction. TWA's service to Santa Fe ended by late 1960.\n\nPioneer Airlines began serving Santa Fe in 1948 with two daily round trip flights operated with Douglas DC-3s on a routing of Albuquerque - Santa Fe - Las Vegas, NM - Tucumcari, NM - Clovis, NM - Lubbock, TX - Abilene, TX - Mineral Wells, TX - Fort Worth, TX - Dallas and by 1953 was operating Martin 2-0-2 aircraft with direct, no change of plane flights to Houston Hobby Airport making eight stops en route (the stops at Las Vegas, NM and Tucumcari, NM had been dropped). Pioneer was then acquired by and merged into Continental Airlines in 1955.\n\nFrontier Airlines (1950-1986) began flights to Santa Fe in 1963 replacing Continental Airlines at four stops made on the El Paso - Denver route. Frontier initially operated Douglas DC-3, Convair 340, and Convair 440 prop aircraft. By the late 1960s Frontier was operating Convair 580 turboprops from the airport nonstop to Denver and Albuquerque, with direct service to Phoenix, Tucson and El Paso. In June 1972 Frontier (as well as Texas International Airlines) both ceased operating at Santa Fe citing unsafe runway conditions.\n\nTrans-Texas Airways (TTa) began their Santa Fe service later in 1963 replacing Continental Airlines at all the stops made on the Albuquerque - Dallas route that Continental acquired from Pioneer Air Lines eight years prior. Initially the carrier used Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft and later upgraded to Convair 600 turboprops. In 1967, TTa had introduced the first jet service into Santa Fe with the Douglas DC-9-10 on nonstop flights to Dallas Love Field with continuing direct service to Houston Hobby Airport. DC-9s were also flown to Albuquerque, Roswell and Midland/Odessa on a flight routing to Dallas and Houston from Santa Fe. Trans-Texas Airways changed its name to Texas International (TI) and discontinued DC-9 jet service into Santa Fe by early 1970 but continued to serve the airport with the Convair 600's until June 1972 when both Texas International and Frontier were forced to suspend all flights citing unsafe runway conditions. Neither carrier ever returned.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s decades, several small commuter airlines served Santa Fe including Bison, Trans Central, The Santa Fe Airline Company, Mountain Air, Trans American Airways, Trans Western Airlines, Zia Airlines and Stahmann Farms. These carriers used a variety of commuter aircraft including Cessna 402's and Piper Navajo's on flights to Albuquerque and Denver. Zia had served Santa Fe from 1974 through 1980, also operating flights to Farmington, New Mexico for a short time and had upgraded to Handley Page Jetstream propjet aircraft in 1979.\n\nLarger commuter and regional carriers served Santa Fe from the 1980s through the mid 2000s. A second Pioneer Airlines began flights to Denver in 1981 flying Beechcraft 99 and Swearingen Metro aircraft. This Pioneer Airlines went on to becoming a Continental Commuter feeder carrier on behalf of Continental Airlines in 1983 before ending service in 1985. This was the first major airline code-share service recorded in New Mexico.\n\nMesa Airlines began service in 1985 operating Cessna 208 Caravan, Beechcraft 99, Beechcraft 1300, and Beechcraft 1900 turboprops. Mesa first operated shuttle service between Santa Fe and Albuquerque then later began service to Denver. In 1995 Mesa's flights to Denver were upgraded to operate on behalf of United Airlines as United Express but all service ended in 1998 and was replaced by Great Lakes Aviation.\n\nMountain Air Express, a feeder carrier for Western Pacific Airlines, flew Dornier 328 propjets nonstop to Colorado Springs in the spring of 1997.\n\nAspen Mountain Air served Santa Fe from 1997 through 1998 with Dornier 328's on behalf of American Airlines by reinstating nonstop flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth. Although Aspen Mountain Air operated under a code-share agreement with American, they were not considered as American Eagle.\n\nGreat Lakes Aviation came to Santa Fe in 1998 by resuming the United Express flights to Denver after the Mesa Airlines contract expired. Great Lakes also used Beechcraft 1900D aircraft and had increased their Denver service to as many as twelve flights per day but then lost their United Express designation in early 2002. They continued to serve Santa Fe independently via their own identity until 2007 as no other United Express carriers had implemented service. Great Lakes returned to Santa Fe with flights to Denver, Phoenix, and Clovis for a short period in 2013 until ExpressJet operating Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets initiated service to Denver as United Express.\n\nAmerica West Express operated by Mesa Air/Air Midwest also briefly served Santa Fe in 2000 and 2001 with Beechcraft 1900s nonstop to Phoenix via a code sharing feeder service for America West Airlines.\n\nFrom December 11, 2007 until June 11, 2009, Santa Fe had no scheduled passenger airline service. In June 2007, the airport was upgraded to Class 1 status to allow regional jet flights. The city's government and interested airlines entered negotiations to split the cost of upgrades. In July 2007 Delta Air Lines announced new regional jet flights would commence in December, 2007 between Santa Fe and LAX and Salt Lake City International Airport which would have marked the advent of the first regional jet service into Santa Fe. However, all scheduled services, including planned American Eagle flights to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and LAX which were announced shortly after Delta made its plans known, were suspended indefinitely pending federal approval of an environmental assessment. Delta and American then removed flights to Santa Fe from their schedules and it was unknown at that time if and when flights would begin.\n\nThe completion of the environmental impact statement was announced on February 26, 2009, but neither Delta or American Airlines immediately announced any resumption of their intentions to serve the facility, citing changed economic conditions. On March 12, 2009 the City of Santa Fe announced that American Eagle, the regional affiliate of American Airlines, would begin one daily flight to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) on June 11, 2009. On the same day service began, American Eagle also announced additional service to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) beginning November 19, 2009. These American Eagle flights to DFW and LAX were operated with Embraer ERJ-140 and ERJ-145 regional jet aircraft.\n\nOn July 27, 2009 American Eagle announced a second daily flight to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Service began on November 19, 2009. On December 14, 2009, a third daily flight to Dallas-Fort Worth was announced. Service began on February 11, 2010. However, on June 18, 2010, it was announced that service would temporarily revert to two daily flights to Dallas-Fort Worth in August 2010, with the third flight expected to return in April 2011.\n\nOn February 28, 2011, it was announced that the third daily flight to Dallas-Fort Worth would return in April as planned, and that a fourth daily flight would begin in July 2011. The third daily flight operated until November 16, 2011, and the fourth daily flight operated from July 2, 2011 to August 22, 2011. The third daily flight again made a return in April 2012, and the fourth daily flight returned on June 14, 2012.\n\nEnvoy Air (formerly American Eagle Airlines and currently operating under the American Eagle brand) then operated Embraer ERJ-140 and ERJ-145 regional jets on all its nonstop flights between Santa Fe and Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW); This service was supplemented with ExpressJet Airlines operating as American Eagle with 50-seat Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets. SkyWest Airlines, operating as American Eagle, replaced American Eagle Airlines service to Los Angeles on November 15, 2012 with Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets. All service to Los Angeles ended on September 8, 2015 at which time all American Eagle service to DFW began operating by ExpressJet. On December 15, 2016 American Eagle operated by SkyWest Airlines began service from Santa Fe to Phoenix using a larger, 70-seat, Canadair CRJ-700 regional jet and on February 16, 2017, American Eagle operated by ExpressJet upgraded its three daily flights to DFW to CRJ-700 regional jets as well. All flights to DFW were changed to SkyWest as the operating carrier effective December 26, 2018. A fourth daily flight to DFW began on April 2, 2019, all utilizing CRJ-700 regional jets. A second daily flight to Phoenix was added in May, 2019 utilizing a Canadair CRJ-900 regional jet operated by Mesa Airlines. This aircraft, seating up to 79 passengers, is the largest to serve Santa Fe. In March, 2020, two of the DFW flights were upgraded to CRJ-900's and by summer of 2020, plans call for five daily flights to DFW, three of which will utilize the CRJ-900 and two on the 76-seat Embraer 175. Saturday only service to Los Angeles will be added on April 11, 2020 using a CRJ-700 operated by SkyWest.\n\nAs of August 2011, the city of Santa Fe was in discussions with Great Lakes Airlines concerning the possible resumption of turboprop passenger service to Denver. Great Lakes then resumed scheduled flights into Santa Fe. On December 1, 2012, Great Lakes initiated nonstop flights to Denver and Clovis, NM with Beechcraft 1900D turboprop aircraft configured with 19 passenger seats. On March 15, 2013, Great Lakes announced it would replace the Clovis flights with service to the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) starting May 1. However, Great Lakes subsequently cancelled all flights once again from the airport and no longer serves Santa Fe.\n\nOn December 19, 2012, it was announced that ExpressJet Airlines, operating as United Express on behalf of United Airlines, would initiate twice daily regional jet service to Denver International Airport (DEN) beginning May 1, 2013. These flights are currently being operated with 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145 regional jet aircraft and comprise the first ever nonstop jet service between Santa Fe and Denver. This service was replaced by Trans States Airlines as United Express on July 2, 2015 which also operates Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets. A third daily flight to Denver operated from September 24 through October 23, 2015. During the month of October, 2016, 2017, and 2018, four daily flights to Denver were operated. During October 2018, two of the four Denver flights on Saturdays were operated with the larger CRJ-700 regional jets operated by SkyWest Airlines. During October, 2019, five daily flights to Denver were operated. Service was then cut back to three flights however a fourth flight is scheduled to return for the summer of 2020, all still on the 50-seat Embraer-145.\nOn September 27, 2017, the Santa Fe City Council approved an expansion plan for the airport to better accommodate future airline service. Coinciding with the approval of this expansion plan is a renaming of the airport from Santa Fe Municipal Airport to Santa Fe Regional Airport.\n\nThe airport is home to an Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) for Company C, 1st General Support Aviation Battalion, 171st Aviation Regiment (C/1-171 AVN) of the New Mexico Army National Guard, flying the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.\n\nSanta Fe Regional Airport covers 2,128 acres (861 ha) at an elevation of 6,348 feet (1,935 m). It has three asphalt runways: 2/20 is 8,366 by 150 feet (2,550 x 46 m); 15/33 is 6,316 by 100 feet (1,925 x 30 m); 10/28 is 6,301 by 75 feet (1,921 x 23 m).\n\nIn 2013 the airport had 72,031 aircraft operations, average 197 per day: 71% general aviation, 12% air taxi, and 8% military. 207 aircraft were then based at this airport: 71% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, 10% jet, 2% helicopter, 1% glider, 0% ultralight, and 5% military.\n\nThe data below lists annual total aircraft operations from 2003–2013 from the FAA's Air Traffic Activity System. Average annual increase in aircraft operations was 0.88% over the last 10 years.\n\n"}

Based on Louisa May Alcott's 1868–69 two-volume novel of the same name, it was filmed in Technicolor and directed by Mervyn LeRoy. The screenplay was written by Sally Benson, Victor Heerman, Sarah Y. Mason, and Andrew Solt. The original music score was composed by Adolph Deutsch and Max Steiner. The film also marked the American film debut of Italian actor Rossano Brazzi. Sir C. Aubrey Smith, whose acting career had spanned four decades, died in 1948; \"Little Women\" was his final film.\n\nIn the small town of Concord, Massachusetts, during the Civil War, the March sisters—Meg (Janet Leigh), Jo (June Allyson), Amy (Elizabeth Taylor), and Beth (Margaret O'Brien)—live with their mother in a state of genteel poverty, their father having lost the family's fortune to an unscrupulous businessman several years earlier. While Mr. March (Leon Ames) serves in the Union Army, Mrs. March (Mary Astor), affectionately referred to as \"Marmee\" by her daughters, holds the family together and teaches the girls the importance of giving to those less fortunate than themselves, especially during the upcoming Christmas season. Although the spoiled and vain Amy often bemoans the family's lack of material wealth and social status, Jo, an aspiring writer, keeps everyone entertained with her stories and plays, while the youngest March daughter, the shy and sensitive Beth, accompanies Jo's productions on an out-of-tune piano.\n\nThe spirited Jo, a tomboy in search of male companionship, strikes up a friendship with Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence (Peter Lawford), the grandson of the March's wealthy, but cantankerous neighbor, James Laurence (C. Aubrey Smith). Later that winter, Jo so impresses Mr. Laurence with her forthrightness and her beneficial effect on the brooding Laurie, that he invites the March sisters to a fancy dress ball at his sumptuous home. At the ball, Meg is courted by John Brooke (Richard Stapley), Laurie's tutor, and Jo consents to dance with Laurie while Amy and Beth breathlessly view the scene from their perch atop the staircase. Mr. Laurence's gruff demeanor is softened upon meeting Beth, who reminds him of the beloved granddaughter he lost, and when he learns of her musical talent, he offers her the use of his grand piano. The beautiful evening ends on a sour note, however, when Amy and Beth overhear the snobbish Mrs. Gardiner (Isabel Randolph) and her daughter gossiping about Marmee.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Laurie's affection for Jo grows, but Jo rebuffs him as a suitor, claiming that although she loves him as a friend, she will never marry. Meanwhile, Jo attempts to discourage Meg's deepening feelings for Mr. Brooke, fearing that a marriage will break the bond between the sisters. Spring arrives, and Marmee receives word that Mr. March has been wounded and sent to an Army hospital in Washington, D.C. Jo asks her wealthy Aunt March (Lucile Watson) for Marmee's train fare, but the two have a heated argument when the impatient Jo refuses to address Aunt March with the decorum the proud woman demands. As usual, Aunt March comes through for the family, but not before Jo has had her beautiful chestnut locks cut off and sold in order to pay for Marmee's trip. While carrying out Marmee's work for the poor in her absence, Beth contracts scarlet fever, and the distressed and frightened sisters realize how much they depend upon Marmee. Just as Marmee returns, however, Beth's fever breaks, and the entire family is reunited when Laurie arranges for the surprise return of Mr. March.\n\nA few months later, Meg marries Mr. Brooke and Laurie asks Jo to marry him, but she turns him down, explaining that she is uncomfortable in high society and wishes to devote her life to writing. Greatly disappointed, Laurie leaves for Europe, and Jo, saddened by the seeming loss of both Meg and Laurie, who she considers to be her best friend, moves to New York to pursue her career. While boarding at the home of the Kirke family, Jo meets Professor Bhaer (Rossano Brazzi), the Kirke children's German tutor, who introduces her to art museums and the opera. Bhaer later agrees to read Jo's stories, but she is devastated when he later criticizes her work, dismissing it as sensationalistic. Bursting into tears, Jo reveals that she feels abandoned by Laurie and hurt that Aunt March, who had long promised her a trip to Europe, has taken Amy instead. After consoling Jo, with whom he has fallen in love, Professor Bhaer advises her to write from her heart, and Jo decides to return home where she is needed, for Beth is again very ill. Upon her return to the now nearly empty March household, Jo learns that her beloved Beth is dying and spends the next few weeks caring for the courageous girl, who bears her suffering without complaint.\n\nAfter Beth's death, Jo assuages her grief by writing a novel entitled \"My Beth\", which she sends to Professor Bhaer for his opinion. Later, Meg, now the mother of twins, gently informs Jo that Laurie and Amy have fallen in love in Europe and are to be married. Although Jo is happy for the couple, she realizes for the first time how lonely she is and how much she wishes to be loved. A few weeks later, Laurie and Amy return as husband and wife, and the Marches joyfully celebrate the family's reunion. The festivities are interrupted when Professor Bhaer arrives with Jo's novel, which he has had published. However, when Laurie answers the door, Bhaer mistakenly assumes that Jo has married her friend; he politely declines Laurie's invitation to join the party, and departs. After Jo catches up to him, the two embrace and he proposes marriage. Jo happily accepts, then leads her future husband back to the warmth of the house, where her family awaits them.\n\n\n\"with:\"\n\nUncredited\nDavid O. Selznick was originally going to produce the film. Filming began in September 1946 but Selznick decided he could not tackle a major production so soon after the ordeal of filming \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946) so he sold the property and script to MGM. The cast for the David O. Selznick version included Jennifer Jones (Jo), Diana Lynn (Amy), Bambi Linn (Beth), Rhonda Fleming (Meg) and Anne Revere (Marmee).\n\n\nOriginally intended as a 1948 release, the premiere of \"Little Women\" was delayed until March 1949, when it was presented as the Easter attraction at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. It is believed that the reason for the delay was to make the movie part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Silver Anniversary Celebration.\n\n\"Little Women\" became one of the top-grossing films of 1949. According to MGM records it earned $3,425,000 in the US and Canada, and $2,495,000 overseas resulting in a profit of $812,000.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the first part of the film was \"a pretty agreeable assortment of period fun and sentiment\", but the latter part \"got away from the scriptwriters\" with a \"perceptible deflation\" in its spirit once it became serious. Of June Allyson's performance, Crowther wrote that \"Comparisons of course, are odious, but if memory serves us well, she can't hold a bayberry candle to the Jo of Katharine Hepburn of fifteen years ago.\" John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that unlike the previous film version, the remake left him \"dry-eyed\" and agreed that Allyson \"tries hard to be as diverting as Miss Hepburn was years ago, even to the extent of imitating her peculiar vocalizations every now and then, but somehow she isn't quite as persuasive as her predecessor.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" called the film \"wholesome entertainment, with great sentimental appeal,\" but \"beautiful as it is in its old-fashioned charm, human appeal, and comedy situations, its oozing sentiment, judged by present standards, seems out of tune.\" A mostly positive review in \"Variety\" praised LeRoy's direction as \"tasteful\" and, while agreeing that the Victorian sentiment of the book was \"too meticulously preserved\" in the film and \"a bit out of joint with our times,\" found that Allyson's performance \"dominates the film\" and \"shows that there is meat in the role for more than one actress.\"\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 71% \"Fresh\" rating, based on five out of seven surveyed critics providing a positive review.\n\n\nTurner Classic Movies presented \"Little Women\" on October 7, 2015 in commemoration of what would have been June Allyson's 98th birthday. Shown before \"Little Women\" was 1946's \"The Secret Heart\", 1945's \"The Sailor Takes a Wife\", 1946's \"Two Sisters from Boston\", 1947's \"Good News\", and 1948's \"The Bride Goes Wild\".

{"id": "2175646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175646", "title": "Norris Locomotive Works", "text": "Norris Locomotive Works\n\nThe Norris Locomotive Works was a steam locomotive manufacturing company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that produced nearly one thousand railroad engines between 1832 and 1866. It was the dominant American locomotive producer during most of that period, as well as the first major exporter of American locomotives, selling its popular 4-2-0 engines to railways in Europe and building the first locomotive used in South America.\n\nThe company was started in 1832 as the American Steam Carriage Company by William Norris (1802-1867) and Major Stephen H. Long (1784-1864), a military topographical engineer and explorer. The two men had experimented with steam engine building for years and, as early as 1829, designed a locomotive to burn anthracite coal. Norris and Long also built an engine called the \"Black Hawk\", which performed with partial success on the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad in the early 1830s. Major Long later left the firm and William Norris was joined by his brother Septimus, who patented several locomotive-related inventions. The two brothers reformed the enterprise into the Norris Locomotive Works.\n\nOne of the most historic events in railroading history occurred on July 10, 1836, when the Norris Brothers ran a test of a 4-2-0 locomotive on the Belmont Inclined Plane of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad. (The two-track incline ran from the Schuylkill River for 2,805 feet towards present-day Belmont Avenue, rising one foot in 15 for a total of 187 feet.) Named \"George Washington\", the 14,400 pound engine hauled a load of 19,200 pounds (including 24 people riding on the tender and a freight car) up the grade at 15 miles per hour. This engine, the first in the world to ascend a hill by its own power, proved that a steam locomotive could climb a grade while pulling a load. So remarkable was this accomplishment that reports published in engineering journals emphatically doubted its occurrence. A second, more formal trial with an even greater load proved the engine's capabilities on July 19, 1836. Norris 4-2-0s were exported to England for the Lickey Incline about 1842, English manufacturers having declined to supply.\n\nNorris built the \"Lafayette\" for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad the following year based on plans of the \"George Washington\". Named after the Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette, this new 4-2-0 engine was the B&O's first locomotive to feature a leading truck and may have been the first standardized production model locomotive in the entire world. Innovations included positioning of cylinders outside and adjacent to the smokebox with pistons connecting to the face of the drive wheels instead of a crank axle, the four-wheel swiveling pilot truck, inside bar frame support, and placement of the two drivers ahead of the firebox (this supposedly offered greater power output as more of the locomotive's weight rested on the drivers and therefore increased tractive effort). The \"Lafayette\" established the configuration that American steam locomotives would follow until the end of the steam era.\nIn 1847, the Norris Works built the first ten-wheel locomotive in America: the \"Chesapeake\". Operated by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, this was also the world's first 4-6-0 locomotive. It weighed 22 tons and had 14½ by 22 inch cylinders and driving wheels 46 inches in diameter. Initially a wood-burning locomotive, the \"Chesapeake\" was converted to burn anthracite coal in 1862, and ran for about another fifteen years. Some authorities claim that Septimus Norris came up with the design, but other sources attribute it to master builder John Brandt of the Erie Railway.\n\nThere were nine Norris brothers altogether, six of them had been involved in locomotive building at some point. William Norris' enterprise was renamed Norris Brothers when brothers Richard and Octavius joined it in 1844 during a period of financial distress and reorganization that included William's gradual departure from the business. The firm later became Richard Norris and Son. Other locomotive factories, operated independently (and unsuccessfully) by various Norris brothers later opened in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Schenectady, New York.\nThe Norris Locomotive Works sold many locomotives overseas, as noted above. This company was the first American exporter of locomotives—and perhaps of large mechanical devices generally. As early as 1840, thirty percent of the firm's production until then had been for foreign markets. Norris machines operated in England, France, the states of the German Confederation (including Prussia, Austria and Saxony), Belgium, Italy, Canada, Cuba and South America. (\"\", built in 1850 for Chilean Railroad, was the first locomotive in all of South America.) These engines influenced contemporary and subsequent locomotive design in many of these countries.\n\nWilliam Norris had several large-scale operating models constructed as presentation pieces to rulers of several nations. Such sovereigns included Tsar Nicholas of Russia and King Louis-Philippe of France, who was so pleased with his model that he gave Norris a gold medal and a handsome gold box. A quarter-sized 4-4-0 locomotive and tender were built for Commodore Matthew C. Perry to deliver as a gift on his second expedition to Japan in 1854. A small circular railway—which also included a miniature passenger car made by another manufacturer and a mile of track—was set up near Yokohama. The Japanese soon could take the first train ride available in the Far East.\n\nRichard Norris and Son was the largest locomotive maker in the United States, if not the world, during the 1850s. Employing many hundreds of men, the factory consisted of some ten buildings spread over several city blocks at what is now the campus of the Community College of Philadelphia. The firm reached its peak in 1857-58, after which time, the Norris family seems to have lost interest in the business. Manufacturing quality and output fell during the Civil War and the plant closed in 1866, although deliveries continued for a year or two.\n\nThe firm's factory complex was located in the area around 17th and Hamilton Streets, on several acres of what had once been the famous Bush Hill estate of Andrew Hamilton, used as a hospital during the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793. The site was near the right-of-way of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, which crossed through that part of Philadelphia just north of Callowhill Street. (This route was later owned by the Reading Railroad.)\n\nThe property lay idle until the adjacent Baldwin Locomotive Works (which had surpassed Norris as the largest locomotive builder in the US) acquired the site in 1873. The Norris buildings stood until 1896, when part of the property was cleared for construction of the third United States Mint in Philadelphia. (Still standing, that building has been adapted as part of the Community College of Philadelphia.) Today, no trace of either the Norris or Baldwin factories remains in that part of Philadelphia.\n\n\n"}

From 1985 to 1992, she worked in private practice as a litigator for Whyte & Hirschboeck, a medium-sized law firm in Milwaukee. Sykes won election to a newly created trial judge seat on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 1992, serving in the misdemeanor, felony, and civil divisions. \n\nShe left the trial court in 1999 when she was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, to fill a vacancy for Justice Donald W.

{"id": "2175661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175661", "title": "Little Women (1933 film)", "text": "Little Women (1933 film)\n\nLittle Women is a 1933 American pre-Code drama film, directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Joan Bennett, Frances Dee and Jean Parker. The screenplay, by Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman, is based on the 1868-69 two-volume novel of the same name, by Louisa May Alcott. A sequel was released the following year, titled \"Little Men\".\n\nThis is the third screen adaptation of the book. It follows two silent versions, the first released in 1917 with Minna Grey and the second in 1918 with Dorothy Bernard. After this 1933 sound version came the 1949 \"Little Women\", with June Allyson, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Lawford, the 1994 film \"Little Women\", starring Winona Ryder, and the 2019 film \"Little Women\" featuring Saoirse Ronan.\n\nSet in Concord, Massachusetts, during and after the American Civil War, the film is a series of vignettes focusing on the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters and their mother, affectionately known as Marmee (Spring Byington), while they await the return of their father (Samuel S. Hinds), who serves as a colonel and a chaplain in the Union Army. Spirited tomboy Jo (Katharine Hepburn), who caters to the whims of their well-to-do Aunt March (Edna May Oliver), dreams of becoming a famous author, and she writes plays for her sisters to perform for the local children. Amy (Joan Bennett) is pretty but selfish, Meg (Frances Dee) works as a governess, and sensitive Beth (Jean Parker) practices on her clavichord, an aging instrument sorely in need of tuning.\n\nThe girls meet Laurie (Douglass Montgomery), who has come to live with his grandfather, Mr. Laurence (Henry Stephenson), the Marches' wealthy next-door neighbor. The Laurences invite them to a lavish party, where Meg meets Laurie's tutor, John Brooke (John Lodge). During the next several months John courts Meg, Jo's first short story becomes published, and Beth often takes advantage of Mr. Laurence's offer for her to practice on his piano.\n\nMarmee learns that her husband is recuperating in a hospital in Washington, D.C., after an injury, so she goes to Washington to care for him. During her absence Beth contracts scarlet fever from a neighbor's baby. She recovers, albeit in a weakened condition. The March parents return, and Meg marries John. Laurie confesses his love to Jo, who rejects him. When he snubs her in return, Jo moves to New York City to pursue her writing career, and she lives in a boarding house. There she meets Professor Bhaer (Paul Lukas), an impoverished German linguist. With his help and encouragement Jo improves her writing, and she resolves her confused feelings about Laurie.\n\nBeth, debilitated, is near to death, so Jo returns to Concord to be with Beth and her family during this time. After Beth dies, a grieving Jo learns that Amy, who accompanied Aunt March to Europe, has fallen in love with Laurie, accepted his proposal and they return, having married. Upon their return, Jo is happy for Laurie and Amy, indicating it has turned out as it always should have been. Professor Bhaer then arrives from New York City, and with him he brings Jo's manuscript for Little Women, which is soon to be published. He confesses his love to Jo and proposes. Jo accepts, welcoming him to the family.\n\n\nAlthough David O. Selznick received no screen credit, he returned to RKO from MGM to supervise the production as the last film left in his contract with the studio.\n\nThe prime goal of director George Cukor was to emphasize the juxtaposition between sacrifice and family life in \"Little Women\".\n\nAt Hepburn's request, costume designer Walter Plunkett created a dress for her character copied from one worn by her maternal grandmother in a tintype Hepburn had. Plunkett also had to redesign several of Joan Bennett's costumes to conceal her advancing pregnancy, a condition Bennett intentionally had not mentioned to Cukor when he cast her in the film. Plunkett designed all of the costumes very thoughtfully, purposely shuffling clothing items between the March sisters in different scenes to emphasize both the family bond of sisters sharing and the reality that each girl would only have so many clothes but an individual's closet could be drastically expanded by sharing with siblings.\n\nLouise Closser Hale originally was scheduled to portray Aunt March, but after her death on July 26, 1933, Edna May Oliver assumed the role.\n\nThe film was budgeted at $1 million, and 4,000 people worked on it during the yearlong production schedule. 3,000 separate items, including costumes, furnishings, and household appliances, were authenticated by research. Hobe Erwin, a former artist and interior decorator, was hired to oversee the set decoration, and he modeled the interior of the March home after Hillside, Louisa May Alcott's Massachusetts house. Exteriors were filmed at Lancaster's Lake in Sunland, Providencia Ranch in the Hollywood Hills, and the Warner Bros. Ranch in Pasadena. Original prints of the film employed the use of hand-coloring for fireplaces and candles.\n\nThe film opened on November 16, 1933, at Radio City Music Hall where, despite being the coldest November 16 for 50 years, broke opening day records with 23,073 people attending. It earned over $100,000 during its first week of release. A record 451,801 people attended the three week run at the Music Hall before it moved to RKO's Center Theatre where a further 250,000 people attended in four weeks. It was the fourth most popular movie at the US box office in 1933 with rentals of $1.3 million. Worldwide it made $2,000,000 and made a profit of $800,000.\n\nRKO's timing of release was impeccable, as Depression audiences were ripe for the film's evocation of life in a simpler, more innocent and auspicious world. In addition, the film business had come under fire in 1932 and 1933 for presenting an abundance of violent and sexually titillating material. This film was just the type that conservative people felt should be produced. They championed it, sent their children to see it, and made it part of school curricula.\n\nThe film was re-released in 1938 and earned an additional $70,000 in rentals and $49,000 in profit.\n\nThe film was released on DVD for Region 1 markets (US, Canada, and US territories) on November 6, 2001, by Warner Home Video. It is closed captioned and features an English audio track in Dolby Digital 1.0 and subtitles in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Georgian, and Chinese. The DVD also contains isolated scoring session cues\n(including alternate cues) from Max Steiner's score as a special feature.\n\n\"Little Women\" by Louisa May Alcott takes place in the midst of the Civil War (during the 1860s). By the time the 1933 film was made the United States was in the midst of Great Depression and would be fighting in World War II in the near future. References that were once meant to be about the Civil War became all too relatable for audiences. Especially at the beginning of the film, the constant emphasis on food, frugality, conservation, activism, social reform, and want for family and morality are just a short list of the ideals that transferred directly from the Civil War era to the mindsets of Americans in the Great Depression. Cukor's focus on hardship and relief partnered with intense familial commitment creates a nostalgic and sentimental picture of joyfulness, moral improvement, and social progression. The 1933 film became a trademark of  “an activist spirit grounded in unbreakable ties to family and community” as the March girls represent the hope and determination that was prominent during both the Civil War and the Great Depression.\n\nThe film was overwhelmingly praised by critics upon its release. Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"The easy-going fashion in which George Cukor, the director, has set forth the beguiling incidents in pictorial form is so welcome after the stereotyped tales with stuffed shirts. It matters not that this chronicle is without a hero, or even a villain, for the absence of such worthies, usually extravagantly drawn, causes one to be quite contented to dwell for the moment with human hearts of the old-fashioned days. The film begins in a gentle fashion and slips away smoothly without any forced attempt to help the finish to linger in the minds of the audience.\"\n\n\"Variety\" called it \"a superbly human document, sombre in tone, stately and slow in movement, but always eloquent in its interpretations.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" declared it \"an amazing triumph\", and \"a picture more intense, wrought with more feeling, than any other we are likely to see for a long time to come.\"\n\nThe \"New York World-Telegram\" credited the film \"a stunningly clever job of recapturing on the screen all the simplicity and charm of its author\", and wrote that Hepburn gave \"an unforgettably brilliant performance and that once and for all she definitely proves how unlimited and effortless an actress she really is.\"\n\nThe \"New York American\" wrote \"It is possible that with the passage of months the memory of Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of the sensitive, fiery Jo will be dimmed a bit, or somewhat superseded by later displays of histrionic genius. But at the moment, and for days, weeks, months to come, Miss Hepburn's characterization will stand alone on a pedestal of flaming brilliance.\"\n\n\"TV Guide\" rated the film four stars, calling it \"unabashedly sentimental\" and \"an example of Hollywood's best filmmaking.\" It added \"The sets, costumes, lighting, and direction by George Cukor all contribute greatly to this magnificent film, but the performances, especially Hepburn's, are what make the simple story so moving. There are laughs and tears aplenty in this movie, which presents a slice of American history in a way that children will find palatable. Released during the depths of the Depression, \"Little Women\" buoyed Americans' spirits. It still does.\"\n\nHusband-and-wife screenwriters Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture but lost to \"Cavalcade\", and George Cukor lost the Academy Award for Best Director to Frank Lloyd for his direction of that film.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175666", "title": "California Mental Health Services Act", "text": "California Mental Health Services Act\n\nOn November 2004, voters in the U.S. state of California passed Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), which has been designed to expand and transform California’s county mental health service systems. The MHSA is funded by imposing an additional one percent tax on individual, but not corporate, taxable income in excess of one million dollars. In becoming law on January 2005, the MHSA represents the latest in a Californian legislative movement, begun in the 1990s, to provide better coordinated and more comprehensive care to those with serious mental illness, particularly in underserved populations. Its claim of successes thus far, such as with the development of innovative and integrated Full Service Partnerships (FSPs), are not without detractors who highlight many problems but especially a lack of oversight, large amount of unspent funds, poor transparency, lack of engagement in some communities, and a lack of adherence to required reporting as challenges MHSA implementation must overcome to fulfill the law's widely touted potential.\n\nAt one time, California was known for having a strong mental health system. Treatment was available for Medi-Cal recipients with few limitations on care. Legislators and voters have acknowledged the inadequacy of California's historically underfunded mental health system to care for the state's residents, especially those with serious mental illness, over the past few decades. In 1991, to build a more community- and county-based system of care, the California legislature instituted realignment, a delegation of the control over mental health funds and care delivery from state to county. This was followed by a succession of legislation targeted towards marginalized populations with high documented rates of mental illness, such as the homeless (AB 2034, in 1999) and the potentially violent mentally ill (Laura's Law, in 2002).\nHowever, with the passage of Proposition 63 in 2004, California voters acted upon a widespread perception that state and county mental health systems were still in disrepair, underfunded, and requiring a systematic, organizational overhaul. This perception echoed a nationwide perspective, with the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health in 2003 calling for fundamental transformation of the historically fragmented mental health system. The MHSA is California's attempt to lead the way in accomplishing such systemic reform.\n\nIn the end, voter consciences were pricked by the well-organized and -funded campaign that displayed both the need (50,000 mentally ill homeless people, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness) and the promise (successes of past mental health initiatives) of increased funding for the mental health system. Then-Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg and Rusty Selix, executive director of the Mental Health Association in California, led the initiative by collecting at minimum 373,816 signatures, along with financial ($4.3 million) and vocal support from stakeholders. Though Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the business community were opposed to Proposition 63 because of the tax it would impose on millionaires, the opposition raised only $17,500. On November 2, 2004, Proposition 63 passed with 53.8% of the vote, with 6,183,119 voting for and 5,330,052 voting against the bill.\n\nThe voter-approved MHSA initiative provides for developing, through an extensive stakeholder process, a comprehensive approach to providing community based mental health services and supports for California residents. Approximately 51,000 taxpayers in California will be helping to fund the MHSA through an estimated $750 million in tax revenue during fiscal year 2005-06.\n\nThe MHSA was an unprecedented piece of legislation in California for several reasons:\n\nTo accomplish its objectives, the MHSA applies a specific portion of its funds to each of six system-building components:\n\nNotably, none of the funds were to be used for programs with existing fund allocations, unless it was for a new element or expansion in those existing programs. 51% of the funds have to be spent on children's service\n\nThe MHSA stipulates that the California State Department of Mental Health (DMH) will contract with county mental health departments (plus two cities) to develop and manage the implementation of its provisions. Oversight responsibility for MHSA implementation was handed over to the sixteen member Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) on July 7, 2005, when the commission first met.\n\nThe MHSA specifies requirements for service delivery and supports for children, youths, adults and older adults with serious emotional disturbances and/or severe mental illnesses. MHSA funding will be made annually to counties to:\n\nStarting from enactment, implementation of the MHSA was intended to take six months; in reality, the process of obtaining stakeholder input for administrative rules extended this period by several months. By August 2005, 12 meetings and 13 conference calls involving stakeholders across the state resulted in the final draft of rules by which counties would submit their three-year plans for approval.\n\nCounties are required to develop their own three-year plan, consistent with the requirements outlined in the act, in order to receive funding under the MHSA. Counties are obliged to collaborate with citizens and stakeholders to develop plans that will accomplish desired results through the meaningful use of time and capabilities, including things such as employment, vocational training, education, and social and community activities. Also required will be annual updates by the counties, along with a public review process. County proposals will be evaluated for their contribution to achieving the following goals:\n\nMHSA specifies three stages of local funding, to fulfill initial plans, three year plans, and long term strategies. No services would be funded in the first year of implementation. The DMH approved the first county plan in January 2006. Allocations for each category of funding were planned to be granted annually, based upon detailed plans with prior approval. However, an amendment to the MHSA, AB 100, which passed in March 2011, serves to streamline the DMH approval and feedback process to the counties, ostensibly to relieve the DMH of some of its administrative burden.\n\nWhile the county mental health departments are involved in the actual implementation of MHSA programs, the MHSA mandates that several entities support or oversee the counties. These include the State Department of Mental Health (DMH) and the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC).\n\nIn accordance with realignment, the DMH approves county three-year implementation plans, upon comment from the MHSOAC, and passes programmatic responsibilities to the counties. In the first few months immediately following its passage, the DMH has:\n\nThe DMH has directed all counties to develop plans incorporating five essential concepts:\n\nThe DMH, in assuming and asserting its primacy over MHSA implementation, has dictated requirements for service delivery and supports as follows:\n\nThe authors of the MHSA created the MHSOAC to reflect the consumer-oriented focus of the law, mandating at least two appointees with severe mental illness, two other family members of individuals with severe mental illness, and various other community representatives. This diverse commission holds the responsibility of approving county implementation plans, helping develop mental illness stigma-relieving strategies, and recommending service delivery improvements to the state on an as-needed basis. Whenever the commission identifies a critical issue related to the performance of a county mental health program, it may refer the issue to the DMH.\n\nThe first meeting of the MHSOAC was held July 7, 2005, at which time Proposition 63 author Darrell Steinberg was selected unanimously by fellow commissioners as chairman, without comment or discussion. After accepting the gavel, Steinberg was roundly praised for devising Proposition 63's 'creative financing' scheme. Steinberg then said, \"We must focus on the big picture,\" and stated his priorities with regard to the implementation of the MHSA:\n\nIn accordance with MHSA requirements, the Commission shall consist of 16 voting members as follows:\n\n\nThe initial government officials and designee appointed:\n\n\nOn June 21, 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger announced his appointment of twelve appointees to the MHSOAC:\n\n\nOne unqualified success story from the MHSA thus far involves the implementation of Full Service Partnerships (FSPs) demonstrating the \"whatever it takes\" commitment to assist in individualized recovery - whether it is housing, \"integrated services, flexible funding [such as for childcare], intensive case management, [or] 24 h access to care.\" FSP interventions are based upon evidence from such programs as Assertive community treatment (ACT), which has effectively reduced homelessness and hospitalizations while bettering outcomes. But the FSP model looks more like that of the also-popular MHA Village in Long Beach, which is a center that offers more comprehensive services besides those specifically mental health-related. Beyond these guiding principles, however, there has not been much consensus over unifying strategies to define and implement an FSP - resulting in varying FSP structures across counties.\n\nOverall, though, the Petris Center, funded by the DMH and California HealthCare Foundation to evaluate the MHSA, has reported quantifiable improvements in many areas:\n\nAccording to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Surveys (CHIS) demonstrate continued mental health needs of almost two million Californians, about half of which were unmet in 2011. In spite of steady tax revenue ($7.4 billion raised as of September 2011) earmarked for the MHSA, the unremittingly high numbers of mentally ill who lack treatment contrast starkly with the implementation of new programs like the FSPs, which may cost tens of thousands of dollars annually per person. The MHA Village program, for example, averages around $18,000 annually per person. One of the major growing concerns regarding MHSA implementation is its unintentional but worrying tendency to create silos of care. As directed by the DMH, counties search for \"unserved\" mentally ill or at-risk individuals to enroll in their new programs, while keeping existing and perhaps underserved clients in old programs that are usually underfunded, but cannot take MHSA funds. Ironically, while the MHSA was established in part to address racial/ethnic disparities in health care, it may be perpetuating the disparity in services delivery between underfunded and well-funded, new programs.\n\nA possible solution to this issue highlights another challenge for the MHSA: the need for more comprehensive evaluation, oversight, and advisory mechanisms. Though there is an accountability commission, the MHSOAC, its oversight and regulatory responsibilities are not well-defined. However, it is a relatively new entity, having been created by the MHSA in 2004, and has yet to fully delineate its role in the MHSA. With time, the MHSOAC will hopefully continue to develop towards its stated function. Objective and expert evaluation of the MHSA will also be necessary to achieve the kind of longstanding system-wide improvement that then becomes a model for others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located 10 nautical miles (12 mi, 19 km) southeast of the central business district of Silver City, New Mexico. The airport is mostly used for general aviation, but is also served by one commercial airline. Service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\nIt is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"non-primary commercial service\" airport (between 2,500 and 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nGrant County Airport covers an area of 740 acres (299 ha) at an elevation of 5,446 feet (1,660 m) above mean sea level. It has four runways, including one asphalt paved runway 8/26 measuring 6,802 by 100 feet (2,073 x 30 m). The remaining three runways have dirt surfaces: 17/35 is 5,473 by 75 feet (1,668 x 23 m), 12/30 is 4,675 by 75 feet (1,425 x 23 m), and 3/21 is 4,537 by 80 feet (1,383 x 24 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018, the airport had 5,675 aircraft operations, an average of 16 per day: 63% general aviation, 22% scheduled commercial, <1% air taxi, and <1% military. At that time there were 26 aircraft based at this airport: 81% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, and <1% helicopter.\n\nAdvanced Air operates Raytheon King Air 350 turboprop aircraft on all flights. The aircraft has eight seats arranged in an executive configuration.\n\nThe Grant County Airport was dedicated on November 30, 1951, serving the communities of Silver City, Hurley, Lordsburg and Deming, New Mexico, as well as smaller communities in the so-called \"Mining District,\" including Arenas Valley, Fort Bayard, Central (now Santa Clara), Bayard, and Santa Rita.The next day, on December 1, Frontier Airlines began operating flights from the airport as a stop on their route from El Paso to Phoenix, which also included stops at Clifton, Safford, and Tucson, Arizona. Before the opening of the Grant County Airport, the airline was serving local airports in Deming, NM and Lordsburg, NM; however, service to those cities was then discontinued. By 1956 the route was modified to originate in Albuquerque rather than El Paso and service to Clifton and Safford was then discontinued. At that time and on into the mid-1960s, the airline was flying the Douglas DC-3. Later, Frontier served the airport with larger Convair 340 prop aircraft followed by Convair 580 turboprops. Frontier's flights to Tucson and Phoenix were discontinued in 1974 and a small commuter carrier, Zia Airlines, began flights to Albuquerque with Handley Page Jetstream propjets in 1976. In the midst of growing into an all jet airline, Frontier ended their service in late 1979. Zia Airlines went out of business in early 1980 and Air Midwest began operating later that year with flights to Albuquerque using Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. Another commuter, Airways of New Mexico, operated flights to El Paso for a short time in 1980 as well. Mesa Airlines came to Silver City with Beechcraft 99 and Beechcraft 1900D aircraft from Albuquerque in 1985 at which time Air Midwest ended their service. Mesa's flights continued for 20 years until an Essential Air Service (EAS) contract was awarded to Great Lakes Airlines in 2005. Great Lakes started service with flights to Albuquerque, also using Beech 1900D's, but switched the flights to Phoenix in late 2012. Great Lakes ended all service in late 2014 and the EAS contract was then awarded to Boutique Air which began service in early 2015. Boutique provided flights to both Albuquerque and Phoenix using Pilatus PC-12 aircraft for four years until the EAS contract was then transferred to Advanced Air. Advanced Air began service in early 2019 with similar service to Albuquerque and Phoenix but uses a larger, multi engine, Beechcraft Super King Air model 350. Two other commuter airlines that served the Silver City to El Paso market for short periods of time include Aztec Airlines in 1966 and Turner Air in 1985.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175679", "title": "Clyno", "text": "Clyno\n\nClyno Engineering Company, later Clyno Engineering Company (1922) Ltd, was a motorcycle and car manufacturer that operated in Thrapston from 1909 to 1910 and then in Wolverhampton from 1910 to 1929. During this time they produced over 15,000 motorcycles and between 36,000 and 40,000 cars, at one point becoming Britain's third largest car manufacturer.\n\nClyno was founded in 1909 by the cousins Frank and Ailwyn Smith. The company took its name for the pulley designed for belt-driven machines which was known as the \"inclined pully\", becoming abbreviated to the \"clined\" and then Clyno. The cousins' original workshop was in their hometown of Thrapston, Northamptonshire.\n\nIn 1910 the opportunity arose for Clyno to purchase a factory in Wolverhampton. The factory belonged to the Stevens Brothers who had supplied engines to Clyno previously but had entered voluntary liquidation in 1910 leading them to seek a sale. The purchase by Clyno was completed on 15 October 1910 and the company transferred from Thrapston to Wolverhampton. The company exhibited for the first time at the 1910 motorcycle show at Olympia, displaying motorcycles, adjustable pulleys and telescopic stands.\n\nClyno continued to exhibit at every possible trials attracting attention by taking on hills previously thought unclimbable. This attention brought business to the company with orders in excess of manufacturing capacity in 1912. The same year the company took over the unoccupied Humber cycle factory which was on the other side of Pelham Street from their original factory.\n\nThe company's success proved to be something of a double-edged sword as the constant pressure to perform at trials required constant development, pushing the company beyond its financial means. It was decided that the company needed to produce an affordable motorcycle which they did in 1913, releasing a 250cc motorcycle, one of the first to be sold fully ready for the road. Exhibited at the 1913 motor cycle show the model was a major success.\n\nAs with many manufacturers, the First World War was a time of prosperity for Clyno. Together with Vickers they created a |motor cycle with machine gun attachment, which was produced in large numbers. The choice of Clyno over its competitors as supplier of the standard motorcycle combination outfit for the Motor Machine Gun Service was made in 1915, and is said to have been a decision taken by Winston Churchill. At the Armistice in 1918, there were 1,792 Clyno motorcycles in the possession of the British armed forces: 1,150 at home, and 642 overseas, including 478 in France. Clyno also signed an agreement with the Russian war commission to supply their army on top of their business with the British forces.\n\nIn 1916 the relationship between Frank and Ailwyn became strained, and Ailwyn departed the company in June. Clyno continued to supply the war effort providing mobile machine gun units, ammunition carriers and building dragonfly aircraft engines. The company also designed a new motorcycle, the \"Spring 8\", which had a top speed of 50 mph, although it was two years before it went into production.\n\nAfter the war, the motorcycle industry collapsed and Clyno's Works Manager Henry Meadows departed the company to found his own. A large number of cheap motor cycles no longer needed by the army were sold, undercutting the prices of Clyno's machines. There was also a shortage of materials with which to produce new models and to compound Clyno's problems the Russians failed to pay for the motorcycles they received during the war which led to the withdrawal of financial backing. In 1920 the Clyno Engineering Company went into liquidation.\n\nIn 1922 Frank Smith decided to resurrect the company under the name Clyno Engineering Company (1922) Ltd. Frank became managing director while his father William was chairman. Frank decided to focus more on car production and although motorcycle production did continue alongside car production by 1923 it had ended. The company continued its trials policy, winning two gold medals in the 1923 London to Edinburgh Trial.\nClyno debuted its first car at the 1922 motor show. The mainstay throughout their existence, the 10.8, designed by AG Booth had a 1368 cc 4-cylinder side-valve Coventry Climax model F engine fitted a Cox Atmos carburettor a 3-speed gearbox and sold for £250. Initially no differential was fitted but this was soon added. From 1926 four-wheel brakes were standardised. It was renowned for its reliability and economy. About 35,000 are thought to have been made including some sports versions and de luxe Royal models.\n\nA slightly bigger model, the 13 (later 12/28), but still with the same 8 feet 9 inch wheelbase was introduced in 1924 using Clyno's own engine which had a 69 mm bore, 3 mm more than the 10.8 but the same 100 mm stroke. About 8,000 were made.\n\nThe company was determined to offer cheaper prices than its competitors and was rewarded by soaring sales. Between 1923 and 1924 sales increased 770% with the release of popular models such as the 'Weymann' saloon and the 'Royal 2' tourer. In October 1925 the company released their 13 hp. car which again proved to be a popular model. Clyno continued to slash prices and sales rose 260% between 1924 and 25 and by 210% between 25 and 26. At its peak in 1926 the company produced 350 cars a week, with workers operating day and night to meet demand.\n\nAt the end of 1926 Clyno launched the Cowley Saloon which sold for just £199.20. At this point Clyno were the third largest car manufacturer in the country, behind Austin and Morris, and they decided to expand their operation by opening a new plant in Bushbury and introducing two new models. The 12/35 had the engine bored out to 69.5 mm to increase the capacity to 1593 cc, presumably to cater for heavier coachwork, although most of these chassis seem to have carried fabric bodies.\n\nDespite the record sales and the new Bushbury plant, Clyno's financial situation in 1927 was precarious. The company was under capitalised and had survived this far on bank loans, such as the one taken out for the purchase of the land for the Bushbury plant. Clyno's product range needed updating to keep up with their competitors but the move to Bushbury had led to a decrease in production. Despite this Clyno continued to attempt to produce cheaper models releasing the small fabric bodied 'Nine' with a 951 cc engine in 1928 with a retail price of just £160.\n\nIn an attempt to minimise costs, Clyno ended their agreement with their long term partner Rootes and stopped using Coventry Climax engines in favour of concentrating on the Hillman design and this hastened the demise of Clyno. The repercussions of these moves were seen in the failure of Clyno's \"Century\" model which effectively sounded the death knell for the company.\n\nThe development of the \"Century\" seemed to be part of Clyno's ongoing price war with Morris as it was announced only a week after the Morris Minor. However it proved to be a step too far and only 300 of the \"Century\" model were ever produced. The car was intended to sell for £112.20, a price which annoyed Clyno's new dealers as the profit margin had been completely squeezed. Critically the \"Century\" was deemed to be cheap and shoddy, earning the unflattering nickname, the \"cemetery\". The combination of the depression of the late 1920s and severe competition coming from the Austin 7 and Morris Minor led to a severe sales slump.\n\nClyno had lost the price war with Morris, unable to offer both the value and performance that Morris could. Production costs had been pared back to the bare minimum meaning there was nowhere left to go price-wise. The failure of the \"Century\" destroyed Clyno's reputation which they had relied upon to get loans on order to fund their business. Without this there was little scope for improvement to Clyno's models and funds quickly began to dry up. On 11 February 1929 a receiver was appointed and in September the company was wound up. The company's assets were eventually acquired by Birmingham company R.H. Collier while the 'Nine' design was taken to fellow Wolverhampton manufacturer AJS by A.G. Booth.\n\nHowever, their Wolverhampton factory remains in existence more than 80 years, now used by an engineering firm who have extended the building substantially.\n\nUnfortunately, while the front of the old Stephens factory known as the \"Fort Works\" still exists the other side of the works known as the \"Ashes\" or \"Tower Works\" has been demolished. The plant in Bushbury has long since ceased to exist.\n\n\n"}

He was the founder of Tennessee Temple University and Temple Baptist Seminary in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Camp Joy, in Harrison, Tennessee.\n\nRoberson was born in a two-room log cabin and spent his first two years on a farm near English, Indiana, a small town in the southern part of the state. Originally named Leverne Edward, he was known throughout his life as \"Lee.\" In 1911, his parents, Charles E. and Dora (Sego) Roberson, took him to a farm near Louisville, Kentucky, where his father farmed, worked on streetcars, and built homes to make a living. In 1923, at the age of fourteen, he was led to the Lord by his Sunday School teacher, Mrs. Daisy Hawes, and joined the Cedar Creek Baptist Church near Louisville.\n\nAfter spending two years at the Louisville Male High School, where he received a diploma in public accounting when he was fourteen years old, Roberson then attended the Fern Creek High School, where he played football and graduated after four years.\n\nRoberson entered Old Bethel College in Russellville, Kentucky, in 1926, and completed one year there. There he worked at various jobs from washing dishes to scrubbing floors to pay his way. From Old Bethel College, he went to the University of Louisville to complete his college work with a major in history. He also continued his education at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, where he studied under Dr. A.T. Robertson. At the age of nineteen, he was called by a church in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, but he did not accept.\n\nIn his early years, Roberson was well known as a singer. Having studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and with the well-known teacher, John Samples, of Chicago, his services as a vocalist were in great demand. He served as a soloist on the staff of radio station WHAS of Louisville and WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. Roberson was offered a contract by Gaetano Salvatore de Luca at the Nashville Conservatory of Music. After a discussion with de Luca, Roberson decided to give up musical performance, and declined on the grounds that such a music career was not in accordance with his divine calling to the ministry.\n\nThe first church that Roberson served as pastor was in Germantown, Tennessee, while he was in college. In 1932, he was called to be pastor of the Temple Baptist Church in Greenbrier, Tennessee. It was there that he began emphasizing the Second Coming of Christ. After three years with the Greenbrier church, Roberson entered full-time evangelistic work in 1935. He served as evangelist of the Birmingham Baptist Association. Within two years he had conducted some fifty revivals in the Birmingham area.\n\nIn Birmingham, he met Caroline Allen, who, on October 9, 1937, became Mrs. Lee Roberson.\n\nOn the first Sunday in November 1937, Roberson became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Fairfield, Alabama.\n\nIn 1939, Roberson was asked to be the state evangelist for Alabama, but he declined.\n\nAfter five years with the Fairfield church, Roberson was called by the Highland Park Baptist Church in Chattanooga in November 1942. Four years later, Roberson founded Tennessee Temple University and Zion College. Two years later in 1948, a theological seminary, Southeastern Baptist Seminary (later renamed Temple Baptist Seminary in 1954) was added. His ministry would continue to branch out to radio, a citywide bus ministry, and the founding of Camp Joy. Highland Park Baptist Church would grow, at one point, to be one of the largest churches in the United States.\n\nHe preached his last service as pastor of Highland Park Baptist Church on April 27, 1983, but continued preaching across the nation and publishing many books. He continued this work until his death.\n\nRoberson died on April 29, 2007, two years after his wife's death.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2175688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175688", "title": "Maleic acid", "text": "Maleic acid\n\nMaleic acid or \"cis\"-butenedioic acid is an organic compound that is a dicarboxylic acid, a molecule with two carboxyl groups. Its chemical formula is HOCCH=CHCOH. Maleic acid is the \"cis\"-isomer of butenedioic acid, whereas fumaric acid is the \"trans\"-isomer. It is mainly used as a precursor to fumaric acid, and relative to its parent maleic anhydride, maleic acid has few applications.\n\nMaleic acid has a \"heat of combustion\" of -1,355 kJ/mol., 22.7 kJ/mol higher than that of fumaric acid. Maleic acid is more soluble in water than fumaric acid. The melting point of maleic acid (135 °C) is also much lower than that of fumaric acid (287 °C). Both properties of maleic acid can be explained on account of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that takes place in maleic acid at the expense of intermolecular interactions, and that are not possible in fumaric acid for geometric reasons.\n\nIn industry, maleic acid is derived by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride, the latter being produced by oxidation of benzene or butane.\n\nMaleic acid is an industrial raw material for the production of glyoxylic acid by ozonolysis.\n\nMaleic acid may be used to form acid addition salts with drugs to make them more stable, such as indacaterol maleate.\n\nMaleic acid is also used as an adhesion promoter for different substrates, such as nylon and zinc coated metals e.g galvanized steel, in methyl methacrylate based adhesives.\n\nThe major industrial use of maleic acid is its conversion to fumaric acid. This conversion, an isomerization, is catalysed by a variety of reagents, such as mineral acids and thiourea. Again, the large difference in water solubility makes fumaric acid purification easy.\n\nThe isomerization is a popular topic in schools. Maleic acid and fumaric acid do not spontaneously interconvert because rotation around a carbon carbon double bond is not energetically favourable. However, conversion of the \"cis\" isomer into the \"trans\" isomer is possible by photolysis in the presence of a small amount of bromine. Light converts elemental bromine into a bromine radical, which attacks the alkene in a radical addition reaction to a bromo-alkane radical; and now single bond rotation is possible. The bromine radicals recombine and fumaric acid is formed. In another method (used as a classroom demonstration), maleic acid is transformed into fumaric acid through the process of heating the maleic acid in hydrochloric acid solution. Reversible addition (of H) leads to free rotation about the central C-C bond and formation of the more stable and less soluble fumaric acid.\n\nSome bacteria produce the enzyme maleate isomerase, which is used by bacteria in nicotinate metabolism. This enzyme catalyses isomerization between fumarate and maleate.\n\nAlthough not practised commercially, maleic acid can be converted into maleic anhydride by dehydration, to malic acid by hydration, and to succinic acid by hydrogenation (ethanol / palladium on carbon). It reacts with thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride to give the maleic acid chloride (it is not possible to isolate the mono acid chloride). Maleic acid, being electrophilic, participates as a dienophile in many Diels-Alder reactions.\n\nThe maleate ion is the ionized form of maleic acid. The maleate ion is useful in biochemistry as an inhibitor of transaminase reactions. Maleic acid esters are also called maleates, for instance dimethyl maleate.\n\nMany drugs that contain amines are provided as the maleate acid salt, e.g. carfenazine, chlorpheniramine, pyrilamine, methylergonovine, and thiethylperazine.\n\n"}

The facility opened in April, 1959 and is mostly used for general aviation, but is also served by one commercial airline. Current scheduled passenger service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\nIt is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"general aviation\" airport (the \"commercial service\" category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year).\n\nClovis Municipal Airport covers an area of 1,480 acres (599 ha) at an elevation of 4,216 feet (1,285 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways, two of which have asphalt surfaces: 4/22 is 7,200 by 150 feet (2,195 x 46 m) and 12/30 is 5,697 by 150 feet (1,736 x 46 m). It also has one turf runway designated 8/26 which measures 2,442 by 75 feet (744 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending February 28, 2019; the airport had 24,648 aircraft operations, an average of 68 per day: 85% general aviation, 7% military and 8% air taxi. At that time there were 56 aircraft based at this airport: 73% single-engine, 14% multi-engine, 11% jet, and 2% helicopter.\n\nClovis was a stop on the first coast to coast \"air rail\" service between Los Angeles and New York City which began in 1929. Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT) used a Ford Trimotor aircraft to fly passengers between Los Angeles and Clovis with en route stops at Kingman and Winslow, AZ as well as Albuquerque, NM. At Clovis, passengers heading east would then transfer to and board an overnight train operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to Waynoka, OK where they would connect to another TAT operated Ford Trimotor aircraft the next morning and continue their journey to Port Columbus, OH where they would transfer again for the final stage of the journey to New York City via the Pennsylvania Railroad. The same rail and flight services, transfers and connecting points were used by passengers heading west. In late-1930 the service had been modified to where the aircraft would fly the western portion of the service with a stop in Amarillo, TX rather than Clovis. Transcontinental Air Transport went on to merge with Western Air Express and form what would become Trans World Airlines (TWA).\n\nIn 1948 a new carrier, Pioneer Airlines, began serving Clovis with the airport being one of several stops on a route between Albuquerque and Dallas. The other stops included Santa Fe, Las Vegas, and Tucumcari, NM as well as Lubbock, Abilene, Mineral Wells, and Ft. Worth, TX. A second route was created between Amarillo and El Paso with stops at Clovis, Roswell, and Las Cruces, New Mexico. This route crossed at Clovis with the initial route between Albuquerque and Dallas so as to make Clovis a small hub where passengers were able to connect between the two routes. Initially the airline used 21-seat Douglas DC-3 aircraft but upgraded to the 36-seat Martin 2-0-2 in 1952.\n\nIn 1955 Pioneer was acquired by and merged into Continental Airlines which maintained the same route, minus some of the stops, and also upgraded its service with Convair 340 prop aircraft followed by the four-engine, British manufactured Vickers Viscount turboprop in 1959. According to the September 27, 1959 Continental Airlines system timetable, the Viscount was being operated on a routing of Dallas Love Field-Fort Worth (via Greater Southwest International Airport)-Abilene-Lubbock-Clovis-Santa Fe-Albuquerque. Initially, all airline service had been operated via the current Cannon Air Force Base and was then transferred to the present municipal airport which opened in April, 1959.\n\nAs Continental was growing into a major airline, they transferred all of their Clovis service as well as service to other smaller cities in New Mexico to Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) in 1963. Trans-Texas again kept the same routing with flights to Albuquerque and Dallas originally reverting to DC-3 aircraft but later upgrading to Convair 240 prop aircraft followed by Convair 600 turboprops. TTa then changed its name to Texas International Airlines (TI) in 1969 and for a brief period during the late 1970s, TI introduced 85-seat Douglas DC-9-10 jet service to Clovis. This was the only time Clovis had jet service which was operated via the Cannon AFB airfield in order to accommodate the DC-9's. In 1978 Texas International reverted to using Convair-600's via the Clovis Municipal Airport with service only being flown to Albuquerque.\n\nAs Texas International was now growing into a larger all-jet airline, TI discontinued its flights in early 1979 and service was transferred to two smaller commuter airlines, Air Midwest and Crown Aviation. Crown had started service at Clovis two years prior with flights to Albuquerque and Lubbock but went out of business in 1980. Air Midwest used 17-seat Swearingen Metroliner propjets with flights to Albuquerque, Amarillo, and Wichita. Mesa Airlines began serving Clovis in 1985 using Beechcraft 99 followed by Beechcraft 1900 turboprop airliners on flights to Albuquerque. Air Midwest discontinued their service shortly afterwards. Mesa continued to serve the city for 20 years until 2005 when service was replaced by Great Lakes Aviation which operated flights to Albuquerque as well as a flight to Amarillo and Denver using Beechcraft 1900D turboprops. The flight to Amarillo was later dropped and all service was briefly shifted to a Clovis-Santa Fe-Denver route in 2012 before Great Lakes ended all flights on January 31, 2014. Clovis was without any airline service until July, 2014 when Boutique Air inaugurated three daily nonstop flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth using 8-seat Pilatus PC-12 aircraft via a federal Essential Air Service contract. In August, 2018, Boutique Air upgraded the aircraft used to multi-engine, 9-seat Beechcraft Super King Air model 350's. Boutique Air's EAS contract ended on May 1, 2020 at which time Key Lime Air dba Denver Air Connection began two daily flights to Denver using Fairchild Dornier 328Jet aircraft. \n\n"}

Federal grants helped pay for paved runways and taxiways and a terminal building for the renamed Hobbs Municipal Airport.\n\nThe first air mail arrived in Hobbs via Continental Airlines in May 1940 which started passenger flights that year to Albuquerque, El Paso, San Antonio, and Tulsa, each making several stops en route. Service was started using Lockheed Electras and Lodestars, later upgraded to Douglas DC-3's and Convair 340s. As Hobbs was a crossroads on Continental's routes from Albuquerque to San Antonio and from El Paso to Tulsa in the 1950s, passengers were able to change planes at Hobbs between the two routes. \n\nOwnership of the airport was transferred from the city of Hobbs to Lea County on November 19, 1945\n\nin 1963 Continental Airlines was replaced by Trans-Texas Airways (TTa). Supplemental service was provided by Bison Airlines in 1963–64. TTa also started with DC-3s but soon upgraded to Convair 600s. The name was later changed to Texas International Airlines (TI) and nonstop flights to Dallas TX were occasionally operated. For a brief time in 1977/1978 the airline introduced DC-9s to Hobbs but reverted to Convair 600s. TI's service ended in early 1979 being replaced by Crown Airlines with nonstop flights to Albuquerque and Air Midwest to Albuquerque and Lubbock. Crown Airlines ceased operating about a year later and Air Midwest switched the Lubbock flights to Midland/Odessa, TX. Mesa Airlines came to Hobbs in early 1984 with Beechcraft 99 flights to Albuquerque and Lubbock while Air Midwest left the city late that year. Mesa upgraded to Beechcraft 1900 airliners and was the mainstay air carrier at Hobbs for over 22 years until they were replaced by New Mexico Airlines in 2007 operating 9-seat Cessna 208 Caravans to Albuquerque, El Paso, and Midland/Odessa. The city was also briefly served Permian Airways in 1979 with flights to El Paso and Midland/Odessa, and by Big Sky Airlines in 2000/2001 first with nonstop flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth but later a stop in Brownwood, TX was added. New Mexico Airlines left Hobbs in early 2011 and new nonstop service to Houston Bush Airport by Continental Express was introduced on July 1, 2011 using 50-seat Embraer 145 regional jets. Continental Airlines merged into United Airlines in early 2012 changing the Hobbs flights to United Express. The contract carrier operating as United Express switched from ExpressJet to SkyWest Airlines and began flights to Denver on October 27, 2019.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked on some of the best-remembered 1960s television shows including \"Ivanhoe\", \"The Saint\", \"The Avengers\", \"Riptide\" and \"Doctor Who\".\n\nBorn in Australia, Bill Strutton won a state scholarship to university at 14 but dropped out after two years to go and work as an office clerk in Adelaide. At the outbreak of WWII he joined the Australian army. He was captured by the Germans in Crete and sent to Stalag VII, learning to swear in several languages. It was there he also began to take an interest in writing. He says: \"My first year as a prisoner-of-war was the most interesting in my life. The ensuing three were the most boring, but more instructive, I think, than any university. I learned several languages: German from a Serbian horse-doctor; Spanish from a Basque; a Parisian taxi-driver bequeathed me a startling vocabulary. I also ran a camp newspaper, caught up on my reading, and finally celebrated my liberation by tearing up a novel.\" After being demobbed, he lived in England. In 1961 he lived with his Australian wife and two children in Woddingham, East Surrey.\n\nAfter the war he took up journalism as a career and in the mid-fifties he began writing military books, including \"The Secret Invaders\", \"A Jury of Angels\" in 1957 and \"Island of Terrible Friends\" in 1961. Also, three films. In 1958 he scripted \"Ivanhoe\", which starred a young Roger Moore. He wrote for more than 15 television series in 11 years, the last of which was \"Strange Report\", starring Anthony Quayle, and several episodes of \"Paul Temple\" before retiring in 1978 following a heart attack.\n\nHis \"Doctor Who\" story was \"The Web Planet\" in 1965. It is remembered as a unique \"Doctor Who\" serial. It was the first programme to feature a completely alien cast, including Martin Jarvis as a butterfly Menoptera, and introduced the menacing Zarbi. Two of its six episodes are amongst the handful of Doctor Who instalments to be seen by more than 13m people on original transmission. Bill Strutton went on to adapt the serial as the third \"Doctor Who\" book in 1965.\n\nBill Strutton died on 23 November 2003, the day of \"Doctor Who\"'s 40th anniversary, aged 85 years.\n"}

It welcomes all Native American tribes of the Great Plains to its festivities, functioning as a \"giant family reunion under the Big Sky.\" Indeed, it is currently the largest Northern Native American gathering, attracting nearly 45,000 spectators and participants. Crow Fair is \"the teepee capital of the world, over 1,500 teepees in a giant campground,\" according to 2011 Crow Fair General Manager Austin Little Light.\n\nHeld annually the third week of August on land surrounding the Little Big Horn River near Billings, Montana, Crow Fair is very similar to a County Fair. It serves as a venue for the display of the region's arts and culture, from craft jewelry for sale to physical feats of dance.\n\nThe Crow Fair traditionally includes its own unique version of a parade.\n\nThe parade begins each morning of the Fair at ten o'clock. The Color Guard leads the parade with retired veterans and active members of the armed services. Following the Color Guard are the President, Vice-President, and First Vice-President of the Crow Fair. The President carries the American Flag. In the past, the royalty of the Crow Nation would follow the Presidents; however, in modern parades the Crow Tribal Officials replace Crow royalty.\n\nThe majority of participants in the parade are essentially members of the Crow Nation, dressed in traditional wear with eagle feathers, warbonnets, old-time saddles, western saddles, reservation hats, and extravagant beadwork. The beadwork of the Crow Nation is among the most technically proficient in the world.\n\nThe parade takes place on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the Crow Fair. The Sunday parade involves the greatest number of participants, and may extend as long as 1.5 miles in length.\n\nCrow Fair hosts one of several Dance Celebrations. The Crow Dance Celebration, commonly known as a pow-wow, is held every late afternoon and evening during the fair. The Crow Nation makes the distinction that dancing is the most fundamental form of celebration, as members may come to the dance arena simply for the pure joy elicited by dancing. However, pow-wows do often involve competition dancing.\n\nThe Crow Fair Rodeo is sponsored annually by the Crow Nation. The rodeo is a daily feature at the Crow Fair, offering a full day's entertainment of youth events, professional Indian cowboys and cowgirls, and horse racing. The Northern Plains Indian Rodeo Association, organized under the Indian National Finals Rodeo, is the current association that sanctions the rodeo event.\n\nThe Crow Fair Rodeo is held at the Edison Real Bird Memorial Complex, in Crow Agency, Montana. The rodeo arena, race track, stables, and campgrounds are all part of this complex.\n\nOn the last day of the Crow Fair week, the Crow Nation annually elects a new committee to organize the next Crow Fair Dance Celebration, Rodeo, and Racemeet. The Tuesday morning and afternoon is filled with campcriers and announcers telling the campgrounds via megaphone of the candidates. Campcriers are hired by candidates to notify the campground of their candidacy. Often, rumors are flying before and during the Crow Fair regarding which individuals will run for election for the committee.\n\n"}

The Bulb setting is distinct from shutter's Time (T) setting, which is an alternate-action mode where the shutter opens when the shutter-release button is pressed and released once, and closes when the button is actuated again.\n\nDecades before the first flashbulbs, some box cameras and many view cameras and folding cameras came with a detachable pneumatic shutter release with a rubber bulb on the end; \"Bulb\" refers to the rubber shutter release bulb. Though mechanically timed exposures could also be triggered by squeezing the shutter release bulb, \"Bulb\" exposures then had the same momentary action as camera shutters have today, as per this description from Sears Roebuck's 1909 \"Cameras [&] Photographic Supplies\":\n\nAround 1894 in Germany, the momentary-action setting on camera shutters made by C. A. Steinheil & Söhne in Munich were denoted with \"B\" but the literature referred to it as \"Beliebig\" (meaning \"beliebige Zeit\", ).\n\nThe Eastman Kodak Company sold entry level consumer cameras that did not have the option of a pneumatic shutter release. Though Kodak retained the convention of using \"B” on shutters to denote the setting that provides momentary actuation, they referred to it as \"Brief Time\" in brochures for cameras like their \"Folding Autographic Brownies\", as well as in instruction manuals for products like their \"1 & 1A Pocket \"Kodaks\" Juniors\". \"Brief time\" was also used in reference works like \"Newnes Photographers' Pocket Reference Book\" (1955).\n\nThe bulb setting is used on some cameras, including some point-and-shoot cameras, to obtain shutter speeds slower than the minimum offered by the camera otherwise.\n\nBecause of the risk of camera movement, the camera is most often mounted on a tripod for the duration of the exposure. While it is generally possible to use the shutter release button on the camera itself, a cable release or electronic remote is often used to further eliminate the risk of shaking the camera during long exposures. The cable releases generally include a locking feature to eliminate the need to keep the button or plunger depressed during extremely long exposures.\n\nThe bulb setting is useful for the following types of photographic subjects:\n\n\nOn some modern cameras, bulb is a mode available as an option on the LCD menu only, if possible at all. On others, including many Digital SLR cameras, bulb is typically available from the manual exposure mode and—rarely—also from shutter priority mode. \n\nWhen set to bulb, generally on the \"M\" or manual setting of the camera, the shutter will stay open as long as the shutter release button (or shutter release cable or remote) remains depressed.\n\nSome mid-level or bridge cameras such as the Olympus SP-560UZ have a 'limited' bulb setting, allowing time exposures up to 8 minutes and at an ISO setting of 200 ISO and lower.\n\nIn 2012, Olympus introduced a new form of bulb mode with their \"Live Bulb\" (without toggle) and \"Live Time\" (with toggle) settings in their Olympus OM-D E-M5 digital camera, where the viewfinder and display gets updated \"during\" the exposure in order to allow the photographer to inspect the exposure while it \"develops\". The display refresh rate for this mode can be configured between 0.5 s and 60 s.\n\nSome specialized cameras use other image triggers.\n"}

{"id": "2175765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175765", "title": "Ramtha's School of Enlightenment", "text": "Ramtha's School of Enlightenment\n\nRamtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) is an American spiritual sect near the rural town of Yelm, Washington, U.S. The school was established in 1988 by J. Z. Knight, who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old being called Ramtha the Enlightened One. The school's teachings are based on these channeling sessions.\n\nIn 1988, J. Z. Knight founded Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE), then called Ramtha's School of Enlightenment: The American Gnostic School, on her estate in Yelm, Washington. A division of Knight's company JZK, Inc., the school had around 80 staff members . According to RSE's website, it is an \"academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of all ages and cultures\". RSE's private, fenced compounds are only open to staff members and students, not to the public.\n\nIn 2004, various Ramtha school leaders joined community groups to strongly oppose a proposed 75,000-seat NASCAR racetrack in Yelm. The proposal was withdrawn. In 2007, Knight's profits from the school's activities and from sale of books, tapes, CDs and DVDs had reportedly been around $2.6 million. In 2008, lessons were given to the public in more than 20 countries, including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile for the first time.\n\nThe school teaches that human beings have the capacity to utilize their inner wisdom, focus their brains, and create their own reality. The school's curriculum is based on the channelings by Knight of the entity Ramtha. Although the school has been criticised for being a cult (see below), Knight and her followers deny such claims and say that the school is neither a religion nor a cult.\n\nRamtha's School of Enlightenment teachings have been described as part of the New Age movement (the school itself claims to be outside it). A controversial religious scholar, J. Gordon Melton, wrote a book countering this argument called \"Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom\".\n\nLessons in the school's compounds sometimes include wine drinking, tobacco pipe smoking and dancing to rock ’n’ roll music. Allegedly, it is being taught that the nitric oxide in red wine (not the alcohol), also found in pipe tobacco (not the nicotine), can help to facilitate changes in the brain as a part of the process in which to achieve these means.\n\nThrough various focus techniques, the students believe they are on their way to becoming as \"enlightened\" as other shamans who can alter their personal reality at will. The main activities towards that goal vary from specific focusing, meditation-like techniques, breathing techniques, blindfolded archery, energy healing (for one's self and for someone else), finding the heart of a maze, and many more. The students are taught that human beings can train themselves into such powers that will allow them to levitate, raise the dead, make gold appear in their hand and predict the future. Eventually this may lead to the \"ascension\" of the physical body into the \"light body\".\n\nOther skills allegedly obtained by attending the lessons include psychokinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, and other ESP skills, which have been criticized by various skeptics around the world.\n\nThe dialogues, and a lot of transcripts from Knight's Ramtha talks, have been compiled and published over the course of many years. Videotapes of various dialogue sessions have also been released. While some major themes in the school's teachings are covered in these publications, more in-depth and systematic presentation of its philosophies and teachings is only accessible by attending a retreat in person.\n\nIn February 1997, Knight hosted a conference of scholars who had been studying her, the students and the school for the previous year. During their research phase, they also observed Knight's Ramtha sessions and measured various physiological functions of her body. The researchers examined Ramtha's teachings and the school's practices from a variety of perspectives, including physics, feminism, parapsychology and religion. Melton organized the research. In addition to the conference presenters, Knight invited the media to attend. However, Knight said she did not sponsor the conference to gain publicity or to convince her skeptics.\n\nKnight paid the travel expenses and stipends for the conference presenters, which caused some of Knight's critics to suggest she had influenced their research. The researchers denied this contention to the press and, according to the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", \"were offended by a suggestion that the New Age spiritualist could have tried to buy their support\".\n\nApart from the conference proceedings, two papers were published. In 1998, Stanley Krippner published a paper on the psychological, phenomenological and geomagnetic results of the various studies. In 2009, Joan Hageman published a paper examining the results of the physiological testing on Knight and six students.\n\nRamtha's School of Enlightenment has been called a cult by various people, including her former husband Jeff Knight, former personal bodyguard Glen Cunningham, former students of the school (such as David McCarthy or Joe Szimhart), and skeptic Michael Shermer. Melton's book, which denies the school's status as a cult, has been criticized for siding with the school and not providing a neutral description of what is going on within the school. He has also been called a \"cult apologist\" by various opposers of cults. His position was further criticized when he took the stand as a witness in the case of Knight v. Knight (1992–1995) against Jeff Knight (JZ Knight's husband at the time), by further supporting that the school is not a cult.\n\nFormer students of the school have accused the RSE of practicing brain-washing and mind-control, as well as using intimidation and fear techniques to keep students in the school. David McCarthy, a student of the RSE between 1989 and 1996, calls Knight a \"spiritual predator\", and he mentions various parts of the teachings which had an intimidative character, such as the prophecy that unless students remain faithful to Ramtha, they will become prey of the \"lizard people\", and that the ancient figure of Jehovah would return to earth accompanied by lizard people, in a spaceship. The former students (including David McCarthy and Joe Szimhart) have formed an online community, Life After RSE (LARSE), to provide support for people who have quit the school and find themselves lost.\n\nA further controversial issue regarding the Ramtha teachings involve the so-called \"days to come\", which were prophesied earth changes. Instructions reputed as coming from Ramtha were given to the students, telling them to leave the cities, find a place in the country to grow their own food and become sovereign or self-sufficient. Another instruction was told to students to build underground shelters to protect themselves and their families.\n\nVarious incidents within the school's grounds have been characterized as controversial. Glen Cunningham, in an interview with David McCarthy, describes how, one evening, Knight suggested that all students should stay there overnight because she said it would be \"good for the energy\". That was before the Great Arena (formerly used as horse stables) had been floored, and as a result there would be a lot of dust in the air. Cunningham says that there was a very old woman among the students, who begged him that she did not want to do this and she wanted to go home, but Ramtha said that she could stay under the protection of Ramtha and her bodyguard. Leaving the arena the following day, the old woman died of pneumonia (due to the dust in the air and humidity).\n\nAnother incident which is mentioned by both Cunningham and Joe Szimhart is the practice of running blindfolded in a large fenced field. Szimhart mentions in particular an occasion around the year 1990, in which about 1,000 blindfolded students were directed to split up and run across the field, with their hands in the \"Consciousness & Energy\" position in front of them, and the exercise was meant to help the students overcome their fears. Szimhart recalls how many people crashed into each other, and that there were some injuries. A customer of his ended up with a deeply bruised shoulder and a big lump on his forehead. Aside from the minor injuries, a few people had to be treated at the hospital.\n\nIn 2011, Knight stated (while at the RSE supposedly channeling Ramtha), \"Fuck God’s chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now\", and said that Mexican people \"breed like rabbits\" and are \"poison,\" that all gay men used to be Catholic priests, and that organic farmers have bad hygiene. In 2012, videos of this were placed on the Internet by ex-students of Knight's and by the Freedom Foundation.\n\nIn 2004, three members of the RSE produced a controversial film that combined documentary interviews and a fictional narrative to posit a connection between science and spirituality, called \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\". The film has been criticized by the scientific community due to its mis-representation of quantum physics, and an unnecessary connection to consciousness. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a \"pseudoscientific docudrama\", saying \"Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought.\"\n\n\n"}

The company was founded by Theodore Krainin, who emigrated from the Russian Empire in the 1880s. By 1921, the factory was registered as government inspected establishment #552 by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry with Theodore Krainin as proprietor. Alfred W. McCann writing in a 1921 \"Globe and Commercial Advertiser\" article cited Hebrew National as having \"higher standards than the law requires.\" McCann wrote the article during a crusade for commercial food decency standards, in which the \"Globe\" was prominent. He wrote, \"More power to Krainin and the decency he represents! Such evidence of the kind of citizenship which America should covet is not to be passed by lightly.\" Hebrew National \"served the Jewish neighborhoods of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Germany and soon developed a favorable reputation among the other Jewish residents of New York City.\"\nIn 1934, after a bankruptcy action, the certificate of incorporation for Hebrew National Sausage Factory listed Solomon Levinson, Sylvia Marans and Miriam Spector, all of Brooklyn, as directors and shareholders. In 1937 after an increase in capital stock, Jacob Pinkowitz was listed as an officer. The company was bought by Jewish Romanian immigrant butcher Isadore Pines (born \"Pinkowitz\"). In 1935, Isadore's son, Leonard Pines, took over the business. In 1965, Hebrew National came up with the slogan that they've used ever since: \"We answer to a higher authority\" — a reference to Jewish dietary laws and a claim to higher quality that was able to appeal to both Jewish and non-Jewish markets. In 1968, the Pines family sold Hebrew National to Riviana Foods, which was taken over by Colgate-Palmolive in 1976. In 1980, Isidore \"\"Skip\"\" Pines, grandson of Isidore, bought the company from Colgate-Palmolive for a fraction of the price it was originally sold for.\n\nThe health food movement of the 1980s, with CEO Steve Silk at the helm, encouraged the company to stick to a recipe that used no artificial colors or flavors, and to minimize other potential modernizations of the recipe. This strategy ultimately proved successful, and with a growing revenue, Hebrew National hoped to transform itself into a large conglomerate through acquiring other brands, in order to compete with the food giants that dominated the industry.\n\nHebrew National developed a non-kosher brand called \"National Deli\". This strategy was less successful, and National Foods was acquired by ConAgra Foods in 1993. The National Deli brand was sold off in 2001 to a former Hebrew National employee, and still operates out of Miami, Florida.\n\nThe site of Hebrew National's manufacturing plant had been New York City for many years; it moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1989. The Indianapolis plant was closed down in 2004 as operations were consolidated with the ConAgra Foods Armour hot dog plant in Quincy, Michigan.\n\nThe majority of Hebrew National beef products are consumed by non-Jews. The \"Jewish Daily Forward\" wrote in 2004, that then-recent changes in supervision are \"unlikely to translate into a significant increase in sales.\" Despite Hebrew National being described as \"the largest, most recognized kosher brand in the United States\" as of \"the middle of the twentieth century,\" the company's level of being kosher \"did not seem to impress yeshiva-educated elements of the Orthodox Jewish community.\"\n\nFor many years, Hebrew National relied on a body within the company to certify its products kosher. Many Orthodox Jews did not feel that Hebrew National's kosher standards were up to those set in place by groups such as the Orthodox Union, Kof-K, and others, and therefore did not consume Hebrew National beef-based products. Standards and opinions differed for Hebrew National's poultry.\n\nThe Conservative movement also did not regard Hebrew National as kosher. Rabbi Paul Plotkin, the chair of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards' Kashrut Committee, wrote that \"Until recently, Hebrew National, which is widely distributed, wasn't 'kosher enough.' Its supervision was unacceptable to many Jews who keep kosher including the Conservative movement.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, Hebrew National switched to an external certification group, Triangle K, under the auspices of Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, which was widely seen as an upgrade in its standards of kashrut. In 2004, the Conservative movement found the upgrade sufficient to be acceptable. Rabbis Ralbag and Plotkin conferred jointly and developed a strategy for consistent monitoring of the products labeled kosher by Hebrew National. By reducing production facilities to just one location, expenses were dramatically reduced for upkeep, utilities, employees, and maintenance. The production process was streamlined so that a viewing station kept an eye on each individual sausage that passed through the facility. Rabbis Plotkin and Ralbag share monitoring duties amongst a group of other rabbis, allowing for a reliable dedication to the purveyance of kosher hot dogs. Hebrew National hot dogs are, in this way, able to claim their product as kosher. In a blog post on the subject, Conservative rabbi and kosher certification entrepreneur Jason Miller lamented the fact that in several baseball stadiums in the United States, Hebrew National hot dogs are publicized as kosher \"when in fact they are cooked on the same grill as the non-kosher hot dogs and sausages\" and served on dairy hot dog buns.\n\nNonetheless, \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" reported that most Orthodox authorities did not follow this endorsement, and most Orthodox Jews continue not to rely on its kashrut.\n\nHebrew National makes beef products including beef franks, salami, bologna, corned beef, pastrami, and knackwurst. Condiment sales were discontinued in 2010.\n\n"}

He was picked up from the Norwegian 1st division team Moss F.K. for somewhat less than 500,000 NOK (approx. €63,000 or $75,000 USD). As an almost complete midfielder, he is very aggressive, has good technique, a fine passing foot, heavy shot and an amazing running capacity. He has delivered the best stamina test result in the history of Tromsø, surpassing even former Tromsø player Morten Gamst Pedersen. After performing an amazing autumn season and a fine spring for Tromsø, they refused an offer of 10 million NOK (approx. €1.3 million) for him from the Turkish club Beşiktaş.\n\nBernier started the 2007 season as one of the Tippeliga's best players, scoring two fantastic goals against Norway's best soccer club the last 20 years, Rosenborg BK. Although Rosenborg went on to win the game with an injury time goal by Alexander Tettey, Bernier was awarded the \"Man of the Match\"-prize. Tromsø immediately offered Bernier a new contract. However, he rejected as he wanted to leave Norway for a better league. Tromsø then put forth an even better deal, but Bernier was determined to leave Tippeligaen.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, Bernier left Tromsø for the German 2. Bundesliga club 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where former Vålerenga I.F. Fotball Kjetil Rekdal was the trainer.\n\nOn June 25, 2008, he signed a contract with Danish club FC Nordsjælland. On August 14, 2008, he scored the winning goal in the first leg of a UEFA Cup second qualifying round match versus Scottish club, Queen of the South of Dumfries. Bernier scored the winning goal and his first goal of the 2010 season on November 14 in a 2–1 home win over Lyngby. He ended his season early in May against Copenhagen, following an early substitution it was revealed that he suffered a fracture in his fibula. He played over 90 games in all competitions combined with FC Nordsjaelland, from the summer of 2008 until the summer of 2011, winning the Danish Cup in 2010 and 2011. He was voted Player of the Year in 2010 by the supporters of FC Nordsjaelland.\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Bernier signed a one-year contract with Lyngby Boldklub. He made his debut against his former club, in a 4–0 loss to FCN. On October 16, Bernier scored his first goal for the club in a 3–2 loss to Silkeborg IF.\n\nOn December 19, 2011, Bernier signed a contract to join Montreal Impact upon their entry at Major League Soccer in 2012. He remained under contract with Lyngby Boldklub while they finished their season. However, he had an out clause that allowed him to leave without a transfer fee to the Impact. Bernier scored his first goal for Montreal in a 2–0 away victory against Sporting Kansas City on May 5, 2012. He was named MLS Player of the Week for Week 13-15 in the 2012 MLS. He was also named MLS Player of the Month for the month of August 2012.\nUnder his captaincy, the Impact reached the CONCACAF Champions League final in 2015 and the MLS Eastern Conference final losing to Toronto FC in 2016. At age 38, he played the final match of his career on October 22, 2017 against the New England Revolution.\n\nBernier played at the 1995 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Ecuador, alongside Brad Parker. They are the only ones of that squad to make it to the senior team.\n\nHe made his senior debut for Canada in a November 2003 friendly match against the Czech Republic. By December 2009, he earned a total of 43 caps, scoring two goals. He reached 50 caps in a friendly against Jamaica on September 9, 2014.\n\nAfter a two-year absence, Bernier returned to the national team under Octavio Zambrano for a friendly against Curaçao on June 13, 2017. The next month he captained Canada at the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, retiring from the national team after Canada's elimination in the quarter-finals to Jamaica.\n\nBernier was born in Brossard, Quebec, to Haitian parents.\n\nBernier played two seasons of junior ice hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He spent parts of those seasons with Val-d'Or Foreurs where he would be teammates with future National Hockey League players Steve Bégin and Roberto Luongo, and the Sherbrooke Faucons. In 143 games, he amassed 17 goals and 73 points.\n\nIn 2018, a few weeks after his retirement, it was announced that Bernier was named as a U13, U15, U17 and U19 assistant coach at the Montreal Impact Academy. \n\nHe played two seasons in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League as a defender. In his first season in 1996-97. Val-d'Or players take part in the QMJHL playoffs and pass the second round before being eliminated in the division final by the Hull Olympics, future winners of the playoffs. He begins the following season with Val-d'Or, but after about forty meetings, joins the Sherbrook Castors who did not qualify for the playoffs. He decided to stop his hockey career following discussions with an agent telling him that his profile was not wanted by the National Hockey League teams.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in 2005 in conjunction with the Martin Scorsese PBS television documentary on Dylan \"No Direction Home\", and was compiled with Scorsese's input. It features mostly previously unreleased material from Dylan's formative years to his rise as an international figure, spanning 1959 to his legendary 1966 world tour.\n\n\"The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack\" fared well commercially, debuting on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart on September 17, 2005 at number 16, with sales of 50,987 copies. It remained on the chart for 11 weeks. It was certified a gold record on October 21, 2005 by the RIAA. It also reached number 21 in the UK.\n\nThe project eventually titled as \"No Direction Home\" began to take form in 1995 when Dylan's manager, Jeff Rosen, began scheduling interviews with Dylan's friends and associates. Among those interviewed were poet Allen Ginsberg and folk musician Dave Van Ronk, both of whom died before the film was ever completed. Dylan's old girlfriend Suze Rotolo also granted a rare interview, and she later told \"Rolling Stone\" that she was very pleased with the project's results. Dylan himself also sat for ten hours in a relaxed and open conversation with Rosen in 2000.\n\nAccording to \"Rolling Stone\", an unnamed source close to the project claimed that Dylan himself had no involvement with the project apart from the interview, saying that \"[Dylan] has no interest in this … Bob truly does not look back.\" However, work on the first installment of Dylan's autobiography, \"Chronicles, Vol. 1\", did overlap production of the project, though it is unclear how much, if any, influence \"Chronicles\" may have had on \"No Direction Home\".\n\nThough raw material was being gathered for the project, Rosen needed someone to edit and shape it into a quality picture, and celebrated filmmaker Martin Scorsese was approached to \"direct\" the documentary planned from the project. Scorsese eventually agreed and came aboard in 2001.\n\nIn the meantime, Dylan's office gathered hundreds of hours of historical film footage dating from the time covered in \"No Direction Home\". These included a scratchy recording of Dylan's high school rock band, his 1965 screen test for Andy Warhol, and newly discovered footage of the famous Manchester, England concert from , when an angry fan called out \"Judas!\" just before Dylan and the Hawks performed \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Shot by D. A. Pennebaker, the onstage, color footage was found in 2004 in a pile of water-damaged film recovered from Dylan's vaults.\n\nAt the same time, musical recordings from Dylan's archives were also being explored for an accompanying soundtrack. As originally planned, the soundtrack included live performances featured in the film, such as Dylan's first live electric performance—\"Maggie's Farm\", backed by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band—at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Producer Steve Berkowitz helped create the first multitrack mix of this performance which was ultimately used for the soundtrack, saying \"it's raw, it's punk rock...There was nothing overdubbed, nothing changed. Everything in the soundtrack was mixed and mastered to sound like it sounded then.\" Many performances could not be remixed, including a 1966 performance of \"Ballad of a Thin Man\" which was taken from a mono recording, the only one ever made. \"It's totally distorto, but I love it,\" says Berkowitz. \"Talk about verite—it's [absolutely] perfect.\" Despite the praise, the recording appears in \"fake\" stereo on the compilation.\n\nHowever, as the soundtrack was compiled, it was eventually decided to include material that was not featured in the documentary, including many previously unreleased studio outtakes.\n\nAll songs written by Bob Dylan, except where noted\n\n\n\nThree outtakes were released as an internet single for download entitled \"Exclusive Outtakes from \"No Direction Home\"\".\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1888, in Sebastopol, California, as the \"Hunt Bros. Fruit Packing Co.\" by Joseph and William Hunt. The brothers relocated to nearby Santa Rosa in 1890, and then to Hayward in 1895. This small canning operation grew rapidly, focused on canning the products of California's booming fruit and vegetable industries. By 1941, the plant shipped a hundred million cans of soup, fruits, vegetables, and juices annually.\n\nIn 1943, Hunt's was taken over by Norton Simon's Val Vita Food Products - a competing firm founded in the early 1930s and based in Fullerton, California. The merged firm kept the \"Hunt's\" name and incorporated as Hunt Food and Industries, Inc. The new management decided to focus the company on canned tomato products, particularly prepared tomato sauce.\n\nThe Wesson Oil & Snowdrift Company merged with Hunt's Foods, Inc. in 1960 to become Hunt-Wesson Foods. Hunt-Wesson merged with the McCall Corporation and Canada Dry to form Norton Simon Inc. in 1968. Norton Simon was acquired by Esmark in 1983, which merged with Beatrice Foods the next year. In 1985, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired Beatrice with the goal of selling off businesses.

Krishna Dasa was born in 1496 CE in a family of Baidya physicians in the village of Jhamatpur, within the district of Bardhaman, West Bengal. His father was called Bhagiratha, and his mother was named Sunanda. He also had a younger brother named Shyamananda Dasa. Both his parents died when he was young, thus he and his brother were raised by relatives.\n\nKrishna Dasa relates in his Chaitanya Charitamrita that, once his brother argued with a prominent Vaishnava devotee Minaketana Ramadasa over the ontological positions of Chaitanya and Nityananda (Chaitanya’s lifelong companion) and belittled the position of Nityananda. Krishna Dasa considered this to be an unpardonable offence and rejected his brother forthwith.\n\nAfter receiving instructions in a vision from Nityananda, Krishna Dasa left Bengal and travelled to Vrindavana where he took initiation from Raghunatha Dasa Goswami (1494–1586 CE), one of the direct followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\n\nAt an advanced age and in poor health Krishna Dasa commenced work on his magnum-opus the Chaitanya Charitamrita (c. 1557) after being repeatedly petitioned by the devotees in Vrindavana who had never met Chaitanya and who were eager for details. He vividly describes in the text itself: “I have now become too old and disturbed by invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. I cannot remember anything, nor can I see or hear properly. Still I write, and this is a great wonder.”\n\nIn composing his Charitamrita, Krishna Dasa used the diaries of Murari Gupta and Swarupa Damodara, both of whom were intimate associates of Chaitanya. Krishna Dasa was given a great deal of information by his guru, Raghunatha Dasa also, who had served Swarupa Damodara when the latter was Chaitanya's personal secretary.\n\nDue to its amount of detail on the life of Chaitanya and his precepts, the Chaitanya-charitamrita became the definitive biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nAccording to the Gaura-ganoddesha-dipika of Kavi Karnapura, Krishna Dasa Kaviraja has been identified as being an incarnation of the handmaiden of Krishna called Kasturi Manjari.\n\nKrishna Dasa Kaviraja wrote some short prayers in Sanskrit as well as two other major works in addition to the Chaitanya Charitamrita:\n\nThe most definitive biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\n\nGovinda-lilamrita is a work explaining the daily pastimes of Krishna and his associates in Vrindavana.\n\nThis is a commentary on the Krishna-karnamrita of Bilvamangala Thakura.\n\n"}

United States, 238 F.2d 266 (D.C. Cir. 1956) was a seminal ruling in United States telecommunications decided by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Hush-A-Phone Corporation marketed a small, cup-like device which mounted on the speaking party's microphone, reducing the risk of conversations being overheard and increasing sound fidelity for the listening party. At the time, AT&T had a near-monopoly on America's phone system, even controlling the equipment attached to its network. In this era, Americans had to lease equipment from Ma Bell or use approved devices. Hush-A-Phone had been around for 20 years without any issues. However, when an AT&T lawyer saw one in a store window, the company decided to sue on the grounds anything attached to a phone could damage its network.\n\nAT&T, citing the Communications Act of 1934, which stated in part that the company had the right to make changes and dictate \"the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges,\" claimed the right to \"forbid attachment to the telephone of any device 'not furnished by the telephone company.'\"\n\nInitially, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled in AT&T's favor. It found that the device was a \"foreign attachment\" subject to AT&T control and that unrestricted use of the device could, in the commission's opinion, result in a general deterioration of the quality of telephone service.\n\nA federal appeals court dismissed AT&T's claim. The court's decision stated that AT&T's prohibition of the device was not \"just, fair, and reasonable,\" as required under the Communications Act of 1934. Per the judgment, the device \"does not physically impair any of the facilities of the telephone companies,\" nor did it \"affect more than the conversation of the user.\" The court thus exonerated Hush-A-Phone and prohibited further interference by AT&T toward Hush-A-Phone users.\n\nAfter the ruling, it was still illegal to connect some equipment to the AT&T network. For example, modems could not electronically connect to the phone system. Instead, Americans had to connect their modems mechanically by attaching a phone receiver to an acoustic coupler via suction cups.\n\nRegardless, the victory for Hush-A-Phone was widely considered a watershed moment in the development of a secondary market for terminal equipment and the breakup of the Bell System. This landmark decision, and the related Carterfone decision, were seen as precursors to the entry of MCI Communications, the development of more pervasive telecom competition, and the creation of FCC regulations to let users more freely use America's phone network. These changes were perhaps best seen in 1981 when the Hayes Smartmodem electronically connected home computers to the internet for the first time.\n\n\n"}

The oversides of the wings are a uniform dull brown, with two paler patches on the male's forewings made up of scent scales. The undersides are a bright green with a thin white line, often reduced to a faint row of dots or even missing altogether. The iridescent green colour of the undersides is a structural colour caused by diffraction and interference of light by microscopic repeating structures forming a diffraction grating in the wing scales. The caterpillars are green with yellow markings along the back. Like other members of the family they are rather sluglike.\n\nThese butterflies can be found at the end of March, with flight time usually lasting until the end of June, but they are sometimes seen in July and early August. They never rest with their wings open, to maintain their green camouflage. The males exhibit territorial behavior.\n\nThe eggs are laid singly. The caterpillars are not known to be tended by ants, unlike some lycid larvae, but the pupae, which are formed at ground level, emit squeaks that attract ants and it is thought that ants will always bury any that are found. Green hairstreaks overwinter as pupae and are univoltine, having one generation of adult butterflies per year.\n\nThe larva is recorded as feeding on \"Vaccinium myrtillus\", \"Vaccinum uliginosum\", \"Betula\", \"Rubus idaeus\", \"Vicia cracca\", \"Trifolium medium\", \"Calluna vulgaris\", \"Frangula\", \"Rhamnus\", \"Ribes\", \"Spiraea\", \"Caragana\", \"Chamaecytisus\", \"Hedysarum\", \"Genista\", \"Trifolium\" and \"Hippophae rhamnoides\" in different parts of its range.\n\nThis polyphagous species probably has one of the largest range of food plants of any British butterfly. Early butterfly collectors thought that the only food plant was bramble (blackberry) \"Rubus fruticosus\" but as its habits became better understood the list grew and will probably continue to do so. Depending on the habitat it will use common rock rose \"Helianthemum nummularium\", bird's-foot trefoil \"Lotus corniculatus\", gorse \"Ulex europaeus\", broom \"Cytisus scoparius\", Dyer's greenweed \"Genista tinctoria\", bilberry \"Vaccinium myrtillus\", dogwood \"Cornus sanguinea\", buckthorn \"Rhamnus cathartica\", cross-leaved heath \"Erica tetralix\" and bramble.\n\nThe wide range of food plants means that this butterfly is able to use a wide range of habitats including chalk downland, heathland, moorland and clearings in woodland. It is present in wetlands as well as on poor dry meadows, at an elevation of about .\n\n\"Callophrys rubi\" is found in most of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia Minor, Siberia, Amurland, Baluchistan and Chitral. It is still widespread across most of the UK, although many colonies have been lost in recent years. In Mediterranean countries it is quite localised and it is usually found near the coasts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2175802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175802", "title": "Vector Motors", "text": "Vector Motors\n\nVector Motors Corporation is an American automobile manufacturer originally based in Wilmington, California. Its history can be traced to Vehicle Design Force, which was founded in 1978 by Gerald Wiegert. Vehicle production by Vector Aeromotive began in 1989 and ceased in 1993. The company was later revived as Vector Motors Corporation, and has continued to develop sports cars. When founded, Vector represented America's first attempt to compete with European performance car manufacturers like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Lotus. Altogether around 50 Vector sports car models were developed and produced during the 1980s and 1990s including some racing versions mostly built using American made components.\n\nNearly every car produced by the company is designated the letter \"W\" (for Wiegert) and a number. A letter \"X\" after the W (e.g. WX-8) signifies a prototype unit.\n\nAs of August 2018, the company is still actively developing an entirely new vehicle, the WX-8, a vehicle positioned in the colloquially named \"hypercar\" category, which it first announced and presented a prototype model of back in 2007.\n\nIn 1971, Gerald Wiegert, who had just graduated from college, founded a design house called \"Vehicle Design Force\" and teamed up with Lee Brown, a well-known auto body expert in Hollywood, to create a new car called The Vector. The Vector was planned to feature various powerplant options, including a DOHC Porsche engine, and preproduction literature said that it would cost US$10,000 (at the time, a new Rolls Royce Silver Shadow cost $11,500). The Vector was featured on the cover of \"Motor Trend\" magazine in April 1972, and a concept prototype was displayed at the 1976 LA Auto Show, however the car did not enter production. Lee Brown left the design team in 1977. Wiegert renamed Vehicle Design Force to \"Vector Aeromotive\" after the previous vehicle's research was refocused on a new car, the Vector W2.\n\nThe W2 concept appeared in 1978. Like the first car, it was immobile at the time of its show debut, but in 1979, a running prototype was constructed. The vehicle traveled over , the most of any concept vehicle.\n\nThe W2 was extensively covered by many magazines, and it was thoroughly tested by Motor Trend magazine and the British automotive television program \"Top Gear\". However, \"Top Gear\" was ordered not to perform a top speed test on it, even though Vector claimed the car was capable of 230 mph.\n\nIn 1989, Wiegert's company, now known as the Vector Aeromotive Corporation, began production of the W8, an evolution of the W2. Financial backing came from public stock offerings and various lawsuits including suits against the Goodyear Tire Company (trademark infringement with the Vector brand of tires) and Vantage cigarettes. Two W8 prototypes were made, of which only one ran. The Vector W8 utilized an automatic Oldsmobile TM425 Transaxle mated to a Twin-Turbo CAN-AM modified Chevrolet small block V8 engine.\n\nOne black W8 was pre-ordered by famous tennis player Andre Agassi. Since Vectors were hand built, each required significant time to finish, calibrate and test, but Agassi demanded that the company deliver his W8 before it was ready. Vector complied, and company representatives told him that he could display it, but warned him not to drive it until the final work was completed. Agassi ignored this advice, and when the vehicle broke down, Wiegert and Vector Aeromotive refunded his US$455,000 purchase price; this resulted in negative publicity despite the circumstances. Afterwards, Agassi's W8 was finished and the car was resold. A total of 17 Vector W8 cars were built for public sale. The Vector W8 appeared in the 1993 film \"Rising Sun\", driven by a Japanese businessman.\n\nWiegert displayed Vector motorcar at the Geneva Auto Show in 1993. The Avtech WX-3 coupe and Avtech WX-3R roadster further evolved the W8 design. Only one prototype of each model was built. Plans called for the WX-3 to carry three different engine options: a \"basic\" V-8, an \"tuned\" option, and a twin turbo option, While the Coupe had the twin turbo engine (tuned to about 800 hp) the roadster had the same Chevrolet engine as the W8. When the WX-3 debuted in 1993, MegaTech, an Indonesian company, acquired a controlling interest in Vector. After Wiegert returned from the Geneva show, the Vector board asked Wiegert to relinquish control of the company and assume only the role of the company's designer. He refused, and ordered the Vector headquarters physically locked down. He was later fired from Vector Aeromotive. The WX-3 Coupe was originally painted silver, but it was repainted teal-blue by Wiegert to match the teal-blue and purple logo of his Aquajet jet-ski company. The teal-blue coupe and purple roadster are featured as promotional vehicles on the Aquajet website.\n\nMegatech moved Vector from its Wiegert-owned headquarters building in Wilmington, California, to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where the company could share office space with fellow MegaTech-owned automaker Automobili Lamborghini.\n\nThe new Vector Aeromotive Corporation created a car called the Vector M12, which was loosely based on the WX-3 but powered by a version of the Lamborghini Diablo V12 engine. Consequently, some work on the M12 was handled by Lamborghini. As such, many of the essentially American \"spirit\" characteristics of previous editions did not carry over to the M12.\n\nProduction of the M12 began in 1995 in Florida, and the car was introduced at the 1996 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where Vector displayed two examples. Production was shuttered late in 1996 when the $189,000 cars did not meet projected sales targets. Production resumed after MegaTech sold off Lamborghini (to Audi) and Vector (to management). By early 1999, only 14 M12s were produced. Lamborghini did not fulfill its contracted delivery of motors due primarily to Vector's inability to pay for them. It was alleged that Tommy Suharto, son of Indonesian strongman General Suharto and a MegaTech principal, illegally embezzled from the company for his own personal gain.\n\nAccording to one story, Lamborghini took a W8 for payment for the engines, but since the W8 in question was still Wiegert's property at the time, he took the case to court. He won it back, although Lamborghini, now owned by Volkswagen, has since refused to give the car back.\n\nVector reduced the cost of the M12 and created the SRV8. This new model went back to its American roots, featuring a modified version of the GM LT1 engine found in the Corvette and a Porsche G50 transaxle. Although, within days of the car's first public appearance, Vector shut its doors. Only one prototype was produced.\n\nAfter the remains of Vector Aeromotive were sold to American Aeromotive, Wiegert took back the assets of Vector and changed the company name from \"Avtech Motors\" to \"Vector Supercars\", then finally to \"Vector Motors\".\n\nSince the company's closure, rumors began to circulate about Wiegert developing a new car to bring Vector back to life with a new model called the WX8. At the Concorso Italiano on August 18, 2006, Wiegert showed up in the V-8 Avtech prototype with friend Keith Rosenberg. He confirmed that he had begun work on another car.\n\nWiegert had the Avtech on display at the Rodeo Drive Concours d'Elegance on June 17, 2007. His business card for Vector Motors Corporation (Wilmington, CA) has him titled as \"Chairman and CEO.\" He also announced plans to debut his new prototype at the 2008 LA Auto Show.\n\nAt the LA Auto Show, Wiegert presented a prototype of the WX8. The car is powered by a supercharged 10-litre all-aluminum V8 with a projected output of , which would make it more powerful than the Bugatti Veyron and the SSC Ultimate Aero TT. Vector claims that the WX8 has a top speed of and a 0-60 time of just under three seconds.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175805", "title": "Famine Stela", "text": "Famine Stela\n\nThe Famine Stela is an inscription written in Egyptian hieroglyphs located on Sehel Island in the Nile near Aswan in Egypt, which tells of a seven-year period of drought and famine during the reign of pharaoh Djoser of the Third Dynasty. It is thought that the stele was inscribed during the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which ruled from 332 to 31 BC.\n\nThe Famine Stela was inscribed into a natural granite block whose surface was cut into the rectangular shape of a stela. The inscription is written in hieroglyphs and contains 42 columns. The top part of the stele depicts three Egyptian deities: Khnum, Satis and Anuket. In front of them, Djoser faces them, carrying offerings in his outstretched hands. A broad fissure, which already was there at the time of creating the stela, goes through the middle of the rock. Some sections of the stela are damaged making a few passages of the text unreadable.\n\nThe story told on the stela is set in the 18th year of the reign of Djoser. The text describes how the king is upset and worried as the land has been in the grip of a drought and famine for seven years, during which time the Nile has not flooded the farmlands. The text also describes how the Egyptians are suffering as a result of the drought and that they are desperate and breaking the laws of the land. Djoser asks the priest staff under the supervision of high lector priest Imhotep for help. The king wants to know where the god of the Nile, Hapi, is born, and which god resides at this place.\n\nImhotep decides to investigate the archives of the temple \"ḥwt-Ibety\" (“House of the nets”), located at Hermopolis and dedicated to the god Thoth. He informs the king that the flooding of the Nile is controlled by the god Khnum at Elephantine from a sacred spring located on the island, where the god resides. Imhotep travels immediately to the location (). In the temple of Khnum, called “Joy of Life”, Imhotep purifies himself, prays to Khnum for help and offers “all good things” to him. Suddenly he falls asleep and in his dream Imhotep is greeted by the kindly looking Khnum. The god introduces himself to Imhotep by describing who and what he is and then describes his own divine powers. At the end of the dream Khnum promises to make the Nile flow again. Imhotep wakes up and writes down everything that took place in his dream. He then returns to Djoser to tell the king what has happened.\n\nThe king is pleased with the news and issues a decree in which he orders priests, scribes and workers to restore Khnum´s temple and to once more make regular offerings to the god. In addition, Djoser issues a decree in which he grants the temple of Khnum at Elephantine the region between Aswan and Tachompso () with all its wealth, as well as a share of all the imports from Nubia.\n\nSince the initial translation and examination by French Egyptologist Paul Barguet in 1953, the Famine Stela has been of great interest to historians and Egyptologists. The language and layout used in the inscription suggests that the work can be dated to the Ptolemaic period, perhaps during the reign of king Ptolemy V (205 – 180 BC). Egyptologists such as Miriam Lichtheim and Werner Vycichl suggest that the local priests of Khnum created the text. The various religious groups in Egypt during Ptolemaic Dynasty jostled for power and influence, so the story of the Famine Stela could have been used as a means to legitimise the power of Khnum's priests over the region of Elephantine.\n\nAt the time of the first translation of the stela, it was thought that the story of a seven-year-famine was connected to the biblical story in \"Genesis 41\", where a famine of seven years also occurs. More recent investigations have shown that a seven-year famine was a motif common to nearly all cultures of the Near East: a Mesopotamian legend also speaks of a seven-year-famine and in the well known Gilgamesh-Epos the god Anu gives a prophecy about a famine for seven years. Another Egyptian tale about a long-lasting drought appears in the so-called “Book of the Temple”, translated by German Demotist Joachim Friedrich Quack. The ancient text reports about king Neferkasokar (late 2nd dynasty), who faces a seven-year-famine during his reign.\n\nThe Famine Stela is one of only three known inscriptions that connect the cartouche name \"Djeser\" (“lordly”) with the serekh name \"Netjerikhet\" (“divine body”) of king Djoser in one word. Therefore, it provides useful evidence for Egyptologists and historians who are involved in reconstructing the royal chronology of the Old Kingdom of Egypt.\n\n"}

It is one of the sixteen Districts of Sierra Leone. Bo District is the fourth most populous District in Sierra Leone. Its capital and largest city is the city of Bo, which is the third most populous city in Sierra Leone. other major towns in the district include Baoma, Bumpeh, Serabu, Sumbuya, Baiima and Yele. \n\nBo District borders Kenema District to the east, Tonkolili District to the north, Moyamba District to the west, Bonthe District to the southwest and Pujehun District to the south. The district population as of 2015 is 574,201. Bo District occupies a total area of 5,219 km² and is subdivided into fifteen chiefdoms.\n\nThe population of Bo District is mainly from the Mande ethnic group, though the city of Bo has a very ethnic diverse population.\n\nBo District has its own directly elected local government called District Council and is where executive and lesgislative authority is vested at local level within Bo District. The Bo District Council is Headed by a council chairman, who is an elected official and is responsible for the general management of the district. The current council Chairman of Bo District is Joseph Munda Bindi of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), following his election victory in the 2018 Sierra Leone local election.\n\nThe city of Bo also has its own directly elected city council headed by a mayor. The current mayor of Bo is Harold Logie Tucker, he is a member of the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). Bo District is a stronghold of the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party.\n\nBo District currently has twelve Representatives in the Parliament of Sierra Leone, of which eleven members were elected for a 5-year term in the 2007 general elections. The district is a stronghold of the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). The following is a list of Representatives and affiliations:\n\nThe population of Bo District is ethnically and culturally diverse, particularly in the city of Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city. The Mende people form the largest ethnic group in Bo District at over 60 percent of the population.\n\nWith Bo being the second largest city in Sierra Leone, trading, gold and diamond mining are major economic activities for the district; as well as agricultural production of rice growing, and coffee, cacao and oil palm.\n\nBo District is home to 385 Primary Schools and 40 Secondary Schools. Bo Government Secondary School, commonly called Bo School is among the 40 secondary schools in Bo District. The school was founded in 1906 by Leslie Probyn to educate the children of Bo District. The school has a long history of developing the elite of Sierra Leone, especially the country's politicians.\n\nBo District suffered badly at the hands of rebel forces during 1994/1995, and many major towns were almost entirely destroyed (Tikonko and Bumpe, for example). However, since the ousting of the Junta in early 1998, Bo District has remained secure, due mainly to the strong presence of the Civil Defence Forces. As such, rather than suffering from displacement, Bo district has been the recipient of displaced persons from less secure parts of the country.\n\nAlthough aid agencies have had uninterrupted access to the district for five years because of its relative stability, most of the recovery efforts were concentrated in Bo Town leaving out the 8 sections in Kakua chiefdom as well as all the other 14 chiefdoms in the district.\n\nThe major recovery needs according to sectoral priorities are as follows: Road rehabilitation, Education, Water and Sanitation, Health, Agriculture, Restoration of Local Government Structures and Shelter.\n\nThe district is made up of fifteen chiefdoms as the third level of administrative subdivision.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Future Convergence Research Division aims to reinforce national competitiveness and contribute to KIST's positioning as the global leader of technological convergence research by interlinking biotechnology, nanotechnology and information technology.\n\n\nThe world is faced with many challenges including climate change and ensuring sustainable growth in the future. The National Agenda Research Division was established to contribute to the creation of forward-looking green industries in Korea. It is responsible for the development of renewable energy sources, carbon cycle, water cycle and original technology for robotics. Its eight research centers are designed to maximize the core strengths of different areas such as energy, the environment and systems with an eye to advancing the nation's economic progress through convergence research projects jointly led by its centers.\n\n\nKIST offers a variety of academic programs for students in Korea and from abroad.\n\nThe Korea University of Science and Technology (UST) is a graduate-level educational institution founded jointly by 22 government institutes in Korea, including KIST, in various fields of science and technology. The program fosters the development of S&T professionals by taking advantage of the extensive facilities, equipment, personnel, and projects at the member research institutes. Students at UST participate in research projects and industrial site operations to receive in-depth field and research-oriented education and training in their respective major disciplines.\n\nKIST founded the International R&D Academy (IRDA) in 2001 as a unique graduate program. This program is open exclusively to promising foreign scientists and engineers. Under the guidance of KIST's experienced scientists, the IRDA offers its students a multidisciplinary, hands-on approach to learning which, in turn, provides expanded opportunities to pursue individual research activities. This approach provides the IRDA student with a challenging and enriching educational experience. The goal of this program is to train and educate prospective foreign scientists and engineers to become leading researchers in academia and industry in their respective countries. Emphasis is specifically placed on transferring KIST's established knowledge and experience in R&D, focusing on innovative technologies and developing R&D management skills. Students admitted to IRDA are registered at UST, as KIST confer degrees through UST. Through this collaboration, students are able to benefit from a research-oriented program and cooperate with 22 national institutes.\n\nAs of 2010, about 100 students from over 20 countries including Israel, Russia, Ukraine, and several Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.) were directly involved in research projects at KIST, studying interdisciplinary fusion technologies, materials & devices, robotics & systems, energy, environment and life & health via KIST's mentoring system of training in cutting-edge technology and R&D knowledge. All IRDA students receive full scholarship benefits.\n\nThis collaborative scheme is a premier S&T educational program which is carried out in partnership with prominent universities in Korea. The program distinguishes itself from other conventional master's and doctoral programs by offering unique research-oriented experiences. Participating students are required to complete their basic coursework at the universities where they are enrolled. After beginning their studies, they may involve themselves simultaneously in research and their thesis/dissertation projects at KIST. KIST researchers, in conjunction with faculty at the students’ respective universities, act as co-advisors.\n\nKIST has implemented a Star-Postdoctoral Program for international professionals which is intended to attract new global talent in S&T through a year-round application process and a secure verification system. In addition, KIST runs a training program called Postdoctoral Fellow Program to attract young, creative Korean scientists by offering them an opportunity to earn valuable R&D experience and go into academia, R&D society, and industry. With these premier postdoctoral research-fellow recruiting programs, KIST is adding another element to its efforts to ensure a healthy pool of high-quality research personnel who will help expand KIST's capacity and expertise in original technology research.\n\nKIST has been actively promoting international cooperation through joint research projects, scientist exchange programs, and the sponsorship of international workshops and symposia. Cooperative agreements exist with over 70 research institutes in 27 different countries and this number is expected to expand significantly in coming years.\n\nIn addition to KIST Europe, KIST has also founded the Indo-Korea Science and Technology Center to utilize India's abundant S&T potential and lay the groundwork for trade cooperation with one of the largest markets in the world. The Indo-Korea Science and technology center (IKST) was established in 2010 and since then IKST has focused on the commercialization of technology developed by KIST, Korea. The IKST has extended its capability to research and development collaboration with India from November 2013. For this Dr. Seung-Cheol Lee, the R&D director has been dispatched from Korea to promote R&D activity in India. Currently projects on computational Material Science and developing user interface for facilitating massive calculations are going on.\n\nKIST is also engaged in transferring to developing countries its experience and the technologies that have led to Korea's successful industrialization.

It supported candidates for election to the municipal councils and school boards of the six municipalities that made up Metro Toronto. The party was organized by supporters of the social democratic New Democratic Party of Canada, and its provincial wing, the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP).\n\nElections in Toronto and its suburbs, as in other municipalities in the Province of Ontario, have traditionally not been the domain of formal political parties. Candidates for election to municipal councils and school boards typically run as individuals, and not as members of political parties.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, New Democrats in Metro Toronto attempted to introduce party politics by using campaign materials featuring a \"Metro NDP\" logo, and by forming an official NDP caucus on Toronto city council. Not all New Democratic city councillors chose to use the NDP colours and logos, however.\n\nSince there was no mechanism for parties to register or to operate officially on the municipal level, the NDP operation was largely informal. Local ward associations were set up to nominate candidates in a number of wards, particularly downtown wards, but no party name ever appeared on a ballot - and there was no mechanism for the Metro NDP to accept election donations.\n\nThe attempt to introduce party politics had limited success. Most officials elected came from downtown Toronto: only a handful came from the suburbs.\n\nIn 1991 the Toronto NDP held a convention and nominated Jack Layton as its mayoral candidate - the first and last official NDP nominee for the position although CCFer Jimmy Simpson was Mayor of Toronto in 1935 and NDP member William Dennison was mayor from 1966 to 1972. Layton was unsuccessful in his mayoral run losing to June Rowlands.\n\nThe growing unpopularity of the Bob Rae government resulted in incumbent NDP councillors and trustees running without a party label in the 1994 municipal election. Thus ended the NDP's formal presence in Toronto municipal politics.\n\nA stronger than expected performance by NDP-aligned councillors running as independents provided a strong argument against reviving party affiliations in the 1997 or subsequent elections.\n\nWhile members of the NDP co-operate on city council and on the Toronto District School Board, there is no longer an official NDP caucus.\n\nAt various times, the Liberals have also attempted to run candidates in Toronto municipal elections, most notably in 1969 when Professor Stephen Clarkson was the nominee of the \"Civic Liberals\" for the mayor's office. Clarkson came third.\n\nMore recently, the name \"Metro NDP\" has been revived in order to refer to a regional organization of Ontario NDP provincial riding associations in Toronto rather than to a municipal political party.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175836", "title": "Hering illusion", "text": "Hering illusion\n\nThe Hering illusion is one of the geometrical-optical illusions and was discovered by the German physiologist Ewald Hering in 1861. When two straight and parallel lines are presented in front of radial background (like the spokes of a bicycle), the lines appear as if they were bowed outwards. The Orbison illusion is one of its variants, while the Wundt illusion produces a similar, but inverted effect.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for why perceptual distortion produced by the radiating pattern. The illusion was ascribed by Hering to an overestimation of the angle made at the points of intersection. If true, then the straightness of the parallel lines yields to that of the radiating lines, implying that there is a hierarchical ordering among components of such illusion. Others have suggested that angle overestimation results from lateral inhibition in visual cortex, while others have postulated a bias inherent in extrapolating 3D angle information from 2D projections.\n\nA different framework suggests that the Hering illusion (and several other geometric illusions) are caused by temporal delays with which the visual system must cope. In this framework, the visual system extrapolates current information to “perceive the present”: instead of providing a conscious image of how the world was ~100 ms in the past (when signals first struck the retina), the visual system estimates how the world is likely to look in the next moment. In the case of the Hering illusion, the radial lines trick the visual system into thinking it is moving forward. Since we are not actually moving and the figure is static, we misperceive the straight lines as curved—as they would appear in the next moment.\n\nIt is possible that both frameworks are compatible. The Hering illusion can also be induced by \na background of optic flow (such as dots flowing out from the center of a screen, creating the illusion of forward motion through a starfield). Importantly, the bowing direction is the same whether the flow moves inward or outward. This result is consistent with a role for networks of visual orientation-tuned neurons (e.g., simple cells in primary visual cortex) in the spatial warping. In this framework, under the common condition of forward ego-motion, it is possible that spatial warping counteracts the disadvantage of neural latencies. However, it also demonstrates that any spatial warping that counteracts neural delays is not a precise, on-the-fly computation, but instead a heuristic achieved by a simple mechanism that succeeds under normal circumstances.\n\nResearcher Mark Changizi explained the illusion in a 2008 article:\n\n\"Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future. The converging lines toward a vanishing point (the spokes) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are moving forward as we would in the real world, where the door frame (a pair of vertical lines) seems to bow out as we move through it and we try to perceive what that world will look like in the next instant.\"\n"}

The original temple was built in 1585, but was later destroyed by fire and rebuilt in the 19th century. It is located East of Dana Street in the Yuquan District, just across the road from the Da Zhao Temple.\n\nThe monastery which covers an area of 13,160 square meters is a distinct blend of Han and Tibetan architecture, reflecting its intercultural influences. This temple has acted as the official residence of a Living Buddha, the English translation of the Chinese term for an incarnate lama, since 1735 and remains so this day, housing the 11th Grand Living Buddha.

He is best known today for the Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nWilliamson was born in 1824 in Wandsworth, London, the second of three children of Alexander Williamson (originally from Elgin) a clerk with the East India Company and his wife, Antonia McAndrew, daughter of a prominent London merchant. Despite early physical infirmity, the loss of sight in one eye and a largely useless left arm, Williamson grew up in a caring and stimulating intellectual environment. After an early childhood spent in Brighton and then schools in Kensington, Williams enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in 1841. After working under Leopold Gmelin at Heidelberg, he transferred to the University of Giessen to work with Justus von Liebig, where he received his Ph.D. in 1845. Williamson then spent three years in Paris studying higher mathematics under Auguste Comte.\n\nIn 1849, with the support of Thomas Graham, Williamson was appointed professor of analytical and practical chemistry at University College, London. From Graham's resignation in 1855 until Williamson's retirement in 1887, Williamson also held the chair of general (theoretical) chemistry.\n\nAs a result of this increase in income, he was able to marry Emma Catherine Key, the third daughter of Thomas Hewitt Key, in 1855. They had two children: Oliver Key (d. 1941) and Alice Maude. Alice Maud Williamson married the physicist Alfred Henry Fison (1857–1923). \n\nWilliamson died on 6 May 1904, at High Pitfold, Shottermill near Haslemere in Surrey, England, and was buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.\n\nWilliamson is credited for his research on the formation of unsymmetrical ethers by the interaction of an alkoxide with a haloalkane, known as the Williamson ether synthesis. He regarded ether and alcohol as substances analogous to and built up on the same type as water, and he further introduced the water-type as a widely applicable basis for the classification of chemical compounds. The method of stating the rational constitution of bodies by comparison with water he believed capable of wide extension, and that one type, he thought, would suffice for all inorganic compounds, as well as for the best-known organic ones, the formula of water being taken in certain cases as doubled or tripled.\n\nSo far back as 1850 he also suggested a view which, in a modified form, is of fundamental importance in the modern theory of ionic dissociation, for, in a paper on the theory of the formation of ether, he urged that in an aggregate of molecules of any compound there is an exchange constantly going on between the elements which are contained in it; for instance, in hydrochloric acid each atom of hydrogen does not remain quietly in juxtaposition with the atom of chlorine with which it first united, but changes places with other atoms of hydrogen. A somewhat similar hypothesis was put forward by Rudolf Clausius about the same time.\n\nIn 1863 five students from the Chōshū clan were smuggled out of Japan. At the time Japan was still a closed society; the laws of the Tokugawa Shogunate making travel to another country a capital offence. After an arduous journey reaching London, the students were placed under the care of Professor Williamson. He and his wife Catherine welcomed the group into their home, taught them English, introduced them to western society, and arranged for them to study as non-matriculated students at University College London. Itō Shunsuke (later Itō Hirobumi), Endō Kinsuke and Nomura Yakichi (later Inoue Masaru) lived with the Williamsons at their Camden home, while Inoue Monta (later Inoue Kaoru), and Yamao Yōzō lived adjacent to the university in Gower Street. \n\nThe Chōshū Five as they later became known all served in the Japanese government, and made significant scientific and social contributions to the modernisation of Japan. Fourteen more international Japanese students, from the Satsuma clan, later worked with Williamson beginning in 1865.\n\n For his work on etherification, Williamson received a Royal medal from the Royal Society in 1862, of which he became a fellow in 1855, and which he served as foreign secretary from 1873 to 1889. He was twice president of the London Chemical Society, from 1863–1865 and from 1869–1871.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175857", "title": "Evelyn Thomas", "text": "Evelyn Thomas\n\nEllen Lucille \"Evelyn\" Thomas (born 22 August 1953) is an American singer from Chicago, Illinois, best known for the Hi-NRG dance hits \"High Energy\", \"Masquerade\", \"Standing at the Crossroads\", \"Reflections\", and \"Weak Spot\".\n\nThomas has an entertainment incorporated company, called Eljopan Entertainment Incorporated.\n\nAlthough best known worldwide for her 1980s Hi-NRG club hits, Thomas recorded and performed in disco, jazz, and gospel music styles for a decade before her successful stint in the 1980s. Discovered by British producer Ian Levine, who was in the US in 1975 scouting for gospel and soul singers he could promote in the UK, the two recorded several tracks which resulted in a contract with 20th Century Records. Evelyn Thomas scored a chart hit with her first single, reaching the UK Top 30 in 1976 with the single \"Weak Spot,\" co-written by Levine and Paul David Wilson . A follow-up single, \"Doomsday\", entered the UK charts twice but each time floundered in the lower reaches, and sticky contract issues complicated her newfound success, though Levine and Thomas would continue their association for quite some time. She signed to US label Casablanca Records for her first album release \"I Wanna Make It on My Own\", released 1978. With Casablanca doing little to promote the LP, she switched to AVI Records for the double A-side 12\" single \"Have a Little Faith in Me\" / \"No Time to Turn Around\" which prompted the label to release it as an LP, backed with Rick Gianatos' extended remixes of her 1976 tracks \"My Head's in the Stars\" and \"Love's Not Just an Illusion\". For a follow-up, Evelyn Thomas re-recorded three tracks from an aborted project by Levine's group Moonstone, \"Love in the First Degree\", \"Summer on the Beach\" and \"Sleaze\" (originally entitled \"Out of the Ball Game\") but with the disco backlash in the US, the tracks were left unreleased.\n\nAlthough disco music had been declared \"dead\" in the US in a backlash in 1979, several songs which continued and advanced the exuberant surge of uptempo dance music managed to scale the US pop charts in the intervening years, notably Blondie's \"Call Me\" in 1980, Laura Branigan's \"Gloria\" in 1982, and Irene Cara's \"Flashdance (What A Feeling)\" in 1983. Unwilling to use the term \"disco\", the phrase \"high energy\" had come into usage, probably begun in England in the early 1980s. By 1984 Ian Levine had re-established himself as a producer and asked Evelyn Thomas to come to London to record a new track \"High Energy\". Just few weeks after it was released, it zoomed up the charts all over Europe - peaking at No. 1 in Germany and No. 5 in the UK. In the US it hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, selling 250,000 copies. The song was her only \"Billboard\" Hot 100 entry, peaking at No. 85, although three additional songs hit the Billboard dance chart. \nBy 1984, the phrase had become embraced as a term by DJs across Europe and in the States, particularly in gay clubs where DJs who preferred to play records that surpassed a certain BPM (Beats Per Minute) threshold found many mainstream hits lagging in tempo. Evolving around that time to the abbreviated \"Hi-Energy,\" the term soon became further shortened to \"Hi-NRG\", and was still widely in use more than two decades later to describe a certain genre of uptempo dance music.\n\nThe follow-up single \"Masquerade\" was taken from her third album \"High Energy\", released the same year. While it received heavy rotation in European clubs, it failed to break into the UK Top 40. In the US the song was a top-twenty Dance hit. The following year, \"Heartless\" became her only single other than \"High Energy\" to chart outside of the Club/Dance charts in the United States. \"Heartless\" peaked at No. 84 on the Black Singles chart (later renamed the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart) in 1985.\n\nThough she would not return to the US pop or R&B charts, US dancefloors continued to move to the fast beat of Evelyn Thomas. With a cover of The Supremes' 1967 hit \"Reflections\", updated in her Hi-NRG style, Thomas peaked at No. 18 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1986, the same year in which Kim Wilde had a similarly styled hit with the Supremes' \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\". A second Thomas release that summer fared even better on those charts, as \"How Many Hearts\" narrowly missed the top 10. The two songs would later appear on Thomas' fourth album release, \"Standing at the Crossroads\", in 1987. In late 1987, the single \"No Win Situation\" shot to No. 1 on the now defunct UK Hi-NRG Charts. After the singles \"Only Once in a Lifetime\" (1988) and \"This Is Madness\" (1989), both on Levine's Nightmare Records label, Thomas withdrew from the music business.\n\nIn spring 1997, Redemption featuring Evelyn Thomas had a minor US club hit with the track \"Tell The World\".\n\nA new remix of her largest hit was released in 2004 as \"High Energy 2004\" and became a worldwide gay club hit. The remix was released on Dance Street/ZYX Records out of Germany in early 2005. The remix secured moderate radio and club play on the Stateside. This song was then ripped off by Daz Sampson in 2005 who tried to get it released in the UK before the Germans could release their remix.\n\nIn May 2008, Evelyn Thomas took part in the major RTL Disco Tour, performing in 15 cities throughout France. While in Europe, Thomas completed several new recordings in different countries with the aim of making a comeback. She has teamed up with Ian Levine for the first time in 20 years, recording the tracks \"Pounding the Pavement\", \"One in a Million\" and \"I Can't Give You the World\". She has recorded four tracks, \"Stick to the Plan\", \"Missing the Target\", \"Infidelity\" and the ballad \"Why Must the Sunrise\" for a diva album called \"The Plan\" for Night Dance Records, produced by Scandinavian songwriter Søren Jensen in collaboration with Clive Scott, formerly of Jigsaw. Thomas has also teamed up with French team Evolusound for a single release, \"Prove It\", written and produced by Frank Savannah and remixed by Laurent Schark.\n\nIn 2009, Thomas released a duet with Carol Jiani, \"Are You Man Enough\", produced by the Australian team of Peter Wilson and Chris Richards a.k.a. T1 Productions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2175858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175858", "title": "ISM Connect 300", "text": "ISM Connect 300\n\nThe ISM Connect 300 was a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series stock car race that was , traditionally held in mid-September at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, New Hampshire, the other one being the New Hampshire 301 in July.\n\nThe New England 300 also has the distinction of being the only NASCAR Cup Series points race outside Daytona and Talladega to run a restrictor plate race since the adoption of the current 358 cubic inch formula. After Adam Petty's fatal crash in the Busch Series practice on May 12, 2000, and Kenny Irwin Jr.'s fatal crash in the Cup Series practice on July 7, 2000, NASCAR decided to run restrictor plates, already used for the Whelen Modified Tour races at the circuit, for the 2000 Cup race, then known as the Dura Lube 300 sponsored by Kmart. Adding restrictor plates did have the desired result of slowing down the cars drastically, but at the same time, restricted passing so much that Jeff Burton led all 300 laps. This lack of passing was so noncompetitive, that for Cup cars only, the restrictor plates were gone for the very next race, the 2001 New England 300.\n\nFrom 2004 until 2010, the race served as the opening round of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoffs, a ten-race \"playoff\" designed among the top ten (twelve as of 2007) drivers in the standings of the series following the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 to spur interest in a championship series while NASCAR faces competition from the start of the NFL season and college football, the pennant races and post-season of Major League Baseball and the outset of the NHL and NBA seasons. Beginning with the 2011 Chase, the race became the second race in the ten-race playoff; as in part of a new round of schedule realignment the Overton's 400 at Chicagoland Speedway moved from its traditional early July race date. On March 8, 2017 it was announced that the fall NHMS date would move to Las Vegas Motor Speedway starting in 2018.\n\nThe first race in September came at the expense of the fall race at North Wilkesboro Speedway which was one of eight tracks from the original 1949 season, this race which took the date from NWS, has its lineage starting in 1949 but the first race was ran here in 1997, won by Jeff Gordon, who also coincidentally won the last race at North Wilkesboro.\n\nThis was the first NASCAR Cup Series race held since the deaths of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. at this track. NASCAR used restrictor plates for this race as a result, in an effort to slow the top speed of the cars. However, cautions were so frequent and passing was so slowed that outside polesitter Jeff Burton led all 300 laps. This is the only race to date on a short track that had used restrictor plates. They were not used again after this race.\n\nThe 2001 fall race, originally scheduled for September 16, 2001, was postponed due to the 9/11 terror attacks. Not wanting to cancel the event outright, NASCAR decided to reschedule the race to the next available date. Since there were no scheduled off weeks between then and the end of the season, NASCAR's only option was the weekend of November 23–25, 2001, Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThis created an interesting challenge for Goodyear, the tire manufacturer, as they were not expecting to run a race in New Hampshire in November. With the potential for a much colder raceday than they would have had in September at Loudon, and taking into account the possibility for snow, Goodyear brought a tire that they hoped would be better suited to the cold conditions. NASCAR announced the rescheduled race date would be Friday, November 23, the day after Thanksgiving, to allow for potential weather-related rescheduling. NBC was to carry the race live in the Eastern, Central, and Mountain time zones, with a tape delay for the Pacific time zone to accommodate the third hour of \"Today\".\n\nHowever, NASCAR's concerns were unfounded as the race was run in unseasonably mild conditions with temperatures in the 50s. NASCAR didn't conduct a traditional qualifying event for this race, instead choosing to employ a modified version of its method used when qualifying is canceled due to weather. To set the field for the race the cars that were holding the top 43 positions in the standings following the September 8 Chevrolet Monte Carlo 400 at Richmond automatically qualified for the race. Only 42 of those cars started the race, as 43rd-place Eel River Racing had folded shortly after the Richmond race.\n\nThe race saw Robby Gordon, driving the #31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing, win his first ever race in NASCAR, and was marked by an incident in which he and Jeff Gordon got tangled together late in the race which put Robby into the lead. Jeff, who had been running up front all day, hit Robby during a caution flag to retaliate and finished in the middle of the pack (although it was all moot, as Gordon had clinched the 2001 Winston Cup championship at Atlanta the week before).\n\nThe 2003 race marked the last time that the long-standing NASCAR rule of racing back to a yellow caution flag was in place. During the race, Dale Jarrett spun and hit the wall in turn 4 and came to rest in the middle of the racetrack's front stretch. Leaders slowed down except Michael Waltrip, who attempted to put several cars a lap down; he and others raced past Jarrett's immobilized car at full speed and some barely avoided contact with him. Beginning with the next race, the MBNA America 400 at Dover, in addition to other rule changes for the NASCAR Cup Series, Busch, and Truck series, NASCAR outlawed racing back to the caution. Instead, NASCAR froze the field immediately at the caution and allowed the first car one lap down (or multiple laps down, if there were no cars one lap down) to rejoin the lead lap; this is officially called the \"free pass\" by NASCAR but is widely known by fans and journalists as the \"lucky dog\" rule.\n\nThe 2004 Sylvania 300 was the first time drivers raced in the Chase for the Nextel Cup format. Rain cancelled qualifying, prompting the grid to be set from owner's points. Jeff Gordon led them down to the green flag. Afterward, Greg Biffle got in the back of Robby Gordon sending Gordon spinning. Later in the race Robby Gordon spun Biffle collecting Chase contenders Tony Stewart and Jeremy Mayfield. Robby Gordon was penalized two laps for aggressive driving. Kurt Busch won the race to start his run toward his first Nextel Cup Series championship.\n\nThe 2017 race marked the last time that NASCAR would come here in the fall for the second race in the Playoffs. On March 8, 2017 it was announced that the fall NHMS date would move to Las Vegas Motor Speedway starting in 2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2175875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175875", "title": "KSNB-TV", "text": "KSNB-TV\n\nKSNB-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 4, is a dual NBC/MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Superior, Nebraska, United States, serving southeastern and central Nebraska. The station is owned by Gray Television, as part of a duopoly with Lincoln-licensed CBS affiliate KOLN (channel 10) and its semi-satellite KGIN (channel 11) in Grand Island; it is also sister to low-powered CW+ affiliate KCWH-LD (channel 18). KSNB-TV's transmitter is located near York, Nebraska. Its news operations are primarily based at a studio located north of Hastings on US 281 that housed the area's former NBC affiliate, KHAS-TV (channel 5, now dual MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate and former KSNB-TV satellite station, KNHL); with a secondary news bureau and sales office on West State Street in Grand Island. Master control and some internal operations are based at KOLN's facilities on North 40th Street in Lincoln. Since KSNB's signal is spotty in Lincoln proper, it is simulcast in high definition on the second digital subchannel of KOLN/KGIN.\n\nKSNB is officially part of the Lincoln–Hastings–Kearney market, which spans 42 counties in Nebraska—almost two-thirds of the state's land—and four counties in Kansas. Until recently, the market had no basis in television reality and was only fully realized on the local DirecTV and Dish Network feeds. However, with the conversion of KSNB to NBC, the market now shares all major network affiliates except for ABC, as the western, central and northern parts of the market receive ABC from KHGI-TV (channel 13) while Lincoln and the eastern portion of the market receives ABC from KLKN (channel 8).\n\nKSNB signed on the air on October 1, 1965 as KHTL-TV, and was part of the ABC-affiliated Nebraska Television Network (NTN, subsequently rebranded to NTV) alongside KHOL-TV (channel 13, now KHGI-TV) in Kearney, KHPL-TV (channel 6, now KWNB-TV) in Hayes Center and KHQL-TV (channel 8) in Albion (later joined by K13VO, now KHGI-CD, in North Platte). NTV Enterprises acquired the NTV stations from original owner Bi-States Company in 1974 for $1.9 million. On June 3, the new owners changed channel 4's call letters to KSNB-TV, as its signal reached parts of Kansas in addition to Nebraska.\n\nJoseph Amaturo bought the NTV stations in 1979 in an $8.5 million deal funded by the sale of KQTV in St. Joseph, Missouri. KCNA was split off from NTV on November 1, 1983 to become an independent station under the call letters KBGT-TV; Amaturo Group sold KSNB-TV, KHGI-TV, and KWNB-TV to Gordon Broadcasting for $10 million in 1985; the sale separated the NTV stations from KBGT, which was separately sold a year later to Citadel Communications and became KCAN, a satellite of Sioux City, Iowa station KCAU-TV. Citadel later moved KCAN to Lincoln as a stand-alone station, KLKN.\n\nGordon Broadcasting planned to sell the NTV stations to Sterling Communications for $11 million in 1989. However, later that year, the stations were placed into receivership; initially overseen by former owner Joseph Amaturo, Joseph Girard was appointed successor receiver in 1991. Under Girard, who operated NTV through Girard Communications, KSNB-TV, KHGI-TV, and KWNB-TV were sold to Fant Broadcasting, owner of WNAL-TV in Gadsden, Alabama, for $2 million in 1993.\n\nOn April 1, 1994, Fant took over the operations of Hill Broadcasting Company's KTVG (channel 17), an upstart independent station in Grand Island in the process of joining Fox, under a local marketing agreement (LMA), making it a sister station to the NTV stations. Concurrently with KTVG's primary Fox affiliation, KSNB-TV, KHGI-TV, and KWNB-TV took on a secondary Fox affiliation to carry the network's NFL coverage. In July 1995, Fant announced a deal to sell KSNB, KHGI, and KWNB to Blackstar, LLC, a minority-controlled company in which nonvoting equity interests were held by Fox Television Stations and Silver King Communications, for $13 million; although the deal, which would have seen the NTV stations switch to a full-time Fox affiliation, was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 15, 1995, Fant cited delays in FCC approval in walking away from the deal in May 1996.\n\nIn July 1996, Fant agreed to sell KSNB-TV, KHGI-TV, and KWNB-TV to Pappas Telecasting for $12.75 million. Pappas immediately assumed control of the NTV stations through a local marketing agreement that began on July 1, and that September broke KSNB off from NTV and made it a Fox affiliate as a satellite of KTVG; the two served as the Fox affiliate for the western portion of the sprawling market. KHGI and KWNB remained ABC affiliates. In 1997, Pappas sold its right to acquire KSNB to Colins Broadcasting Company for $10 (with Colins paying $333,333 to Fant), as channel 4's signal overlapped with Pappas' Omaha station, KPTM; Pappas also entered into an LMA with Colins to continue operating KSNB. The sales of KHGI and KWNB to Pappas and KSNB to Colins were approved by the FCC on February 17, 1999 and completed on May 24.\nKSNB-TV and KTVG dropped a secondary affiliation with UPN in January 1998; however, the network's programming returned in late 2000, and would remain until KOLN and KGIN channel 11 launched a UPN-affiliated subchannel on September 1, 2005. The network shut down a year later in favor of The CW, which was picked up by KCWL-TV (channel 51), owned by the \"Omaha World-Herald\" and operated by Pappas. Also in 2000, KSNB and KTVG added a secondary affiliation with Pax, renamed i: Independent Television on July 1, 2005 and Ion Television on January 29, 2007. The Ion affiliation was later discontinued.\n\nPrior to June 2009, the stations were identified on-air as \"Nebraska Fox 4 & 17.\" KSNB and KTVG began broadcasting network programming in high-definition on January 1, 2009 prior to the broadcast of the Orange Bowl.\n\nKSNB was hampered by opting to return to channel 4 after the June 12, 2009 transition date (its digital signal had broadcast on UHF channel 34 before then), as the issue of lower VHF frequencies not transmitting well in digital (along with KSNB being one of the few stations digitally on channel 4 in the country) meant the station's coverage area was less than what had been mapped, and the lack of viewers with VHF-optimized digital antennas further complicated the situation. This likely led Pappas to switch Lincoln's KCWL from The CW to Fox as KFXL-TV, in order to maintain Fox service to southern Nebraska in a way that KSNB could not. When KFXL became a Fox station, KTVG and KSNB became its satellites. All three stations became branded as \"KFXL, Fox Nebraska.\"\n\nThe time brokerage agreement between Pappas Telecasting and Colins Broadcasting expired on November 30, 2009. As a result, KSNB and its two translators were removed from the Fox Nebraska network and shut down on December 1 (a third Colins-owned translator, K17CI in Beatrice, Nebraska, had left the air on June 12, 2009). KTVG soon followed in April 2010, leaving KFXL as the market's sole Fox station.\n\nIn 2010, Colins put the dormant KSNB license up for sale. The station was broadcasting intermittently as an affiliate of the Three Angels Broadcasting Network. On June 23, 2011, Colins Broadcasting filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to increase the ERP of the station to 23.5 kW, moving the transmitter site to the existing tower of FM radio station KTMX, near York, roughly northeast of the original site and closer to Lincoln.\n\nOn November 21, 2012, it was announced that Gray Television, the owners of KOLN/KGIN, would acquire KSNB for $1.25 million. The Lincoln–Hastings–Kearney market has only five full-power stations (KOLN/KGIN and KHGI/KWNB are both counted as single stations for ratings and regulatory purposes), not enough to legally permit a duopoly. Colins and Gray sought a \"failed station\" waiver to allow the acquisition to move forward. The station deal included Lincoln translators K18CD and KWAZ-LP. On February 15, 2013, the FCC granted the assignment of the license to Gray, with the sale officially completed on February 25.\n\nKSNB aired programming from Antenna TV in the interim on channels 4.1 and 4.2 from the newly licensed facilities near York, as well as on its digital K18CD-D and analog KWAZ-LP translators in Lincoln. The affiliation agreement with Antenna TV was exclusively intended for the station's second digital subchannel, but was carried on the primary digital channel as well while the station ownership changed hands. On April 1, 2013, the station took the MyNetworkTV affiliation previously held by the second digital subchannels of both KOLN and KGIN under the moniker \"10/11 Central Nebraska.\" It also resumed a general entertainment programming schedule and introduced increased local programming, including the expected addition of local high school sports coverage. The second digital subchannel eventually began to also carry the same programming as the main channel, replacing Antenna TV. On September 2, 2013, KSNB became an affiliate of MeTV; the network provides the majority of the station's schedule, with MyNetworkTV programming airing from 12:00 to 2:00 a.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Soon after KSNB returned to the air full-time, it was added to all cable systems on the Lincoln side of the market as part of the retransmission consent compensation for carrying KOLN.\n\nOn June 11, 2014, Hastings-based KHAS-TV (channel 5), the longtime NBC affiliate for the western part of the Lincoln market, announced on its website and Facebook page that it would leave the air at midnight on June 13. KHAS' owner, Hoak Media, had recently merged with Gray, and original plans called for it to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting to satisfy duopoly rules. Gray would have operated the station under a local marketing agreement (LMA). However, increased FCC scrutiny of LMAs prompted Gray to shut down KHAS. On the day KHAS-TV shut down, its NBC affiliation, syndicated programming, and news department moved to KSNB and the second subchannels of KOLN and KGIN. KSNB's MyNetworkTV and MeTV programming moved to its second digital subcarrier, as well as a third digital channel on KOLN and KGIN, with all channels being broadcast in high definition. Over-the-air viewers actually benefited from the switch, as it gave NBC a full-market affiliate for the first time ever. For most of the broadcasting era, KMTV and WOWT in Omaha (a sister station to KSNB and KOLN/KGIN) had doubled as Lincoln's NBC affiliate as well.\n\nWith the change, Charter Spectrum's Lincoln system (and surrounding smaller systems near Lincoln) carries the 4.2 subchannel on the channels occupied by KSNB and the primary 4.1 channel on the channels formerly occupied by Omaha-based WOWT. WOWT was moved to a standard-definition digital tier channel position following KSNB's NBC affiliation and later dropped altogether. Lincoln-area cable systems historically have never carried KHAS, instead opting to carry WOWT. As of August 2014 other Lincoln-area cable systems including Zito Media have continued to carry WOWT as the default local NBC affiliate.\n\nKSNB briefly retained KHAS-TV's former branding, \"News 5.\" It rebranded to \"NBC Nebraska\" on October 1, 2014, and then to \"Local 4\" on October 25, 2017.\n\nOn May 21, 2018, Gray agreed to acquire KNHL from Legacy Broadcasting for $475,000; in filing for FCC approval of the purchase in September 2018, Gray proposed to operate the station as a satellite of KSNB. The FCC approved the sale on February 12, 2019, and the sale was finalized on March 1.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKSNB-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 34 to VHF channel 4.\n\nWith the sale to Gray Television, KSNB began to air two half-hour daily newscasts produced by KOLN: an early evening broadcast at 5:30 p.m. on weeknights and a nightly primetime newscast at 9:00 p.m. Both newscasts, which debuted on April 1, 2013, are broadcast in high definition and originate from KOLN's studios on North 40th Street on the northeast side of Lincoln. With the move of KHAS-TV's programming to KSNB-TV's primary channel, the station inherited KHAS' separate news operation and newscasts; the second digital subchannel continued to air the two KOLN-produced newscasts, though the 5:30 and 9:00 newscasts have since been dropped.\n\nKSNB-TV formerly repeated its programming on one translator station, K18CD-D, licensed to Lincoln. On October 20, 2017, the broadcast tower for the Lincoln translator collapsed, rendering the translator out of commission. It returned to the air September 26, 2018 as CW affiliate KCWH-LD.\n\n\n"}

In this episode, which takes place in the \"Star Trek\" universe explores various characters and factions of the show.\n\nThis episode was filmed before the previous episode, but aired after it. Director Paul Lynch had previously directed five episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nOdo has become worried at the number of new people arriving at the station due to the newly discovered Bajoran wormhole. While talking with Quark in his bar, Odo observes a man he recognizes and demands he leave the station. The man refuses and the two get into a fight that is broken up by Sisko. Odo explains to Sisko that the man is Ibudan, a smuggler of goods to Bajorans during the Cardassian Occupation. Though considered a hero by some, Odo states that Ibudan let a young girl die when her parents could not afford the smuggled goods, and later killed a Cardassian officer. He has since gone free after the end of the Occupation. Sisko warns Odo that he cannot take action against Ibudan without any evidence of a crime being committed.\n\nLater, Ibudan is found dead in one of Quark's holosuites. One of Ibudan's friends reports to Sisko and Kira that Ibudan was afraid Odo would kill him. No DNA is found at the scene of Ibudan's murder other than that of Ibudan and the officers investigating the crime; the general populace of the station start to become suspicious of Odo, whom they consider untrustworthy due to his unknown origin as a shapeshifter and his past association with the Cardassian regime. Sisko orders a formal investigation and temporarily relieves Odo of duty as head of security. Bashir discovers that Ibudan was performing medical experiments on a strange material in his quarters despite having no training as a doctor or scientist. Bashir continues to observe the samples in Sick Bay.\n\nThe crowds on the station become more hostile believing Odo is the murderer, and Odo is forced to hide in his office to avoid a mob forming outside despite Sisko's attempts to calm them down. Bashir suddenly arrives with new evidence: the sample from Ibudan has started growing into a clone of Ibudan. Sisko, Bashir and Odo determine that the murdered Ibudan was also another clone, set up to incriminate Odo. They discover the real Ibudan hiding on the station, and now with evidence, Odo is able to arrest him for the murder of his clone, but receives no apologies from the inhabitants of the station.\n\nIn a side plot, Miles O'Brien struggles to help his wife Keiko O'Brien get used to living on the station, as she is unable to follow her interests. She offers to start a school to teach the children residing on the station, and persuades Sisko and Rom to enroll their children (respectively, Jake and Nog).\n\n\"A Man Alone\" first aired on January 18, 1993. It received a Nielsen rating of 13.0 percent, placing third in its timeslot.\n\nIn 2013, Tor.com's Keith DeCandido gave the episode a warp factor rating of 2/10, writing, \"There are moments here and there—the conversation between Sisko and Dax at the beginning is a good one, likewise Sisko reminiscing about Curzon to Bashir, and Rene Auberjonois’s performance is superb—but ultimately, the episode just fails on almost every level.\"\n\nIn 2012, \"The A.V. Club\"'s Zack Handlen praised René Auberjonois's portrayal of Odo, but criticized the episode as cliché, writing it was \"not awful, but it's not good, either\".\n\nThis episode is noted as the first episode of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" to include Keiko and Molly, previously introduced on \"\".\n\nIn 2019, Tor.com noted this as an \"essential\" for the character of Odo, remarking how it established him as isolated from the rest of the crew.\n\n"}

{"id": "2175894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175894", "title": "Vojtěch Jarník", "text": "Vojtěch Jarník\n\nVojtěch Jarník (; 1897–1970) was a Czech mathematician who worked for many years as a professor and administrator at Charles University, and helped found the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He is the namesake of Jarník's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.\n\nJarník worked in number theory, mathematical analysis, and graph algorithms. He has been called \"probably the first Czechoslovak mathematician whose scientific works received wide and lasting international response\". As well as developing Jarník's algorithm, he found tight bounds on the number of lattice points on convex curves, studied the relationship between the Hausdorff dimension of sets of real numbers and how well they can be approximated by rational numbers, and investigated the properties of nowhere-differentiable functions.\n\nJarník was born December 22, 1897. He was the son of , a professor of Romance language philology at Charles University, and his older brother, Hertvík Jarník, also became a professor of linguistics. Despite this background, Jarník learned no Latin at his gymnasium (the C.K. české vyšší reálné gymnasium, Ječná, Prague), so when he entered Charles University in 1915 he had to do so as an extraordinary student until he could pass a Latin examination three semesters later.\n\nHe studied mathematics and physics at Charles University from 1915 to 1919, with Karel Petr as a mentor. After completing his studies, he became an assistant to Jan Vojtěch at the Brno University of Technology, where he also met Mathias Lerch. In 1921 he completed a doctoral degree (RNDr.) at Charles University with a dissertation on Bessel functions supervised by Petr, then returned to Charles University as Petr's assistant.\n\nWhile keeping his position at Charles University, he studied with Edmund Landau at the University of Göttingen from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1927 to 1929. On his first return to Charles University he defended his habilitation, and on his return from the second visit, he was given a chair in mathematics as an extraordinary professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1935 and later served as Dean of Sciences (1947–1948) and Vice-Rector (1950–1953).\nHe retired in 1968.\n\nJarník supervised the dissertations of 16 doctoral students.\nNotable among these are Miroslav Katětov, a chess master who became rector of Charles University, Jaroslav Kurzweil, known for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral,\nand Slovak mathematician Tibor Šalát.\n\nHe died September 22, 1970.\n\nAlthough Jarník's 1921 dissertation, like some of his later publications, was in mathematical analysis, his main area of work was in number theory. He studied the Gauss circle problem and proved a number of results on Diophantine approximation, lattice point problems, and the geometry of numbers. He also made pioneering, but long-neglected, contributions to combinatorial optimization.\n\nThe Gauss circle problem asks for the number of points of the integer lattice enclosed by a given circle.\nOne of Jarník's theorems (1926), related to this problem, is that any convex curve with length passes through\nat most\npoints of the integer lattice. The formula_2 in this formula is an instance of Big O notation. Neither the exponent of nor the leading constant of this bound can be improved, as there exist convex curves with this many grid points.\n\nAnother theorem of Jarník in this area shows that, for any closed convex curve in the plane with a well-defined length, the absolute difference between the area it encloses and the number of integer points it encloses is at most its length.\n\nJarník also published several results in Diophantine approximation, the study of the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers.\nHe proved (1928–1929) that the badly approximable real numbers (the ones with bounded terms in their continued fractions) have Hausdorff dimension one. This is the same dimension as the set of all real numbers, intuitively suggesting that the set of badly approximable numbers is large. He also considered the numbers \nfor which there exist infinitely many good rational approximations , with\nfor a given exponent , and proved (1929) that these have the smaller Hausdorff dimension . The second of these results was later rediscovered by Besicovitch. Besicovitch used different methods than Jarník to prove it, and the result has come to be known as the Jarník–Besicovitch theorem.\n\nJarník's work in real analysis was sparked by finding, in the unpublished works of Bernard Bolzano, a definition of a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable. Bolzano's 1830 discovery predated the 1872 publication of the Weierstrass function, previously considered to be the first example of such a function. Based on his study of Bolzano's function, Jarník was led to a more general theorem: If a real-valued function of a closed interval does not have bounded variation in any subinterval, then there is a dense subset of its domain on which at least one of its Dini derivatives is infinite. This applies in particular to the nowhere-differentiable functions, as they must have unbounded variation in all intervals. Later, after learning of a result by Stefan Banach and Stefan Mazurkiewicz that generic functions (that is, the members of a residual set of functions) are nowhere differentiable, Jarník proved that at almost all points, all four Dini derivatives of such a function are infinite. Much of his later work in this area concerned extensions of these results to approximate derivatives.\n\nIn computer science and combinatorial optimization, Jarník is known for an algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees that he published in 1930, in response to the publication of Borůvka's algorithm by another Czech mathematician, Otakar Borůvka. Jarník's algorithm builds a tree from a single starting vertex of a given weighted graph by repeatedly adding the cheapest connection to any other vertex, until all vertices have been connected.\nThe same algorithm was later rediscovered in the late 1950s by Robert C. Prim and Edsger W. Dijkstra. It is also known as Prim's algorithm or the Prim–Dijkstra algorithm.\n\nHe also published a second, related, paper with (1934) on the Euclidean Steiner tree problem. In this problem, one must again form a tree connecting a given set of points, with edge costs given by the Euclidean distance. However, additional points that are not part of the input may be added to make the overall tree shorter. This paper is the first serious treatment of the general Steiner tree problem (although it appears earlier in a letter by Gauss), and it already contains \"virtually all general properties of Steiner trees\" later attributed to other researchers.\n\nJarník was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, from 1934 as an extraordinary member and from 1946 as a regular member. In 1952 he became one of the founding members of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He was also awarded the Czechoslovak State Prize in 1952.\nThe Vojtěch Jarník International Mathematical Competition, held each year since 1991 in Ostrava, is named in his honor, as is Jarníkova Street in the Chodov district of Prague. A series of postage stamps published by Czechoslovakia in 1987 to honor the 125th anniversary of the Union of Czechoslovak mathematicians and physicists included one stamp featuring Jarník together with Joseph Petzval and Vincenc Strouhal.\n\nA conference was held in Prague, in March 1998, to honor the centennial of his birth.\n\nJarník published 90 papers in mathematics, including:\n\nHe was also the author of ten textbooks in Czech, on integral calculus, differential equations, and mathematical analysis. These books \"became classics for several generations of students\".\n\n"}

It serves the MBTA's Red Line and the MBTA Commuter Rail Old Colony Lines as well as MBTA Buses.\n\nIt is located at Ivory and Union Streets. The tracks of the Red Line and commuter rail lines are all parallel to one another, their platforms are offset; the commuter rail platform is located north of Union Street, while the Red Line platform is south of the street. The station features a large park and ride garage, with space for 1,322 automobiles. Braintree is fully accessible on all modes.\n\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 13, 1977. The station opened on March 22, 1980 for Red Line service. Between 1984 and 1988 the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad operated a state-subsidized seasonal weekend service from Braintree to Hyannis, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. Commuter rail service began on September 26, 1997, when the Old Colony Lines re-opened. The station has been accessible since at least 1989.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2007, a double entry fare and single exit fare were charged at Braintree and Quincy Adams when leaving the subway. The extra fares were discontinued as part of a fare increase and service change on January 1, 2007. Similar charges existed until 1980 on the inner stations on the Braintree Branch.\n\nAlthough built to last 50 years, the parking garage at Braintree began suffering concrete damage due to water leakage and ill-fitting structural elements. Repairs were performed to the Quincy Adams and Braintree garages in the mid 1990s. In 2015, the MBTA began a $4.4 million project to address urgent structural issues with the two garages, though full repair or replacement was still needed. Further construction on the Braintree garage took place in 2016. The deteriorated footbridge between the garage and station was closed in February 2017. The garage is being fully renovated from May 2018 through 2021 at a cost of $29 million; the station and garage will remain open during the whole project. The work includes a canopy over the ramp to the commuter rail platform, and a canopy to replace the former footbridge. 400 garage spaces closed on February 10, 2020 to allow the project to be completed by June 2021 rather than December 2021.\nThe two island platforms are highly offset, with different street entrances.\n\nThree MBTA Bus routes serve a busway next to the Red Line platform at Braintree:\n\n"}

He was an original member of the Rangers and was part of two Stanley Cup championship winning teams. He was named to the NHL's post-season all-star team four times and played in the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, the first all-star game in league history.\n\nA veteran of World War I, Johnson did not begin playing competitive hockey until he was in his 20s and was nearly 30 when he first broke into the NHL. Regarded as one of the hardest bodycheckers to ever play the game, he was a fan favourite and went on to play 436 games with the Rangers and Americans before spending his final seasons in the minor leagues as a player, coach and official. Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and is also a member of the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nJohnson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on December 7, 1898. He was an accomplished football and lacrosse player in his youth. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1916 and fought for three years in the trenches of France as part of a mortar outfit. Johnson returned to Winnipeg following the war and worked for an electric light company. He first played competitive hockey in 1919 when he joined the Winnipeg Monarchs of the Winnipeg Senior Hockey League. He played two seasons with the Monarchs before moving to Eveleth, Minnesota where he joined the local team to play three seasons in the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA). He then played three seasons in Minneapolis, concluding in 1925–26 with the Minneapolis Millers. He was named a league all-star on defence in both 1924 and 1926.\n\nFirst nicknamed \"Ivan the Terrible\", Johnson later earned the nickname \"Ching\" when fans of the defencemen would shout \"Ching, Ching Chinaman\" to support him. Though he was of Irish descent, he was called \"Chinaman\", then \"Chink\" and finally \"Ching\" as he was considered to have an Asian looking face. His physical style of defence made him immensely popular with fans, and he was often seen with a wide grin any time he made or received contact during a game.\n\nIt was from Minneapolis that Johnson was recruited, along with his defensive partner Taffy Abel, to play for the newly formed New York Rangers. Offered the position at the age of 28, Johnson insisted on a three-year contract as he believed it would be the only one he would get. He made his NHL debut in the Rangers opening game on November 16, 1926 in a 1–0 victory over the Montreal Maroons. A rugged and physical defenceman, Johnson appeared in only 27 of the Rangers' 44 games as he suffered a broken collar bone early in the season, but still finished second on the Rangers with 66 penalties in minutes. In 1927–28, his total of 146 penalty minutes led the team and was second in the NHL to Eddie Shore's 165. He added a career high 10 goals, and helped the Rangers win their first Stanley Cup. Additionally, he was voted by the fans as the most valuable player of either New York team.\n\nJohnson was lost to the Rangers early in the 1928–29 season when he suffered a broken ankle during a December game against the Maroons. A couple days after his injury, he had to be rescued when a fire threatened the Montreal hospital at which he was convalescing. Johnson missed virtually the entire regular season with the injury, but returned in time for the 1929 playoffs, and was credited with improving the Rangers' play as they reached the final against the Boston Bruins.\n\nHis contract having expired following the season, Johnson was a hold-out when the Rangers opened their training camp prior to the 1929–30 NHL season as the team was reluctant to meet his demands for increased pay. When the impasse dragged into November, he threatened to quit the game altogether before finally agreeing to a new three-year deal. He appeared in 30 games for the Rangers that season, but again missed significant time, this time suffering a broken jaw. Again, Johnson returned in time for the playoffs, but was forced to wear a steel mask to protect his face.\n\nJohnson remained healthy in 1930–31, appearing in 44 games and was named to the league's Second All-Star Team on defence. In addition to being named to the First All-Star Team in 1931–32, Johnson finished just one vote behind Howie Morenz for the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player. He was again named to the First All-Star Team in 1932–33 and led the Rangers to their second Stanley Cup; his defensive play was credited as being key to the team's success.\n\nIn 1933–34, Johnson earned his fourth consecutive post-season all-star nod, on the second team. He also participated in the first all-star game in NHL history as the league held a benefit game to raise money for Toronto's Ace Bailey, whose career had been ended by a violent hit early in the season. Johnson contemplated retirement following that season as he again found himself in a dispute with the Rangers on a new contract, but signed prior to the season's start. His season was again reduced by injury in 1934–35 but he returned in time for the playoffs.\n\nPrior to the 1936–37 season, the Rangers signed Johnson to serve as the defensive coach while he continued to play. He appeared in 35 games but scored no points. Seeing little playing time, and having an offer to coach a minor league team, Johnson requested that the Rangers give him his outright release following the season. Believing that he had become too slow to play, the team agreed. He subsequently signed with the New York Americans, with whom he played one final NHL season in 1937–38.\n\nAt age 40, Johnson returned to the Minneapolis Millers as a player-coach for the 1938–39 season. He quickly became the American Hockey Association's most popular star as large crowds attended games he participated in, and was named an AHA all-star in 1939. He served in the dual role for two years before resigning in 1940. Johnson then coached for a time in California, before returning east to coach the Washington Lions of the American Hockey League. He also served as an official in the Eastern Hockey League. During one game in 1944 in which he was working as a linesman, Johnson forgot he was no longer playing and threw a bodycheck on a player. When asked after the game about the incident, he stated it was \"instinct\" that led him to throw the hit.\n\nIn recognition of his career, Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player in 1958. He was also inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1994, and is an honoured member of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. The latter hall named him to province's all-century second all-star team.\n\nAfter leaving hockey, Johnson worked construction in Washington, D.C., and later retired to the nearby community of Silver Spring, Maryland. He and his wife Ellen had two children: Geraldine and James. He had four grandchildren and one great-grandchild at the time of his death in 1979.\n"}

PA 329 was also extended west to US 309 (now PA 873) in Neffs and a branch of the route was designated between Balliettsville and US 309/PA 29 and US 309 Byp. at the northern edge of Allentown. The section of PA 329 between Balliettsville and Allentown was decommissioned by 1950.\n\nPA 329 begins at an intersection with PA 873 in the community of Neffs in North Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley. From this intersection, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Bellview Road past housing developments, soon passing under Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) and crossing Coplay Creek. After this, the road curves east into agricultural areas with a few homes, with PA 329 making a turn southeast onto Old Post Road. The route makes a curve to the east again as it continues through more farmland with scattered residential subdivisions, passing through the community of Balliettsville. Upon entering Whitehall Township, the road becomes Main Street and passes through the residential community of Egypt before continuing past more homes and reaching the PA 145 junction. From this point, PA 329 continues northeast through residential areas and passes through the community of Cementon.\n\nUpon crossing the Lehigh River, PA 329 enters the borough of Northampton in Northampton County and becomes 21st Street, crossing Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line as it heads into commercial areas. After crossing Main Street, the route is lined with homes before it crosses the Hokendauqua Creek into Allen Township and continues east. At this point, the name of the road becomes Nor-Bath Boulevard and it passes between a quarry and a lake to the north and industrial areas to the south before entering farmland. PA 329 briefly passes homes after the Howertown Road junction in the community of Howertown, crossing into East Allen Township at the Seemsville Road intersection and heading across Catasauqua Creek. The route continues through agricultural areas with some housing before reaching the PA 987 junction in Franks Corner. At this point, PA 987 forms a concurrency with PA 329, with the two routes continuing east through Jacksonville before turning northeast and passing to the east of a quarry. The road passes near a cement plant before it heads into the borough of Bath. Here, the road becomes Race Street and passes through woods before heading into residential areas. PA 329 reaches its eastern terminus at the PA 248 intersection, where PA 987 makes a turn east to follow PA 248.\n\nWhen Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 329 was legislated as part of Legislative Route 175 from east of Northampton to Bath. By 1926, the roadway between Northampton and Bath was paved. The present route between Cementon and Bath was designated as the eastern part of PA 145 in 1928. PA 329 was designated in 1928 to run from Egypt south to US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at 7th and Hamilton streets in Allentown. The route followed its current alignment east to Cementon, where it headed south on Coplay Road to Coplay and then continued along Mickley Pike through Whitehall Township before entering Allentown on 7th Street. In the 1930s, PA 329 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike (now MacArthur Road) through Whitehall Township. The Seventh Street Pike was built starting in the later part of the 1920s to provide a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township. The road between Allentown and Mickleys church was widened to three lanes in the 1930s. Also, the southern terminus was cut back to US 22, US 309, and PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown in the 1930s, with US 309/PA 29 replacing the route along 7th Street between Tilghman and Hamilton streets. In 1941, PA 329 was realigned to follow its current alignment between US 309 (now PA 873) in Neffs and PA 45 (now PA 248) and PA 987 in Bath, replacing the PA 145 designation between Cementon and Bath. PA 145 was realigned to follow the former alignment of PA 329 along Seventh Street Pike and 7th Street into Allentown. Another alignment designated PA 329 branched from the route in Balliettsville and headed southeast along Mauch Chunk Road and 18th Street to US 309/PA 29 and US 309 Byp. at the intersection of 19th Street and Main Boulevard on the northern edge of Allentown. By 1950, the branch of PA 329 from Balliettsville to Allentown was decommissioned.\n\nPennsylvania Route 329 Truck is a truck route of PA 329 around the weight-restricted bridge over the Lehigh River, on which trucks over 25 tons and combination loads over 30 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 145, US 22, and PA 987. It was signed in 2013.\n"}

Crystals are minute and capillary and rarely met with, the mineral occurring usually as soft earthy masses and encrustations. A fine apple-green color is its characteristic feature. It was long known (since 1758) under the name nickel bloom; the name annabergite was proposed by H. J. Brooke and W H. Miller in 1852, from Annaberg in Saxony, one of the localities of the mineral. It occurs with ores of nickel, of which it is a product of alteration. A variety, from Creetown in Kirkcudbrightshire, in which a portion of the nickel is replaced by calcium, has been called \"dudgeonite\", after P. Dudgeon, who found it.\n\nClosely related is \"cabrerite\" wherein some of the nickel is replaced by magnesium. It is named for Sierra Cabrera in Spain where it was originally found.\n"}

Released in 2005 by Columbia Records, it was originally distributed through an exclusive 18-month deal with Starbucks, after which it was released to the general retail market. The album release coincided with the release of the documentary \"No Direction Home: Bob Dylan\" (and accompanying 26-song soundtrack).\n\nThe performances documented on \"Live at The Gaslight 1962\" were recorded early in Dylan's career, during the hiatus between his first and second albums, when Dylan was still virtually unknown outside Greenwich Village. These performances occurred sometime in October 1962 at The Gaslight Cafe, self-proclaimed for hosting “the best entertainment in the Village.” The Gaslight was considered one of the premiere performance venues for the era’s new wave of folk singers, serving as a springboard for Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Dylan and others. Dylan’s performances were recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder patched into the house PA system and operated by sound engineer Richard Alderson, who would later handle the sound for Dylan’s 1966 tour. \n\nThese Gaslight recordings have circulated among Dylan collectors for many years. They made their first appearance on bootleg LPs no later than 1973\n, and have appeared, in various forms, on several bootleg LPs and CDs and on many Dylan fan CDR projects. The full set of recordings, including 17 tracks, is usually referred to by Dylan collectors as the \"Second Gaslight Tape\", but some refer to the recordings as a compilation of the \"Second\" and \"Third Gaslight Tape\", believing them to be compiled from two different sets at The Gaslight (noting differences in sound quality).\n\nTwo tracks from these recordings were previously released on official Dylan albums: \"No More Auction Block\" appeared on \"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991\" in 1991 and \"Handsome Molly\" appeared on the Japanese release \"\". A third track, \"The Cuckoo\", was one of six songs included on a promotional CD distributed in U.S. retail markets in association with the official release of Dylan's memoir, \"\" in 2004.\n\n\"Live at The Gaslight 1962\" captures early performances of three different Dylan compositions: \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" (often referred to as \"Hard Rain\"), \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\", and \"John Brown\". Both \"Hard Rain\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" would eventually appear on Dylan's second album, \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\",\" in May 1963. Around the same time, a studio version of \"John Brown\" was included on the Folkways Records compilation \"Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1\" in February 1963, but it would not be released on any of Dylan's subsequent studio albums (much later the song would re-appear as a live performance on Dylan's 1995 \"MTV Unplugged\" album.)\n\n\"Rocks and Gravel\", also credited as a Bob Dylan composition, is Dylan's own adaptation of Brownie McGhee's \"Solid Road\" and Leroy Carr's \"Alabama Woman\", an arrangement that fuses both songs into one. It was originally slated to appear on Dylan's second album (and later appeared on test pressings made for a preliminary version of the LP), but when Dylan reconfigured \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\", he omitted \"Rocks And Gravel\" from the final album sequence.\nThe remaining songs on \"Live at The Gaslight 1962\" show off the young Dylan’s already-broad knowledge of traditional folk songs. These include, among others, “The Cuckoo”, which was recorded as early as the 1920’s by western North Carolina banjo musician Clarence Ashley; “Moonshiner”, a traditional song that had also been performed by Irish folksters The Clancy Brothers (playing together with Pete Seeger) as well as by Appalachian folk singer Roscoe Holcomb; and “Barbara Allen” LINK, described by music historian Dave Marsh as “the most widespread folk song in the English language.”\n\nEven before the release of the official album, the recordings of the October 1962 cafe performances were well-reviewed. According to bobsboots.com, a website devoted to documenting Dylan bootlegs, the Gaslight recordings are considered “a ‘must have’ to any serious collection.” In preparation for the 2005 Columbia release, the recordings were re-engineered, rendering the songs “considerably clearer than their bootleg versions,” according to music critic WIlliam Ruhlmann, yet still retaining “their unofficial quality, with occasional flaws.” \"Entertainment Weekly’s\" David Browne gave the Columbia issue an A- grade, stating, “Gaslight is a spellbinding reminder that Dylan was never a typical folkie (or typical anything, for that matter.)” Sean Wilentz, who wrote the liner notes for the CD (and which he would much expand on in his 2010 book \"Dylan in America\"), notes that, “for all of its unpretentious, even impromptu qualities,” the Gaslight recordings show “how greatly and rapidly Dylan’s creativity was growing.” \n\nThe choice to release the Gaslight recordings initially through an exclusive deal with the corporate coffee giant Starbucks outraged some fans, who cited this as one more example of Dylan “selling out.” Many music retailers were upset as well, since Starbucks had exclusive rights to sell the release CD for 18 months. Large music retailer HMV Canada responded by pulling all Bob Dylan products off their shelves in protest. (HMV Canada had taken a similar stance with the Starbucks-exclusive release of Alanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\", removing all of the artist's catalog from their shelves.) Afterwards, in order to appease frustrated HMV customers, Columbia offered the \"Live at The Gaslight 1962\" CD as a free giveaway with any Bob Dylan purchase at HMV stores.\n\n"}

The route passes through rural areas, intersecting Interstate 78 (I-78)/U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Lenhartsville, PA 737 near Kempton, and PA 863 in Lynnport. What is now PA 143 north of Lenhartsville was originally designated Legislative Route 285 in 1911. PA 143 was designated to in 1928 to run from PA 43 in Lenhartsville to PA 29 near New Tripoli. The route was extended slightly east through New Tripoli by 1940 following a realignment of PA 29. PA 143 was extended south to PA 662 in 1962.\n\nPA 143 begins at an intersection with PA 662 in Richmond Township, Berks County, heading to the north on two-lane undivided Hard Hill Road. It turns northwest through a mix of hilly farms and woods with some homes, reaching the community of Virginville and becoming Main Street. In Virginville, the road crosses the Maiden Creek at the confluence with Sacony Creek into Perry Township, where it runs a short distance to the west of the Maiden Creek with woods to the east and farm fields to the west as an unnamed road. PA 143 continues through rural surroundings as it passes through Windsor Township and into Greenwich Township. The road enters more wooded surroundings and makes a few sharp turns prior to heading west into the borough of Lenhartsville. Here, the road becomes Chestnut Street and passes homes and businesses. The route intersects East Penn Street (Old Route 22) and heads west on East Penn Street for a short distance before turning north onto Willow Street.\n\nUpon leaving Lenhartsville for Greenwich Township again, PA 143 becomes unnamed and reaches an interchange with I-78/US 22. From this point, the road winds north through more forested areas, still running to the west of Maiden Creek. The route enters Albany Township and enters a mix of woods and farms as it comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 737 near the community of Kempton. Following this intersection, the road passes through more rural areas as it runs to the west of Ontelaunee Creek and the Wanamaker, Kempton and Southern Railroad.\nPA 143 crosses into Lynn Township in Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, and continues northeast to the community of Wanamakers as Kings Highway. At this point, the road turns more to the east and passes the terminus of the Wanamaker, Kempton and Southern Railroad as it heads into more agricultural areas with some homes. The route curves northeast and runs through the community of Jacksonville before it turns to the east. Upon reaching the community of Lynnport, PA 143 comes to the northern terminus of PA 863. From this intersection, the route continues farther east, curving southeast and crossing Ontelaunee Creek. PA 143 turns east and passes through New Tripoli as Decatur Street before reaching its northern terminus at PA 309.\nIn 2015, PA 143 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 2,700 vehicles between PA 863 and PA 309 to a low of 1,000 vehicles between PA 662 and I-78/US 22. None of PA 143 is part of the National Highway System.\n\nWhat is now PA 143 north of Lenhartsville was designated as part of Legislative Route 285, a legislative route that ran from Hamburg to New Tripoli, in 1911. PA 143 was designated in 1928 to follow its current alignment from PA 43 (now Old Route 22) in Lenhartsville northeast to PA 29 west of New Tripoli. The route was originally unpaved between Lenhartsville and Kempton while the section between Kempton and New Tripoli was paved. By 1940, PA 143 was paved between Lenhartsville and Kempton. Also by this time, PA 143 was extended through New Tripoli to end at PA 29 (now PA 309) to the east of the community following a realignment of PA 29. PA 143 was extended south from Lenhartsville to its current southern terminus at PA 662 on March 8, 1962.\n\n"}

Webb\n\nUlysses Sigel Webb (September 29, 1864 – July 31, 1947) was an American lawyer and politician affiliated with the Republican Party. He served as the 19th Attorney General of California for the lengthy span of 37 years.\n\nWebb's parents were Cyrus Webb, a Civil War captain, and Eliza Cather Webb. He was born in West Virginia and educated in Kansas, and later moved to Quincy, California. There, he gained admittance to the State Bar of California and was elected Plumas County District Attorney, in which position he served for 12 years (1890–1902).\n\nHe was appointed Attorney General of California by Governor Henry Gage in 1902, and elected to a full term later that year. Webb served as attorney general for 37 years, from 1902 to 1939 (9 terms), and is one of the longest-serving statewide officials in American history. He began a lengthy series of lawsuits to prove the state held title, in trust for the people of California, to tide and submerged lands, for public access and use for navigation, shipping and commerce. His administration served to clarify new legislation involving elections, motor vehicles, and criminal trial procedures. (The Criminal Law Division has since exploded its workload—Webb reported in his 1914–16 Biennial Report a criminal case load of 307 appeals in two years, whereas today more than 6,000 appeals are received annually).\n\nWebb also vigorously prosecuted land transfers made to avoid enforcement of the California Alien Land Law of 1913 that prohibited ownership of land in California by Chinese, Japanese, and other Asians who were ineligible for naturalized citizenship. In the 1930s, Webb's office pressured Fish and Game authorities to go after aliens with commercial fishermen's licenses and prevent offloading of fish at the port of San Diego.\n\nOn September 18, 1934, Judge C.N. Andrews ruled that residence requirements were a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Webb appealed to the Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court, both of which also ruled that residence requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nCalifornia governor Gray Davis apologized in 2003 for Webb's zealous progressive-promoted sterilization program under the state's eugenics policy.\n\nWebb married Grace Goodwin, the daughter of Judge J. D. and Martha Goodwin of Quincy. The Webbs had three children, Hester, Sigel Goodwin and Grace. Webb belonged to the Masonic and Knights of Pythias fraternities and to the Union League Club. He died in San Francisco on July 31, 1947.\n\n"}

The surname was and is often spelled Nordenfeldt, though Thorsten and his brothers always spelled it Nordenfelt, and the 1881 Census shows it as Nordenfelt. The family home in that year was Leinster Lodge on the Uxbridge Road, Paddington in west London.\n\nThorsten worked for a Swedish company in London from 1862 to 1866 and migrated to England in 1867 when he married Emma Stansfeld Grundy.\n\nThorsten Nordenfelt and his brother-in-law started a small business to trade Swedish steel for British rails in 1887. Later on he founded \"Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, ltd\" to develop a machine-gun designed by Helge Palmcrantz that would be referred to as the Nordenfelt gun. His company also designed a range of anti-torpedoboat guns in calibres from 37 to 57 mm, that were produced in Erith, Kent, Stockholm and Spain. Under pressure from Rothschild and Vickers his company merged with Maxim's in 1888 to form The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company.\n\nAfter a personal bankruptcy Nordenfelt was forced out of the Nordenfelt-Maxim company in 1890 and left England for France, where his new company, Société Nordenfelt, designed the eccentric screw breech used on the French 75. Legal action followed (\"Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd\") over a non-compete clause Nordenfelt had signed.\n\nIn 1903 he returned to Sweden and retired.\n\nIn 1902 a public house named after Thorsten Nordenfelt was built at 181 Erith Road, Erith just along from the Gun and Carriage works of Vickers, Sons and Maxim (previously Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company) . Named 'The Nordenfelt Tavern' it was built to the design of Jonathan G. Ensor (1852/3-19??), architect for brewer Watney Combe & Reid\n\nDiscussions between Thorsten Nordenfelt and the English reverend George Garrett led to the production of a series of steam-powered submarines. The first was the \"Nordenfelt I\", a 56-tonne, 19.5-metre long vessel similar to Garret's ill-fated \"Resurgam\" (1879), with a range of 240 kilometres and armed with a single torpedo and a 25.4 mm machine gun. It was manufactured by Bolinders in Stockholm in 1884–1885. Like the \"Resurgam\", it operated on the surface using a 100 HP steam engine with a maximum speed of 9 kn, then it shut down its engine to dive. She was purchased by the Greek Government and was delivered to Salamis Naval Base in 1886. Following the acceptance tests, she was never used again by the Hellenic Navy and was scrapped in 1901.\n\nNordenfelt then built the \"Nordenfelt II\" (\"Abdül Hamid\") in 1886 and \"Nordenfelt III\" (\"Abdül Mecid\") in 1887, a pair of 30-metre long submarines with twin torpedo tubes, for the Ottoman Navy. \"Abdül Hamid\" became the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo while submerged under water. Nordenfelt's efforts culminated in 1887 with the \"Nordenfelt IV\" which had twin motors and twin torpedoes. It was sold to the Russians, but proved unstable and ran aground off Jutland; when the Russians refused to pay for it, it was scrapped.\n\n\"Abdülhamid\" and \"Abdülmecid\" were in Istanbul in 1914. The submarines were briefly considered for use in harbour defence but it was found that their hulls were too badly corroded.\n"}

Located in Mundelein, Illinois, Carmel serves all of Lake County, as well as some of the surrounding counties, and southern Wisconsin. An institution of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, Carmel Catholic is one of three Carmelite-run high schools in the Chicago area, the others being Joliet Catholic High School and Mount Carmel High School.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Carmelites and the Sisters of Charity were asked to build separate but similar Catholic high schools for the northern part of the Archdiocese of Chicago; an area corresponding roughly to Lake County. The boys school opened in 1962, with the girls school opening the next year. Following a lengthy planning process, the decision was made by the Carmelites and the BVM Sisters to combine the two schools and establish a Board of Directors. This was done beginning in the 1988–89 school year.\n\nIn 1985, 1996, 2002, and 2007, Carmel Catholic High School was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education.\n\nThe school offers 20 Advanced Placement (AP) courses: Biology, Chemistry, , U.S. Government and Politics, U.S. History, European History, World History, English Language, English Literature, Spanish Language, French Language, Latin, Studio Art, Music Theory, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Statistics, Psychology, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics.\n\nThe demographic breakdown of the 1,318 students enrolled in 2015-16 was:\n\nCarmel's athletic teams are named Corsairs, and the school's colors are brown, gold, and white.

Fuqua\n\nJohn Brooks \"J.B.\" Fuqua (pronounced ) (June 26, 1918 – April 5, 2006) was a businessman, philanthropist and chairman of The Fuqua Companies and Fuqua Enterprises. The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University is named after him, as is the Fuqua School in Farmville, Virginia.\n\nJohn Brooks Elam Jr. was born on June 26, 1918 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, to John B. (November 15, 1890 - ) and Ruth Fuqua Elam (July 31, 1892 - September 7, 1918). His mother died two months after his birth; he was adopted by his maternal grandparents, who raised him on a small tobacco farm, and changed his last name to Fuqua. He graduated from Prospect high school, in Prospect, Virginia.\n\nFuqua formed a number of successful business conglomerates. After listening to WRVA from an early age, he pursued his interest in radio by earning his commercial operator's license at age 17.\n\nAs an adolescent, Fuqua educated himself by requesting books from the Duke University Library to be mailed to his farm. He credited Duke's lending program with enabling him to learn about business techniques.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1990s, Fuqua developed several businesses, such as Snapper lawnmower dealerships; multiple media outlets, including WJBF-TV, a TV station named for his initials, in Augusta, Georgia; real estate; insurance; banking; soft drink manufacturing; and auto finance, under the name Fuqua Industries.\n\nIn 1989 J.B. Fuqua retired as chairman from Fuqua Industries, selling stock he had in the company. In 1993, Fuqua paid $1 million to Fuqua Industries to remove his name from the company he had started, and was no longer connected to. His former company renamed itself to Actava Group, which later merged into Metromedia International.\n\nIn 1989, Fuqua acquired 35 percent of Vista Resources, renaming it Fuqua Enterprises in 1995. Fuqua and his son owned nearly 40 percent of the company’s common stock. He repeated what he did with his previous company acquiring different businesses this time in the areas such as the leather business and medical equipment.\n\nFuqua was active in politics for much of his life. On November 7, 1957 he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, to fill the unexpired term of Richard Lee Chambers III, who had resigned on October 10. This was during the period of the County Unit System in Georgia, so that Fuqua was one of three House members representing Richmond County. He was re-elected to two additional full terms in the House, before running for a seat in the State Senate. In 1962, Fuqua was elected to the Georgia Senate, taking office in January 1963, in a district previously represented by Carl Sanders. He served one term in the State Senate. From 1962 to 1966, Fuqua chaired the Democratic Party of Georgia. He was a close friend and supporter of presidents Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson, and former Savannah Mayor and billionaire Julius Curtis Lewis Jr..\n\nIn the 1970s, Fuqua demonstrated his considerable gratitude to Duke University by donating $10 million to its business school, which was subsequently renamed after him, becoming the Fuqua School of Business. His giving to the university totaled almost $40 million. He is an honorary alumnus of Duke.\n\nIn 1986, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Laws from Oglethorpe University.\n\nAnother of Fuqua's philanthropic projects was the Fuqua School in Farmville, Virginia, formerly the Prince Edward Academy. His gift of $10 million in 1993 and a subsequent donation of over $2 million were pledged with the goal of transforming the school from a small private institution on the verge of bankruptcy into a model for rural pre-K-12 education.\n\nIn February 1995, Fuqua donated $3 million to the Heart Center of Atlanta to honor his wife, Dorothy, on their 50th wedding anniversary. To recognize his generosity, the program was renamed the Fuqua Heart Center of Atlanta. In 1999, Mr. Fuqua contributed another $3 million to the Fuqua Heart Center to implement cardiac education programs for patients, their families, and the community, and in 2008 the J.B. Fuqua Trust awarded a $5 million bequest, which represented the largest estate gift to Piedmont Hospital in its 102-year history and demonstrated the Fuqua family's ongoing commitment both to the Fuqua heart center and to heart care at Piedmont Hospital. The bequest enables the Fuqua Heart Center to maintain the latest technology as advancements are made, and to support educational and scientific programs. Today the Fuqua Heart Center continues to provide superior cardiac care to patients on the Piedmont Hospital campus.\n\nIn 2002, Fuqua was inducted into the Junior Achievement's U.S. Business Hall of Fame. His great grandfather, John Fuqua, is credited with founding the town of Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina.\n\nJ.B. Fuqua died on April 5, 2006, in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 87.\n\n"}
{"id": "2176006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176006", "title": "Army Council (1647)", "text": "Army Council (1647)\n\nThe Army Council was a body established in 1647 to represent the views of all levels of the New Model Army. It originally consisted of senior commanders, like Sir Thomas Fairfax, and representatives elected by their regiments, known as Agitators. \n\nFollowing the Putney Debates of October to November 1647, Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton grew concerned by their radicalism, and in 1648, Agitators were removed from the Council. Now dominated by the so-called Grandees, it became the Council of Officers.\n\nWhen the First English Civil War began in 1642, the vast majority on both sides believed a 'well-ordered' monarchy was divinely mandated. They disagreed on what 'well-ordered' meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; Puritans believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations.\n\nHowever, 'Puritan' was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the Church of England, and contained many different perspectives. Presbyterians were the most prominent in the Long Parliament; in general, they wanted to convert the Church of England into a Presbyterian body, similar to the Church of Scotland. Independents opposed any state church, and although smaller in number, included Cromwell, as well as much of the New Model Army. \n\nHaving established control of Scotland in the 1639 to 1640 Bishops Wars, the Covenanters viewed the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant with Parliament as a way to preserve it, by preventing Royalist victory in England. As the war progressed, they and their English co-religionists came to see the Independents, and their political allies like the Levellers, as a greater threat to the established order than the Royalists. In 1646, many Parliamentarians assumed military defeat would force Charles I to agree terms, but this was a fundamental misunderstanding of his character. Charles refused to agree any substantial concessions, frustrating allies and opponents alike.\nHaving won the First English Civil War, the soldiers of the New Model Army (Army) became very discontented with the Long Parliament, for several reasons. Firstly, they had not been paid regularly and on the end of hostilities, the conservative MPs in Parliament wanted to either disband the Army or send them to fight in Ireland without receiving their back pay. Secondly, since most Parliamentarians wanted to restore the King without major democratic reforms or religious freedom, many soldiers asked why they had risked their lives in the first place – a sentiment that was strongly expressed by their elected representatives.\n\nTwo representatives, called Agitators, were elected from each regiment. The Agitators with two Army Officers from each regiment and the Generals formed a new body called the \"Army Council\" which after a rendezvous (meeting) near Newmarket on Friday 4 June 1647 issued \"\"A Solemne Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax\"\" to Parliament on 8 June making their concerns known and also the constitution of the Army Council so that Parliament would understand that the discontent was Army wide and had the support of officers and other ranks. This Engagement was read out to the Army at a general Army rendezvous on 5 June.\n\nHaving come under the influence of London radicals called the Levellers, the troops of the Army proposed a revolutionary new constitution named the Agreement of the People, which called for almost universal male suffrage, reform of electoral boundaries, power to rest with the Parliament which was to be elected every two years (not the King), religious freedom and an end to imprisonment for debt.\n\nIncreasingly concerned at the failure to pay their wages and by political maneuverings by King Charles I of England and by some in Parliament, the army marched slowly towards London over the next few months. In late October and early November at the Putney Debates the Army debated two different proposals. The first the \"Agreement of the People\" and the other \"The Heads of the Proposals\", put forward by Henry Ireton, (son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell) for the Army Council. It was a constitutional manifesto which included the preservation of property rights and maintaining the privileges of the gentry. At the Putney Debates it was agreed to hold three further rendezvous.\n\nAfter the Putney Debates the Army commanders Sir Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell were worried at the strength of support which the Levellers had in the Army. So they decided to impose \"The Heads of the Proposals\" as the army's manifesto instead of the Levellers' \"Agreement of the People\"\n\nTo do this they demanded that every soldier sign a declaration of loyalty, to Fairfax the commander-in-chief and the Army Council, which signified that they accepted \"The Heads of the Proposals\" as the Army's manifesto. Many of the men were willing to sign, even if they had Leveller sympathies, because Cromwell and Fairfax promised that Parliament would pay them the back pay which they were owed. But if they did not sign, it was suggested, then the army could not present a united front to Parliament and payment could be delayed and that some regiments might be disbanded with no back pay at all. The declaration was a politically astute move because the soldiers were now bound to the Army Council and not the King or Parliament.\n\nAt the first rendezvous was the Corkbush Field rendezvous, the senior officers in the army known as the Grandees gained the agreement of most regiments to accept the Army Council's \"The Heads of the Proposals\" instead of the \"Agreement of the People\" as the Army's manifesto. A mutiny by a minority of regiments was suppressed by Cromwell who had Private Richard Arnold, tried for mutiny and shot on the spot as an example. At the two other rendezvous at Ruislip Heath and Kingston the other regiments were ordered to show support for Fairfax which they all agreed to do.\n\nOver the following years the Army Council changed in constituency. The elected agitators were removed and the Council became an (Army) Council of Officers, remaining an important institution in the ruling establishment of the English Commonwealth and the Protectorate during the Interregnum. For example, at the start of the Protectorate, ten days after the dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20 April 1653, Cromwell told the Council of State that it no longer existed and together with the Council of Officers, instituted a new Council of State.\n\n"}

Since beginning her career in 1966, Hawkins has won two Grammy Awards, two Doves, and 19 Stellar Awards.\n\nHawkins was born in San Francisco, California to Roland and Lois (Cleveland) Davis. She grew up in the Ephesians Church of God in Christ located in Berkeley, California, pastored by her grandfather, the late Bishop E.E. Cleveland. \n\nWhile still in high school, Hawkins and her friends, Mary McCreary, Elva Mouton, and Vet Stone, had a gospel group called the Heavenly Tones that performed at various venues around the Oakland and San Francisco areas. In 1966 the group recorded the album \"I Love the Lord\" for the Gospel label, part of Savoy Records, and a 45 for the Music City label called \"He's Alright\". When Stone's older brother Sylvester, better known as Sly Stone, formed Sly & the Family Stone with their brother Freddie and friends Larry Graham, Cynthia Robinson, Jerry Martini, and Greg Errico, the Heavenly Tones were recruited directly out of high school to become Little Sister, Sly & the Family Stone's background vocalists for their recording. Hawkins left the group to focus solely on recording and singing gospel music. \n\nAt the age of 17, Hawkins sang on the Edwin Hawkins Singers Choir's single \"Oh Happy Day\". With her distinctive soprano and extensive vocal range, she became better known as a featured soloist with late husband Walter Hawkins' Love Center Choir as well as the Hawkins Family. Hawkins scored several hits as a solo artist in the 1980s while signed to Light Records, and released now-classic albums, such as her 1979 self-titled debut, \"Tramaine\", and its 1983 follow-up \"Determined\". Songs such as \"Changed,\" \"Goin Up Yonder\", \"He's That Kind Of Friend\", Jesus Christ Is The Way\" and \"Highway\" quickly became staples and fan favorites.\n\nHawkins was briefly a member of the 1970s R&B/soul vocal group Honey Cone. The group recorded the R&B hit \"Want Ads\" which made its way back into the gospel genre by being sampled on Mary Mary's 2005 hit \"Heaven\". Hawkins also briefly sang with Andrae Crouch and The Disciples, singing lead on their 1970 release \"Christian People.\" Hawkins is both famous and infamous for her mainstream success as a gospel artist. In the mid-1980s, she signed with A&M Records and released a pair of dance-oriented contemporary gospel albums. Her 1985 A&M debut \"The Search Is Over\" yielded dance chart singles such as \"Child of the King,\" \"In the Morning Time,\" and the monster club hit \"Fall Down (Spirit of Love)\". The latter topped the \"Billboard\" Dance Charts to A&M's delight.\n\nHowever, Hawkins was somewhat ostracized by her core gospel music audience, who were soured by her music's lyrically neutral content and the heavy mainstream attention it received. Though \"Fall Down\" became one of the earliest gospel songs to crossover to mainstream charts, traditional fans balked. Nonetheless, \"Freedom\" followed in 1987, producing \"The Rock\" and its title track as singles. The latter was co-written and produced by The Jacksons. Nearly 15 years later, \"Fall Down\" received a resurgence of popularity as gospel singer Kelli Williams recorded a remake of the hit as \"Fall Down 2000\", produced by avant garde gospel artist Tonéx. Though the song had not been widely acknowledged in the gospel music community, the more than eight-minute extended dance mix was finally included on Hawkins's 2001 collection \"All My Best To You, Vol. 2\". In the new millennium, Hawkins resurfaced on GospoCentric Records with a powerful release, \"Still Tramaine\". This album included traditional gospel songs along with a duet with ex-husband, the late Walter Hawkins, on \"It's Your Power\". Also included on \"Still Tramaine\" was a track titled \"Over There\", an uptempo track reminiscent of \"Fall Down\". \n\nHawkins won her first Grammy Award in 1981 for her participation performance on \"The Lord's Prayer\", along with her then-husband Walter Hawkins.\n\nFollowing harsh criticism and backlash from the success of her A&M recordings, Hawkins signed with Sparrow and delivered 1988's \"The Joy That Floods My Soul\", including the opener \"All Things Are Possible.\" The stellar set quickly re-endeared Hawkins to her core audience. Between album releases, Hawkins made a cameo on MC Hammer's 1990 pop-gospel hit \"Do Not Pass Me By\". She was also honored with a request to sing at the funeral of Sammy Davis, Jr. when the beloved entertainment legend died in May 1990. She was also a guest lead vocalist on Santana's June 1990 album \"Spirits Dancing in the Flesh\".\n\nThough \"Joy That Floods\" was well received, that studio effort was eclipsed by the release of the concert recording \"Tramaine Hawkins Live\" in 1990. The grandiose recording with its sweeping arrangements and show-stopping medleys of fan favorites would become a benchmark in Hawkins' career. The set eventually vindicated Hawkins in total by winning a much-coveted Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album in 1991. Following her triumphant comeback, she became one of the first gospel artists to sign with Columbia Records when she released \"To A Higher Place\" in 1994. \n\nFollowing this album's release, Hawkins took an extended hiatus from recording. New music would not surface until Hawkins' 2000 cameo appearance on gospel trio 's recorded cover of her signature tune \"Highway\". Following this foreshadowing, Hawkins delivered the tour-de-force studio recording \"Still Tramaine\" in 2001 after signing a new contract with GospoCentric Records. The album would also give a nod to her former career as a dance-floor darling featuring Basement Boys club remixes of the single \"By His Strength\".\n\nHawkins again paid final tribute to an African-American legend when she was requested in 2005 to sing at the funeral service of civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Hawkins was also part of the Rosa Parks tribute recording \"Something Inside So Strong\" from \"A Celebration of Quiet Strength\", featuring other gospel artists such as Vanessa Bell Armstrong and Daryl Coley. \n\nHawkins was inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame. She received the James Cleveland Lifetime Achievement Award, and won two Stellar Awards for Female Vocalist of the Year and Traditional Female of the Year for her 2007 CD release \"I Never Lost My Praise\" (2007). \n\nAfter the release of her second live album, \"I Never Lost My Praise\", Hawkins embarked on a church tour across the United States. Lady Tramaine was the special guest along with Bishop Walter Hawkins, Bishop Rance Allen, Pastor Daryl Coley, Pastor Andrae' Crouch, Dorinda Clark-Cole, Karen Clark-Sheard and Joe Ligon of the Mighty Clouds of Joy on the Mary Mary project, singing \"It Will Be Worth It\". \n\nShe also returned to Bobby Jones Gospel in 2012 to perform \"I Never Lost My Praise\". In 2014, Hawkins joined fellow gospel star Donnie McClurkin on his album \"Duets\", appearing on the track \"My Past\".\n\nWhile married to Walter Hawkins from 1971 until 1994 (23 years), the couple had two children, a son, Walter \"Jamie\" Hawkins and a daughter, Trystan Hawkins, with four granddaughters and three grandsons.

The main evidence is from altars dedicated to the god by Roman soldiers. \n\nAccording to J.T. Koch at the University of Wales, the various alternations of the name \"Moguns\" derive from the Romano-Celtic dialectal reflexes of Proto-Celtic *\"mogont-s\" (a derivative of the Proto-Indo-European root \"*megH2-\" \"to be great, mighty\"), an Indo-European *\"-nt-\" -stem cognate with Sanskrit \"mahānt\" and Avestan \"mazant\" ‘great’.\n\nAltar-stones raised to Mogons have been recovered in the United Kingdom, such as the stones found at the following locations.

The inscription at Habitancum identifies the troops stationed at that location as being from the Vangiones, the Gaesati and Rhaetia; i.e., from Germania Superior. Mainz was in the territory of the Aresaces, a celtic tribe probably part of the Treveri.\n\nThe Habitancum inscription contains also the expression \"Deo Mogonito Cad...\" with the letters following \"Cad\" missing. As the region is in the territory of the historic Scottish tribe called the \"Gadeni\", centered around Jedburgh (Jed possibly from Cad), the Cad.. is interpreted as some case of Cadeni. One speculation is that the Cadeni were a section of the Vangiones. Some derive Cadeni from Gaedhal, or Gael. A third theory derives Cad from catu-, \"battle\", with a sense \"to the battle god, Mogon...\".\n\nConsidering that the gods worshipped in the future Alsace, then home of the Vangiones, were Celtic, such as Grannus, Moguns is currently taken to be Celtic. The -uns is a specifically Celtic suffix. As for the historic Gadeni, their origin is not known. They could be the remnants of the Vangiones or possibly among the indigenes. Perhaps the future discovery of additional inscriptions or the future publication of inscriptions already known but unpublished will shed further light on Mogons.\n\n"}

It was first opened to the public on 9 May 1992 and is located in a 1671 Dutch Warehouse above the Old Gate of Galle Fort. Whilst the building housing the museum survived the impact of the 26 December 2004 tsunami, the adjoining UNESCO Maritime Archaeology Unit was completely destroyed and all the exhibitions were flood damaged and the majority of maritime archeological artifacts were lost. Under Sri Lanka – Netherlands Cultural Co-operation Program, the Royal Government of Netherlands provided financial assistance for reconstruction of the Maritime Museum. After 3 years period of reconstruction, the Maritime Museum was re-opened to the public.\n\nThe Dutch Warehouse building constructed during the latter part of the seventeenth century has, unlike in most other Dutch fortifications, a part of the building embodied into the thickness of the rampart. It is a two storey long building, and the original entry to the fort, bisects the ground floor. Above the Old Gate the British Coat of Arms is seen inscribed at the entrance, the inner part of the gate has an inscription, with the date, 1668, the letters VOC, (an abbreviation of Verenigde Oostindindische Compagnie (the Dutch East India Company)), and the insignia of a cock flanked by two lions. When the new gateway (the main or northern gate) was built by the British in 1873, piercing the main rampart between the Sun and Moon Bastions, the importance of the old gate was reduced, although it continued to be used as the main entrance to the harbour and port of Galle. During its history spanning well over three centuries, the functions of the Warehouse were many and varied. In post-independent Sri Lanka it was used as an administrative office complex until these offices were shifted to the new secretariat building outside Galle Fort. The building was subsequently reduced to a derelict building due to long years of negligence, lack of maintenance and natural decay.\n\nPortion of the building was then used to house the National Maritime Museum which was opened to the public on 9 May 1992. The National Maritime Museum originally specialised in the fauna and flora of the sea. Artifacts consisted of underwater artifacts and scaled-down models of whales and fish. The museum displayed a variety of exhibits connected with sea-faring, maritime trade, fishing and sea-life, including relics retrieved from the 20-odd maritime archaeological sites around Galle.\n\nOther exhibits included life-size dioramas of the traditional methods of fishing and the \"walk into the sea\" diorama, showing the natural coral beds, sea grass beds and deep sea fish. One of the final exhibits of the museum was a display of the causes of sea pollution, coast erosion, and the methods used to combat these problems.\n\nThe museum suffered significant damage from the 2004 Asian tsunami, with only an estimated 20% of the 3,600 objects salvaged from shipwrecks within the waters of Galle port remaining. The tsunami caused the demolition of the UNESCO Archaeological Marine Unit, a joint Sri Lankan/Dutch Project, which was located on one of the old jetties just outside the northern gate of Galle Fort. The water entered the Town from the northern gate and flooded the premises of the former Maritime Museum, (up to a height of 2.2 metres), which was closed for renovations at the time of the tsunami.\n\nThe Dutch warehouse building at the fort, built in 1717, was renovated and was planned to house the museum at the end of 2008.\n\nOn 4 March 2010, it was reopened as the country's first National Maritime Archaeology Museum. The original Dutch warehouse building was fully renovated under a special grant of Rs. 177 million from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The new museum has dual access, with the upper level entry linked with the present main gate, while the lower level access has reinstated the position of building as the prominent gateway. This has also made the building accessible for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.\n\nExhibits of marine artifacts found in underwater explorations are showcased in the Museum. There are maps, naval craft, ropes, earthenware, beer mugs, smoking pipes, barrels, vast numbers of articles including artillery guns and sailor shoes. Ship wrecks in the sea off the Southern coast is where these artifacts were recovered from, some of which are nearly 800 years old.\n\n"}

It is found in temperate areas throughout the world.\n\nMost giant puffballs grow to be , sometimes to be in diameter; although occasionally some can reach diameters up to and weights of . The inside of mature Giant puffballs is greenish brown, whereas the interior of immature puffballs is white. The large white mushrooms are edible when young.\n\nThe fruiting body of a puffball mushroom will develop within the period of a few weeks and soon begin to decompose and rot, at which point it is dangerous to eat. Unlike most mushrooms, all the spores of the giant puffball are created inside the fruiting body; large specimens can easily contain several trillion spores. Spores are yellowish, smooth, and in size.\n\nThe classification of this species has been revised in recent years, as the formerly recognized class Gasteromycetes, which included all puffballs, has been found to be polyphyletic. Some authors place the giant puffball and other members of genus \"Calvatia\" in order Agaricales. Also, the species has in the past been placed in two other genera, \"Lycoperdon\" and \"Langermannia\". However, the current view is that the Giant Puffball is \"Calvatia\".\n\n\"Widespread and fairly common, and not considered of conservation concern in the UK.

Immature gilled species still contained within their universal veil can be look alikes for puffballs. To distinguish puffballs from poisonous fungi, they must be cut open; edible puffballs will have a solid white interior. Some similar mushrooms have the white interior (or yellowish) but also have the silhouette of a cap-type mushroom on the interior when cut open. These are young cap-type mushrooms and may be poisonous.\n\nPuffballs are a known styptic and have long been used as wound dressing, either in powdered form or as slices 3 cm thick. The fungus was often harvested prior to battles for this purpose.\n\nIt is the main source of the anti-tumor mucoprotein calvacin, which is present only in tiny quantities.\n\nGiant puffballs resemble the earthball (\"Scleroderma citrinum\"). The latter are distinguished by a much firmer, elastic fruiting body, and having an interior that becomes dark purplish-black with white reticulation early in development. Scleroderma citrinum are poisonous and may cause mild intoxications.\n\n\n"}

Although not originally intended for trending, HEDIS results are increasingly used to track year-to-year performance. HEDIS is one component of NCQA's accreditation process, although some plans submit HEDIS data without seeking accreditation. An incentive for many health plans to collect HEDIS data is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirement that health maintenance organizations (HMOs) submit Medicare HEDIS data in order to provide HMO services for Medicare enrollees under a program called .\n\nHEDIS was originally titled the \"HMO Employer Data and Information Set\" as of version 1.0 of 1991. In 1993, Version 2.0 of HEDIS was known as the \"Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set\". Version 3.0 of HEDIS was released in 1997. In July 2007, NCQA announced that the meaning of \"HEDIS\" would be changed to \"Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set.\"\n\nIn current usage, the \"reporting year\" after the term \"HEDIS\" is one year following the year reflected in the data; for example, the \"HEDIS 2009\" reports, available in June 2009, contain analyses of data collected from \"measurement year\" January–December 2008.\n\nThe 90 HEDIS measures are divided into six \"domains of care\": \n\nMeasures are added, deleted, and revised annually. For example, a measure for the length of stay after giving birth was deleted after legislation mandating minimum length of stay rendered this measure nearly useless. Increased attention to medical care for seniors prompted the addition of measures related to glaucoma screening and osteoporosis treatment for older adults. Other health care concerns covered by HEDIS are immunizations, cancer screenings, treatment after heart attacks, diabetes, asthma, flu shots, access to services, dental care, alcohol and drug dependence treatment, timeliness of handling phone calls, prenatal and postpartum care, mental health care, well-care or preventive visits, inpatient utilization, drug utilization, and distribution of members by age, sex, and product lines.\n\nNew measures in HEDIS 2013 are “Asthma Medication Ratio,” “Diabetes Screening for People With Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications,” “Diabetes Monitoring for People With Diabetes and Schizophrenia,” “Cardiovascular Monitoring for People With Cardiovascular Disease and Schizophrenia,” and “Adherence to Antipsychotic Medications for Individuals With Schizophrenia.”\n\nMost HEDIS data is collected through surveys, medical charts and insurance claims for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. Survey measures must be conducted by an NCQA-approved external survey organization. Clinical measures use the administrative or hybrid data collection methodology, as specified by NCQA. Administrative data are electronic records of services, including insurance claims and registration systems from hospitals, clinics, medical offices, pharmacies and labs. For example, a measure titled Childhood Immunization Status requires health plans to identify 2-year-old children who have been enrolled for at least a year. The plans report the percentage of children who received specified immunizations. Plans may collect data for this measure by reviewing insurance claims or automated immunization records, but this method will not include immunizations received at community clinics that do not submit insurance claims. For this measure, plans are allowed to select a random sample of the population and supplement claims data with data from medical records. By doing so, plans may identify additional immunizations and report more favorable and accurate rates. However, the hybrid method is more costly, time-consuming and requires nurses or medical record reviewers who are authorized to review confidential medical records.\n\nAs of 2019, NCQA is transitioning data collection to a digital process that uses existing electronic data sources rather than surveys and manual data collection. The first six measures available for HEDIS Electronic Clinical Data System (ECDS) reporting include some related to depression, unhealthy alcohol use, and immunization status.\n\nHEDIS results must be audited by an NCQA-approved auditing firm for public reporting. NCQA has an on-line reporting tool called Quality Compass that is available for a fee of several thousand dollars. It provides detailed data on all measures and is intended for employers, consultants and insurance brokers who purchase health insurance for groups. NCQA's web site includes a summary of HEDIS results by health plan. NCQA also collaborates annually with U.S. News & World Report to rank HMOs using an index that combines many HEDIS measures and accreditation status. The \"Best Health Plans\" list is published in the magazine in October and is available on the magazine's web site. Other local business organizations, governmental agencies and media report HEDIS results, usually when they are released in the fall.\n\nProponents cite the following advantages of HEDIS measures:\n\n\nHEDIS was described in 1995 as \"very controversial\".

The album features arrangements by Davis and collaborator Gil Evans from George Gershwin's 1935 opera of the same name. The album was recorded in four sessions on July 22, July 29, August 4, and August 18, 1958, at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City. It is the second collaboration between Davis and Evans and has garnered much critical acclaim since its release, being acknowledged by some music critics as the best of their collaborations. Jazz critics have regarded the album as historic.\n\nIn 1958, Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, seeing its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity. Five years earlier, in 1953, pianist George Russell published his \"Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization\", which offered an alternative to the practice of improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using scales or a series of scales for improvisations. His approach to improvisation came to be known as modal in jazz. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled \"thick\". Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis put it, \"a return to melody\". In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of \"The Jazz Review\", Davis remarked on the modal approach:\n\nIn early 1958, Davis began using this approach with his sextet. Influenced by Russell's ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of his 1958 album \"Milestones\", which was based on two modes, recorded in April of that year. Instead of soloing in the straight, conventional, melodic way, Davis’s new style of improvisation featured rapid mode and scale changes played against sparse chord changes. Davis' second collaboration with Gil Evans on \"Porgy and Bess\" gave him more room for experimentation with Russell's concept and with third stream playing, as Evans' compositions for Davis featured this modal approach.\n\nThe musical, commercial and critical success of 1957's \"Miles Ahead\" helped make future Davis/Evans ventures possible, as it impressed Columbia Records enough for them to bestow further artistic control upon Davis and Evans. At that period, Davis' girlfriend Frances Taylor was in the New York City Center's production of the George Gershwin/DuBose Heyward/Ira Gershwin opera \"Porgy and Bess\", and the Samuel Goldwyn film adaptation was in production, set for release in June 1959. The advance publicity for the film was considerable, and with the late-1950s vogue for recorded \"jazz versions of...\", a number of \"Porgy and Bess\" jazz interpretations were released. These ranged from an all-star big band version arranged and conducted by Bill Potts to one by Bob Crosby and the Bobcats. Following the first collaboration with Evans, Davis followed up on these efforts with much interest in symphonic readings, which, at the time, jazzmen were not known for, and neither were some classically trained musicians known for interpreting jazz scores. Nevertheless, Davis enlisted members of his sextet, including Cannonball Adderley and Paul Chambers.\n\nThe second in a series of Davis/Evans collaborations, \"Porgy and Bess\" was well received upon its release by music critics and publications, including \"The New York Times\" and \"Los Angeles Times\". Music writer Bill Kirchner wrote \"In this century's American music, three partnerships have been most influential: Duke Ellington/Billy Strayhorn, Frank Sinatra/Nelson Riddle, and Miles Davis/Gil Evans.\" As one of Davis' best-selling albums, \"Porgy and Bess\" has earned recognition as a landmark album in orchestral jazz. Davis biographer Jack Chambers described the album as \"a new score, with its own integrity, order and action.\" The album's appeal was more widespread among critics following its reissue in 1997. Robert Gilbert of \"All About Jazz\" praised \"Porgy and Bess\", describing it as \"one of many great albums that Miles Davis recorded over his lifetime. It reaches a higher plateau than most, though, in its way that it can reach the listener on both a musical and emotional level. That the album is still able to do this after almost forty-five years is a testament to the rare magic that occurred in a New York studio over four days in the summer of 1958.\"\n\nIn August 1997, \"JazzTimes\" magazine called \"Porgy and Bess\" \"possibly the best of the collaborations between Miles and Gil Evans ... Evans is justly regarded as the master of modern orchestration and \"Porgy and Bess\" shows him at his best.\" The album was included in Elvis Costello's \"500 Albums You Need\" (\"Vanity Fair\", Issue No. 483 11/00) and was ranked No. 785 on the \"Virgin\" \"All-Time Top 1000 Album\" list.\n\nAll compositions written by George Gershwin, except otherwise noted.

Numbers increase by one as customers enter the store. A global counter displays the number of the customer that is currently being served. All other customers must wait in a queue until the baker finishes serving the current customer and the next number is displayed. When the customer is done shopping and has disposed of his or her number, the clerk increments the number, allowing the next customer to be served. That customer must draw another number from the numbering machine in order to shop again.\n\nAccording to the analogy, the \"customers\" are threads, identified by the letter \"i\", obtained from a global variable.\n\nDue to the limitations of computer architecture, some parts of Lamport's analogy need slight modification. It is possible that more than one thread will get the same number \"n\" when they request it; this cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is assumed that the thread identifier \"i\" is also a priority. A lower value of \"i\" means a higher priority and threads with higher priority will enter the critical section first.\n\nThe critical section is that part of code that requires exclusive access to resources and may only be executed by one thread at a time. In the bakery analogy, it is when the customer trades with the baker that others must wait.\n\nWhen a thread wants to enter the critical section, it has to check whether now is its turn to do so. It should check the number \"n\" of every other thread to make sure that it has the smallest one. In case another thread has the same number, the thread with the smallest \"i\" will enter the critical section first.\n\nIn pseudocode this comparison between threads \"a\" and \"b\" can be written in the form:\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\nOnce the thread ends its critical job, it gets rid of its number and enters the non-critical section.\n\nThe non-critical section is the part of code that doesn't need exclusive access. It represents some thread-specific computation that doesn't interfere with other threads' resources and execution.\n\nThis part is analogous to actions that occur after shopping, such as putting change back into the wallet.\n\nIn Lamport's original paper, the \"entering\" variable is known as \"choosing\", and the following conditions apply:\n\nIn this example, all threads execute the same \"main\" function, \"Thread\".\nIn real applications, different threads often have different \"main\" functions.\n\nNote that as in the original paper, the thread checks itself before entering the critical section.\nSince the loop conditions will evaluate as \"false\", this does not cause much delay.\n\nWe declare N to be the number of processes, and we assume that N is a natural number.\nCONSTANT N\nASSUME N \\in Nat\nWe define P to be the set {1, 2, ... , N} of processes.\n\nP == 1..N \nThe variables num and flag are declared as global.\n--algorithm AtomicBakery {\nvariable num = [i \\in P |-> 0], flag = [i \\in P |-> FALSE];\nThe following defines to be true iff is less than or equal to in the usual lexicographical ordering. \n\ndefine { LL(j, i) == \\/ num[j] < num[i]\n\nFor each element in P there is a process with local variables unread, max and nxt. Steps between consecutive labels p1, ..., p7, cs are considered atomic. The statement with sets id to a nondeterministically chosen element of the set S and then executes body. A step containing the statement await expr can be executed only when the value of expr is .\nprocess (p \\in P)\np1: while (TRUE) {\np2: while (unread # {}) {\np3: num[self] := max + 1;\np4: flag[self] := FALSE;\np5: while (unread # {}) {\np6: await \\/ num[nxt] = 0\ncs: skip ; \\* the critical section;\np7: num[self] := 0;\n\nWe use the AtomicIntegerArray class not for its built in atomic operations but because its get and set methods work like volatile reads and writes. Under the Java Memory Model this ensures that writes are immediately visible to all threads.\nAtomicIntegerArray ticket = new AtomicIntegerArray(threads); // ticket for threads in line, n - number of threads\n// Java initializes each element of 'ticket' to 0\nAtomicIntegerArray entering = new AtomicIntegerArray(threads); // 1 when thread entering in line\n// Java initializes each element of 'entering' to 0\npublic void lock(int pid) // thread ID\n\npublic void unlock(int pid)\n\nEach thread only writes its own storage, only reads are shared. It is remarkable that this algorithm is not built on top of some lower level \"atomic\" operation, e.g. compare-and-swap. The original proof shows that for overlapping reads and writes to the same storage cell only the write must be correct. The read operation can return an arbitrary number.\nTherefore this algorithm can be used to implement mutual exclusion on memory that lacks synchronisation primitives, e.g., a simple SCSI disk shared between two computers.\n\nThe necessity of the variable \"Entering\" might not be obvious as there is no 'lock' around lines 7 to 13. However, suppose the variable was removed and two processes computed the same codice_1. If the higher-priority process was preempted before setting codice_1, the low-priority process will see that the other process has a number of zero, and enters the critical section; later, the high-priority process will ignore equal codice_1 for lower-priority processes, and also enters the critical section. As a result, two processes can enter the critical section at the same time. The bakery algorithm uses the \"Entering\" variable to make the assignment on line 6 look like it was atomic; process \"i\" will never see a number equal to zero for a process \"j\" that is going to pick the same number as \"i\".\n\nWhen implementing the pseudo code in a single process system or under cooperative multitasking, it is better to replace the \"do nothing\" sections with code that notifies the operating system to immediately switch to the next thread. This primitive is often referred to as codice_4.\n\nLamport's bakery algorithm assumes a sequential consistency memory model. Few, if any, languages or multi-core processors implement such a memory model. Therefore correct implementation of the algorithm typically requires inserting fences to inhibit reordering.\n\n\n"}

The building has been used for many different purposes over the years. It was a teacher training college and an institute for the instruction of clergymen between 1696 and 1796. At one time it was the residence of Colonel Count August Carl Fredrick Von Ranzow (1759 - 1844). It operated as an orphanage under the supervision of the deacons and financed by the Dutch East Indies Company. It was also used as a hospital. It became a barracks in the second half of the 1800s and in 1900 it was used as a police training school, set up by the British. In 1932 it was converted to the Pettah Post Office. In 1971 following heavy monsoon rains one of the exterior walls collapsed and the building was abandoned. Following protests by the Royal Asiatic Society and the Dutch Burgher Union against plans to demolish the building, in 1973 a committee was established with representatives from the Ceylon Tourist Board, the Department of Archaeology, the Netherlands Alumni Association of Lanka and the National Archives, to restore the building and establish a museum covering the Dutch colonial period.\n\nThe restoration of the building commenced in 1977, with financial assistance of Netherlands government, and was completed in 1981. This museum was opened to the public in 1982. This building embodies the unique architectural features of a colonial Dutch town house.

{"id": "2176091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176091", "title": "Gaseous ionization detector", "text": "Gaseous ionization detector\n\nGaseous ionization detectors are radiation detection instruments used in particle physics to detect the presence of ionizing particles, and in radiation protection applications to measure ionizing radiation.\n\nThey use the ionising effect of radiation upon a gas-filled sensor. If a particle has enough energy to ionize a gas atom or molecule, the resulting electrons and ions cause a current flow which can be measured.\n\nGaseous ionisation detectors form an important group of instruments used for radiation detection and measurement. This article gives a quick overview of the principal types, and more detailed information can be found in the articles on each instrument. The accompanying plot shows the variation of ion pair generation with varying applied voltage for constant incident radiation. There are three main practical operating regions, one of which each type utilises.\n\nThe three basic types of gaseous ionization detectors are 1) ionization chambers, 2) proportional counters, and 3) Geiger-Müller tubes\n\nAll of these have the same basic design of two electrodes separated by air or a special fill gas, but each uses a different method to measure the total number of ion-pairs that are collected. The strength of the electric field between the electrodes and the type and pressure of the fill gas determines the detector's response to ionizing radiation.\n\nIonization chambers operate at a low electric field strength, selected such that no gas multiplication takes place. The ion current is generated by the creation of \"ion pairs\", consisting of an ion and an electron. The ions drift to the cathode while free electrons drift to the anode under the influence of the electric field. This current is independent of the applied voltage if the device is being operated in the \"ion chamber region\". Ion chambers are preferred for high radiation dose rates because they have no \"dead time\"; a phenomenon which affects the accuracy of the Geiger Muller tube at high dose rates.\n\nThe advantages are good uniform response to gamma radiation and accurate overall dose reading, capable of measuring very high radiation rates, sustained high radiation levels do not degrade the fill gas.\n\nThe disadvantages are 1) low output requiring sophisticated electrometer circuit and 2) operation and accuracy easily affected by moisture.\n\nProportional counters operate at a slightly higher voltage, selected such that discrete avalanches are generated. Each ion pair produces a single avalanche so that an output current pulse is generated which is proportional to the energy deposited by the radiation. This is in the \"proportional counting\" region. \nThe term \"gas proportional detector\" (GPD) is generally used in radiometric practice, and the property of being able to detect particle energy is particularly useful when using large area flat arrays for alpha and beta particle detection and discrimination, such as in installed personnel monitoring equipment. \n\nThe wire chamber is a multi-electrode form of proportional counter used as a research tool.\n\nThe advantages are the ability to measure energy of radiation and provide spectrographic information, discriminate between alpha and beta particles, and that large area detectors can be constructed\n\nThe disadvantages are that anode wires are delicate and can lose efficiency in gas flow detectors due to deposition, the efficiency and operation affected by ingress of oxygen into fill gas, and measurement windows easily damaged in large area detectors.\n\nMicropattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are high granularity gaseous detectors with sub-millimeter distances between the anode and cathode electrodes. The main advantages of these microelectronic structures over traditional wire chambers include: count rate capability, time and position resolution, granularity, stability and radiation hardness . Examples of MPGDs are the microstrip gas chamber, the gas electron multiplier and the micromegas detector.\n\nGeiger-Müller tubes are the primary components of Geiger counters. They operate at an even higher voltage, selected such that each ion pair creates an avalanche, but by the emission of UV photons, multiple avalanches are created which spread along the anode wire, and the adjacent gas volume ionizes from as little as a single ion pair event. This is the \"Geiger region\" of operation. The current pulses produced by the ionising events are passed to processing electronics which can derive a visual display of count rate or radiation dose, and usually in the case of hand-held instruments, an audio device producing clicks.\n\nThe advantages are that they are a cheap and robust detector with a large variety of sizes and applications, large output signal is produced from tube which requires minimal electronic processing for simple counting, and it can measure the overall gamma dose when using an energy compensated tube.\n\nThe disadvantages are that it cannot measure the energy of the radiation (no spectrographic information), it will not measure high radiation rates due to dead time, and sustained high radiation levels will degrade fill gas.\n\nThe UK Health and Safety Executive has issued a guidance note on the correct portable instrument for the application concerned. This covers all radiation instrument technologies and is useful in selecting the correct gaseous ionisation detector technology for a measurement application.\n\nIonization-type smoke detectors are gaseous ionization detectors in widespread use. A small source of radioactive americium is placed so that it maintains a current between two plates that effectively form an ionisation chamber. If smoke gets between the plates where ionization is taking place, the ionized gas can be neutralized leading to a reduced current. The decrease in current triggers a fire alarm.\n\n"}

The battle is named after the mountain Aspromonte in southern Italy, which is near the place where the battle occurred. In the battle, the Royal Italian Army defeated Giuseppe Garibaldi's army of volunteers, who were marching from Sicily towards Rome, with the intent of annexing it into the Kingdom of Italy. In the battle, which took place a few kilometers from Gambarie, Garibaldi was wounded and taken prisoner.\n\nWhen Victor Emmanuel II became the King of Italy on 17 March 1861, the newly created Kingdom of Italy did not include Venice and Rome. These \"unredeemed\" cities, as they would be called a few decades later, were a constant cause of friction in Italian politics. The dispute concerning Rome, specifically known as the \"Roman Question\", had arisen after the Italian Parliament had declared Rome capital of the Kingdom on 27 March 1861. This conflicted with Pope Pius IX's intent to maintain his temporal control of the city.\n\nMembers of the government of the Kingdom of Italy had different perspectives on this issue, and the internal tensions that followed caused Prime Minister Bettino Ricasoli to resign in 1862. While his successor, Urbano Rattazzi, was known for his disrespectful attitude towards the Holy See, the Kingdom of Italy maintained a low profile on the Roman Question after Rattazzi's election.\n\nMeanwhile, General Giuseppe Garibaldi reached Sicily and began to form an army, with the intent of marching on Rome. The intransigent reaction of France (which was, at the time, the most influential ally of Italy) and the Pope caused the Italian government to intervene. On 3 August, Victor Emmanuel II officially condemned Garibaldi's \"guilty impatience\", and Rattazzi sent the Royal Army, at the orders of general Enrico Cialdini, to stop Garibaldi.\n\nGaribaldi was known and respected as a hero by most Italians, including most soldiers in the Royal Army and Navy. Several actions that occurred reveal that neither Garibaldi nor his opponents were willing to enter open combat, or cause too much damage to their opponent.\n\nAlthough Garibaldi's ships had likely been detected by the Royal Navy while they were crossing the Strait of Messina to reach land in Calabria, the Royal Army only attacked when Garibaldi's army had actually reached land, possibly to keep losses to a minimum. Garibaldi himself did not immediately counter-attack the Royal Army, instead trying to circumvent it by crossing the Aspromonte mountains.\n\nGaribaldi's army marched for three days; on 28 August 1862, the leading regiment, led by Garibaldi, camped near Gambarie, where the rest of his army was expected to arrive in a few days. On 29 August, before Garibaldi's army was reunited, Bersaglieri from the Royal Army reached Garibaldi's camp and attacked.\n\nGaribaldi ordered his army not to open fire \"on our brothers\", and some Bersaglieri changed sides during the battle, joining Garibaldi's volunteers. However, despite Garibaldi's order, one wing of his regiment mounted a counter-attack against the Bersaglieri. During the altercation, two bullets hit Garibaldi's hip and malleolus. A cease-fire was declared shortly thereafter, and Garibaldi surrendered.\n\nThe battle lasted for about ten minutes and resulted in around 15 casualties. Garibaldi, now wounded, was immediately assisted by surgeons and taken prisoner; he was later sent to the jail at Varignano, near Porto Venere. Garibaldi and his volunteers received amnesty on 5 October 1862; Garibaldi officially retired to Caprera, where he remained for two years.\n\nThe Day of Aspromonte caused both national and international criticism towards the Italian government, and caused the debate in Italy to become even harsher. Giuseppe Mazzini's party declared that, after the events of Aspromonte, any silent agreement between the Monarchy and the Republicans had been factually broken; supporters of the Monarchy maintained that the Republicans' support for such rash initiatives as Garibaldi's expedition proved that they were too irresponsible to lead the nation. Commentators accused the government of betraying the Italian revolution and being more supportive of the Pope than of Italy itself. \n\nIn 1863, Rattazzi was replaced by Marco Minghetti, who leveraged on the facts of Aspromonte to negotiate a treaty with France (the September Convention), in which Italy would protect the frontiers of the Papal States against foreign attacks, and France would withdraw its troops from Rome within two years. \n\nDespite the September Convention, annexing Rome remained an implicit objective of Italy. Garibaldi tried to march on Rome again in 1867. Eventually, the \"Questione Romana\" was solved under Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Lanza, when Rome was finally captured in 1870.\n\nA popular Italian nursery rhyme, \"Garibaldi fu ferito\" (\"Garibaldi was wounded\"), set to the melody of Bersaglieri's anthem, refers to the Battle of Aspromonte. The battle is also sometimes mentioned in political debate, when someone accuses the Italian government of betraying the expectations of the Italian people, or acting against national interests. \n"}

{"id": "2176142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176142", "title": "2012 Summer Olympics", "text": "2012 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics, formally the Games of the XXX Olympiad and commonly known as London 2012, was an international multi-sport event that was held from 27 July to 12 August 2012 in London, United Kingdom. The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July. 10,768 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated.\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city on 6 July 2005 during the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris. London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times, having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and in 1948.\n\nConstruction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability. The main focus was a new Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site at Stratford, East London. The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.\n\nThe Games received general praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm praised particularly highly. The opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim throughout the world, particular praise from the British public and a minority of widely ranging criticisms from some social media sites. During the Games, Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, so that every currently eligible country has sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games. Women's boxing was included for the first time, thus the Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n\nThe final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and host Great Britain. Several world and Olympic records were set at the games. Though there were several controversies, the 2012 games were deemed highly successful with the rising standards of competition amongst nations across the world, packed stadiums and smooth organisation. Furthermore, the focus on sporting legacy and post-games venue sustainability was seen as a blueprint for future Olympics.\n\nBy 15 July 2003, the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro. On 18 May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris. All five submitted their candidate files by 19 November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin. Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new head of London 2012 on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations. On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.\n\nTragically, the celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24 hours after the announcement.\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games after the success of the bid, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005. The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) was in charge of the construction of the venues and infrastructure. The latter was established in April 2006.\n\nThe Government Olympic Executive (GOE), a unit within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme programme management and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3 billion of public sector funding.\n\nIn August 2011, security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London due to the 2011 England riots, with a few countries expressing fear over the safety of the Games, in spite of the International Olympic Committee's assurance that the riots would not affect the Games.\n\nThe IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed its tenth and final visit to London in March 2012. Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".\n\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. After the Games, some of the new facilities will be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.\n\nThe majority of venues have been divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there are a few venues that, by necessity, are outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK. Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down. The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.\n\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed. The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest. The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction. Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.\n\nThere were some issues with the original venues not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations. The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London. North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of \"London Prepares\".\n\nTeam GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre and VIP lounge.\n\nLondon's public transport scored poorly in the IOC's initial evaluation; however, it felt that, if the improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope. Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service. According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day. During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games), westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station, and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games.\nTfL also built a £25 million cable car across the River Thames, called the Emirates Air Line, to link 2012 Olympics venues. It was inaugurated in June 2012 and crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour, cutting journey times between the O2 arena and the ExCeL exhibition centre and providing a crossing every 30 seconds.\n\nThe plan was to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event and 93% of them within 30 minutes of their event. The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour. In addition, LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport. Two park-and-ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars were 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park-and-ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet with a capacity for 9,000 cars where spectators could board a 10-minute shuttle train service. To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park-and-ride schemes were set up. These Park and Ride services were operated by First Games Transport part of FirstGroup.\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting between all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic ringsreserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes. The painting of Olympic lane indicators in mid-July led to confusion from commuters, who wrongly believed that the Olympic lane restrictions had already taken effect (they were to take effect on 27 July). The A4 experienced traffic jams due to drivers avoiding the Olympic lane, and likewise on a section of Southampton Row, where the only lanes available in one direction were the Olympic lane and the bus lane.\n\nConcerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer. However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011. Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.\n\nTfL created a promotional campaign and website, \"Get Ahead of the Games\", to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport during the Games. However, despite this encouragement to use bicycles, members of the public protested that riding bikes on London roads would be more dangerous due to the blocked Olympic lanes, and also protested against a decision to close the Lea Valley towpath during the Olympics and Paralympics due to security concerns.\n\nThe 2012 games were a unique operational task and a massive challenge for Heathrow airport. A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport, to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 was US$15 billion, compared to $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and $51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million. This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often cost as much or more than the sports-related costs.\n\nThe costs of mounting the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure, and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and Park costs were met largely by public money.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the original budget for the Games was increased to about £9.3 billion (US$15.28 billion) in 2007. The revised figures were announced to the House of Commons on 15 March 2007 by Tessa Jowell. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004. When recruitment took place in 2010, over 240,000 applications were received. Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\". The volunteers wore clothing which included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media which gain them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games, and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games. LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling, although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed. Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold. Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.\n\nIn Great Britain, ticket prices ranged from £20 for many events to £2,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Some free tickets were given to military personnel as part of the Tickets For Troops scheme, as well as to survivors and families of those who died during 7 July 2005 London bombings. Initially, people were able to apply for tickets via a website from 15 March until 26 April 2011. There was a huge demand for tickets, with a demand of over three times the number of tickets available. The process was widely criticised as more than 50% of the sessions went to a random ballot, and over half the people who applied got no tickets. On 11 May 2012 a round of nearly one million \"second chance\" tickets went on sale over a 10-day period between 23 June and 3 July 2011. About 1.7 million tickets were available for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, field hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball. Although technical difficulties were encountered, ten sports had sold out by 8 am of the first day.\n\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London, One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall.\n\nA countdown clock in Trafalgar Square was unveiled, 500 days before the Games. The clock broke down the following day, but was later fixed. It was a two-sided clock with the Paralympic countdown on the other side.\nThe countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.\n\nThe security operation was led by the police, with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the armed forces. Naval and air assets, including ships situated in the Thames, Eurofighter jets and surface-to-air missiles, were deployed as part of the security operation; the biggest security operation Britain had faced for decades. The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was more than Britain currently had deployed in Afghanistan. The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Lynx Navy helicopter.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence distributed leaflets to residents of the Lexington building in Bow, announcing that a missile system was to be stationed on top of the water tower. This caused concern to some residents. The Ministry said it probably would use Starstreak missiles and that site evaluations had taken place, but that no final decision had taken place.\n\nApproximately 4,700 Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant. They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics). 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S. The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine. Each medal weighs , has a diameter of and is thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim. The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\". The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.\n\nEach gold medal is made up of 92.5 percent silver and 1.34 percent gold, with the remainder copper. The silver medal (which represents second place) is made up of 92.5 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The bronze medal is made up of 97 percent copper, 2.5 percent zinc and 0.5 percent tin. The value of the materials in the gold medal is about £410 (US$644), the silver about £210 (US$330), and the bronze about £3 (US$4.71) as of 30 July 2012.\n\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.\n\nOn 18 May 2012 the Olympic flame arrived at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall from Greece on flight BA2012, operated by a British Airways Airbus A319 named \"Firefly\".\n\nThe relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about , starting from Land's End in Cornwall. The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the Isle of Man on 2 June, Dublin in Ireland, on 6 June, and both Guernsey and Jersey on 15 July.\n\nThe relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events. Dumfries and Galloway was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice. A group of young athletes, nominated by retired Olympic athletes, ran the torch around the stadium. These torchbearers were Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds, and Adelle Tracey. Together the torchbearers each lit a petal which spread the fire to the 204 petals of the cauldron, representing the countries that participated in the games.\n\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process. Renewable energy also features at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now be as little as 9%. Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons. The focus has since moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Food packaging at the Olympics is made from compostable materials – like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics – where it cannot be re-used or recycled. This includes fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used, many of these materials would be suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.\n\nBuildings like the Water Polo Arena will be relocated elsewhere. Building Parts like Roofing Covers and membranes of different temporary venues will be recycled via Vinyloop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection. Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy is fulfilled. It says that\n\n\"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme\" says Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park.\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC.\n\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\nLOCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire period during which the Olympic Village is open.\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad comprises many programmes, with over 500 events spread over four years across the whole of the United Kingdom, and culminating in the London 2012 Festival.\n\nThe opening ceremony officially began at 9:00 pm British Summer Time (UTC+1) on 27 July in the Olympic Stadium and was called \"Isles of Wonder\". Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle was its artistic director, with music direction by Rick Smith of Underworld.\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was the second Games the Queen had opened personally, the first being in 1976 in Montreal. The ceremony included a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself, and another starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean.\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, the London Symphony Orchestra, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act. The ceremony transmitted live on BBC One attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27 million in the UK.\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nAround 10,700 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) took part, (79 countries acquired at least one medal: gold, silver or bronze) surpassing the 1948 Summer Olympics in London and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester as the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in the United Kingdom.\n\nThree athletes from the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee, which the IOC Executive Committee had ceased to recognise at the IOC session of July 2011, and one athlete from South Sudan, which had no recognized NOC, participated independently under the Olympic flag.\n\nDuring the Games some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout London.\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics featured 26 different sports encompassing 39 disciplines and 302 events. In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\nWomen's boxing was included in the programme for the first time, and 36 women competed in three weight classes. There was a special dispensation for the shooting events, which would otherwise have been illegal under UK gun law. In tennis, mixed doubles returned to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1924.\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics. The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics, special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics. There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket and netball tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\nThe final official schedule was released on 15 February 2011.\nThese Olympic Games resulted in 32 world records in eight sports. The largest number of records were set in swimming, at eight. China, Great Britain and the United States set the most records, at five each.\n\nA total of 85 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) won medals, 54 of those countries winning at least one gold medal. Bahrain, Botswana, Cyprus, Gabon, Grenada (a gold medal), Guatemala, and Montenegro won their first ever Olympic medals. The United States finished at the top of the table winning 46 gold medals and winning 103 medals overall. China finished second with 38 gold medals and 88 medals overall. Hosts Great Britain came in third place winning 29 gold medals and 65 medals overall in their best performance since London hosted its inaugural Summer Olympics in 1908 pushing Russia into fourth place who won 19 gold medals although they won 68 medals (3 more than Great Britain) overall.\n\n Host nation (Great Britain)\n\nThe host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras, and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters, to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.\n\nThe IOC's wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and London 2012 was covered by several national and regional broadcasters. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games. BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for over half the rights revenue for the IOC. Thousands of Americans, however, accessed the BBC's omnibus coverage using proxy servers or VPNs. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage. The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.\n\nIn Sri Lanka a dispute occurred between Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and MBC Networks (MTV/MBC) as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster. However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between Carlton Sports Network (CSN) and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the games the International Olympic Committee in November 2012 announced the winners of the Golden rings for the best broadcast coverage of the games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln / Gary Milkis, Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe kayak slalom and rowing/canoe sprint came second and third. The best on air promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. The best Olympic feature saw NBC Olympics win again as Sky Italia and ZDF completed the podium places. The best athlete's profile went to TV record NBC claimed second with their profile of David Rudisha while a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola saw ESPN Latin America take third. The best Olympic program went NBC, while host broadcasters BBC took the silver trophy for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games) and bronze was claimed by Seven Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.\n\n\"Survival\" by Muse was announced as the official song of the Olympics, to be played by international broadcasters reporting on the Games. In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissioned artists and illustrators to design 30 stamps, which were released in batches of 10 between 2009 and 2011. The last ones were released on 22 July 2011. Two £5 coins designed by Saiman Miah have been made to commemorate the Olympics. As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will strike a set of commemorative one-kilogram gold and silver coins.\n\nThe official motto for the 2012 Summer Olympics is \"Inspire a generation\". It was chosen to highlight the organiser's commitment to inspire the world including younger generations to get involved in sporting events through its games' legacy.\n\nThere have been two London 2012 logos: one created by Kino Design for the bidding process and a second as the brand for the Games themselves. The former was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The latter, designed by Wolff Olins, was published on 4 June 2007. It is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.\n\nPublic reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely negative; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating. Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers, and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo. A segment of animated footage released at the same time as the logo was reported to trigger seizures in a small number of people with photosensitive epilepsy, and a short segment was removed from the London 2012 website in response. It was suggested that the logo resembled the cartoon character Lisa Simpson performing fellatio on her brother Bart Simpson.\nIn February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.\n\nThe official London 2012 Olympic typeface was called Headline 2012 and also suffered some criticism. Journalist Simon Garfield made it number 1 in the list of the \"8 Worst Fonts in the World\" in his 2010 book \"Just My Type\", commenting that \"the uncool font is based on jaggedness and crudeness\", although he conceded that it was \"a brilliant piece of corporate branding\". The magazine \"Wired\" pointed out that the typeface was intended for \"awareness, impact and memorability as a headline typeface\" rather than elegance or readability in long sections of text.\n\n The 4 primary colours used in the branding of the games are Pink, Blue, Green, and Orange. These colours were chosen to showcase the spirit of the games: energetic, spirited, youthful, and bright.\n\nThe official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games were unveiled on 19 May 2010. Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton. They are named after Much Wenlock, a town in Shropshire that holds a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville, a village in Buckinghamshire where a forerunner of the Paralympic Games was first held. The writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept for the mascots, and an animation was produced. Two stories have been created about the mascots: \"Out Of A Rainbow\" and \"Adventures On A Rainbow\".\n\n\"Creative Review\" magazine liked the mascots, but elsewhere their design was greeted with some disdain. One columnist jested that they were the product of a \"drunken one-night stand between a Teletubby and a Dalek\". Others have compared them to Izzy, the much disparaged mascot of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. Still others have likened them to Kang and Kodos from \"The Simpsons\". However, the mascots' creators claim that young people find the duo appealing.\n\nThe 1981 Best Picture Oscar–winning film \"Chariots of Fire\", which tells the story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics. A digitally re-mastered version of \"Chariots of Fire\" was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations, and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013. The film's theme tune was performed during the Opening Ceremony by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle. The performance was accompanied by a comedic skit by Rowan Atkinson, which included the opening beach-running footage from the film. A new orchestration of the film's theme tune was played during each medal presentation of the Games.\n\nLOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three. The worldwide partners were: Acer, Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega SA, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa. Tier one partners were: Adidas, BMW, BP, British Airways, BT Group, EDF Energy and Lloyds Tsb. The tier two partners were: Adecco, ArcelorMittal, Cadbury, Deloitte, Thomas Cook Group, Cisco Systems and United Parcel Service. Tier three partners were: Aggreko, Airwave, Atkins, The Boston Consulting Group, CBS Outdoor, Crystal CG, Eurostar, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, G4S, GlaxoSmithKline, Gymnova, Heathrow Airport, Heineken, Holiday Inn, John Lewis & Partners, McCann Worldgroup, Mondo, Nature Valley, Next, Nielsen Company, Populous (company), Rapiscan Systems, Rio Tinto (corporation), Technogym, Thames Water, Ticketmaster, Trebor and Westfield Group. The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship, the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.\n\nDuring the Games, eight competitors in the badminton women's doubles were disqualified for \"not using best efforts\", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds. A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.\n\nYe Shiwen faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, her last 50m was swum 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner of the corresponding race. All charges were later dropped.\n\nJust before the start of the Men's 100m Final, a spectator threw a plastic bottle into Tyson Gay's lane, intended to hit Usain Bolt who was three lanes outside in Lane 7. The race was unaffected, and Bolt would go on to become the second man in history to defend a 100m Olympic title. The spectator, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, was soon arrested after he was struck on the head by Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, whom he happened to be sitting next to. LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player\". Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court. He was later found guilty.\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games. Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances. As of late 2017, 31 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 15 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2176146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176146", "title": "Cleveland Street scandal", "text": "Cleveland Street scandal\n\nThe Cleveland Street scandal occurred in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel on Cleveland Street, London, was discovered by police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons.\n\nAt the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne, had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the British press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced the handling of the case by the authorities and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.\n\nThe police acquired testimonies that Lord Arthur Somerset, an equerry to the Prince of Wales, was a patron. Both he and the brothel keeper, Charles Hammond, managed to flee abroad before a prosecution could be brought. The male prostitutes, who also worked as telegraph messenger boys for the Post Office, were given light sentences and no clients were prosecuted. After Henry James FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, was named in the press as a client, he successfully sued for libel.\n\nThe scandal fuelled the attitude that male homosexuality was an aristocratic vice that corrupted lower-class youths. Such perceptions were still prevalent in 1895 when the Marquess of Queensberry accused Oscar Wilde of being an active homosexual.\n\nIn July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was investigating a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered to be in possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash in the course of their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.\n\nConstable Hanks reported the matter to his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as procurement or attempted procurement of such acts, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house locked and Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in Camden Town. In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in Gravesend.\n\nOn the way to the police station, Newlove named Lord Arthur Somerset and Henry FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, as well as an army colonel by the name of Jervois, as visitors to Cleveland Street. Somerset was the head of the Prince of Wales's stables. Although Somerset was interviewed by police, no immediate action was taken against him, and the authorities were slow to act on the allegations of Somerset's involvement. A watch was placed on the now-empty house and details of the case shuffled between government departments.\n\nOn 19 August, an arrest warrant was issued in the name of George Veck, an acquaintance of Hammond's who pretended to be a clergyman. Veck had actually worked at the Telegraph Office, but had been sacked for \"improper conduct\" with the messenger boys. A seventeen-year-old youth found in Veck's London lodgings revealed to the police that Veck had gone to Portsmouth and was returning shortly by train. The police arrested Veck at London Waterloo railway station. In his pockets they discovered letters from Algernon Allies. Abberline sent Constable Hanks to interview Allies at his parents' home in Sudbury, Suffolk. Allies admitted to receiving money from Somerset, having a sexual relationship with him, and working at Cleveland Street for Hammond. On 22 August, police interviewed Somerset for a second time, after which Somerset left for Bad Homburg, where the Prince of Wales was taking his summer holiday.\n\nOn 11 September, Newlove and Veck were committed for trial. Their defence was handled by Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, with Willie Mathews appearing for Newlove, and Charles Gill for Veck. Somerset paid the legal fees. By this time, Somerset had moved on to Hanover, to inspect some horses for the Prince of Wales, and the press was referring to \"noble lords\" implicated in the trial. Newlove and Veck pleaded guilty to indecency on 18 September and the judge, Sir Thomas Chambers, a former Liberal Member of Parliament who had a reputation for leniency, sentenced them to four and nine months' hard labour respectively. The boys were also given sentences that were considered at the time to be very lenient. Hammond escaped to France, but the French authorities expelled him after pressure from the British. Hammond moved on to Belgium from where he emigrated to the United States. Newton, acting for Somerset, paid for Hammond's passage. On the advice of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, no extradition proceedings were attempted, and the case against Hammond was quietly dropped.\n\nSomerset returned to Britain in late September to attend horse sales at Newmarket but suddenly left for Dieppe on 26 September, probably after being told by Newton that he was in danger of being arrested. He returned again on 30 September. A few days later, his grandmother, Emily Somerset, Dowager Duchess of Beaufort, died and he attended her funeral. The Hon. Hamilton Cuffe, Assistant Treasury Solicitor, and James Monro, Commissioner of Police, pressed for action to be taken against Somerset, but the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, blocked any prosecution. Rumours of Somerset's involvement were circulating, and on 19 October Somerset fled back to France. Lord Salisbury was later accused of warning Somerset through Sir Dighton Probyn, who had met Lord Salisbury the evening before, that a warrant for his arrest was imminent. This was denied by Lord Salisbury and the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster. Probyn's informant may have been the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Richard Pearson. The Prince of Wales wrote to Lord Salisbury, expressing satisfaction that Somerset had been allowed to leave the country and asking that if Somerset should \"ever dare to show his face in England again\", he would remain unmolested by the authorities, but Lord Salisbury was also being pressured by the police to prosecute Somerset. On 12 November, a warrant for Somerset's arrest was finally issued. By this time, Somerset was already safely abroad, and the warrant caught little public attention. After an unsuccessful search for employment in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, Somerset lived the rest of his life in self-imposed and comfortable exile in the south of France. Other names mentioned by the press were Lord Ronald Gower and Lord Errol. Also implicated was the prominent social figure Alexander Meyrick Broadley, who fled abroad for four years. The Paris \"Figaro\" even alleged that Broadley took General Georges Boulanger and Henri Rochefort to the house. The allegation against Boulanger was later challenged by his supporters. In December 1889 it was reported that both the Prince and Princess of Wales were being \"daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character\" bearing upon the scandal. By January 1890 sixty suspects had been identified, twenty-two of whom had fled the country.\n\nBecause the press barely covered the story, the affair would have faded quickly from public memory if not for journalist Ernest Parke. The editor of the obscure politically radical weekly \"The North London Press\", Parke got wind of the affair when one of his reporters brought him the story of Newlove's conviction. Parke began to question why the prostitutes had been given such light sentences relative to their offence (the usual penalty for \"gross indecency\" was two years) and how Hammond had been able to evade arrest. His curiosity aroused, Parke found out that the boys had named prominent aristocrats. He subsequently ran a story on 28 September hinting at their involvement but without detailing specific names. It was only on 16 November that he published a follow up story specifically naming Henry Fitzroy, Earl of Euston, in \"an indescribably loathsome scandal in Cleveland Street\". He further alleged that Euston may have gone to Peru and that he had been allowed to escape to cover up the involvement of a more highly placed person, who was not named but was believed by some to be Prince Albert Victor, the son of the Prince of Wales.\n\nEuston was in fact still in England and immediately filed a case against Parke for libel. At the trial, Euston admitted that when walking along Piccadilly a tout had given him a card which read \"\"Poses plastiques\". C. Hammond, 19 Cleveland Street\". Euston testified that he went to the house believing \"Poses plastiques\" meant a display of female nudes. He paid a sovereign to get in but upon entering Euston said he was appalled to discover the \"improper\" nature of the place and immediately left. The defence witnesses contradicted each other, and could not describe Euston accurately. The final defence witness, John Saul, was a male prostitute who had earlier been involved in a homosexual scandal at Dublin Castle, and featured in a clandestinely published erotic novel \"The Sins of the Cities of the Plain\" which was cast as his autobiography. Delivering his testimony in a manner described as \"brazen effrontery\", Saul admitted to earning his living by leading an \"immoral life\" and \"practising criminality\", and detailed his alleged sexual encounters with Euston at the house. The defence did not call either Newlove or Veck as witnesses, and could not produce any evidence that Euston had left the country. On 16 January 1890, the jury found Parke guilty and the judge sentenced him to twelve months in prison. One historian considers Euston was telling the truth and only visited Cleveland Street once because he was misled by the card. However, another has alleged Euston was a well-known figure in the homosexual underworld, and was extorted so often by the notorious blackmailer Robert Cliburn, that Oscar Wilde had quipped Cliburn deserved the Victoria Cross for his tenacity. Saul stated that he told the police his story in August, which provoked the judge to enquire rhetorically why the authorities had not taken action.\n\nThe judge, Sir Henry Hawkins, had a distinguished career, although after his death a former Solicitor General for England and Wales, Sir Edward Clarke, wrote: \"Sir Henry Hawkins was the worst judge I ever knew or heard of. He had no notion whatever of what justice meant, or of the obligations of truth or fairness.\" The prosecuting counsels, Charles Russell and Willie Mathews, went on to become Lord Chief Justice and Director of Public Prosecutions, respectively. The defence counsel, Frank Lockwood, later became Solicitor General, and he was assisted by H. H. Asquith, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twenty years later.\n\nWhile Parke's conviction cleared Euston, another trial began on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, was charged with obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty to one of the six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.\n\nDuring Newton's trial, a motion in Parliament sought to investigate Parke's allegations of a cover-up. Henry Labouchère, a Member of Parliament from the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, was staunchly against homosexuality and had campaigned successfully to add the \"gross indecency\" amendment (known as the \"Labouchère Amendment\") to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. He was convinced that the conspiracy to cover up the scandal went further up the government than assumed. Labouchère made his suspicions known in Parliament on 28 February 1890. He denied that \"a gentleman of very high position\"—presumably Prince Albert Victor—was in any way involved with the scandal, but accused the government of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He suggested that the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and other officials colluded to hamper the investigation, allowing Somerset and Hammond to escape, delaying the trials and failing to prosecute the case with vigour. Labouchère's accusations were rebutted by the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster, who was also the prosecutor in the Newton case. Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Parke and was defending Newton, sat on the Liberal benches with Labouchère but refused to be drawn into the debate. After an often passionate debate over seven hours, during which Labouchère was expelled from Parliament after saying \"I do not believe Lord Salisbury\" and refusing to withdraw his remark, the motion was defeated by a wide margin, 206–66. In a subsequent speech to the House of Lords, Salisbury bore witness against himself by suggesting his memory of his handling of the affair was defective.\n\nPublic interest in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited by members of the upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.\n\nOscar Wilde alluded to the scandal in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", first published in 1890. Reviews of the novel were hostile; in a clear reference to the Cleveland Street scandal, one reviewer called it suitable for \"none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys\". Wilde's 1891 revision of the novel omitted certain key passages, which were considered too homoerotic. In 1895, Wilde unsuccessfully sued Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, for libel. Sir Edward Carson, Lord Queensberry's counsel, used quotes from the novel against Wilde and questioned him about his associations with young working men. After the failure of his suit, Wilde was charged with gross indecency, found guilty and subsequently sentenced to two years' hard labour. He was prosecuted by Charles Gill, who had defended Veck in the Cleveland Street case.\n\nPrince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society gossip about his sex life continued. Sixty years after the scandal the official biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy at the time of the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor \"had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated.\" In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, \"I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true.\" Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, \"I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing ... we were both accused of going to this place but not together ... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention.\" In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to \"cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV\" and \"false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story\". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the \"New York Herald\" published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying \"there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor.\" Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as \"ardently heterosexual\" and his involvement in the rumours as \"somewhat unfair\".\n\nIn 1902 an American newspaper alleged that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned in some way that 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance and that he may have been identified as a visitor, contrived to bring the prince to the house on an innocent pretext in the hope that the police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the prince's fondness for boulle furniture: he invited him to inspect a boulle cabinet which was in the house, and the prince remained there for no more than five minutes.\n\nThe site of the brothel at 19 Cleveland Street, Marylebone, and its historical context within the homosexual and other transgressive communities of London's Fitzrovia and neighbouring Soho and Bloomsbury, has become the subject of academic study and general interest. In Parliament, Labouchère indignantly described 19 Cleveland Street as \"in no obscure thoroughfare, but nearly opposite the Middlesex Hospital\". The house, which was located on the western side of Cleveland Street, no longer survives: it was demolished in the 1890s for an extension of the Hospital, which itself was bulldozed in 2005. Two sketches of the house were published by \"The Illustrated Police News\".\n\nIt has occasionally been claimed that the house survives. This theory proposes that, following a renumbering of the street, No. 19 was deleted from the Land Survey to suppress its existence, and that the house is the current No. 18 on the eastern side of the street. Cleveland Street was indeed renumbered: the southernmost end was originally Norfolk Street. (For example, the current number 22 Cleveland Street, was originally 10 Norfolk Street, and for a time was the home of Charles Dickens.) However, the renumbering of Cleveland Street was ordered in 1867, long before the scandal, by the Metropolitan Board of Works: \"the odd numbers, commencing with 1 and ending with 175, being assigned to the houses on the Western side; that the even numbers, commencing with 2 and ending with 140, to those on the Eastern side; that such numbers do commence at the Southern end.\" An Ordnance Survey of 1870 also shows No. 19 and its adjacent houses on the street's western side. In an 1894 Ordnance Survey these properties have been subsumed by the new Middlesex Hospital wing. \n\n\n"}

It is currently used by the university's track and field, cross country, football, and soccer teams. It is located in St. Louis County, Missouri on the far western edge of the university's Danforth Campus. Built in time for the 1904 World's Fair, the stadium once had a 19,000-person seating capacity, but stadium renovations in 1984 reduced the capacity to 3,300 people. It is one of the oldest sports venues west of the Mississippi River that is still in use. Francis Olympic Field now utilizes artificial Field Turf, which can be configured for both soccer and football.\n\nFrancis Olympic Field was named for former Missouri governor and president of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition David R. Francis in October 1907. The word \"Olympic\" was added in 2019 to reflect its role in the 1904 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics (the first to be held in the Western Hemisphere) were given to St. Louis, Missouri as a result of the efforts of David Rowland Francis, for whom the stadium and accompanying gymnasium are named. Built in 1902, Francis Olympic Field's permanent stands represent one of the first applications of reinforced concrete technology. Both the stadium and its gymnasium are U.S. National Historic Landmarks. During those games, the stadium hosted the archery, athletics, cycling, football, gymnastics, lacrosse, roque, tug of war, weightlifting, and wrestling events. At some dirt courts located outside the stadium, the tennis events took place.\n\nFollowing the 1904 Olympics, the stadium became the permanent home of the Bears, who were formerly known as the Pikers. From the 1920s through the 1950s, the Bears played before crowds of as many as 19,000 people, competing against universities such as Notre Dame, Nebraska, and Boston College, with half of the spectators in temporary wooden stands. The Bears now play as an NCAA Division III team.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Francis Olympic Field had its natural grass replaced with artificial FieldTurf.\n\nFrancis Olympic Field is an annual host for the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life event.\n\nThe Francis Gymnasium was the site of four U.S. presidential debates in 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, plus the vice-presidential debate in 2008.\n\nDuring both the 1984 and 1996 Olympic Torch relays, the Olympic Flame passed by Francis Olympic Field on its way to the site of the Olympic Games.\n\nFrancis Olympic Field hosted the 1986 AAU/USA National Junior Olympic Games, the first and second National Senior Olympic Games, and the 1985 NCAA Division III National Men's Soccer Championship.\n\nIn July 1994, Francis Olympic Field served as a centerpiece for the U.S. Olympic Festival as 3,000 athletes were housed on the campus for the country's top amateur sporting events.\n\nThe stadium was used by the St. Louis Stars soccer team during 1969–1970, and again in 1975–1977, before their 1978 move to Anaheim, California, as they became the California Surf.\n\n"}
{"id": "2176160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176160", "title": "Interval arithmetic", "text": "Interval arithmetic\n\nInterval arithmetic, interval mathematics, interval analysis, or interval computation, is a method developed by mathematicians since the 1950s and 1960s, as an approach to putting bounds on rounding errors and measurement errors in mathematical computation and thus developing numerical methods that yield reliable results. Very simply put, it represents each value as a range of possibilities. For example, instead of estimating the height of someone using standard arithmetic as 2.0 metres, using interval arithmetic one might be certain that that person is somewhere between 1.97 and 2.03 metres.\n\nThis concept is suitable for a variety of purposes. The most common use is to keep track of and handle rounding errors directly during the calculation and of uncertainties in the knowledge of the exact values of physical and technical parameters. The latter often arise from measurement errors and tolerances for components or due to limits on computational accuracy. Interval arithmetic also helps find reliable and guaranteed solutions to equations (such as differential equations) and optimization problems.\n\nMathematically, instead of working with an uncertain real formula_1 one works with the two ends of the interval formula_2 that contains formula_1. In interval arithmetic, any variable formula_1 lies between formula_5 and formula_6, or could be one of them. A function formula_7 when applied to formula_1 is also uncertain. In interval arithmetic formula_7 produces an interval formula_10 that is all the possible values for formula_11 for all formula_12.\n\nThe main focus of interval arithmetic is a simple way to calculate upper and lower endpoints for the range of values of a function in one or more variables. These endpoints are not necessarily the supremum or infimum, since the precise calculation of those values can be difficult or impossible.\n\nTreatment is typically limited to real intervals, so quantities of form\nwhere formula_14 and formula_15 are allowed; with one of them infinite we would have an unbounded interval, while with both infinite we would have the extended real number line.\n\nAs with traditional calculations with real numbers, simple arithmetic operations and functions on elementary intervals must first be defined. More complicated functions can be calculated from these basic elements.\n\nTake as an example the calculation of body mass index (BMI). The BMI is the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres. A bathroom scale may have a resolution of one kilogram. We do not know intermediate values about 79.6 kg or 80.3 kg but information rounded to the nearest whole number. It is unlikely that when the scale reads 80 kg, someone really weighs exactly 80.0 kg. In normal rounding to the nearest value, the scales showing 80 kg indicates a weight between 79.5 kg and 80.5 kg. The relevant range is that of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 79.5, while less than or equal to 80.5, or in other words the interval [79.5,80.5].\n\nFor a man who weighs 80 kg and is 1.80 m tall, the BMI is about 24.7. With a weight of 79.5 kg and the same height the value is 24.5, while 80.5 kilograms gives almost 24.9. So the actual BMI is in the range [24.5,24.9]. The error in this case does not affect the conclusion (normal weight), but this is not always the position. For example, weight fluctuates in the course of a day so that the BMI can vary between 24 (normal weight) and 25 (overweight). Without detailed analysis it is not possible to always exclude questions as to whether an error ultimately is large enough to have significant influence.\n\nInterval arithmetic states the range of possible outcomes explicitly. Simply put, results are no longer stated as numbers, but as intervals that represent imprecise values. The size of the intervals are similar to error bars to a metric in expressing the extent of uncertainty. Simple arithmetic operations, such as basic arithmetic and trigonometric functions, enable the calculation of outer limits of intervals.\n\nReturning to the earlier BMI example, in determining the body mass index, height and body weight both affect the result. For height, measurements are usually in round centimetres: a recorded measurement of 1.80 metres actually means a height somewhere between 1.795 m and 1.805 m. This uncertainty must be combined with the fluctuation range in weight between 79.5 kg and 80.5 kg. The BMI is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metre. Using either 79.5 kg and 1.795 m or 80.5 kg and 1.805 m gives approximately 24.7. But the person in question may only be 1.795 m tall, with a weight of 80.5 kilograms or 1.805 m and 79.5 kilograms: all combinations of all possible intermediate values must be considered. Using the interval arithmetic methods described below, the BMI lies in the interval\n\nAn operation formula_17, such as addition or multiplication, on two intervals is defined by\n\nIf the formula_17 is monotone in each operand on the intervals, which is the case for the four basic arithmetic operations (except division when the denominator interval contains formula_20), the extreme values occur at the endpoints of the operand intervals. Writing out all combinations, one way of stating this is\nprovided that formula_22 is well-defined for all formula_23 and formula_24.\n\nFor practical applications this can be simplified further:\n\n\nThe last case loses useful information about formula_30. So typically it is common to work with formula_31 and formula_32 as separate intervals.\n\nBecause several such divisions may occur in an interval arithmetic calculation, it is sometimes useful to do the calculation with so-called \"multi-intervals\" of the form\n\nThe corresponding \"multi-interval arithmetic\" maintains a disjoint set of intervals and also provides for overlapping intervals to unite.\n\nSince a real number formula_34 can be interpreted as the interval formula_35 intervals and real numbers can be freely and easily combined.\n\nWith the help of these definitions, it is already possible to calculate the range of simple functions, such as formula_36 If for example, formula_37 and formula_38 it is clear\n\nInterpreting this as a function formula_40 of the variable formula_1 with interval parameters formula_5 and formula_6, then it is possible to find the roots of this function. It is then\n\nthe possible zeros are in the interval formula_45\n\nAs in the above example, the multiplication of intervals often only requires two multiplications. It is in fact\n\nThe multiplication can be seen as a destination area of a rectangle with varying edges. The result interval covers all levels from the smallest to the largest.\n\nThe same applies when one of the two intervals is non-positive and the other non-negative. Generally, multiplication can produce results as wide as formula_47 for example if formula_48 is squared. This also occurs, for example, in a division, if the numerator and denominator both contain zero.\n\nTo make the notation of intervals smaller in formulae, brackets can be used.\n\nSo we can use formula_49 to represent an interval. For the set of all finite intervals, we can use\n\nas an abbreviation. For a vector of intervals formula_51 we can also use a bold font: formula_52.\n\nNote that in such a compact notation, formula_53 should not be confused between a so-called improper or single point interval formula_54 and the lower and upper limit.\n\nInterval methods can also apply to functions that do not just use simple arithmetic, and we must also use other basic functions to redefine intervals, using already known monotonicity properties.\n\nFor monotonic functions in one variable, the range of values is also easy. If formula_55 is monotonically increasing or decreasing in the interval formula_56 then for all formula_57 such that formula_58 one of the following inequalities applies:\n\nThe range corresponding to the interval formula_60 can be calculated by applying the function to its endpoints:\n\nFrom this the following basic features for interval functions can easily be defined:\n\n\nFor even powers, the range of values being considered is important, and needs to be dealt with before doing any multiplication. For example, formula_69 for formula_70 should produce the interval formula_71 when formula_72 But if formula_73 is taken by applying interval multiplication of form formula_74 then the result appears to be formula_75 wider than necessary.\n\nInstead consider the function formula_69 as a monotonically decreasing function for formula_77 and a monotonically increasing function for formula_78 So for even formula_79:\n\nMore generally, one can say that for piecewise monotonic functions it is sufficient to consider the endpoints formula_81 of the interval formula_65, together with the so-called \"critical points\" within the interval being those points where the monotonicity of the function changes direction.\n\nFor the sine and cosine functions, the critical points are at formula_83 or formula_84 for all formula_85 respectively. Only up to five points matter as the resulting interval is formula_86 if the interval includes at least two extrema. For sine and cosine, only the endpoints need full evaluation as the critical points lead to easily pre-calculated values – namely -1, 0, +1.\n\nIn general, it may not be easy to find such a simple description of the output interval for many functions. But it may still be possible to extend functions to interval arithmetic.\nIf formula_87 is a function from a real vector to a real number, then  formula_88 is called an \"interval extension\" of formula_7 if\n\nThis definition of the interval extension does not give a precise result. For example, both formula_91 and formula_92 are allowable extensions of the exponential function. Extensions as tight as possible are desirable, taking into account the relative costs of calculation and imprecision; in this case formula_93 should be chosen as it gives the tightest possible result.\n\nThe \"natural interval extension\" is achieved by combining the function rule formula_94 with the equivalents of the basic arithmetic and elementary functions.\n\nThe \"Taylor interval extension\" (of degree formula_95 ) is a formula_96 times differentiable function formula_7 defined by\n\nfor some formula_99,\nwhere formula_100 is the formula_101th order differential of formula_7 at the point formula_103 and formula_104 is an interval extension of the \"Taylor remainder\"\n\nThe vector formula_106 lies between formula_107\nand formula_103 with formula_109, formula_106 is protected by formula_52.\nUsually one chooses formula_103 to be the midpoint of the interval and uses the natural interval extension to assess the remainder.\n\nThe special case of the Taylor interval extension of degree formula_113 is also referred to as the \"mean value form\".\nFor an interval extension of the Jacobian formula_114\nwe get\n\nA nonlinear function can be defined by linear features.\n\nAn interval can also be defined as a locus of points at a given distance from the centre, and this definition can be extended from real numbers to complex numbers. As it is the case with computing with real numbers, computing with complex numbers involves uncertain data. So, given the fact that an interval number is a real closed interval and a complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers, there is no reason to limit the application of interval arithmetic to the measure of uncertainties in computations with real numbers. Interval arithmetic can thus be extended, via complex interval numbers, to determine regions of uncertainty in computing with complex numbers.\n\nThe basic algebraic operations for real interval numbers (real closed intervals) can be extended to complex numbers. It is therefore not surprising that complex interval arithmetic is similar to, but not the same as, ordinary complex arithmetic. It can be shown that, as it is the case with real interval arithmetic, there is no distributivity between addition and multiplication of complex interval numbers except for certain special cases, and inverse elements do not always exist for complex interval numbers. Two other useful properties of ordinary complex arithmetic fail to hold in complex interval arithmetic: the additive and multiplicative properties, of ordinary complex conjugates, do not hold for complex interval conjugates.\n\nInterval arithmetic can be extended, in an analogous manner, to other multidimensional number systems such as quaternions and octonions, but with the expense that we have to sacrifice other useful properties of ordinary arithmetic.\n\nThe methods of classical numerical analysis can not be transferred one-to-one into interval-valued algorithms, as dependencies between numerical values are usually not taken into account.\n\nTo work effectively in a real-life implementation, intervals must be compatible with floating point computing. The earlier operations were based on exact arithmetic, but in general fast numerical solution methods may not be available. The range of values of the function formula_116\nfor formula_117 and formula_118 are for example formula_119. Where the same calculation is done with single digit precision, the result would normally be formula_120. But formula_121,\nso this approach would contradict the basic principles of interval arithmetic, as a part of the domain of formula_122 would be lost.\nInstead, the outward rounded solution formula_123 is used.\n\nThe standard IEEE 754 for binary floating-point arithmetic also sets out procedures for the implementation of rounding. An IEEE 754 compliant system allows programmers to round to the nearest floating point number; alternatives are rounding towards 0 (truncating), rounding toward positive infinity (i.e. up), or rounding towards negative infinity (i.e. down).\n\nThe required \"external rounding\" for interval arithmetic can thus be achieved by changing the rounding settings of the processor in the calculation of the upper limit (up) and lower limit (down). Alternatively, an appropriate small interval formula_124 can be added.\n\nThe so-called \"dependency problem\" is a major obstacle to the application of interval arithmetic. Although interval methods can determine the range of elementary arithmetic operations and functions very accurately, this is not always true with more complicated functions. If an interval occurs several times in a calculation using parameters, and each occurrence is taken independently then this can lead to an unwanted expansion of the resulting intervals.\n\nAs an illustration, take the function formula_7 defined by formula_126 The values of this function over the interval formula_127 are formula_128 As the natural interval extension, it is calculated as:\n\nwhich is slightly larger; we have instead calculated the infimum and supremum of the function formula_130 over formula_131 There is a better expression of formula_7 in which the variable formula_1 only appears once, namely by rewriting formula_134 as addition and squaring in the quadratic\n\nSo the suitable interval calculation is\n\nand gives the correct values.\n\nIn general, it can be shown that the exact range of values can be achieved, if each variable appears only once and if formula_7 is continuous inside the box. However, not every function can be rewritten this way.\nThe dependency of the problem causing over-estimation of the value range can go as far as covering a large range, preventing more meaningful conclusions.\n\nAn additional increase in the range stems from the solution of areas that do not take the form of an interval vector. The solution set of the linear system\n\nis precisely the line between the points formula_139 and formula_140 Using interval methods results in the unit square, formula_141 This is known as the \"wrapping effect\".\n\nA linear interval system consists of a matrix interval extension formula_142 and an interval vector formula_143. We want the smallest cuboid formula_144, for all vectors\nformula_145 which there is a pair formula_146 with formula_147 and formula_148 satisfying\n\nFor quadratic systems – in other words, for formula_150 – there can be such an interval vector formula_52, which covers all possible solutions, found simply with the interval Gauss method. This replaces the numerical operations, in that the linear algebra method known as Gaussian elimination becomes its interval version. However, since this method uses the interval entitiesformula_152 and formula_153 repeatedly in the calculation, it can produce poor results for some problems. Hence using the result of the interval-valued Gauss only provides first rough estimates, since although it contains the entire solution set, it also has a large area outside it.\n\nA rough solution formula_52 can often be improved by an interval version of the Gauss–Seidel method.\nThe motivation for this is that the formula_101-th row of the interval extension of the linear equation\ncan be determined by the variable formula_157 if the division formula_158 is allowed. It is therefore simultaneously\nSo we can now replace formula_161 by\nand so the vector formula_52 by each element.\nSince the procedure is more efficient for a diagonally dominant matrix, instead of the system formula_164 one can often try multiplying it by an appropriate rational matrix formula_165 with the resulting matrix equation\nleft to solve. If one chooses, for example, formula_167 for the central matrix formula_147, then formula_169 is outer extension of the identity matrix.\n\nThese methods only work well if the widths of the intervals occurring are sufficiently small. For wider intervals it can be useful to use an interval-linear system on finite (albeit large) real number equivalent linear systems. If all the matrices formula_147 are invertible, it is sufficient to consider all possible combinations (upper and lower) of the endpoints occurring in the intervals. The resulting problems can be resolved using conventional numerical methods. Interval arithmetic is still used to determine rounding errors.\n\nThis is only suitable for systems of smaller dimension, since with a fully occupied formula_171 matrix, formula_172 real matrices need to be inverted, with formula_173 vectors for the right hand side. This approach was developed by Jiri Rohn and is still being developed.\n\nAn interval variant of Newton's method for finding the zeros in an interval vector formula_52 can be derived from the average value extension. For an unknown vector formula_175 applied to formula_176, gives\nFor a zero formula_178, that is formula_179, and thus must satisfy\nThis is equivalent to\nformula_181.\nAn outer estimate of formula_182 can be determined using linear methods.\n\nIn each step of the interval Newton method, an approximate starting value formula_183 is replaced by formula_184 and so the result can be improved iteratively. In contrast to traditional methods, the interval method approaches the result by containing the zeros. This guarantees that the result produces all zeros in the initial range. Conversely, it proves that no zeros of formula_7 were in the initial range formula_52 if a Newton step produces the empty set.\n\nThe method converges on all zeros in the starting region. Division by zero can lead to separation of distinct zeros, though the separation may not be complete; it can be complemented by the bisection method.\n\nAs an example, consider the function formula_187, the starting range formula_188, and the point formula_189. We then have formula_190 and the first Newton step gives\nMore Newton steps are used separately on formula_192 and formula_193. These converge to arbitrarily small intervals around formula_194 and formula_195.\n\nThe Interval Newton method can also be used with \"thick functions\" such as formula_196, which would in any case have interval results. The result then produces intervals containing formula_197.\n\nThe various interval methods deliver conservative results as dependencies between the sizes of different intervals extensions are not taken into account. However the dependency problem becomes less significant for narrower intervals.\n\nCovering an interval vector formula_52 by smaller boxes formula_199 so that\n\nis then valid for the range of values\n\nSo for the interval extensions described above the following holds:\n\nSince formula_203 is often a genuine superset of the right-hand side, this usually leads to an improved estimate.\n\nSuch a cover can be generated by the bisection method such as thick elements formula_204 of the interval vector formula_205 by splitting in the centre into the two intervals formula_206 and formula_207 If the result is still not suitable then further gradual subdivision is possible. A cover of formula_208 intervals results from formula_209 divisions of vector elements, substantially increasing the computation costs.\n\nWith very wide intervals, it can be helpful to split all intervals into several subintervals with a constant (and smaller) width, a method known as \"mincing\". This then avoids the calculations for intermediate bisection steps. Both methods are only suitable for problems of low dimension.\n\nInterval arithmetic can be used in various areas (such as set inversion, motion planning, set estimation or stability analysis) to treat estimates with no exact numerical value.\n\nInterval arithmetic is used with error analysis, to control rounding errors arising from each calculation.\nThe advantage of interval arithmetic is that after each operation there is an interval that reliably includes the true result. The distance between the interval boundaries gives the current calculation of rounding errors directly:\nInterval analysis adds to rather than substituting for traditional methods for error reduction, such as pivoting.\n\nParameters for which no exact figures can be allocated often arise during the simulation of technical and physical processes.\nThe production process of technical components allows certain tolerances, so some parameters fluctuate within intervals.\nIn addition, many fundamental constants are not known precisely.\n\nIf the behavior of such a system affected by tolerances satisfies, for example, formula_212, for formula_213 and unknown formula_107 then the set of possible solutions\ncan be found by interval methods. This provides an alternative to traditional propagation of error analysis.\nUnlike point methods, such as Monte Carlo simulation, interval arithmetic methodology ensures that no part of the solution area can be overlooked.\nHowever, the result is always a worst-case analysis for the distribution of error, as other probability-based distributions are not considered.\n\nInterval arithmetic can also be used with affiliation functions for fuzzy quantities as they are used in fuzzy logic. Apart from the strict statements formula_216 and formula_217, intermediate values are also possible, to which real numbers formula_218 are assigned. formula_219 corresponds to definite membership while formula_220 is non-membership. A distribution function assigns uncertainty, which can be understood as a further interval.\n\nFor \"fuzzy arithmetic\" only a finite number of discrete affiliation stages formula_221 are considered. The form of such a distribution for an indistinct value can then represented by a sequence of intervals\n\nThe interval formula_223 corresponds exactly to the fluctuation range for the stage formula_224\n\nThe appropriate distribution for a function formula_225 concerning indistinct values formula_226 and the corresponding sequences\n\ncan be approximated by the sequence\n\nwhere\n\nand can be calculated by interval methods. The value formula_230 corresponds to the result of an interval calculation.\n\nWarwick Tucker used interval arithmetic in order to solve the 14th of Smale's problems, that is, to show that the Lorenz attractor is a strange attractor. Thomas Hales used interval arithmetic in order to solve the Kepler conjecture.\n\nInterval arithmetic is not a completely new phenomenon in mathematics; it has appeared several times under different names in the course of history. For example, Archimedes calculated lower and upper bounds 223/71 < π < 22/7 in the 3rd century BC. Actual calculation with intervals has neither been as popular as other numerical techniques nor been completely forgotten.\n\nRules for calculating with intervals and other subsets of the real numbers were published in a 1931 work by Rosalind Cicely Young. Arithmetic work on range numbers to improve the reliability of digital systems were then published in a 1951 textbook on linear algebra by ; intervals were used to measure rounding errors associated with floating-point numbers. A comprehensive paper on interval algebra in numerical analysis was published by Teruo Sunaga (1958).\n\nThe birth of modern interval arithmetic was marked by the appearance of the book \"Interval Analysis\" by Ramon E. Moore in 1966. He had the idea in spring 1958, and a year later he published an article about computer interval arithmetic. Its merit was that starting with a simple principle, it provided a general method for automated error analysis, not just errors resulting from rounding.\n\nIndependently in 1956, Mieczyslaw Warmus suggested formulae for calculations with intervals, though Moore found the first non-trivial applications.\n\nIn the following twenty years, German groups of researchers carried out pioneering work around Ulrich W. Kulisch and at the University of Karlsruhe and later also at the Bergische University of Wuppertal.\nFor example, explored more effective implementations, while improved containment procedures for the solution set of systems of equations were due to Arnold Neumaier among others. In the 1960s, Eldon R. Hansen dealt with interval extensions for linear equations and then provided crucial contributions to global optimisation, including what is now known as Hansen's method, perhaps the most widely used interval algorithm. Classical methods in this often have the problem of determining the largest (or smallest) global value, but could only find a local optimum and could not find better values; Helmut Ratschek and Jon George Rokne developed branch and bound methods, which until then had only applied to integer values, by using intervals to provide applications for continuous values.\n\nIn 1988, Rudolf Lohner developed Fortran-based software for reliable solutions for initial value problems using ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe journal \"Reliable Computing\" (originally \"Interval Computations\") has been published since the 1990s, dedicated to the reliability of computer-aided computations. As lead editor, R. Baker Kearfott, in addition to his work on global optimisation, has contributed significantly to the unification of notation and terminology used in interval arithmetic.\n\nIn recent years work has concentrated in particular on the estimation of preimages of parameterised functions and to robust control theory by the COPRIN working group of INRIA in Sophia Antipolis in France.\n\nThere are many software packages that permit the development of numerical applications using interval arithmetic. These are usually provided in the form of program libraries. There are also C++ and Fortran compilers that handle interval data types and suitable operations as a language extension, so interval arithmetic is supported directly.\n\nSince 1967, \"Extensions for Scientific Computation\" (XSC) have been developed in the University of Karlsruhe for various programming languages, such as C++, Fortran and Pascal. The first platform was a Zuse Z23, for which a new interval data type with appropriate elementary operators was made available. There followed in 1976, Pascal-SC, a Pascal variant on a Zilog Z80 that it made possible to create fast, complicated routines for automated result verification. Then came the Fortran 77-based ACRITH-XSC for the System/370 architecture (FORTRAN-SC), which was later delivered by IBM. Starting from 1991 one could produce code for C compilers with Pascal-XSC; a year later the C++ class library supported C-XSC on many different computer systems. In 1997, all XSC variants were made available under the GNU General Public License. At the beginning of 2000 C-XSC 2.0 was released under the leadership of the working group for scientific computation at the Bergische University of Wuppertal to correspond to the improved C++ standard.\n\nAnother C++-class library was created in 1993 at the Hamburg University of Technology called \"Profil/BIAS\" (Programmer's Runtime Optimized Fast Interval Library, Basic Interval Arithmetic), which made the usual interval operations more user friendly. It emphasized the efficient use of hardware, portability and independence of a particular presentation of intervals.\n\nThe Boost collection of C++ libraries contains a template class for intervals. Its authors are aiming to have interval arithmetic in the standard C++ language.\n\nThe Frink programming language has an implementation of interval arithmetic that handles arbitrary-precision numbers. Programs written in Frink can use intervals without rewriting or recompilation.\n\nGaol is another C++ interval arithmetic library that is unique in that it offers the relational interval operators used in interval constraint programming.\n\nThe Moore library is an efficient implementation of interval arithmetic in C++. It provides intervals with endpoints of arbitrary precision and is based on the ``concepts´´ feature of C++.\n\nThe Julia programming language has an implementation of interval arithmetics along with high-level features, such as root-finding (for both real and complex-valued functions) and interval constraint programming, via the ValidatedNumerics.jl package.\n\nIn addition computer algebra systems, such as FriCAS, Mathematica, Maple, Maxima (software) and MuPAD, can handle intervals. A Matlab extension \"Intlab\" builds on BLAS routines, and the Toolbox b4m makes a Profil/BIAS interface. Moreover, the Software Euler Math Toolbox includes an interval arithmetic.\n\nA library for the functional language OCaml was written in assembly language and C.\n\nA standard for interval arithmetic has been approved in June 2015. Two reference implementations are freely available. These have been developed by members of the standard's working group: The libieeep1788 library for C++, and the interval package for GNU Octave.\n\nA minimal subset of the standard, IEEE Std 1788.1-2017, has been approved in December 2017 and published in February 2018. It should be easier to implement and may speed production of implementations.\n\nSeveral international conferences or workshop take place every year in the world. The main conference is probably SCAN (International Symposium on Scientific Computing, Computer Arithmetic, and Verified Numerical Computation), but there is also SWIM (Small Workshop on Interval Methods), PPAM (International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics), REC (International Workshop on Reliable Engineering Computing).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2176162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176162", "title": "Waking the Dead (TV series)", "text": "Waking the Dead (TV series)\n\nWaking the Dead is a British television police procedural crime drama series, produced by the BBC, that centres on a fictional London-based Cold Case unit composed of CID police officers, a psychological profiler and a forensic scientist. A pilot episode aired in September 2000, and a total of nine series followed. Each story is split into two hour-long episodes, shown on consecutive nights on BBC One. A third series episode won an International Emmy Award in 2004. The programme was also shown on BBC America in the United States, though these screenings are edited to allow for advertising breaks, as well as UKTV in Australia and New Zealand and ABC1 in Australia. The show aired its final episode on 11 April 2011. A spin-off from the series, titled \"The Body Farm\", revolving around forensic scientist Eve Lockhart (Tara Fitzgerald), was announced by the BBC in January 2011 and ran for just one series.\n\nIn 2018, a five-part radio prequel to the series, \"The Unforgiven\", was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, with Sue Johnston, Claire Goose, Wil Johnson and Holly Aird reprising their roles. All five episodes were written by series creator Barbara Machin.\n\nThe programme follows the work of a special police team that investigates \"cold cases\", which usually concern murders that took place a number of years ago, and were never solved. The team, composed of head officer Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd (Trevor Eve), psychological profiler Dr Grace Foley (Sue Johnston), Detective Inspector Spencer Jordan (Wil Johnson), as well as a number of other supporting characters, uses evidence which has recently come to light, as well as contemporary technology to examine former evidence.\n\nInitially, Boyd, Grace and Spence were accompanied by junior DC Mel Silver (Claire Goose), and stern forensic scientist Frankie Wharton (Holly Aird), however both left after the end of the fourth series. Felix Gibson (Esther Hall) and Stella Goodman (Felicite Du Jeu) replaced them in the fifth series, before Eve Lockhart (Tara Fitzgerald) replaced Felix from the sixth series onwards. Katarina Howard (Stacey Roca) replaced Stella in series eight, while Sarah Cavendish (Eva Birthistle) replaced Katarina in series nine. Although the plotlines generally centre around the case, other storylines have been incorporated across the years, including Boyd's anger management issues and his being re-united with his son, Grace suffering from cancer, Spencer being shot at the hands of one of his former colleagues, and Mel's death, which creates a chain of events lasting across two series.\n\nThe show also addressed sensitive issues such as fanaticism within different religions, international organised crime, child abuse within the Catholic Church, war crimes in Bosnia, forced child labour, torture, homophobia and racism. The BBC issued disclaimers twice on the show when it touched upon issues sensitive to the Labour government of the time (once about banking frauds within the City of London establishment and once about the involvement of the UK in the Iraq war). Some of the issues were dealt with through the conflicting views of Peter Boyd (a white middle-class liberal) and Spencer Jordan (a black working-class conservative).\n\nA total of 46 stories aired across the nine series.\n\n\"The Body Farm\", a spin-off revolving around forensic scientist Eve Lockhart (Tara Fitzgerald), produced by Trevor Eve and made by his production company Projector, was commissioned by the BBC. However, after poor ratings and reviews, it was cancelled after one series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first series secured strong ratings, with \"Burn Out\" receiving 8.4 million viewers and a 38% audience share. Persistently high ratings meant the programme was recommissioned each year for either the summer or winter schedule. The sixth series began with strong ratings, with \"Wren Boys\" achieving 9.2 m viewers and a 35.2% audience share. The second part dropped to 8.6 m, but still gained a 33% audience share. Following the successful transmission of the third series and an International Emmy Award nomination for \"Special Relationship\" written by Stephen Davis and directed by David Thacker, a further two series were commissioned with the number of stories expanded from four to six. \"Waking the Dead\" won an International Emmy Award the following year for \"Breaking Glass\", written by Stephen Davis and directed by Maurice Phillips, and \"Multistorey\", written by Ed Whitmore and directed by Bob Bierman.\n\nAll nine series have been released on DVD in the United Kingdom via 2 Entertain Ltd, under the \"BBC DVD\" banner. All nine series are also available in a complete boxset. Series one to seven have been released by BBC Video in the United States, while all nine series have been released in Australia via Roadshow.\n\n\n"}

Creative artists, including the Beatles, opera singer Maria Callas, and painter Pablo Picasso – representing nineteen nations – were invited to perform or appear in separate segments featuring their respective countries. The two-and-a-half-hour event had the largest television audience ever up to that date: an estimated 400 to 700 million people around the globe watched the broadcast. Today, it is most famous for the segment from the United Kingdom starring the Beatles. They performed their song \"All You Need Is Love\" for the first time to close the broadcast.\n\nThe project was conceived by BBC producer Aubrey Singer. It was transferred to the European Broadcasting Union, but the master control room for the broadcast was still at the BBC in London. The satellites used were Intelsat I (known as \"Early Bird\"), Intelsat 2-2 (\"Lani Bird\"), Intelsat 2–3 (\"Canary Bird\"), and NASA's ATS-1.\n\nIt took ten months to bring everything together. The Eastern Bloc countries, headed by the Soviet Union, pulled out four days before the broadcast in protest of the Western nations' response to the Six-Day War.\n\nThe ground rules included that no politicians or heads of state could participate in the broadcast. In addition, everything had to be \"live\", so no use of videotape or film was permitted. Ten thousand technicians, producers and interpreters took part in the broadcast. Each country had its own announcers, due to language issues, and interpreters voiced over the original sound when not in a country's native language. Fourteen countries participated in the production, which was transmitted to 24 countries, with an estimated audience of between 400 and 700 million people.\n\n, , , the and withdrew before the broadcast, in protest of the Six-Day War.\n\nThe opening credits were accompanied by the Our World theme sung in 22 different languages by the Vienna Boys' Choir.\n\nCanada's CBC Television had Marshall McLuhan being interviewed in a Toronto television control room. At 7:17 pm GMT, the show switched to the United States' segment about the Glassboro, New Jersey conference between American president Lyndon Johnson and Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin; since \"Our World\" insisted that no politicians be shown, only the house where the conference was being held was televised. National Educational Television's (NET) Dick McCutcheon ended up talking about the impact of the new television technology on a global scale.\n\nThe show switched back to Canada at 7:18 pm GMT. Segments that were beamed worldwide were from a Ghost Lake, Alberta ranch, showing a rancher, and his cutting horse, cutting out a herd of cattle. The last Canadian segment was from Kitsilano Beach, located in Vancouver's Point Grey district at 7:19 pm GMT.\n\nAt 7:20 pm GMT, the program shifted continents to Asia, with Tokyo, Japan being the next segment. It was 4:20 a.m. local time and NHK showed the construction of the Tokyo subway system.\n\nThe equator was crossed for the first time in the program when it switched to the Australian contributions, which was at 5:22 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). This was the most technically complicated point in the broadcast, as both the Japanese and Australian satellite ground stations had to reverse their actions: Tokyo had to go from transmit mode to receive mode, while Melbourne had to switch from receive to transmit mode. The first segment dealt with trams leaving the South Melbourne tram depot with Australian Broadcasting Commission's Brian King explaining that sunrise was many hours away as it was winter there. Two scientific segments, later on in the broadcast, were also included; one, presented from Canberra by the ABC's Eric Hunter showed experiments being carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to extend the frequency of cereal crop cycles, while the second dealt with the Parkes Observatory tracking a deep space object.\n\nThe broadcast took place at the height of the Vietnam War. The Beatles were asked to write a song with a positive message. At 8:54 GMT the Beatles topped the event with their debut performance of \"All You Need Is Love\". The Beatles invited many of their friends to the event to create a festive atmosphere and to join in on the song's chorus. Among the friends were members of the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Moon and Graham Nash.\n\nAlthough the program was originally recorded and transmitted in black-and-white, for its use in the 1995 TV special \"The Beatles Anthology\", the Beatles' performance on the 1967 program was colourised, using colour photographs taken at the event as a reference. The sequence opens in its original monochromatic format and rapidly morphs into full colour, conveying the brightly coloured flower power and psychedelic-style clothing worn by the Beatles and their guests that was popular during what was subsequently dubbed the \"Summer of Love\".\n\nIn the novel \"The Light of Other Days\" by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter, the global media empire run by Hiram Patterson is called OurWorld, the name chosen after the character saw the program as a child and was inspired to change the world.\n"}

The route connects Dublin and Waterford. The section of the route from junction 11 on the M7 at Kilcullen to the intersection with the N24 road outside Waterford is motorway standard since 2010 and is designated as the M9 motorway. In line with Irish practice, all sections previously designated N9 were renumbered at that time. Only a short (550-metre) section of the route is still designated as N9 between the Quarry roundabout junction with the N24 and the N25 Grannagh Roundabout junction. This section is dual carriageway.\n\nThe route starts as motorway southwest of Newbridge (see thumbnail), and on the southwest side of Kilcullen. Prior to the 1993 opening of the Newbridge bypass, the N9 had run from Naas (east of the current M9). The previous route is now the R448.\n\nThe previous route continued south through Kilgowan, the intersection with the N78 to Athy, Ballitore, the R747, Timolin, Moone and through Castledermot in County Kildare. This is currently bypassed by the Kilcullen to Carlow section of the M9 opened in December 2009. This then joins with another stretch of motorway, opened 29 May 2008 bypassing Carlow, meeting the R448 at a junction near Powerstown. Further south, the M9 crosses the River Barrow bypassing Leighlinbridge to the west, and continuing south to pass west of Muine Bheag (Bagnelstown), then entering County Kilkenny.\n\nAt Paulstown the N10 diverges west/southwest to serve Kilkenny and the present section of the M9. The M9 bypasses Gowran, Dungarvan and Thomastown. This section of the N9 opened as motorway in September 2010 and completed the M9 motorway. Motorists join the M9 via the N10 from Kilkenny onto the M9 section from Danesfort to Waterford. From Powerstown and further on, just north of Ballyhale the former N10 rejoins the R448, having proceeded south from Kilkenny. Lukeswell, Mullinavat and Dunkitt lie along the R448 route south towards Waterford. The M9 ends at the Quarry roundabout junction with the N24. A short section of the route designated as N9 continues towards the Granagh interchange where the route terminates and intersects with the N25 Waterford bypass.\n\nThe National Development Plan included plans for a motorway from Dublin to Waterford. While these plans were later altered to High Quality Dual Carriageway, in July 2008 the road was reclassified as a motorway once more. An environmental impact assessment was published in October 2003 and a CPO issued in November 2003 for the dual-carriageway forming the northern part of the Kilcullen–Waterford route, from Kilcullen, County Kildare to Powerstown, County Carlow. An EIS was published and a CPO issued in February 2005 for the southern section of the upgraded route, from Powerstown to Waterford.\n\nThe southern section of route differs more from the former N9 alignment than most of the national road upgrade projects in recent years. The N10 provides a link to Kilkenny, to the west of the M9. The new alignment of the M9 passes further west, closer to Kilkenny, with a new shorter N10 link to the M9 on the northeast side of Kilkenny. The N10 remains as far as Danesfort for the link southeast of Kilkenny. The timeline of upgrades to the former N9 route was:\n\n\nA bypass of Waterford was opened in 2009, as part of the N25 that previously passed southeast/northwest through the city. As part of the project, the new M9 joins at a roundabout just off the Granagh Interchange which then allows access to Waterford City or the bypass to Rosslare/Cork.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2176203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176203", "title": "Annalists", "text": "Annalists\n\nAnnalists (from Latin \"annus\", year; hence \"annales\", sc. \"libri\", annual records), were a class of writers on Roman history, the period of whose literary activity lasted from the time of the Second Punic War to that of Sulla. They wrote the history of Rome from the earliest times (in most cases) down to their own days, the events of which were treated in much greater detail. Annalists were different from historians, in that an annalist was more likely to just record events for reference purposes, rather than offering their own opinions of events. There is, however, some overlap between the two categories and sometimes annalist is used to refer to both styles of writing from the Roman era.\n\nFor the earlier period, the authorities of annalists were to record state and family records—above all, the \"annales maximi\" (or \"annales pontificum\"), the official chronicle of Rome, in which the notable occurrences of each year from the foundation of the city were set down by the Pontifex Maximus. Although these annals were no doubt destroyed at the time of the burning of Rome by the Gauls, they were restored as far as possible and continued until the pontificate of P. Mucius Scaevola, by whom they were finally published in eighty books.\n\nTwo generations of these annalists have been distinguished—an older and a younger. The older, which extends to 150 BCE, set forth, in bald, unattractive language, without any pretensions to style, but with a certain amount of trustworthiness, the most important events of each successive year. Cicero (\"De Oratore\", ii. 12. 53), comparing these writers with the old Ionic logographers, says that they paid no attention to ornament, and considered the only merits of a writer to be intelligibility and conciseness. Their annals were a mere compilation of facts.\n\nThe younger generation, in view of the requirements and criticism of a reading public, cultivated the art of composition and rhetorical embellishment. As a general rule the annalists wrote in a spirit of uncritical patriotism, which led them to minimize or gloss over such disasters as the conquest of Rome by Porsena and the compulsory payment of ransom to the Gauls, and to flatter the people by exaggerated accounts of Roman prowess, dressed up in fanciful language. At first they wrote in Greek, partly because a national style was not yet formed, and partly because Greek was the fashionable language amongst the educated, although Latin versions were probably published as well.\n\nThe first of the annalists, the father of Roman history, as he has been called, was Q. Fabius Pictor; contemporary with him was Lucius Cincius Alimentus, who flourished during the Hannibalic war (not to be confused with L. Cincius, the author of various political and antiquarian treatises (\"de Fastis, de Comitiis, de Priscis Verbis\"), who lived in the Augustan age, to which period Mommsen, considering them a later fabrication, refers the Greek annals of L. Cincius Alimentus). Like Fabius Pictor, he wrote in Greek. He was taken prisoner by Hannibal (Livy xxi. 38), who is said to have given him details of the crossing of the Alps. His work embraced the history of Rome from its foundation down to his own days. With M. Porcius Cato historical composition in Latin began, and a livelier interest was awakened in the history of Rome.\n\nAmong the principal writers of this class who succeeded Cato, the following may be mentioned:\n\nThe writers mentioned dealt with Roman history as a whole; some of the annalists, however, confined themselves to shorter periods:\n\n"}

It reached number five on the UK Singles Chart and in Finland and Norway. It was also a top-twenty hit in Iceland, Ireland, Spain and Sweden and reached number 39 in New Zealand.\n\nThe band re-emerged with this successful electronic-rock tune after nearly two years away from the public eye. For the first time, synthesizers are used as a primary part of a song, working in parallel with the distorted guitar as opposed to just providing backing. The single helped guide the band's new direction, as evident in the fact that synths were also heavily used on \"Head Music\". According to the song's co-writer Neil Codling, it is \"hard-edged, spiky and more like the last album than anything else on this one.\" According to singer Brett Anderson, it is just a \"simple love song.\" On the choice of the album's lead single, he said: \"it was either going to be this or ‘Savoir Faire’. There are about five singles on the album, so in the end I couldn’t really tell which one should be first. It was pretty much flip a coin or roll some dice.\" However, there was in fact another contender for first single. Both \"Electricity\" and the title track \"Head Music\" were played to Sony A&R personnel around the world, who voted in favour of what they felt was the \"safer\" choice in \"Electricity\". The latter track ultimately was not chosen as a single from the album. \"Electricity\" was produced by Steve Osborne, \"Popstar\" and \"See That Girl\" were produced by Ben Hillier while \"Waterloo\" was produced by Bruce Lampcov.\n\nThe song was first performed live at a fanclub gig on 22 March 1999 at the Glasgow Garage; the band's first show since their Reading Festival appearance in 1997. Suede played at another fanclub show on 27 March at the London Astoria, with Black Box Recorder as the warm-up act. At the interval, the music video was premiered to a large gathering of the music media in attendance. To promote the single, the band performed the song on several TV shows, including: the \"Pepsi Chart\", \"Top of the Pops\", \"\". The single received exposure on Radio One's A-list four weeks in advance of release. On the day after its April 12 release, \"Electricity\" was holding up well at number two on the UK Singles Chart, behind Martine McCutcheon's \"Perfect Moment\". By the end of the week it had slipped to its official peak of number five, and it went on to spend a total of seven weeks on the chart. \"Electricity\" would be Suede's last top-ten single in the United Kingdom. As part of a major marketing push for the 3 May album release, the single was chosen as the first ever MiniDisc single to be released in the UK.\n\nThe video shoot for \"Electricity\" took place on 10 March and was directed by Mike Lipscombe. One of the band's few big budget videos, it features the band performing in the back alley Falconberg Court behind the London Astoria venue, ghosting in and out of view as electrical power lines surge and shower sparks over scene. The director made use of miniature models, rotoscoping and heavy post-production to achieve the final, big production look. Alluding to the comparisons in Suede’s music to David Bowie, a \"New Zealand Herald\" writer noted the similarity of the video's setting to the cover of Bowie’s 1972 \"Ziggy Stardust\" album; which also features a W1 London cul-de-sac.\n\nReviews to the highly-awaited single were mixed. \"The Mirror\" and \"Music Week\" declared it ‘Single of the Week’. The former said \"The boy wonder [Anderson] clearly hasn't lost his eye for a glam-trash chorus,” while the latter called it \"a rock-charged stomper that compromises on nothing and promises everything for the album.\" In a more mixed assessment, \"NME\" felt that Suede were displaying familiar music and lyrical ideas from the previous album, however they said the \"recycled cut-and-paste Suede is still a fair old mince ahead of most other singles you'll hear this year.\" However, some Scottish critics felt that the single was lacking creativity. The \"Daily Record\" wrote: \"Loyal Suede fans have put Brett Anderson's band back in the Top 10, but 'Electricity' lacks the energy of previous hits.\" Likewise, \"The List\" wrote: \"'Electricity' finds Suede treading water when they should be breaking new ground.\"\n\nCassette\n\nCD1\n\nCD2\n\nMiniDisc\n"}
{"id": "2176214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176214", "title": "Tubing (recreation)", "text": "Tubing (recreation)\n\nTubing (also known as inner tubing, bumper tubing, towed tubing (Kite Tubing) or just tubing) is a recreational activity where an individual rides on top of an inner tube, either on water, snow, or through the air. The tubes themselves are also known as \"donuts\" or \"biscuts\" due to their shape.\n\nTubing on water generally consists of two forms: towed and free-floating, also known as river tubing. There is also water skiing. According to \"Time Magazine\", tubing was purportedly invented in Thailand by Princes Chumbhot of Nagar Svarga sometime in the middle of the 20th century, but examples of the practice were published as early as 1916, when the popularization of the automobile meant a large supply of rubber inner tubes was available to the general public.\n\nTowed tubing usually takes place on a large body of water such as a lake or river. One or more tube riders (often called \"tubers\") tether their tubes to a powered watercraft such as a motor boat or a personal watercraft. The riders are then towed through the water by the watercraft.\n\nIn free floating tubing, the tube riders are untethered and often conveyed by the current of a waterway. Tubers paddle with their hands and often use webbed gloves to steer. Tubes can be outfitted with tube covers or 'skins'. These covers are fabric, and cover the bottom of the tube, the sides, and have a skirt that covers the inner diameter, while leaving room for the tuber to sit. Covers can be altered with pockets, can holders and have handles for the tuber to hold on to. It is strongly discouraged to tie anything to the tube or use ropes of any kind as a tuber can get bound or wrapped in them and potentially drown. The Esopus Creek in the Catskill Mountains, New York is a common place for tubing, starting in Phoenicia and proceeding eastward. As in all watersports tubers should wear appropriate safety gear such as life vests, protective water shoes and helmets. Whitewater tubing can be fun and exhilarating, the size of the tube allows a tuber to ride the river in an unencumbered manner not found in rafting or kayaking. Tubers can employ the use of such items as dry boxes and mesh bags to carry small personal items and pack out trash, cans and bottles from their trip.\n\nPopular riverside tube rentals normally warn against glass due to riverside dangers. Some law enforcement offices have prohibited kegs which were popularly chilled in metal tubs harnessed within larger tubes.\n\nMajor water parks often have specially designed courses for tubing called lazy rivers. These may consist of a circular, artificial river on which riders are conveyed or a linear course such as a water slide.\n\nSnow tubing is rumored to have begun as far back as the 1820s in the Alpine Mountains. Tubing on snow is a wintertime activity that is similar to sledding. This kind of tubing is almost always performed on a hill or slope, using gravity to propel the rider to the bottom of the grade. The rider often returns to the top of the slope with the tube to repeat the process. The low amount of friction between most tubes and snow allows tubers to reach considerable speeds while riding, especially on steep slopes. Because of the circular shape of snow tubes, controlling the course and speed of a tube while riding on snow is extremely difficult. While a sled rider can drag their arms on the snow to brake or steer to a degree, attempting this on a tube will often cause the tube to spin. This lack of control has led to injuries, some serious, when riders have struck obstacles such as trees while tubing on snow.\n\nSome ski resorts offer courses devoted solely to tubing. Such courses often have slopes or barriers on the periphery to guide the tubes along a safe course. Motorized pulley towlines are often used to tow riders and their tube back to the top of the course after riding to the bottom. Adventure Point At Keystone Resort in Colorado offers snow tubing late into the summer .Their elevation has been known to provide enough snow to last through the month of July. Steamboat Springs, Colorado ski mountain offers night snow tubing in ski season.\n\nIt is also possible to tow a tube through the snow behind a snowmobile. This is similar to towed tubing on water, only the watercraft is replaced by a snowmobile and the water with snow-covered ground.\n\nA variant of towed tubing dubbed \"kite tubing\" has begun to emerge.\n\nWhen tubes being towed on water reach high speeds, they may take flight. This is because the body of the tube acts as an airfoil and creates lift. In this way, the tube becomes a kite. A tube's ability to achieve and maintain flight depends on a number of factors including the speed at which the tube is traveling, the shape and size of the tube, the weight of the rider, and how the tube itself is oriented. As most tubes are not designed for flight, the rider often has little or no control over a tube after it takes to the air. This can lead to a violent crash as the rider, with or without the tube, falls back to the surface of the water.\n\nTo address the poor flight characteristics of most tubes and to target thrill seekers, tubes specially designed for kite tubing have been introduced. These tubes may feature channels to allow air to flow through the tube's body, a transparent \"window\" for the rider to signal the boat operator, as well as more streamlined, aerodynamic designs.\n\nAs of July 2006, 39 injuries and two deaths from kite tubing have been reported. Injuries have included a broken neck, punctured lung, cracked ribs, a concussion and injuries to the chest, back and face. Some accidents have been linked to gusts of wind that unexpectedly altered the flight characteristics and ejected the riders.\n\nIn cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Sportsstuff Inc. voluntarily withdrew the Wego Kite Tube from the market on , 2006.\n\nRelated to kite tubing is the kited inflated wing, a stiffened, flexible wing or gas-inflated bladder wing, where a control bar is affixed for the kited person to direct the inflated wing so the dangerous lock-out does not occur. The kited person can have a quick disconnect to release from a towing boat or car if a dangerous angle of tow begins.\n\nSummer tubing is the summer variant of snow tubing. Hard bottom tubes slide down artificial slopes, usually made of special plastic. They can be installed on mountains by ski resorts or you can find them also in amusement parks. In Europe produced by Neveplast, Tubingsystem and Mr. Snow.\n\nTubing can require varying pieces and kinds of equipment depending on the variety of tubing one wishes to engage in.\n\nThe one common piece of equipment across all forms of tubing is the tube itself. While tubes vary in construction, all share the general characteristics of being:\n\nTubes for use as towables on water are generally not true inner tubes but rather specially designed tubes for the purpose of recreation. These tubes are often fairly durable and come in either donut or disk shapes. A sleeve of synthetic fabric often covers the tube to prevent it from becoming elongated during towing. Such sleeves commonly have handles for the rider to grasp and an anchoring point for the tow line to be attached at.\n\nTowing a tube or tubes also requires a powered watercraft such a motorboat or personal watercraft as well as rope to tether the tubes to such craft.\n\nTubes used for free-floating tubing have traditionally been true inner tubes, but commercially sold tubes for the same purpose are becoming common place. These tubes are almost always donut-shaped to allow the rider to sit comfortably on their back across the top of the tube with buttocks in the center. This kind of tube rarely has handles or a sleeve and would perform poorly as a towable. Another type of water tube has a wooden panel inserted across the hole in the middle of the tube to prevent rocks in the river popping up into the tube and injuring the rider in shallow water areas.\n\nTubes used for riding on snow are sometimes specially designed tubes with dimpled centers rather than a \"donut\" hole. This prevents the rider and the tube itself from dragging on the snow. Snow tubes may be designed to have handles.\n\nThere are many dangers that are associated with tubing regardless of the variation of tubing.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2009, towed tubing injuries saw injuries increase at a rate of 250%. This amounted to 7,216 injuries alone in 2009. The increase in injuries is a result of the increase in popularity of the recreational activity. As a result, it is important that proper safety measures are in place. Proper inflation of the tube is especially important. This prevents the body from being caught between the tube and nylon cover that goes over it. With an underinflated tube it is possible for the rider to be caught and dragged under water. Towed tubing also provides dangers if not performed in an open area away from other obstacles such as docks, piers, and other boaters. Injuries can further occur during the ride. In kids, one study found injuries to the head to be common while adults suffered sprains to the knees. This discrepancy between age groups is believed to be a result of younger riders trying to fit more than one person on a tube. There is still danger after riders are flown from the tube. If the boat operator does not disengage the motor when picking up a tube rider from the water, there is a chance that the body of the person in the water could get caught in the motor. This can cause body disfigurement or even death depending on the severity of the injury and the time until proper medical attention is received.\n\nDangers still exist for water tubing that is not towed tubing. Non-towed water tubing takes place at a slower rate than towed tubing. As a result, tubers are more at risk of water dangers. For instance, insects such as ants and water moccasins have been known to attack tubers. The surrounding terrain of the water can also present their own dangers. Rapids can eject a rider from their tube causing them to land to rocks or other terrain. Non-towed tubing is often an all day thing, so things such as sunburns also present a risk. Furthermore, people often engage in excessive drinking leading to a state of drunkenness that can pose a danger to other tubers and to themselves as alcohol poisoning is common at some popular tubing locations.\n\nSnow tubing incidents are also becoming increasingly common. The common cause of the incidents is blunt force trauma as a result of the rider colliding into a fixed object at high speeds. This frequently results in head and neck injuries. Due to the location of these injuries, death is not uncommon as was seen in 2015 when a snow-tube rider fatally collided with a light pole.\n\n\n\n \"River tubing in Slovenia: Marble trout river tubing, Soča river\", Kata adventures, July 4, 2016, accessed July 4, 2016.\n\n"}

Seizing Koumbi Saleh, the capital of the recently defunct Ghana Empire, Soumaoro Kanté proceeded to conquer several neighboring states, including the Mandinka people in what is now Mali. However, the Mandinka prince Sundiata Keita built a coalition of smaller kingdoms to oppose him at the Battle of Kirina (c. 1235.), defeating the Sosso and leaving Sundiata's new Mali Empire dominant in the region.\n\nSoumaoro Kanté is portrayed as a villainous sorcerer-king in the national epic of Mali, the Epic of Sundiata. After his defeat at Kirina, he flees into the mountains of Koulikoro, where he \"disappears\" after being shot with only weapon to which he is vulnerable - an arrow with a white rooster crest on it. In the Epic of Sundiata, Soumaoro Kanté is described as owning a balafon with magical powers, which is stolen by Sundiata Keita's djeli, Balafasseke Kouyate, and brought to Manden. This is the origin of the Manden djeli tradition of balafon playing. The balafon of Soumaoro Kanté is said to be kept by the Kouyate family to this day in the village of Niagassola in Guinea.\n\nSoumaoro is viewed as one of the true champions of Traditional African religion due to his reputation in the epic as someone possessing extraordinary magical powers.

{"id": "2176252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176252", "title": "She's in Fashion", "text": "She's in Fashion\n\n\"She's in Fashion\" is the second single from the album \"Head Music\" by Suede. It was released on 21 June 1999 and peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart, number 10 in Finland, and number 59 in Sweden.\n\nA swirling synth line helps build the song into a dreamy, uptempo track, quite unlike anything the band had previously made. \"NME\" said the song \"features oriental-type keyboards, and sounds like a cross between pop David Bowie and The Chi-Lites.\" \"She's in Fashion\" has been described as \"the most summery-sounding pop song Suede have recorded.\" Obtaining this sound required months of heavy production work, several re-recordings and a lot of experimentation. Cowriter and keyboardist Neil Codling said the song was recorded in four different styles, \"to have that summer feel.\" \n\n\"It happens quite often that you go on a journey, attempt various things and end up preferring the first thing you did,\" agreed producer Steve Osborne. \"'Fashion' was a song that we started in the first week of recording -- but we didn't finish it until the very last week!\"\n\nThe band played the song live for the first time on \"TFI Friday\" on 4 June 1999. The single was released on 21 June and failed to make the UK top ten, peaking at number 13, thus breaking a run of six consecutive top-ten singles. It slid quickly out the charts, only spending six weeks in the top 100. It was also the group's last top-ten hit in Finland; a country where the singles from \"Coming Up\" had performed very well. Although it did not make the UK top ten, it received the most commercial airplay from Suede's discography. Saul Galpern of Nude Records said that \"She's in Fashion\" was Suede's biggest radio hit. However this exposure on the airwaves failed to transfer into sales and Galpern felt perhaps it should have been the first single. The single amassed unprecedented airplay for a hitherto indie band. Radio One and Atlantic 252, both played it 22 times the week before its release date. Zoe Ball, then presenting \"Radio 1 Breakfast\", made it her Single of the Week, possibly associating with the song’s opening lyrics: \"She's the face on the radio, she's the body on the morning show.\" Lead singer Brett Anderson said: \"It did open us up to a mainstream that we hadn't been open to before... 'She's in Fashion' is probably our most famous song in a funny sort of way.\"\n\nThe video for the title song was directed by Johan Renck, and features Anderson riding in a car, focusing on a woman who re-appears outside in a different setting with different clothing. She is seen throwing out her garbage, taking her dog for a walk, standing among a flower field, sitting on a tree. She appears eleven times in different clothing. At the end of the video, Anderson turns his head to his right, and the girl is sitting next to him in the back seat. The video was filmed on the route from Eastbourne to London.\n\nThe song was well-received by critics, who welcomed the song's pop sound. \"Select\" declared it 'Single of the Month', writing: “Like ‘Electricity’ before it, ‘She’s in Fashion’ is gloriously shallow pop music. With a keyboard figure from a Tunisian tourist-board ad, it’s about as summery as getting pissed at the fairground.\" \"NME\" liked the music, saying: \"Soused in acoustic guitar'd empathy, with a vaporous keyboard motif inescapably reminiscent of Duran Duran's 'Save A Prayer', 'She's In Fashion' is a balmy, barmy beaut, shimmering grooves turning a blithe eye to the world.\" \"Music Week\" said it was \"classic Suede - one of their best songs since 'Animal Nitrate'... It's a string-swept, breezy, car-roof-down-driving-around-the-French-Riviera number.\" In a more mixed assessment, \"The Times\" spoke favourably of the song's production, while criticising Anderson's lyrics, saying \"it coasts along breezily on a wave of strings and synths that owe more than a passing nod to the Eighties electronica of bands such as the Human League. The feelgood, hands-in-the-air chorus is refreshingly upbeat after the tinny jangle of their last album, \"Coming Up\", and the deliciously summery fade-out also scores extra brownie points. The only drawback, predictably, is Brett Anderson's unintentionally hilarious lyrics, full of the same tired old Suede reference points.\"\n\nCassette\n\nCD1\n\nCD2\n"}
