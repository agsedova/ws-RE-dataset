Guest; commissioned 15 December 1942, Commander Henry Crommelin in command. \"Guest\" decommissioned in 1946 and was transferred on loan to the Brazilian Navy in 1959, where she served as \"Pará\" (D27). She was stricken in 1979 and was sunk as a target ship in 1983.\n\nAfter shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay, \"Guest\" made a cruise to Trinidad with aircraft carrier \"Independence\" (CVL-22). This was followed by a convoy escort voyage from New York to Casablanca and return to Boston (28 April – 31 May 1943). She departed Boston 20 July for brief training in Hawaiian waters, then joined the 3rd Fleet 28 August at Efate, New Hebrides Islands. After an offensive sweep to the Santa Cruz Islands and several escort missions to Nouméa, New Caledonia, she departed Efate 28 October for invasion of Bougainville. She guarded transports during the initial landings 1 November assisting in shooting down two enemy bombers. In the following months she escorted troop and logistic convoys from Guadalcanal to Cape Torokina, twice driving off bombers and torpedo planes which attacked her convoy. She silenced Japanese coastal defense guns at Motupene Point, Bougainville, 4 December 1943, and bombarded the Saba River area 25 January 1944.\n\n\"Guest\" protected transports landing the Marine Raiders on Green Island 31 January 1944. As the Raiders reembarked the next morning, she made two depth charge attacks on a diving submarine. \"Hudson\" (DD-475) followed up this attack to complete the kill of the 1,400-ton Japanese submarine \"I-171\". \"Guest\" again screened transports during invasion of the Green Islands 15 February 1944. She bombarded Kavieng, New Ireland 25 February, and the Sanba River area on Bougainville 17 March. She rescued the crew of \"PT-63\" on the latter date. In a case of mistaken identity on 17 March motor torpedo boat PT-283 was sunk by friendly fire from destroyer Guest (DD-472), in the Solomons, near Choseul Island. Her 5-inch gunfire destroyed the grounded Japanese freighter \"Meisyo Maru\" 30 April to the east of Nemto Island. After amphibious assault training in the New Hebrides, she departed from Roi, in the Marshall Islands, 10 June 1944 for the invasion and capture of the Mariana Islands.\n\n\"Guest\" poured gunfire ahead of troops landing on Saipan 15 June 1944, then helped repel four massive air raids against Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. She also conducted pre-invasion bombardment of Guam and gave direct gunfire support to the landings on Guam 21 July 1944. She remained on bombardment support and patrol stations until 9 August, then sailed for amphibious warfare exercises in the Solomons.\n\n\"Guest\" departed Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, 6 September 1944. A unit of Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf's Western Fire Support group, she bombarded Anguar in the Palau Islands 12 September 1944. The following day she rescued 7 officers and 45 men of destroyer \"Perry\" (DMS-17), which hit a mine and sank off Anguar. \"Guest\" departed the area 25 September and entered San Francisco Bay 25 October 1944 for overhaul.\n\nOverhaul was followed by training in Hawaiian waters until 27 January 1945 when she departed with a task group bound via the Marianas for Iwo Jima. Her 5-inch guns blasted that island during the initial invasion 19 February 1945. She continued gunfire support until 28 February when she sailed to join the screen of escort carriers in San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands.\n\n\"Guest\" departed San Pedro Bay 27 March to guard escort carriers giving direct support to the invasion of Okinawa. Detached 9 May, she was assigned to antiaircraft defense station in the Okinawas western transport area. The night of 25 May a kamikaze suicide plane glanced off her mast and crashed alongside to portside, causing damage to the stack. She remained on antiaircraft defense station until 1 July 1945. She was then routed via Ulithi and the Marshalls in the screen of escort carriers bound to Adak, Alaska, thence to Ominato, Japan. After plane guard duty with carriers along the coast of Honshū, she returned via Adak to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 15 November 1945.\n\n\"Guest\" decommissioned at San Diego 4 June 1946 and remained in reserve until transferred 5 June 1959 on loan to the government of Brazil.\n\nThe ship served in the Brazilian Navy as \"Pará\" (D27). She was stricken in 1979. After decommissioning she was used during 1982 and 1983 as a target ship for gunnery and torpedo practice and for Exocet MM 38 anti-ship missiles launched by the Brazilian frigate \"Niterói\" (F 40). On 23 February 1983, she was sunk by two torpedoes fired by the Brazilian submarine \"Ceará (S 14)\" in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brazil approximately 80 nautical miles (148 km) south of Cabo Frio lighthouse.\n\n\"Guest\" received eight battle stars for service in World War II.\n\n"}

It is likely to be replaced with a ferry between the two countries beginning in 2017.\n\nDue to the Qatar diplomatic crisis and Bahrain’s siding with Saudi Arabia, the bridge is very unlikely ever to be built.\n\nIt was announced on 13 December 2008 that construction would start in early 2009, and would cost approximately US$2.3 billion to complete. As of June 2015, construction had not started, and the Qatar-Bahrain Causeway project was on hold, while the contracting consortium involved with the project was said to be demobilising, according to a source at the Qatar Bahrain Causeway Foundation (QBCF). On 14 January 2011, Bahrain's Foreign Minister stated that the project should nevertheless be considered as a must for both countries: \"This is one economic market, one economic zone that should be well-connected, and the bridge is an integral part of that\". On 27 April 2011, an announcement was made, quoting an anonymous source of Bahrain's Al Wasat newspaper, that construction of the causeway would start in 2011 for completion in 2015, at the cost of approximately $5 billion. By December 2012, Bahrain's Foreign Minister was invoking financial turbulence to say that the bridge construction would only be completed by \"a little before the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\" \n\nThe link between the two countries would be approximately in length, and support both a road and a railway. The link was expected to consist of a number of bridges and be a natural extension of the King Fahd Causeway that connects Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, thus linking the entire region. These links include of artificial dikes and of viaducts and bridges. These bridges would be in height at places to allow maritime navigation. The eastern-end of the causeway in Qatar would be located at Ras Ashairij, South of the city of Zubarah. The opposite end of the causeway would link North of Askar in the Kingdom of Bahrain. \n\nPlans for its construction were first made in September 2001, when the Danish consultancy COWI signed a DKK 60 million contract for the first phase of the project with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture in Qatar. Together with Sund & Bælt Partner Ltd., DHI Water & Environment and the architects of Dissing Weitling and COWI conducted pre-studies of the link.\n\nThe project was reportedly approved for construction on 28 February 2005, to link Bahrain near Manama to northwest Qatar near Zubarah as the longest fixed link in the world. A formal agreement between the two countries was signed on 11 June 2006 to form a company that would raise the necessary capital and initiate construction.\n\nIt was announced on 30 September 2007 that construction should start within seven months and last 48 months. A memorandum of understanding to that effect was then signed between the Qatar and Bahrain Causeway Foundation and a consortium of companies led by French construction major Vinci Construction and the German Company Hochtief Construction AG, CCC and Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company.\n\nOn 15 November 2008, the Qatar-Bahrain Causeway Foundation awarded a contract to KBR, an engineering company headquartered in Houston, \"\"to provide design, project and construction management services for the Qatar-Bahrain road and rail marine crossing\"\".\n\nIn 2009, discussions were entered into to soften the gradient of the bridge to make it more suitable for rail traffic. French architects Thomas Lavigne and Christophe Cheron joined the consortium led by Vinci to design, in collaboration with the engineers, the Causeway and the two main bridges.\n\nIn May 2010, Qatari coastguards injured a Bahraini fisherman reigniting a dispute over the Hawar Islands. Escalating costs and the subsequent diplomatic row helped place the project on the back burner.\n\n\n"}

Vørsel and Trier play themselves, coming up with a last-minute script for a producer. The story is inter-cut with scenes from the film they write, in which Trier plays a renegade doctor trying to cure a modern-day epidemic. The film marks the first in a series of collaborations between Trier and Udo Kier.\n\nThe film is divided into five days. On the first day the protagonists, screenwriters Lars and Niels lose the only copy of a film script (Kommisæren Og Luderen, \"The Policeman and the Whore\", a reference to \"The Element of Crime\"). They begin to write a new script about an epidemic: the outbreak of a plague-like disease. The protagonist is a doctor, Mesmer, who, against the will of the Faculty of Medicine of an unknown city, goes to the countryside to help people. During the next days, the facts of the script join the real-life events in which a similar disease starts to spread. Lars and Niels go to Germany, where they meet a man who describes the Allied bombing of Cologne during the Second World War.\n\nAfter the trip, Niels goes to a hospital where he undergoes a minor surgical procedure and while there tells Lars to go to see Palle, a pathologist who is performing an autopsy on a man who has recently died of an unknown disease. The last day, Lars and Niels have a dinner with their producer, to whom they reveal the end of the film, that Mesmer and his medical kit have spread the disease. The producer doesn't like the short twelve-page script, which has no violence, few deaths, and no subplots (which are common in Danish cinema). After that a hypnotist and a woman arrive in the house, to \"help\" writing the script, but the woman is overpowered by the visions of the script which are becoming real. She commits suicide, then another woman who shares the house with Lars and Niels dies too, and Niels begins showing the signs of the disease.\n\nThe film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated for Best Film at the Fantasporto International Fantasy Film Festival in 1988.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 33%, based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 66 out of 100, based on 4 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRobert K. Elder of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 3 out of 4, and wrote \"Will never be confused with von Trier's great films. But it is an intriguing introduction to his later cinematic obsessions.\" \"The Village Voice\" called the film \"among [Lars von Trier's] better and most revealing movies\". \"Chicago Reader\" gave the film 3 out of 5, and stated \"Aside from the Pirandellian games and some interplay of different film stocks there isn't much going on here, though von Trier rewards the patient with a strange and horrifying climax.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1923052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923052", "title": "Sunshowers", "text": "Sunshowers\n\n\"Sunshowers\" is a song by British musician M.I.A. from her critically acclaimed debut album \"Arular\". It was written and produced by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Ross Orton, Steve Mackey, August Darnell and Stony Jr. Browder with additional vocals and production by Nesreen Shah and Anthony Whiting. The song was released as the second single of the album on 7 July 2004 following the 2003 release of debut \"Galang\" and is M.I.A.'s first official release with XL Recordings. Released in vinyl record and CD single format, with the song \"Fire Fire\" serving as the song's B-side, \"Sunshowers\" was distributed by Interscope Records in the US .\n\n\"Sunshowers\" is a downtempo jungle-dance song, composed on the songwriter's Roland MC-505. The song's chorus interpolates the song \"Sunshower\" by Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band. The song gained immediate international recognition following use in fashion shows, club rotations and internet filesharing. Designer Matthew Williamson opened and closed his fashion week runway show with the song in September 2004 in New York. \"Sunshowers\" and other songs such as \"Galang\" and \"Fire Fire\" propagated rapidly through international fashion shows and filesharing. The song debuted at number 22 on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 93 on the UK Singles Chart and was widely acclaimed among music critics, who noted its wide ranging lyrical subject matter, delivery and music direction as highlights of the track.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Rajesh Touchriver and filmed in South India. Writing the video, M.I.A. was inspired to work with Touchriver after watching his debut film \"In the Name of Buddha\". The video, frequently cited by M.I.A. as her favorite ever made, faced censorship controversies on TV and Radio, and was banned from MTV after a refusal by the songwriter to censor some of the song's lyrics or run a disclaimer disavowing them. \"Sunshowers\" was ranked 100 on \"Slant\"'s \"Best of the Aughts: Singles,\" its list of the top 100 singles of the decade.\n\n\"Sunshowers\" was released 7 July 2004 as the first single of the album \"Arular\" released by XL Recordings. It followed the release of \"Galang\" on Showbiz Records the previous year. The single was released on CD and 12-inch vinyl format. The B-side to the CD single contains the song \"Fire Fire\", while an instrumental and a cappella version of the track also follow on the track listing of this format. On the 12\" single, tracks 2 and 3 are switched.\n\nUploading \"Sunshowers\", \"Galang\" and others she had recorded onto music sharing website MySpace in June 2004 paralleled the file-sharing and fast propagation of the songs around the Internet by word-of-mouth, increasing the songs' international listenership. This led to wide acclaim for the singer, who is hailed as one of the first artists to build a large fanbase exclusively via these channels and as someone who could be studied to reexamine the internet's impact on how listeners are exposed to new music. Malik Meer of \"The Guardian\" notes how the spread of the songs across the web confirmed M.I.A's status as one of the first popstars of the digital age, while Gary Shteyngart, writing for GQ, commented on how her music went viral across the internet \"before anyone was even using the word \"viral\". On September 10, 2004, the singer attended designer Matthew Williamson's \"Spring 2005\" show during the Olympus Fashion Week in New York, where \"Sunshowers\" was used on the runway.\n\nWriters for \"Slant\", listing the song at number 100 on the \"Best of the Aughts: Singles,\" its list of the Top 100 Singles of the Decade, noted the song's lyrical range and novelty in being used on fashion runway shows, saying \"A runway is not the venue you expect to hear about gun culture, the Iraq War, the PLO, snipers, racial profiling, and sweatshops, but those are just some of the topics that M.I.A. managed to squeeze into the three-minute sophomore single from her debut album \"Arular\".\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters, citing the lyric “I salt and pepper my mango/ Shoot spit at the window” compared the song favourably to the song \"Galang\", noting that \"Sunshowers\" \"continued the fascinating contrast between playful and defiant.\" Begrand described the song as speaking of urban violence and anti-Muslim sentiment in the West. Similarly, Josh Timmermann of \"Stylus\" magazine ranked the song alongside \"Galang\" as \"among the most exciting singles of last year\" and that the track \"managed to sound like honey even while M.I.A. rapped (as much as Mike Skinner or Nellie McKay \"rap\") about a man being gunned down for associating with Muslims.\" He concluded \"M.I.A. may be a critical darling, but she’s not so esoteric in the grand scheme of things. This is music that everyone can relate to, dance to, salt and pepper their mangoes to.\"\n\nDavid Day of \"Dusted\" magazine, in a track-by-track review of the album, described the song as one of the three best songs on \"Arular\" and containing the best lyrics, citing its lyric \"Like PLO we don't surrendo!\" Day praised the use of the sample in the chorus, stating it brought the song \"a real pop flavor that has crossover written in calligraphy. The beat, minimal like Missy and Lumidee, serves to spotlight her wordplay.\" Betty Clarke of \"The Guardian\", noted the lyric \"I [sic] bongo with my lingo/ Beat it like a wing yo [sic]/ Can't stereotype my thing yo\", writing \"a fractured backing of hip-hop beats and dancehall rhythms is peppered with poetic slang.\" Robert Christgau, writing in the \"Village Voice\" noted the references to violence in the song, saying it is \"everywhere, dropped casually like a funk grenade or flaunted instructively as in the oft quoted \"It's a bomb yo/So run yo/Put away your stupid gun yo.\" But not for a moment does the violence seem vindictive, sadistic, or pleasurable. It's a fact of life to be triumphed over, with beats and tunelets stolen or remembered or willed into existence.\" Ruth Jamieson of BBC called the song \"achingly beautiful\" with its \"unsettling, unusual but ooh-so alluring vo-coded harmonies\" singled out for praise.\n\nThe music video for \"Sunshowers\" was directed by Rajesh Touchriver and filmed in the jungles of South India. M.I.A. has frequently cited it as her favourite music video ever made. In one scene, M.I.A. is perched atop an elephant.\nThe song faced censorship controversies on TV and radio, and was banned from MTV after M.I.A. refused to remove the lines: \"You wanna go? You wanna win a war? Like PLO, I don't surrendo\" for airplay.\n\nThe song's lyrics are sampled in the song \"New Thing\", released in 2011 by Rye Rye.\n\nCD single\n\nThe only difference the 12\" single has is that tracks 2 and 3 are switched.\n\n\nSource:\n"}

The first official Eurovision transmission took place on 6 June 1954. It showed the Narcissus Festival in Montreux, Switzerland.\n\nIt has a radio counterpart, Euroradio, within that same European Broadcasting Union.\n\nThe name \"Eurovision\" was originally coined by British journalist George Campey when writing for the \"Evening Standard\", and was adopted by the EBU for its network.\n\nEurovision is managed by the European Broadcasting Union’s Eurovision Operations Department and offers permanent coverage of Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as ad-hoc coverage of the African continent and the Pacific Rim.\n\nNot confined only to Europe, Eurovision currently encompasses 75 television broadcasting organizations located in 56 countries of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Furthermore, there are 61 associated broadcasting organizations in Europe, Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nThe EBU in co-operation with the respective host broadcaster, organises competitions and events in which its Members can participate, if they wish to do so. These include:\nThe Eurovision Song Contest () is an annual international song competition that was first held in Lugano, Switzerland, on 24 May 1956. Seven countries participated – each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. This was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957 all contests have allowed one entry per country. The 1956 contest was won by the host nation, Switzerland. In this competition, only countries that are members of the EBU can participate. The first winner was Switzerland, and the most recent is The Netherlands with a new voting system.

{"id": "1923060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923060", "title": "Buddhism in Vietnam", "text": "Buddhism in Vietnam\n\nBuddhism in Vietnam (\"Đạo Phật\" or \"Phật Giáo\" in Vietnamese), as practised by the ethnic Vietnamese, is mainly of the Mahayana tradition. Buddhism may have first come to Vietnam as early as the 3rd or 2nd century BCE from the Indian subcontinent or from China in the 1st or 2nd century CE. Vietnamese Buddhism has had a syncretic relationship with certain elements of Taoism, Chinese spirituality, and Vietnamese folk religion.\n\nThere are conflicting theories regarding whether Buddhism first reached Vietnam during the 3rd or 2nd century BCE via delegations from India, or during the 1st or 2nd century from China. In either case, by the end of the second century CE, Vietnam had developed into a major regional Mahayana Buddhist center centering on Luy Lâu in modern Bắc Ninh Province, northeast of the present day capital city of Hanoi. Luy Lâu was the capital of the Han region of Jiaozhi and was a popular place visited by many Indian Buddhist missionary monks en route to China. The monks followed the maritime trade route from the Indian sub-continent to China used by Indian traders. A number of Mahayana sutras and the āgamas were translated into Classical Chinese there, including the \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\" and the \"Anapanasati\".\n\nJiaozhi was the birthplace of Buddhist missionary Kang Senghui who was of Sogdian origin.\n\nOver the next eighteen centuries, Vietnam and China shared many common features of cultural, philosophical and religious heritage. This was due to geographical proximity to one another and Vietnam being annexed twice by China. Vietnamese Buddhism is thus related to Chinese Buddhism in general, and to some extent reflects the formation of Chinese Buddhism after the Song dynasty. Theravada Buddhism, on the other hand, would become incorporated through the southern annexation of Khmer people and territories.\n\nDuring the Đinh dynasty (968–980), Buddhism was recognized by the state as an official faith (~971), reflecting the high esteem of Buddhist faith held by the Vietnamese monarchs. The Early Lê dynasty (980–1009) also afforded the same recognition to the Buddhist church. The growth of Buddhism during this time is attributed to the recruitment of erudite monks to the court as the newly independent state needed an ideological basis on which to build a country. Subsequently, this role was ceded to Confucianism.\n\nVietnamese Buddhism reached its zenith during the Lý dynasty (1009–1225) beginning with the founder Lý Thái Tổ, who was raised in a pagoda. All of the kings during the Lý dynasty professed and sanctioned Buddhism as the state religion. This endured with the Trần dynasty (1225–1400) but Buddhism had to share the stage with the emerging growth of Confucianism.\n\nBy the 15th century, Buddhism fell out of favor with the court during the Later Lê dynasty, although still popular with the masses. Officials like Lê Quát attacked it as heretical and wasteful. It was not until the 19th century that Buddhism regained some stature under the Nguyễn dynasty who accorded royal support.\n\nA Buddhist revival movement (Chấn hưng Phật giáo) emerged in the 1920s in an effort to reform and strengthen institutional Buddhism, which had lost grounds to the spread of Christianity and the growth of other faiths under French rule. The movement continued into the 1950s.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam. In a country where surveys of the religious composition estimated the Buddhist majority to be approximately 50 to 70 percent, President Ngô Đình Diệm's policies generated claims of religious bias. As a member of the Catholic Vietnamese minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.\nIn May 1963, in the central city of Huế, where Diệm's elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the archbishop, Buddhists were prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrations yet few days earlier, Catholics were allowed to fly religious flags at a celebration in honour of the newly seated archbishop. This led to widespread protest against the government; troops were sent in and nine civilians were killed in the confrontations. This led to mass rallies against Diệm's government, termed as the Buddhist crisis. The conflicts culminated in Thích Quảng Đức's self-immolation. President Diệm's younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu favored strong-armed tactics and Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces engaged in the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids, killing estimated hundreds. Dismayed by the public outrage, the US government withdrew support for the regime. President Diệm was deposed and killed in the 1963 coup.\n\nPolitical strength of the Buddhists grew in the 1960s as the different schools and orders convene to form the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. Leaders of the Church like Thích Trí Quang had considerable sway in national politics, at times challenging the government.\n\nWith the fall of Saigon in 1975, the whole nation came under Communist rule; many religious practices including Buddhism were discouraged. In the North the government had created the United Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, co-opting the clergy to function under government auspices but in the South, the Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam still held sway and openly challenged the communist government. The Sangha leadership was thus arrested and imprisoned; Sangha properties were seized and the Sangha itself was outlawed. In its place was the newly created Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, designed as the final union of all Buddhist organizations, now under full state control.\n\nThe treatment of Buddhists started to ease since Đổi mới in 1986.\n\nSince Đổi Mới (1986) many reforms have allowed Buddhism to be practiced relatively unhindered by the individuals. However no organized sangha is allowed to function independent of the state. It was not until 2007 that Pure Land Buddhism, the most widespread type of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam, was officially recognized as a religion by the government. Thích Quảng Độ the Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Sangha, once imprisoned, remains under surveillance and restricted in his travels.\n\nToday, Buddhists are found throughout Vietnam, from North to South. Buddhism is the single largest organized religion in Vietnam, with somewhere between 12.2% and 16.4% of the population identifying themselves as Buddhist. Some argued the number to be higher than reported, as many declared themselves as atheists, but still participated in Buddhist activities.\n\nOn one hand, though the Communist Party of Vietnam officially promotes atheism, it has usually leaned in favor of Buddhism, as Buddhism is associated with the long and deep history of Vietnam, and also, there have rarely been disputes between Buddhists and the Government; the Communist Government also sees Buddhism as a symbol of Vietnamese patriotism. Buddhist festivals are officially promoted by the Government and restrictions are few, in contrast to its Christian, Muslim and other religious counterparts.\n\nRecently, the Communist regime in Vietnam allowed major Buddhist figures to enter the country. Thích Nhất Hạnh, a major Buddhist figure revered both in Vietnam and worldwide, is among these. In order to distance itself from the fellow communist neighbor China, the Government of Vietnam allows the publishing of books and stories of 14th Dalai Lama, who has a personal friendship with Thích Nhất Hạnh and were commonly critical of the Chinese regime after the 2008 Tibetan unrest, which was seen as an attempt to antagonize the Chinese Government and China as a whole as Beijing considers the Dalai Lama to be a terrorist.\n\nAfter the fall of South Vietnam to communism in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, the first major Buddhist community appeared in North America. Since this time, the North American Vietnamese Buddhist community has grown to some 160 temples and centers. Proselytizing is not a priority.\n\nThe most famous practitioner of synchronized Vietnamese Thiền in the West is Thích Nhất Hạnh who has authored dozens of books and founded the Plum Village Monastery in France together with his colleague, bhikṣuṇī and Zen Master Chân Không. According to Nguyen and Barber, Thích Nhất Hạnh's fame in the Western world as a proponent of engaged Buddhism and a new Thiền style has \"no affinity with or any foundation in traditional Vietnamese Buddhist practices\" and according to Alexander Soucy (2007) his style of Zen Buddhism is not reflective of actual Vietnamese Buddhism. Thích Nhất Hạnh often recounts about his early Thiền practices in Vietnam in his Dharma talks saying that he continued and developed this practice in the West which has a distinctive Vietnamese Thiền flavor.\n\nThích Nhất Hạnh's Buddhist teachings have started to return to a Vietnam where the Buddhist landscape is now being shaped by the combined Vietnamese and Westernized Buddhism that is focused more on the meditative practices.\n\nFollowers in Vietnam practice differing traditions without any problem or sense of contradiction. Few Vietnamese Buddhists would identify themselves as a particular kind of Buddhism, as a Christian might identify him or herself by a denomination, for example. Although Vietnamese Buddhism does not have a strong centralized structure, the practice is similar throughout the country at almost any temple.\n\nGaining merit is the most common and essential practice in Vietnamese Buddhism with a belief that liberation takes place with the help of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Buddhist monks commonly chant sutras, recite Buddhas’ names (particularly Amitābha), doing repentance and praying for rebirth in the Pure Land.\n\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" and the \"Amitabha Sutra\" are the most commonly used sutras. Most sutras and texts are in Classical Chinese and are merely recited with Sino-Xenic pronunciations, making them incomprehensible to most practitioners.\n\nThree services are practiced regularly at dawn, noon, and dusk. They include sutra reading with niệm Phật and dhāraṇī recitation and kinh hành (walking meditation). Laypeople at times join the services at the temple and some devout Buddhist practice the services at home. Special services such as Sam Nguyen/Sam Hoi (confession/repentance) takes place on the full moon and new moon each month. Niệm Phật practice is one way of repenting and purifying bad karma.\n\nBuddhist temples also serve a significant role in death rituals and funerals among overseas Vietnamese.\n\nThe overall doctrinal position of Vietnamese Buddhism is the inclusive system of Tiantai, with the higher metaphysics informed by the Huayan school (); however, the orientation of Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic without making such distinctions. Therefore, modern practice of Vietnamese Buddhism can be very eclectic, including elements from \"Thiền\" (Chan Buddhism), \"Thiên Thai\" (Tiantai), \"Tịnh độ\" Pure Land Buddhism, and popular practices from Vajrayana. According to Charles Prebish, many English language sources contain misconceptions regarding the variety of doctrines and practices in traditional Vietnamese Buddhism:\n\nThe methods of Pure Land Buddhism are perhaps the most widespread within Vietnam. It is common for practitioners to recite sutras, chants and dhāraṇīs looking to gain protection through bodhisattvas or dharmapalas. It is a devotional practice where those practicing put their faith in Amitābha (). Followers believe they will gain rebirth in his pure land by chanting Amitabha's name. A pure land is a Buddha-realm where one can more easily attain enlightenment since suffering does not exist there.\n\nMany religious organizations have not been recognized by the government; however, in 2007, with 1.5 million followers, the Vietnamese Pure Land Buddhism Association (Tịnh Độ Cư Sĩ Phật Hội Việt Nam) received official recognition as an independent and legal religious organization.\n\nThiền is the Sino-Xenic pronunciation of \"Chan\" (Japanese \"Zen\") and is derived ultimately from Sanskrit \"dhyāna\". The traditional account is that in 580, an Indian monk named Vinitaruci () traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chan Buddhism. This would be the first appearance of Thiền. The sect that Vinitaruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thiền. After a period of obscurity, the Vinitaruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly under the patriarch Vạn-Hạnh (died 1018). Other early Vietnamese Zen schools included the Vô Ngôn Thông, which was associated with the teaching of Mazu Daoyi, and the Thảo Đường, which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\nA new Thiền school was founded by King Trần Nhân Tông (1258–1308); called the Trúc Lâm \"Bamboo Grove\" school, it evinced a deep influence from Confucian and Taoist philosophy. Nevertheless, Trúc Lâm's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court. In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguyên Thiều introduced the Ling school (Lâm Tế). A more native offshoot of Lâm Tế, the Liễu Quán school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Zen.\nSome scholars argue that the importance and prevalence of Thiền in Vietnam has been greatly overstated and that it has played more of an elite rhetorical role than a role of practice. The \"Thiền uyển tập anh\" (, \"Collection of Outstanding Figures of the Zen Garden\") has been the dominant text used to legitimize Thiền lineages and history within Vietnam. However, Cuong Tu Nguyen's \"Zen in Medieval Vietnam: A Study and Translation of the Thien Tap Anh\" (1997) gives a critical review of how the text has been used to create a history of Zen Buddhism that is \"fraught with discontinuity\". Modern Buddhist practices are not reflective of a Thiền past; in Vietnam, common practices are more focused on ritual and devotion than the Thiền focus on meditation. Nonetheless, Vietnam is seeing a steady growth in Zen today. Two figures who have been responsible for this increased interest in Thiền are Thích Nhất Hạnh, and Thích Thanh Từ, who lives in Da Lat.\n\nThe central and southern part of present-day Vietnam were originally inhabited by the Chams and the Khmer people, respectively, who followed both a syncretic Śaiva-Mahayana (see History of Buddhism in Cambodia) and Theravada Buddhism. Đại Việt annexed the land occupied by the Cham during conquests in the 15th century and by the 18th century had also annexed the southern portion of the Khmer Empire, resulting in the current borders of Vietnam. From that time onward, the dominant Đại Việt (Vietnamese) followed the Mahayana tradition while the Khmer continued to practice Theravada.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there were a number of movements in Vietnam for the revival and modernization of Buddhist activities. Together with the re-organization of Mahayana establishments, there developed a growing interest in Theravadin meditation as well as the Pāli Canon. These were then available in French. Among the pioneers who brought Theravada Buddhism to the ethnic Đại Việt was a young veterinary doctor named Lê Văn Giảng. He was born in the South, received higher education in Hanoi, and after graduation, was sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to work for the French government.\n\nDuring that time he became especially interested in Theravada Buddhist practice. Subsequently, he decided to ordain and took the Dhamma name of Hộ-Tông (Vansarakkhita). In 1940, upon an invitation from a group of lay Buddhists led by Nguyễn Văn Hiểu, he went back to Vietnam in order to help establish the first Theravada temple for Vietnamese Buddhists at Gò Dưa, Thủ Đức (now a district of Hồ Chí Minh City). The temple was named Bửu Quang (Ratana Ramsyarama). The temple was destroyed by French troops in 1947, and was later rebuilt in 1951. At Bửu Quang temple, together with a group of Vietnamese bhikkhus who had received training in Cambodia such as Thiện Luật, Bửu Chơn, Kim Quang and Giới Nghiêm, Hộ Tông began teaching Buddhism in their native Vietnamese. He also translated many Buddhist materials from the Pali Canon, and Theravada became part of Vietnamese Buddhist activity in the country.\n\nIn 1949–1950, Hộ Tông together with Nguyễn Văn Hiểu and supporters built a new temple in Saigon (now Hồ Chí Minh City), named Kỳ Viên Tự (\"Jetavana Vihara\"). This temple became the centre of Theravada activities in Vietnam, which continued to attract increasing interest among the Vietnamese Buddhists. In 1957, the Vietnamese Theravada Buddhist Sangha Congregation (Giáo Hội Tăng Già Nguyên Thủy Việt Nam) was formally established and recognised by the government, and the Theravada Sangha elected Venerable Hộ Tông as its first President, or Sangharaja.\n\nFrom Saigon, the Theravada movement spread to other provinces, and soon, a number of Theravada temples for ethnic Viet Buddhists were established in many areas in the South and Central parts of Vietnam. There are 529 Theravada temples throughout the country, of which 19 were located in Hồ Chí Minh City and its vicinity. Besides Bửu Quang and Kỳ Viên temples, other well known temples are Bửu Long, Giác Quang, Tam Bảo (Đà Nẵng), Thiền Lâm and Huyền Không (Huế), and the large Thích Ca Phật Đài in Vũng Tàu.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was based on the Fiat 124 saloon.\n\nIts four cylinder aluminum and iron, twin overhead cam 'Lampredi engine' was designed by ex-Ferrari engineer Aurelio Lampredi. Originally, the AC, or first generation, featured a 1,438 cc engine, which grew to 1,608 cc in the second, or BC, generation. The third generation, or CC, was first officially offered with the 1,592 cc and later the 1,756 cc engine (some early CC models left the factory with left over 1,608 cc engines).\n\nEquipment included a 5-speed gearbox (although very early AC models featured a 4-speed), four wheel power disc brakes, double wishbone front suspension, one carburetor per cylinder (Two dual-choke Weber or Solex carburetors on the BC series 1608 engine - except for the USA version which received mild carburation due to emissions constraints), electric fuel pump (on the CC series), and suspension by coil springs.\n\nThe Fiat 124 Sport Coupé was also built under license in Spain with 1600 (FC-00) and 1800 (FC-02) engines as the SEAT 124 Sport.\n\nThe 124 Sport Coupé was designed as a three-box, 2-door notchback coupé by Mario Boano, known for styling the bodywork on the Ferrari 250 GT \"Boano\". As many parts as possible were used from the 1966 FIAT 124 \"Berlina\" saloon. Boano was hired by FIAT and made responsible for the in-house \"Centro Stile Fiat\", while the iconic softtop Fiat 124 Sport Spider, which also shared the same basic platform as the 124 Sedan but rode on a 14 cm shorter wheelbase, was outsourced to famed Italian \"carrozzeria\" Pininfarina.\n\nApproximately 113,000 AC Coupés, 98,000 BC Coupés 1438 cc/1608 cc, and roughly 75,000 CC Coupés were manufactured. There were ongoing changes with all models making them almost individual by year (e.g. lack of rear sway bar on 1969 ACs, etc.)\n\nThe Fiat 124 Spider Abarth came with dual Weber 44 IDF carburetors unlike the regular 124 coupés and spiders which were equipped with dual Weber 40 IDF carbs. Fiat twincam engines tend to be oversquare, with a larger diameter bore than length of stroke. The 1608 cc, however, is a perfectly square engine, 80 mm by 80 mm, allowing it, when combined with dual camshafts and proper carburetors, to rev to high rpms.\n\n\nThe AC model began in 1967 and came with a 1438 cc twin cam, 4-speed gearbox (the option of a 5-speed item appearing in mid-'67), front and rear anti-roll bars and a torque tube rear axle. It featured a speedometer, three supplementary gauges, a faux wood steering wheel, a woodgrain dash and console top, as well as tail lights shared with the Lamborghini Espada and Iso Rivolta.\n\n124 Sport Coupés were modern in chassis and engine design. Braking was via four 230 mm disc brakes with a front/rear weight-sensitive proportioning valve. It also had a sealed cooling system, viscous fan clutch and a toothed timing belt for the twin-cam engine, the first mass-produced engine to feature this instead of the usual chain-drive.\n\nThe torque-tube rear axle of the A series was replaced by a four-link rear axle with a Panhard rod in mid-'68, and remained the same throughout B and C models.\n\n\nThe BC featured revised styling with twin headlights and revised taillights shared with the Lamborghini Jarama.\n\nThe BC was available with both the 1438 cc and later (although sooner in Europe) the 1608 cc engine. Other details remained similar to the AC except the interior dash now had a speedometer, 9000 rpm tachometer in 1608 cc models and a clock. The steering wheel now had black painted spokes and the seats had for the first time cloth inserts in the centre. There was no woodgrain inside like before (all the panels were finished in black vinyl and the gauge rims were matt black) and \"eyeball\" vents were fitted in the centre console where the AC had a decorative panel simply filling in the space for an optional radio.\n\nOptions included green tinted windows, Cromodora alloy wheels with chrome centre hub cap (as per AC optional), radio, seat headrests, rear windshield electric defrosting, electronic ignition. At the end of the BC run air conditioning was available as an option as well. The fuel tanks were always around .\n\n\nThe CC Coupe arrived in 1973 with new front styling and a revised squarer rear tail with a new deeper trunklid. Taillights also changed to a now vertical arrangement and side rear windows were revised.\n\nThe CC started with a small batch fitted with the 1608 cc engine, soon changing to a revised 1592 cc engine (slightly shorter stroke at 79,2 mm to create a \"sub-1600\" engine to fit the lower tax bracket in Italy) and an enlarged 84 mm bore creating an engine of 1756 cc. The 1592 cc and 1756 cc (sourced from the new Fiat 132, introduced in 1972) both made use of a single carburetor again (the Weber 34 DMS). In spite of this change the 1756 cc was the most powerful engine produced with and a top speed of .\n\nThe CC's revised interior featured a new dashboard incorporating a lower panel on the passenger side, an alloy fascia in front of the driver and seats covered completely in cloth. There was a new vinyl-covered steering wheel rim with anodised silver spokes. The optional but not uncommon Cromodora wheels now had a revised design with no chrome centre hubcap, instead having exposed wheelnuts. These were of an 8 slot design, the earlier wheels used coming in 6 slot configuration (an 8-slot design was also current but not original to the 124 range).\n\nThe car was also built with 1600 (FC-00) and 1800 (FC-02) engines under license in Spain as the SEAT 124 Sport. The first series produced was equivalent to the BC series of Fiat's version, and used 1608 cc engines coded FA provided by Fiat itself. The second series was a direct copy of the CC model, and only used 1756 cc engines coded as FC, and less common 132AC. SEAT later developed facilities for producing its own engines of this family, but it appears that the Sport versions were actually built in Italy.\n\n"}

The genus members are commonly called bog clubmosses, describing their wetland habitat. The genus has a cosmopolitan, with centers of diversity in the tropical New World and New Guinea. In the past, the genus was often incorporated within the related genus \"Lycopodium\", but was segregated in 1964. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), \"Lycopodiella\" is placed in the subfamily Lycopodielloideae, along with three other genera. In this circumscription, the genus has about 15 species. Other sources use a wider circumscription, in which the genus is equivalent to the subfamily of PPG I, in which case about 40 species and hybrids are accepted.\n\n\"Lycopodiella\" are non-flowering plants. They have leafy rhizomes that grow along the ground and vertical, leafy shoots, also known as peduncles. Fertile peduncles have strobili at the top of the shoot. Individuals can have short, creeping rhizomes with simple strobili, branching rhizomes with many strobili, or anywhere in between. The North American specimens are typically shorter, have thinner shoots, and have fewer vertical shoots in the North than specimen in the South.\n\n\"Lycopodiella\" life cycles include an independent sporophyte stage and a long-lived gametophyte stage. Individuals reproduce by single-celled spores that disperse and germinate into small plants when in suitable conditions. This part of the plant is called the gametophyte; it produces the eggs and sperm. After fertilization, the embryos grow into sporophytes, which are larger spore-bearing plants. The sporophyte is the vegetative part of the plant seen in nature. Juvenile individuals typically re-sprout in the spring or after a fire. Individuals have a base chromosome number of 78.\n\nIn the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), \"Lycopodiella\" is placed in the subfamily Lycopodielloideae, along with three other genera (\"Lateristachys\", \"Palhinhaea\" and \"Pseudolycopodiella\"). Other sources do not recognize these genera, submerging them into \"Lycopodiella\".\n\n, the \"Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World\" recognized the following species:\n\nSome hybrids have also been described:\n\nUsing the broader circumscription of the genus, \"Plants of the World Online\" recognized the following additional \"Lycopodiella\" species . Using the narrow circumscription of the genus \"Lycopodiella\", the \"Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World\" divided them among three other genera:\n\n\"Lycopodiella\" is found worldwide, but typically in temperate and tropical areas, a majority of which are found in North and South America. Individuals are typically found in terrestrial lowlands or montane forests on poor soils. Much of the soils are sandy and saturated and have little to no organic layer.\n\nThe known \"Lycopodiella\" in North America consists of six species and four hybrids. All but one species of \"Lycopodiella\", \"Lycopodiella inundata\", are limited to the East coast, Gulf of Mexico, and/or Great Lakes region. \"L. inundata\" is found from New England to Alaska and down into California.\n\n"}

The game was released in Europe and North America in late 2005, and in Japan and Australia in 2006. The game's sequel, \"Mario Strikers Charged\", was also developed by Next Level Games and is available for the Wii. The game's developers had worked on NHL Hitz Pro before development of \"Strikers\", which served as an influence for the fast-paced and physical nature of the game.\n\n\"Strikers\" is a sports game incorporating characters and themes from the \"Mario\" franchise. The game features the basic aspects and objectives of a football game, although no referees are present and characters can legitimately shove others out of possession of the ball. As in other games such as \"Mario Power Tennis\", the player can use \"Mario\"-themed items such as bananas and red shells to hinder the opposition and gain the advantage. Each team's captain can use \"Super Strikes\" that, if timed accurately, will result in two points scored for the striker's team. Each team comprises a goal keeper, a main \"Mario\" character (captain), and three of the same secondary \"Mario\" characters known as \"sidekicks\".\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In general, reviewers lauded \"Strikers\"' accessibility and multiplayer gameplay, but criticised the lack of gameplay modes and single-player offerings.\n\n\"Super Mario Strikers\" is a five-a-side football console video game comprising characters and themes from the \"Mario\" series. Each team consists of a captain character from the \"Mario\" series and three secondary \"Mario\" characters known as \"sidekicks\". Kritter is the goalkeeper for all sides except the \"Super Team\", which consists of four captain robots and a Robo-Kritter. Both sidekicks and captains have varying gameplay attributes with \"balanced\" and \"defensive\" play types available. \"Strikers\" follows the basic gameplay featured in most football video games, including the ability to dash, tackle players, and lob the ball. Despite this, characters not in possession can legitimately hit opponents with or without the ball (\"Big Hit\"), resulting in a more arcade-like style of gameplay. The game also features \"Perfect\" passes and shots, which trigger in sequence if both a pass and shot are applied close to the opponent's goal. The most powerful shot possible is the \"Super Strike\", which only the captain can make and will account for two points if successful. Once charged, the player must time button presses accurately on a visible gauge to trigger a successful shot at a goal, resulting in a character-specific animation.\n\nAs in other \"Mario\" sports titles such as \"Mario Power Tennis\", the player can use items—bananas, red shells, etc.—to impede the opponent. Some \"power ups\" can aid the user by granting temporary imperviousness while others immobilize and hinder the opponent, Mario always gets the best power-ups. The central antagonist of the \"Mario\" universe, Bowser, will also appear occasionally as a non-player character to obstruct the players from each side. \"Strikers\" includes six stadia, each having barriers to prevent the ball from going out of play. These stadia only vary aesthetically and do not affect gameplay, featuring different surfaces such as grass and wood. The player can adjust the match settings to limit or expand the match time and select whether features such as the Super Strike will be included. As the player advances through the game, further adjustments can be made called \"cheats\", that can render goalkeepers weaker and grant an infinite number of items.\n\n\"Strikers\" includes multiple gameplay modes such as the \"Grudge Match\", which is the standard single and multiplayer match mode of the game. Training sessions come in the form of \"Strikers 101\", where the player can practice individual aspects such as shooting and dashing. \"Cup Battles\" allows up to four players to compete in tournaments against artificial intelligence opponents to advance through more difficult cups for rewards, with \"Super\" denoting the higher-ranked tournaments.\n\n\"Strikers\" was developed by Next Level Games, who revealed the game at the E3 conference of 2005 in the form of a playable demonstration. In an interview, game director Mike Inglehart and marketing director Grace Kim revealed that \"Strikers\" was originally intended to be a more realistic \"Mario\" sports game, but the development team opted for an \"over-the-top\" style after numerous consultations with Nintendo. Next Level Games cited a connection between \"Strikers\" and \"NHL Hitz Pro\" in terms of gameplay mechanics, claiming that the latter influenced the \"responsive gameplay\" in \"Strikers\", as well as the use of goalkeepers and on-field collisions. The developers revealed that the character system would be \"balanced and fun\", although Nintendo had \"the ultimate say\" in regards to character design, wanting strong and aggressive styles that did not deviate from past characterisations too much. For this reason, voice recording for \"Strikers\" required more lines and sounds than in other \"Mario\" sports titles.\n\nAssisted by producer Ken Yeeloy, Inglehart stated in an interview a willingness to link any new feature of \"Strikers\" with the sport of football. With this, they decided to accentuate \"the exciting parts\" of the game, with Inglehart using the electric fences in the stadia as an example in reference to the physicality of the sport. They also explained reasons for not using a penalty or card system, rating the power-up system as compensation for this considering power-ups are awarded to the team of a player that has been pushed or shoved.\n\n\"Super Mario Strikers\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with reviewers lauding the game's characterisation and visual style, being reminiscent to that of Kazuto Nakazawa. GameSpot's Brian Ekberg praised the game's accessibility, stating that \"Strikers' pick-up-and-play design will have you playing like a cartoon Pele in no time\". Similarly, critics welcomed the developers' choice to forgo traditional football rules in the favour of a more arcade-like style of gameplay. Despite this, IGN complained of a \"disappointingly slim\" variety of modes, as well as the perceived small roster of characters and inflexibility when choosing teams. On a similar note, Eurogamer criticised the vague presentation of characters attributes, making it difficult to determine what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. Despite enjoying the variety and appearance of \"Strikers\" stadia, GameSpot noted only cosmetic differences among them, and criticised a lack of physical features to make them more interesting.\n\n\"Strikers\" multiplayer gameplay in particular was welcomed by reviewers, who praised the developers for providing aggressive and fast-paced action. Conversely, the game's single player offerings gained a less enthusiastic response, with critics noting \"boring\" and repetitive gameplay. GameSpot thought some features were \"overpowered\" in parts, including the big-hit tackles and the ability to dash constantly given the absence of a stamina meter. Despite this, Eurogamer remarked that it was deeper than first anticipated, while IGN lauded the game's \"tight controls\" and use of Super Strikes. The ability to push enemies into the electric barrier and the use of items was also welcomed as a means to make the game entertaining while playing defensively.\n\nThe game's visuals received a mixed response, with critics reporting occasional problems with \"Striker\"s framerate. While praising the character models and goal animations, GameSpot bemoaned the absence of a \"Mario feel\" when appraising the menu and settings. IGN noted \"blurry textures, uninspired stadium designs, and almost incomprehensibly a sometimes sluggish framerate\", despite enjoying the characters art style. The audio received a mediocre response, with critics praising the use of character and audience chants while criticising a lack of variety and repetitiveness. GameSpot thought the menu music had \"some nice flair to it\", despite noting sounds such as Luigi's goal celebration that, while charming when first heard, became tedious. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the game a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40; \"Famitsu Cube + Advance\", on the other hand, gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven, for a total of 32 out of 40.\n\nNot all non-video game publications gave the same praise for the game. Common Sense Media gave it all five stars and called it \"a perfect game for a bunch of teenagers to play because it's wacky, fast-paced, and just plain fun.\" However, \"Maxim\" gave it a score of seven out of ten and stated that \"With matches of five-on-five taking place on small fields with really basic controls, Strikers is classic arcade-style soccer, but the game gets an extra kick from power-ups, random Bowser attacks, and a Telemundo-style announcer.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it a similar score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \"immediately likable\".\n\nIn GameSpot's E3 2005 coverage, this game was given the award \"Best Sports Game,\" and was nominated a finalist for \"Best Game of Show.\" It received GameSpy's \"Game of the Year 2005\" awards for \"Best GameCube Sports\", \"Best GameCube Multiplayer\", and was ranked second for all GameCube games in 2005.

It serves the Ashmont branch of the Red Line. It is located in Fields Corner. It opened on November 5, 1927, serving as the southern terminus of the line for about a year until Shawmut and Ashmont opened in 1928.\n\nIn addition to the two rapid transit platforms, one on each side of the line, there were streetcar tracks on each side, with the departing tracks at the north (railroad west) side split into two, and a bus loop under the south (east) track. Free transfers were available between all modes. For buses, a paper transfer was required. The lower-level busway was later closed, and all buses (and trackless trolleys, later discontinued) were routed to the upper level.\n\nThe pedestrian tunnel from Charles Street was controversially closed in January 1970 due to crime and vandalism. In the mid-1980s, the platforms were extended for six-car trains, which were introduced in 1988.\n\nThe MBTA issued a $4.3 million design contract for renovations of Ashmont, Shawmut, and Fields Corner stations on May 3, 2001. Shawmut and Fields Corner reached 100% design by January 10, 2003; Ashmont was delayed due to design changes. The MBTA broke ground for the Red Line Rehabilitation Project - a $67 million reconstruction of Shawmut, Fields Corner, and Savin Hill stations - in October 2003. Construction began in March 2004. The renovations changed the layout of the station, with a new fare lobby under the tracks. The new entrance lobby opened on December 22, 2006, making it the final fare-controlled station on the MBTA to be converted to use the CharlieCard-based automated fare collection system.

The Alexandrina Council was formed on 1 July 1997 by the amalgamation of the District Council of Port Elliot and Goolwa, the District Council of Strathalbyn and a portion of the District Council of Willunga. The council is divided into five wards: Nangkita Kuitpo, Angas Bremer, Port Elliot Middleton, Strathalbyn and Goolwa Hindmarsh Island.\n\nThe district relies on a diverse range of industries including agriculture, fishing, forestry, viticulture and tourism to supply its economy. Many of the towns encompassed in the council are popular tourist towns not far from Adelaide.\n\nThe economy of the Alexandrina Council is very diverse, which may be attributed to the great diversity of landscapes within its boundaries, allowing for diverse rural, fishing and tourism industries to occur.\nThe largest part of the economy comes from agriculture, with a wide variety of farming practices including dairy, beef and sheep farming, with areas around Goolwa and Mount Compass prominent in the dairy industry. A number of crops including cereals, as well as lucerne are planted in the district. Langhorne Creek and Currency Creek are well known for their viticulture, producing high quality Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Chardonnay. In the Kuitpo region, forestry is prominent, with large tracts of pine present.\n\nThe district borders two bodies of water, Encounter Bay and Lake Alexandrina, which are commercially exploited for a variety of fish and crustaceans. The coast produce shark, mulloway and Australian salmon, as well as huge numbers of Goolwa cockles which are exported all over South Australia. Commercial fishing above the locks has become highly regulated to conserve native fish species but golden perch and Murray cod are still caught, and a number of operators have found markets for the invasive European carp.\n\nThe area also has a significant tourism industry, particularly based around the Murray River at Goolwa and the beaches of Port Elliot and Middleton. The SteamRanger \"Cockle Train\" operates from Goolwa and stops at Port Elliot on the way to Victor Harbor.\n\nIn the (held on 8 August 2006), there were 20,715 people who were usually resident in Alexandrina Council's bounds: 49.2% were males and 50.8% were females. Of the total population, 1.1% were Indigenous persons.\n\nIt was found that 18.2% of the population usually resident in Alexandrina Council were aged between 0–14 years, and 36.2% were persons aged 55 years and over. The median age of persons was 45 years, compared with 37 years for persons in Australia.\n\nIn the , 76.5% of people stated they were born in Australia, with lower numbers immigrating from a number of countries, with the most prominent being: England 9.4%, Netherlands 0.8%, Germany 0.8%, Scotland 0.8% and New Zealand 0.8%.\n\nThe most common responses for religious affiliation for persons usually resident were: No Religion 28.4%, Anglican 15.6%, Uniting Church 14.1%, Catholic 10.4% and Lutheran 4.7%.\n\nThe main towns and localities within the council are:\n\n\nSmaller towns and localities covered by the council are:\n\nAngas Plains, Belvidere, Blackfellows Creek, Bletchley, Bull Creek, Dingabledinga, Finniss, Gemmells, Hartley, Highland Valley, Hope Forest, Kuitpo, Kuitpo Colony, Kyeema, Lake Plains, McHarg Creek, Montarra, Mosquito Hill, Mount Jagged, Mount Magnificent, Mount Observation, Mundoo Island, Nangkita, Nurragi, Pages Flat, Paris Creek, Point Sturt, Prospect Hill, Red Creek, Salem, Sandergrove, The Range, Tolderol (part), Tooperang, Willunga Hill, Willyaroo, Woodchester, Yundi.\n\nAlexandrina Council has a directly elected mayor.\n\nStatistics from Annual Reports\n\n\n \n"}

First used by the Sicilian Provenzano crime family in New Orleans and the Morello crime family in New York City, the barrel murders eventually alerted authorities to the existence of the Mafia, leading to the later investigation by New Orleans police chief David C. Hennessy, whose own eventual assassination was attributed to Sicilian mafiosi in 1890, resulting in one of the largest mass lynchings in U.S. history. New York detective Joseph Petrosino's early investigations into the New York barrel murders would lead to a crackdown against the Black Hand and the Morellos until his assassination in 1909. The Morellos, suspected of over 100 murders, continued to use the barrel murder for over thirty years until eventually ceasing after the (now well-publicized) murders resulted in unwanted attention from local authorities. Other non-Italian criminals used the same method to draw police suspicion away from themselves onto the Morellos and other Italian mafiosi.\n\nThe method was later used in Johnny Roselli's death when he was found in a 55-gallon oil drum off the coast of Florida in 1976. It is generally believed Roselli was murdered in revenge for his skimming profits from Las Vegas casinos, but given Roselli's involvement with CIA plots against Fidel Castro in Cuba, others have suggested that Roselli's death was not at the hands of fellow mobsters but that the killers used the barrel method to cast suspicion towards the Mafia.\n\n"}

The highway runs from Agnew near Lake Michigan to the west side of Grand Rapids in the western Lower Peninsula. Lake Michigan Drive continues in each direction from M-45's termini, extending west of US Highway 31 (US 31) and east of Interstate 196 (I-196). In between, the road runs through rural and suburban areas of Ottawa and Kent counties, including the main campus of Grand Valley State University in Allendale. Lake Michigan Drive was originally part of M-50 until the mid-1960s. Previously in the 1920s and 1930s, the M-45 number was designated along a highway in the Upper Peninsula (UP).\n\nLake Michigan Drive starts near Lake Michigan at an intersection with Lakeshore Drive near the Grand Rapids water filtration plant. The road runs east to an intersection with US 31 in Agnew, where the M-45 designation begins. The area is marked by a mix of woodland and agricultural properties. The road runs through rural Ottawa County to Allendale. Through town, Lake Michigan Drive widens to a four-lane divided boulevard with a median. East of the main part of town, M-45 passes the main campus of Grand Valley State University before crossing the Grand River. At 24th Avenue, the highway loses its median and gains a central turn lane. The landscape becomes more suburban as the highway crosses into Kent County near the M-11 intersection in Walker. From here east to the terminus in Grand Rapids, the road is lined with residential subdivisions and commercial properties. At Bridge Street, Lake Michigan Drive turns to the southeast and approaches John Ball Zoological Garden. M-45 ends at the interchange with I-196. Lake Michigan Drive continues east to its end where it becomes Pearl Street near the Grand River downtown.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-45 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system. As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of the traffic using its roadways which is expressed using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, 4,910 vehicles used the section of M-45 near the western terminus daily. Near the interchange with I-196, 32,376 vehicles were observed along Lake Michigan Drive each day. No segment of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nM-45 was originally designated in the UP on what is now M-95 by July 1, 1919. The highway ran between M-12 in Sagola and M-15 in Humboldt Township. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US 2 replaced most of M-12 through the UP. M-45 was extended south of Sagola to the north side of Iron Mountain. Along with this change, M-69 replaced another previous section of M-12 and all of M-90. M-69 ran concurrently with M-45 between Sagola and Randville to connect these two highway segments. By 1933, M-45 was extended concurrently along US 2/US 141 into Iron Mountain and then as an independent routing through Kingsford to the Wisconsin state line. Before the next year, the M-95 replaced M-45 in the UP.\n\nThe current designation of M-45 dates back to 1964. M-50 was truncated to end near Lowell at I-96. The remainder of M-50 on Cascade Road, Fulton Street and Lake Michigan Drive was redesignated as M-45. The eastern section from Business US  131 (Division Avenue) to I-96 was turned over to local control in 1972, shortening the route. The east end would be shortened again by 1995, removing the M-45 designation east of I-196. Jurisdiction was only transferred to the City of Grand Rapids on the portion from Division Avenue west to the Grand River, leaving part of West Fulton Street under state maintenance as an unsigned trunkline. M-45 was upgraded to a four-lane divided highway in 2001–02 between Walker and the Grand Valley State campus in Allendale. The new alignment bypassed a section of road between 24th and 40th avenues. That section was renamed River Hill Drive, but retained as an unsigned state trunkline (Old M-45).\n\n"}

Different sources suggest a birth year of 1937, 1945, or 1946. His widow has said that his birthday was August 20, but would not confirm the year because he believed age was irrelevant. However, 1940 census records indicate he was born in Utah in 1937.\n\nSaxon began his career performing doo-wop pop tunes in the early 1960s under the name Little Richie Marsh. After changing his name to Sky Saxon, he formed the Electra-Fires in 1962 and then Sky Saxon & the Soul Rockers. Several of these early songs were collected on a 1983 album on AIP called \"New Fruit from Old Seeds / The Rare Sky Saxon, Volume One\".\n\nIn 1965, Saxon founded the psychedelic flower power band The Seeds with Jan Savage (guitar), Rick Andridge (drums), and Darryl Hooper (keyboards). Hit songs for Saxon and the Seeds included \"Can't Seem to Make You Mine\", \"Mr. Farmer\", and \"Pushin' Too Hard,\" which became a top 40 song and enduring rock anthem in 1967. Saxon's singing performance was dismissed by critic Lester Bangs as an American imitation of Mick Jagger, while Michael Hicks considered it a more complicated synthesis of Jagger, Eddie Cochran, and Buddy Holly. The music on the Seeds 1966 albums \"The Seeds\" (GNP Crescendo 2023) and \"A Web of Sound\" (GNP Crescendo 2033) have been described as \"weird psychotic blues highlighting Sky's demented, vocal sermonizing.\"\n\nA spinoff project, The Sky Saxon Blues Band, recorded one album, \"A Full Spoon of Seedy Blues\", (GNP Crescendo 2040) with members of Muddy Waters' band. At the same time, Saxon continued The Seeds, recording \"Future\" (GNP Crescendo 2038) and \"\" (GNP Crescendo 2043). Later, in 1977 producer Neil Norman compiled and released \"Fallin' Off the Edge\" (GNP Crescendo 2107). an album containing rare \"B\" sides and unissued material.\n\n\"Pushin' Too Hard\" was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nIn the 1970s, Saxon continued to work on the music scene, releasing a number of 45s and a few independently released LPs, often using the name Sky Sunlight Saxon, the New Seeds, or variations thereupon. His 1977 EP is particularly noteworthy.\n\nIn 1973, he became a member of the Source Family religious group, a Hollywood Hills commune led by YaHoWha (a restaurateur, whose real name was Jim Baker) who gave Saxon the names Sunlight and Arlick. Consequently, he became a vegetarian. In 1998, Saxon orchestrated the release of a 13-CD set of the psychedelic tribal music recorded by the commune's band Ya Ho Wa 13 during the 1970s.\n\nIn subsequent years, Saxon released a number of albums under various band names including The Starry Seeds Band, Sky Saxon & Firewall, The Hour, Wolf Pack, Fast Planet, Back to the Garden, King Arthur's Court, and Shapes Have Fangs. In late 1999 Saxon teamed up with his friend Djin Aquarian from the Ya Ho Wa 13 band on guitar, with drummer David Walas and bass player David Phillips. This led to an album released after the band stopped playing together called \"This Band Was From Mt. Shasta\". Additionally, Saxon had several times reformed The Seeds with different musician line-ups.\n\nIn 2008, Saxon and the Seeds collaborated on some new songs and recordings with Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins. Saxon later appeared in the music video of the Smashing Pumpkins' song \"Superchrist\". Sky Saxon's last performance and recording was done in Austin, Texas.\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Saxon died unexpectedly in an Austin, Texas hospital of an infection that had spread throughout his organs due to a simple infection contracted at some point that was never treated. At age 71, Saxon died of heart and renal failure due to the infection. Saxon's death was overshadowed by the death of Farrah Fawcett, which in turn was overshadowed by the death of Michael Jackson, all on the same date.\n\nAt the time of his death, he had been scheduled to commence a tour of the United States and Canada as part of the \"California '66\" tour, featuring reformed versions of The Seeds, The Electric Prunes, and Love.\n\nOn July 24, 2009, members of The Smashing Pumpkins, Love, and The Electric Prunes performed a tribute concert at the Echoplex in Los Angeles in Saxon's memory.\n\n"}

Based in Jackson, Michigan, the chain operated primarily in Michigan and Florida, but also had stores in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Kansas. Jacobson's focused on apparel, fine jewelry and home furnishings. The chain entered bankruptcy in early 2002 after 164 years of service. One store in Winter Park, Florida was re-established as Jacobson's in 2004, but closed in 2011.\n\nThe first Jacobson's store was opened by Abram Jacobson in Reed City, Michigan in 1838. It eventually expanded to Ann Arbor, Battle Creek and Jackson, Michigan as well, moving its headquarters to Jackson in 1937. Two years later, brothers Zola and Nathan Rosenfeld purchased the company and began expanding it throughout the state. Zola held the title of company president at the time of his death in 1961, while Nathan remained chairman until his 1982 death.\n\nIn 1945, Nathan Rosenfeld hired J. Russell Fowler, a former manager for the Jordan Marsh chain, to manage Jacobson's as well. Under Fowler's management, Jacobson's saw a significant increase in sales and expanded into Florida. Despite declining sales in the 1980s, the chain attempted two prototypes: a more upscale store at Laurel Park Place in Livonia and a discount store in Troy.\n\nJacobson's faced further retail decline in the early 1990s. In 1991, the store began operating on Sundays. Previously, Jacobson's stores were closed on Sundays, as it was believed that doing so would help to attract a better caliber employee. Also that year, the chain opened a store in Naples, Florida, and moved its flagship from downtown Ann Arbor to a former Lord & Taylor location at Briarwood Mall. A location in Birmingham, Michigan was also renovated to target upscale shoppers in their mid-twenties.\n\nThe chain made further changes to its retail line in the 1990s, expanding its plus-size clothing lines and adding other lines catered to younger shoppers. A decision was also made to control the growth of stores, by only opening one or two a year. The chain's first Kentucky location, in Louisville, opened in 1994. In 1995, however, Jacobson's posted its biggest loss since 1977, and as a result, three Metro Detroit locations were closed and thirty-two workers were laid off. In addition, competitors Nordstrom and Parisian had begun opening locations in Detroit, increasing the chain's competition. Jacobson's also opened locations in Leawood, Kansas and Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nBy 1997, Jacobson's had twenty-four stores in operation. The chain began to promote its customer service and quality through marketing, and although the Midwestern locations continued to lose money, the Florida stores remained profitable. An East Lansing, Michigan location that opened in 1970 was relocated to a new store on the site of a former Service Merchandise at Meridian Mall in nearby Okemos in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, however, Jacobson's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed five stores, including one at The Fashion Mall at Keystone in Indianapolis, Indiana, as well as the Meridian Mall location. After failing to find a buyer, Jacobson's began liquidation on its last remaining stores, and was closed by the end of 2002. The Briarwood Mall store and another at Laurel Park Place in Livonia, Michigan were both sold to Davenport, Iowa-based Von Maur. In early 2004, Longwood, Florida-based Jake's Stores bought the naming rights and re-established Jacobson's in Florida.\n\nThe second incarnation of Jacobson's never saw the planned expansion ever take place. After nearly eight years of doing business as a one-store operation near the former Winter Park, Florida Jacobson's location, the \"new\" Jacobson's closed on December 21, 2011. Its owner, Tammy Giaimo, shuttered the one location with plans to open a store using a different name near another company she owned.\n\n"}

Edward Middlebrooks (born June 11, 1955 in Baltimore, Maryland), is an American politician. Most recently, he was a member of the County Council for District 2 of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. A Republican, he served as the Council's Chairperson until his term ended in December 2010.\n\nMiddlebrooks graduated from Glen Burnie High School in Glen Burnie, Maryland. He earned an Associate of Arts degree from Anne Arundel Community College, a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Baltimore in 1985 and a law degree from the University of Baltimore in 1988.\n\nMiddlebrooks is a criminal defense attorney who claims on his web site that he “handles all types of serious crimes, as well as traffic offenses, such as driving with a suspended driver’s license, driving after revocation, driving without insurance, reckless driving, and DUI” and has “successfully defended hundreds of clients facing serious criminal charges.” Middlebrooks is the sole partner in the Glen Burnie law firm known as C. Edward Middlebrooks, P.A..\n\nMiddlebrooks began his political career as a member of the Democratic State Central Committee from 1982 to 1990. This fact has been excised from much of the official state information as his official bios (County Council and Senate) either omit this information or incorrectly claim that he was on the Republican Central Committee. But the archives records it correctly.\n\nMiddlebrooks then served as a Democrat on the Anne Arundel County Council for the 2nd District from 1990 to 1994.\nIn 1994, Middlebrooks switched parties to challenge incumbent Senator Michael Wagner for the Dist. 32 state Senate seat. That year was a big year for the Republicans as they swept offices across the country, and almost won the Maryland Governor’s race. Middlebrooks beat Wagner for the senate seat. He was voted chairman of the Anne Arundel County Council in 1997. Then, in 1998, a poor year for Republicans in Maryland, Middlebrooks was challenged by Ed DeGrange. Middlebrooks lost to DeGrange days after an advertisement funded by the committee to support democratic candidate James Ed DeGrange was released. Directly attacking Mr. Middlebrooks, the literature depicted pictures of crying baby faces and accused Mr. Middlebrooks of being a bad role model for children. Due to the amount of time in which the ad was released, the rebuttal advertisement issued by the Committee to support republican candidate Ed Middlebrooks was not delivered before the election. Mr. Middlebrooks also was out of time to file charges of slander against James Ed DeGrange for the literature. In 2002 Mr. Middlebrooks ran again for the Anne Arundel County Council seat and won against Green Party candidate George Law and the incumbent Dan Klosterman after filing a lawsuit against Mr. Klosterman for attempting to redistribute the 1998 literature.\n\nMiddlebrooks' brother, Gary Middlebrooks, ran for his brother's seat in the Republican County Council primary in District 2 on Tuesday, September 14, 2010. Gary Middlebrooks lost by 87 votes to his opponent, John Grasso.\n\n\n"}

They congregate in large flocks at waterholes in dry regions to drink and bathe.\n\nTheir body feathers are darkest on the upper side, where they are coloured in dull tones of grey and brown, with shades of lavender on the nape. It is paler below, where a tint of pinkish lavender is usually present. The lower belly and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) is white. As with related species, they have white fringes and conspicuous white tips to the otherwise slate grey tail feathers. The tail pattern is particularly noticeable during the display flight.\n\nIndividual plumage variation is high, with some light and others almost sooty. Males and females look alike, although the males are slightly bigger. They measure in length and weigh . The eyes are almost black, the bill is black and the feet are dark purple.\n\nAn immature is duller and lacks the semi-collar of an adult. It also has buff edges to all the upper part and wing covert feathers, while the plumage below is broadly edged greyish-white.\n\nIt occupies a diverse range of habitat types, including semi-desert scrub, \"Boscia\" and \"Acacia\" savannah, a variety of woodland types, farmlands, open plantations and alien acacia thickets. Only closed forest or plantations, or the extensive waterless dune fields and gravel plains of the Namib are unsuited to their requirements. In southern Africa they are most commonly observed in fynbos regions, miombo and mopane woodlands, besides any grassland types from moist to dry regions. Their presence in the latter areas has been facilitated by the planting of trees in groves, for instance around farm homesteads.\n\nThey are vulnerable at exposed waterholes or in plantations where they are preyed on by lanner falcons and black sparrowhawks respectively. In addition they are preyed on by reptiles, wild cats, jackals, genets, herons, storks, eagles and barn owls. Nests are vulnerable to birds, snakes and locally, grey squirrel.\n\nSeasonal movements are most noticeable in tropical areas, while nomadic movements occur in arid environments with limited resources. They seldom occur above 2,000 metres.\n\nThese doves are usually found alone or in pairs, although they do form larger flocks around roosts or sources of food and water, sometimes comprising hundreds of birds. They are quite noisy in these groups, not only for the various calls they make throughout the day, or often into (mainly moonlit) nights, but also due to the loud clatter of their wings when they take flight.\n\nTheir song is a loud and harsh “\"kuk-COORRRR-uk\", ...” (sometimes interpreted as 'how's f\"a\"ther?' or 'work h\"a\"rder') which they may repeat ten to forty times. Less often a repeated “\"wuh-ka-RROOO\", ...” may be given. A raspy, snarling “\"kooorr\"”, or “\"knarrrrrr\"”, call is often given when it alights on a perch, arrives at an incubating mate or chases another dove away. Ring-necked doves roost in treetops during the night and forage for food on the ground by day. Peak foraging times are early morning and late afternoon, and they drink mainly in the morning. When they walk on the ground, their heads bob back and forth with each small step.\n\nThey feed mainly on seeds (of grasses, cereal grains, lupins, milkweeds, alien acacias and pines), but also on broken fruit and berries (of oaks, gums, currants and \"Lantana\"), and insects on occasion (earthworms, termites, weevils and other). Other recorded food items include small sedge bulbs, fleshy succulent leaves, aloe nectar and sugary aphid secretions.\n\nThey are monogamous, territorial nesters. Males display by flapping up a steep gradient before spiraling down with wings and tail spread out. From a perch or on the ground the male will engage in a bowing display, synchronized with a rolling crooning, “\"uk-carrroooo\", ...”, while the throat is inflated. A pair will give a double \"coo\" with a long second syllable when selecting a nest site. The female takes two to three days to construct the flimsy, platform nest. It is made of twigs and leaf petioles that are carefully selected by the male (as in other dove species), and delivered to her at the nest site. The nest is placed 2 to 10 meters above ground, on a horizontal branch fork. Quite often an old nest of another species may be used. Two to four pure white eggs are laid, and both sexes participate in the incubation that takes around two weeks. Chicks are fed regurgitated food by both parents and fledge after about 16 days. Several broods (up to 5) may be raised in a season.\n\nThere are six races. They differ mainly in plumage shade, with those of dry regions being paler and greyer. Western Ethiopian and South Sudan birds are sometimes separated from \"S. c. tropica\" as \"S. c. electa\" .\n\nA number of \"Streptopelia\" species are very similar in appearance, all having semi-collars and subdued plumage tones. The ring-necked dove is distinguished from its locally sympatric sister species, the African collared dove, by call, the paler bases of the tail feathers, and the grey rather than pink crown feathers.\n\nOn appearance alone it may also be confused with the Eurasian collared dove, vinaceous dove, red-eyed dove, red turtle dove, mourning collared dove or the Barbary dove, a popular cage bird with isolated feral populations. The red-eyed dove is generally similar with an identical display flight. It however has dark wine red eyes, is larger and darker altogether, with a grey belly and grey tail tips. The mourning collared dove has more grey about the head, and pale yellow eyes. The Eurasian collared dove was introduced into the US and is now found in nearly every state in the US, as well as in Mexico.\n\n"}

It was bought by Myer (later Coles Myer) in 1983. There were 25 stores across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory plus a few in Victoria, until they were re-branded under the Myer name in 2004.\n\nGrace Bros had a long and rich history of retailing in New South Wales, especially in Sydney following its founding by the Grace brothers, Albert Edward and Joseph Neal Grace, in 1885. The two brothers migrated from England in the 1880s and sold goods door-to-door. In 1885, they opened their first small shop in George Street, Sydney and by 1906, they had opened a five-storey building at Broadway (now the site of the Broadway Shopping Centre). In 1931, Joseph Neal Grace died and Albert Grace became Managing Director of Grace Bros. Prior to his death in 1938, Albert Grace planned suburban expansion of the Grace Bros stores from the City, a move which is considered the reason Grace Bros survived when many of their contemporaries perished such as Anthony Horderns and Mark Foy's. Isabel Grace died in 1970 at age of 86 years.\n\nSydney's major Grace Bros was located on Broadway. Through several different stores at varied locations in the city, the store first came to Bay Street in 1904. Subsequent additions and property purchases over the years culminated in the existing buildings being completed in 1923. Grace Bros boasted a store with, among many features, \"three and a half acres of furniture\"! The Grace auditorium dominated the social life of Sydney with dances, fashion parades, children's events displays and pantomimes held within it. 1954 saw the Royal Visit of Queen Elizabeth II with the Broadway stores extensively decorated. However, the centre of Sydney shopping gradually moved from Broadway into the current CBD around Market and Pitt Streets, and Grace Bros vacated the Broadway store in 1992. The building was resurrected as a multimillion-dollar retail and cinema complex in 1998.\n\nIn 1926, the Grace Brothers, Albert Edward and Joseph Neal Grace, purchased a block of land on the corner of York, Clarence and King streets in Sydney, on which they would build the \"Grace Building\", the jewel in the crown of their retail empire. They believed the site was perfectly positioned for the building they planned would become \"The Showpiece of the Company\", with new public transport routes and the coming Sydney Harbour Bridge turning York and Clarence Streets in the major city thoroughfares. Company letterhead even showed the building as being \"...on the Harbour Bridge Highway.\" Broadway had been affected by the shift of the city's commercial district toward Circular Quay and the changing public transport routes away from Sydney's South end, and so the Grace Building was to be the company's saviour. The Grace Building was officially opened by Sydney Lord Mayor Ernest Marks on 3 July 1930.\n\nYork Street never became the shopping thoroughfare the Grace Brothers had envisaged and, combined with the effects of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the building never lived up to expectations. By the onset of World War II Grace Bros was experiencing difficulty in leasing office suites and much of the space was allocated to government departments. In 1943 the Grace Building was requisitioned under national security regulations by the Federal Government for use as headquarters by the Supreme Commander of allied forces in the south-west Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur. In 1945, the Grace Building was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth. In 1995, it was purchased by the Low Yat Group of Kuala Lumpur for adaptive reuse as a 382-room hotel, opening in 1997.\n\nGrace Bros opened two small stores in suburban Sydney (in Westfield Parramatta and Westfield Bondi Junction) as early as in 1933; these stores were completely rebuilt and expanded in 1957 into the first department stores in Australia designed with the family car in mind.\n\nIn 1965, the Roselands Shopping Centre opened as one of the first major shopping centres in Australia. The centrepiece was a large Grace Bros department store. Suburban stores were subsequently opened at Stockland Mall Maroubra (became a clearance outlet from September 1994, closed 2002), Westfield Mount Druitt (opened 1973, closed June 2004), Westfield Hurstville (closed 24 January 2015), Westfield Miranda, Westfield Parramatta, Westfield Penrith, Ryde (closed 1985), Westfield Bondi Junction, Westfield Burwood (now a David Jones), Blacktown, Castle Hill, Westfield Hornsby (opened 1979), Westfield Liverpool, Carlingford Court (now a Target), Westfield Chatswood, Macquarie Centre and Westfield Warringah Mall.\n\nThe Castle Hill store which opened on 11 August 2001, was the final store to be opened under the Grace Bros brand and was also the final store to be designed in NSW, with a team at the Roselands support office overseeing all the plans and development.\n\nOver the years, Grace Bros opened and also acquired other stores as part of its expansion. Notable was the acquisition of publicly listed Queanbeyan and Canberra retailer, JB Young's during late 1979. The JB Young's stores traded under this name until mid 1986 when rebranded to Grace Bros. By acquiring JB Young's, Grace Bros also became the owner of the value positioned, apparel and manchester retailer Fossey's and benefited from stores JB Young's had acquired in their 1974 purchase of NSW retailer John Meagher & Co.\n\nThere was a specific \"Country Division\" within Grace Bros based in Canberra, established in 1985 at the time of the name change from Youngs to Grace Bros. The Country Division was responsible for regional merchandising at the stores including Kingston, Woden Valley, Dickson, Civic, Fyshwick, Quenbeyan, Goulburn, Cooma, and Batemans Bay. The Country Division also included former Myer (some of which were branded \"The Western Stores\"(Originally Western Stores & Edgelys, Acquired by Farmers & Co. early 1960. )) in Bathurst, Dubbo, Gosford, Orange, Wagga Wagga, Young, Cowra, Newcastle, Cessnock and Tamworth. New country stores were opened in Wollongong, Charlestown, Erina (relocated from Gosford). Both Newcastle and Cessnock closed when new store opened at Charlestown in 1989.\n\nSome of the stores that have closed include Goulburn (closed 1995), Ulladulla, Nowra (closed 2003), Tamworth (converted in 2003 to a Target), Bathurst (closed 2004), Cooma, Queanbeyan, Bairnsdale (after becoming a Myer, converted to a Kmart in 2004). In 1982 there were plans to open a Grace Bros. in Strathpine, Queensland but due to the take over of Myer NSW by Grace Bros. Holdings the store opened at the Strathpine Centre as a Myer in 1983 and remained opened until 2007. Myer Wollongong closed on 3 October 2016. Myer Orange closed on 29 January 2017, after 167 years of trading through various owners, 21 of those years it was branded Grace Bros.\n\nIn July 1982, Grace Bros sold its 57% shareholding in Norman Ross to Waltons. In April 1983 Grace Bros purchased most of Myer's New South Wales stores excluding Albury, Gordon, Miranda and Tweed Heads.\n\nHaving been the subject of a battle for control with the Adelaide Steamship Company, Bond Corporation, FAI Insurance, Myer, Westfield and Woolworths all buying and selling sizeable blocks of shares in 1982/83, Myer's takeover bid for Grace Bros was successful in June 1983. The Myer store on Market and Pitt Streets in Sydney became the main Grace Bros store. In 1985, the company became a division of Coles Myer, and the Grace Bros stores effectively merged with the 35 Victorian based Myer stores. In February 2004 a marketing decision was made to rebrand all the Grace Bros stores as Myer stores.\n\nGrace Bros Removals was established by Albert Edward and Joseph Neal Grace in Sydney in 1911. It was sold to Brambles who on-sold it in 1994 to Crown Worldwide Group.\n\n\n"}

He lived much of his early life with the Bedouin of Abu Dhabi. He was made Ruler of Abu Dhabi after the deposition of his cousin, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun, in 1855. He ruled for 54 years, until his death in 1909.He had a wife called Maitha Almansoori.\n\nEarly in his rule, Zayed guided Abu Dhabi through a series of conflicts with the Emirate of Sharjah. In 1868, during an armed clash with Sharjah's forces, he advanced ahead of his troops and challenged the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan Al Qasimi, to single combat. Zayed wounded Khalid mortally and the death of Khalid brought an end to the conflict - although outbreaks of internecine conflict continued to be the norm among the coastal communities.\n\nZayed also led Abu Dhabi in an extended war with Qatar in the 1880s that secured the western border of Abu Dhabi. He united with Omani forces to drive the Saudi troops from the Buraimi area in 1870. This left the forts defending the Buraimi Oasis in permanent control of Abu Dhabi and forced the Saudis to abandon their designs on Oman. Abu Dhabi's influence and control over this area steadily grew afterwards.\n\nIn 1895, Zayed saw in Al Zorah (today part of Ajman) an ideal base for supplying Bani Qitab forces loyal to him in conflicts with the Northern Sheikhs and applied to the British Resident for permission to move supplies there by sea. Unaware of the true reasons for the movement, the Resident gave permission but Zayed faced opposition in his scheme from other Sheikhs and was unable to complete the movement. In 1897, a section of the Sudan (singular Al Suwaidi) tribe under Sultan bin Nasser Al Suwaidi requested permission to settle Al Zorah with the support of Zayed (himself a Suwaidi on his mother's side and married to one of Sultan's daughters) and this was granted by the Resident.\n\nAlarmed by the scheme, the Ruler of Ajman built a fort at one of the waterways connecting Al Zorah with the mainland (it was at the time an island) and the Ruler of Sharjah, in 1890, appealed to the Resident to prevent this establishment of a non-Al Qasimi stronghold in the midst of his territory. This being upheld, to the annoyance of Zayed who had seen Al Zorah as an extension of his claim to the Northern coast, the scheme was abandoned and the decision to block it was subsequently upheld after a visit to Al Zorah by Major Cox, the British Political Resident.\n\nZayed was also noted by Percy Cox to be \"troublesome\" and guided the rest of the Sheikhs of Dubai and Umm Al Quwain to not adopt the White Pierced Red flag, the intended flag of the Truical States, referencing that the flag represents the Al Qawasim tribal federation.\n\nIn 1892, Zayed signed a treaty with the United Kingdom which effectively ceded control of Abu Dhabi's international commercial relations to the British.\n\nBy 1894, Zayed was considered the most powerful of the Trucial Sheikhs, replacing the hegemony of Sharjah.\n\nThrough strategic marriages he had many sons. The eldest of whom was named Khalifa, and had maternal heritage from the Manasir people.\n\nHe had a brother called Dhiyab who had three sons, Sultan, Mohammed, and Ahmed.\n\n\n"}

The Whizzinator comes as a kit complete with dried urine and syringe, heater packs (to keep the urine at body temperature), a false penis (available in several skin tones including white, tan, Latino, brown, and black) and instruction manual. The company also offered a female version of the Whizzinator, called \"Number One.\" There is no information on exactly how this product differs from the \"disposable unisex\" product also on the market. It was manufactured by Puck Technology of Signal Hill, California; a suburb of Los Angeles.\n\nThe device received media coverage in May 2005 in the United States after Onterrio Smith, a former Minnesota Vikings running back, was caught with one at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, which resulted in his suspension. Actor Tom Sizemore has also brought the Whizzinator into the public eye after having been caught with one attempting to evade drug tests.\n\nIn 2006, a Pittsburgh-area woman and her friend were charged with disorderly conduct and criminal mischief after they asked a convenience store clerk to microwave one of the devices so the woman could pass a drug test. The clerk, thinking it was a real penis, called police. The mischief charge was dropped after the friend agreed to replace the oven (OSHA regulations do not allow an oven to be used when bodily fluids are placed in it).\n\nThe United States Congress held hearings on the Whizzinator on May 17, 2005.\n\nThe Whizzinator continues to appear occasionally in news stories. In August 2015, a Chicago man on probation in Indiana was probably caught using the device to cheat on a mandatory drug test. He had gone to the probation office for Cook County, Illinois to take the test, and according to a police report repeatedly looked over his shoulder while urinating for the test, which drew the suspicion of a probation officer. \n\nOn October 14, 2008, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania won a 19-count indictment against Puck Technology, maker of the Whizzinator, and its owners for fraud and selling drug paraphernalia. Prosecutors allege that by manufacturing and selling the Whizzinator, Puck Technology, company president Gerald Wills and vice president Robert Catalano conspired to defraud the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which administers federal workplace drug testing programs. The government sought forfeiture of all of the company's assets, including its Internet domain names.\n\nOn November 24, Puck Technology, Wills and Catalano pleaded guilty in a Pittsburgh federal court to one count of conspiracy to defraud the government and one count of conspiracy to sell drug paraphernalia. Wills and Catlano were scheduled to be sentenced in February 2009. They faced up to eight years in prison and an $800,000 fine.\n\nIn April 2010, Wills was sentenced to six months of prison and Catalano was sentenced to three years of probation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1923217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923217", "title": "Deathcore", "text": "Deathcore\n\nDeathcore is an extreme metal subgenre that combines death metal with metalcore. Deathcore consists of death metal guitar riffs, blast beats, and metalcore breakdowns. Deathcore gained most prominence within the southwestern United States, especially Arizona and inland southern California (mostly the Coachella Valley), which are home to many notable bands and various festivals.\n\nDeath metal bands like Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Devourment, and Internal Bleeding all are credited as predecessors of deathcore for their use of breakdowns and influences from hardcore. Deathcore began in the early 2000s with early deathcore bands like Antagony, Despised Icon, and The Acacia Strain emerging at the time. The genre expanded in the mid–late 2000s with the emergence of bands like Through the Eyes of the Dead, Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Carnifex, Job for a Cowboy, Chelsea Grin and Whitechapel. In the mid–late 2000s, deathcore became one of the most popular genres in heavy metal with the success of bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Job for a Cowboy, Whitechapel and Carnifex. In the 2010s, deathcore bands fusing deathcore with other genres also emerged. This included bands like Emmure and Attila fusing deathcore with nu metal and bands like Veil of Maya and Born of Osiris fusing deathcore with progressive metal or djent. Deathcore received criticism from fans of heavy metal music, usually for its frequent use of breakdowns. Some deathcore musicians even rejected the deathcore label.\n\nDeathcore combines death metal characteristics such as blast beats, down-tuned guitars, tremolo picking, and growled vocals with metalcore characteristics such as breakdowns. The genre is usually defined by breakdowns and death metal riffs or metalcore riffs played in the usual death metal tuning. Like in other extreme metal fusion genres, deathcore guitarists down-tune their guitars to give their music a heavier sound. Deathcore bands may also employ guitar solos as well.\n\nLow growls and shrieked screams are common types of vocals in deathcore. Some other techniques that deathcore vocalists have used include what is known as \"pig squeals\". Sung vocals in the genre are rare and most bands seldom if ever use them, but the idea has been experimented with by a few bands such as All Shall Perish (in the song \"Awaken the Dreamers\") and Oceano (in the song \"Incisions\").\n\nThe term \"deathcore\" was first used in reference to the style of music played by New York hardcore punk band N.Y.C. Mayhem in the mid–1980s. By 1996, Nick Terry of \"Terrorizer\" magazine wrote: \"We're probably going to settle on the term \"deathcore\" to describe the likes of Earth Crisis (as well as the more NYHC-ish but still as deathly Merauder).\" \"Embrace the Eternal\" (1998) by Embodyment and \"Rain in Endless Fall\" (1999) by Prayer for Cleansing are albums that feature metalcore combined with death metal influences. \"Decibel\" magazine wrote that death metal band Suffocation were one of the main inspirations for the genre's emergence by writing: \"One of Suffocation's trademarks, breakdowns, has spawned an entire metal subgenre: deathcore.\" The Belgian H8000 scene was also influential to the development of the sound, with bands like Arkangel, Deformity, Reprisal, and Sentence helping to pioneer the genre in the late–1990s and early–2000s. When writing about deathcore pioneers Despised Icon, Dom Lawson of \"Metal Hammer\" wrote: \"blending death metal with hardcore was by no means a new thing when Despised Icon emerged.\" Suffocation bassist Derek Boyer says Suffocation \"were influenced by many early metal and hardcore bands\". Death metal bands like Dying Fetus, Devourment, and Internal Bleeding were influential on deathcore due to their use of \"crushing, mid-paced grooves and breakdowns\", according to Lawson.\n\nAntagony and Despised Icon are considered to be the pioneers of deathcore, However, both Antagony and Despised Icon have rejected the label. Nick Vasallo is credited as being the \"father of deathcore\" due to his work in Antagony. The Red Chord's formation is also considered an early influential source for the genre due to their hybridization of metalcore and death metal sounds (among other genres). In the mid 2000s, deathcore spiked in popularity shortly after Job for a Cowboy released their EP \"Doom\" in 2005, which is heavily credited as one of deathcore’s most significant and influential releases for the genre.\n\nEnglish band Bring Me the Horizon released their deathcore debut full-length \"Count Your Blessings\" in 2006. The band were presented the 2006 Kerrang! Award for \"Best British Newcomer\" shortly after the album's release, however the band abandoned the deathcore genre soon after. Deathcore band Through the Eyes of the Dead emerged in the mid-2000s with the release of their 2005 album \"Bloodlust\".\n\nDeathcore began to gain further popularity in the mid to late 2000s and early 2010s. Suicide Silence's \"No Time to Bleed\" peaked at number 32 on the \"Billboard\" 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart, while their album \"The Black Crown\" peaked at number 28 on the \"Billboard\" 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart. Whitechapel's album \"This Is Exile\" sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at position 118. Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart and also at number 47 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Their third album \"A New Era of Corruption\" sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album \"Dead in My Arms\", selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring, the band’s methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records. Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album \"Hate\" (2012) making them the first metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart.\n\nA variety of deathcore bands experimented with other genres into their music as influence and time progressed. Emmure has been credited to be heavily influenced by nu metal and was described as \"the new Limp Bizkit\". Suicide Silence's 2011 album \"The Black Crown\" is a deathcore album with some nu metal influences. Other examples of nu metal-inspired deathcore bands include Here Comes the Kraken's later material. In the early 2010s, deathcore bands that combine deathcore with genres like djent and progressive metal also began to achieve underground popularity. Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, and After the Burial are all examples of deathcore bands that combine deathcore with djent or progressive metal. Some bands, such as Make Them Suffer and Winds of Plague, mix deathcore with symphonic/classical elements. Betraying the Martyrs is known to \"temper the punishing brutality of deathcore with melodic flourishes pulled from symphonic and progressive metal, giving it a theatricality that feels distinctly European.\"\n\nDeathcore has been criticized and looked down upon, especially by longtime fans of some other heavy metal subgenres. The reason for it is often its fusion of death metal with metalcore and use of breakdowns.\n\nIn addition to this, members of certain deathcore bands do not take a liking to being labeled \"deathcore\". In an interview with vocalist Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain about the deathcore label, he said \"Deathcore is the new nu-metal. [...] It sucks. And if anyone calls us 'deathcore' then I might do something very bad to them.\" While in an interview with Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said \"You know, I really hate that term. I know we've been labeled as that but I think there's so much more to our music than just a mixture of death metal and hardcore (\"sic\") even though we incorporate those elements in our music. To me it seems that is just the new and fresh thing that kids are following.\"\n\nIn November 2013, \"Terrorizer\" wrote \"The term ‘deathcore’ is usually seen as a dirty word in metal circles\" while interviewing vocalist Bryce Lucien of the Texas-based metal band Seeker. Lucien then stated:\nIn contrast, there seems to be bands that appear to be more lighthearted and less concerned over being described as deathcore. Scott Lewis of the San Diego-based deathcore band Carnifex started \"We're not one of those bands trying to escape the banner of deathcore. I know a lot of bands try and act like they have a big problem with that, but if you listen to their music, they are very 'deathcore.' I know that there is a lot of resentment towards deathcore and kind of younger bands.\" Also, in a 2012 interview, former Chelsea Grin guitarist Jake Harmond said: \"Everyone likes to flap their jaw and voice their own opinion how 'embarrassing' it is to be in a band that can be labeled 'deathcore,' but honestly we have never given a fuck.\"\n\n"}

It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body. Ram pressure is given in tensor form as\n\nformula_1,\n\nwhere formula_2 is the density of the fluid; this is the momentum flux per second in the formula_3 direction through a surface with normal in the formula_4 direction. formula_5 are the components of the fluid velocity in these directions. The total Cauchy stress tensor formula_6 is the sum of this ram pressure and the isotropic thermal pressure (in the absence of viscosity).\n\nIn the simple case when the relative velocity is normal to the surface, and momentum is fully transferred to the object, the ram pressure becomes\n\nformula_7.\n\nThe Eulerian form of the Cauchy momentum equation for a fluid is\n\nformula_8\n\nfor isotropic pressure formula_9, where formula_10 is fluid velocity, formula_2 the fluid density, and formula_12 the gravitational acceleration. The Eulerian rate of change of momentum in direction formula_3 at a point is thus (using Einstein notation):\n\nformula_14\n\nSubstituting the conservation of mass, expressed as\n\nformula_15,\n\nthis is equivalent to\n\nformula_16\n\nusing the product rule and the Kronecker delta formula_17. The first term in the brackets is the isotropic thermal pressure, and the second is the ram pressure.\n\nIn this context, ram pressure is momentum transfer by advection (flow of matter carrying momentum across a surface into a body). The mass per unit second flowing into a volume formula_18 bounded by a surface formula_19 is\n\nformula_20\n\nand the momentum per second it carries into the body is\n\nformula_21\n\nequal to the Ram pressure term. This discussion can be extended to 'drag' forces; if all matter incident upon a surface transfers all its momentum to the volume, this is equivalent (in terms of momentum transfer) to the matter entering the volume (the context above). On the other hand, if only velocity perpendicular to the surface is transferred, there are no shear forces, and the effective pressure on that surface increases by\n\nformula_22,\n\nwhere formula_23 is the velocity component perpendicular to the surface.\n\nWhat is the sea level ram air pressure at 100 mph?\n\nρ = .0023769 sea level air density (slugs/ft)\n\nv = 147 (100 mph = 147 ft/sec)\n\nP = 0.5 * ρ * v\n\nP = 25.68 (pressure in lbf/ft)\n\nρ = 1.2250 sea level air density (kg/m)\n\nv = 44.7 (100 mph = 44.7 m/s)\n\nP = 0.5 * ρ * v\n\nP = 1224 (pressure in Pa = N/m)\n\nWithin astronomy and astrophysics, James E. Gunn and J. Richard Gott first suggested that galaxies in a galaxy cluster moving through a hot intracluster medium would experience a pressure of\n\nformula_24\n\nwhere formula_25 is the ram pressure, formula_26 the intracluster gas density, and formula_27 the speed of the galaxy relative to the medium. This pressure can strip gas out of the galaxy where, essentially, the gas is gravitationally bound to the galaxy less strongly than the force from the intracluster medium 'wind' due to the ram pressure. Evidence of this ram pressure stripping can be seen in the image of NGC 4402.\n\nRam pressure stripping is thought to have profound effects on the evolution of galaxies. As galaxies fall toward the center of a cluster more and more of their gas is stripped out, including the cool, denser gas that is the source of continued star formation. Spiral galaxies that have fallen at least to the core of both the Virgo and Coma clusters have had their gas (neutral hydrogen) depleted in this way and simulations suggest that this process can happen relatively quickly, with 100% depletion occurring in 100 million years to a more gradual few billion years.\n\nRecent radio observation of carbon monoxide (CO) emission from three galaxies (NGC 4330, NGC 4402, and NGC 4522) in the Virgo cluster point to the molecular gas not being stripped but instead being compressed by the ram pressure. Increased Hα emission, a sign of star formation, corresponds to the compressed CO region, suggesting that star formation may be accelerated, at least temporarily, while ram pressure stripping of neutral hydrogen is ongoing.\n\nA meteoroid traveling supersonically through Earth's atmosphere produces a shock wave generated by the extremely rapid compression of air in front of the meteoroid. It is primarily this ram pressure (rather than friction) that heats the air that in turn heats the meteoroid as it flows around it.\n\nHarry Julian Allen and Alfred J. Eggers of NACA used an insight about ram pressure to propose the blunt-body concept: a large, blunt body entering the atmosphere creates a boundary layer of compressed air which serves as a buffer between the body surface and the compression-heated air. In other words, kinetic energy is converted into heated air via ram pressure, and that heated air is quickly moved away from object surface with minimal physical interaction, and hence minimal heating of the body. This was counter-intuitive at the time, when sharp, streamlined profiles were assumed to be better. This blunt-body concept was used in e.g. Apollo-era capsules.\n"}

He was also a regular sparring partner for Mike Tyson, famously knocking down the then-undefeated world champion during a 1990 session.\n\nPage, after a brief stint with a Southern Indiana trainer, started amateur boxing at age 15 under the tutelage of Leroy Emerson at the Louisville Parks Department gym in the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood.\n\nHe first came to the public's attention by sparring several rounds with the iconic Muhammad Ali.\n\nIn 1976, at the USA–USSR Duals at the Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, Page scored a major victory when he defeated Igor Vysotsky, a top-ranked heavyweight amateur boxer in the world, who never has been knocked down, the big punching Russian who twice beat the legendary Cuban and three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Teofilo Stevenson. Page also beat James Tillis, Tony Tubbs, Mitch Green, and Marvin Stinson.\n\nBy that time he was the #1 ranked amateur heavyweight in the United States.\n\nAt the USA vs. socialist countries duals held in 1977-1978 Page defeated Polish Antoni Kuskowski on points (3–0), lost a 1–2 points decision to Cuban Angel Milián, stopped Romanian Mircea Șimon in the third round, defeated East German Juergen Fanghaenel on points.\n\nPage won the National AAU Heavyweight Championship in 1977. The following year, he repeated as the National AAU Heavyweight Champion and won the National Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championship.\n\n\nPage turned pro in February 1979, knocking out Don Martin in two rounds before a crowd of 7,500 at the Commonwealth Convention Center in Louisville. He put together 13 straight wins, 12 by knockout. The only fighter to go the distance with Page was George Chaplin, whom he defeated by a ten-round majority decision. Afterwards, Page was ranked in the top ten by the WBA.\n\nPage won the vacant USBA Heavyweight title on February 7, 1981 with a seventh-round TKO of Stan Ward.\n\nAfter knocking out Marty Monroe and Alfredo Evangelista, Page had a rematch with George Chaplin and won by a twelve-round split decision. He followed the Chaplin win with a fourth-round knockout of Scott LeDoux.\n\nPage retained the USBA belt with a unanimous decision over Jimmy Young on May 2, 1982. The following month, on the undercard of the Larry Holmes/Gerry Cooney fight, Page fought Trevor Berbick. Fighting with a broken right thumb from the second round, Page lost for the first time as a professional, dropping a ten-round unanimous decision to Berbick.\n\nPage returned to defend the USBA belt against contender James \"Quick\" Tillis in November 1982. After suffering the first knockdown of his career in the second round, Page came back to KO Tillis in the eighth round.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article, Butch Lewis had Page set up to fight the winner of Mike Weaver-Randy Cobb WBA world title fight in mid-to-late 1982, but Page had switched his allegiance from Lewis to Don King. In addition, Page had contacted his lawyer in March of that year to drop his ranking in the WBA from #2 to #3, behind Michael Dokes.\n\nIn 1983, Page retained the USBA title again, beating Renaldo Snipes over twelve rounds and taking his WBC #1 ranking. WBC heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, claiming the $2.55 million purse he was offered to fight Page wasn't enough, vacated the WBC title.\n\nIn March 1984, Page fought Tim Witherspoon for the vacant WBC belt. Incensed over money troubles with promoter Don King, Page had gone on strike in the gym and arrived out of shape for the bout. Witherspoon, who had lost a disputed decision to Holmes the previous year, pulled off an upset and took the title with a twelve-round majority decision. After the fight, Page fired Leroy Emerson as his trainer.\n\nPage returned in August with new trainer Janks Morton, and fought undefeated David Bey. Page lost his second fight in a row when Bey took a twelve-round unanimous decision.\n\nWhen Bey refused to fight reigning WBA heavyweight title holder Gerrie Coetzee in Sun City, South Africa due to Apartheid, Page stepped in. Page knocked Coetzee down twice before knocking him out in the eighth round to win the title, in a round that was unusual as it overran by a minute.\n\nPage made his first title defense against Tony Tubbs in Buffalo, New York on April 29, 1985. Page had beaten Tubbs six out of seven times in the amateurs and was the favorite to win, but Tubbs upset the odds and won by a fifteen-round unanimous decision. To make matters worse, Page's hotel room in Buffalo was burgled. Taken was Page's championship belt, a $13,000 watch, and a $10,000 mink coat belonging to his road cook.\n\nPage returned to face James \"Buster\" Douglas in January 1986. Douglas stunned Page and took a unanimous decision. Frequently out of shape, Page also lost to Orlin Norris in a title fight and even to the journeyman Mark Wills. \n\nPage became a regular sparring partner for reigning World Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson in the late 1980s and boxed on several of his undercards. Before Tyson's upset loss to Buster Douglas in February 1990, Page decked Tyson in a public sparring session. He was believed to be in line to fight Tyson when he lost to Wills.\n\nPage continued to fight and, in 1992, fought the Jamaican Donovan \"Razor\" Ruddock. Ruddock was returning after two big fights with Tyson that, due to the subsequent incarceration of Tyson, had established Ruddock as arguably the world's best heavyweight. Page gave Ruddock a hard time before being rocked by a series of big shots in the eighth round, which caused the referee to stop the contest.\n\nAfter defeating former WBA Heavyweight Champion James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith by a unanimous decision, Page was matched with former WBO Heavyweight Champion Francesco Damiani in September 1992. In a close contest, he lost two points for repeatedly losing his mouthpiece. The point deductions cost Page a draw: All three judges had Damiani winning by two points. In August 1993 Page boxed future WBA Heavyweight Champion Bruce Seldon and was stopped in the ninth round. He retired after the fight.\n\nAfter retiring, Page started training boxers. He worked with Oliver McCall and was in McCall's corner when he stunningly scored a second-round knockout of Lennox Lewis to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship in London on September 24, 1994 and was also present for McCall's infamous breakdown in the rematch with Lewis.\n\nHe trained boxers for several years, but grew restless. \"I was training boxers to fight guys I could beat myself,\" Page said.\n\nPage returned to the ring in May 1996. He went 16-0-1 with 15 knockouts before taking on Monte Barrett in October 1998. Barrett, 18-0 with 12 knockouts, won by a lopsided unanimous decision.\n\nAfter dropping a dubious decision to journeyman Artis Pendergrass, Page had a rematch with Tim Witherspoon in June 1999. The 40-year-old Page scored a first round knockdown and won when the 41-year-old Witherspoon tore a muscle in his back and couldn't come out for the eighth round.\n\nPage went 2-2 in his next four fights. He was well past his prime, but he continued to fight because he needed money. In 1998, Page filed for bankruptcy, claiming a $50,000 debt. By 2000, he was working his first 9-to-5 job, painting dental equipment at Whip-Mix Corp. in the South End of Louisville.\n\nOn March 9, 2001, Page fought Dale Crowe at Peel's Palace in Erlanger, Kentucky for $1,500. Page appeared to be holding his own with Crowe until the tenth round. Crowe said, \"The timekeeper smacked the mat with his hand toward the end of the fight to indicate ten seconds were left, and that's when I went after Greg with one last flurry.\" Crowe hit Page with a flush left to the chin and then pushed him back. Page fell against the ropes, slid down, and was counted out by the referee.\n\nWhat followed was chaos. There was no ambulance, no team of paramedics, nor oxygen, all of which were required by law. The ringside doctor, Manuel Mediodia, wasn't licensed in Kentucky and was under suspension in Ohio. At the time of the stoppage, Mediodia had already left and had to be brought back into the building. Twenty-two minutes passed before an ambulance arrived.\n\nBefore the fight, Page's trainer, James Doolin, complained to several members of the state commission about the conditions, including the lack of oxygen. He then wrote his complaints on a piece of paper and sealed it inside an envelope. Doolin gave it to the commission chairman, Jack Kerns, who then gave it back to Doolin. \"Mail it to me,\" Kerns said.\n\nPage was taken to the emergency room at St. Luke's hospital, where a CT scan revealed a huge mass being formed by the bleeding inside his head. He was then transported to University Hospital in Cincinnati. During post-fight brain surgery, he suffered a stroke and was left paralyzed on the left side of his body. Page was in a coma for nearly a week.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Page suffered many complications from his injury. He was hospitalized numerous times for such ailments as pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, hypothermia, and seizures.\n\nPage filed a lawsuit against the state of Kentucky and settled out of court for $1.2 million in 2007. As part of the settlement, boxing safety regulations the state enacted the previous year were named the \"Greg Page Safety Initiative.\"\n\nIn the early morning hours of April 27, 2009, Page died at home in Louisville.

{"id": "1923228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923228", "title": "Ethical movement", "text": "Ethical movement\n\nThe Ethical movement, also referred to as the Ethical Culture movement, Ethical Humanism or simply Ethical Culture, is an ethical, educational, and religious movement that is usually traced back to Felix Adler (1851–1933). Individual chapter organizations are generically referred to as \"Ethical Societies\", though their names may include \"Ethical Society\", \"Ethical Culture Society\", \"Society for Ethical Culture\", \"Ethical Humanist Society\", or other variations on the theme of \"Ethical\".\n\nThe Ethical movement is an outgrowth of secular moral traditions in the 19th century, principally in Europe and the United States. While some in this movement went on to organise for a non-congregational secular humanist movement, others attempted to build a secular moral movement that was emphatically \"religious\" in its approach to developing humanist ethical codes, in the sense of encouraging congregational structures and religious rites and practices. While in the United States, these movements formed as separate education organisations (the American Humanist Association and the American Ethical Union), the American Ethical Union's British equivalents, the South Place Ethical Society and the British Ethical Union consciously moved away from a congregational model to become Conway Hall and Humanists UK respectively. Subsequent \"godless\" congregational movements include the Sunday Assembly, whose London chapter has used Conway Hall as a venue since 2013.\n\nAt the international level, Ethical Culture and secular humanist groups have always organised jointly; the American Ethical Union and British Ethical Union were founding members of Humanists International, whose original name \"International Humanist and Ethical Union\" reflected the movement's unity.\n\nEthical Culture is premised on the idea that honoring and living in accordance with \"ethical principles\" is central to what it takes to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, and to creating a world that is good for all. Practitioners of Ethical Culture focus on supporting one another in becoming better people, and on doing good in the world.\n\nThe Ethical movement was an outgrowth of the general loss of faith among the intellectuals of the Victorian era. A precursor to the doctrines of the ethical movement can be found in the South Place Ethical Society, founded in 1793 as the South Place Chapel on Finsbury Square, on the edge of the City of London.\nIn the early nineteenth century, the chapel became known as \"a radical gathering-place\". At that point it was a Unitarian chapel, and that movement, like Quakers, supported female equality. Under the leadership of Reverend William Johnson Fox, it lent its pulpit to activists such as Anna Wheeler, one of the first women to campaign for feminism at public meetings in England, who spoke in 1829 on \"Rights of Women.\" In later decades, the chapel moved away from Unitarianism, changing its name first to the South Place Religious Society, then the South Place Ethical Society (a name it held formally, though it was better known as Conway Hall from 1929) and is now Conway Hall Ethical Society.\n\nThe Fellowship of the New Life was established in 1883 by the Scottish intellectual Thomas Davidson. Fellowship members included poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, animal rights activist Henry Stephens Salt, sexologist Havelock Ellis, feminist Edith Lees (who later married Ellis), novelist Olive Schreiner and Edward R. Pease.\n\nIts objective was \"The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all.\" They wanted to transform society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Davidson was a major proponent of a structured philosophy about religion, ethics, and social reform.\n\nAt a meeting on 16 November 1883, a summary of the society's goals was drawn up by Maurice Adams:\n\nAlthough the Fellowship was a short-lived organization, it spawned the Fabian Society, which split in 1884 from the Fellowship of the New Life.\n\nIn his youth, Felix Adler was being trained to be a rabbi like his father, Samuel Adler, the rabbi of the Reform Jewish Temple Emanu-El in New York. As part of his education, he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg, where he was influenced by neo-Kantian philosophy. He was especially drawn to the Kantian ideas that one could not prove the existence or non-existence of deities or immortality and that morality could be established independently of theology.\n\nDuring this time he was also exposed to the moral problems caused by the exploitation of women and labor. These experiences laid the intellectual groundwork for the ethical movement. Upon his return from Germany, in 1873, he shared his ethical vision with his father's congregation in the form of a sermon. Due to the negative reaction he elicited it became his first and last sermon as a rabbi in training. Instead he took up a professorship at Cornell University and in 1876 gave a follow up sermon that led to the 1877 founding of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, which was the first of its kind. By 1886, similar societies had sprouted up in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis.\n\nThese societies all adopted the same statement of principles:\nIn effect, the movement responded to the religious crisis of the time by replacing theology with unadulterated morality. It aimed to \"disentangle moral ideas from religious doctrines, metaphysical systems, and ethical theories, and to make them an independent force in personal life and social relations.\" Adler was also particularly critical of the religious emphasis on creed, believing it to be the source of sectarian bigotry. He therefore attempted to provide a universal fellowship devoid of ritual and ceremony, for those who would otherwise be divided by creeds. For the same reasons the movement also adopted a neutral position on religious beliefs, advocating neither atheism nor theism, agnosticism nor deism.\n\nThe Adlerian emphasis on \"deed not creed\" translated into several public service projects. The year after it was founded, the New York society started a kindergarten, a district nursing service and a tenement-house building company. Later they opened the Ethical Culture School, then called the \"Workingman's School,\" a Sunday school and a summer home for children, and other Ethical societies soon followed suit with similar projects. Unlike the philanthropic efforts of the established religious institutions of the time, the Ethical societies did not attempt to proselytize those they helped. In fact, they rarely attempted to convert anyone. New members had to be sponsored by existing members, and women were not allowed to join at all until 1893. They also resisted formalization, though nevertheless slowly adopted certain traditional practices, like Sunday meetings and life cycle ceremonies, yet did so in a modern humanistic context. In 1893, the four existing societies unified under the umbrella organization, the American Ethical Union.\n\nAfter some initial success the movement stagnated until after World War II. In 1946 efforts were made to revitalize and societies were created in New Jersey and Washington D.C., along with the inauguration of the Encampment for Citizenship. By 1968 there were thirty societies with a total national membership of over 5,500. However, the resuscitated movement differed from its predecessor in a few ways. The newer groups were being created in suburban locales and often to provide alternative Sunday schools for children, with adult activities as an afterthought.\n\nThere was also a greater focus on organization and bureaucracy, along with an inward turn emphasizing the needs of the group members over the more general social issues that had originally concerned Adler. The result was a transformation of American ethical societies into something much more akin to small Christian congregations in which the minister's most pressing concern is to tend to his or her flock.\n\nIn the 21st century, the movement continued to revitalize itself through social media and involvement with other Humanist organizations, with mixed success. As of 2014, there were fewer than 10,000 official members of the Ethical movement.\n\nIn 1885 the ten-year-old American Ethical Culture movement helped to stimulate similar social activity in Great Britain, when American sociologist John Graham Brooks distributed pamphlets by Chicago ethical society leader William Salter to a group of British philosophers, including Bernard Bosanquet, John Henry Muirhead, and John Stuart MacKenzie.\n\nOne of Felix Adler's colleagues, Stanton Coit, visited them in London to discuss the \"aims and principles\" of their American counterparts. In 1886 the first British ethical society was founded. Coit took over the leadership of South Place for a few years. Ethical societies flourished in Britain. By 1896 the four London societies formed the Union of Ethical Societies, and between 1905 and 1910 there were over fifty societies in Great Britain, seventeen of which were affiliated with the Union. Part of this rapid growth was due to Coit, who left his role as leader of South Place in 1892 after being denied the power and authority he was vying for.\n\nBecause he was firmly entrenched in British ethicism, Coit remained in London and formed the West London Ethical Society, which was almost completely under his control. Coit worked quickly to shape the West London society not only around Ethical Culture but also the trappings of religious practice, renaming the society in 1914 to the Ethical Church. He transformed his meetings into services, and their space into something akin to a church. In a series of books Coit also began to argue for the transformation of the Anglican Church into an Ethical Church, while holding up the virtue of ethical ritual. He felt that the Anglican Church was in the unique position to harness the natural moral impulse that stemmed from society itself, as long as the Church replaced theology with science, abandoned supernatural beliefs, expanded its bible to include a cross-cultural selection of ethical literature and reinterpreted its creeds and liturgy in light of modern ethics and psychology. His attempt to reform the Anglican church failed, and ten years after his death in 1944, the Ethical Church building was sold to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nDuring Stanton Coit's lifetime, the Ethical Church never officially affiliated with the Union of Ethical Societies, nor did South Place. In 1920 the Union of Ethical Societies changed its name to the Ethical Union. Harold Blackham, who had taken over leadership of the London Ethical Church, consciously sought to remove the church-like trappings of the Ethical movement, and advocated a simple creed of humanism that was not akin to a religion. He promoted the merger of the Ethical Union with the Rationalist Press Association and the South Place Ethical Society, and, in 1957, a Humanist Council was set up to explore amalgamation. Although issues over charitable status prevented a full amalgamation, the Ethical Union under Blackham changed its name in 1967 to become the British Humanist Association – establishing humanism as the principle organising force for non-religious morals and secularist advocacy in Britain. The BHA was the legal successor body to the Union of Ethical Societies.\n\nBetween 1886 and 1927 seventy-four ethical societies were started in Great Britain, although this rapid growth did not last long. The numbers declined steadily throughout the 1920s and early 30s, until there were only ten societies left in 1934. By 1954 there were only four. The situation became such that in 1971, sociologist Colin Campbell even suggested that one could say, \"that when the South Place Ethical Society discussed changing its name to the South Place Humanist society in 1969, the English ethical movement ceased to exist.\"\n\nThe organisations spawned by the 19th century Ethical movement would later live on as the British humanist movement. The South Place Ethical Society eventually changed its name Conway Hall Ethical Society, after Moncure D. Conway, and is typically known as simply \"Conway Hall\". In 2017, the British Humanist Association again changed its name, becoming Humanists UK. Both organisations are part of Humanists International, which had been founded by Harold Blackham in 1952 as the International Humanist and Ethical Union.\n\nWhile Ethical Culturists generally share common beliefs about what constitutes ethical behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged to develop their own personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.\n\nWhile the founder of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, was a transcendentalist, Ethical Culturists may have a variety of understandings as to the theoretical origins of ethics. Key to the founding of Ethical Culture was the observation that too often disputes over religious or philosophical doctrines have distracted people from actually living ethically and doing good. Consequently, \"\"Deed before creed\"\" has long been a motto of the movement.\n\nFunctionally, the Ethical Societies were organised in a similar manner to churches or synagogues and are headed by \"leaders\" as clergy. Their founders had suspected this would be a successful model for spreading secular morality. As a result, an Ethical Society typically would have Sunday morning meetings, offer moral instruction for children and teens, and do charitable work and social action. They may offer a variety of educational and other programs. They conduct weddings, commitment ceremonies, baby namings, and memorial services.\n\nIndividual Ethical Society members may or may not believe in a deity or regard Ethical Culture as their religion. Felix Adler said \"Ethical Culture is religious to those who are religiously minded, and merely ethical to those who are not so minded.\" The movement does consider itself a religion in the sense that\n\nThe Ethical Culture 2003 ethical identity statement states:\n\nSince around 1950 the Ethical Culture movement has been increasingly identified as part of the modern Humanist movement. Specifically, in 1952, the American Ethical Union, the national umbrella organization for Ethical Culture societies in the United States, became one of the founding member organizations of the International Humanist and Ethical Union.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the ethical societies consciously rejected the \"church model\" in the mid-20th century, while still providing services like weddings, funerals, and namings on a secular basis.\n\nWhile Ethical Culture does not regard its founder's views as necessarily the final word, Adler identified focal ideas that remain important within Ethical Culture. These ideas include:\n\n\nMany Ethical Societies prominently display a sign that says \"The Place Where People Meet to Seek the Highest is Holy Ground\".\n\nThe largest concentration of Ethical Societies is in the New York metropolitan area, including Societies in New York, Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester and Nassau County; and New Jersey, such as Bergen and Essex Counties, New Jersey.\n\nEthical Societies exist in several U.S. cities and counties, including Austin, Texas; Baltimore; Chapel Hill; Asheville, North Carolina; Chicago; San Jose, California; Philadelphia; St. Louis; St. Peters, Missouri; Washington, D.C.; Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and Vienna, Virginia.\n\nEthical Societies also exist outside the U.S. Conway Hall in London is home to the South Place Ethical Society, which was founded in 1787.\n\nEthical societies are typically led by \"Leaders.\" Leaders are trained and certified (the equivalent of ordination) by the American Ethical Union. Societies engage Leaders, in much the same way that Protestant congregations \"call\" a minister. Not all Ethical societies have a professional Leader. (In typical usage, the Ethical Movement uses upper case to distinguish certified professional Leaders from other leaders.) A board of executives handles day-to-day affairs, and committees of members focus on specific activities and involvements of the society.\n\nEthical societies usually hold weekly meetings on Sundays, with the main event of each meeting being the \"Platform\", which involves a half-hour speech by the Leader of the Ethical Society, a member of the society or by guests. Sunday school for minors is also held at most ethical societies concurrent with the Platform.\n\nThe American Ethical Union holds an annual AEU Assembly bringing together Ethical societies from across the US.\n\nThe tax status of Ethical Societies as religious organizations has been upheld in court cases in Washington, D.C. (1957), and in Austin, Texas (2003). In challenge to a denial of tax-exempt status, the Texas State Appeals Court decided that \"the Comptroller's test was unconstitutionally underinclusive and that the Ethical Society should have qualified for the requested tax exemptions... Because the Comptroller's test fails to include the whole range of belief systems that may, in our diverse and pluralistic society, merit the First Amendment's protection...\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was a strong supporter of the British Ethical movement, having been a Christian earlier in his life. He was a member of the Ethical Church and the Union of Ethical Societies (now Humanists UK), a regular attender at South Place Ethical Society. During his time involved with the Ethical movement, he chaired the annual meeting of the Ethical Union on multiple occasions and wrote for Stanton Coit's \"Ethical World\" journal.\n\nAlbert Einstein was a supporter of Ethical Culture. On the seventy-fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, in 1951, he noted that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. Humanity requires such a belief to survive, Einstein argued. He observed, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\"\n\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a regular attendee at the New York Society for Ethical Culture at a time when humanism was beginning to coalesce in its modern-day form, and it was there that she developed friendships with the leading humanists and Ethical Culturists of her day. She collaborated with Al Black, Ethical Society leader, in the creation of her nationwide Encampment of Citizenship. She maintained her involvement with the movement as figures on both sides of the Atlantic began to advocate for organising under the banner of secular humanism. She provided a cover endorsement for the first edition of \"Humanism as the Next Step\" (1954) by Lloyd and Mary Morain, saying simply that it was \"A significant book.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1923262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923262", "title": "Harlem Line", "text": "Harlem Line\n\nThe Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line, originally chartered as the New York and Harlem Railroad, is an 82-mile (132 km) commuter rail line running north from New York City into eastern Dutchess County. The lower 53 miles (86 km) from Grand Central Terminal to Southeast, in Putnam County, is electrified with a third rail and has at least two tracks. The section north of Southeast, sometimes called the Wassaic Branch, is a non-electrified single-track line served by diesel locomotives. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on the northern end of the line, except rush-hour express trains to and from Grand Central.\n\nWith 38 stations, the Harlem Line has the most of any Metro-North main line. Its northern terminal, Wassaic, is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by Amtrak, though CSX services freight customers as far north as Mount Vernon) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the color code blue, used as trim on station signs and spot color on printed timetables. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor New York Central for the then-Harlem Division as far back as 1965.\n\nWhile the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from Westchester County to jobs in the city, since the 2000s it has begun to see more \"reverse commuting\" from the Bronx into Westchester and points north. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to Western Massachusetts that residents in parts of that region are also able to commute to jobs in New York City.\n\nThe Harlem Line hews closely to roads along river-based transportation corridors dating back to even pre-rail times. It follows three major parkways closely from the Bronx northwards through Westchester: the Bronx River Parkway (and a short portion that becomes the Taconic State Parkway), the Saw Mill River Parkway and Interstate 684. In the last section it also begins to run close to NY 22, the long north-south two-lane state highway that parallels the eastern border of the state. In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at Grand Central Terminal, on the Park Avenue main line. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated viaduct starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at Harlem–125th Street, the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in Manhattan, entering the Bronx via the Park Avenue Bridge. The train tracks go into open-cut north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: Melrose, at 162nd Street (it then runs under the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95) and Tremont, at 177th Street. Fordham station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of Fordham University until the Botanical Garden station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The Williams Bridge station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, Woodlawn Cemetery begins to the west of the tracks, with Webster Avenue in between the cemetery and tracks. The Woodlawn station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the New Haven Line diverges to head east towards the Northeast Corridor.\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until Scarsdale station. The Wakefield station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\nThe Westchester portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern Yonkers. After the Mount Vernon West station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the Cross County Parkway eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the Bronxville station, the Harlem Line parallels the Bronx River Parkway all the way up to White Plains.\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at North White Plains, which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has grade crossings, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. Katonah and Brewster stations are located right next to grade crossings.\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is Valhalla adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the Saw Mill River Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at Mount Kisco, but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, Bedford Hills (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the Croton River and I-684. Golden's Bridge and Purdy's are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to Croton Falls, and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along East Branch Reservoir and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to Southeast station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of third rail electrification. \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements; however, positive train control was installed in the late 2010s. The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned Towners stations up to Patterson and into Dutchess County.\n\nShortly before reaching Pawling, the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crossing has its own stop to allow thru-hikers to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.\n\nThe next two stops, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, are roughly eight miles (13 km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to Tenmile River and its new northern terminus, Wassaic. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small yard where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the United States. It was franchised, on April 25, 1831, to run between the original city core in lower Manhattan to the suburb of Harlem, several miles to the north on Manhattan Island. The railroad's charter allowed the line to run between 23rd Street and any point on the Harlem River between Eighth and Third Avenue, with a branch running to the Hudson River, encompassing most of the island.\n\nWhile the company wanted to run the line as a steam line, the city made it use horsepower south of 14th Street. On September 13, 1831, the Board of Directors of the railroad approved its route along Fourth Avenue (renamed Park Avenue on March 1, 1888) from 23rd Street to the Harlem River. On April 6, 1832, the railroad's charter was amended to allow the line to be extended south to 14th Street.\n\nOn May 2, 1832 the City Common Council secretly granted the railroad the right to lay track along Broadway to City Hall and Bowling Green. There was a public outcry once this was found out by the general public, and at the time a fraudulent map was circulated showing that the railroad would take up of the street when it would only take up . Newspaper editors also came out against the railroad's plan. In Spring 1833, the railroad published a pamphlet to refute objections to their plan titled \"A Statement of Facts in Relation to the Origin, Progress, and Prospects of the New-York and Harlem Railroad Company.\" On March 1, 1833, a meeting was held in Tammany Hall concerning the issue, and at the meeting cab drivers and owners came out against the railroad. After the meeting, the crowd tore up some of the railroad's track. After the meeting, the council withdrew its Broadway agreement with the railroad. The railroad was extended downtown in 1839, but along a different route.\n\nGround was broken on the construction of the line on February 23, 1832 at Murray Hill on Fourth Avenue. At the ceremony, Vice President of the railroad, John Mason hinted at the railroad's ambitions saying that while the railroad's principal objective was local, its higher importance was to get to Albany. In 1832 the company was given permission to raise its stock limit to $500,000. In November, two horsecars built by John Stephenson were ready for operation, both of which were named after the railroad's president (\"John Mason\" and \"President\").\n\nOn April 27, 1837, an act was passed in the State Legislature to widen Fourth Avenue between 32nd Street and the Harlem River to provide room for the railroad. The street was widened by on either side, making the street wide. The company ceded the title for the land that would be occupied by Fourth Avenue to the city in exchange for permission to occupy it. In that same year, the railroad purchased six city lots at Fourth Avenue and 26th Street for $7,000 for the construction of car barns and stables.\n\nThe first section, along Bowery from Prince Street north to 14th Street, consisting of , opened to the public on November 26, 1832. On that day a demonstration showing the car's braking ability was conducted, but inadvertently, one horsecar rear-ended into another with no serious injuries. This might have been the first rear-end collision in the United States. Service was then extended northward along Fourth Avenue to 32nd Street on June 10, 1833. The Murray Hill rock cut was completed in 1834, and service along a -long segment to 85th Street in Yorkville opened on May 1, 1834. Service ran every 15 minutes between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m., and ran every 60 minutes to 10 p.m.. A one-way fare cost 12.5 cents Service was extended to finally reach Harlem on October 26, 1837, with the Yorkville Tunnel constructed to reach this point. At the time, Harlem was just a small suburb of the city. Service was also extended further south. On May 4, 1839, the line was extended south along Bowery, Broome Street and Centre Street to City Hall at Centre Street and Park Row. Service was extended south on November 26, 1852 along Park Row to Astor House at Park Row and Broadway.\n\nThe New York and Albany Railroad had been granted its charter on April 17, 1832, allowing it to build a single or double-track line from Greenbush (on the opposite side of the Hudson River from Albany) to New York along the Harlem River. In 1836 amendment to its charter granted it the right to enter Manhattan along a route that they \"may deem most eligible\"–direct competition to the NY&H. The NY&A had periods of inactivity, in part due to the financial panic of 1837. Surveys were completed in some places, and ground was proken in various areas. Gouverneur Morris, a Vice President and Director of the NY&A, reached an agreement with the Harlem. The NY&H would pay the NY&A's expenses on surveying with the understanding that the NY&H would be extended to Greenbush. The deal was completed on February 28, 1840, and on May 7, 1840, the New York State Legislature granted the Harlem the right to extend into Westchester. The corporate life of the NY&A ended on March 9, 1846 when it was bought by the Harlem.\n\nThe line was not being completed as quickly as its charter required, so the New York State Legislature granted it multiple extensions to allow for the work to be completed. The last time an extension was granted was on April 11, 1842. The New York and Harlem Railroad bought that company for $35,000 on March 9, 1846, as it had failed to make any progress on the construction of the line. The right-of-way and land for that line was sold as part of this transaction, on which, it built its line into Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, and Columbia Counties.\n\nService was extended into Westchester in multiple stages. The line was first extended north into Westchester on December 14, 1840, before reaching Fordham on March 1, 1841. Extended service reached Williams Bridge on September 3, 1842, and then in the summer of 1844, the line reached Tuckahoe. On December 1, 1844, the line's terminus became White Plains, but in October 1846, trains began ending their runs at Pleasantville. Service reached Mount Kisco and Croton Falls, in February 1847, and on June 1, 1847, respectively. On December 31, 1848, Harlem Railroad service was extended to Dover Plains, providing service to parts of Putnam County and Dutchess County.\n\nIn 1845, the railroad's charter was amended to allow the route to be extended north to Albany.\n\nOn May 10, 1852, the line was extended north to Chatham Four Corners in Dutchess County with a connection to the Boston and Albany Railroad, and trackage rights northwest to Albany. In the years following, the Harlem Railroad ran some of its trains over the Boston and Albany Railroad from Chatham to Albany. Additional connections could be made to railroads serving North Bennington, Vermont and other points in western Vermont. Chatham is about past the current terminal at Wassaic. In Boston Corners, about north of Wassaic, passengers could make connections to the Central New England Railway (CNE). To the east, the CNE went to Hartford, Connecticut. Westward, passengers could travel to Poughkeepsie, cross the Poughkeepsie Bridge, finally to Campbell Hall.\n\nA -long freight branch, from the 1853 purchase of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad, was built to Port Morris.\n\nWhen the Grand Central Depot opened in 1871, the depot that the line used was changed from being at 26th Street and Fourth Avenue to Grand Central Depot at 42nd Street.\n\nOn April 1, 1873, the New York and Harlem Railroad was leased for 401 years to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company. The line then became the Harlem Division of the New York Central. The lease did not include the portion of the line using horse cars. Horse cars were replaced with an underground trolley system in 1897 when it was leased to the Metropolitan Street Railway Company.\n\nIn 1875, the line was grade-separated and put in an open cut and a viaduct between Grand Central and the Harlem River to reduce the loss of life and to increase speeds. The work was completed for $6 million, of which half was paid by the city.\n\nOn May 15, 1876, partial rapid transit began on the Harlem Line, with sixteen trains a day running between Grand Central Depot and William's Bridge. These trains made all stops between Grand Central and William's Bridge, with the exception of Jerome Park, which was skipped by half of trains. This was in addition to eight regular trains per day that stopped at William's Bridge. Two new stations were opened at 86th Street and 110th Street, both being exclusively served by the rapid transit service.\n\nIn 1888, work began on a project to grade-separate the line from Mott Haven to Bedford Park, and to expand the line from two tracks to four tracks, with the additional tracks to be reserved or express trains, doubling the line's capacity. This project was funded entirely by the railroad, and was reached in an agreement with the New York City Department of Public Works, titled the \"Harlem Depression Agreement\" with the railroad paying for the construction of bridges over the now-depressed line. Service on the Harlem Line was expected to double. Express trains were expected to go at least , while locals were expected to go at least . of the line were put into a cut below the line's existing grade, starting north of 138th Street to north of Bedford Park station. Upon completion, there was a four track line from Woodlawn Junction to Grand Central. The line's cost was initially anticipated to be $2 million. On July 10, 1890, as part of the line's grade-separation project in the Bronx, the third track between Mott Haven and Fordham was completed. At the time, the four tracks between Woodlawn Junction and the Harlem River were almost completed, with a few hundred yards of rails needed to make some connections. The four tracks were expected to be completed on July 13. The New Haven Railroad planned to build a flyover at Williamsbridge for northbound trains so that their trains would not have to cross the other three tracks at grade. The rebuilt rapid transit stations were not yet completed. The entire project cost about $4 million.\n\nOn February 15, 1897, trains on the Harlem Division started running over the new drawbridge over the Harlem River and the elevated structure connecting to it. As part of the project, the line north of 106th Street to the Harlem River was elevated so that it could reach the height of the new four-track drawbridge, the only one in the country at the time. The project was known as the Park Avenue Improvement. The new line went via a steel viaduct, replacing a masonry viaduct and an open cut. The bridge was built for about $500,000 by the King Bridge Company. The new bridge is higher than the old bridge, as mandated by the Federal Government. During the course of construction, trains ran over a temporary wooden structure along with a temporary wooden drawbridge. The station at Mott Haven on the Bronx side of the Harlem River had to be elevated. The entire cost was $2 million.\n\nOn October 15, 1897, a spacious new station in Harlem was opened at 125th Street, replacing a small, dingy station in the old Park Avenue open cut. The new station was built atop the old open cut and directly under the new Park Avenue Viaduct. The platforms, which were built on the viaduct, were built to be long.\n\nAs part of the construction of Grand Central Terminal in the early 1900s, all of New York Central's lines that ran into the terminal were electrified. Third rail was installed on the Hudson and Harlem Divisions, while the New Haven Division received overhead wires on the segments that were not shared with the Harlem and Hudson Division. In November 1907, the first electric train operated on the Harlem Division, running between Grand Central Terminal and Wakefield. On October 10, 1909, the New York Central began installing third rail between Mount Vernon and White Plains. On March 14, 1910, electric service was extended to North White Plains. Passengers that used the Upper Harlem Division were attracted to this cleaner, faster service. Property values along the line increased. Other improvements were made to the Harlem Division at the same time: grade crossings were being eliminated, tracks were being straightened, and new stations were built at White Plains and Mount Vernon.\n\nIn 1910, a yard dating back to the 1870s in Dover Plains was relocated to Putnam Junction in Brewster.\n\nOn October 18, 1930, the Public Service Commission (PSC) listed the elimination of a grade crossing in Amenia, Benson crossing, as one of its projects to consider. The cost estimate for eliminating it was $100,000. \n\nThe New York Central operated the \"Berkshire Hills Express\" and several other through trains to Pittsfield and North Adams along this route, then the NYC's Boston & Albany mainline to Pittsfield, then the B&A's North Adams branch to North Adams into the mid-1940s with dining service.\n\nStops beyond Chatham towards North Adams, Massachusetts included: \n\nIn 1950, the through service to North Adams was trimmed to a shuttle from Chatham to North Adams, requiring a transfer at Chatham. Passenger service between Chatham and North Adams ended in 1953.\n\nOn September 12, 1952, the New York Central's last steam-powered train run in the metropolitan area ran on the Harlem Division, being replaced by diesel locomotives. However, they began wearing out in the 1970s, leading to a decline in service.\n\nOn December 20, 1956, the state opened up bids for the elimination of grade-crossings in Pleasantville. Planned for 25 years, it was expected to cost $3.857 million. The crossings to be eliminated were at Manville and Bedford Roads. The tracks were lowered for and the two roads were bridged over the railroad. The station at Pleasantville was moved.\n\nOn August 12, 1960, the PSC ordered the New York Central to continue the level of service to Chatham until it determined how much service was required. The Central had wanted to cut one train each way daily, leaving only one round trip.\n\nStarting on October 25, 1961, some trains became equipped with two-way radio communication on the Harlem Line to test the technology with the hope of adding them to all commuter trains on the New York Central. They were meant to be used when delays in service occurred.\n\nOn January 10, 1964, the PSC approved plans by the New York Central to implement zoned fares in the southern part of the New York commutation area (north to North White Plains). The plan went into effect on January 22. Though it was meant to be experimental, and to last one year, this was kept in place.\n\nAt the end of World War II, private rail service began a sharp decline with the start of the Jet Age and the construction of the Interstate Highway System. NYC, facing declining year-over-year profits, merged in 1968 with its former rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad, forming the Penn Central Transportation Company. Penn Central continued to lose money and attempted several maneuvers to delay bankruptcy, including auctioning off the air rights of Grand Central Terminal; the Pennsylvania Railroad had done the same thing to Penn Station. However, this approval was denied, and the denial was affirmed in \"Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City\", a 1978 decision by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn May 1970, Penn Central planned to discontinue service from Dover Plains to Chatham when Amtrak declined to take over that service. However, the Attorney General maintained that this service was within the commuter area, and therefore not subject to discontinuation. Without the objection, this service would have been eliminated on May 1, 1971 when the Amtrak passenger service went into effect. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) held hearings on this in May 1971, and it ruled on June 28, 1971 that the service to Chatham was intercity–not commuter. On that same day, a bill that would have extended the power of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to Chatham was vetoed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. On July 31, 1971, Penn Central announced that it would discontinue all service to Chatham the following day. The railroad claimed that it lost $300,000 a year on the one round trip between Chatham and Grand Central.\n\nThe Attorney General appealed the ICC's ruling, and this appeal was tried in March 1972, but failed, resulting in the discontinuation of service from Dover Plains to Chatham on March 20, 1972. Penn Central operated the last southbound passenger train between Chatham and Grand Central Terminal on March 20, 1972, ending service in the middle of the day. Train 935, which was scheduled to leave Grand Central at 4:25 PM and run to Chatham was cut back to Dover Plains. With no scheduled return trip to Chatham, passengers who had gone south in the morning were left stranded, with service going only as far north as Dover Plains (52 miles shy of Chatham). Tracks were removed north of Millerton shortly thereafter. The cutback of service to Chatham was strongly opposed by the Harlem Valley Transportation Association (HVTA), which was led by Lettie Gay Carson.\n\nPrior to the discontinuation of service to Chatham, the quality of service on the line decreased. Trains that could once run the to Chatham in 2 hours 45 minutes now took 3 hours and 45 minutes. Service had been decreased from five trains a day to one train in each direction. As service was discontinued, a bill was put before the State Legislature that would have authorized the state to run trains to Chatham between New York and Montreal and from Albany toward Boston. The bill did not pass.\n\nSeveral other stations had their service discontinued in 1972, including: 138th Street, Morrisania, and 183rd Street stations in the South Bronx, and Holland Avenue station in White Plains, although that one was replaced.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) leased the line south of Dover Plains from Penn Central on June 1, 1972. On March 28, 1980, the last freight train ran between Dover Plains and Millerton, and the line was abandoned three days later after the line's largest shipper decided to switch to using trucks. All freight service ended in 1993. Tracks were removed from Wassaic to Millerton. In 1989, New York State purchased of the right-of-way between Wassaic and Copake Falls for the development of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail. The segment of the line that ran from Wassaic to Craryville, New York is now under control of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail Association, which has trails between Wassaic to the former Millerton station and between Under Mountain Road and Copake Falls, known as the Harlem Valley Rail Trail.\n\nIn April 1971, a project to install high-level platforms at stations along the Harlem Line started. This was necessary as the new Metropolitan cars did not have any stairs to reach the low-level platforms. By having high-level platforms, dwell times could be cut in half. Most of the new platforms were built as island platforms. These cars started entering into service in September 1971. At the same, time reverse signaling was installed to allow trains to use either track in either direction, enabling both tracks to be used in one direction during the peak of the rush hour. On September 10, 1974, the MTA announced that work would start on the construction of high-level platforms at eleven stations in Manhattan and the Bronx including at the Wakefield, Woodlawn, Williamsbridge, Botanical Garden, Fordham and Tremont stations on the Harlem Line. The entire project cost $2.8 million. The work was expected to be completed in the late summer of 1975. As part of the work the stations on the Harlem Line received -long cast-in-place concrete platforms. The abandoned station building at Woodlawn was removed as part of the project. On March 15, 1975, these cars started stopping at the Melrose, Tremont, Fordham, Botanical Garden, Williamsbridge, Woodlawn and Wakefield stations on the Harlem Line with the partial completion of their high-level platforms. However, initially they only served the stations during weekends and early mornings and evenings on weekdays until the platform work was completed.\n\nThe extension of electric service to Brewster had been discussed since the late 1920s. Numerous improvement studies were undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of extending electrification north from North White Plains. In 1976, the MTA undertook a study on the existing traction power system and it identified extending electric service to Brewster as a priority. In December 1978, the MTA applied to the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) for $30 million in funding to extend electrification along the Harlem Line from North White Plains to Brewster North, which became a stop on August 3, 1981, (now known as Southeast). The MTA's application for funding was granted, with the remainder of the money coming from a New York State bond issue from 1974.\n\nOn February 8, 1980, Metro-North announced its plan to extend electrification to Brewster. On November 25, 1980, the MTA's chairman, Richard Ravitch, announced that $3 billion should be spent to expand and improve transit service. As part of the plan he proposed extending electrification to Brewster, for which planning was underway, and proposed building a third track along the Harlem Line between North White Plains and Mount Vernon West for $30 million. On February 5, 1981, UMTA approved the contract for the third rail required for the project. For an additional $45 million, high-level platforms were installed to reduce dwell times, and electric substations were built to supply the power needed for third-rail operation. The project was approved by Governor Hugh Carey after Upper Harlem Line riders and commuter organizations–dissatisfied by the line's service–petitioned for the project. Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new M3As. Work on the project was completed during off-peak hours to allow for service on the line to be maintained. Thirteen of the stations received new high-level center island platforms. Mount Pleasant station got side platforms, while the station at Thornwood was closed because of excessive curvature of the track, which would have resulted in a large gap between the train and the platform. The new stations received glass-enclosed overpasses and elevators.\n\nThe first electric train ran on April 30, 1984, beginning at Brewster North. As additional new M3As were put into service that spring, electric service increased. On September 1, 1984, a new schedule was put out, and running times decreased by 18 minutes on peak hour trains. On September 10, 1984, super express service was inaugurated on the Harlem Line, with some trains running non-stop between Katonah and Grand Central. The last diesel train left Brewster on November 2, 1984, marking the completion of the electrification project.\n\nAs a result of the project, there was tremendous ridership growth on this portion of the line. Prior to the project, the line was operated primarily in two zones: electric service south of North White Plains, and diesel through-service or shuttle service consisting of Budd Rail Diesel Cars to the north. Service to the north of Brewster North–the new terminal for electric service–continued to be run with diesel through-service or shuttle service. Between 1984 and 1994, the Brewster and Brewster North stations– the two northernmost stations in the electrified zone–experienced 135% growth, and stations on the Dover Plains Branch experienced 440% growth.\n\nThe introduction of new coaches allowed for improvements in service on the Dover Plains Branch. The first peak through service since the 1970s was inaugurated in October 1991. At the same time, a Sunday night through train was added. The reduced travel times made the line more attractive to commuters. In 1994, Metro-North conducted a train movement analysis of service on the branch to determine whether trains would pass one another based on speeds and the condition of tracks. As a result, a new passing siding was constructed at Wingdale, increasing service flexibility and allowing for increased service in 1996. Also around this time, 447 additional parking spaces were added to stations on the Branch. In 1996, four car length high-level platforms with heated shelters were built at Patterson, Pawling, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, replacing low-level platforms that could only accommodate two cars. These platforms were made to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Travel times could be reduced further as it would take less time for passengers to exit and board the trains.\n\nA new station, Appalachian Trail, was built in 1990 for the cost of $10,000. Its creation was the suggestion of George Zoebelein, who was an avid hiker and a veteran of the NY/NJ Trail Conference as well as both the NY/NJ Appalachian Trail Conferences, and also served as a member of the Metro-North Railroad Commuter Council (MNRCC) of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee (PCAC) to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It is one of three limited service stops operated by Metro-North primarily for hikers – the other two being Breakneck Ridge and Manitou on the Hudson Line. This is the only rail station on the -long trail.\n\nOn December 9, 1992, the ICC authorized Conrail to convey its freight rights on the Harlem Line north of North White Plains to the Danbury Terminal Railway Company (DTRC). In 1995, the ICC directed the DTRC to discontinue freight operations on the line, as it had not been used for freight service in several years.\n\nIn 1993, Metro-North announced plans to restore service north of Dover Plains to Wassaic. Initially, the project was estimated to cost $12.8 million. The extension was intended to help revive the community of Wassaic, and to turn it into a hub where passengers would come from Litchfield County in Connecticut, the Berkshires in Massachesetts, and from Vermont.\n\nOn October 19, 1995, the town of Amenia passed a resolution supporting the Harlem Line's extension by to Wassaic.\n\nOn January 23, 1997, Metro-North acquired the property necessary for the extension of service on the Upper Harlem Division to Wassaic. In August 1997, the Final Environmental Impact Study for the Wassaic extension was completed, recommending that preferred option, the extension of service to Wassaic be completed. One of the rejected alternatives, was the restoration of service to Millerton and Mount Riga in Dutchess County. A layover yard would have also been built as part of this alternative. This alternative was rejected due to the presence of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail, and replacing it with rail service would have required an in-kind replacement of any taking of parkland. Since a majority of the line was not owned by Metro-North it was viewed as being cost-prohibitive. In July 1998, Metro-North announced the names for the new stations on the extension: Tenmile River and Wassaic.\n\nIn April 1999, the MTA put out bids to purchase signal equipment to go along of the line from Brewster to Wassaic. The signal system was bi-directional with cab signaling.\n\nOn July 9, 2000, Metro-North restored service between Dover Plains and Wassaic, a move the railroad billed as its first service expansion since it was created in 1983. As part of the project, the trailhead of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was moved from milepoint 81.6 to milepoint 82. of right-of-way had to be acquired from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historical Preservation. To make up for this loss, $490,800 was received by the Transportation Enhancement Program to design and construct an access pathway from Wassaic station to the new trailhead. Wassaic was designed as and is a regional transportation hub for people living and going to Dutchess County in New York, Litchfield County in Connecticut and for Western Massachusetts. The station was built with a 250-space parking lot that, with expansion, could have 1000 parking spaces, and with a layover yard, and a light maintenance facility. One of the goals of the expansion was to provide additional parking capacity for the line. Prior to the opening of the yard at Wassaic, trains terminating at Dover Plains had to deadhead 23 miles to get to the yard at Southeast, reducing capacity on the line, while being very costly. A station was also opened at Tenmile River to serve the Taconic Developmental Disabilities Service Office. Under an alternative plan, this would have been the terminus of the line. In order to build ridership, the extension has received the same amount of service as has the line south of Dover Plains, with four AM and four PM rush hour trains with direct service to Grand Central. In fact, since 1984, weekday ridership on trains to Dover Plains increased by 463 percent to a total of 535 people riding south daily. The extension cost $6 million. The extension also eased the commutes of people coming from Massachusetts.\n\nEarly in 1994, Metro-North announced plans to build a third track along of the Harlem Line between Mount Vernon West and Crestwood to increase capacity and to eliminate a bottleneck. At the time, Harlem Line ridership was growing, with an expected 31 million people using the line in 2020. Without the construction of an additional track, only one southbound peak-hour train could have been added without cutting local service, express service, or reverse peak service. In August 2001, construction on the $57 million project began. The project was completed in 2004. The Fleetwood and Crestwood stations were expanded through the adding of island platforms to allow for the third track to stop there. The right-of-way was wide enough to fit the third track, requiring no taking of property. The plan for the installation of a third track was first conceived in 1989, but it was faced with strong community opposition due to concerns over noise and vibrations. Once opened, the third track resulted in improved service. Reverse-peak trains were able to run every 30 minutes instead of every 90 minutes, helping fuel a 30 percent increase in ridership along the line through Southern Westchester and the Bronx. Most of the new reverse-peak users came from the Bronx. The increased service helped revitalize White Plains' downtown, helping anchor the economy of central Westchester. Express trains could skip stops via the express track while additional local trains could make stops in Westchester and the Bronx.\n\nOn November 13, 2018, the MTA announced its intent to purchase the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a discount rate of 6.25%. The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central. At the time, the Hudson and Harlem Lines were owned by a holding company that had taken possession of Penn Central's assets upon its bankruptcy, while the Grand Central Terminal was owned by Midtown TDR Ventures. Under the terms of the leases for each asset, the MTA would only be able to exercise an option to purchase the three assets before October 2019. The MTA's finance committee approved the proposed purchase on November 13, 2018, and the purchase was approved by the full board two days later. The deal finally closed in March 2020, with the MTA taking ownership of the terminal and rail lines.\n\nFollowing this purchase, the entirety of the Harlem Line is owned by the MTA. The segment north of Dover Plains was previously acquired in 1990 when Harlem Line service was extended on this trackage.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, a Harlem line train struck a car on the tracks near Valhalla and caught fire, killing six people.\n\nWith the entire existing track in use (since service to Wassaic was restored in 2000), there is little talk of expansion or branching. However, Metro-North will revisit a future extension northward if circumstances change. When plans were drawn up for extending the line northward from Dover Plains, the goal for Metro-North was to extend the line as far north as possible for a new yard, and to attract the most new passengers. Wassaic was the best site, and service was not extended to Millerton as the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was using the right-of-way. This directly contrasts one of the main purposes of rail trails: to preserve the right-of-way to allow for rail service to be restored in the future. \n\nIn the 2015–2034 MTA Twenty-Year Capital Needs Assessment, two possible Harlem Line projects that would provide capacity to deal with increasing ridership and to expand service are mentioned. The first is the extension of a third track from Crestwood north to North White Plains. This would allow for increased reverse-peak service, increased local and express service-the same goals of the original third track project from Mount Vernon West to Crestwood. The second project would be the construction of a new flyover at Woodlawn at the junction with the New Haven Line. However, funding for these projects has not been identified as there are ongoing needs to maintain basic infrastructure.\n\nThe Harlem Line currently has no operational branches. Under New York Central ownership, it previously operated a branch to Lake Mahopac to a connection with the Putnam Division. This line was originally a subsidiary known as the New York and Mahopac Railroad (1871-1880), and had one station between the two lines in Lincolndale. The line opened on June 17, 1872, and it extended to Golden's Bridge. It cost $266,000 to build it. After the discontinuance of passenger service on the Putnam Division in 1958, the Central operated a shuttle service known as \"around the horn\" which continued on Putnam Division trackage north of Lake Mahopac to Mahopac, Carmel, and Brewster where it reconnected with the Harlem Division main line. This service lasted until 1959. The only active remnant of this branch is a wye north of Brewster station known as Putnam Junction. There are some remains of the right-of-way of the branch, including a bridge just west of the Golden's Bridge station, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nNorth of Brewster is a connection with Metro-North's Beacon Line, which was purchased by Metro-North in 1995 for preservation for future use. There are currently no plans for branch service on this line, which runs north and west to Hopewell Junction, and then south and west to Beacon. It also runs east to Danbury, but a reverse move would be required. In October 2000, Metro-North undertook a study to determine whether it was feasible to restore passenger service to the line between Hopewell Junction and Brewster. Service, if operated, during peak hours, would have run directly to Grand Central, while they would have run as a shuttle during other times, ending at Southeast. The introduction of the line would have reduced ridership on the Wassaic Branch by 20%. Two shuttles would have run exclusively on the Beacon Line, while three Upper Harlem Line trains would have been extended from Southeast to Hopewell Junction. The study determined that at the time it did not make sense to restore service on the line.\n\nThe freight-only Port Morris Branch split from the Harlem Line within the South Bronx in the southbound direction. The Port Morris branch was part of a line which was originally part of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad which was established in 1842. The railroad was bought by the New York and Harlem Railroad in 1853, and the segment north of Mott Haven Junction became part of the NYC Hudson Division. The Port Morris Branch began at a wye north of Melrose Station, then extended southeast through The Hub, through a tunnel under St. Mary's Park, and finally Port Morris along the East River just after crossing a bridge beneath the Harlem River and Port Chester Branch of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The only two stations along this branch were at Westchester Avenue between Brook and St Mary's Avenues and at Port Morris itself across the river from North Brother Island. After the construction of the Oak Point Link at the Bronx's southern tip and its subsequent opening in 1998, trains stopped operating along the Port Morris Branch in 1999. Formal abandonment was declared in 2003, when CSX Transportation declared that the branch could be vacated due to the lack of use in the preceding two years.\n\nOn the electrified portions of the line, M3As and M7As are usually used. As with the Hudson Line, diesel-powered trains are operated by dual-mode Genesis and BL20-GH locomotives, paired with Shoreliner coaches. While some peak-period trains operate directly to and from Grand Central Terminal, most Harlem Line diesel-only territory is operated as shuttle service between Southeast (where electrification ends) and Wassaic, north in Dutchess County.\n\nBuilt by the New York and Mahopac Railroad in 1871, the Lake Mahopac Branch diverges from the Harlem Line north of Goldens Bridge and merged with the now-defunct Putnam Division south of Mahopac. Known to some residents of Mahopac as the “Golden’s Bridge Branch”. The entire branch was abandoned on April 2, 1959.\n\nThe entire line was used exclusively for freight. It diverged from the Harlem Line at Melrose and terminated at Port Morris, east of the Oak Point Yard. The line was formally abandoned in 2004.\n\n\n"}

Launched in 1995 as ETV 2, it was a sister channel of ETV 1. The channel's owner Extra Terrestrial Vision (Private) Limited, who had been incorporated on 6 July 1992, changed its name to EAP Network (Private) Limited on 30 April 1996 following the acquisition by EAP. At that time ETV 2 was re-broadcasting Star TV. ETV 1 was re-launched as Swarnavahini, a mass market Sinhala language channel, on 16 March 1997. ETV 2 was re-launched as ETV on 1 May 1998. EAP Network (Private) Limited changed its name to EAP Broadcasting Company (Private) Limited on 16 May 2012, EAP Network (Private) Limited on 31 October 2012, EAP Network Limited on 28 August 2013 and EAP Broadcasting Company Limited on 11 September 2013.\n\nETV is available on free-to-air on analogue terrestrial transmission via UHF channel 35 in the Colombo area and UHF channel 40 in the Kalutara area. It is also available on Lanka Broadband Networks cable TV and PEO TV IPTV (channel 5).\n\nETV started in late 1991 as a branch of Mirco-Wave Communication Systems (Private) Limited (MCS) (Sri Lanka Registrar of Companies # NPVS9093). MCS was a subsidiary of East-West Enterprises and was the primary reason for the E in ETV (East West Television). The original board of MCS and Later ETV consisted of 4 persons - namely, Nahil Wijesuriya, Captain Lester Weinman, Uoosoof Mohideen and Priyanke de Silva. These four names are in the registrar of companies register for both ETV and Micro-Wave communication systems.\n\nIncidentally, Nahil's alma-mater is Trinity College, Kandy while the other three studied at St. Peter's College, Colombo 4.\n\nThe logo of ETV depicted in this article (and has the colours of East West Enterprises) was designed by Nahil Wijesuriya in his office at the Robert Senanayake Building in Nawam Mawatha, Colombo 2.\n\nPriyanke (Anthonus) de Silva (Priyanke Research) met Uoosoof Mohideen at the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies in August 1990. Priyanke and Uoosoof became friends and it was Uoosoof who invited Priyanke to join MCS as a Consultant Engineer for ETV, which was headed at that time by Mr. Roshan Rupesinghe. Soon after joining, Roshan Rupesinghe migrated to Australia at which point Nahil invited Priyanke to be the CEO/Managing Director of MCS.\n\nProgramming for ETV was by down linking AsiaSat1 programs by a 50-foot diameter concrete dish built by Nahil (for which he owned a patent) at an East-West property in Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka. The AsiaSat1 signal was very weak (approx -19db to -23db) and the 50-foot dish enabled ETV to provide 'broadcast quality' programs. Incidentally, MCS sold self-manufactured glass-fibre dishes of 16-foot diameter for residential use (including hotels).\n\nA microwave, line-of-sight, link from Peliyagoda to Station Rd, Colombo 4 (SET building) fed the content to the broadcasting studio/station on the 17th floor of the SET building.\n\nDuring this period East-West Enterprises split into two entities and Captain Lester Weinman and Mr. Nahil Wijesuriya went separate ways with Lester getting control of the Robert Senanayake Building and Nahil getting the IBM Building (Thaakshana Mandiraya) in Navam Mawatha, Colombo 2 and Nahil got total control of MCS and ETV. Nahil moved his office to the Thaakshana Mandiraya (IBM building).\n\nUoosoof Mohideen is/was the CNN representative for Sri Lanka and later joined Dynavision Broadcasting Corporation re-branded as ART TV as CEO upon exiting from MCS/ETV. Incidentally, Priyanke did some ground work for CNN during this time on measuring the CNN signal quality, etc.\n\nPriyanke also exited ETV and MCS, before Uoosoof's exit and the primary reason was that he wanted to go back to concentrating on his core business and other ventures, including as a technology consultant for another East-West (Nahil) owned enterprise.\n\nNahil continued on with ETV and later sold ETV to EAP Holdings.\n"}
{"id": "1923271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923271", "title": "Paris by Night", "text": "Paris by Night\n\nParis by Night is a direct-to-video series featuring Vietnamese-language musical variety shows produced by Thúy Nga Productions. Hosted mainly by Nguyễn Ngọc Ngạn and Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Duyên, the series includes musical performances by modern pop stars, traditional folk songs, one-act plays, and sketch comedy.\n\n\"Paris By Night\" was conceived by immigrant Tô Văn Lai in 1984, in Paris, France, to \"fill the cultural void\" as a result of fleeing Vietnam in the Vietnam War. Shortly afterwards, the show's production company transferred to Orange County, California, which has a large Vietnamese community.\n\nThe show is set up with \"melodramatic performances, catchy pop tunes, Vaudeville-esque comedy, and elaborate set designs\", with a large emphasis of production focusing on expressing Vietnamese culture. In recent years, the rising popularity of K-pop and J-pop has applied creative pressure to Thúy Nga CEO Marie Tô, who responded by insisting on keeping with the Vietnamese style, commenting \"Of course, K-pop is very big now…but we kind of want to create our own image. The singer[s] we produce, we want to create their image—not imitating K-pop or anything.\" The show has since been noted as not only a form of entertainment, but a \"way to connect to a larger identity\".\n\nWhile most of the staff and crew remain the same from show to show, the directors may vary based on the filming location. For example, Richard Valverde served as director for shows in Paris, Michael Watt directed shows in Canada and the United States, and Victor Fable directed in the United States. Notable directors include The Voice's Alan Carter, who directed six shows in the United States, CEO of production company A. Smith & Co. Kent Weed, of six shows in the United States, and NBC director Ron de Moraes who directed four shows.\n\nStarting with \"Paris by Night 34: Made in Paris\", Shanda Sawyer has been working as the production's main choreographer.\n\nOriginally, \"Paris by Night\" was filmed exclusively in Paris, with its intended target audience consisting of the Vietnamese population in France. However, by the late 1980s, the production moved to Orange County, California (specifically James Irvine Intermediate), as a result of demand from the more populous Vietnamese American community for the production to host shows in the United States and the fact that most Vietnamese language performers from the former South Vietnam lived in the country, with filming beginning in the country in the mid-1990s.\n\nWith the exception of two shows, \"Paris by Night\" has been filmed live before an audience. The show has since been filmed in France, the United States, Canada, South Korea and Singapore.\n\nSince the beginning of the show's run, the producers have been releasing videos of the shows on VHS and, more recently, DVD. Since the digital age, however, \"Paris by Night\" sales have dropped significantly, and the company has since switched to a video on demand service and a subscription services similar to Netflix. Full shows and music clips have been made on the official Thúy Nga YouTube channel, supported with ad revenue. The company has also allowed IP addresses in Vietnam to stream shows for free, countering the country's ban on the show's sales. Production coordinator John Nguyen states “All the copies in Vietnam are bootleg or through illegal downloads.\"\n\nWhen first produced in the 1980s, the show was made for Vietnamese people who had been living in France in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the show found a larger audience in the United States by the late 1980s. As a result of the digital age of the 21st century, the show has become more readily accessible online. According to Thúy Nga, the main demographic of the shows consisted of people under the age of 40. Presenter Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Duyên commented on the show's popularity in Vietnam, noting \"We actually give the Vietnamese audience in Vietnam a very high level of entertainment unmatched by what they have now.\"\n\nAs an overseas Vietnamese production and classified as a \"reactionary cultural product\" by the Vietnamese government, \"Paris by Night\" cannot be legally purchased in Vietnam, although unauthorized copies can be easily obtained in the black market. It sometimes features performances that are related to historical events, critical of the ruling Vietnamese Communist Party. In 2004, in \"Paris by Night 74\", Hoang Oanh sang a song about Operation Passage to Freedom and a video montage was shown depicting beleaguered-looking northern Vietnamese fleeing to the anti-communist south during the partition of Vietnam, where they were met by Ngô Đình Diệm and his government's officials. This performance coincided with the 50th anniversary of the migration. In 2005, \"Paris by Night 77\" was devoted to the 30-year anniversary of the Fall of Saigon, and included songs explicitly critical of communist rule, lack of human rights, accompanied by montages of the closing stages of the Ho Chi Minh Campaign, the flight of distressed anti-communist refugees, and interpretative dancing critical of VCP rule, such as throat-slitting gestures. It also included documentary segments on the progress of Vietnamese immigrant communities since 1975, including one segment praising American support for South Vietnam and Operation Babylift—the communist government views the babylift of orphans as \"abduction\"—and gave awards to Vietnamese humanitarians and American political officials who helped Vietnamese refugees, as well as the Republic of Vietnam Air Force fighter pilot Nguyễn Qúy An.\n\nIn \"Paris by Night 91\", for the 40th anniversary of the Tet Offensive, one medley involved Quang Lê singing about the beauty of the former Huế, backed by female dancers, before an explosion knocks them and the bridge over the Perfume River to the ground, something perpetrated by the communists during the Battle of Huế during the Tet Offensive. Khánh Ly then proceeded to sing Trịnh Công Sơn's \"Song for dead bodies\" about the communist massacre at Huế, which killed thousands. A video montage of the massacre, inconsolable relatives and the subsequent exhumation and religious reburial was shown in the background during Khanh Ly's performance.\n\nIt is also the subject of some controversies among the overseas Vietnamese population due to what some perceive as its support of the current government of Vietnam. \"Paris by Night 40\", with the topic of motherhood, featured a song by the composer Trịnh Công Sơn titled \"Ca Dao Me\", which was performed by Don Hồ. The song included a reenactment of a bombing during the Vietnam War and showed a mother grieving over the death of her child and her husband. Some were offended by the song's antiwar message while others see this as an indictment against American and South Vietnamese troops even though the scene did not make it clear which side was doing the bombing. After a boycott, Thúy Nga reissued \"Paris by Night 40\" with the bombing scenes removed. \"Paris by Night 40\" is the most commercially successful production. The director of the segment, Lưu Huỳnh, later went on to direct \"The White Silk Dress\" in Vietnam, a film with similar themes.\n\nIn \"Paris by Night 96\", Thúy Nga Productions's Nguyễn Ngọc Ngạn wrote a skit about a Vietnamese American gay kid, starring Bang Kieu. This sparked conversations among Vietnamese American parents and their gay children. It helped build more tolerance for Vietnamese American gay lesbian bisexual and transgender community overseas. This shows the company's cultural influence over the Vietnamese American culture, experience and audience.\n\nThere has also been increasing recent criticism of the production over-Americanizing its shows, with traditional Vietnamese culture and aspects no longer being emphasized as before, as well as the production largely losing its original French cabaret influence and roots. In fact, \"Paris by Night\" has not been filmed in its namesake city since 2003, Paris by Night 70.\n\n"}

He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball, playing at every position, including 585 games at second base, 544 games in the outfield, and 178 games at third base. Richardson played for six major league teams, with his longest stretches having been for the Buffalo Bisons (1879–85), Detroit Wolverines (1886–88) and Boston Reds (1890–91).\n\nRichardson appeared in 1,331 major league games, compiled a .299 batting average and .435 slugging percentage, and totaled 1,120 runs scored, 1,688 hits, 303 doubles, 126 triples, 70 home runs, 822 RBIs, and 377 bases on balls. From 1881 to 1888, he was part of the \"Big Four\", a group of renowned batters (the others being Dan Brouthers, Jack Rowe, and Deacon White) who played together in Buffalo and Detroit and led Detroit to the National League pennant and 1887 World Series championship.\n\nRichardson was born in 1855 at Clarksboro, which is located in the existing municipality of East Greenwich Township, New Jersey. His father, Robert D. Richardson, was a New Jersey native who worked in 1870 as a house carpenter. His mother, Naomi (Jones) Richardson, was a Pennsylvania native. Richardson grew up in Greenwich Township, Gloucester County, and Gloucester City, New Jersey. By 1870, Richardson, at age 15, was working on a farm.\n\nRichardson began playing organized baseball with semipro teams in South Jersey and Philadelphia in the early 1870s. In 1875, he played at third base and catcher for the Gloucester City, New Jersey club. For a portion of the 1876 season, he played with the Philadelphias, but that team disbanded in July 1876. Richardson next played for the \"Crickets\" from Binghamton, New York, during the 1876 and 1877 seasons. In 1878, he played for the Utica, New York club in the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players. While playing for Utica, the New York \"Clipper\" called him the best fielding center fielder in baseball; he also won \"The Clipper medal for best fielding average.\"\n\nRichardson joined the Buffalo Bisons of the National League in 1879 and remained with Buffalo for seven years from 1879 to 1885.\n\nAs a rookie, Richardson made his major league debut on May 1, 1879, and promptly became Buffalo's starting third baseman. He compiled a .283 batting average, earned a 2.5 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating, and ranked fifth in the National League with 10 triples and fourth with 16 bases on balls. He also led the league's third basemen in games played (78), double plays turned (13), and errors (44), and ranked second at the position in assists (153), putouts (83), and fielding percentage (.843).\n\nIn 1880, Richardson was again positioned at third base. He saw his batting average drop to .259 and his WAR rating drop to 1.1. He still hit for power and ranked among the league leaders with eight triples (10th) and 26 extra base hits (10th). Defensively, his performance suffered as he ranked second among the league's third basemen with 47 errors and saw his Defensive WAR rating dip into negative territory at -0.7.\n\nAfter a poor defensive performance in 1880, Richardson was moved to the outfield in 1881. With the move, his batting average jumped to .291, and his WAR rating bounced back to 2.5 -- 10th best among the league's position players. Showing good power, he ranked among the league leaders with nine triples (3rd), 53 RBIs (4th), 29 extra base hits (9th), 62 runs scored (10th), 100 hits (10th), and 142 total bases (10th). The move to the outfield also suited Richardson defensively. He led the league's outfielders with 45 assists and a range factor of 2.84 and ranked third with 179 putouts. Richardson's total of 45 outfield assists (in only 79 games at the position) was five short of Orator Shafer's major league record and remains the third highest season total in major league history.\n\nIn 1882, and despite his solid defensive performance in the outfield, Richardson switched positions for the second time in as many years. This time, he was moved to second base, where he played 83 games. Richardson handled the move reasonably well, as he led the league's second basemen with 275 putouts and ranked second with a 6.69 range factor and 63 errors. He also hit .271, earned a 2.2 WAR rating and ranked fourth in the league with 57 RBIs.\n\nFrom 1881 to 1888, Richardson was one of four Buffalo (later Detroit) infielders with Dan Brouthers, Jack Rowe, and Deacon White who were known in baseball as the \"Big Four.\" The \"Big Four\" played together for eight years and were \"regarded for many years as the greatest quartette in the history of the national pastime.\" \"The Sporting News\" later wrote; \"How the Big Four was admired! Even in hostile cities the fans praised them in the next breath after they had jeered them.\"\n\nRichardson remained the Bisons' second baseman in 1883, playing all 92 of his games at the position. His 4.1 WAR rating in 1883 was the second highest in his career and the ninth highest among the National League's position players. He ranked among the league leaders with a .311 batting average (10th), .347 on-base percentage (9th), 34 doubles (5th), 42 extra base hits (9th), and 146 times on base (9th). Defensively, he led the league's second basemen with a career high 6.88 range factor, and ranked second at the position in assists (344) and putouts (289). However, he also ranked second at the position with a career high 68 errors.\n\nIn a game against Philadelphia on July 20, 1883, both Richardson and Jack Rowe were credited with home runs when outfielder Conny Doyle was unable to find balls they hit into a patch of deep of grass in the left field corner.\n\nDuring the 1884 season, Richardson played 71 games at second base and 24 in the outfield, as the \"Big Four\" led Buffalo to a third place finish and a 64–47 (.577) record – the highest winning percentage in the club's history. All four players had outstanding seasons, combining for an 18.6 WAR rating. The chart below tracks the WAR rating of the \"Big Four\" during their eight seasons together.\n\nRichardson was involved in another unusual circumstance in a game against the Chicago White Stockings on August 13, 1884. Chicago's George Gore was instructed by player-manager Cap Anson to avoid the double play. When the next batter hit a ground ball, Gore tackled Richardson at second base before he could complete the relay throw. The umpire called both the batter and the runner out, and Anson protested the ruling and refused to resume play, leading the umpire to declare the game forfeited to Buffalo. The two teams then agreed to resume a game which had been postponed earlier in the season, as a way of placating the dissatisfied fans. In the later game, Anson decided to demonstrate of the right way to break up the double play. He reached first base, and when the next batter hit a ground ball to Richardson, Anson waved his arms while running to second in an effort to interfere with Richardson's throw. Possibly flustered by this display, Richardson in turn struck Anson square in the head with his throw, which was delivered hard enough that it bounced all the way into the grandstands. A woozy Anson was forced to leave the game.\n\nDuring the 1885 season, Richardson split his time between second base (50 games) and outfield (48 games), and even appeared in one game as a pitcher – compiling a 2.25 earned run average in four innings pitched. He ranked among the league leaders with a .319 batting average (4th), .458 slugging percentage (4th), 11 triples (7th), six home runs (7th), 195 total bases (7th), 90 runs scored (8th), and 3.9 Offensive WAR rating (8th).\n\nIn mid-September 1885, the Detroit Wolverines purchased the \"Big Four\" from Buffalo, paying $7,000 for entire team. League officials initially halted the sale, but ultimately allowed it to proceed, provided the Big Four did not play for Detroit until the start of the 1886 season. Richardson responded to threats to void the transaction by saying that the \"Big Four\" would \"retire to Canada\".\n\nThe merger of the Detroit and Buffalo line-ups turned two losing teams (Buffalo was 38-74 in 1885, Detroit 41-67) into one of the best in the game. With the addition of the \"Big Four\", the Wolverines improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85-38 record. For Richardson, the 1886 season was the best of his career with a 7.0 WAR rating – the fourth highest among the National League's position players. He led the league with 189 hits and 11 home runs and was among the league leaders with a .351 batting average (5th), .402 on-base percentage (6th), .504 slugging percentage (4th), 125 runs scored (4th), 271 total bases (3rd), 27 doubles (7th), 11 triples (8th), 49 extra base hits (4th), and 42 stolen bases (4th). He also had the second highest ratio of at bats to strikeouts at 48.9. Defensively, Richardson played at multiple positions during the 1886 season, including 80 games in the outfield, 42 at second base, and four as a pitcher (12 innings, 4.50 ERA).\n\nThe 1887 season was the pinnacle in the eight-year history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. In an article published in 1911, Richardson called the 1887 Detroit team \"one of the grandest collection of hitters ever seen together.\" Richardson contributed another strong season, splitting his playing time between second base (64 games) and outfield (59 games), and compiling a 3.8 WAR rating. He was again among the league leaders with a .328 batting average (6th), 131 runs scored (3rd), 178 hits (3rd), 263 total bases (3rd), 18 triples (6th), 94 RBIs (7th), and 51 extra base hits (9th). Despite playing only 64 games at the position, he also led the league's second basemen with a 6.78 range factor.\n\nDuring the 1888 season, the Wolverines finished in fifth place with a 68-63 record. Richardson's playing time was limited to 58 games at second base, and his batting average and WAR rating to .289 and 2.1 – Richardson's lowest numbers since 1880. With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines sold Richardson along with Charlie Bennett, Dan Brouthers, Charlie Ganzel and Deacon White to the Boston Beaneaters for an estimated $30,000.\n\nDuring the 1889 season, Richardson played for the Boston Beaneaters, appearing in 86 games as a second baseman and 46 as an outfielder. He compiled a .304 batting average and 3.9 WAR rating and ranked among the National League leaders with 122 runs scored (8th), 163 hits (9th), 47 stolen bases (8th), and 10 triples (10th). He also had the second highest range factor (6.47) among the league's second basemen. In his only season with the Beaneaters, he helped the team to a second place finish with an 83-45 record.\n\nIn 1890, Richardson and teammate Dan Brouthers played in the newly-formed Players' League, joining the Boston Reds. The pair helped the Reds win the first and only Players' League pennant with an 81-48 record.\n\nRichardson was a strong supporter of the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. In January 1890, he spoke out against players like teammate John Clarkson who had joined the Brotherhood but remained with their old clubs. Richardson said he would remain loyal to the Players' League even if it could only pay him $10 a week and added: \"I held up my hand and swore that I would stick to the brotherhood... I respect my word and regard my oath as sacred. You have no idea how hot it makes me to think of the way some of these players have acted.\"\n\nRichardson played in the outfield for the Boston Players' League club, appearing in 124 games at the position. He compiled a .326 batting average in 1890 and led the Players' League with a career high of 146 RBIs. He also stole 42 bases and ranked among the league leaders with 13 home runs (2nd), 274 total bases (4th), 181 hits (5th), and 126 runs scored (10th). He also set a major league record in July 1890 by hitting home runs in five consecutive games, a record that was unmatched until Babe Ruth accomplished the feat in 1921.\n\nAt the end of the 1890 season, the Players' League disbanded, but the Boston Reds remained a major league club in 1891 as part of the American Association. Richardson again played in the outfield for the 1891 Reds, but he was limited to 74 games, having been laid up at his home in Gloucester City, New Jersey, after suffering a broken bone in his foot. His batting average fell by 71 points to .255, and his WAR rating of 1.0 was the lowest of his career to that time. He did not rank among the American Association's leaders in any major offensive or defensive category, though he ranked second in the league with a ratio of 39.7 at bats per strikeout.\n\nRichardson played briefly for the Washington Senators in 1892. He appeared in 10 games, compiled a .108 batting average and was released by the Senators on April 28, 1892. Richardson was then signed by the New York Giants of the National League. He appeared in 64 games for the Giants, 33 of them at second base, and compiled a .214 batting average. He was released by the Giants late in the season, having appeared in his final major league game on September 10, 1892, at age 37.\n\nFrom May to June 1898, Richardson made a brief comeback at age 43 as a player for the Utica Pent-Ups in the New York State League.\n\nIn his 14 years in major league baseball, Richardson appeared in 1,331 major league games, compiled a .299 batting average and .435 slugging percentage, and totaled 1,120 runs scored, 1,688 hits, 303 doubles, 126 triples, 70 home runs, 822 RBIs, and 377 bases on balls. His best season was 1886 when he led the National League in home runs and compiled a 7.0 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating, the fourth highest among all position players in the National League. His career WAR rating was 40.5.\nIn the 1894 \"Reach Guide\" to baseball, Jim Hart, who was Richardson's manager in 1889 with the Beaneaters, offered the following high opinion of Richardson: \"I think Ed Williamson and Hardy Richardson would pretty nearly make a tie as to being the best ball player since professional base ball has existed.\" Baseball historian Bill James in 2001 ranked Richardson as the 39th-best second baseman in the history of baseball in \"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\".\n\nIn January 1886, Richardson was married in a ceremony at Utica, New York, to Lillie M. Davis. In reporting on the wedding, \"The Sporting News\" wrote: \"Mr. Richardson's fame as a ball player extends from Maine to California, and is only surpassed by his genial gentlemanly bearing and manner, which have earned for him the best wishes of innumerable friends for his future happiness.\" Richardson and his wife had a daughter, Dorothy, born in 1895. After retiring from baseball, Richardson reportedly operated a hotel in Utica, New York. By 1900, he was living in Utica with his wife, Lillie, and their daughter, Dorothy, and he was employed as an \"art glass stainer.\" By 1905, Richardson and his wife had moved to German Flatts and later to Ilion, both in Herkimer County, New York, where he worked for the Remington Typewriter Company.\n\nIn late 1910 and early 1911, Richardson wrote about his baseball memories in a series of articles for the Hearst newspapers.\n\nBy 1930, Richardson was retired and living with his wife in Utica as boarders at the home of cement salesman, Robert C. Weaver. Richardson died in January 1931 at age 75 in Utica, New York. He was buried at the Forest Hill Cemetery in that city.\n\nRichardson was referenced in a first-season episode of the HBO television series, \"Boardwalk Empire\", in October 2010. The lead character, Nucky Thompson, portrayed by Steve Buscemi, noted that he had owned an autographed catcher's mitt signed by Hardy Richardson when he was a child. It was stolen from him by older, bigger kids. After his father made him fight four older boys to get it back, Nucky was beaten unconscious and spent 11 days in the hospital.\n\n"}

Secondari, and was directed by Jean Negulesco, who also directed the 1954 film \"Three Coins in the Fountain\". Ann-Margret sings four songs composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen.\n\nThe film was nominated for one Academy Award: Music (Scoring of Music—Adaptation or Treatment) for Lionel Newman and Alexander Courage.\n\nThree beautiful American women come to Madrid and fall in love. Susie Higgins (Pamela Tiffin) arrives and moves in with her old friend Maggie Williams (Carol Lynley) and roommate Fran Hobson (Ann-Margret). Susie experiences a culture shock, when she is informed by Maggie and Fran that all rich, attractive men are taken, and all attractive but poor ones are too proud to take on American women.\n\nIt becomes clear to Susie that she is nothing like her roommates. Maggie, for instance, is a secretary who has recently ended an affair and is now in love with her married boss Paul Barton (Brian Keith), much to the dismay of her co-worker Pete McCoy (Gardner McKay), a newspaper man. Fran, an aspiring actress, flamenco dancer and singer, stumbles upon an attractive Spanish doctor Dr. Andres Briones (André Lawrence) and immediately falls for him, even though he does not seem to be interested. In contrast, Susie implies in conversation with her roommates that she is a virgin and tells them, \"Don't spread it around!\"\n\nWhile at the Museo del Prado, Susie catches the eye of wealthy playboy Emilio Lacayo (Anthony Franciosa). Homesick, she is comforted by the kind words of Emilio and dismisses Maggie's warnings that he is a \"corrupt, heartless man.\"\n\nDuring a party, where Fran delivers a musical performance, Susie is surprised by Emilio's interest in another girl and his lack of attention for her. Maggie is upset that a dance between her and Paul is interrupted by his jealous wife Jane (Gene Tierney). She asks Pete for a ride home and learns his plans to leave Madrid for Paris, which is caused by his dislike of Paul. Feeling that he is behaving too much like a playboy, Maggie admits that she thinks that Pete could be a great newspaper man if he tried.\n\nThe next morning, Susie attempts to take revenge on Emilio with a devious plan. Fran offers to aid her, but when she crosses paths with Dr. Briones, she dismisses her friend to spend a romantic afternoon with him. Briones criticizes Fran's mockery of her own career, though she rationalizes this by claiming that one should not be serious about a career that is going nowhere. Hereafter, she claims that Briones has left her and that she is planning on returning to the United States.\n\nSusie sets out to make Emilio believe that she is falling for him. When he proposes marriage, she hastily accepts and rushes into the proceedings—with the intention to scare him off—much to his surprise. Later that night, she confronts him about his playboy behavior, but Emilio claims that he has fallen for her.\n\nAt the office, Maggie discusses Pete's love for her and Paul expresses his dissatisfaction with current life. It leads to a romantic embrace. Pete walks in on them and storms off.\n\nPaul wakes up Maggie that night with a phone call, saying he needs Pete for an assignment. Maggie is upset that Paul assumes that Pete would be with her at night. She throws a tantrum, blaming him for thinking that she is \"easy.\"\n\nSusie comforts her by informing her about her engagement to Emilio. Then they find out that Fran has left the house. They worry about her, without realizing that she is spending her final days at the beach in Malagá happily with Briones. Fran offers to cancel her plane to stay with Briones in Malagá, helping him to save money for his clinic, though he has too much pride to ask her not to leave. Fran returns home to Madrid, telling her friends that Briones was too poor to support her.\n\nSusie is stood up by Emilio on an afternoon when she is scheduled to meet his mother (Isobel Elsom). She decides to visit by herself, and is shocked that Mrs. Lacayo has no idea who she is. The older woman apologizes for her son's behavior and explains that this is not the first time that Emilio misled a girl, leaving Susie heartbroken.\n\nBack at home, Maggie runs to a formal party with Paul, where she is confronted by Jane for being Paul's mistress. Maggie defends herself by claiming that Jane has lost her husband due to her lack of love for him, and when she furthermore expresses her pity, Jane slaps her and leaves. Maggie gets drunk and allows Pete to take her home. They are about to kiss when she passes out.\n\nThe following day, Maggie visits the office to inform Paul that she will return to New York with Fran and Susie. Paul accepts the situation and even arranges a meeting with Emilio to make him realize that he has made a mistake with Susie. On their final evening, the three women attend yet another party, where Paul announces his shift to New York. The women decide to stay and are all reunited with their men, though Maggie ends not with Paul, but with Pete, who will be Paul's successor in Madrid.\n\nThe film was announced in February 1964. The original stars to be in it were Ann Margret, Carol Lynley, James Darren and George Chakiris. By April Darren and Chakiris had dropped out, replaced by Gardner MacKay, with Pamela Tiffin as the third girl. Negulsesco said the film would be different from the earlier one. \"Instead of Rome, this picture is set in Madrid. Instead of three girls and three mean I'm using four. Naturally the problems of American girls living in Madrid are similar to those in \"Three Coins\" but this is 1964 so we'll have more difficulties.\"\n\nAnn Margret was paid $2,000 a week over ten weeks. This was less than she received for other studios but she had an old commitment to Fox.\n\nFiming started in May which stage Brian Keith had joined the cast.\n\nSeveral scenes were shot in the Prado Museum in Madrid.\n\nAccording to Fox records, the film needed to earn $3,900,000 in film rentals to break even and made $3,205,000, meaning it lost money.\n\n"}
{"id": "1923293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923293", "title": "Ernst vom Rath", "text": "Ernst vom Rath\n\nErnst Eduard vom Rath (3 June 1909 – 9 November 1938) was a German diplomat. He is remembered for his assassination in Paris in 1938 by a Polish Jewish teenager, Herschel Grynszpan, which provided a pretext for the \"Kristallnacht\", \"The Night of Broken Glass\".\n\nVom Rath was born in Frankfurt am Main to an aristocratic family, the son of a high-ranking public official, Gustav vom Rath. He attended a school in Breslau, and then studied law at Bonn, Munich and Königsberg, until 1932, when he joined the Nazi Party and became a career diplomat. In April 1933 he became a member of the SA, the party's paramilitary unit. In 1935, after a posting in Bucharest, he was posted to the German embassy in Paris. Regarding the \"Jewish Question\", Rath expressed regret that the German Jews had to suffer, but argued that the anti-Semitic laws were \"necessary\" to allow the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" to flourish.\n\nOn the morning of 7 November 1938, Polish-German Jew Herschel Grynszpan, 17, went to the German embassy in Paris and asked to speak with an embassy official. After he had learned of the deportation of his parents from Germany to the Polish frontier, Grynszpan assassinated Ernst vom Rath, the third secretary of the German embassy in Paris. He shot the 29-year-old vom Rath five times, mortally wounding him with bullets to the spleen, stomach and pancreas.\n\nAdolf Hitler himself sent his two best doctors, personal physician Karl Brandt and surgeon Georg Magnus, to Paris to try to save vom Rath's life. Hitler promoted vom Rath, who had been a junior officer at the embassy, to the rank of Legal Consul, First Class (\"Gesandtschaftsrat I. Klasse\") hours before vom Rath's death on 9 November at 17:30 (5:30 p.m.). \"Kristallnacht\" was launched within hours.\n\nWhy Grynszpan, who had fled from Germany to France in 1936, chose vom Rath is not known with certainty, although he was upset over news that his family was being deported from Germany back to Poland. As far as it can be established, Grynszpan and Rath did not know each other. Most accounts of the shooting state that Grynszpan did not ask for vom Rath by name but only asked to speak to a member of the diplomatic staff. The records were falsified in 1942, and the Germans spread propaganda that Grynszpan's intention was to kill the ambassador, Count Johannes von Welczeck.\n\nGrynszpan, who was immediately arrested and confessed, insisted his motives were to avenge the Jewish people for the actions already taken by the Germans. He had a postcard on him written to his parents that read, \"With God's help. My dear parents, I could not do otherwise, may God forgive me, the heart bleeds when I hear of your tragedy and that of the 12,000 Jews. I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do. Forgive me.\"\n\nVom Rath was given a state funeral on 17 November in Düsseldorf, with Hitler and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop among those in attendance. Germany used the incident to publicize that the Jews had \"fired the first shot\" in a war on Germany; in his funeral oration, Ribbentrop declared, \"We understand the challenge, and we accept it.\"\n\nAmerican journalist Dorothy Thompson reported widely on the case, and raised funds for Grynszpan's defence in his French trial, which never took place. Much to the fury of Grynszpan who wanted to use the defense that he killed Rath because he was a Jew, Grynszpan's French lawyer Vincent de Moro-Giafferi wanted to use as the defense the allegation that Rath was a homosexual who had seduced Grynszpan, and that Grynszpan had killed Rath as a part of a lover's quarrel. Grynszpan initially escaped from prison when France fell in 1940, but he was captured by the Nazis and taken back to Germany. He was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp to face a trial there, one that Joseph Goebbels planned to turn into Nazi propaganda about an international Jewish conspiracy and to claim it as evidence that Jews had started World War II.\n\nHowever, the allegations emerged that vom Rath was a homosexual, and Goebbels learned that Grynszpan was intending to use this claim in his defence at the trial by implying that vom Rath had seduced him. Grynszpan planned to claim that vom Rath was his pimp and he had been sent to be with various diplomats (although Grynszpan later stated this to be false in an encrypted letter sent from Sachsenhausen).\n\nThe homosexuality accusations threatened to humiliate the Nazis. Goebbels wrote that \"Grynszpan has invented the insolent argument that he had a homosexual relationship with... vom Rath. That is, of course, a shameless lie; however, it is thought out very cleverly and would, if brought out in the course of a public trial, certainly become the main argument of enemy propaganda.\"\n\nAccording to historian Hans-Jürgen Döscher, Germany's foremost authority on Kristallnacht, vom Rath was homosexual and had met Grynszpan in Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a popular haunt for gay men in 1938. The French writer André Gide, himself a homosexual, testified in his personal diaries that vom Rath was well known in the Parisian homosexual community. There were rumours that occasionally he was called \"Madame Ambassador\" and \"Notre Dame de Paris.\" His brother, Gustav, was convicted of homosexual offences and there were allegations that vom Rath was treated for rectal gonorrhoea at the Berlin Institute of Radiology.\n\nThe trial was planned for 1942 but never took place, primarily because the Nazis (who also sent homosexuals to concentration camps) feared it would turn into a gay scandal.\n\nGrynszpan's ultimate fate is unknown but he probably died in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The last documentation indicating he was alive, or thought to be alive, was a Foreign Ministry memorandum on 7 December 1942. In 1960, at the request of his parents in Israel, the lower district court in Hanover officially declared Grynszpan deceased, listing his date of death as 8 May 1945.\n\n\n"}

The constituent associations (also called \"clubs\") are responsible for providing roadside assistance, auto touring and leisure travel services, insurance services, and member discount programs within their territories. The CAA National Office in Ottawa coordinates relations between the clubs, oversees joint initiatives, and lobbies the federal government.\n\nThe CAA considers itself to be an advocate for Canada's motorists and travellers. CAA is an active political lobby for Canadian consumers, pursuing the interests of drivers and travellers in public consultations over urban planning and public transit.\n\nCAA Manitoba can trace its origins to the creation of the Winnipeg Auto Club in 1904, the first club of its kind in Canada. The organization later evolved into the Manitoba Motor League, becoming an integral part of motoring history in the province – from developing the first road map, to marking highways, to implementing road safety programs. The MML was renamed CAA Manitoba in 1993. Today CAA Manitoba represents more than 190,000 members and has expanded beyond emergency road service to include a full service travel agency, home and property insurance and travel products. CAA Manitoba is actively engaged in advocacy issues, most recently with its 'Move Over Manitoba' campaign to convince the provincial government to extend to tow truck operators the same protective measures that cover emergency roadside personnel.\n\nCAA Saskatchewan, formerly the Saskatchewan Motor Club, has been in operation since 1917 and includes automotive sales and service facilities, a travel agency and an insurance agency. Besides providing a full range of travel services and packages, CAA Saskatchewan also owns and operates its own motorcoach company, WestWorld Tours, which offers fully escorted tours to a variety of North American destinations. CAA Saskatchewan's insurance agency offers a wide range of insurance products, from basic coverage to all-risk comprehensive policies, for home and property, auto, health & dental, travel and life insurance, with added benefits and savings for CAA Saskatchewan Members. The Show Your Card & Save program also provides Members savings at thousands of attractions, retailers and merchants throughout the world, with point-of-sale discounts and the opportunity to earn CAA Dollars which can be redeemed on CAA merchandise and services.\n\nIn Ontario, the CAA was formerly the 'Ontario Motor League'.

By this time like-minded motorists were forming their own clubs throughout Ontario to exchange and share information about their vehicles. In 1907 the Toronto Automobile Club and clubs representing Hamilton, Ottawa and Kingston formed the Ontario Motor League (OML) with the purpose of helping automobile owners to lobby governments, as opposition to the automobile was extensive at the time. It had a paid membership from the various clubs of 170 active, and 56 associate, individual members.\n\nThe OML set up various committees such as the Legislative and Good Roads Committee and also started a Touring Bureau which informed members where they could drive without getting mired in mud, and which hotels would provide gas and water. New automobile clubs sprang up across Ontario, amalgamating in time with others, but still using the OML as a unifying organization to represent motorists to the government of Ontario. Over time, the names of both the individual clubs and the OML changed. By 1996, the old Toronto Automobile Club was known as CAA Central Ontario, and the OML as CAA Ontario which still exists as a formal organization to help represent the remaining clubs to the Government of Ontario.\n\nIn 2005, after mergers with CAA Eastern Ontario, CAA Peterborough, CAA Windsor, CAA Mid-western Ontario and the former CAA South Central Ontario (Hamilton and region), CAA Central Ontario took the name CAA South Central Ontario.

As of end 2009 the club had an active membership of 7,810, comprising approximately 70 different nationalities. Its clubhouse is located off Stevens Road, near the centre of town in Singapore. The club's facilities include four restaurants, five bars, several function rooms, a cinema/theatrette, two libraries, and extensive sports and recreation facilities including two swimming pools, a gymnasium, a four-table billiards room, four outdoor and two indoor tennis courts, six single and two jumbo double squash courts and a large roof-top lawn bowls green. The Club's sports sections offer external activities such as scuba diving and golf, and a new sports complex was completed in 2008.\n\nIts founding President was Singapore's first Police Commissioner, Thomas Dunman.\n\nThe Tanglin Club, one of Singapore's most prestigious and prominent social clubs, was founded in 1865 to cater to the social and recreational needs of locally based British officials and expatriates. That year, an interim committee was formed, and it comprised Thomas Dunman (President), Herbert Buchanan (Vice-President), Lancelot C. Masfen, Jos. M. Webster, William Mulholland, Walter Oldham, Edwin A. G. C. Cooke and John R. Forrester. Although race was not stipulated as a criterion for membership, only Europeans were admitted. Club members however, were mainly British. While the exact foundation date of The Tanglin Club is uncertain, it is suspected that the date which had been determined by The Tanglin Club Centenary Celebrations Committee in 1865 was the most convenient day to hold the celebrations. Two letters, which appeared in the Singapore Daily Times on 11 and 13 November 1865, allude to the formation of the club, and that in October 1865, legal documents show without doubt this club to be The Tanglin Club.\n\nOn 26 June 1866, a property was purchased in the District of Claymore from Arthur Hughes de Wind for 600 dollars. In December 1866, the trustees of the club borrowed 5,000 Spanish dollars to build a clubhouse with bowling alleys, billiards rooms and stables. \n\nThe Tanglin Club, one of Singapore's most prestigious and prominent social clubs, was founded in 1865 to cater to the social and recreational needs of locally based British officials and expatriates.

In December 1866, the trustees of the club borrowed 5,000 Spanish dollars to build a clubhouse with bowling alleys, billiards rooms and stables.\n\nIt is quite a mystery to why the club was named ‘Tanglin’, as there is no authority defining the origin or meaning of ‘Tanglin’. There exists, however, an \"asok\" or \"asoka\" tree related to the saraca tree which is recorded In Malay, although, the Malays generally refer to this native species as \"gapis\", \"talan\", \"tengalan\" or \"tanglin\". Sacred among the Hindus and particularly sacred to the Buddhists as being the tree under which the Buddha was born, this beautiful flowering tree with golden-orange flowers and deep purple pods up to twelve inches long is not common in present-day Singapore.\n\nAnother derivative for Tanglin may be a corruption of the Chinese words \"tang ling\" – \"tang\" meaning ‘eastern side’, and \"ling\" ‘a small hill’. In the 1860s, there were plenty of hills in the districts of Tanglin and Claymore – Nassim Hill, Mount Elizabeth, Cairnhill, Claymore Hill and Goodwood Hill.\n\nWhile it may never be known how the name ‘Tanglin’ originated, but as there are many places in Malaysia named after trees, it is possible that the club was named after the tree of the same name – perhaps one was growing on the very spot where the clubhouse stood.\n\nAbout two years after its founding, the club's management committee was unable to repay the first instalment of 2,000 Spanish dollars, which was due on 30 November 1868. The costs of construction of the clubhouse and the provision of amenities combined with the expenses involved in running the club must have placed a tremendous burden on its financial resources. The financial strain was made worse when the second instalment of the principal mortgage sum was due on 30 November 1871; the club was again unable to pay both that and the sum of 2,000 dollars.\n\nTen years after the loan of 5,000 dollars was drawn, the club could not afford to repay any of the principal sum borrowed. Even the staff's wages were left unpaid.\n\nAn extraordinary general meeting of the club was then called on 20 June 1876 to resolve the club's indebtedness. The meeting passed four resolutions, including appointing a committee to enquire and report to an adjournment of this meeting whether any person will advance 5,000 dollars on a mortgage of the club, and that a Member be appointed to purchase the property and re-mortgage the whole property to the new mortgage. No records of subsequent meetings are available but it is evident that the Tanglin Club literally went under the hammer.\n\nNevertheless, the club continued to function notwithstanding the charge and conveyance of its property, but likely only so because of the somewhat complex financial arrangement that had been devised to permit the continued use of the club and its facilities by its members. The saga of the original loan of 5,000 dollars continued until nearly the turn of the last century when the club's membership numbered around two hundred. In 1899, the club's indebtedness arising from this loan was finally totally discharged.\n\n\nBy the 1890s, the Claymore district had evolved into a prestigious district occupied by many prominent European residents. During the construction of the German Teutonia Club (present-day Goodwood Park Hotel), the Tanglin Club accommodated the Teutonia members. When the palatial Teutonia Club was completed in 1900, it quickly overshadowed the old and dismal looking the Tanglin Club. The Tanglin Club's German membership had dwindled from a strong number of 236 a decade ago to 181 in 1911. When World War I broke out in 1914, Teutonia Club was declared an enemy property.\n\nSeveral years after the end of the First World War in the early 1920s, the Tanglin Club purchased additional blocks of land. However, the good fortune of the Club was short-lived towards the end of the 1920s. The Great Depression had begun, and the finances of the club were severely strained.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, the Tanglin Club was used by the Japanese army as a club for their officers. The club was also used as a base for their propaganda unit as well as their storage area for rations and weapons. After the Japanese surrender, the Tanglin Club came under the management of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) until March 1946. It was not until 1 September 1946 that the club was informally reopened.\n\nThe men who gathered in the dining room of the Singapore Club on 21 May 1946 faced a daunting task – to reinstate the Tanglin Club, an institution founded seventy-five years earlier as a premier establishment – like the ‘forty good men and true’ who had met in 1865. The dedication of the post-war committee paid off; despite the difficulties faced, the club reopened informally on 1 September 1946, with 182 Ordinary Members, including 127 pre-war registered members, 23 lady members and provision for up to 300 service members.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the club consolidated its finances and continued to build up its membership. By September 1950, the membership stood at 1,309 – including 13 life and honorary members – and the waiting list was temporarily closed for the first time after the war.\n\nThe last significant event in the years leading to the centenary of the Tanglin Club in 1965 concerned the opening of membership. Although the rules of the club did not specifically deny membership on the grounds of race, but in practice, the club was British. In 1959, the elected government decided to eliminate the advantage enjoyed by citizens of the United Kingdom and British colonies in their eligibility for Singapore citizenship. An amended citizenship bill passed in May 1960 disallowed dual nationality and made the period of residence to qualify for Singapore citizenship eight years for all applicants, including British subjects.\n\nIn 1962, the government appealed to clubs in Singapore to have at least 50% Singaporean membership. After an extraordinary general meeting, the club's membership rule was amended to admit all races. The first Singaporeans to join the club included Shaw Vee Meng, Dr Yeo Chee Peng, Tan Eng Han, Koh Eng Yam, U. S. Chan and C. K. Sng.\n\nIn 1971, the completion of the pull out of the British forces stationed in Singapore signalled the end of a tradition in membership and association extended by the Tanglin Club from its founding. At a special meeting of Members on 3 May 1973, the category of Service membership was deleted from the club rules. By October 1978, the membership stood at 2,561 with 498 on the waiting list.\n\nTraditionally, women paid lower membership fees but were not given voting rights. It was only in April 1995 that women who were full members were accorded equal voting privileges in the club. Due to the club's constitution that capped Singaporean membership to 51%, the waiting time for Singaporeans has been known to be as long as 25 years.\n\n\nThe construction of a new four-storey clubhouse was carried out in phases since September 1977 and was completed in March 1981. On 14 March 1981, members bade farewell to the original clubhouse at a closing ceremony. Before the old clubhouse was demolished, memorabilia from the old building were auctioned off in support of the Children's Charity Association of Singapore. More than a month later, on 25 April 1998, the present clubhouse was officially opened by the then Minister for Law Edmund W. Barker. Over the years, the clubhouse had been upgraded to cater to members' needs. In 2005, the club embarked on a $21 million upgrading plan that included the construction of a new sports complex. The upgrading project is scheduled for completion in October 2007. In 2006, the club membership was 5,800, and it comprised 70 nationalities.\n\nDuring the 125th Anniversary celebrations of 1990, the then general committee carried out the interment of a time capsule. Containing various items of historical interest for future historians, the time capsule has rested undisturbed and shall not be opened till the 200th anniversary of the club in October 2065.\n\nTo commemorate the Big 150, events and promotions in celebration of this momentous milestone were featured throughout the year.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, Children's Day, the club hosted a poolside carnival for approximately 150 disadvantaged children. To make this event more special, Members kindly volunteered to lend a helping hand during the carnival. On the same day, the club held a specially commissioned 150th celebratory musical, \"‘The Tanglin Tree’\", composed by John Sharpley, with lyrics by Tanglin Club member Robert Yeo. Over forty artists joined hands to create this unique Tanglin production. In honour of the club's official colour, a Club-wide celebration \"‘Hallow’green’\" on 31 October 2015 was thrown.\n\nTo commemorate the 150th anniversary, the then general committee members gathered for the planting of a Tanglin tree at the poolside area on 14 December 2015.\n\nThe biggest milestone of the 150th Anniversary was the Charity Drive which raised a total of nearly $450,000, from members who generously contributed to this initiative. During the club's Charity Black Tie Gala Dinner in November 2015, a cheque of $195,975 was presented to Singapore President Tony Tan for the President's Challenge. By December 2015, the final donation to the President's Challenge amounted to $220,625. $73,550 was donated to Food from the Heart; $73,550 was donated to the Kidney Dialysis Foundation; a donation of $73,525 was channelled to Focus on the Family Singapore. Aside from the Charity Drive, $5,762 was donated to the club's adopted charity for 2015, Dover Park Hospice.\n\nTo thank the Tanglin Club members for their generosity during this Charity Drive, Singapore President Tony Tan presented a token of appreciation to Club President Robert Wiener during the Appreciation Night ‘Stories of Hope’ at the Istana on 27 January 2016. Club Vice-President Eugene Lim was also pleased to represent members to attend this joyous event.\n\nCurrently, the Tanglin Club stands proud as one of Singapore's oldest and prominent social clubs. Exclusively available to its members, the club is an inviting oasis for relaxation and rejuvenation as its ambience still evokes the grace and charm of the past while reflecting its mission of being a \"home away from home\". Even more so today, the Tanglin Club with its strategic location, cosmopolitan membership and modern facilities, caters to the wants and desires of contemporary men and women.\n\n"}

Located at Peabody Square in the Dorchester neighborhood, serves the MBTA's Red Line rapid transit line, the Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line, and the MBTA Bus system. It is the southern terminus of the Red Line's Dorchester Branch (Ashmont Branch), and the northern terminus of the Ashmont–Mattapan Line. Ashmont station is fully accessible for all modes.\n\nThe first Ashmont station was a simple building along the original Shawmut Branch of the Old Colony Railroad, which opened in 1872. That was when steam locomotives powered the passenger trains that continued into Boston with a stop at Fields Corner. The current intermediate Shawmut station was not created as a train stop until the Shawmut Branch of the steam railroad (by then under the New Haven Railroad) was adapted to electrified subway service in the late 1920s and placed underground as it approached Ashmont.\n\nWhen first built in 1928, no buses served the station; all lines ran streetcars. Specifically, the following Boston Elevated Railway streetcar lines operated to Ashmont (using post-1942 numbers), unloading on the east side and loading on the two west tracks on the west side:\nEastern Massachusetts Street Railway cars to Brockton also used the station.\n\nTwo streetcar lines serving the area west of Ashmont were bustituted soon after opening, later becoming the and buses. They were rerouted to Ashmont for faster access to downtown. A new busway was built on the west side of the station in 1929; this has since been connected to the old streetcar ramps. The first section of the Mattapan High Speed Line (originally ) also opened in 1929, serving the easternmost track on the west side.\n\nThe Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway line converted to bus in 1932, using the busway. The was bustituted in 1933, and a new route (, renumbered ca. 1967) serving the area east of the station was also added. Additionally the Eastern Mass started running buses over what are now the and routes.\n\nThe ramps were paved, and in 1949 the trolleybus replaced the and lines.\n\nThe station was modernized in 1976. The station was made nominally accessible, though the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act created stricter standards. In 1981, the platforms were extended for six-car trains, which were introduced in 1988.\n\nThe MBTA issued a $4.3 million design contract for renovations of Ashmont, Shawmut, and Fields Corner stations on May 3, 2001; the Ashmont portion was $1.3 million. The agency issued a request for proposals for transit-oriented development on an adjacent MBTA-owned parcel on January 22, 2002, and began negotiations with a developer that June. The developer signed an 85-year lease and paid $1.4 million up front to the MBTA. The Ashmont station renovation was originally to be smaller in scope than the major projects planned at the other Ashmont Branch stations. The developer and the local community expressed their desires for a larger renovation, but the MBTA proceeded with design work. \n\nOn January 10, 2003, with design work at 90% and $2.2 million spent, the MBTA stopped work. A $3.3 million design for a full reconstruction was authorized on February 12, 2004. The Shawmut and Fields Corner projects were constructed separate from the delayed Ashmont work. The MBTA removed the membrane canopy from the design in September 2004 due to lack of funds. However, it was necessary to re-add (at a cost of $2.9 million) because many of the interior elements were not weatherproofed.\n\nIn September 2004, the MBTA began reconstruction of the 75-year-old station, then expected to cost $44 million. The MBTA awarded the $35.2 million main construction contract on June 9 2005. The reconstruction included demolition of the existing station, the addition of two fare lobbies over the ends of the station, and a new busway at the fare lobby level. Elevators were added to make station fully accessible, and direct access from Peabody Square (removed in the 1970s renovation) was added. The Ashmont-Mattapan Line loop was moved to a new viaduct at the south end of the station, with a platform near the south fare lobby; the former cross-platform transfer was eliminated.\n\nRed Line service to Ashmont was maintained through the whole construction process. However, the Ashmont-Mattapan Line was closed from June 24, 2006 to December 22, 2007 for construction of the new viaduct. During that time, Mattapan station and the intermediate stations were also renovated for accessibility. The main reconstruction contract was completed in 2009 at a cost of $53.2 million - an increase of $18 million over the original price due to change orders. The $10.3 million architectural work lasted until June 14, 2011, at which point the station was declared accessible. In September 2011, a \"HOLD\" sign was installed on the trolley platform to allow an easier connection for those transferring from the Red Line. The total cost of the entire reconstruction was $83 million.\n\nAshmont is a major terminal for the MBTA Bus system, with seven local routes serving the station busway:\n\nThe Brockton Area Transit Authority operates its route 12 to Ashmont - one of the only non-MBTA routes running to an MBTA rapid transit station.\n\n"}

He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1961 and his master's degree in Hebrew literature in 1964. He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., in 1971. (Later he remarked that he chose Georgetown in part because it was a Catholic university.) He received rabbinical ordination in 1966 from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he studied under Abraham Joshua Heschel.\n\nHe married Melva Ziman in 1963. They have two children and five grandchildren.\n\nNovak was a pulpit rabbi in several US communities from 1966 to 1989. He also served as a Jewish chaplain at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, National Institute of Mental Health, Washington, D.C., from 1966 to 1969.\n\nIn 1989 he moved to the University of Virginia as Edgar M. Bronfman Professor of Modern Judaic Studies, a position he held until 1997. Since 1997 he has held the J. Richard and Dorothy Shiff Chair of Jewish Studies as Professor of the Study of Religion and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto. He is also a member of the Joint Centre for Bioethics. From 1997 to 2002 he also directed the Jewish Studies Programme.\n\nIn 1992–93 he was a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, D.C. He also lectured at Oxford University, Lancaster University and Drew University, and was a visiting scholar at Princeton University in 2004 and 2006.\n\nNovak has contributed to Jewish ethics by advocating a Jewish social ethics drawn from both the natural law tradition and Halakha. To this end, he interprets the rabbinic approach to Noahide laws as a useful grounding for cross-cultural moral reasoning. His expertise includes Maimonides, John Courtney Murray, and Paul Tillich. In his theology, he combines Jewish rabbinical tradition and logic with Christian teachings.\n\nHis specific normative claims in Jewish ethics include a mix of liberal and right-wing positions. An ordained rabbi, Novak had been affiliated with the Conservative movement in Judaism and then shifted to the Union for Traditional Judaism.\n\nNovak, together with Peter Ochs, Tikva Frymer-Kensky, and Michael Signer, drafted a full-page advertisement which appeared in the Sunday, 10 September 2000 edition of \"The New York Times\" under the title \"\"Dabru Emet\" (Speak Truth): A Jewish statement on Christians and Christianity\". Among the eight theological statements which the advertisement briefly laid out were: \"Nazism is not a Christian phenomenon\"; \"Humanly irreconcilable differences between Jews and Christians will not be settled until God redeems the entire world as promised in Scripture\"; and the statement which generated the most controversy in Jewish circles, \"Jews and Christians worship the same God\". The advertisement was signed by 160 rabbis, including many leading Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative thinkers and a handful of Orthodox rabbis known for their interfaith work. Explaining his rationale for publishing the document, Novak told \"Jweekly\": \"I want Jewish readers to clearly realize that Christians are not necessarily our enemies. Quite the contrary, they can be very good friends to Jews and Judaism\". The document was subsequently translated into eight languages.\n\nWhile some modern Jews are offended by the traditional Christian belief in supersessionism, Rabbi and Jewish theologian David Novak has stated that \"Christian supersessionism need not denigrate Judaism. Christian supersessionism can still affirm that God has not annulled his everlasting covenant with the Jewish people, neither past nor present nor future.\"\n\nNovak suggests that there are three options:\n\n\nHe observes, \"In the early Church, it seems, the new covenant presented by the Apostolic Writings (better known as \"diatheke ekaine\" or \"novum testamentum\") was either taken to be an addition to the old covenant (the religion of the Torah and Jewish Pharisaic tradition), or it was taken to be a replacement for the old covenant.\"\n\nNovak considers both understandings to be supersessionist. He designates the first as \"soft supersessionism\" and the second as \"hard supersessionism.\" The former \"does not assert that God terminated the covenant of Exodus-Sinai with the Jewish people. Rather, it asserts that Jesus came to fulfill the promise of the old covenant, first for those Jews \"already\" initiated into the covenant, who \"then\" accepted his messiahhood as that covenant's fulfillment. \"And,\" it asserts that Jesus came to both initiate and fulfill the promise of the covenant for those Gentiles whose sole connection to the covenant is through him. Hence, in this kind of supersessionism, those Jews who do not accept Jesus' messiahhood are still part of the covenant in the sense of 'what God has put together let no man put asunder' [emphasis original].\" See also Dual-covenant theology.\n\nHard supersessionism, on the other hand, asserts that \"[t]he old covenant is dead. The Jews by their sins, most prominently their sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah, have forfeited any covenantal status.\" The hard supersessionists base their views on the bible passages found in and . This classification provides mutually exclusive options. Hard supersessionism implies both punitive and economic supersessionism; soft supersessionism does not fall into any of the three classes recognized as supersessionist by Christian theologians; instead it is associated with Jewish Christianity.\n\nHe is a founder, vice-president, and coordinator of the Jewish Law Panel of the Union for Traditional Judaism, and a faculty member and vice-president of the Union for Traditional Judaism in Teaneck, New Jersey. He is a faculty member of the Department of Talmud and Halakha at the Canadian Yeshiva & Rabbinical School, Toronto. He also serves as a Visitor of Ralston College.\n\nIn the mid-1980s he was invited to join the Institute on Religion and Public Life by its founder, Richard John Neuhaus, and became a member of the editorial board of the institute's journal, \"First Things\".

{"id": "1923352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923352", "title": "National Airlines Flight 2511", "text": "National Airlines Flight 2511\n\nNational Airlines Flight 2511 was a United States domestic passenger flight from New York City to Miami, Florida. On January 6, 1960, the Douglas DC-6 serving the flight exploded in midair. The National Airlines aircraft was carrying 5 crew members and 29 passengers, all of whom perished. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation concluded that the plane was brought down by a bomb made of dynamite. No criminal charges were ever filed, nor was the blame for the bombing ever determined, though a suicide bombing is suspected. The investigation remains open today.\n\nOne of the victims was retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell, a Medal of Honor recipient and veteran of both World Wars.\n\nNational Airlines' New York-Miami route was usually flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601. On January 5, 1960, the 707 aircraft scheduled to fly to Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered in the cockpit windshield. The windshield replacement procedure would take eight hours to perform, so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve.\n\nPassengers were boarded on these two replacement planes on a first-come, first-served basis. 76 passengers boarded a Lockheed L-188 Electra. This aircraft flew to Miami and arrived safely.\n\nThe remaining 29 passengers boarded a Douglas DC-6B, which departed Idlewild Airport for Miami as Flight 2511. They were accompanied by two stewardesses, pilot Dale Southard, copilot Richard L. Hentzel, and flight engineer Robert R. Halleckson. The plane departed New York at 11:52 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Miami at 4:36 a.m. on January 6.\n\nThe aircraft, registration was described as being in good condition. It had four Pratt and Whitney R-2800 CB-16 engines and had accumulated 24,836 hours of flight time.\n\n2511's flight plan called for it to fly south from New York to Wilmington, North Carolina, where it would continue south over the Atlantic Ocean. It would fly south over the ocean to Palm Beach, Florida. The crew maintained radio contact with National Airlines' radio controllers and air traffic control, reporting clouds and instrument flying conditions. The crew checked in with Wilmington Airport at 2:07 a.m., and later reported flying over the Carolina Beach radio beacon at 2:31 a.m. This was the last radio contact with the airplane.\n\nAfter losing contact with the DC-6 aircraft, National Airlines, the United States Coast Guard, and the United States Navy began an intensive search along the southeastern coast of the United States. The search was called off the following day, when National Airlines received word that there was a plane down in North Carolina.\n\nAt about 2:45 a.m. a farmer, Richard Randolph, heard the sound of an engine cutting in and out, followed by tearing metal and an explosion. Later that morning, after his teenage son McArthur Randolph found airplane wreckage in one of father's fields, Richard Randolph drove to Bolivia, North Carolina, which had the nearest phone. He called Wilmington Airport to report the downed plane at approximately 7:00 a.m. When Highway Patrol officers responded, he led them to the crash site.\n\nBodies and wreckage were scattered over an area of covering farm fields, marshland, and pine forests.\n\nDuring the first day of search and rescue, investigators were able to locate 32 bodies of the 34 persons on board. One of the missing bodies was later found at the main crash site. The remaining body was found at Snow's Marsh, approximately from the main site.\n\nInitial reports speculated that the aircraft had disintegrated in mid-flight. One newspaper reporter indicated that the largest piece of wreckage he observed was a portion of the wing. A fragment of aluminum, believed to be a piece of the airplane's skin, was found on Kure Beach, from the rest of the wreckage.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), part of the Department of Transportation, were the primary investigators into the crash of Flight 2511. The wreckage of the DC-6 was taken to a hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar.\n\nInvestigators were able to identify the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of the leading edge of the aircraft's right wing. The material recovered from Kure Beach, including a portion of the wing fillet, was from this general area. Investigators were unable to recover material from an irregular, triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead of the wing.\n\nThe bodies were taken to the local high school gymnasium to await autopsy and identification by a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprinting team. The Brunswick County coroner ordered autopsies of the passengers and crew to determine the specific cause of death for each. One of the victims was Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell, U.S. Navy (retired), a recipient of the Medal of Honor and a veteran of both World Wars. Other victims included a vice president of the Continental Bank of Cuba, a pharmacist, a student at the University of Miami, and an insurance adjuster. Three of the victims had been standby passengers and only made the flight due to others cancelling their reservations.\n\nThe only body not found at the main crash site was that of Julian Frank, a New York City lawyer. His body was recovered from Snow's Marsh, located on the west side of the Cape Fear River. Frank's body had sustained significant injuries, including the amputation of both legs, and debris was embedded in his body. Frank's injuries were significantly different from and much more extensive than the other passengers'. Furthermore, Frank's injuries were inconsistent with the type of injury usually incurred in an aircraft accident.\n\nFrank was autopsied twice, the second time to recover debris embedded in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; the fingers of his right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.\n\nAt the time of the crash, Frank had been accused of running a charity scam and was under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office. It was alleged that he had misappropriated up to a million dollars in a series of scams.\n\nThe crash of National Airlines Flight 2511 came shortly after the crash of another National Airlines plane. National Airlines Flight 967 exploded over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959. The cause of the explosion was believed to be a bomb in the luggage of one of the passengers, Dr. Robert Spears, who enlisted a substitute to board the plane in his place. Spears was heavily insured, and the FBI indicated that his motive was insurance fraud. Similarly, Julian Frank was covered by almost $900,000 in life insurance policies, including some purchased the day of the crash.\n\nThe CAB sent the material recovered from Frank's body to the FBI laboratories for testing and analysis. Analysis determined that the many wire fragments that were found embedded in Frank's body, in the seats on the right-hand side, and in the carpeting, were low-carbon steel wire, in diameter. One of the dismembered fingers recovered from the wreckage had embedded in it the face plate of a travel alarm clock. A life jacket from Kure Beach, found with parts of a flight bag embedded in it, tested positive for nitrate residue. A black \"crusty\" residue on Frank's right hand was found to be manganese dioxide, a substance found in dry cell batteries.\n\nIn addition to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located on the right side of the aircraft near the leading edge of the wing. These samples contained sodium carbonate, sodium nitrate, and mixtures of sodium-sulfur compounds.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected in the area around the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.\n\nThe CAB's chief investigator, Oscar Bakke, testified before the Senate Aviation subcommittee to this effect on January 12, 1960. The same day, the FBI formally took over the criminal aspects of the investigation.\n\nOne of the first theories considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 was involved in a collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport. Investigators reviewed the flight plan and other documents to determine if other aircraft were in the area. There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations, namely the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6.\n\nAnother theory presented by an expert shortly after the crash theorized that an engine fire could have been the catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression.\n\nAlternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as the fact that some of the passengers were found wearing life jackets.\n\nThough the bombing and engine fire theories were the most commonly held, other theories were advanced during the investigation as well. Several days after the explosion, National Airlines pilots who were members of the Airline Pilots Association sent a telegram to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In the telegram, they made the claim that the routine proficiency flights performed by pilots caused unnecessary stress on the aircraft. These test flights, which pilots underwent every six months, required the pilots to put their aircraft through \"violent maneuvers\" which could damage the aircraft.\n\nIn their final report, the Civil Aeronautics Board indicated that it had investigated a variety of alternative theories, including:\nThe CAB was, however, able to rule out each of these theories during the course of their investigation.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that Flight 2511 was brought down by a dynamite explosion in the passenger cabin. The explosive charge was located \"beneath the extreme right seat of seat row No. 7.\" The report also pointed out that Julian Frank was close to the explosion, though it assigned no blame to him.\n\nThe explosion occurred at approximately 2:33 a.m., significantly damaging the structural integrity of the aircraft and forcing it into a wide, right-hand turn. As it descended, it suffered an in-flight disintegration and crashed at 2:38 a.m.\n\nThe CAB concluded in their final report:\nNo reference is made in this report concerning the placing of the dynamite aboard the aircraft or of the person or persons responsible for its detonation. The malicious destruction of an aircraft is a Federal crime. After the Board's determination that such was involved, the criminal aspects of this accident were referred to the Department of Justice through its Federal Bureau of Investigation ...The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the detonation of dynamite within the passenger cabin. — Civil Aeronautics Board File No. 1-0002, pp. 1,12\n\nThe FBI assumed control of the criminal investigation on January 20, 1960. The case remains open and unsolved.\n\n\n\n"}

The declared goal of CASs is to \"promote the best interests, protection and well being of children\".\n\nTheir principal goals are to:\n\nThe societies receive funding from, and are under the supervision of the Ontario Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. However, they are regarded as a Non-governmental organization (NGO), which allows CASs a large degree of autonomy from interference or direction in the day-to-day running of the Societies by the Ministry. There are 49 children's aid societies across Ontario, including 11 Indigenous societies. An oversight body known as The Child and Family Services Review Board exists to investigate complaints against a CAS and maintains authority to issue orders against the Societies.\n\nChildren's Aid Societies have authority under provincial legislation to remove children from homes where they face either a risk of harm, or have experienced harm. Children who cannot remain with caregivers are sometimes placed with other family members (\"kin\"), family friends (\"kith\"), or in customary care, which is an option for aboriginal children. In other cases, children can be placed into foster homes or group homes, as well as being adopted.\n\nOver the 12-month period from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, Ontario's Children's Aid Societies provided child welfare services to communities across Ontario. There were 77,089 allegations of child abuse and neglect investigated in Ontario. 27,816 Children were in the care of Children's Aid Society for protection from abuse and neglect. Of the children who were cared for by a society during the year, 9,468 came into care upon completion of abuse investigations. Of these, 6,565 children had not previously been in care and 2,903 children were returned to care due to new child protection concerns. Less than 1% of Ontario's 3 million children were in the care of Children's Aid Societies in the year 2007.\n\nConversely, during the 12 months between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario reviewed 91 cases including 18 Medical and 73 CAS cases that had received service during that time or up to 12 months previously. The causes of death were determined to be: • Medical: Natural, 17; Accident, 0; Homicide, 0; Suicide, 1; Undetermined, 0. • CAS: Natural, 10; Accident, 23; Homicide, 10; Suicide, 8; Undetermined, 15; Still under investigation, 7.\n\nOn their website, a Children's Aid Society makes the claim that most of the children who they visit remain in their homes; The number of children coming into care each year has continued to decline, in line with the general downward trend in Ontario's child population. In 2007/08 9,468 children came into care, a 26% decline compared to 2003/04. The rate of admissions into care was 3 children per 1000 of Ontario's children population. Ontario's leading academic study on child abuse and neglect states that exposure to intimate partner violence represents the largest proportion of substantiated maltreatment investigations. Almost half (48 percent) of all substantiated investigations identified exposure to intimate partner violence as the primary form of maltreatment (an estimated 20,443 investigations or 8.70 investigations per 1,000 children).\n\nChildren's Aid Societies also provide assessments, crisis intervention, counseling and services to prevent child abuse and neglect. In addition, Children's Aid Societies help vulnerable families protect and support their children. Many prevention programs are offered in partnership with other community agencies. Child protection workers also work to support families in crisis where their children are not in need of protection. A child protection worker remains involved with the family to ensure the appropriate supports and community services are in place. In 2007/08, 24,955 families received ongoing support from Children's Aid Societies where a child was in need of protection.\n\nOntario Association of Children's Aid Societies (OACAS) is a membership organization representing CASs in Ontario, Canada. Influencing government decisions, funding, and public opinion by promoting child welfare issues is a critical goal.\n\nEvery year the Office of the Coroner publishes a report on all children who died aged 5 and under all children who died while being served by a Children's Aid Society including children who were served up to 12 months prior to their deaths. These reviews are completed by the Pediatric Death Review Committee (PDRC)\n\n2009 Deaths Occurring and Reported by a Children's Aid Society:\n\nTotal Cases 120 Executive Review Only in 2009 74 Pending DU5C 2010/2011 10 Internal & PDRC Review 2010/2011 36\n\nAs per the Joint Directive for the reporting and reviewing of all child deaths known to a children's aid society within 12 months of the death, 120 child deaths were reported to the PDRC in 2009. In each case the CAS that provided service to the family submitted a serious occurrence report and within 14 days of the death submitted a Child Fatality Case Summary Report to the PDRC. The Executive Committee of the PDRC screens these reports and, within 7 days, a decision is made whether the CAS will be required to complete an Internal Review for the purposes of a future PDRC review. The decision to request an Internal Review is based on the criteria set out in the Joint Directive.\n\nThe Executive Committee of the PDRC reviewed all 120 deaths and requested Society Internal Reviews be submitted in 36 of them. A decision on 10 other cases is pending the anticipated review by the Deaths Under 5 Committee where cause and manner of death will be determined. It was determined that 74 of the 120 cases would not necessitate further review given the nature of the child's death and/or the Society's involvement. The majority of these cases were medically fragile infants or children who died as a result of natural causes, most of whom were in hospital born prematurely or with complex medical and/or genetic conditions. Most deaths are not reviewed in the year of death due to these timelines, the volume of cases, and the length of time required to complete a coroner's investigation, including various tests and reports. Additionally, cases before the criminal courts are generally not reviewed until any outstanding charges are resolved.\n\nExplanations: Executive Review Only: Are cases which, when reviewed by the Executive Committee of the PDRC (Chair and Coordinators), it is determined that no further review by the CAS or PDRC is required, as the death could not reasonably have been prevented or predicted by a CAS or medical intervention. For example, cases where the child's family had no CAS involvement until shortly before the death, or the child was known to CAS, but the death was natural and not unexpected, or the child died as the result of an incident unrelated to the family's involvement with CAS (i.e. child died in a car accident and the case was open to assist the parents in managing the behaviour of a different child).\n\nPending DU5C: On occasion, the decision to request an Internal Child Death Review is postponed pending the results of the coroner's investigation and/or review by the Deaths Under 5 Committee.\n\nInternal & PDRC Review: If the PDRC requests an Internal Child Death Review, agencies are given 90 days in which to submit their report, and the PDRC has up to 12 months to review the case and issue a report that may contain further recommendations. Expectations for such reviews are explained on this page.\n\nCAS Status of Children Who Died in 2009 • 19 (16%) of the 120 reported child deaths in 2009 were in the care of a CAS; eight of those were crown wards. Additionally, two youths were living on Extended Care and Maintenance (ECM). • 101 (84%) of the deaths involved children living with families who had received CAS services in the previous 12 months. • 43 of the 120 deaths of children were considered to be medically fragile meaning their deaths were not sudden or unexpected; this included 12 of the 19 children in care.\n\nIn its Child Welfare Report, 2009–10, the Ontario Association of Children's Aid Societies reports the following: • Ontario CASs provided substitute care to more than 27,000 children in 2008-09 •There were 17,876 children in care of a CAS on March 31, 2009 • 9,200 of those children and youth in care are permanent wards • Over 28% of the 2,112 Aboriginal children in care of four of six designated agencies are in customary care arrangements. • Ontario has the second lowest rate of children in care in Canada at 6.4 per 1,000 •The most common reasons children and youth are admitted to care are: 1. neglect 2. emotional harm 3. physical harm 4. sexual harm 5. domestic violence 6. problematic behaviour of the child • Children in care account for approximately 1 in 10 cases serviced by a CAS • In 90% of families receiving services from a CAS, children remain at home \n\nChildren's Aid Societies have been found guilty of incompetence, negligence and malicious prosecution. In 2010 a Psychologist employed by Durham CAS was found guilty for misrepresenting his qualifications.\n\nHundreds of children under supervision of CAS have died in the last few years but CAS will not release much information citing privacy concerns.\n\nIn the province of Ontario, the majority of front-line CAS workers are not registered social workers. Several groups, including Canadacourtwatch.org posting Case Law and Canada Court Watch.com's public protest efforts have brought these issues to light, citing concerns with respect to accountability.\n\n\"Powerful As God\", a 2011 film focusing on the first hand experiences of 26 individuals who witnessed the social devastation caused by Ontario CAS in recent years. This documentary reveals a hidden world of corruption, power hunger and incompetence that has been hidden from the scrutiny of the public eye for many decades. This award-winning film was produced and published by the Documentary Media (MFA) Program, Ryerson University and can be viewed online.\n\nIn March 2013, The \"Toronto Star\" published an article about a leaked memo which would suggest that the CAS are funded on open cases and on a per-child basis. In this memo, Peel workers were urged to delay the closing of files for as long as possible sparking controversy with parents with open files and children in care. Families who are separated by court orders who should return were met with high resistance by the CAS. This is also the potential proof that the funding model that CAS is currently receiving is being corrupted to achieve maximum funding by the government.\n\n"}
{"id": "1923364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923364", "title": "Edgar (opera)", "text": "Edgar (opera)\n\nEdgar is an operatic \"dramma lirico\" in three acts (originally four acts) by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Ferdinando Fontana, freely based on the play in verse \"La Coupe et les lèvres\" by Alfred de Musset. \n\nThe first performance was given at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 21 April 1889. The opera was not a success. Puccini repeatedly revised it, before eventually giving up in frustration, declaring the work irredeemable. \n\n\"Edgar\", Puccini's second opera, was composed on a commission from the publisher Ricordi after the successful reception of his first stage work, \"Le Villi\". The plot indicates the influence of Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\". Both centre on medieval knights struggling between a life of sensual indulgence and ideal love. Edgar is \"torn between the sacred love of Fidelia and the profane love of Tigrana\"; Wagner's hero indulges himself with Venus while pining for the love of Elizabeth. The gypsy-like figure of Tigrana (supposedly the child of \"wandering Moors\") also parallels the anti-heroine of Bizet's \"Carmen\".\n\nThe original version had four acts and was tepidly received. In January 1890, Ricordi published a revised version, including a different ending for act 2. In the autumn of 1891, Puccini revised the work again, cutting the last act and producing a three-act version which would again be revised in 1905.\n\nIn this final form the opera had even less success than in its original four-act structure. Some of the music that was cut in 1891 was reused in \"Tosca\" and became the beautiful act 3 duet, \"Amaro sol per te m'era il morire!\". The funeral march from act 3 was played at Puccini's funeral, conducted by Arturo Toscanini and the aria \"Addio, mio dolce amor\" (Farewell, my sweet love) from act 4 was sung.\n\nPuccini finally gave up on \"Edgar\" and in later years, bitterly repudiated the work.

(And may God protect you from this opera!)\nThe autograph of the acts 1 and 3 of the original version is preserved in the Archivio Ricordi in Milan. The autograph of the acts 2 and 4, which was believed lost till 2008, was owned until her death by Simonetta Puccini, the composer's granddaughter.\n\nThe first version was performed at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 25 June 2008, directed by Yoram David.\nAmerican musicologist Dr. Linda Fairtile\nis working on producing the critical edition of the first version, but the score performed in Turin is based on Puccini's autograph. Fairtile worked on it together with Gabriele Dotto and Claudio Toscani.\n\nIn the opera's 1905 version, it was first given in the US on 12 April 1966 and in the UK on 6 April 1967 (by Hammersmith Municipal Opera under Joseph Vandernoot).

Fidelia gives an awakening Edgar a sprig of almond blossoms, but leaves when she sees Tigrana approaching. Tigrana tries to tempt Edgar to return to their life of debauchery, but fails when Edgar avows he loves Fidelia's purity. Frank, who has always loved Tigrana, enters, but when he cannot win her affections, he berates her, and they argue.\n\nAfter Tigrana mocks the villagers at prayer, they order her to leave the village. She retreats to Edgar's house, where he defends her from the angry crowd. He announces that he will go with her, and burns down his house before leaving. Frank attempts to stop them, and is wounded in a duel with Edgar. The villagers curse the fleeing lovers.\n\nEdgar has left the wild orgy in Tigrana's house. He is tired of his life of debauchery and longs to return to Fidelia. Tigrana comes to him to entice him back to the party, but, just as she is about to succeed, a platoon of soldiers arrives. Edgar is surprised that Frank is leading them, and asks for forgiveness. Frank grants it happily because the fight actually had broken the hold Tigrana had on him. To escape from Tigrana, Edgar joins the platoon, despite her pleading. Tigrana swears revenge as the men leave her.\n\nA large funeral procession carries the armored body of Edgar, who has fallen in battle. Frank and the crowd praise Edgar as a hero, but the monk who heard Edgar's dying confession denounces him. He reveals Edgar's sins and debauchery, and the crowd, easily swayed, curses Edgar. Only Fidelia stands up for Edgar and vows that she will meet him in heaven.\n\nAfter the crowd leaves, Tigrana enters, crying. She is upset that no one will see her weeping for Edgar. Frank and the monk ask her to denounce Edgar, but she resists until they offer her jewels. The crowd returns. The monk claims that Edgar betrayed his country for some gold, and Tigrana reluctantly confirms this. The soldiers try to desecrate the body and discover it is only a suit of armor. The monk reveals that he is Edgar and goes to leave with Fidelia, the only one who remained true to him. The vengeful Tigrana stabs and kills Fidelia. Edgar weeps over the lifeless body as the soldiers capture Tigrana, and the crowd prays.\n\n\"Act 1\"\n\"Act 2\"\n\"Act 3\"\n\"Act 4\"\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

In 1910, when the Empire of Korea was annexed by Japan and Emperor Sunjong was forced to abdicate, Yi Un was titled \"His Highness The Crown Prince of Korea\". On 10 June 1926, upon the death of Emperor Sunjong, he became \"His Highness Great Prince Yi of the Ch'angdŏk Palace\" in Japan. After World War II he was refused entry to Korea, and his Japanese titles were removed by article 14 of the new Constitution of Japan in 1947.\n\nIn 1920, he married Princess Masako of Nashimoto (born 4 November 1901 – ), the eldest daughter of Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, on 28 April 1920 at Tokyo. \n\nThe prince was born on 20 October 1897 at Deoksu Palace in Seoul as the seventh son of Gojong, the Gwangmu Emperor. His mother was the Honorable Princess Consort Eom Seon-yeong, a palace attendant, who was posthumously awarded the title of Princess Sunheon. He was also the younger half-brother of Emperor Sunjong and Prince Imperial Ui. He was titled \"Prince Imperial Yeong\" in 1900, and became the crown prince in 1907, despite being younger than Prince Ui. Prince Ui's support base at court was not strong because his own mother, Lady Jang, had already died.\n\nIn December 1907, he was taken to Japan on the initiative of Itō Hirobumi to be enrolled at Gakushūin Peers' School. The move was meant to ensure that the Korean royal family would not take any further anti-Japanese actions following The Hague Secret Emissary Affair. Japanese Emperor Meiji, who largely ignored his own grandchildren, devoted a lot of attention to Yi Un, acting as his guardian.. Itō would bring Yi Un whenever he was visiting the princes Hirohito, Chichibu and Takamatsu. Meiji apparently stopped seeing Yi Un so frequently after Ito's assassination. Yi Un was allowed to visit Korea again only after the death of his mother in 1911.\n\nIn September 1911, the prince was enrolled in the second year of the Army Central Youth School, a military preparation school located in Tokyo. He was poor in gymnastics due to his small statue, but excelled in music and martial arts. He was then enrolled in the 29th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, from which he graduated on 25 May 1917 with an excellent record.\n\nHe was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry on 25 December, and steadily rose up the ranks, receiving promotions to lieutenant (April 1920), and captain (July 1923). He graduated from the 35th class of the Army Staff College in November 1923 and commanded a battalion of the Guards 2nd Infantry Regiment. He was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office in December 1924, and to the staff of the Chosen Army in July 1926. In May 1927, he was sent on an extensive European tour, visiting France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Monaco, and returning to Japan in April 1928. In August, he was promoted to major and in August 1929 became commander of the IJA 1st Infantry Regiment. In December 1930, he was assigned to the Inspectorate General of Military Training and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1932. He became colonel in August 1935 and commanded the Utsunomiya-based IJA 59th Infantry Regiment. From April 1937, he served as an instructor at the Army Academy.\n\nIn July 1938, the prince was promoted to major general and from December was assigned to the staff of the North China Area Army, which was engaged in combat operations in northern China following the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Throughout the first half of 1939, he made extensive inspection tours of front-line units throughout northern Japan, and reviewed Kwantung Army garrison units in Manchukuo. In August, he was appointed commander of the Guards 2nd Brigade and in May 1940 was commander of the reserve Fourth Depot Division. He was promoted to lieutenant general in December. In July 1941, he was appointed commander of the IJA 51st Division. \n\nUnder his command, the division relocated to Manchukuo to participate in the Special exercise of the Kwantung Army (actually a mobilization for the possible large-scale conflict with the Soviet Union). The preparations for the war with the Soviet Union were officially cancelled in August 1941. In September, the division was transferred to Guangdong under command of IJA 23rd Army. He returned to a post on the staff of the Inspectorate General of Military Training in November.\n\nFrom August 1942, the prince was transferred to the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and became commander of the 1st Air Army from July 1943. In April 1945, he became a member of the Supreme War Council \n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, Yi Un lost his royal status under the American Occupation of Japan in 1947. He was also declared stateless, as Korea had become independent of the Empire of Japan, but Korean President Syngman Rhee had refused his request to be allowed to return to Korea with his family. In May 1957, following the end of the American occupation, he acquired Japanese citizenship and travelled to America the same month. In March 1959, while still in America, he suffered from a stroke. He returned to Japan in May. In 1960, President Rhee again denied him permission to return to Korea, but instead offered the prince the position of Korean Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He refused on the grounds of illness, but made a trip to New York from June to August 1960, and to Hawaii from March to May 1961. His health deteriorating rapidly, he was hospitalized in Tokyo from August 1961.\n\nIn November 1963, President Park Chung-hee granted permission for Prince Yi Eun and Crown Princess Bangja to return to Korea. By that time, Prince Yi Eun was unconscious from cerebral thrombosis. He received treatment at St. Mary's Hospital in Seoul.\n\nIn his final years, Prince Yi Eun lived at Nakseon Hall, Changdeokgung Palace, the former residence of the Korean Imperial Family in Seoul, with Bangja and his younger sister Princess Deokhye. Seven years after returning to his country, he died on 1 May 1970 at Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace, Seoul. He was buried at Hongreung in Namyangju, near Seoul; he is known posthumously as Yi Un, Crown Prince Euimin of Korea.\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to her career in music, she worked as graphic designer. In the early 1980s she started singing in The Watermelon String Band, a bluegrass band led by Bruno Guaitamacchi that played in Milan pubs. \n\nStucchi was discovered at age 20 by the Italo producer Roberto Gasparini, who decided to give her the name Valerie Dore to improve her international appeal. Dore's first single, \"The Night\" (1984) produced and arranged by Lino Nicolosi, was an Italo disco ballad written by Giuseppe Nicolosi and Barbara Lynn Addoms. The production team, however, was unsure of Stucchi's vocal abilities, and decided to use Dora Carofiglio (singer of the band Novecento) instead. Slight variations on this professional arrangement continued for the next two singles, \"Get Closer\" and \"It's So Easy\", released in 1984 and 1985, respectively. During this time, the Italian music news publication \"TV Sorrisi e Canzoni\" (\"Smiles and Songs\") awarded Dore the prize of best new artist of year. She also finished second at the \"Festivalbar\" music showcase and performed on the TV show \"Azzurro\" and on German TV.\n\nIn 1986, Dore and her collaborators parted ways due to personal and artistic differences. Dore began working with new production team at Castello di Carimate on her second album, \"The Legend\". Marco Tansini provided the music, Simona Zanini provided lyrics and background vocals and Stucchi recorded lead vocals.\n\n\"The Legend\" album's first single, \"Lancelot,\" was a hit in Italy. The second single, \"King Arthur,\" enjoyed moderate success in Europe, and was performed on the Italian music program \"Discoring\". The songs \"The Magic Rain\" and \"Bow and Arrow\" were radio hits as well.\n\nIn 1986, Dore was voted the 6th best female artist in Italy by readers of \"TV Sorrisi e Canzoni\". The following year, she moved to London to record the single \"Wrong Direction\" in collaboration with her future husband, Mauro Zavagli, for their new disco label \"MZM PRODUCTION\" (MauroZavagliMonica Production). She worked in a studio with German producer Ralph Ruppert and collaborated with musicians Nick Beggs from Kajagoogoo and Marck Price. The underpromoted record hit #23 in the Italian charts.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1991, Dore and her husband were in Madagascar where they began a casual collaboration with a local group, an aspiration that Dore long had. She considered recording a new LP in a Caribbean style, but after some contact with international labels companies, she came to believe that such a record would be too different from her previous work and the rest of Italian dance music and dropped the project.\n\nIn 1992, the ZYX label released Dore's \"The Best of Valerie Dore\" with bonus tracks: the extended versions of her dance hits \"The Night\", \"Get Closer\" and \"It's So Easy,\" plus two remixes of \"The Night\" done by DJ Oliver Momm. In 1995, Zavagli and Dore moved to Arezzo, Toscana, where Dore took a break from music to start working as a restorer. At the same time, they opened a gallery store in Milan.\n\nIn November 2006, Dore recorded a new song \"How do I get to Mars?\" and launched her personal web site www.valeriedore.it (Italian). In 2007, she promoted non-smoking, on \"Radio 24\". She had been smoking for 15 years, and it was affecting her voice and shortening her career. She wanted to inspire others to stop smoking as well, and, through radio and in an internet forum, she encouraged abstinence. In 2007 she recorded more material in her home studio, eventually released in the 2014 album \"Greatest Hits & Remixes\". \nShe is preparing new publications.\n\n\n\nOfficial site www.valeriedore.it\n\n"}

It is North Carolina's largest single-site tourist attraction, attracting 17.6 million visitors in 2005. The mall is located about a mile from Charlotte Motor Speedway.\n\nLike many of the Mills Corporation's other shopping malls, Concord Mills is composed mainly of outlet stores, big box stores, and entertainment venues. Anchor stores include AMC Theatres, Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy (Former Circuit City), Books-A-Million, Burlington Coat Factory, Dave & Buster's (former Jillian's), Forever 21 (former FYE), Camille La Vie (former Group USA), H&M (former Off 5th Saks Fifth Avenue), Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse, Sea Life Charlotte-Concord Aquarium (Former NASCAR Speedpark), Sun & Ski Sports, The Children's Place, and VF Outlet.\n\nOther stores include Nike Factory Store, The LEGO Store, American Eagle Outfitters, Finish Line, Inc., Old Navy Outlet, Express, F.Y.E., T.J.

Bruton Smith Boulevard, the main road that runs near the mall, is lined with dozens of restaurants, stores, hotels, and car dealerships, with many new establishments opening each year. Other major attractions around the mall include the Great Wolf Lodge of Concord, which also attracts many out-of-town tourists. The Charlotte Motor Speedway and zMax Dragway are about a mile away. The mall is notoriously known for bad traffic, especially on weekends, Black Friday, and the holiday season.

The town of Shajapur is the district headquarters.\n\nShajapur District is part of the Malwa Plateau. The district is situated in the northwestern part of the state and lies between latitudes 32\"06' and 24\" 19' North and longitudes 75\" 41' and 77\" 02' East. The district is bounded by Ujjain District to the west, Dewas and Sehore to the south, Rajgarh to the east, and Jhalawar District of Rajasthan to the north. Shajapur district is part of Ujjain Division.Shajapur district in Ujjain division was brought during 1981 census. The district is identified from the Headquarters town Shajapur named after honor of Shahjahan the Mughal Emperor who halted here in 1640. It is said that the original name was Shahjahanpur, which subsequently reduces to Shajapur. Since the formation of the Gwalior state, it has remained a district.\n\nThe district was formerly a district of Gwalior State. When Gwalior acceded to the Government of India after Indian Independence in 1947, Shajapur District, along with the rest of Gwalior State, became part of Madhya Bharat. Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 1956.\n\nThe entire district is a part of the Deccan Traps flood basalts of the Cretaceous-Paleocene. Alluvium of the recent period is, however, found along the river Parbati in a narrow strip. The district has deep black and shallow black brown and alluvial soils of the northern region. Shajapur is a part of central Madhya Pradesh plateau and Ratlam plateau. The physical geography of the district can be sub-divided into the following:\n\nThis is the western part of the district covering the major areas of Agar malwa tehsil. There is a hill tract in the west of Badod town showing scattered hillocks in a north-south direction. The presence of hills in the center has affected the drainage pattern. The height of this tract varies between 500 and 545 meters above the mean sea level and it slopes towards the north. Dudhaliy and Kachhol are the main streams in the west, originating from the hill tract and draining towards the west. Chhoti Kali Sindh, which is the main perennial stream of the region, flows northwards on the western border of the region.\n\nThe region stretches from north to south in the middle of the district covering considerable portions of Agar Malwa and Shajapur tehsils and a small part of Susner tehsil. It is a part of the Malwa plateau with typical topography. There is a continuous chain of hills throughout the entire region. The height of the region varies between 450 and 530 meters above the mean sea level. The surface height decreases towards the north. Since it is an upland area, a number of seasonal streams originate from this zone and drain mostly towards the east. Lakundar and Ahu are the main streams flowing from south to north in this region. The streams that join the Lakundar river on its left bank, originate from this hill tract. The Ahu river drains along the western border of the region. The hilly terrain is covered with forest.\n\nThe Kali Sindh basin stretches between the southern and northern limits of the district. It occupies the major parts of Susner and Shajapur tehsils and a very small part of Agar tehsil. The southern part of the region is hilly whereas the northern part is plain. The hills gradually decrease in height from south to north. There are a few scattered hillocks in the central and northern parts also. The altitude of the region varies between 450 and 528 meters above the mean sea level. Numerous streams originate from the hilly area and dissect the surface. Kali Sindh is the main river, which traverses through the hills and further flows on the eastern border of the district. Lakundar is the main rivulets of Kali Sindh that flows northwards. Geologically the entire region is a part of the Deccan Trap of the Cretaceous Eocene period.\nIts main helping river is kanthal that is the major source of water in Soyat Kalan.\n\nThis region extends over the eastern part of the district covering the entire Shujalpur tehsil and a small segment of Shajapur tehsil. Being a part of the Malwa plateau, it presents a dissected topography. A hill range enters this region from the north and extends towards the south. The southern part of the region is an upland area and northern part is relatively low lying. In the south, the hills are scattered and are eroded by various streams. The height at the region varies between 435 and 507 meters above the main sea level. The 450 meters contour encircles the area along the Newaj river where the small hills are spread, and the Newaj dissects these hills. The eastern part of the region is a low and water dividing line of the western part can be decided by the tributaries of Newaj. The river Newaj and Parbati drains the region. The river Parbati flows northwards on the eastern border of the region while river Newaj flows in the middle of the region. Both the rivers are perennial.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Shajapur District has a population of 1,512,681, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii. This gives it a ranking of 330th in India (out of a total of 640). \nThe district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 17.17%. Shajapur has a sex ratio of 939 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 70.17%.\n\nAt the time of the 2011 Census of India, 99.90% of the population in the district spoke Hindi as their first language.\n\n"}

Marked \"astragali\" (talus bones) of sheep and goats are common at Mediterranean and Near Eastern archaeological sites, particularly at funeral and religious locations. For example, marked astragali have been found near the altar of Aphrodite Ourania in Athens, Greece, suggesting astragalomancy was performed near the altar after about 500 BC.\n\nAlso known as cleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice or bones stretches back before recorded history. The Metropolitan Museum of Art displayed bone \"dice\" (\"hakata\") used by the Shona people of southern Africa.\nThey have been in use for thousands of years, and remain extant.\n\nSince astragalomancy is a form of sortition, numbers are scrawled into the dice; the numbers are associated with letters, thus bearing on the questions of the diviner. The diviner then casts the dice, resulting in a random sequence of numbers. The diviner interprets this sequence according to certain rules – usually rules specific to his/her religion (e.g. Buddhism).\n\nAstragalomancy is considered the twin of pessomancy (also known as psephomancy) – another act of divination which uses colored or marked pebbles as opposed to numbered dice. These pebbles are either thrown out of a bag after shuffling or drawn from the bag at random. The interpretation of the colors or symbols relate to issues such as health, communications, success, and travel.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is reported as using the \"mo\", balls of dough in which have been placed pieces of paper with possible \"choices\" written on them, to help in making important decisions. Tibetan divination has long featured the \"mo\" in making everyday decisions, too. There are books written by various lamas on interpretations for the casting of dice.\n\n"}

An ait is characteristically long and narrow, and may become a permanent island should it become secured and protected by growing vegetation.

It has a crest, heavy hooked bill, and brilliant red eyes. The adult male has black upperparts, with two white wingbars and white underparts. There is a white dorsal patch normally concealed except in threat display; young males are similar to the adult, but have rufous wing coverts. The female has rich rufous upperparts and white underparts.\n\nThis is a bird of thickets, cocoa and citrus plantations and sometimes gardens, with a preference for dense undergrowth. It is usually found as territorial pairs. \n\nThe female lays two, sometimes three, grey-marked white eggs in a deep cup nest in a shrub, which are incubated by both sexes for 14 days to hatching. The chicks fledge in another 12 days.\n\nThe great antshrike feeds on insects and other arthropods gleaned from foliage. It will also take small lizards and mammals. It is a skulking species, which may be located by its song, 30 to 40 musical \"pook-pook-pook\" notes, or a snarled \"churrrr\". Sleeping birds are readily located at sites such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre on Trinidad.\n\n\n"}

He is remembered for his patronage of the arts and Dravidian architecture, along with refurbishment and decoration of many Kovils in the Tamil continent. He oversaw a massive economic growth of the Pandyan kingdom. On the eve of his death in 1268 CE, the second Pandyan empire's power and territorial extent had risen to its zenith.\n\nSundara Pandyan I acceded to the Pandyan throne in the year 1251 CE. During the middle part of the 13th century, Pandya kingdom was ruled by many princes of the royal line. This practice of shared rule with one prince asserting primacy was common in the Pandyan Kingdom. The other princes of the Pandyan royal family with whom Sundara Pandyan I shared his rule were Maravarman Vikkiraman II and his brother Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I.\n\nBy the middle of the 13th century, the Chola dynasty which had dominated Southern India over the past three centuries was declining. The last king of the Later Cholas, Rajendra Chola III reigned over a crumbling empire beset with rebellion and increasing external influence from Hoysalas and Kadavas. Previous rulers of the Pandyan kingdom like Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I had succeeded in overthrowing Chola hegemony. Jatavarman annexed Kongu nadu and subdued Lingaya Gounder and made him his vassal. The Hoysala dominance over the Tamil Kingdoms had also waned by the time Sundara Pandyan I took power in 1251. He covered Entire Tamil Nadu which extended up to Nellore of present day Andhra Pradesh.\n\nSundara Pandyan I first invaded the Chera country ruled by Viraravi Udaya Marthandavarman. The Chera army was defeated and their king killed in battle. Next he turned his attention to Cholas. Rajendra Chola III was defeated and accept Pandyan suzerainty.\n\nHe invaded Hoysala dominions along the river kaveri and captured the fortress of Kannanur Koppam. Several Hoysala generals including Singana were killed and great amount of loot was captured along with many horses, elephants and women. This invasion was stopped after Someshwara withdrew into his kingdom. A later attempt by Someshwara to invade Pandyan kingdom in 1262 ended in his defeat and death. Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I became the governor of the captured territories.\n\nSundara Pandyan besieged the city fortress of Sendamangalam and fought with the Kadava king Kopperunchingan II. However he restored Kopperunchingan to his throne and gave him his country back. He also conquered Magadai and Kongu countries during his campaigns against Kadavas and Hoysalas\n\nResponding to an appeal for help from a minister in Sri Lanka, Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan intervened in 1258 and made Chandrabhanu of Tambralinga, a Savakan usurper of the Jaffna kingdom submit to Pandyan rule and annually offer precious jewels and elephants in tribute. A second attempt by Chandrabhanu to invade the south of the island from the north prompted the Prince Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I, brother and lieutenant of Sundara Pandyan I to intervene again in 1262-1264 on Sundara Pandyan I's behalf. Chandrabhanu was killed in this conquest and the other king of the island was subjugated. Veera Pandyan I proceeded to plant the Pandyan bull victory flag at Koneswaram temple, Konamalai. Chandrabhanu's son Savakanmaindan was installed and submitted to Pandyan rule on the northern Tamil throne before he too was defeated upon Sundara Pandyan I's son Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I's, invasion in the late 1270s. Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I had succeeded his father as Lord Emperor of Pandyan following the latter's demise in 1268 and invaded to punish the Jaffna monarch for stopping the annual tributes he owed Pandyan. The minister in charge of his invasion, Kulasekara Cinkaiariyan, an Aryachakravarthi, was installed as the new king of the island's north. The Aryacakravarti dynasty line of Jaffna rule thus began.\n\nAfter subduing the Kadava Kopperunchingan II, Sundara Pandyan led an expedition to the North. Pandyan forces killed the Telugu ruler Vijaya Gandagopala and captured Kanchipuram in 1258. This bought them in conflict with the Kakatiyas under Ganapati II. Sundara Pandiyan I defeated a Telugu army at Mudugur in the current Nellore district and performed a \"virabisheka\" to commemorate the end of his campaign. However Ganapathi II later defeated Kopperunchingan II who was by then a Pandyan ally and recaptured territories up to Kanchipuram. The Kadava Pallava Kopperinjungan II was followed by very weak successors and Sundara Pandyan annexed Kanchi, Nellore and Visayavadai (modern Vijayawada) regions to the Pandyan Kingdom.\n\nSundara Pandyan used the vast treasure he got out of his wars to beautify the Siva temple in Chidambaram and the Vishnu temple in Srirangam. For gold plating the roofs of these two temples he was given the title of \"\"pon veindha perumal\"\"().He also gave many grants to temples in Trichy, Thanjavur and Kanchipuram. He built a temple at Aragalur (Magadai Mandalam) for the merit of Kulasekara around 1259. He acknowledged the contributors of other dynasties to Tamil Nadu by building a gate at the Sri Ranganathaswami Temple at Srirangam in which he engraved the names of all the four great empires of Tamil Nadu namely the Cholas, Pallavas, Pandyas and the Cheras. He also built the East tower of the Madurai Meenakshi Temple. He gold plated and placed the gold gilded Kalasam atop the gopurum of the Ananda Nilayam vimana of Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. In 1263 CE, he renovated the gopuram of Koneswaram temple and his son Veera Pandyan implanted the Pandyan victory flag and insignia of a \"Double Fish\" emblem at Konamalai.\n\nHaving vanquished his neighbours Sundara Pandyan took the titles like \"\"Emmandalamum Kondaruliya Pandiya\"\", \"\"Tribhuvana Chakravarthy\"\", \"\"Ponveintha Perumal\"\", and \"\"Hemachadana Raja\"\". His Meikeerthi praises him as \"the conqueror of Kongu Nadu and Eelam; the conqueror of the Ganges and Kaveri; Vanquisher of Hoysala; Subjugator of Kadava Kopperunchingan I; The one who paid victory tribute and bravery tribute at Chidambaram; The ruler of three worlds\" ().\n\nSundara Pandyan I was succeeded by Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I in 1268 and died in 1271.\n\n"}

The station is served by the Northern service between Sheffield and Manchester, East Midlands Railway service from Liverpool to Norwich and the TransPennine Express service between Manchester and Cleethorpes, all three running via the Hope Valley Line.\n\nThe station was opened by the Midland Railway, for passengers only, as \"Dore and Totley\" on 1 February 1872 (at a building cost of £1517 and £450 for of land) on the then two-year-old Midland Main Line extension from Chesterfield to Sheffield, and was initially served by the local services on this line. The station was then served by six or seven weekday trains and three on Sundays.\n\nIn 1894 the station became the junction for the new Dore and Chinley line (now the Hope Valley Line). Dore & Totley Station Junction was at the south end of the station and the signal box stood in the angle between the Chesterfield and Chinley lines.\n\nBetween 1901 and 1902, the line between Sheffield station and Dore was widened; the original twin tracks continued to be used by traffic for the Dore and Chinley line and two new tracks were built to the east of this for traffic on the main line to Chesterfield. The original southbound platform was converted to an island platform and a new platform for trains to Chesterfield built to the east. The line from Chesterfield was slewed into its present course to serve the new platforms. A new Dore and Totley Station Junction was made to the north of the station.\n\nOn 9 October 1907, a Sheffield to Birmingham and Bristol express train ran foul of the points at the station. One of the locomotives hit the platform and overturned. The driver and the second man were thrown from the cab but survived, and the passenger coaches fortunately stayed upright with no passengers injured.\n\nDore and Totley became south Sheffield's only remaining station after the Beeching cuts in the 1960s saw Beauchief, Millhouses and Heeley stations all close. The station was closed to main line traffic and became an unstaffed halt in 1969. It was renamed \"Dore\" on 18 March 1971. Subsequently, the island and eastern platforms were demolished in the mid-1980s. Mainline services from the South therefore can no longer stop at the station and the Hope Valley Line now runs single-track (it was singled in March 1985) through the station, with trains in both directions stopping at the one remaining platform. The photograph (right) is taken from the north and shows the remaining platform on the Hope Valley line and none on the main line.\n\nThe single-track section through the station has become a significant bottleneck, as noted in Network Rail's Yorkshire and Humber Route Utilisation Strategy of 2009. The strategy included proposals to address the problem by re-doubling the track and building a second platform (subject to funding being obtained). South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive has also been lobbying for this problem to be addressed (as noted in its 2006 Rail Strategy document).\n\nThe station site had previously been occupied by the Walk Mill; a water-powered mill in operation from the 1280s onwards was used by the monks of Beauchief Abbey to cleanse and thicken cloth.\n\nThe name \"Dore and Totley\" was restored in April 2008 when the station received new Northern Rail branded running in boards. \nPlans to double the size of the station by 2014 have been delayed. An additional platform and new Disability Discrimination Act 1995-compliant footbridge are to be provided. Construction work began in December 2012 on a new 129-space car-park, which was completed in April 2013.\n\nNetwork Rail's Hope Valley Capacity Scheme includes plans to restore the second platform at Dore & Totley. Plans include a new bridge with passenger lifts and a shelter on the single sided island platform for Manchester bound trains. This plan is spun out of the original Manchester Hub scheme, now renamed the Northern Hub, incorporating two freight passing loops to be constructed east of Bamford and at Dore South. Once completed an hourly stopping service is hoped to be provided (as stated in the new 2016 Northern franchise agreement), and platforms should be long enough to accommodate 6 car trains, now running on TPE fast services.\n\nThe Secretary of State at the Department for Transport approved the Capacity Scheme in February 2018 and Network Rail have indicated an intended start date late in 2020. That might allow completion by 2022, but trains are not expected to be able to operate any major new services before December timetable changes, and possibly later.\n\nIn May 2019 a canopy was added to the old 1872 station building.\n\nThe station is unstaffed, but has a self-service ticket machine available. The old station buildings are now in private commercial use as a restaurant. A small brick waiting shelter is provided at the northern end of the platform, along with passenger information displays, automatic announcements and timetable poster boards to offer train running information. Step-free access is available from the adjacent car park to the platform.\n\nThe station has an hourly Northern Trains stopping service in each direction on the Hope Valley line (but with some gaps of two hours or more) between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly, augmented by a number of peak-hour stops (designed primarily for Manchester bound commuters) by faster trains on the South Trans-Pennine and Liverpool–Norwich routes. During the rest of the day those hourly TransPennine Express services and East Midlands Railway non-stopping trains pass through.\n\n"}

The market for these grew enormously and Weymann licensed his system to many of Europe's most prestigious marques.\n\nA change of fashion in the late 1920s led to a demand for gloss painted bodies and the fabric market disappeared.

It is an important breeding site for seabirds such as red-billed tropicbird, Audubon's shearwater, brown booby, brown noddy, sooty and bridled terns. A few pairs of white-tailed tropicbirds are also nesting here.\n\nLittle Tobago is also a good site from which to see birds which breed on neighbouring small islands, including red-footed booby and magnificent frigatebird. The latter species is frequently seen harassing the tropicbirds, boobies and terns.\n\nA few species of reptiles have been recorded on Little Tobago. Among them are lizards such as Green Iguanas, \"Ameiva atrigularis\", Rainbow whiptails, Antilles leaf-toed geckos, Turnip-tailed geckos, Ocellated geckos (\"Gonatodes ocellatus\"), Mole's geckos (\"Sphaerodactylus molei\"), Allen's bachias (\"Bachia heteropa alleni\"), and snakes including Boddaert's tropical racers (\"Mastigodryas boddaerti\") and Oliver's parrot snakes (\"Leptophis coeruleodorsus\").\n\nAmong the more conspicuous of the invertebrate fauna on the island are large terrestrial hermit crabs.\n\nThe sea between Tobago and Little Tobago is shallow, and glass-bottomed boats enable the attractive corals and brightly coloured tropical fish to be seen on the crossing. It is a popular area for snorkeling and diving, especially on Angel Reef in front of Goat Island.\n\nIn 1908 the British politician and businessman Sir William Ingram purchased Little Tobago in order to turn it into a bird sanctuary. The next year he introduced the greater bird of paradise (\"Paradisaea apoda\") to the island in an attempt to save the species from overhunting for the plume trade in its native New Guinea. The bird's plumage was particularly fashionable in women's hats. Forty-seven juvenile birds were duly introduced to the island, having been transported on a German ocean liner. Ingram duly hired a middle-aged Swiss sailor by the name of Roberts to manage the sanctuary. Roberts sent updates every few weeks, including sketches of the birds, and descriptive doggerel of them. Roberts, however, died not long thereafter when he fell into the sea whilst inebriatated, expiring a short time later in his island cabin.\n\nAfter Ingram's death in 1924 his heirs deeded the island to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago as a wildlife sanctuary. The birds survived on the island until at least 1958 when they were filmed by a \"National Geographic\" crew. There are no reliable records after 1963 when Hurricane Flora hit the island and the population is presumed to be extinct.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1923472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923472", "title": "Bhoja", "text": "Bhoja\n\nBhoja (reigned c. 1010–1055 CE) was an Indian king from the Paramara dynasty. His kingdom was centered around the Malwa region in central India, where his capital Dhara-nagara (modern Dhar) was located. Bhoja fought wars with nearly all his neighbours in attempts to extend his kingdom, with varying degrees of success. At its zenith, his kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east.\n\nBhoja is best known as a patron of arts, literature, and sciences. The establishment of the Bhoj Shala, a centre for Sanskrit studies, is attributed to him. He was a polymath, and several books covering a wide range of topics are attributed to him. He is also said to have constructed a large number of Shiva temples, although Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur (a city founded by him) is the only surviving temple that can be ascribed to him with certainty.\n\nBecause of his patronage to scholars, Bhoja became one of the most celebrated kings in the Indian history. After his death, he came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king. The body of legends clustered around him is comparable to that of the fabled Vikramaditya.\n\nBhoja's father and predecessor was Sindhuraja. According to \"Bhoja-Prabandha\", his mother's name was Savitri. Bhoja's reputation as a scholar-king suggests that he was well-educated as a child. The \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" states that he was educated by his guardians as well as other learned scholars.\n\nAccording to \"Bhoja-Prabandha\", early in his life, Bhoja suffered from intense headaches. Two Brahmin surgeons from Ujjain made him unconscious using an anaesthetic powder called \"moha-churna\", opened his cranial bone, removed a tumor, and then made him regain his consciousness by administering another powder called \"sanjivani\".\n\nAccording to \"Tilaka-Manjari\", composed by Bhoja's contemporary Dhanapala, Bhoja's feet had auspicious birthmarks indicating that he was fit to be a king. His uncle Munja (and his father's predecessor) loved him greatly, and appointed him as the king.\n\nHowever, several later legendary accounts state that Munja was initially jealous of Bhoja, and tried to prevent him from becoming a king. For example, the 14th century \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that during the reign of Munja, an astrologer prophesied Bhoja's long reign. Munja, who wanted his own son to become the king, ordered Bhoja's killing. Bhoja was appointed as the king by the royal ministers after Munja's death. According to a Gujarati legend documented in Rasmala, Munja ordered Bhoja's murder, but later appointed him as the crown prince.\n\n\"Bhoja-Prabandha\" states that Munja ordered one Vatsaraja to kill Bhoja at the Mahamaya temple in Bhuvaneshvari forest. On hearing Bhoja's cultured manner of talking, Vatsaraja and his men abandoned the murder plan. They faked Bhoja's death, and presented to Munja a fake head and a verse from Bhoja. The verse described how great kings like Mandhata, Rama and Yudhishthira died leaving behind all their property; it then sarcastically added that Munja would be the only one whom the earthly possessions would follow. The verse moved Munja to tears, and made him realize his mistake. When he learned that Bhoja was still alive, he invited Bhoja to back to his court. To repent for his sin, he also went on a pilgrimage to Dharmaranya, where he established a town called Munjapuram. The sarcastic verse, purportedly written by Bhoja to Munja, also appears as an antonymous extract in \"Sharngadhara-paddhati\" (1363 CE).\n\nThese stories of Bhoja's persecution by Munja are essentially mythical. This legend is not found in the works composed by the contemporaries of Munja, Sindhuraja and Bhoja. For example, the \"Nava-sahasanka-charita\" makes no mention of this story. The legend appears to be the poetic imagination of later composers. \"Ain-i-Akbari\" also contains a variation of this account, but completely distorts the legend, naming Munja as the one who was persecuted by Bhoja. This account is also completely unreliable from a historical point of view.\n\nSome literary works suggest that Bhoja succeeded his uncle Munja as the Paramara king. These works include \"Tilaka-Manjari\", \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", and \"Rasmala\". However, several other works as well as epigraphic evidence indicate that Bhoja succeeded his father Sindhuraja. Padmagupta, the court poet of Sindhuraja and Bhoja, also supports this fact. According to \"Bhoja-Prabandha\", Munja left the Paramara administration in hands of Sindhuraja before departing on a military expedition. Munja unexpectedly died in this campaign, and as a result, Sindhuraja succeeded him as the king. Sindhuraja's court poet Padmagupta, in his \"Nava-Sahasanka-Charita\", states that Munja \"placed the world in Sindhuraja's hands\" before leaving for Ambika's town. This indicates that he left the administration in Sindhuraja's hands before leaving for his fatal expedition against Tailapa II. \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription seems to confirm this.\n\nThe Modasa copper plates (1010–11 CE) are the earliest historical record of Bhoja's reign. The \"Chintamani-Sarnika\" (1055 CE) was composed by Bhoja's court poet Dasabala. An inscription of Bhoja's successor Jayasimha I is also dated 1055 CE. Thus, 1055 CE can be taken as the last year of Bhoja's reign. Based on these evidences, scholars such as Pratipal Bhatia assign Bhoja's reign to 1010–1055 CE.\n\nHowever, some scholars assign the beginning of Bhoja's reign variously between 1000 CE and 1010 CE, based on their interpretations of inscriptions and legendary texts. For example, Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that Bhoja ruled for 55 years, 7 months and 3 days. Based on this, scholars such as D. C. Ganguly and K. C. Jain assign Bhoja's reign to 1000–1055 CE. However, as K. M. Munshi states, dates are \"the weakest point in Merutunga's narratives\". A. K. Warder, who dismisses Merutunga as \"completely unreliable\" and his narratives as \"essentially fiction\", believes there is no evidence that Bhoja's reign began much earlier than 1010 CE.\n\nIn the Paramara inscriptions, Bhoja is mentioned as \"Bhoja-deva\". In some modern north Indian languages such as Hindi, he is also known as \"Bhoj\" (because of schwa deletion). Bhoja's inscriptions mention his titles as \"Parama-bhattaraka\", \"Maharajadhiraja\" and \"Parameshvara\". \"Ganaratna Mahodadhi\" (1140 CE), a work on grammar by Vardhamana, suggests that \"Tribhuvan Narayana\" or \"Triloka Narayana\" (\"Lord of the three worlds\") was also a title of Bhoja. This is corroborated by epigraphic evidence: the Shiva temple ascribed to Bhoja in the Chittor fort has an idol which was named \"Bhojasvamindeva\" as well as \"Tribhuvan Narayanadeva\".\n\n<mapframe text=\"Inscriptions from Bhoja's reign have been found in present-day Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan states of India\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"6\" longitude=\"75.18\" latitude=\"22.60\">\n</mapframe>\n\nWhile Bhoja became famous as a benevolent king and a patron of arts and culture, he was also renowned as a warrior. He inherited a kingdom centered around the Malwa region, and made several attempts to expand it with varying results. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription of Bhoja's brother compares Bhoja to the legendary king Prithu, and states that he \"ruled the earth from Kailasha to Malaya hills and up to the mountains of the setting and the rising sun\". This is an obvious exaggeration: historical evidence indicates that Bhoja's kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east.\n\nSeveral legends mention conflicts between the ruler of Malwa and the Chaulukyas, during the reign of the Chaulukya kings Vallabha-raja and Durlabha-raja. Vallabha is said to have died of smallpox during an expedition against the Paramaras. This incident may have happened during the early part of Bhoja's reign, or during the reign of his father Sindhuraja. Vallabha's successor Durlabha is said to have repulsed an attack by a confederacy that included the ruler of Malwa, but modern historians doubt the authenticity of this legend.\n\nBhoja's first military aggression appears to be his invasion of the Lata region (in present-day Gujarat), around 1018 CE. Bhoja subjugated the Chalukyas of Lata, whose ruler Kirtiraja may have served as his feudatory for a brief period. Bhoja's invasion of Lata brought him close to the Shilahara kingdom of northern Konkana, which was located to the south of Lata. Bhoja invaded and captured Konkana sometime between 1018 and 1020 CE, during the reign of the Shilahara king Arikesari. He celebrated this victory in a big way by making generous donations to Brahmins. His 1020 CE inscription states that he organized a \"Konkana-Grahana Vijaya Parva\" (\"Konkan Victory Festival\"). The Shilaharas probably continued to administer Konkana as Bhoja's vassals. By the end of his reign, Bhoja had lost this territory to the Chalukyas of Kalyani.\n\nSometime before 1019 CE, Bhoja formed an alliance against the Chalukyas of Kalyani with Rajendra Chola and Gangeyadeva Kalachuri. At this time, Jayasimha II was the Chalukya king. The triple alliance engaged the Chalukyas at their northern and southern frontiers simultaneously. The extent of Bhoja's success in this campaign is not certain, as both Chalukya and Paramara panegyrics claimed victory. Historian D. C. Ganguly believes that Bhoja achieved some early victories against the Chalukyas, but was ultimately defeated. Others, including D. B. Diskalkar and H. C. Ray, believe that Bhoja was defeated by Jayasimha after some early successes, but ultimately emerged victorious against the Chalukyas after 1028 CE. According to Georg Bühler, the struggle probably ended with some advantage for Bhoja, which might have been exaggerated into a great victory by the Paramara poets.\n\nThe \"Udaipur Prashasti\" states that Bhoja defeated a ruler named Indraratha. Modern historians identify this king with Indranatha, the Somavamshi king of Kalinga. This king was defeated by Rajendra Chola: Bhoja may have played a secondary role in the Chola campaign as part of an alliance.\n\nThe Ghaznavids, a Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, invaded north-western India in the 11th century, led by Mahmud of Ghazni. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" claims that Bhoja's mercenaries defeated the Turushkas (Turkic people). There are some legendary accounts of Bhoja's military successes against the foreign invaders identified with the Ghaznavids. However, there is no clear evidence to show that Bhoja fought against the Ghaznavids or any other Muslim army. Bhoja might have contributed troops to the Kabul Shahi ruler Anandapala's fight against the Ghaznavids. He is believed to have granted asylum to Anandapala's son Trilochanapala. Several medieval Muslim historians state that Mahmud avoided a confrontation with a powerful Hindu ruler named Param Dev after sacking the Somnath Hindu temple. Modern historians identify Param Dev as Bhoja: the name may be a corruption of Paramara-Deva or of Bhoja's title \"Parameshvara-Paramabhattaraka\". Bhoja may have also been a part of the Hindu alliance that expelled Mahmud's governors from Hansi, Thanesar and other areas around 1043 CE.\n\nBhoja's attempt to expand his kingdom eastwards was foiled by the Chandela king Vidyadhara. However, Bhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandela feudatories, possibly after Vidyadhara's death. The Kachchhapaghatas of Dubkund, who were the northern neighbours of the Paramaras, were originally Chandela feudatories. However, their ruler Abhimanyu accepted Bhoja's suzerainty. \n\nAccording to the \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription, Bhoja defeated the Gurjara king. The identity of this king is debated by the historians, but he is generally identified as a weak Gurjara-Pratihara ruler of Kannauj. Bhoja did not retain control of Kannauj for a long time, if at all.\n\nThe 1046 CE Tilakawada copper plate inscription states that Bhoja's general Suraditya stabilized his royal fortune by slaughtering one Sahavahana in a battle. Some earlier historians identified Sahavahana as a king of Chamba, but this identification is doubtful, considering the distance between Chamba and Malwa, and the fact that the ruler of Chamba was not powerful enough to destabilize Bhoja's kingdom. Sahavahana might been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the Kalachuri king Karna.\n\nBhoja defeated and killed Viryarama, the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler. Encouraged by this success, he also waged a war against the Chahamanas of Naddula. But in this second campaign, his army was forced to retreat, and his general Sadha was killed.\n\nDuring the last years of Bhoja's reign, sometime after 1042 CE, Jayasimha's son and successor Someshvara I invaded Malwa, and sacked his capital Dhara. Multiple Chalukya inscriptions dated between 1058 and 1067 CE state that the Chalukyas plundered the important Paramara cities, including Dhara, Ujjayini and Mandapa. Bhoja re-established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army. Nevertheless, the defeat was a major setback for the Paramaras, and pushed back the southern boundary of their kingdom from Godavari to Narmada.\n\nAlthough the Bhoja and Kalachuri king Gangeya were part of an alliance against the Chalukyas, Bhoja defeated Gangeya. It is not certain when they turned into enemies. According to one theory, Bhoja defeated Gangeya before his Chalukya campaign, in which Gangeya must have fought as a Paramara vassal. A contradictory theory is that the two turned enemies after their Chalukya campaign, sometime between 1028 CE and 1042 CE. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" also claims that Bhoja defeated one Togglala, who might have been Gangeya's predecessor Kokalla II.\n\nDuring the last year of Bhoja's reign, or shortly after his death, the Chaulukya king Bhima I and the Kalachuri king Karna attacked his kingdom. According to the 14th century author Merutunga, Bhoja had once thought of subjugating Bhima, but Bhima's diplomat avoided a Paramara invasion by instigating Bhoja against the Chalukyas of Kalyani instead. Sometime before 1031 CE, Bhima launched an expedition against the Paramara branch at Abu, forcing its ruler Dhandhuka to seek shelter with Bhoja. Hemachandra, who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, states that Bhoja's general Kulachandra once sacked the Chaulukya capital while Bhima was fighting a war at the Sindh frontier. Bhima later dispatched his soldiers to raid Malwa several times. Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that once two such soldiers attacked Bhoja in the vicinity of his capital Dhara, but the Paramara king escaped unhurt.\n\nMerutunga also states that Karna once challenged Bhoja to either a war or a palace-building contest. Bhoja, who was an old man by this time, chose the second option. Bhoja lost this contest, but refused to accept Karna's suzerainty. As a result, Karna, in alliance with Bhima, invaded Malwa. According to Merutunga, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom. Several literary works written under Chaulukya patronage suggest that Bhima subjugated Bhoja while Bhoja was still alive. However, such claims are not corroborated by historical evidence.\n\nBhoja is best remembered for his intellect and patronage to cultural activities. Noted poets and writers of his time sought his sponsorship. The Kashmiri writer Bilhana famously rued that Bhoja died before him, because of which he failed to seek the king's patronage. Several later kings also emulated Bhoja. For example, Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire styled himself as \"Abhinava-Bhoja\" (\"the new Bhoja\") and \"Sakala-Kala-Bhoja\" (\"Bhoja of all the arts\").\n\nBhoja was himself a polymath. Under his rule, Mālwa and its capital Dhara became one of the chief intellectual centres of India. He is said to have paid great attention to the education of his people, so much so that even humble weavers in the kingdom are supposed to have composed metrical Sanskrit kavyas.\n\nBhoja is said to have founded the city of Bhojpur, a belief supported by historical evidence. Besides the Bhojeshwar Temple there, the construction of three now-breached dams in that area is attributed to him. The temple originally stood on the banks of a reservoir 18.5 long and 7.5 miles wide. This reservoir was formed through construction of 3 earth-and-stone dams during Bhoja's reign. The first dam, built on Betwa River, trapped the river waters in a depression surrounded by hills. A second dam was constructed in a gap between the hills, near present-day Mendua village. A third dam, located in present-day Bhopal, diverted more water from the smaller Kaliasot river into the Betwa dam reservoir. This man-made reservoir existed until 15th century, when Hoshang Shah emptied the lake by breaching two of the dams.\n\nBhoja established the Bhoj Shala which was a centre for Sanskrit studies and a temple of Sarasvatī in present-day Dhar. According to folklore, the Bhopal city was established by and named after him (\"Bhojpal\"), but it is possible that the city derives its name from another king called Bhupala (or Bhupal).\n\nBhoja was renowned as a scholar-king, and several books are attributed to him. Because these books cover an enormous range of topics, it is not certain if he actually wrote all these books or if he only commissioned these works, acting as a patron of their actual writers. But it is known that he was an expert on poetry, and the treatise \"Shringara-Prakasha\" was definitely authored by him.\n\nAccording to Ajada, who wrote a commentary titled \"Padaka-prakasha\" on \"Sarasvati-Kanthabharana\", Bhoja wrote 84 books. The surviving works attributed to Bhoja include the following Sanskrit-language texts (IAST titles in bracket):\n\nThe Prakrit language poems \"Kodanda-Kavya\" and \"Kurma-Sataka\" are also attributed to Bhoja. The \"Kodanda-Kavya\" (Kodaṅḍakāvya) was found inscribed on stone slab fragments at Mandu. The \"Kurma-Sataka\" (\"Avanikūrmaśataka\"), which praises the Kurma (tortoise) incarnation of Vishnu, was found inscribed at the Bhoj Shala in Dhar.\n\n\"Sangitaraja\", attributed to Kalasena or Kumbha, names Bhoja as an authority on music, which suggests that Bhoja also compiled or wrote a work on music.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that Bhoja was a devotee of Shiva. His writings qualify Shiva as \"Jagadguru\" (\"World teacher\"), and his inscriptions begin with verses praising Shiva. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription of the later Paramara rulers states that Bhoja \"covered the earth with temples\" dedicated to the various aspects of Shiva, including Kedareshvara, Rameshwara, Somanatha, Kala, and Rudra. The Jain writer Merutunga, in his \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", states that Bhoja constructed 104 temples in his capital city of Dhara alone. However, the Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur is the only surviving shrine that can be attributed to Bhoja with certainty. Several historians, including G. H. Ojha and R. Nath, have identified the Samadhishvara Shiva Temple in Chittor with the Tribhuvana Narayana Shiva or Bhoja-svamin temple attributed to Bhoja; the temple has been restored several times since its construction.\n\nThe Jain legends state that Bhoja converted to Jainism. According to this account, his court poet Dhanapala convinced the king to give up Vedic animal sacrifices. The poet also openly ridiculed Bhoja's other religious beliefs, including his worship of Kamadeva-Rati and cow. Gradually, Dhanapala convinced Bhoja to become a Jain.\n\nThese accounts of Bhoja's conversion to Jainism are irreconcilable with historical evidence. In a \"Bhoja-Prabandlha\" legend, a Brahmin named Govinda calls Bhoja a Vaishnavite. It is possible that Bhoja patronized other faiths despite being a Shaivite.\n\nBhoja married multiple women as part of matrimonial alliances with other ruling dynasties. His chief queen was Liladevi or Lilavati. His other queens included Padmavati (princess of Kuntala), Chandramukhi (princess of Anga) and Kamala.\n\nInscriptional evidence suggests that he was succeeded by Jayasimha, who was probably his son. Jayasimha's Mandhata grant of 1055 CE mentions his predecessors as Bhoja, Sindhuraja and Vakpati. However, this inscription does not specify the relationship between Bhoja and Jayasimha, and it is the only epigraph that mentions a Paramara king named Jayasimha. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" and \"Nagpur Prashasti\" inscriptions of the later Paramara kings give a detailed genealogy of the Paramara kings, but do not mention Jayasimha. These two inscriptions name Udayaditya as the next ruler after Bhoja. Udayaditya is now known to be Bhoja's brother.\n\nIn terms of the number of legends centered around him, Bhoja is comparable to the fabled Vikramaditya. Sheldon Pollock describes Bhoja as \"the most celebrated poet-king and philosopher-king of his time, and perhaps of any Indian time\". Bhoja came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king, who was the ultimate judge of literary qualities and generously rewarded good poets and writers. Most of these legends were written three to five centuries after his death.\n\nApart from epigraphic records, much of the information about Bhoja comes from these legendary accounts, including Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" (14th century), Rajavallabha's \"Bhoja-Charitra\" (15th century), and Ballala's \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" (17th century). However, many of the popular legends about Bhoja do not have any historical basis. For example, the \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" anachronistically describes the ancient poet Kalidasa as a contemporary of Bhoja.\n\nIn order to enhance their imperial claims, the Paramaras promoted several legends associating Bhoja with the ancient legendary kings. For example, in \"Simhasana Dvatrimsika\" (popularly known as \"Singhasan Battisi\"), Bhoja finds a throne of Vikramaditya, and each of the 32 divine figurines attached to the throne tell him a story about Vikramaditya. A \"Bhavishya Purana\" legend describes Bhoja as a descendant of Vikramaditya and Shalivahana. According to this legend, the mleccha (foreign) influence had corrupted Indian culture by the time of Bhoja's ascension. Bhoja marched up to the banks of the Indus river, and defeated several mleccha kings. The poet Kalidasa, who accompanied him, magically turned into ashes a mleccha named Mahamada, whose followers came to be known as Muslim (The character Mahamada is based on Muhammad possibly combined with Mahmud of Ghazni). After returning to his capital, Bhoja established Sanskrit language among the top three varnas and Prakrit language among the Shudras. During his 50-year reign, Aryavarta (the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas) became a blessed land where the varna system was established. On the other hand, caste mixture took place beyond the Vindhyas (that is, in South India). Again, this is an imaginary account not supported by any historical evidence.\n\n"}

It is the largest suburban school district in the state, and the fourth largest school district in New Jersey (after Newark, Jersey City and Paterson). It is also the largest school district in the state that is not an Abbott District.\n\nAs of the 2014-15 school year, the district and its 18 schools had an enrollment of 16,125 students and 1,177.2 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.7:1.\n\nThe district has three high schools -- Toms River High School South, Toms River High School North, and Toms River High School East—as well as three middle schools—Toms River Intermediate School East, Toms River Intermediate School North (formerly Intermediate West), and Toms River Intermediate School South. With the opening of Intermediate South in 2005, all sixth grade classes were shifted from the district's 12 elementary schools to the three middle schools in order to alleviate overcrowding. Also at that time, Intermediate West was renamed Intermediate North. Intermediate East and Intermediate North are currently the two most populous middle schools in New Jersey.\n\nTo raise money for the schools, the district created Toms River Fest, a major festival held during the summer in 2005, 2006 and 2008.\n\nThe district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group \"DE\", the fifth-highest of eight groupings.

In return for a steady supply of the fluid, Brian must seek out human victims for Aylmer, so that he can eat their brains. All the while, though, as Brian adopts a heavily secluded life in his indulgence of Aylmer's fluids, it begins to draw a rift in his relationship with his girlfriend Barbara and his brother Mike.\n\nThe film climaxes with Brian allowing Aylmer to kill Barbara, soon after which he is confronted by Morris and Martha, a middle aged couple who were Aylmer's previous hosts before he escaped and found Brian. Holding Brian at gun point, they retrieve Aylmer from his back, but Aylmer fights back and kills them both. But while Aylmer is feeding Brian his next dosage, Morris, who is still alive, fiercely grabs Aylmer and accidentally squeezes an overdose of his juice into Brian's brain, causing him severe agony as it goes in to overload.\n\nAylmer dies and Morris succumbs to his injuries while Brian, still in agony from the overdose, retrieves Morris's gun and shoots himself in the head after returning to the apartment he shares with Mike.

When it was released on home video, it acquired a cult following, and his later films were compared to it.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 69% of thirteen surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.4/10. Walter Goodman of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"brainless movie\" with poor special effects and bad acting.

{"id": "1923494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923494", "title": "Material efficiency", "text": "Material efficiency\n\nMaterial efficiency is a description or metric which expresses the degree in which raw materials are consumed, incorporated, or wasted, as compared to previous measures in construction projects or physical processes. Making a usable item out of thinner stock than a prior version increases the material efficiency of the manufacturing process. Material efficiency goes hand in hand with Green building and Energy conservation, as well as any other ways of incorporating Renewable resource's in the building process from start to finish.\n\nMaterial efficiency can also mean the degree in which a material can handle a particular load, strain or weight upon it. Material efficiency can be achieved through using recycled materials, materials that use renewable energy, and other ways. For example, using recycled steel instead of new steel \"reduces the energy produced in making the steel by 75 percent, and saves space in landfills as well.\" Material efficiency, \"entails the pursuit of the technical strategies, business models, consumer preferences and policy instruments that would lead to a substantial reduction in the production of high-volume energy-intensive materials required to deliver human well-being. The motivations for material efficiency include reducing energy demand, reducing the emissions and other environmental impacts of industry, and increasing national resource security. With a growing population and increasing wealth, demand for material extraction and processing is likely to double in the next 40 years. The environmental impacts of the required processing will become critical.\"\n\nUsing materials that are more \"efficient\" in the building process today can be less expensive and energy intensive than using new building materials. An example of this would be using recycled steel to erect the frame of a building instead of using wooden timbers. Using recycled steel saves room in landfills that the steel would otherwise be taking up, saves 75% of the energy required to produce steel in the production process, and saves trees from being cut down to build homes. The recycled steel can be fashioned in the exact dimensions needed for building and can be made into \"customized steel beams and panels to fit each specific design.\" These new, more efficient materials, can cost more initially when being used in building but in time will save money through lower heating/cooling bills, lower electric bills, and other kinds of bills. Over time you can recoup your money and save even more all the while staying comfortable inside your home.\n\nThere are three types of light bulbs today that are very popular: Incandescent Light Bulbs, Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFL's), and Light Emitting Diodes (LED's). Electric lighting alone can account for around 14% of your current home energy bill. In addition to this, only 10 percent of the electricity used by an incandescent bulb generates light; the rest is wasted. Here are two tables comparing the three types of lightbulbs:\n\nAnother way to reduce electricity consumption and save money with lighting is by installing dimming switches with these bulbs. A dimmer can increase and decrease the amount of light emitted by the bulb to your liking. It can not make a light bulb brighter than its maximum already is but it can reduce it thus using less electricity and saving you money.\n\nPopular materials used for insulation are fiber glass, rock wool, and slag wool. After being manufactured these items require no energy to use and require no maintenance unless damaged. Using inflation properly is the most effective way to reduce energy use and green house gas emissions.\n\nFacts about today's insulation:\n\nThere is a new \"generation\" of insulation being released to the public recently. Plant-based Polyurethane Rigid Foam is made from plants such as bamboo, hemp, and kelp, that \"offers high moisture and heat resistance, excellent acoustics and protection against mold and pests. It also has a higher R-value than fiberglass or polystyrene, meaning that it has a higher thermal resistance and insulates better.\" The hygroscopic properties of bio-based insulation mean that they can absorb and store moisture from the surrounding air, according to project partner Patricia María Pérez Tarancón at Acciona, Madrid, Spain. \"The material behaves as a moisture buffer,\" she says, \"This softens the relative humidity changes in the environment, reducing risks from common pollutants such as bacteria, viruses, chemical reactions, allergies and respiratory infections, as well as reducing the need for air-conditioning.\" These plant-based insulation techniques can be cheaper, healthier, save more energy in houses and buildings, as well as cut energy consumption in the manufacturing process of insulation.\n\nAnother more efficient way to cut energy consumption and save money along with newer plant-based insulation is with proper roofing. \"Cool Roofing\" involves using roofing which direct sunlight back into the atmosphere instead of being absorbed by the material and being passed into the building. This Cool Roofing can save money by lowering the cost of keeping a building cool with air conditioners. The same process can be used to keep heat in and lower the cost of a heating bill. A cool roof is one that has been designed to reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat than a standard roof. Cool roofs can be made of a highly reflective type of paint, a sheet covering, or highly reflective tiles or shingles. \nBenefits of a Cool Roof:\n\nIncorporating recycled materials into the manufacturing process of new goods is an integral change. Mineral resources are finite, such as bauxite ore for aluminum or fossil fuels to make plastics, so it is imperative to start reusing what we have already mined so that we do not deplete what is left. There are many technologies available that help tremendously with recycling efforts such as near-infrared equipment which, \"is a common sortation technology in large recycling operations and can accurately identify many different types of polymers.\" Near-infrared equipment is a much easier way to sort through plastics compared to the human eye.\n\nAluminum offers the most savings, with cans from recycled material requiring as little as 4% of the energy required to make the same cans from bauxite ore. Metals don't degrade as they're recycled in the same way plastics and paper do, fibers shortening every cycle, so many metals are prime candidates for recycling, especially considering their high value per ton compared to other recyclables.\n\nPolystyrene from recycled material costs 88% less than without recycling, but a negligible amount of polystyrene is recycled in the United States because of the difficulty sorting it from other plastics. Other plastic products like polyethylene terephthalate soft drink bottles cost 76% less to manufacture form recycled materials, and this percentage as well as the variety of plastics that can be recycled is expected to increase with new separation technologies such as froth flotation and skin flotation. [3,6] Nonetheless, plastic degrades every time it's recycled, so some plastic will always need to come directly from fossil oils if such products are to continue to be produced.\n\nPaper (in particular newspaper) and glass have lower energy savings than the previous materials, with recycled products costing 45% and 21% less energy respectively. Recycled paper has a large market in China, although work still needs to be done to facilitate mixed paper recycling as opposed to newspaper.\n\nIf we were to utilize these recycling methods we would not have to expend energy and resources on mining for new resources to use in manufacturing. Recycled aluminum, for example, has the same properties as newly manufactured aluminum but expends so much less energy in the manufacturing process. This is assuming however that recycling plants are being run in the most efficient ways possible.\n\nReusing current materials uses even less energy than recycling. Reusing is preferred to recycling because it eliminates the cost of transport to a recycling plant, sorting, re-manufacturing, distributing, and there are no wages needed to be paid to employees for doing these tasks. Reusable containers only have to be manufactured once for hundreds or thousands of uses (such as a water bottle used every day for years), and the energy cost between uses is approximately that of cleaning the container with soap and water, a negligible expense compared to sorting, melting down, and pouring the material into a mold again, for example. Reusing containers could, in theory, replace recyclable containers and one-use containers, if made out of a durable enough material. There are inconveniences that go along with reusing materials however. Some of these inconveniences include having to clean the containers between uses, carrying around full or empty containers, and they require a time commitment due to having to hold on to them instead of throwing them away.\n\nFor products with glass containers, a deposit-refund system to encourage people to return the containers to the store for reuse seems more useful than recycling, given glass's durability and the small energy savings for recycling it. Reuse doesn't work as well for printed paper, or for non-container metal or plastic items such as electronics or packing material, so recycling may still be the best option in these cases.\n\n"}

The famous silk laces were introduced in the 18th century. \"Chantilly lace\", was also produced in the 19th century but this one was actually made not in Chantilly area but in the French Norman town Bayeux and in Geraardsbergen, now in Belgium.\n\nChantilly lace is known for its fine ground, outlined pattern, and abundant detail. The pattern is outlined in \"cordonnet\", a flat untwisted strand. The best Chantilly laces were made of silk, and were generally black, which made them suitable for mourning wear. White Chantilly lace was also made, both in linen and silk, though most Chantilly laces were made of silk. The black silk Chantilly lace became especially popular, and there was a large market for it in Spain and the Americas. Chantilly and the Spanish laces (such as blonde lace) were the most popular black laces. Little white Chantilly was ever made. Another notable thing about Chantilly lace is the use of a half-and-whole stitch as a fill to achieve the effect of light and shadow in the pattern, which was generally of flowers. The background, or \"réseau\", was in the form of a six pointed star, and was made of the same thread as the pattern, unlike the otherwise similar blonde lace. The lace was produced in strips approximately four inches wide, and then joined with a stitch that left no visible seam.\n\nChantilly lace remained popular in the 19th century, when every fashionable lady had a black or white Chantilly shawl, made in Brussels or Ghent.\n\nIn the 17th century, the Duchesse de Longueville organised the manufacture of lace at Chantilly. It has been produced from then until the present day. It became popular because of the duchesse's patronage and Chantilly's proximity to Paris and came into fashion again during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI; it was a special favorite of Louis XV's last mistress, Mme du Barry, and of Marie Antoinette. When the French Revolution began in 1789, demand for the lace ceased. The lace-makers were seen as protégés of the royals, and after Mme du Barry and Marie Antoinette were guillotined in 1793, the lace-makers of Chantilly were themselves killed. At this point production ceased.\n\nNapoleon I sponsored a revival of Chantilly lace between the years 1804 and 1815. At this point production was concentrated in Normandy, mainly around the Bayeux area. While it was no longer being made in Chantilly, all of the old techniques and designs were used. Chantilly lace reached the height of its popularity around 1830 and was revived again in the 1860s, at which point it was made at Bayeux as well as at Geraardsbergen, in what is nowadays Belgium.\n\nIn 1844, a machine was patented that made Valenciennes lace and black silk Chantilly lace that was difficult to distinguish from the handmade lace.\n\n"}

The work received its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 December 1918.\n\nAround 1904, Puccini first began planning a set of one-act operas, largely because of the success of Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\". Originally, he planned to write each opera to reflect one of the parts of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". However, he eventually based only \"Gianni Schicchi\" on Dante's epic poem. The link in the final work is that each opera deals with the concealment of a death.\n\nPuccini also intended that the three should be performed as a set, and wrote to Casa Ricordi to complain about their giving permission in 1920 to The Royal Opera, London, \"for \"Tabarro\" and \"Schicchi\" without \"Angelica\"\". He reluctantly agreed that the two operas could be given in a programme with Serge Diaghilev's \"Ballets Russes\", but when he heard that \"Il tabarro\" had also been dropped, he wrote to his friend Sybil Seligman to say \"I very much dislike \"Trittico\" being given in bits – I gave permission for \"two\" operas, and not \"one\", in conjunction with the Russian Ballet.\" \n\nToday, it is quite common to see only one or two of the \"trittico\" operas performed in an evening, and sometimes one of them may be paired with another one-act opera by a different composer.\n\nThe operas premiered at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 December 1918. The critical reviews for \"Il trittico\" were mixed; most critics agreed that \"Gianni Schicchi\" was the best of the three operas.\n\n\"Il trittico\" premiered in Rome on 11 January 1919. Puccini, who had not been present for the New York premiere, attended the production at the Rome Opera House. The Rome production, especially \"Gianni Schicchi\", received positive reviews. Later that year, the triptych was staged at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires (25 June) with Tullio Serafin conducting and in Chicago (6 December). After these initial premieres, most opera companies began to perform the operas separately; \"Gianni Schicchi\" would eventually become the most frequently performed of the set.\n\nA critically acclaimed production at the Metropolitan Opera opened on 20 April 2007, directed by Jack O'Brien and was broadcast on television by PBS's \"Great Performances at the Met\" series. In this production \"Il tabarro\" was moved from 1910 to 1927, \"Suor Angelica\" was moved from the 17th century to 1938, and \"Gianni Schicchi\" was moved from 1299 to 1959.\n\n\"A complete synopsis of each opera may be found in their individual articles\"\n\nThe opera is dark and brooding, with the violence and grit associated with verismo opera.\n\nThis second opera, Puccini's personal favorite (but usually the one to be omitted if only two of the operas are performed), is an uplifting tale of religious redemption.\n\nThe third opera is the most popular, a farce full of greed and conniving.\n\nNotes\n\nCited sources\nOther sources\n"}

Wolof music takes its roots from the Serer musical tradition, particularly from the Serer pre-colonial Kingdom of Saloum. Virtually all Wolof musical terminology including musical instruments comes from the Serer language.\n\nWolof musicians were traditionally drawn from the griots (\"géwél\"), or of the blacksmith caste (\"tëgg\"), who were masters of drumming. Griots taught history, ethics and religion using their songs and recitations, and were employed by powerful members of the community as praise-singers and historians. Today many modern Wolof musicians still come from Griot families. \n\nAfter the 19th century conversion of major Wolof kingdoms to Islam, the \"tagg\", or ode song in Wolof, was reused in an Islamic Nasheed tradition—an important integration of pre-Islamic style into the new Muslim paradigm.\nWolof folk instruments include the \"xalam\" or \"halam\", which is a five-stringed lute, very important in Wolof folk music, the sabar drums, an ensemble of seven different drums, each differently tuned, and the hourglass talking drum called a \"tama\". The Qadiriyyah Sufi order use tabla drums.\n\nModern Wolof musicians have incorporated instruments usually associated with the neighboring Serer, Fula and Mandinka, including the Fula flute, the Mandinka balafon, the Maures tabla drums, the Mandinka kora (a West African harp), the riiti (a Fula single-stringed bowed instrument), the Serer instruments i.e. tama, the sabar, the junjung, and the Serer motifs and genres i.e. mbalax (from Serer-njuup), \"mbeng mbeng\", \"baka\", tassou, etc.\n\nThe late Serer-diva Yandé Codou Sène was a practitioner of the Tassou (var : \"Tasú\"), a \"form of sung and chanted poetry central to both everyday and ritual Serer life that is also used explicitly by the Wolof, Fula, Mandinka, Bambara and other regional ethnic groups.\"\n\nWolof music has unique dance rhythms. Farwoudiar (in Serer) is a women's dance with a distinct \"tama\" accompaniment in which women celebrate their prospective husbands (based on Serer marital tradition).\n\n\n\n"}

It is a bedroom community of Saskatoon. It is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344. The community is served by the Saskatoon/Richter Field Aerodrome located immediately west of the city across Highway 12.\n\nIn 1939, Isaac and Dave Martens purchased land north of Saskatoon. They then sold three small parcels of land to people who wanted to move out of Saskatoon and, as a result, the community of Martensville was created. Many Mennonites who worked in Saskatoon chose to live there to retain connections to the large Mennonite community of the Hague-Osler area.\n\nMartensville was later incorporated as a village in 1966 and as a town three years later in 1969. Sewer and water was established in 1976 with the town experiencing accelerated growth. In 1992, the town was rocked by an alleged satanic sex scandal which made national headlines, also known as the Martensville satanic sex scandal. In 2009, Martensville was incorporated as a city.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Canadian census, the population of the Martensville is approximately 9,645, making the city the eleventh largest city in the province. The city was granted city status on November 3, 2009.\n\nMartensville, located between the North Saskatchewan River and South Saskatchewan River, is between to above sea level. Martensville is located just north of the moist mixed grasslands area typical of Saskatoon, and locates instead in an ecoregion of aspen parkland. It is located just north of Saskatoon, and southwest of Clarkboro Ferry, which crosses the South Saskatchewan River. The 10 km distance between Martensville and Warman is the closest between two chartered cities in the province. By comparison, Martensville is approximately 18 km north of downtown Saskatoon, its next closest neighbour.\nMartensville is in a dry-prairie/savanna biome and experiences warm summers and very cold winters. Martensville has four distinct seasons. Average temperatures range from −17 °C in January to 18 °C in July. Martensville is fairly dry; with the summer being the wettest season. It belongs to the continental climate region of Canada which typifies warm summers according to the Köppen climate classification.\nThe geology of the area are sandy plains which resulted from shorelines of glacial lakes and depositions from glacial lakes as the Laurentide Ice Sheet left the area. There are no large lakes in this area due to the sandy soils which drained away melting glacial waters. The lakes in this area are remnants of the South Saskatchewan river channels.\n\nMartensville has a mayor as the highest ranking government official. Kent Muench currently holds the position as mayor of Martensville, having been sworn in on November 6, 2012. They also elects aldermen or councillors to form the municipal council.\n\nProvincially Martensville is within the Martensville-Warman constituency served by their MLA, who is currently Nancy Heppner.\n\nMartensville is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by MP of the Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek riding; currently it is held by Kelly Block of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe city does not have its own police service and is in contract with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for protective services along with Corman Park Police Service and the Saskatoon Police Service, who provide additional assistance when needed.\n\nMartensville received its first school in 1953. Martensville is served by three public elementary schools, one catholic elementary school and one high school in the Prairie Spirit School Division. Valley Manor Elementary School is located on the south side of Martensville, while Venture Heights Elementary School and the Martensville High School are both located on the north side. Each school has an enrollment of over seven hundred students. In the spring of 2008, CA$698,000 was allocated for portable classrooms at Valley Manor and Venture Heights Schools. A new public K-8 school will be opening for the 2017–2018 school year. Lake Vista Public School will be able to accommodate 450 students and is located in the new Lake Vista neighborhood.\n\nHistorically pupils were served by the Halcyonia School District #1237 one-room school house at South West Section 28 township 40 Range 8 W of the 3 meridian, which was established by the historical Rural Municipality number 384. Some pupils may have attended Virtue one-room school house #2616, which was built at a later date at Tsp 38 Rge 6 W of the 3 meridian.\n\nIn 2010, Catholic residents in Martensville formed a local Catholic school division which amalgamated with Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools shortly thereafter. It was revealed on June 23, 2015, that the division's new elementary school in Martensville will be named Holy Mary Catholic School and it is expected to be complete by 2017.\n\nThe city has seven lakes that are connected through a series of canals. The lakes and creeks are part of the Opimihaw Creek system. The lakes were created for water retention but are also used for a variety of year-round recreational activities including perch fishing, canoeing, and skating.\n\nThe city has a new outdoor pool facility that opened in the summer of 2010. The facility includes a six-lane junior olympic-sized pool, a zero-depth entry pool, and a toddler pool. There are four waterslides and several spray features. It has a full-service concession and is right next to the community centre.\n\nWanuskewin Heritage Park, a Provincial Heritage Property and interpretive centre, is located from Martensville, and the Sutherland Bird Sanctuary is within .\n\nSee the article on Saskatoon for additional regional points of interest shared with Martensville.\n\nMartensville holds its annual Buster Days festival every June, usually in the first or second week. Buster Days is a 3-day festival that includes a parade, dances, softball, and, as of 2005, a volleyball tournament. Before 2005, a small exhibition took place that offered amusement rides, games, and food. Otherwise, its close proximity to Saskatoon - in particular the SaskTel Center - allows residents easy access to that city's events and attractions.\n\nSports venues in Martensville include a kart racing track (Saskatoon Kart Racers), the North Ridge Centennial Centre, Chrome Dome Park (ball diamonds and soccer pitches and Geransky multipurpose field), Kinsmen Park (tennis, skate park, walking trails, ball diamonds, tobogan hill), North Hills Park, Sport Centre (rink where the Marauders. play hockey and curling rink), aquatic facility and various neighbourhood parks. Adjacent to Kinsmen Park is the Martensville Athletic Pavilion. The Athletic Pavilion is a multipurpose indoor 50,000 square foot athletic facility. The Athletic Pavilion features various court spaces and multi-purpose rooms, a running track and fitness gym in addition to a reception area and concession.\n\nMartensville also hosts the Martensville Mustangs, who are a part of the Martensville Minor Baseball Association (MMBA),\nas well as the Martensville Maddogs football team and the high school team Martensville Royals.\n\nThe city used to have a small golf course, but in May 2008 it was demolished to make way for new houses and a public swimming pool. Martensville's bowling alley was also closed in 2008, and replaced by a gym in late 2009. In the summer of 2008, the former bowling alley was used as a filming location for the second season of the Canadian television show, \"Rabbit Falls\".\n\nSeveral major trucking routes radiate north from Saskatoon; Idylwyld Drive North, Highway 11 (Louis Riel Trail) to Prince Albert via Warman]], and Highway 12 to Blaine Lake via Martensville concurrency.\n\nMartensville is located about from the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport.\n\nMartensville and Warman are the only Saskatchewan cities without a full hospital; the closest hospital for both cities is Saskatoon City Hospital.\n\nIn 2011, the intersection of Centennial Drive and Main Street received the first traffic signals in Martensville's history. Five years later, the city installed traffic signals at Centennial Drive and 3rd Street North. In June 2018, as part of the Martensville overpass project, a new exit ramp added saw the installation of traffic signals at Centennial Drive and 4th Street South.\n\nFrom 2007 to present Martensville is serviced by a weekly local newspaper, \"The Martensville Messenger\". Martensville shares other print, radio and television media with its larger neighbour, Saskatoon. Martensville is currently one of only two cities in Saskatchewan without a local radio station, the other being Warman.\n\n"}

It included a mission, San Miguel de Cuellar de los Adaes, and a presidio, Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Los Adaes (Our Lady of the Pillar of the Adaes). The name Adaes represents the indigenous Adai people, who were to be served by the mission.\n\nThe site, now preserved in the state-run Los Adaes State Historic Site, is located on Louisiana Highway 485 in present-day Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n\nAlthough Spain claimed much of the Gulf Coast of North America as part of its colonial territory, it largely ignored the region to the east of the Rio Grande throughout the 17th century. In 1699, French forts were established at Biloxi Bay and on the Mississippi River, ending Spain's exclusive control of the Gulf Coast. The Spanish recognized that French encroachment could threaten other Spanish areas, and they ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between New Spain and French settlements in Louisiana.\n\nOn April 12, 1716, an expedition led by Domingo Ramón left San Juan Bautista for Tejas, intending to establish four missions and a presidio. At the same time, the French were building a fort in Natchitoches, having founded the town in 1714. The Spanish countered by founding two more missions just west of Natchitoches, including San Miguel de los Adaes (for a total of six missions in the region). The latter two missions were located in a disputed area; France claimed the Sabine River to be the western boundary of colonial Louisiana, while Spain claimed the Red River was the eastern boundary of colonial Texas, leaving an overlap of .\n\nIn 1719, European powers embarked on the War of the Quadruple Alliance. In June 1719, 7 Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of the mission of San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the nations were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming; the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.\n\nThe Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo volunteered to reconquer Spanish Texas and raised an army of 500 soldiers. By July 1721 Aguayo reached the Neches River. His expedition encountered a French force \"en route\" to attack San Antonio de Bexar. The outnumbered Frenchmen agreed to retreat to Louisiana. Aguayo then ordered the building of a new presidio Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Los Adaes, located near present-day Robeline, Louisiana, only 12 miles (19 km) from Natchitoches. The new fort became the first capital of Texas, and it was guarded by 6 cannon and a garrison of 100 soldiers. All six of the eastern Tejas missions were reopened, under the protection of the new presidio.\n\nSpain discouraged manufacturing in its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including all of those in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels in the hopes of dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Vera Cruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Because of the great distance between Los Adaes and the rest of the populated portions of Texas, the settlers in the area turned most often to the French colonists in neighboring Natchitoches, Louisiana, for trade. Without many goods to trade, however, the Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.\n\nAlthough the Spanish settlers in the area did not encounter hostile Native Americans, since the local Caddoan-speaking peoples were friendly, the Franciscan missionaries were unsuccessful in converting the local people to Catholicism. After many years of frustration in this regard, in 1768 the College of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Zacatecas, which was the sponsor of the missionaries at Los Adaes, recalled their missionaries, and the mission was closed.\n\nOn November 3, 1762, as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded the portion of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain. \nWith France no longer a threat to Spain's North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis de Rubi to inspect all of the presidios on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future. Rubi recommended that eastern Texas be totally abandoned, with all the population moving to San Antonio. With Louisiana in Spanish control, there was no need for Los Adaes to reside so closely to Natchitoches, especially after the missions had relocated to San Antonio. In August 1768, the acting governor, Juan María Vicencio, Baron de Ripperdá, moved his headquarters and the garrison to San Antonio, and in 1772 San Antonio became the new capital of Tejas.\n\nThe settlers who had lived near Los Adaes were forced to resettle in San Antonio, in 1773. In the six years between the inspection and the removal of the settlers, the population of eastern Tejas had increased from 200 settlers of European descent to 500 people, a mixture of Spanish, French, Indians, and a few blacks. The settlers were given only five days to prepare for the move to San Antonio. Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.\n\nAfter vociferously protesting, the former residents of eastern Tejas were allowed to leave San Antonio the following year (1774); but they were not allowed to locate beyond the Trinity River, 175 miles (282 km) from Natchitoches. In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the new settlement. The former Los Adaes settlers chose to move farther east to the old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name. The new town quickly became a waystation for contraband.\n\nThe site of Los Adaes was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n\nToday the site of Los Adaes is the Los Adaes State Historic Site near the town of Robeline, Louisiana. The Los Adaes site has proven to be one of the most important archaeological sites in the US for the study of colonial Spanish culture.\n\nDr. Hiram F. \"Pete\" Gregory Jr., an archaeologist at nearby Northwestern State University, conducted landmark excavations at the historic presidio from the 1960s through the 1980s. In the 1990s, the state appointed Dr. George Avery to the newly created position of station archaeologist of the Los Adaes State Commemorative Area (as it was called at the time). In this capacity, Avery contributed a great deal in his own right. Los Adaes has since lost its station archaeologist position. However, Avery, Gregory, and other archaeologists specializing in the Spanish colonial borderlands continue to advance the knowledge of this frontier outpost. Gregory, in particular, has championed the need for more academic interest in Los Adaes and the colonial history of northern and central Louisiana in general.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1923524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923524", "title": "Simultaneous exhibition", "text": "Simultaneous exhibition\n\nA simultaneous exhibition or simultaneous display is a board game exhibition (commonly chess or Go) in which one player (typically of high rank, such as a grandmaster or dan-level player) plays multiple games at a time with a number of other players. Such an exhibition is often referred to simply as a \"simul\".\n\nIn a regular simul, no chess clocks are used (if they are involved it is called a \"clock simul\"). The boards are usually arranged in a large circle or square and the exhibitor walks from board to board in a fixed order. Each individual participant is expected to make a move when the exhibitor arrives at his/her board. The exhibitor may pause briefly before playing his/her move, but will typically attempt to avoid lengthy pauses because too many such pauses will cause the exhibition to continue for an extended period. Longer exhibitions increase the risk of fatigue-induced blunders on the part of the exhibitor, especially since the individual participants remaining at the end tend to be the stronger players who represent the exhibitor's most challenging opponents. As games are finished off, they are usually not replaced and only a few games will remain in progress at the end of the exhibition. At this point clocks are sometimes introduced with each side getting a fixed amount of time. In most regular simuls, the exhibitor plays White in all the games and the individual participants are of varying playing strengths (though they are typically below master class).\n\nIn clock simuls all the games are played as normal tournament games and are timed by a chess clock. These simuls require the exhibitor to accept a substantial time handicap since his/her clock continues to run on all boards. These simuls typically involve a relatively small number of individual participants whose playing strength is at or near master class. Occasionally, grandmasters have given blindfold simultaneous displays. In such displays, the exhibitor does not look at any of the boards, but retains all the moves of the games in his/her head. The opponents utilize boards and pieces in the standard fashion, but their moves are communicated verbally to the exhibitor by an arbiter or intermediary.\n\nDutch Grandmaster Jan Hein Donner offered the following advice to a player taking a board at a simultaneous exhibition:\n\nIf you are to stand a chance of scoring a half or a full point, there are a few things to bear in mind:\n\nHere are some significant games from simultaneous exhibitions:\n\n\n\n\nThe internet has allowed for the creation of chess game services wherein people may play an opponent from anywhere in the world. Popular sites such as Lichess may have many thousands of active online games as well as tens of thousands of viewers during any time of day around the world. This new online chess paradigm allows for world class players to be actively playing chess as well as teaching and giving demonstrations. On 13 April 2019, a simultaneous exhibition was hosted by Lichess for International Master Marc Esserman who engaged 100 players. He rapidly moved through a hundred Kings Pawn E4 opening and the matches lasted anywhere from thirty minutes to a full eight hours. Many top level players were involved and the exhibition lasted for just over eight hours. IM Marc Esserman won 82 of the games played with 11 ending in a draw.\n\nA less popular variation of simultaneous exhibition is the tandem simultaneous exhibition, also known as leapfrog simultaneous exhibition, where more than one (usually two) experts play a number of opponents, making successive moves without consulting one another.\n\n"}

{"id": "1923534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923534", "title": "Renvoi", "text": "Renvoi\n\nIn conflict of laws, renvoi (from the French, meaning \"send back\" or \"to return unopened\") is a subset of the choice of law rules and it may be applied whenever a forum court is directed to consider the law of another state.\n\n\nTo limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law be applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of renvoi is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have renvoi provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws.\n\nBut if that second country actually has choice of law rules requiring it to apply the forum law, a difference in outcome might arise depending on where the plaintiff invokes jurisdiction. Whether a difference actually emerges depends on whether the other state operates a \"Single Renvoi\" system. A single renvoi forum always refers to the other law's choice of law rules. If those rules would send the issue back to the forum court, the forum court will accept the first remission and applies its own laws. Thus, equality of outcome is always achieved so long as the competing laws operate different systems. Some early French authorities support this approach (e.g. \"Forgo's Case\" (1882) and \"Soulié's Case\" (1910)). Similarly, Article 27 of the \"Introductory Law of the German Civil Code\" (1900) adopts it. But if both sets of laws operate with either no renvoi system or single renvoi systems, forum shopping will be a potential problem.\n\nHence, there is another system called \"Double Renvoi\" or the \"Foreign Courts Doctrine\" which will also ensure parity of result so long as no other relevant law is using it. In this scenario, the forum court considers that it is sitting as the foreign court and will decide the matter as the foreign court would. In this system, there can never be more than two remissions, e.g. English forum refers to French law (a single renvoi system) so English law is applied (1st remission) and France accepts the remission (2nd and final). At present, only English law uses this approach.\n\nBecause the doctrine is considered difficult and its results are sometimes unpredictable, its application has generally been limited to:\n\nHowever, there are indications in some states that it might also apply to two issues in family law, namely the capacity to marry and the formal validity of marriage.\n\nIn the European Union, application of renvoi is expressly excluded in contract cases under article 20 of the Rome I Regulation (regulation (EC) 593/2008l formerly in Article 15 EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations, Rome 1980). It has also been rejected for contracts by most Commonwealth countries.\n\nMost states also exclude it in tort cases e.g. in the UK section 9(5) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995. Since 11 January 2009, Regulation (EC) 864/2007 (the Rome II Regulation) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations has been in force, controlling in a uniform way the rules throughout the European Union. Article 24 of this regulation provides:\" \"The application of the law of any country specified by this Regulation means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law.\"\" hence excluding the possibility of renvoi throughout the EU in tort cases.\n\nIn Australia, the doctrine of renvoi was revived by the decision of the High Court in \"Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd\" [2005] HCA 54 (29 September 2005). In this decision the High Court considered the situation of Mrs Neilson, who had injured herself falling down the stairs in her apartment in Wuhan, China. Her apartment had been provided by her husband's employer, Overseas Projects Corporation, and Mrs Neilson sued her husband's employer in negligence in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in June 1997, six years after the accident had occurred. Under Australian choice of law rules, the law of the place of the incident or \"lex loci delicti\" governs tort situations (following the decision of that court in 2002: \"Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang\"). This meant that the law relevant to the resolution of the dispute was that of the People's Republic of China. However under Chinese law, the claim would have been statute barred for exceeding the limitations period (Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China). However Mrs Neilson raised Article 146 of the General Principles in her defence, arguing that the provision of that article should apply making the relevant law for the dispute Australian law. Article 146 provided that:\n\n\"With regard to compensation for damages resulting from an infringement of rights, the law of the place in which the infringement occurred shall be applied. If both parties are nationals of the same country or domiciled in the same country, the law of their own country or of their place of domicile may also be applied\"\n\nAs a consequence, the Supreme Court trial judge concluded that Art 146 \"gives me a right to choose to apply the law of Australia because both parties are nationals of Australia.\" This decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.\n\nOn appeal to the High Court, Neilson succeeded. In six separate judgments, the majority of the High Court found in favour of Neilson on the basis that the Australian choice of law rule referred to the whole of the law of the place of the wrong. Secondly, that this meant that the applicable law was referred back to Australia and the Australian limitations statute applied, meaning that Neilson's claim was no longer statute barred.\n\nThis decision has received strident criticism by Martin Davies, and both the High Court and Full Court decisions have received very close attention by leading contemporary conflicts scholars including Andrew Lu and Lee Carroll, Elizabeth Crawford, and Mary Keyes.\n\nIt has been suggested that this messy interpretation of the Australian Court could have been avoided, had the Court followed the general practice that procedural rules always go with the forum and substantive law depends on the \"forum most interested\" analysis. However, since \"John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson\" (2000) 203 CLR 503, statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Because of this, the applicability of limitation laws no longer go with the local forum; rather, they too follow the \"lex loci delicti\".\n\nIn the United States most courts try to solve conflict of laws questions without invoking renvoi. \"In Re Schneider's Estate\", 96 N.Y.S.2d 652 (1950), is an example where renvoi is recognized as an option, in which the local court chose to apply the foreign country's laws to decide the dispute in the local court. This is most likely to happen in cases involving immovable property or domestic relationships.\n\nThere are three main difficulties in cases where renvoi may be an issue:\n"}

There are many Xhosa clans, each with their own styles of drumming and dialects.\n\nXhosa music is characteristically expressive and communicative which includes rhythmical expression of words and sounds. It also includes physical movement employed when clapping, dancing or playing a musical instrument. Different Xhosa chiefdoms share similar musical concepts.\n\nLearning traditional music begins with incentive and desire to fully share in the life of the village as almost every occasion of life including play songs for children, the girls' and boys' untshotso song as they grow, the intlombe dance parties, songs and dances of initiation practices, ancestor songs and beer songs. In order to share in the rites and ceremonies, it is necessary to learn the songs. The learning of music happens through observation, attention, developing music memory, practicing and learning rhythms from others.\n\nXhosa people often use their voices to mimic nature's sound. Among Xhosa people, overtone singing is known as 'unngqokolo' which is a word derived from the Khoisan language. Khoisan language and culture has strong influence over Xhosa music as many Khoisan music techniques and songs were assimilated into Xhosa music. Therefore, many Xhosa musical terms have Khoisan roots.\n\nXhosa overtone singing is based on Xhosa bow instruments such as the 'umrhube' and 'uhadi' which are the two fundamental sounds in Xhosa music. Xhosa traditional musicians imitate the sounds of their musical bows using their voices through the maneuvering of their tongues and shaping of the mouth cavity. They produce overtones by raising the tongue therefore creating a resonance chamber. The characteristic sound of overtone singing is created by tightening the throat muscles to create a low, gutted, rasping sound. This techniques gives particularly women, a deeper voice. Overtone singing is only practised by women and it is generally the overtone singer who leads the song. Diviners often use overtone singing as they believe that it enables them to speak to the ancestors.\n\nThe uhadi and umrhube is commonly used in Xhosa traditional music, other musical instruments include:\n\nDrums: \n\n\n"}

Frame drums are also popular in many regions of Georgia, like Kartli, Kakheti, Tusheti, Samegrelo, Racha, and Imereti. This is a single headed percussion instrument which is not only found in Northern South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, but also in parts of the Russian polar regions. The simple drum is formed by attaching a skin cover onto a wooden ring with glue and cloth ties. This is similar to the Persian daira and the Turkish def. Some daira have metal pieces attached to give them a tambourine-like quality.\n\nThe history of dayereh goes back to many centuries. An engraved bronze cup from Lorestān at the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, portrays a double ney (end-blown reed pipes), chang (harp), and dayereh in a shrine or court processional, as similarly documented in Egypt, Elam, and the Persian province of Babylonia where music was arranged for performance by large orchestral ensembles.\n\nIn the Pahlavi (Persian pre-Islamic language) the name is dareh. The poet Abu Saeed Abolkheir (967–1048) mentioned in his works, the word dayereh as a drum.\n\nThe dayereh is one of the most famous frame drums in Persia and Central Asia, and in the Pahlavi (Persian ancient language) the dayereh is called \"dareh\".\n\nIn Azerbaijan and Armenia, it is called \"ghaval\" and sometimes daf/dap, and is played on festive occasions. In Azerbaijani art music, the drum that usually accompanies the Ashigh (poet/singer) is ghaval (dayereh). A traditional ensemble contains a singer, who plays this drum, and two instrumentalists, one playing the tar (long-necked lute) and the other, the kamancheh (bowed spike fiddle).\n\nThe jingles which are thin metal plates or rings, are attached to hooks in three or four rectangular holes in the circular wooden frame. The drumhead is made of goat skin.\n\nThe width of the frame is 45–50 cm (18–20 in.) and the depth, 5–7 cm (2–3 in.). In order to bend the frame, the wood (\"buka\", \"orev\") may be softened in water before being bent around a hot metal cylinder.\n\nThe frame is closed by gluing the ends together. Finally, the skin is attached to the frame by fixing it with another wooden frame or by using nails.\n\nAnother variation is to have the ring-style jingles arranged around the edge of the inside of the drum the whole way around or to have several tiers half way around the inside edge.\n\nThe sound is produced by hitting the membrane with either hand – the left hand, which also holds the dayereh, strikes the edges, and the right hand strikes the center. The right-hand fingers are fastened about their neighbours and suddenly released (like the action of finger-snapping) to produce loud, rapid, sharp sounds.\n\nThe dayereh is a solo instrument. Most often it is supported by \"Gajda\", \"chalgija\", or \"tarabuka\". Marko Cepenkov mentions the dayereh as a companion of the \"Gajda\" in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is most often used for keeping the rhythm in Macedonian folk songs and dances, and also in traditional Macedonian rituals, like wedding ceremony.\n\n"}

He was the proprietor of the township as well as several other properties in the Connecticut Western Reserve. Root first visited the township in 1800 and his brother David was the first settler, moving to Rootstown in 1802. Rootstown was originally surveyed from the Western Reserve as survey township Town 2, Range 8 and was formally organized as a civil township in 1810 after previously having been part of Franklin Township. In 1821 the Rootstown Post Office was established. It continues today under the ZIP Code Rootstown, OH 44272 and serves much of the township. In 1832, many German immigrants came who were farmers, stonemasons and carpenters. A plague in 1845 took 49 victims, including the town's only physician, Dr. Andrew Basset. In 1850 a band of 16 whaling sea captains from Nantucket bought land, built large homes and became farmers. Nelson Converse opened the first general store in 1853 in the center of town. In 1866 the Central and Pacific Railroad was built through the northeastern part of the township.\n\nElectricity brought modern conveniences to the area in 1921, and street lights to both Rootstown and New Milford in 1949. 27 men formed the volunteer fire company in 1938. Its equipment was housed in the basement of the town hall until a new building was constructed by volunteer work and community fundraiser carnivals in 1955-1956.

Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\n\nThe Rootstown Town Hall was built in 1809 and remains in use today. It first received electricity in 1921 and indoor plumbing in 1963. In 1999 the township zoning board began using the basement of the town hall to store accumulated files and records. Today, it is located along SR 44 just south of the town center.\n\nSeveral highways pass through Rootstown Township—SR 5, SR 44, and I-76. Public transportation is provided by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA), which provides routes to Kent, Ravenna, and other parts of Portage County.\n\nRootstown Township is served by the Rootstown Local School District, which includes an elementary school serving grades K–5, a middle school for grades 6–8, and a 9th–12th grade high school. All three schools continue to be rated \"Excellent\" according to state \"Report Cards\" and continue to provide excellent educational standards to township families. All three schools are located on a central campus on State Route 44 just north of the town center. Across the street from the Rootstown Schools campus is the campus of Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED). The NEOMED campus is also home to the Bio-Med Science Academy, a grades 9-12 STEM+M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine) academy.\n\nThere are three cemeteries in Rootstown Township: the Old Cemetery, St. Peter of the Fields Cemetery, and Homeland Cemetery.\n\nThe first death in Rootstown Township was on August 31, 1808, with the death of 51-year-old Nathan Chapman, Sr. This cemetery was used until 1897 when a fire destroyed the township records. The last known burial at the Old Cemetery was in 1999.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1923576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923576", "title": "Ektachrome", "text": "Ektachrome\n\nEktachrome is a brand name owned by Kodak for a range of transparency, still, and motion picture films previously available in many formats, including 35 mm and sheet sizes to 11×14 inch size. Ektachrome has a distinctive look that became familiar to many readers of \"National Geographic\", which used it extensively for color photographs for decades in settings where Kodachrome was too slow. Ektachrome is able to take photos at shutter speeds of 1/10,000 of a second without filters.\n\nEktachrome, initially developed in the early 1940s, allowed professionals and amateurs alike to process their own films. It also made color reversal film more practical in larger formats, and the Kodachrome Professional film in sheet sizes was later discontinued.\n\nWhereas the development process used by Kodachrome is technically intricate and beyond the means of amateur photographers and smaller photographic labs, Ektachrome processing is simpler, and small professional labs could afford equipment to develop the film. Many process variants (designated E-1 through E-6) were used to develop it over the years. Modern Ektachrome films are developed using the E-6 process, which can be carried out by small labs or by a keen amateur using a basic film tank and tempering bath to maintain the temperature at 100 °F (38 °C).\n\nEktachrome has been used occasionally as a motion picture film stock, such as in the 1999 film \"Three Kings\" and the 2006 film \"Inside Man\", in which each used cross processing in C-41 color negative chemistry to give a unique appearance.\n\nSeveral years before Ektachrome's discontinuation, some of Kodak's consumer E-6 films were rebranded as Elite Chrome. In late 2009, Kodak announced the discontinuation of Ektachrome 64T (EPY) and Ektachrome 100 Plus (EPP) films, citing declining sales. On February 4, 2011, Kodak announced the discontinuance of Ektachrome 200 on its website. On March 1, 2012, Kodak announced the discontinuance of three color Ektachrome films. In December 2012 Kodak announced its discontinuance of Ektachrome 100D color reversal movie film in certain formats. By late 2013, all Ektachrome products were discontinued.\n\nOn September 25, 2018, Kodak announced that the 35 mm format of Ektachrome was again available, while Super 8 and 16 mm motion picture versions would be available later.\n\nAlthough Kodachrome is often considered a superior film due to its archival qualities and color palette, advances in dye and coupler technology blurred the boundaries between the differing processes, along with Kodak having abandoned Kodachrome research and development since the mid-1990s. Furthermore, the developing of Kodachrome always required a complex, fickle process requiring an on-site analytical lab and typically required a turnaround of several days to allow for shipping times. By contrast, small professional labs have been able to process Ektachrome on-site since the 1950s, with product safety and effluent discharge having been drastically improved since the 1970s, when Kodak reformulated their entire color chemistry lineup. It is even possible for amateur labs to process Ektachrome within an hour using a rotary tube processor (made by Jobo, WingLynch or PhotoTherm), sink-line, or even by hand inversion in a small drum and E-2, E-4, and E-6 processing chemistry kits were sold for home darkrooms.\n\n\nThere were some other Ektachrome processes for 16 mm motion picture films:\n\nThe following processes are used for amateur Ektachrome super 8 mm movie film:\n\n\nOther film manufacturers use their own designations for nearly identical processes. They include Fujifilm's process CR-55 (E-4) and CR-56 (cross-licensed with Kodak's process E-6; but with slight variations in the first developer); and the now-discontinued Agfachrome and Konica's CRK-2 (E-6 equivalent).\n\nHigh Speed Ektachrome, announced in 1959 provided an ASA 160 color film, which was much faster than Kodachrome. In 1968, Kodak started offering push processing of this film, allowing it to be used at ASA 400.\n\nThe E-4 process was generally stopped after 1977, although continued in use for Kodak PCF (Photomicrography Color Film) until the 1980s, and for Kodak IE (Color Infra-red film) until 1996. This was due to a legal commitment by Kodak to provide the process for 30 years.\n\nThe Ektachrome process differs significantly from the Agfa Process AP-41, used generally until 1983 to develop films such as Agfachrome CT18 and 50s Professional.\n\nThe Washington (W) Processing Lab operated between 1967 and July 1999. The lab facility was located in Montgomery County at the address of 1 Choke Cherry Road, Rockville, Maryland.\n\nThe Palo Alto (P) California Processing Lab was located at 925 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California.\n\nThe Rochester (R) New York Processing Lab was located at Kodak Park in Rochester, New York.\n\nThere were also Kodak processing laboratories in other locations, including Chicago, (Illinois), Hollywood, (California-H), Atlanta (Georgia), Findlay (Ohio), Toronto (Canada) and Hemel Hempstead (England).\n\nOn January 5, 2017, Kodak Alaris announced that Ektachrome would return in both ISO 100 35mm still frame and Super 8 motion picture formats, before the end of the year. However, the release date was later pushed to 2018 after it was discovered certain materials used in its manufacture were now unavailable, requiring a reformulation. Kodak will manufacture the film and market the Super 8 version. Kodak Alaris will market the 35mm still version.\n\nThe Super-8 version was exhibited at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, and was named Ektachrome 100D 7294.\n\nIn fall 2018, Kodak released the newly-formulated Ektachrome with 35mm format being the first to arrive on September 25 and in Super 8 format on October 1.\n\nOn June 1st 2019, Kodak Alaris announced a wide coating trial of Ektachrome in 120 format for the end of July. Previously, in January 2019, a Kodak Alaris representative indicated work was progressing on Ektachrome in both 120 and larger formats. This project reached completion when, on December 10th 2019, Kodak Alaris announced the availability of Ektachrome E100 in a 120-format 5-roll propack and a 4x5 box of 10 sheets.\n\n\nProcesses E-2, E-3 and E-4:\n"}

He played keyboards, sang, and wrote songs with Andrew Latimer. During his career Bardens worked alongside Rod Stewart, Mick Fleetwood, and Van Morrison. He also recorded eleven solo albums.\n\nBardens was born in Westminster London to Dennis Bardens, a novelist and biographer, and grew up in Notting Hill. He studied fine art at Byam Shaw School of Art, and learned the piano, before switching to the Hammond organ after listening to Jimmy Smith. In 1965, he spent a brief spell as the keyboard player with Them after leaving The Cheynes. After leaving Them, he formed a band called The Peter B's, releasing a single, in 1966, called \"If You Wanna Be Happy\"(B-side was,\"Jodrell Blues\"),an instrumental version of the old standard. He moved on and formed Peter B's Looners which eventually morphed into Shotgun Express, a band that played soul music and featured Rod Stewart, Peter Green, and Mick Fleetwood. Fleetwood later said Barden's recruitment into the band kick-started his musical career.\n\nFrom August 1968 to February 1970, he formed The Village with featured future Elvis Costello and The Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas and Bill Porter (drums). They released a single \"Man in the Moon\"/\"Long Time Coming\"\n\nIn 1970, Bardens recorded \"The Answer\", an album featuring Peter Green and Andy Gee. Bardens recorded an eponymous album in 1971 which was released in the United States as \"Write My Name in the Dust\" before forming Camel in 1972. He left Camel in 1978 to join Them bandmate Van Morrison's band. He recorded \"Wavelength\" with Morrison and appeared in the line up of the album's promotional tour. By the end of the 1970s, Bardens began exploring electronica and released the album \"Heart to Heart\" in 1979.\n\nBardens co-wrote \"Looking for a Good Time\" with Bobby Tench, featured as the B-side of the single \"Chain Gang\" (1982), which Tench had recorded as a tribute to Sam Cooke. During that era, Bardens also played with Alan Parsons Project. In 1984, he became a member of Keats (an Alan Parsons Project offshoot) and released an album with them. Bardens continued to release a number of solo electronic albums including \"Seen One Earth\" (1987), which found chart success in the United States. The first single from the album, \"In Dreams\", was met with commercial success as well. The song enjoyed heavy airplay on rock stations in the U.S. and Australia, where Brisbane rock station 4MMM, the most popular radio station in the country at the time, added it to their playlist. In 1988, he followed this with \"Speed of Light\" (1988) which featured Mick Fleetwood. \"Gold\" from this album was released in the U.S as a single and found some success on MTV.\n\nHe released \"Water Colours\" in 1991, and \"Big Sky\" in 1994. Also in 1994, with his former Camel bandmate Andy Ward and former members of Caravan, he formed the band Mirage for a brief European tour. A subsequent, all-American version of the band, with only Bardens and guitarist Steve Adams from the original line-up, did more touring in 1996.\n\nHis last concert, subsequent to being diagnosed with a brain tumour, was in Los Angeles in the summer of 2001. Other performers who joined him at his concert included Mick Fleetwood, John Mayall, John McVie, Sheila E. and Ben Harper.\n\nBardens died from lung cancer in Malibu in January 2002, at the age of 57 and is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

It is situated about 170 km north-west of Adelaide, and 56 km south of Port Pirie. At the , the town of Port Broughton had a population of 1,034.\n\nThe close proximity to Adelaide (two hours' drive) makes it a popular tourist destination, with the number of people in town swelling to over 4000 in the summer holidays.\n\nThe land around Port Broughton was initially used for grazing, however the local conditions were unsuitable and the land was divided up into acre lots and sold.\n\nPort Broughton was surveyed in 1871 to service the surrounding wheat and barley growers on the recommendation of Captain Henry Dale. It is on a sheltered inlet called Mundoora Arm Inlet at the extreme northern end of Yorke Peninsula. The town is named after the Broughton River (named by Edward John Eyre after William Broughton), the mouth of which is about north of the township.\n\nBuilt in 1876, the 'T'-shaped jetty was serviced by an isolated narrow gauge railway line from Mundoora, 16 km inland and uphill. The Port Broughton railway line, officially opened on 11 March 1876, brought the grain down to the port. Horses were used to tow the empty wagons uphill, but they were sent downhill powered only by gravity, with a driver to operate the brakes. The passenger service ceased on 17 September 1925, but the grain traffic continued. During January, 1926, a Fordson rail tractor displaced the animal power. From 1931, the railways contracted out the service to a private operator.\n\nThe service ceased altogether on 3 August 1942, but the tractor continued to shunt wheat wagons between the station yard and the jetty until moved elsewhere. Ketches carried the grain from the jetty 8 kilometres out into the gulf where the larger windjammers were anchored to carry the grain back to England. The windjammers ceased to call in 1949.\n\nLocomotives were proposed in 1906.\n\nIn June 1943, Edward Gage, an electrical fitter who worked for BHP in Whyalla, was killed after his Tiger Moth plane ran out of fuel and crash landed in Spencer Gulf. He was last seen flying over Port Broughton, en route to Whyalla from Parafield. A coronial inquiry followed but neither his remains nor that of the plane were found. In January 1990, Goolwa man Ron Anchor arranged a search party to find the wreck.\n\nLying on the eastern side of Spencer Gulf, Port Broughton's coastline is relatively protected, resulting in large expanses of shallow water and seagrasses, tidal flats and vast areas of mangroves that flank the inlet on which the town is built. The small town of Fisherman Bay lies 5 km north of Port Broughton and has much the same coastal features. Between the mouth of Fisherman Bay and Port Broughton lies Shag Island, an important breeding site for several species of cormorant. The Broughton River lies further north toward Port Pirie, where its estuary is located. Further inland, most of the land is fairly featureless farming country, with only fragments of the original vegetation remaining.\n\nPort Broughton was briefly home to a short lived newspaper published by William John George and James Sisely. Originally called \"Port Broughton Echo\" (1887), it was printed by the \"Northern Argus\" in Clare. It was then renamed to \"Broughton Echo\" (1887-1888), but soon ceased publication in July 1888.\n\nSince its establishment, Port Broughton's economy has largely been driven agriculture, in particular cereal crops. Commercial fishing is also an important part of the economy, with scalefish and Blue Swimmer Crabs accounting for much of the catch. Port Broughton supports a prawning fleet.\n\nLike many towns on the Yorke Peninsula, Port Broughton is a prime tourist destination, with activities such as fishing, crabbing and a variety of watersports being popular. The town has a boat ramp for such activities. The town has two caravan parks and a number of units, as well as a motel. Nearby Fisherman's Bay has many shacks belonging to holiday-makers, as well as its own small boat ramp.\n\nThe recorded population the township of Port Broughton at the time of the 2011 census was 982 (Port Broughton district population 1424). The majority of the population (838) were Australian born, with the majority of immigrants coming from the United Kingdom. The census also found that over half the population of Port Broughton is over 55, with the median age being 61, suggesting the town is popular with retirees. Christianity is the dominant religion in the region, and is well serviced by a number of churches.\n\nThe town has a number of sporting clubs including Cricket and Netball clubs, and an Australian rules football club playing in the Northern Areas Football Association as the Broughton-Mundoora Eagles.\n\nPort Broughton Area School and Port Broughton District Hospital & Health Service provide the towns educational and medical needs respectively\n\n\nPort Broughton is the seat of the District Council of Barunga West. The mayor currently is Cynthia Axford. It is in the state electoral district of Narungga and the federal Division of Grey.\n\n"}

The segment of I-95 south of the Golden Glades Interchange carries the designation of State Road 9A.\n\nSouthwest 27th Avenue begins locally at Bayshore Drive in the Coconut Grove neighborhood in Miami. The road heads north until it intersects Dixie Highway (US 1). SR 9 begins at this intersection, located between the Coral Way and Coconut Grove neighborhoods. SR 9 then makes its way north, cutting through all three sub-neighborhoods of Coral Way—Silver Bluff, Coral Gate, and Shenandoah—with a major intersection with Coral Way (SR 972) in the middle of it. After passing through Coral Way, SR 9's next major intersection is with the Tamiami Trail (US 41 / SR 90) before passing through more residential areas. The next major intersection with Flagler Street is located only a block west from the historic Miami Senior High School, as well as a half block east from the Miami-Dade County Auditorium. SR 9 continues north for a mile before its interchange with the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836). Five blocks north of the Dolphin Expressway, SR 9 crosses the Miami River into the Allapattah neighborhood. There are two major intersections in Allapatah: the first is with Northwest 36th Street (US 27 / SR 25), and the second is with the Airport Expressway (SR 112). Afterwards, SR 9 leaves Miami city limits and bisects the CDP of Brownsville. While in Brownsville, Miami's Metrorail splits the street in two, with two lanes running in either direction on both sides of the track.\n\nAfter its intersection with Northwest 79th Street (SR 934), SR 9 enters the CDPs of West Little River and Westview. In Westview, its intersection with Gratigny Road (SR 924) forms the east border and northeast corner of Miami-Dade College's North Campus, and is also a quarter mile west from the former Westview Country Club.\n\nAs it enters the city of Opa-locka, SR 9 intersects with Northwest 135th Street (SR 916) before turning to the northeast. Here, Northwest 27th Avenue continues northward as State Road 817. The signed portion of SR 9 ends at the Golden Glades Interchange later; however, SR 9 continues northward as a designation of Interstate 95 to the Georgia state line.\n\nThe section of SR 9 northeast into the Golden Glades Interchange was planned before the Interstate Highway System as a bypass to US 1. The bypass route was built next to CSX's Miami Subdivision.\n\nState Road 9A (SR 9A) is a state road in Jacksonville, Florida. It is the FDOT designation of Interstate 295.

From contemporary descriptions, the disease is believed to have been bubonic plague, which is caused by the bacterium \"Yersinia pestis\", carried by fleas associated with the black rat and other rodents. The city was crippled by the epidemic, which recurred fitfully into the early 1680s, claiming an estimated 76,000 residents.\n\nVienna, located on the River Danube , was a major trading crossroads between east and west. As a result of this traffic, the city had suffered from episodic plague outbreaks since the first wave of \"Black Death\" in the fourteenth century. The city was crowded and densely built. Descriptions indicate that there were no public sewers or drainage systems, with stinking mounds of domestic garbage littering the streets. In addition, warehouses for trade goods, which held items such as clothing, carpets, and grain for months at a time, were heavily infested with rats. Conditions in the city were considered so unhealthy and filthy, even for the time, that the plague often carried the title \"Viennese death\" in other parts of Europe.\n\nA religious order operating in Vienna, the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, created special hospitals for both children and adults during the 1679 epidemic. The basic nursing care offered in the hospitals was simple, but was generally a vast improvement over other medical and public health measures in the city. Doctors treated patients by using emetics, bloodletting, and by applying noxious ointments. The corpses of plague victims were carted to the outer edges of the city and placed in large open pits for burning. However, the pits were exposed to the open air for several days until they were nearly full, allowing ongoing infection of the rat population.\n\nTo commemorate the city's deliverance from the Great Plague and later waves of the disease, the Viennese erected monuments such as the famous Baroque Karlskirche with the associated 69 foot plague columns known as the Pestsäule.\n\nWhat has become known as the \"Great Plague of Vienna\", was actually only a subset of a much larger outbreak across Germany, Austria, Bohemia and neighboring regions. This epidemic appears to have been carried into the region from two opposing directions. It had been raging in Western Europe for many years, traveling East by trade routes. The Great Plague of London of 1665–1666, which is believed to have originated from the Netherlands in the 1650s, killed around 100,000 people, and was the first major epidemic in a series of outbreaks. In 1666 a severe plague raged in Cologne and on the Rhine, which was prolonged until 1670 in the district. In the Netherlands there was plague in 1667–1669, but there are no definite notices of it after 1672. France saw its last plague epidemic in 1668.\n\nIn the years 1675–1684 a new plague wave originated in the Ottoman Empire (Turkey and areas of the Balkans). It moved into North Africa, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Saxony, progressing generally northward. The island of Malta lost 11,000 people in an epidemic in 1675–76.\n\nThe plague of Vienna in 1679 was very severe, causing at least 76,000 deaths. Other urban centers in this area of Europe had similar levels of casualties. For instance, Prague in 1681 lost 83,000 due to plague. Dresden was affected in 1680, Magdeburg and Halle in 1682. In Halle, a mortality of 4,397 out of a population of about 10,000 was recorded. Many North German city populations fell in these years. By 1683, the plague disappeared from Germany until the epidemic of 1707.\n\nThe great plague of 1679 gave rise to the legend of \"Lieber Augustin\" (\"Dear Augustin\"). Augustin was a popular street musician, who, according to the legend, fell into a pit with bodies of plague victims, late at night when he was drunk. Augustin did not contract the disease, which may have been owed to the influence of the alcohol.\n\nAugustin is remembered in the popular folk song \"Oh du lieber Augustin\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1923615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923615", "title": "Barytocalcite", "text": "Barytocalcite\n\nBarytocalcite is an anhydrous barium calcium carbonate mineral with the chemical formula BaCa(CO). It is trimorphous with alstonite and paralstonite, that is to say the three minerals have the same formula but different structures. Baryte and quartz pseudomorphs after barytocalcite have been observed.\n\nBarytocalcite crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, typically as massive to druzy accumulations of transparent white to yellow to grey aggregates of slender prismatic crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 4 and a specific gravity of 3.64 to 3.71.\n\nIt was first described in 1824 for an occurrence in the Blagill Mine in North Pennines, Cumbria (Cumberland), England, and named for its composition.\n\nThe mineral crystallises in the monoclinic crystal system. Most sources put it in the prismatic class 2/m, with space group P2/m, but Webmin puts it in the sphenoidal class 2 with space group P2. The structure is similar to that of dolomite, but with two crystallographically different CO groups. The cation layers are stacked in an ABCABC... stacking pattern, repeating every 3 layers. The Ca ion is coordinated to 7 oxygens.\n\nAll sources give unit cell parameters whose values rounded down are a = 8.1 Å, b = 5.2 Å, c = 6.5 Å and β = 106°, with two formula units per unit cell (Z = 2). The primary source has a = 8.092 Å, b = 5.2344 Å, c = 6.544 Å, β = 106.05° and Z=2.\n\nBarytocalcite often forms oriented growths on baryte, and calcite, witherite and baryte can be epitaxial on barytocalcite. Crystals are normally short to long prismatic and striated. They are transparent to translucent, colourless, white, greyish, greenish or yellowish with a white streak and a vitreous to resinous lustre.\n\nBarytocalcite is a biaxial (-) mineral with refractive indices n = 1.525, n = 1.684 and n = 1.686. The maximum birefringence (the difference in refractive index between light travelling through the crystal with different polarizations) is δ = 0.161. The optic angle 2V is the angle between the two optic axes in a biaxial crystal. The measured values of 2V for this mineral is 15°. It is also possible to calculate a theoretical value of 2V from the measured values of the refractive indices. The calculated value for barytocalcite is 10°. If the colour of the incident light is changed, then the refractive indices are modified, and the value of 2V changes. This is known as dispersion of the optic axes. For barytocalcite the effect is weak, with 2V larger for red light than for violet light (r>v).\nThe optical directions X, Y and Z are the directions of travel of light with refractive indices n, n and n respectively. In general they are not the same as the directions a, b and c of the crystallographic axes. For barytocalcite Z is parallel to the b axis, X is at an angle of 64° to the c axis and Y is at an angle of 26° to the c axis.\n\nSources disagree about fluorescence. Webmin describes the mineral as non-fluorescent, Dana categorises it as weakly fluorescent and Mindat states that it is fluorescent dull yellow under both longwave and shortwave ultraviolet light.\n\nBarytocalcite has at least one perfect and one imperfect cleavage. It is a brittle mineral, and breaks with an uneven to conchoidal fracture. It is quite soft, with a hardness 4, the same as that of fluorite. Calcite CaCO and dolomite CaMg(CO) are carbonates where calcium Ca and magnesium Mg replace the barium in the formula for barytocalcite, BaCa(CO). These two minerals are even softer than barytocalcite, and much less dense. Barytocalcite has specific gravity 3.7. This is higher than that of calcite (2.7) or dolomite (2.85) because the barium atom is very heavy, with atomic mass 137, which is much more than magnesium at 24 and calcium at 40. Barytocalcite is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid HCl and it is not radioactive.\n\nThe type locality is the Blagill Mine, Nent Valley, Alston Moor District, North Pennines, North and Western Region, Cumbria, England. This mine is no longer operative, and it has been designated a site of Site of Special Scientific Interest so collecting is no longer allowed. In the past lustrous, transparent, prismatic crystals of barytocalcite have been found there in veins in limestone, associated with fluorite, calcite and baryte.\n\n"}

The first performance was given on 14 December 1918 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.\n\nIt is close to sunset in Paris, and the stevedores work unloading Michele's barge. Giorgetta, Michele's wife, asks her husband if she can bring wine to the workers. He agrees but does not join them because she refuses his kiss. The stevedores start dancing to the music of a nearby organ grinder and one of them steps on Giorgetta's foot. Luigi, a stevedore, dances with her, and it is evident that there is something between them. Upon hearing of Michele's return the stevedores' gathering breaks up.\n\nWork is getting scarce and Giorgetta and Michele discuss which of the stevedores should be dismissed; she prefers that it be anyone other than Luigi despite him being Michele's first choice. Soon the conversation turns into a fight. La Frugola enters, looking for Talpa, her husband and one of the stevedores. She shows everyone the fruits of her scavenging in Paris and scolds the men for their drinking. Luigi laments his lot in life, and La Frugola sings of her wish to one day buy a house in the country where she and her husband can retire. Giorgetta and Luigi sing a duet about the town where they were both born.\n\nThe stevedores depart except for Luigi, who asks Michele to dismiss him and let him off in Rouen, but Michele convinces him against this, saying there is not enough work in Rouen. When they are alone, Giorgetta asks Luigi why he requested to be dismissed; the pair acknowledge their love. They plan to meet later that evening upon the signal of a match being lit on board. By now Luigi seems determined to kill Michele and flee with Giorgetta.\n\nMichele later reminisces with Giorgetta of the days before their child died and how he could cover the two of them under his cloak. He is distressed about being twice her age; she comforts him but she still will not kiss him, and goes off.\n\nMichele wonders aloud if Giorgetta is still faithful to him and ponders who might have changed her so much. He reviews the list of men who have shared in their lives but dismisses each of them as improbable. Michele lights his pipe and Luigi, seeing it from afar, thinks that it is Giorgetta's signal. He returns to the barge and is confronted by Michele. In the ensuing fight, Michele gets the upper hand and forces Luigi to confess his affair before killing him and hiding the body under his cloak. Giorgetta returns to the barge, feigning remorse, and Michele opens wide the cloak to reveal her dead lover.\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

From the perspective of Dzogchen, the mind is merely \"vāyu\" \"breath\" in the body. Thus working with \"vāyu\" and the body is paramount, while meditation on the other hand is considered contrived and conceptual.\n\nThe late Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, a prominent proponent of trul khor, preferred to use the Sanskrit equivalent term, Yantra Yoga, when writing in English. Trul khor derives from the instructions of the Indian mahasiddhas who founded Vajrayana.\n\nTrul khor traditionally consists of 108 movements, including bodily movements (or dynamic asanas), incantations (or mantras), pranayama and visualizations.

JCW currently runs shows throughout the country. The video games \"\" and \"\" feature numerous independent wrestlers from the promotion.\n\nThe style of JCW is largely based upon hardcore wrestling. Bruce and Utsler refer to Extreme Championship Wrestling as the major influence on the company's style as well as their unique camera angles, which they compare to that of the movie \"Natural Born Killers\"; \"fading in and out, and turning all over.\" In early years of the company, talent mostly consisted of rappers and well-known names performing under parody alternate-names. The company instituted a change in the roster after changing their name, focusing more on independent and hardcore wrestlers, as well as several established names.\n\nJCW records the majority of its shows and releases them in episodes of SlamTV! and on DVDs, which are sold on its online store. It launched the JCW Wrestling School with Kevin Canady as head trainer in 2010. That December, the promotion began running bi-weekly events at The Modern Exchange in Southgate, Michigan and established a video distributing partnership with HighSpots.com. In March 2011, it launched a broadcasting website and began showing its bi-weekly events live on internet pay-per-view (iPPV).\n\nIn 1996, Insane Clown Posse released a VHS entitled \"ICP's Strangle-Mania\", which featured a compilation of death matches from the \"Outrageously Violent Wrestling From Japan\" video collection, overdubbed with their own humorous commentary. Following the release, the duo, along with local Detroit booker Dan Curtis, hosted the event \"ICP's Strangle-Mania Live\" in 1997 at the sold out St. Andrew's Hall. One year later, Curtis and the group coordinated another \"Strangle-Mania Live\" type show called Hellfire Wrestling, which would be followed by an eighty-city \"Hellfire Wrestling\" tour. Curtis booked the talent and wrote the scripts. \"Hellfire Wrestling\" sold out the Majestic Theater in Detroit. Two days after the show, Curtis was found dead in his apartment, due to a sudden diabetic problem. The \"Hellfire Wrestling\" tour was subsequently canceled.\n\nBooked by Brian Gorie and Dave Prazak, Insane Clown Posse held the first \"Juggalo Championshxt Wrestling\" event on December 19, 1999 at St. Andrews Hall in Detroit, Michigan. The event featured seven matches and included such wrestlers as The Iron Sheik, King Kong Bundy, and Abdullah the Butcher. Insane Clown Posse defeated the team of two Doink the Clowns to become the first JCW Tag Team Champions, and Evil Dead won a Hardcore Battle royal to be crowned the first JCW Heavyweight Champion. The event was filmed and released as \"JCW Vol. 1\" on May 9, 2000. Lasting 38 weeks on the Billboard Sports and Recreation Top Sellers list, the video charted as high as number 2. Prazak, however, left the company over financial issues, leaving Gorie to solely book the company.\n\nIn April and May 2000, Gorie booked a 15-city \"Strangle-Mania Live Tour\", spanning from Detroit to Denver. The tour focused less on older wrestlers and featured more younger talent such as Chris Hero and Mad Man Pondo. \"JCW Vol. 2\" was filmed during tour stops in both Cleveland and Milwaukee, and was released on July 23, 2001. The video charted as high as number 8 on the Billboard Sports and Recreation Top Sellers list. The promotion later held several matches at the first annual Gathering of the Juggalos, which it has continued to do ever since. Brian Gorie left the company shortly after, and Bruce and Utsler took full control of booking the events themselves.\n\nOn August 21, 2000, the company received mainstream exposure when wrestler Vampiro, who was also the JCW Heavyweight Champion, brought the title out with him on World Championship Wrestling's nationally televised \"WCW Monday Nitro\". He proceeded to proclaim that the JCW Heavyweight Championship was the only world title that meant anything to him before giving Tank Abbott a match for the title. The match was called by Bruce and Utsler, called under their \"3D\" and \"Gweedo\" personas, who also interfered in the match to cost Abbott the championship.\n\nIn 2002, the promotion was the second highest grossing wrestling organization in the United States. The following year, Bruce and Utsler set plans to record matches for \"JCW Vol. 3\" at the 2003 Gathering of the Juggalos. However, due to the amount of injuries sustained by the wrestlers and the rowdiness of the fans, the footage was scrapped. Another event was scheduled in Columbus, Ohio and filmed at the Newport Music Hall for the video. The event continued to bring in younger talent such as M-Dogg 20, Josh Prohibition, Nosawa, and Necro Butcher. \"JCW Vol. 3\" was released on DVD on November 11 of that year. Two weeks later, \"JCW Vol. 1\" and \"JCW Vol. 2\" were both individually re-released onto the DVD format.\n\nFollowing the release of the first three JCW videos, the company sporadically began referring to itself as Juggalo Championship Wrestling. On July 16, 2007, the company updated its website, changing all references of itself to Juggalo Championship Wrestling. Their logo, however, continued to display the words \"Juggalo Championshit Wrestling\" until late 2008. In late 2006, the company began a three-month cross-promotional rivalry with Philadelphia-based promotion Pro Wrestling Unplugged. The relationship between the companies continued after the events, as PWU owner Tod Gordon allowed multiple wrestlers to compete for JCW in their upcoming tour.\n\nIn March 2007, the company began filming the internet wrestling program \"SlamTV!\" on Insane Clown Posse’s twenty-two city tour entitled \"The Tempest Release Party\". The episodes lead up to the first annual \"Bloodymania\" wrestling event, which was held at that year's Gathering of the Juggalos. The programming featured an array of independent wrestlers, including Human Tornado, Zach Gowen, The Thomaselli Brothers, and Trent Acid, as well as several well-known wrestlers, such as The Great Muta, Justin Credible, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Scott Hall. Both the first season and Bloodymania were released on DVD later that year, and became the first wrestling videos ever sold throughout the entire Hot Topic store chain.\n\nThe post-season saw the formation of the group Juggalo World Order. Season two of \"SlamTV!\" was filmed on the \"Slam TV Tour 2008\". While shorter than the first season, the programming introduced notable manager Scott D'Amore and wrestler Raven, as well as the JCW Tag Team Tournament with eight teams. On May 17, 2008, Juggalo Championship Wrestling hosted matches at the inaugural \"Hatchet Attacks\". At the following year's event, the company held its first women's wrestling match in a decade. Both \"Bloodymania III\" and \"Bloodymania IV\" were held in the following two years with no build up from full \"SlamTV!\" seasons.\n\nIn January 2010, the company announced plans to run full-time and launched the JCW Wrestling School with Kevin Canady as head trainer. That August, Juggalo Championship Wrestling began a video distributing partnership with HighSpots.com. On December 22, it began running biweekly events at The Modern Exchange in Southgate, Michigan. All shows are planned to be taped and released on DVD. Scott Hall was made Executive Consultant to Juggalo Championship Wrestling in February 2011. Later that month, Vampiro came out of retirement and returned as both a wrestler and a company consultant. He raised hopes of developing talent, taking the company international, and, more specifically, bringing it to Latin America.\n\nThe company held its first internet pay-per-view, called Hatchet Attacks, on March 26, 2011. The event was filmed and shown live online by the venue The Rave. Juggalo Championship Wrestling later launched its own broadcasting website for its bi-weekly events, and transmitted its first self-produced internet pay-per-view on April 6. JCW would go on to hold more self-produced internet pay-per-views on April 20, May 4, May 18, June 30, July 20 and 28, 2011. The \"F*ck The Police\" internet pay-per-view would prove to be their final internet pay-per-view until holding another in May 2012 at the Hatchet Attacks supershow. The 2012 Gathering of the Juggalos was heavily hyped for a first ever face-off between Corporal Robinson and The Rude Boy, both JCW legends. The match did not take place as planned due to Corporal Robinson being released from JCW, with Psychopathic Records officially announcing that Robinson had departed from the company. At the 2013 Gathering of the Juggalos it was announced that Evil Dead and Mad Man Pondo were inducted into the new JCW Hall of Fame, being the first two inductees.\n\nSlamTV! is an internet wrestling show, broadcast by the Insane Clown Posse's wrestling promotion Juggalo Championship Wrestling. It features color commentary by \"Handsome Harley 'Gweedo' Guestella\" (Shaggy 2 Dope) and \"Diamond Donovan '3D' Douglas\" (Violent J), with \"Luscious\" Johnny Stark (Twiztid's Jamie Madrox) filling in whenever needed. Its initial run was 20 episodes, taped on a nationwide tour entitled \"The Tempest Release Party\". Until its creation, aside from three initial DVDs, the only way to view JCW was in person or home videos.\n\nJuggalo Championship Wrestling was founded largely upon hardcore wrestling, but has since blended it with the Puroresu and high flying Lucha libre wrestling styles. Their roster features a mix of independent and veteran performers. Corporal Robinson, wrestler and creative writer for the company, calls the product \"totally different than your average wrestling show. It's got crazy and outlandish characters, it's got hard hitting hardcore matches, it's got music, it's got your high flyers. It's got a little taste of every flavor.\"\n\nAlong with their unique blend of wrestling styles, several other aspects of the company have drawn comparisons to Extreme Championship Wrestling. Alex Marvez of Scripps Howard News Service has drawn parallels between the two companies' energetic fans. 1wrestling Radio host Bruce Wirt calls Juggalo Championship Wrestling a \"modern day [and] better version of ECW\" because of their fan base, wrestling styles, and original stories. Co-founders Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler themselves refer to Extreme Championship Wrestling as the major influence on the company's style as well as their unique camera angles, which they compare to that of the movie \"Natural Born Killers\"; \"fading in and out, and turning all over.\"\n\nBruce Wirt praises the company as an alternative to WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling due to its unique characteristics. Juggalo Championship Wrestling features a live musical performance at each wrestling event, leading Wirt to compare the combination to that of WWE's Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection. Shaggy 2 Dope and Kevin Gill provide commentary, which has been described as sometimes politically incorrect and \"sidesplittingly funny.\" The company also notably does not have rematch clauses, instead forcing former champions to wrestle their way back up to the main event.\n\nJuggalo Championship Wrestling began its first broadcast with the internet wrestling program SlamTV! Running from April 7, 2007 to August 4, 2008, the program aired 21 episodes in two seasons. The video release of the first season was the first wrestling DVD ever sold at the entire Hot Topic store chain. A brief series called Slam TV Express later ran for three episodes from May 25 to June 4, 2010.\n\nOn March 26, 2011, the company produced its first live internet pay-per-view (iPPV), called Hatchet Attacks. Juggalo Championship Wrestling began broadcasting bi-weekly iPPV events on April 6. The company runs most its events at The Modern Exchange in Southgate, Michigan, in what are considered television tapings. occur every several weeks at concert venues throughout the United States. Annual shows include Hatchet Attacks, Oddball Wrestling, Flashlight Wrestling, Hallowicked After Party, Big Ballas' X-Mas Party, and the company's premier wrestling event Bloodymania.\n\n\n\n"}

The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". The work is the third and final part of Puccini's \"Il trittico\" (The Triptych)—three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together. Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other \"trittico\" operas, \"Gianni Schicchi\" is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers. The aria \"O mio babbino caro\" is one of Puccini's best known, and one of the most popular arias in opera.\n\nPuccini had long considered writing a set of one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced with a lack of suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy \"Il tabarro\" and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera \"Suor Angelica\". \"Gianni Schicchi\", a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.\n\nWhen \"Il trittico\" premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera in December 1918, \"Gianni Schicchi\" became an immediate hit, whereas the other two operas were received with less enthusiasm. This pattern was broadly repeated at the Rome and London premieres and led to commercial pressures to abandon the less successful elements. Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych, by 1920 he had given his reluctant consent to separate performances. \"Gianni Schicchi\" has subsequently become the most-performed part of \"Il trittico\" and has been widely recorded.\n\nGianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti was a 13th-century Italian knight, a Florentine historical figure mentioned by Dante in the \"Inferno,\" Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another: he is told that the attacker is Schicchi, condemned to Hell for impersonating Buoso Donati and making his will highly favorable to Schicchi.\n\nThe plot used in the opera derives from an 1866 edition of \"The Divine Comedy\" by philologist Pietro Fanfani, which contained an appendix with commentary attributed to an anonymous Florentine of the 14th century. In this version, Buoso wishes to make a will, but is put off doing so by his son, Simone. Once it is too late, Simone fears that Buoso, before his illness, may have made a will unfavourable to him. Simone calls on Schicchi for advice, and Schicchi has the idea of impersonating Buoso and making a new will. Simone promises Schicchi he will be well rewarded, but Schicchi takes no chances, \"leaving\" a considerable sum and Buoso's mule to himself (though most goes to Simone), and makes the bequests conditional on Simone's distributing the estate within fifteen days, otherwise everything will go to charity.\n\nBoth Schicchi and Buoso Donati were historical characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, are based on an actual incident that took place in 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the \"Inferno\": in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the \"nouveau riche\".\n\nAccording to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano borrowed heavily from the \"commedia dell'arte\" tradition in \"Gianni Schicchi\". Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone is drawn from Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zanni. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the \"commedia dell'arte\", Balanzone, even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares the relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from \"commedia dell'arte\".\n\nAs Buoso Donati lies dead in his curtained four-poster bed, his relatives gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning the contents of his will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.\n\nAs they read, the relatives' worst fears are soon realised; Buoso has indeed bequeathed his fortune to the monastery. They break out in woe and indignation and turn to Simone, the oldest present and a former mayor of Fucecchio, but he can offer no help. Rinuccio suggests that only Gianni Schicchi can advise them what to do, but this is scorned by Zita and the rest, who sneer at Schicchi's humble origins and now say that marriage to the daughter of such a peasant is out of the question. Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria \"Avete torto\" (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to \"be off\" and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will have nothing to do with such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with \"O mio babbino caro\" (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.\n\nFirst, Schicchi establishes that no one other than those present knows that Buoso is dead. He then orders the body removed to another room. A knock announces the arrival of the doctor, Spinelloccio. Schicchi conceals himself behind the bed curtains, mimics Buoso's voice and declares that he's feeling better; he asks the doctor to return that evening. Boasting that he has never lost a patient, Spinelloccio departs. Schicchi then unveils his plan in the aria \"Si corre dal notaio\" (Run to the notary); having established in the doctor's mind that Buoso is still alive, Schicchi will disguise himself as Buoso and dictate a new will. All are delighted with the scheme, and importune Schicchi with personal requests for Buoso's various possessions, the most treasured of which are \"the mule, the house and the mills at Signa\". A funeral bell rings, and everyone fears that the news of Buoso's death has emerged, but it turns out that the bell is tolling for the death of a neighbour's Moorish servant. The relatives agree to leave the disposition of the mule, the house and the mills to Schicchi, though each in turn offers him a bribe. The women help him to change into Buoso's clothes as they sing the lyrical trio \"Spogliati, bambolino\" (Undress, little boy). Before taking his place in the bed, Schicchi warns the company of the grave punishment for those found to have falsified a will: exile from Florence together with the loss of a hand.\n\nThe notary arrives, and Schicchi starts to dictate the new will, declaring any prior will null and void. To general satisfaction he allocates the minor bequests, but when it comes to the mule, the house and the mills, he orders that these be left to \"my devoted friend Gianni Schicchi\". Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the lawyer is present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outrage when the notary leaves is accompanied by a frenzy of looting as Schicchi chases them out of what is now his house.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauretta and Rinuccio are rapt in a love duet, \"Lauretta mia\" - there is no bar to their marriage since Schicchi can provide a respectable dowry. Schicchi, returning, stands moved at the sight of the two lovers. He turns to the audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth: although the poet Dante has condemned him to hell for this trick, Schicchi asks the audience to forgive him in light of \"extenuating circumstances.\"\n\nThe one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\". With \"Tosca\" essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with \"Madama Butterfly\", were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.\n\nAfter \"Butterfly\" premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \"Will we go back to it? <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"Maria Antonietta\"<nowiki>]</nowiki> If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off \"M.A.\"\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.\n\nIn March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became \"La fanciulla del West\", although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \"tragic\" element, which became \"Il tabarro\", but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging \"Il tabarro\" in combination with his own early work \"Le Villi\", or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's entertainment. Finally, librettist Giovacchino Forzano presented the composer with two works of his own, which became \"Suor Angelica\" and \"Gianni Schicchi\". The latter would be Puccini's first setting of a comic text; although his earlier operas, for example \"La bohème\", contain comic episodes, these are merely ancillary to the drama to provide contrast.\n\nForzano wrote to Tito Ricordi, Giulio's son, on 3 March 1917:\n\nI sent the libretto of \"Suor Angelica\" to Maestro Puccini some days ago. He has declared himself – kind as he is – very satisfied ... I have also finished a brief outline of a plot based on \"Gianni Schicchi\". You know the Maestro's opinion of this subject, which is rich in possibilities and whose comic nature is quite out of the ordinary.\n\nIn fact, Puccini was at first less than enthusiastic about the idea for this comic opera – Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have little interest in the subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing \"Suor Angelica\". The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to \"Gianni Schicchi\", although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.\n\nWith the trilogy complete, Puccini had to decide on a place for the premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini received an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to have so complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could take place at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. \"Gianni Schicchi\" proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.\n\n\"Gianni Schicchi\" was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 December 1918, with Roberto Moranzoni conducting, as the final part of \"Il trittico\". While the sold-out house showed polite enthusiasm for \"Il tabarro\" and \"Suor Angelica\", \"Gianni Schicchi\" was, in the words of the \"New-York Tribune\"s critic, \"received with uproarious delight\". In the \"Evening Sun\", W.J. Henderson called it \"one of the most delightful bits ever put upon the Met stage\". The undoubted \"pearl of the evening\", he said, was Lauretta's aria \"O mio babbino caro\" which, despite a public notice forbidding encores, was repeated through popular insistence. The only singer to appear in all three works was American soprano Marie Tiffany, who played one of the lovers in \"Il tabarro\", a lay sister in \"Suor Angelica\", and Nella in \"Gianni Schicchi\". \"Il trittico\" was performed at the Met's Philadelphia opera house on 17 December with the same cast, before returning to New York for five more performances during the 1918/19 season.\n\nAt the time of the New York premiere, \"Il trittico\" was in rehearsal in Rome in preparation for an Italian premiere at the Teatro Costanzi. Puccini wrote Tito Ricordi that the rehearsals were going slowly, but that the orchestra sounded fine, at least in \"Gianni Schicchi\". The Italian premiere, more important to Puccini than the New York world premiere, took place on 11 January 1919. \"Gianni Schicchi\" was again warmly received, more so than the first two operas of \"Il trittico\". Among those dissatisfied by the triptych was Puccini's friend, the conductor Arturo Toscanini, who was in the audience for the Rome premiere. Toscanini was disgusted by the \"verismo\" of \"Il tabarro\", and left the performance after the first curtain. This caused a rift in his relationship with Puccini, who stated that he would not allow \"this god\" to conduct the London premiere, though the two were later reconciled. At the Rome premiere, the part of Rinuccio was sung by the Canadian tenor Edward Johnson, a future general manager of the Met. Johnson later recalled that, at the composer's request, he had dragged a mock-reluctant Puccini from the wings to acknowledge the house's applause.\n\nIn 1919, Puccini visited London to discuss plans for the following year's Covent Garden premiere of \"Il trittico\". This took place on 18 June 1920; King George V and Queen Mary were present, and called Puccini to their box to give him their congratulations. With Toscanini not considered, Puccini hoped that Sir Thomas Beecham would conduct the premiere, but he declined and Gaetano Bavagnoli conducted. Once again, only \"Gianni Schicchi\" was received with real warmth.\n\nOther early performances included the October 1920 production of \"Il trittico\" in German, at the Vienna State Opera. In the years following the premiere, Puccini made modifications to the three operas, but \"Gianni Schicchi\" required few. The principal change was to Rinuccio's arioso, \"Avete torto\", which was set in a higher pitch to take better advantage of the tenor voice.\n\nBy 1920 Puccini was facing increasing pressure, not only from impresarios but also from his publishing firm, Casa Ricordi, to allow \"Il trittico\" to be broken up and presented separately. Opera houses first wanted to omit \"Suor Angelica\", which had proven the least popular of the three, but some wished to omit \"Il tabarro\" as well. Puccini had left London confident that \"Il trittico\" would gain a place in the Covent Garden repertoire, but soon learned that the opera house's director, Henry V. Higgins, had removed \"Suor Angelica\", feeling that the audience disliked it. In fact, Higgins would never stage it again. Puccini vociferously objected, as did his longtime London friend, Sybil Seligman, to no avail. Higgins then decided to remove \"Il tabarro\", and stage \"Gianni Schicchi\" together with a Russian ballet presentation. Puccini retorted, \"This is a real betrayal\", but in the end gave in and permitted the performance. Puccini, however, was still convinced that the three works should be performed together, and that his original conception was being \"brutally torn to pieces\". The Metropolitan Opera joined in the dismemberment: after 1920, it would not again present the three operas together until 1975.\n\n\"Gianni Schicchi\" returned to the Met in 1926, after Puccini's death, shorn of the other two parts of its operatic triptych, but instead mated to Ruggero Leoncavallo's two-act opera \"Pagliacci\". The 1926 production, by Wilhelm von Wymetal, featured sets by Joseph Novak. In the following years at the Met, \"Gianni Schicchi\" would form part of a bill with such diverse works as Engelbert Humperdinck's \"Hänsel und Gretel\", Italo Montemezzi's \"L'amore dei tre re\", and even be incestuously mated with Puccini's own \"La bohème\". In 1952, Novak's sets were revised by Wilhelm von Wymetal in a production which remained in service until 1958.\n\nAmong the leading singers associated with the opera, Tito Gobbi was particularly prominent in the 1950s and 1960s. He first sang the role of Schicchi in the Rome production in 1951; in subsequent years he appeared in further Rome seasons, in Bologna, and at La Scala, Milan, where Renata Scotto sang Lauretta in Carlo Maestrini's production. Gobbi directed and sang in the 1969 production at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze, and later that year performed in and directed the same version at the August 1969 Edinburgh Festival.\n\nIn 1974, the Met gave \"Gianni Schicchi\" its first new production since 1926. The production, by Fabrizio Melano, was paired with the Met debut of Bartók's \"Bluebeard's Castle\". The following year, the Met revived \"Il trittico\" in the original form, combining the Melano production with new productions for the other two operas by the same director. The 1975 \"Schicchi\" featured Renata Scotto as Lauretta. Scotto also played the two other \"Il trittico\" heroines, a feat she repeated later that season, on tour, and when the three operas were again presented by the Met in 1981. When the production was revived again by the Met in 1989, Teresa Stratas sang the \"\"trittico\" hat-trick\". Lili Chookasian sang the mezzo-soprano leads in all three operas (Zita in \"Gianni Schicchi\") and Cornell MacNeil played Schicchi.\n\nGlyndebourne Festival Opera put on a 2004 double bill of \"Gianni Schicchi\" and Rachmaninoff's \"The Miserly Knight\", in which the sets for the two operas (designed by Vicki Mortimer) are back-to-back on a turntable.\n\nIn 2007 Los Angeles Opera announced that it would be staging \"Il trittico\" in the 2008/2009 season, with Woody Allen making his operatic directing debut in \"Gianni Schicchi\". The production starred baritone Sir Thomas Allen, soprano Laura Tătulescu, and tenor Saimir Pirgu. A 2015 performance, then directed by Matthew Diamond and starring Plácido Domingo in the title role, was filmed for television in association with various international broadcasters, such as Westdeutscher Rundfunk, ARTE, and NHK.\n\nThe 2007 Royal Opera House production by Richard Jones updated the action to a shabby 1940s Italy of \"unemptied chamber pots, garish floral wallpaper and damp ceilings\", with Bryn Terfel in the title role \"a masterpiece of monstrous vulgarity\". In the 2009 revival of this production, Schicchi was sung by Thomas Allen, while Gwynne Howell, as Simone, celebrated 40 years with the Royal Opera.\n\nIn reviewing the New York premiere, the critics greeted \"Gianni Schicchi\" warmly; most reviewers found it to be the best of the three operas. \"New York Herald Tribune\" critic Henry Krehbiel described it as \"so uproariously funny ... so full of life, humor, and ingenious devices\". \"The New York Times\" reviewer James Huneker considered the opera to be \"a rollicking, madcap scherzo, overflowing with merry deviltries ... And the last shall be first.\" Huneker praised De Luca as \"a most engaging rascal, fit for a minor niche in Moliere's gallery\". The \"Times\" critic was also amused by Marto Malatesta as \"The 'Kid' Gherardino, who is spanked by the irate family\".\n\nRome's critics gave \"Il trittico\" as a whole a warmer reception, but still saw \"Gianni Schicchi\" as the best of the three. Alberto Gasco in \"La tribuna\" noted, \"In terms of harmonic technique, \"Il tabarro\" and \"Schicchi\" advance quite startling elements of novelty. Nothing that contemporary art has produced escapes the studious and astute Giacomo Puccini.\" Gasco also stated that while many critics were waiting for the first two operas with their fists drawn, \"Gianni Schicchi\" disarmed these \"hired assassins\" with a \"single glance\". An anonymous reviewer in \"L'idea nazionale\" felt that the three works comprised a unified whole, but feared that Puccini was becoming less inventive. \"L'idea nazionale\" was a nationalist newspaper, and praised Puccini for returning to an Italian subject \"after so many useless Japanese, American, Parisian digressions\".\n\nModern productions, including those in an updated context, have been generally well received. Describing the 2004 Glyndebourne pairing with \"The Miserly Knight\" as \"flip sides of the same coin\", reviewer Edward Seckerson in \"The Independent\" found the \"Schicchi\" performance \"a triumph of ensemble directing and playing, ... wickedly observed, sharp, focussed and funny\". \"The New York Times\" gave a positive review to the Woody Allen 2008 production, which is set in a crowded tenement in which the boy Gherardino is practising knife thrusts. However, the critic questioned Allen's altered ending, in which Schicchi is stabbed by Zita as he addresses the audience. \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Mark Swed deemed Allen's production one of the top ten moments in classical music for 2008, and applauded it for \"hilarious wit and engaging musicality\". Allen Rich of \"Variety\" praised the piece, though he disliked Allen's idea of beginning the opera with a montage of old film clips, with credits featuring mock-Italian names.\n\nVerdi said of Puccini, early in the latter's career, that \"the symphonic element dominates in him\", and \"Gianni Schicchi\" has been compared by later analysts to that of the final \"presto\" movement of a three-movement symphony. With the fast-moving pace of the work, the set pieces are given a simpler melodic structure than those in the other two parts of the triptych. On stage, with the \"commedia dell'arte\" references, a humorous atmosphere is established from the very beginning. However, the music itself is of the 20th century; Edward Greenfield refers to its \"dissonant modernity\", with simultaneous clashing chords suggesting that \"Puccini was beginning to think in bi-tonal terms\". Alongside these dissonant passages are others which opera scholar Julian Budden calls \"bland, schoolroom diatonism\".\n\nPuccini's score is built around a series of motifs which recur through the opera, generally representing characters, situations and moods though sometimes without specific associations. The opening motif is a rapid burst of rhythmic music, described by Greenfield as of \"almost Stravinskian sharpness\", which quickly transforms into a mock-solemn dirge depicting the hypocritical grief of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the humorous and the solemn pervades the opera; critic Ernest Newman suggests that it \"keeps us perpetually suspended between the comic and the tragic\". Other principal motifs include the theme associated with the lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, introduced in Rinuccio's first solo \"Salvati! Salvati!\", and a short, formal woodwind statement which represents Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name \"Gianni Schicchi\" to a jaunty four-note phrase which becomes Schicchi's personal motif, and it is heard again as Schicchi knocks on the door before his first appearance. The best-known theme in the opera, that associated with Lauretta, is introduced in the second part of Rinuccio's aria \"Avete torto\". The theme is briefly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full expression in \"O mio babbino caro\".\n\nBudden dismisses the view that Lauretta's aria, at the midpoint of the opera, was a concession to popular taste; rather, \"its position at the turning point of the action is precisely calculated to provide a welcome moment of lyrical repose\". Andrew Davis, in his book on Puccini's late style, notes that Lauretta's aria, and the two interruptions by the young lovers (\"Addio, speranza bella\") as Schicchi mulls over the will, constitute interruptions in the Romantic style, delivered during a lengthy sequence of non-Romantic music. Another interruption, both dramatically and musically, is that provided by the appearance of Doctor Spinelloccio. The doctor's dissonant harmonies contrast sharply with the \"scena\" music for Schicchi and symbolise Spinelloccio's place as an outsider to the dramatic action of the opera.\n\nThe music historian Donald Jay Grout has written that in this opera Puccini's comic skill is \"seen at its most spontaneous, incorporating smoothly all the characteristic harmonic devices of his later period.\" Greenfield remarks on the score's inventiveness, imagination and flawless timing. Several critics have likened \"Gianni Schicchi\" to Verdi's \"Falstaff\", as both are masterpieces of operatic comedy from composers more usually associated with tragedy. Both composers took the conventions of comic opera into consideration, choosing a baritone for the principal role, setting the tenor-soprano love story against family opposition to the marriage, and constructing a hoax which permits the happy ending. Charles Osborne cites in particular the trio for three female voices, \"Spogliati, bambolino\", as equal to anything in \"Falstaff\", \"its exquisite harmonies almost turning the unprepossessing women into Wagnerian Rhine maidens\", and its lilting melody reminiscent of Rossini.\n\nAlthough the score is through-composed, within the general structure of the opera there are several identifiable numbers: four solos given to the three main characters, a trio and a brief love duet. Only Lauretta's \"O mio babbino caro\", the best-known of the solos, is separable from its context and can be sung as a concert piece.\n\nDespite its popularity as a stage work, \"Gianni Schicchi\" was not available as a recording until after the Second World War, a neglect described by a \"Gramophone\" reviewer as \"extraordinary\". One of the earliest recordings, a Turin Radio 1950 broadcast performance conducted by Alfredo Simonetto, was praised for its lively presentation but was considered by the critic Philip Hope-Wallace to be \"too rough a piece of recording to be warmly recommended\". By contrast, the 1958 recording under Gabriele Santini, with a cast including Tito Gobbi and Victoria de los Ángeles, was still being discussed nearly 50 years later as the classic performance, with Gobbi's singing at a standard rarely equalled. Among more recent recordings, that of the complete \"Trittico\" with the London Symphony Orchestra under Antonio Pappano (1998) has been generally recommended. Sadie (ed.), p. 231.</ref> There are numerous video recordings now available.\n\nAmerican composer Michael Ching wrote a one-act English-language sequel, \"Buoso's Ghost\", which had its first full staging with the Pittsburgh Opera in 1996, and its official premiere at Opera Memphis in 1997. Starting where \"Gianni Schicchi\" ends, the new opera, with a libretto by the composer, opens with \"Schicchi\"s final chords and carries the plot forward by following the sinister dealings of Buoso Donati's family, who apparently had poisoned Buoso, and the continued machinations of Schicchi, who tries to exploit this growing suspicion on his part. \"Opera News\" noted that Ching uses \"a more modern musical mode, yet avoiding excessive atonality. The score subtly introduces brief tongue-in-cheek quotations from other works, ranging from Mozart to Sondheim, plus one unmistakable interjection of Shostakovich.\" It has been performed throughout the U.S., paired with \"Gianni Schicchi\".\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

With a network of 10 offices in key financial capitals around the world, GIC invests internationally in developed market equities, emerging market equities, nominal bonds and cash, inflation-linked bonds, private equity and real estate.\n\nThe Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI) had estimated the fund's assets at US$440 billion.\n\nIn addition to GIC, the Government of Singapore owns another sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, which manages about SGD$308 billion of assets.\n\nIn 1981, Goh Keng Swee, then first Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), saw the trend of Singapore's rapidly growing foreign reserves and decided to invest Singapore's reserves for the future of the nation and the welfare of its people. He was advised by the British merchant bank, N M Rothschild & Sons, and established the GIC.\n\nThe government then embarked on a change in investment policy by investing the bulk of its foreign reserves in longer-term, high-yielding assets rather than in liquid but low-yielding assets.\n\nAn undisclosed number of those who left the MAS in 1981 went to work for the new GIC. In the late 1990s, four of its most senior positions were held by former Monetary Authority of Singapore officers.\n\nGIC has the ability to invest across a full spectrum of financial assets, from sovereign debt to infrastructure, and manages approximately 80 per cent of its portfolio in-house.\n\nTraditionally, GIC has kept a low profile in its investments. During the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2010, however, a number of its investments attracted controversy. In 2013, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the GIC was one of the most active SWF investors for the year.\n\nIn 2006, at the height of the US real estate bubble, it made a US$200 million investment in the equity of Stuyvesant Town—Peter Cooper Village, the largest apartment complex in Manhattan (as well as US$575 million in secondary loans). The management of the complex, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, defaulted on their loan in 2010, effectively wiping out the investment.\n\nIn late 2007, during the first phase of the crisis, GIC invested $11 billion Swiss francs for a 7.9% stake in the Swiss bank UBS. The loans were converted into equity in 2010, with an estimated 70% loss of value, though partially offset by a 9% fixed coupon. GIC had acknowledged that the timing for the investment could have been better. It also stated that other investments made at that time have had positive returns which offset the losses on UBS. GIC's total portfolio has fully recovered to its value prior to the global financial crisis.\n\nIn 2008, GIC invested US$6.88 billion for a 9% stake in Citigroup. In 2009, it pared its stake to less than 5%, realising a $1.6 billion profit, with another $1.6 billion paper profit on its remaining holding.\n\nOn 30 July 2013, Singapore's GIC was part of a consortium to acquire Transport et Infrastructures Gaz France (TIGF) which is Total's gas transportation and storage business for an enterprise value of €2.4 billion (US$3.25 billion). The consortium includes Snam (45%) an Italian gas storage and transport operator, Singapore's GIC (35%) and EDF (20%).\n\nAs of 2017, GIC holds around 34% of its portfolio in the US; 3% in Latin America; 6% in the rest of Americas; 6% in the United Kingdom; 12% in the Eurozone; 6% in the Middle East, Africa and the rest of Europe; 19% in Asia excluding Japan; 12% in Japan and 2% in Australasia.\n\nIn 2017 it was reported that GIC would purchase a 10% stake in British specialist bank OakNorth for 90 million pounds.\n\nIn 2008, GIC published for the first time a report containing information on its 20-year returns and more information on how it is managed and governed, and how it invests Singapore's foreign reserves.\n\nGIC does not disclose the amount of funds it manages and its annual profit and loss. Revealing the exact amount would expose the full size of Singapore's financial reserves and make it easier for speculators to attack the Singapore dollar during periods of vulnerability.\n\nSince 2011, GIC had also published the 5-year and 10-year nominal rates of return to provide a sense of the ongoing medium-term investment performance, even while GIC maintains its sights on the long term. It included two composite portfolios and volatility statistics to reflect the level of portfolio risk and to offer perspective in reading the 5-year and 10-year figures.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2017, its annualised 20-year real rate of return was 3.7%. In USD nominal terms, GIC achieved an annualised return of 5.1%, 4.3% and 5.7% for the 5-year, 10-year and 20-year time periods respectively.\n\nThe funds managed by GIC are owned by the Singapore Government. Its investment returns supplement the country's annual budget in areas such as education, R&D, health care and physical environment.\n\nAs a Fifth Schedule company under the Singapore Constitution, GIC is accountable in various key areas to the President of Singapore who is empowered under the constitution to obtain information to enable him to safeguard the country's reserves. The Auditor-General, who is appointed by the President of Singapore, submits an annual report to the President and Parliament on his audit of the Government and other bodies managing public funds.\n\nGIC manages risk by investing in a well-diversified portfolio, with a balanced distribution of asset classes and their underlying business sectors and geographies. This, too, is why GIC's performance has to be measured on the basis of its overall portfolio rather than by how much it makes or loses on individual investments. Its approach to \"risk management\" has three distinct components: portfolio risk; process risk and people risk.\n\nAs a board member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds, the successor of the International Working Group of SWFs that developed the Santiago Principles in October 2008, GIC publishes how it adopts and implements the voluntary set of principles and practices.\n\nGIC implemented a new investment framework in 2013 to give it more flexibility to focus on \"investments that may be riskier in the short term but would generate returns in the long-term.\"\n\nThe new framework defines more clearly GIC's risk and return drivers, its long-term investment objectives and the responsibilities of the GIC board and management.\n\nThe new approach sees its portfolio structured under three drivers.\n\nFirstly, a 'Reference Portfolio is 65% made up of global equities and 35% of global bonds representing global markets. It characterises the risk that the Government is prepared for GIC to take in its long-term investment strategies. Next, the Policy Portfolio is made up of six core asset classes and aims to achieve superior returns over the long horizon and is the main driver of long-term returns. Last is the Active Portfolio, which seeks to outperform the Policy Portfolio, is of skill-based strategies, adopted by GIC's management within risk limits. The skill-based strategies includes choosing investment opportunities within each asset class and investing in asset classes not contained in the simplified Policy Portfolio and cross-asset class strategies.\n\n"}

It is the second opera of the trio of operas known as \"Il trittico\" (\"The Triptych\"). It received its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on December 14, 1918.\n\nThe opera opens with scenes showing typical aspects of life in the convent – all the sisters sing hymns, the Monitor scolds two lay-sisters, everyone gathers for recreation in the courtyard. The sisters rejoice because, as the mistress of novices explains, this is the first of three evenings that occur each year when the setting sun strikes the fountain so as to turn its water golden. This event causes the sisters to remember Bianca Rosa, a sister who has died. Sister Genevieve suggests they pour some of the \"golden\" water onto her tomb.\n\nThe nuns discuss their desires. While the Monitor believes that any desire at all is wrong, Sister Genevieve confesses that she wishes to see lambs again because she used to be a shepherdess when she was a girl, and Sister Dolcina wishes for something good to eat. Sister Angelica claims to have no desires, but as soon as she says so, the nuns begin gossiping – Sister Angelica has lied, because her true desire is to hear from her wealthy, noble family, whom she has not heard from in seven years. Rumors are that she was sent to the convent in punishment. \n\nThe conversation is interrupted by the Infirmary Sister, who begs Sister Angelica to make a herbal remedy, her specialty. Two tourières arrive, bringing supplies to the convent, as well as news that a grand coach is waiting outside. Sister Angelica becomes nervous and upset, thinking rightly that someone in her family has come to visit her. The Abbess chastises Sister Angelica for her inappropriate excitement and announces the visitor, the Princess, Sister Angelica's aunt.\n\nThe Princess explains that Angelica's sister is to be married and that Angelica must sign a document renouncing her claim to her inheritance. Angelica replies that she has repented for her sin, but she cannot offer up everything in sacrifice to the Virgin – she cannot forget the memory of her illegitimate son, who was taken from her seven years ago. The Princess at first refuses to speak, but finally informs Sister Angelica that her son died of fever two years ago. Sister Angelica, devastated, signs the document and collapses in tears. The Princess leaves.\n\nSister Angelica is seized by a heavenly vision – she believes she hears her son calling for her to meet him in paradise. She makes a poison and drinks it, but realizes that in committing suicide, she has committed a mortal sin and has damned herself to eternal separation from her son. She begs the Virgin Mary for mercy and, as she dies, she sees a miracle: the Virgin Mary appears, along with Sister Angelica's son, who runs to embrace her.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCited sources\nOther sources\n\n"}

Adler\n\nStephen Louis Adler (born November 30, 1939) is an American physicist specializing in elementary particles and field theory. He is currently Professor Emeritus in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nAdler was born in New York City. He received an A.B. degree at Harvard University in 1961, where he was a Putnam Fellow, and a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1964. Adler completed his doctoral dissertation, titled \"High energy neutrino reactions and conservations hypotheses\", under the supervision of Sam Treiman. He is the son of Irving Adler, Jewish American writer, and Ruth Adler and older brother of Peggy Adler.\n\nAdler became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1966, becoming a full Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1969, and was named \"New Jersey Albert Einstein Professor\" at the Institute in 1979. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1975.\n\nHe has won the J. J. Sakurai Prize from the American Physical Society in 1988, and the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1998, among other awards.\n\nAdler's seminal papers on high energy neutrino processes, current algebras, soft pion theorems,\nsum rules, and perturbation theory anomalies helped lay the foundations for the current standard model of elementary particle physics.\n\nIn 2012, Adler contributed to a family venture when he wrote the foreword for his then 99-year-old father's 87th book, \"Solving the Riddle of Phyllotaxis: Why the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio Occur on Plants\". The book's diagrams are by his sister Peggy.\n\nIn his book \"Quantum Theory as an Emergent Phenomenon\", published 2004, Adler presented his trace dynamics, a framework in which quantum field theory emerges from a matrix theory. In this matrix theory, particles are represented by non-commuting matrices, and the matrix elements of bosonic and fermionic particles are ordinary complex numbers and non-commuting Grassmann numbers, respectively. Using the action principle, a Lagrangian can be constructed from the trace of a polynomial function of these matrices, leading to Hamiltonian equations of motion. The construction of a statistical mechanics of these matrix models leads, so Adler says, to an \"emergent effective complex quantum field theory\".\n\nAdler's Trace Dynamics has been discussed in relation to the differential space theory of quantum systems by Norbert Wiener and Amand Siegel, to its variant by David Bohm and Jeffrey Bub, and to modifications of the Schrödinger equation by additional terms such as the quantum potential term or stochastic terms, and to hidden variable theories.\n\n\n"}

The French term 'La Ronde' can mean any of the following: circling around, doing the rounds, a round of drinks, a circular dance.\n\nThe film won the BAFTA award for Best Film and was nominated for two Academy Awards; for Best Writing and Best Art Direction.\n\nThe master of ceremonies opens proceedings by telling the audience that they will see various episodes in the endless waltz of love. A prostitute takes a soldier under a bridge. The soldier picks up a chambermaid at a dance hall. The chambermaid willingly succumbs to the son of her employers. The young man starts an affair with the young wife of an older businessman. She then has an edgy discussion in bed with her husband. The husband takes a shopgirl to a private dining room and gets her drunk. The shopgirl falls for a poet, who is pursuing an affair with an actress. The actress invites a count to visit her in bed next morning. That evening, he gets drunk and ends up in the bed of the prostitute, so completing the circle.\n\nIn order of appearance:\n\nAlthough at the time of production, Schnitzler's son was still enforcing his father's stipulation that the play — \"Reigen\" (or \"La Ronde\") — should never be performed or adapted, Ophuls was able to secure the rights to it because of Schnitzler's additional stipulation that his French-language translator was to own the rights to the French version.\n\nThe film was classified by New York film censors as \"immoral\" and therefore unacceptable for public screenings. At the end of 1953, the film's producers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and, in 1954, \"La Ronde\" was approved for exhibition in New York without any cuts.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 8.21/10.\n\n\n"}

The basionym is \"Myrobalanus bellirica\" Gaertn. (Fruct. Sem. Pl. 2: 90, t. 97. 1791). William Roxburgh transferred M. bellirica to Terminalia as \"T. bellerica (Gaertn.) Roxb.\". This spelling error is now widely used, causing confusion. The correct name is Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb.\n\nThe leaves are about 15 cm long and crowded toward the ends of the branches. It is considered a good fodder for cattle. \"Terminalia bellirica\" seeds have an oil content of 40%, whose fatty-acid methyl ester meets all of the major biodiesel requirements in the US (ASTM D 6751-02, ASTM PS 121-99), Germany (DIN V 51606) and European Union (EN 14214). The seeds are called bedda nuts.\n\nIn traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine, Beleric is known as \"Bibhitaki\" (Marathi: \"Behada or Bhenda\") (\"Terminalia bellirica\"). Its fruit is used in the popular Indian herbal rasayana treatment triphala. In Sanskrit it is called \"bibhītaka\" बिभीतक. In India, Neemuch (A Town in Malwa Region of Madhya Pradesh) is a major trading centre of De-Skinned Baheda & Whole Fruits of Terminalia Bellirica . Terminalia Bellirica is widely collected in wild in Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh and is traded in Neemuch APMC Yard.\n\nAccording to Dymock, Warden, Hooper: Pharmacographia Indica 1890 :\n\"This tree, in Sanskrit Bibhita and Bibhitaka (fearless), is avoided by the Hindus of Northern India, who will not sit in its shade, as it is supposed to be inhabited by demons. Two varieties of T. belerica are found in India, one with nearly globular fruit, 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter, the other with ovate and much larger fruit. The pulp of the fruit (Beleric myrobalan) is considered by ayurvedic physicians to be astringent and laxative, and is prescribed with salt and long pepper in infections of the throat and chest. As a constituent of the triphala (three fruits), i.e., emblic, beleric and chebulic myrobalans, it is employed in a great number of diseases, and the kernel is sometimes used as an external application to inflamed parts. On account of its medicinal properties the tree bears the Sanskrit synonym of Anila-ghnaka, or \"wind-killing.\" According to the Nighantus the kernels are narcotic.\"\n\nIn the Charaka Samhita, the ancient Ayurvedic text, Bibhitaki fruits are mentioned as having qualities to alleviate disease, and bestow longevity, intellectual prowess and strength. There are several \"rasaayan\" described in the Charaka Samhita, that use Bibhitaki.\n\nDescription of Fourth Amalaka Rasaayan, which includes Bibhitaki as one of the fruits:\n\nBy this treatment, the sages regained youthfulness and attained disease-free life of many hundred years, and endowed with the strength of physique, intellect and senses, practiced penance with utmost devotion.\n\nThis kernels are eaten by the Lodha people of the Indian subcontinent for their mind-altering qualities.\n\nThe nuts of the tree are rounded but with five flatter sides. It seems to be these nuts that are used as dice in the epic poem Mahabharata and in Rigveda book 10 hymn 34. A handful of nuts would be cast on a gaming board and the players would have to call whether an odd or even number of nuts had been thrown.

It was released as a CD single in 2005 by the Romanian Television (TVR). Romanian composer Cristian Faur wrote and produced the single for Anghel, who subsequently recorded it in collaboration with Sistem. Musically, \"Let Me Try\" is an uptempo folk-influenced disco song.\n\nThe track represented Romania in the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev, Ukraine after winning the pre-selection show \"Selecția Națională\". Anghel and Sistem's win was surrounded by controversy after the second-placed Romanian singer Loredana Groza accused TVR of conspiracy and arranged voting. In Kiev, the artists qualified in first place for the Grand Final, where they came in third place with a total of 158 points. This remains Romania's best placement to date, alongside 2010's \"Playing with Fire\" by Paula Seling and Ovi. During their show, Anghel performed the song in front of Sistem, who were drumming on oil barrels and used grinding equipment to create a \"spark rain\".\n\nMusic critics gave positive reviews of the song, praising its originality and Anghel's vocal delivery. The artists were also awarded a special prize by Romanian \"V.I.P\" magazine, as well as received a nomination at the Radio România Actualități Awards. \"Let Me Try\" fared well commercially, and was given heavy airplay on television and radio stations in multiple countries. It peaked at number nine on the native Romanian Top 100. Promotion consisted of various concerts, television and festival appearances, as well as the release of an accompanying music video in 2005.\n\nAn uptempo folk-influenced disco song, \"Let Me Try\" was both written and produced by Romanian composer Cristian Faur for Romanian singer Luminița Anghel, who recorded the song in collaboration with Romanian percussion band Sistem. The latter two had already desired to collaborate since 2001, when Anghel won the first prize at that year's Golden Stag Festival.\n\nAnghel and Sistem promoted the song \"intensely\" in the last week prior to the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, where it was submitted, which allegedly attracted many televotes. Similar promotion through concerts, television and festival appearances occurred after they had been selected as the Romanian entrants for the contest, partially interfering with the preparation for their show at Eurovision. A music video for \"Let Me Try\" was also released in 2005 and included on an enhanced CD release of the single that year. It features Anghel performing to the song and Sistem drumming on barrels in a desert.\n\nAlthough Romanian media initially responded negatively to \"Let Me Try\", the song received positive reviews from music critics after the Eurovision Song Contest. An editor from website 9am.ro called the track \"dynamic\" and wrote that Sistem's \"industrial rhythms\" make it original. Flavia Jurca of \"Unica\" magazine listed the song in her list of memorable duets in the Romanian music industry, praising Anghel's vocal delivery and writing that Romania should have won the contest in 2005. In a 2016 poll on Wiwibloggs called \"What is your favourite Eurovision song from Romania?\", \"Let Me Try\" finished in third place with over 600 votes.\n\nAccording to a Europa FM writer, the song was given heavy airplay on television and radio stations in multiple countries after the contest. It also peaked at number nine on native Romanian Top 100. On 30 March 2005, Anghel and Sistem were awarded a special prize by \"V.I.P\" magazine, handed out by Romanian singer-songwriter Ovidiu Lipan Țăndărică. They also won Artist of the Year and received a nomination in the Best Dance-Pop Song category at the 2006 Radio România Actualități Awards. In a mid 2005 interview with Georgios Kalpakidis in Greece, Anghel revealed that her appearance at Eurovision led to proposals from the Netherlands, Hungary, Germany and England.\n\nOn 5 March 2005, the \"Selecția Națională\" was held in order to select the Romanian entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest. Subsequently, \"Let Me Try\" was chosen to represent Romania at the contest after the votes of a 12-member professional jury panel (135 points) and public televoting (10.832 phone calls) were combined, resulting in 206 points. Romanian singer Loredana Groza, who placed second in the national final with her song \"Le Le\", sparked controversy after accusing the Romanian Television (TVR) of conspiracy and arranged voting. According to Groza, TVR allegedly demanded the copyright of \"Le Le\" prior to the national selection, and a friend of hers could not vote for her as the line was continuously busy. The singer's accusations were denied by both Anghel and the organizers of the event.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2005 took place at the Palace of Sports in Kiev, Ukraine and consisted of one semi-final on 19 May, and the final on 21 May 2005. According to the then-Eurovision rules, selected countries, except the host country and the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom), were required to qualify from the semi-final to compete for the final; the top ten countries from the semi-final progressed to the final. On the first occasion, Anghel and Sistem performed 14th, preceded by Norway and followed by Hungary, while they sang fourth in the Grand Final, preceded by Malta and followed by Norway.\n\nThe artists' show consisted of Anghel performing the song, wearing a green top with a pair of jeans, in front of Sistem, who contributed to the track's instrumentation by \"wildly\" drumming on oil barrels in a similar way to German industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten. While the singer joined the group's activities during an instrumental part, Sistem also used side cutters and a grinding wheel to create what a Eurovision.de writer described as \"spark rain\" onstage. The website further found the combination between traditional music and the \"unconventional\" instruments to be \"unusual\".\nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to Romania in the semi-final and Grand Final of the contest. On the first occasion, the country finished in first place with a total of 235 points, including ten from Austria, Malta and Portugal, and 12 from Cyprus, Spain, Greece, Hungary, Israel and Moldova. In the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest, Romania finished in third position, gathering a total of 158 points, including ten awarded by Hungary and 12 by Spain, Israel and Portugal. This remains the country's best result in the contest, alongside 2010's \"Playing with Fire\" by Paula Seling and Ovi.\n"}

He has pursued a career in marketing and communications and has held senior positions within a number of people focused businesses. He was on the Board of Directors of Blue Arrow, the staffing firm, which places upwards of 20,000 people into work each day. Walker belongs to the trade union Amicus.\n\nHe stood in Ealing North in 2001. In the 2005 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for Broxbourne, succeeding Dame Marion Roe.\n\nWalker was one of the 23 MPs to sign the motion of no confidence in Speaker Michael Martin.\n\nWalker sat on the Scottish Select Committee from 2005 to 2010 and was also a member of the Public Administration Select Committee from 2007 to 2010.\n\nHe joined the Panel of Chairs in 2010 and was co-Chair of the Education Bill that went through Committee in 2011. \nIn May 2010 he was elected Vice Chairman of the 1922 Committee and in the same year was elected to the Conservative Party Board.\n\nIn December 2013 Walker was the only MP to confirm he would accept an 11% pay increase.\n\nFollowing the 2015 general election, he was returned unopposed as chairman of the Procedure Committee.\n\nWalker was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for political service, and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in Theresa May's resignation honours on 10 September 2019, \"for political and public service\".\n\nIn October 2012, he was elected as chairman of the Procedure Committee, which decides on the process for election of a new Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to his chairing duties, Walker is a member of the Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (SCIPSA) and answers Parliamentary questions on behalf of the Committee. His championship of the pay rise and membership of the Committee led to him being described by \"The Daily Telegraph\" as being in with an outside chance of becoming speaker when John Bercow stands down.\n\nIn the last parliamentary session before the 2015 general election, Walker explained what he knew about the Government decision to force a vote on changing the rules for electing a speaker for the next parliament. Conservative MPs disliked John Bercow. Walker said that he had written a report on the subject \"years ago\" but although he had talked to William Hague and Michael Gove that week, neither had told him their objectives. He had only found out via the grapevine, and stated that he would rather be an honourable fool than part of a plot. The government lost the vote and Walker received a standing ovation.\n\nWalker has lived with obsessive-compulsive disorder for more than 30 years, stating his disability in 2012 whilst Labour's Kevan Jones simultaneously described his problems with depression. Both MPs were praised for historic speeches on a taboo subject, albeit one experienced by one in four people.\n\nHe has twice won \"The Spectator\" Speech of the Year at its annual Parliamentarian of the Year Awards: the first time in 2011 and the second time in 2012 when he shared the award with Kevan Jones. He was also one of \"The Spectator\"s Parliamentarians of the Year in 2013. In 2012, he was chosen as one of the \"Telegraph\"s \"50 Great Britons\" for that year and was also one of \"The Guardian\"s \"Stories of 2012\".\n\nIn November 2013, he was awarded the President's Medal by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\nWalker is the stepson of middle distance runner and former Conservative MP Christopher Chataway.

It is common throughout the North and South Islands to Banks Peninsula (43°45′S) and Okarito (43°20′S), on the Three Kings Islands, on Raoul Island in the Kermadecs, and on the Chatham Islands. It is widespread in coastal habitats, often forming a major component of coastal forest, though it rarely dominates. Most botanists consider it to be native only to the northern half of the North Island, having been planted elsewhere by Māori near former village sites, and subsequently spread by birds. The common name karaka comes from the Māori language, and is also the Māori term for the colour orange, from the colour of the fruit. In the Chatham Islands, it is called \"kōpī\", its name in the Moriori language. It is naturalised and considered invasive in Hawaii.\n\nKaraka is a leafy canopy tree with erect or spreading branches. It grows to heights up to 15 m and has a stout trunk up to 1 m in diameter. The thick, leathery leaves are glossy, dark green above and paler beneath, 50–200 mm long, and 30–70 mm wide with petioles 10–15 mm long. In winter and spring (August to November), karaka produces stout, erect panicles of tiny flowers. Individual flowers are 4–5 mm in diameter and greenish-cream to off-white or pale yellow. The fruit is an ellipsoid to ovoid drupe 25–46 mm long, with pale yellow to orange flesh, containing a single seed. The fruit ripens in summer and autumn (January to April) and the seeds are mostly dispersed by columbiform birds which eat the fruit.\n\nThis evergreen tree is a popular place for smaller birds to sleep during the winter. It is of great value to birds and other fauna, including invertebrates that feed on their fruits and disperse their seeds. The ability to bear fruit in winter gives this plant an important ecological value, being a good food source for many species, especially birds, at a time when resources are scarce.\n\nKaraka may be easily grown from fresh seed, but cuttings are very difficult to strike. Young plants are frost-tender and sensitive to cold. The tree often naturalises in suitable habitats. It is common in cultivation and widely available for sale both in New Zealand and in suitable climates elsewhere. It was widely cultivated by the Māori.\n\nThe pulp of the fruit is edible, although bitter, but the fresh kernels contain the toxic alkaloid karakin. Accounts from the 19th century record that extensive processing was used by Māori to convert the kernels to an edible form, and mention that if the processing was not done with the greatest care, poisoning would result with symptoms including violent convulsions and severe muscle spasms which could leave the limbs permanently fixed in contorted positions. Death resulted in a few cases.\n\nThe berries are toxic if ingested by dogs and may result in death.\n\nOn the Chatham Islands this tree (locally known as \"kopi\") has played a distinguished role in the history of Moriori people: the soft bark of these trees has been used for making dendroglyphs. A report in 2000 noted the existence of 147 kopi trees with dendroglyphs, though some may not have been authentically Moriori.\n\n"}

Lord Thomas' third, and youngest, son was Richard Howard (b.1687) who died at 35 (in 1722) in Rome, where he was a Canon of St. Peter Basilica.\n\nHe succeeded as 9th Duke of Norfolk in 1732, after the death of his childless elder brother Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk. Largely at the instigation of his wife, a fellow Roman Catholic and a talented and highly regarded interior designer and embroiderer, he rebuilt Norfolk House in St James's Square in London on a grand scale and commenced the rebuilding of Worksop on a palatial scale, to rival Blenheim Palace. The latter project was abandoned after the completion of only one wing following the death of the couple's beloved nephew and heir apparent Edward Howard (1743/4-1767), the son of the Duke's younger brother Philip Howard (1687/8-1749/50) of Buckenham Tofts, Norfolk, by his second wife Henrietta Blount (d.1782), a sister of his wife. Edward died in 1767, aged 23, due to a fever he caught while playing tennis not fully recovered from measles. The Duchess was affected \"almost to distraction and she never recovered from the blow\". The couple realised that their next heir was a distant male cousin they hardly knew and who was a \"depressing\" contrast to Edward.\n\nOn 26 November 1727 he married Mary Blount (before 1712–27 May 1773), one of the three daughters and heiresses of Edward Blount (d.1726) of Blagdon in the parish of Paignton in Devon, by his wife Anne Guise, a daughter of Sir John Guise, 2nd Baronet (c. 1654–1695) of Elmore in Gloucestershire. The Blount-Guise marriage was commemorated by the surviving heraldic overmantel above the fireplace of the great hall of Blagdon manor house. This shows the initials \"EB\" and displays the arms of Blount (\"Barry nebuly of six or and sable\") impaling \"Gules, seven mascles vair 3,3,1\" (Guise) above a scroll inscribed with a Latin motto \"Lux Tua Via Mea\" (\"Your light is my path\") with the date \"1708\". James Cook named Norfolk Island in honour of the Duchess of Norfolk in 1774, although he did not know at the time that she was already dead. Howard had no progeny by Mary Blount.\n\nHe died on 20 September 1777, aged 91, without a male heir, when several of his titles (the Dukedom of Norfolk, the Earldoms of Norfolk, Arundel and Surrey, and the Barony of Maltravers) passed to his second cousin (whom he hardly knew) Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk, a grandson of Charles Howard of Greystoke, Cumberland, a brother of the 6th Duke. The Earldom of Norwich and Barony of Howard of Castle Rising, which were created for his grandfather, the 6th Duke of Norfolk, became extinct. Finally, several old English baronies created by writ including Baron Mowbray, Baron Segrave Baron Howard, Braose of Gower, Greystock, Ferrers of Wemme, Talbot, Strange of Blackmere, Furnivall and Giffard of Brimmesfield, fell into abeyance among the two daughters of his younger brother Hon. Philip Howard (1687/8-1749/50) of Buckenham Tofts in Norfolk. Most of these passed via Philip's eldest daughter Winifred Howard (1726-1753), who married William Stourton, 16th Baron Stourton (1704–1781).\n\n"}

Its bankruptcy when he was 26 freed him to pursue art. He approached Kiyokata Kaburagi to teach him, but Kaburagi instead encouraged him to study Western-style painting, which he did with Okada Saburōsuke for two years. Two years later he again applied as a student to Kaburagi, who this time accepted him.\n\nAfter seeing an exhibition of Shinsui Itō's \"Eight Views of Lake Biwa\" Hasui approached Shinsui's publisher\nShōzaburō Watanabe, who had Hasui make three experimental prints that Watanabe published in August 1918. The series \"Twelve Views of Tokyo\", \"Eight Views of the Southeast\", and the first \"Souvenirs of Travel\" of 16 prints followed in 1919, each issued two prints at a time.\n\nHasui's twelve-print \"A Collection of Scenes of Japan\" begun in 1922 went unfinished when the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake destroyed Watanabe's workshop, including the finished woodblocks for the yet-undistributed prints and Hasui's sketchbooks. Hasui travelled the Hokuriku, San'in, and San'yō regions later in 1923 and upon his return in February 1924 developed his sketches into his third \"Souvenirs of Travel\" series.\n\nKawase studied \"ukiyo-e\" and Japanese style painting at the studio of Kiyokata Kaburagi. He mainly concentrated on making watercolors of actors, everyday life and landscapes, many of them published as illustrations in books and magazines in the last few years of the Meiji period and early Taishō period.\n\nDuring the forty years of his artistic career, Hasui worked closely with Shōzaburō Watanabe, publisher and advocate of the \"shin-hanga\" movement. His works became widely known in the West through American connoisseur Robert O. Muller (1911–2003). In 1956, he was named a Living National Treasure in Japan.\n\nHasui's younger brother Kasuke moved to London in 1916 to work as an accountant for Okura and Co, he married an English woman, Clara Greenfield, they have one surviving daughter Kathleen and grand daughter Karen Kawase.\n\nHis maternal uncle was Kanagaki Robun (仮名垣 魯文) with the pen name of Nozaki Bunzō (野崎 文蔵) (1829–1894), a Japanese author and journalist, producing the first manga magazine.\n\nKawase worked almost exclusively on landscape and townscape prints based on sketches he made in Tokyo and during travels around Japan. However, his prints are not merely \"meishō\" (famous places) prints that are typical of earlier \"ukiyo-e\" masters such as Hiroshige and Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). Kawase's prints feature locales that are tranquil and obscure in urbanizing Japan.\n\nHasui considered himself a realist and employed his training in Western painting in his compositions. Like Hiroshige he made travel and landscape prints, though his subjects were less known locations rendered with naturalistic light, shade, and texture, without the captions and titles that were standard in prints of Hiroshige's age.\n\nKawase left a large body of woodblock prints and watercolors: many of the watercolors are linked to the woodblock prints. He also produced oil paintings, traditional hanging scrolls and a few \"byōbu\" (folding screens).\n\nIn the West, Kawase is mainly known as a Japanese woodblock printmaker. He and Hiroshi Yoshida are widely regarded as two of the greatest artists of the \"shin-hanga\" style, and are known especially for their landscape prints.\n\n\nAbout dating of the prints: Many of them are reprinted 1960 after Kawase's death.

{"id": "1923758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923758", "title": "Testimony of simplicity", "text": "Testimony of simplicity\n\nThe testimony of simplicity is a shorthand description of the actions generally taken by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to \"testify\" or \"bear witness\" to their beliefs that a person ought to live a simple life in order to focus on what is most important and ignore or play down what is least important.\n\nFriends believe that a person’s spiritual life and character are more important than the quantity of goods he possesses or his monetary worth. Friends also believe that one should use one’s resources, including money and time, deliberately in ways that are most likely to make life truly better for oneself and others. The word testimony describes the way that Friends \"testify\" or \"bear witness\" to their beliefs in their everyday life. A testimony is therefore not a belief, but is committed action arising out of Friends' religious experience. Testimony to simplicity includes the practice among Quakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends) of being more concerned with one’s inner condition than one’s outward appearance and with other people more than oneself.\n\nEarly Friends believed that it was important to avoid fanciness in dress, speech, and material possessions, because those things tend to distract one from waiting on God’s personal guidance. They also tend to cause a person to focus on himself more than on his fellow human beings, in violation of Jesus’ teaching to \"love thy neighbor as thyself\". This emphasis on \"plainness\", as it was called, made the Friends in certain times and places easily recognizable to the society around them, particularly by their plain dress in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nSimplicity to Friends has generally been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to what they need to live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not just about the \"nature\" of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.\nIn recent decades Friends have given the Testimony an ecological dimension: that Friends should not use more than their fair share of the Earth's limited resources.\n\nLike many aspects of Quaker life, the practice of plainness has evolved over time, although it is based on principles that have been a lasting part of Quaker thought. These principles now form part of the Quaker testimonies. Plainness is an extension of the testimony of simplicity and can still be observed today among modern Friends who do not follow fashion trends or purchase extravagant clothing.\n\nThis testimony also finds expression in the tradition of plain walls and functional furniture in Quaker meeting houses.\n\nTraditionally, wearing plain dress was an answer to a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social inequality and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.\n\nAs fashions changed over time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against contemporary clothing. As a result, the traditional forms of this practice were dropped by most Friends. Today, it is more likely that Friends will try to put their faith into action by dressing in a plain version of current fashions — such as avoiding clothing displaying designer labels. They may also try to buy only the clothing they need, and pay more for fairly traded clothing that has been made ethically.\n\nFriends used to have a strong tradition of simplicity in dress, more properly called \"plain dress\". Plain dress generally meant wearing clothes that were very similar to Amish or conservative Mennonite dress: often in dark colors and lacking adornments such as fancy (or any) pockets, buttons, buckles, lace, or embroidery. This was widely practiced until the late 19th and early 20th century, when most Friends began dressing more like the rest of society. As the Quaker Oats brand shares the Quaker name, despite having no links with the Society of Friends, there is now a somewhat popular misconception that Friends today still wear the traditional clothing. A very small minority of contemporary Friends have taken up the traditional dress once again.\n\nTraditional plain dress survived longer in the conservative branches of Quakerism, which is today represented by meetings such as Ohio Yearly Meeting, where there exist Friends who have kept plain dress alive up to the present day. The number of contemporary Friends voluntarily taking traditional plain dress back up is growing and has been called by some Quakers \"The New Plain\".\n\nThe vast majority of Quakers today are all but indistinguishable from non-Quakers as far as style of clothing is concerned.\n\nSome Conservative Friends do not self-describe this witness as being part of their simplicity testimony, but rather their integrity testimony, viewing it as an obedience to God's will rather than a witness to a human-generated ideal. Thomas Hamm, in his book \"Quakers in America\", describes a transition among most Friends from plainness to simplicity.\n\nPlainness in speech addressed other concerns than materialism: honesty, avoiding class distinction and vestiges of paganism, and the speaking of truth. These principles were put into practice by affirming rather than making an oath or shaking hands to agree upon a deal, setting fixed prices for goods, avoiding the use of honorific titles and using familiar forms for the second person pronoun. Early Friends also objected to the names of the days and months in the English language, because many of them referred to Roman or Norse gods, such as Mars (March) and Thor (Thursday), and Roman emperors, such as Julius (July). As a result, the days of the week were known as \"First Day\" for Sunday, \"Second Day\" for Monday, and so forth. Similarly, the months of the year were \"First Month\" for January, \"Second Month\" for February, and so forth. For many Friends today, this is no longer a priority, though the tradition is still kept up by some—especially in the term \"First-Day school\" for Sunday schools organized by Friends. Many Friends organizations continue to use the \"simple calendar\" for official records.\n\nEarly Friends practiced plainness in speech by not referring to people in the \"fancy\" ways that were customary. Often Friends would address high-ranking persons using the familiar forms of \"thee\" and \"thou\", instead of the respectful \"you\". Later, as \"thee\" and \"thou\" disappeared from everyday English usage, many Quakers continued to use these words as a form of \"plain speech\", though the original reason for this usage disappeared, along with \"hath\". In the twentieth century, \"thou hath\" disappeared, along with the associated second-person verb forms, so that \"thee is\" is normal. Today there are still Friends that will use \"thee\" with other Quakers. (Note: in 17th century English the forms above would have been \"thou hast\" and \"thou art\".)\n\nIn languages that today maintain the T-V distinction, usage varies. Following the British usage, early francophone Quakers preferred the use of the more informal \"tu\" to address even those who would by convention be addressed with the more formal \"vous\". In more contemporary times, however, usage has swung the other way, and French-speaking Quakers today are \"more\" likely than others to use the formal \"vous\". In part, this is a recognition of the complexity of the notion of simplicity in speech, whose intent might be understood to be not a requirement of informality, but a desire to address everyone \"simply\", \"i.e.\", uniformly. The rejection of the past use of \"tu\" by white French missionaries to address Africans may be a factor in the contemporary francophone usage.\n\nTitles, such as Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., Rev., etc., are often avoided by many Friends. Instead Friends tend to address each other by first and last name with no title. In many Quaker communities children address adults by either their first names, or first and last names but with no title, and in many Quaker schools teachers are called by their first names as well. It is conventional for Friends who do not know each other well, who in non-Quaker circles would address each other with a title, to use first name and last name together, rather than to adopt the more familiar first name only. Friends also tend not to use the appellation \"sir\" or \"madam\" to refer to someone of whom they do not know the name, instead using the term \"Friend\". In letter-writing, where others might use the phrase \"Dear Sir or Madam\", many Quakers would instead write \"Dear Friend\", and in such letters, rather than finishing \"yours faithfully\" would finish either \"yours in truth\" or \"yours in friendship\".\nThis practice is now considered more a part of the Testimony of Equality than a part of the Testimony of Simplicity.\n\nAdditionally early Friends and modern Friends do not swear oaths, even in courtrooms (a choice that has been allowed in Britain since 1695, and is protected in the United States by the Constitution, and one that can be problematic elsewhere). When required, Quakers may instead \"affirm\" that they are going to tell the truth. This was considered an aspect of simplicity because it was simply telling the truth rather than embellishing it with an oath, which is not necessary if one is supposed to always tell the truth. It is also an aspect of the Testimony of Integrity. It comes in part from Christ's teaching in the sermon on the mount:\n\nIn a similar manner Friends avoid haggling over prices. They simply set a fixed price that they considered fair, which went against the custom of earlier times, but was felt by them to be simpler and more honest (this practice is generally considered more a part of the Testimony of Integrity than a part of the Testimony of Simplicity).\n\nThe Testimony of Simplicity is an important part of Quaker life, and many examples of its influence can be seen in both day-to-day and ceremonious practices. In keeping with the testimony, for example, many meetings that have care of a graveyard ask that those erecting monuments to deceased Friends keep the testimony in mind and erect only a simple, low-lying stone.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1923764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923764", "title": "Bioarchaeology", "text": "Bioarchaeology\n\nThe term bioarchaeology was first coined by British archaeologist Grahame Clark in 1972 as a reference to zooarchaeology, or the study of animal bones from archaeological sites. Redefined in 1977 by Jane Buikstra, bioarchaeology in the United States now refers to the scientific study of human remains from archaeological sites, a discipline known in other countries as osteoarchaeology or palaeo-osteology. In England and other European countries, the term 'bioarchaeology' is borrowed to cover all biological remains from sites.\n\nBioarchaeology was largely born from the practices of New Archaeology, which developed in the United States in the 1970s as a reaction to a mainly cultural-historical approach to understanding the past. Proponents of New Archaeology advocated using processual methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between culture and biology, or a biocultural approach. Some archaeologists advocate a more holistic approach to bioarchaeology that incorporates critical theory and is more relevant to modern descent populations.\n\nIf possible, human remains from archaeological sites are analyzed to determine sex, age, and health.\n\nBioarchaeologists sometimes create life tables, a type of cohort analysis, to understand the demographic characteristics (such as risk of death or sex ratio) of a given age cohort within a population. Age and sex are crucial variables in the construction of a life table, although this information is often not available to bioarchaeologists. Therefore, it is often necessary to estimate the age and sex of individuals based on specific morphological characteristics of the skeleton.\n\nThe estimation of age in bioarchaeology and osteology actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed using a variety of skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or long bone length. In adults, degenerative changes to the pubic symphysis, the auricular surface of the ilium, the sternal end of the 4th rib, and dental attrition are commonly used to estimate skeletal age.\n\nDifferences in male and female skeletal anatomy are used by bioarchaeologists to determine the biological sex of human skeletons. Humans are sexually dimorphic, although overlap in body shape and sexual characteristics is possible. Not all skeletons can be assigned a sex, and some may be wrongly identified as male or female. Sexing skeletons is based on the observation that biological males and biological females differ most in the skull and pelvis; bioarchaeologists focus on these parts of the body when determining sex, although other body parts can also be used. The female pelvis is generally broader than the male pelvis, and the angle between the two inferior pubic rami (the sub-pubic angle) is wider and more U-shaped, while the sub-pubic angle of the male is more V-shaped and less than 90 degrees. Phenice details numerous visual differences between the male and female pelvis.\n\nIn general, the male skeleton is more robust than the female skeleton because of the greater muscles mass of the male. Males generally have more pronounced brow ridges, nuchal crests, and mastoid processes. It should be remembered that skeletal size and robustness are influenced by nutrition and activity levels. Pelvic and cranial features are considered to be more reliable indicators of biological sex. Sexing skeletons of young people who have not completed puberty is more difficult and problematic than sexing adults, because the body has not had time to develop fully.\n\nBioarchaeological sexing of skeletons is not error-proof. In reviewing the sexing of Egyptian skulls from Qua and Badari, Mann found that 20.3% could be assigned to a different sex than the sex indicated in the archaeological literature. A re-evalutaion of Mann's work showed that he did not understand the tomb numbering system of the old excavation and assigned wrong tomb numbers to the skulls. The sexing of the bone material was actually quite correct. However, recording errors and re-arranging of human remains may play a part in this great incidence of misidentification.\n\nDirect testing of bioarchaeological methods for sexing skeletons by comparing gendered names on coffin plates from the crypt at Christ Church, Spitalfields, London to the associated remains resulted in a 98 percent success rate.\n\nSex-based differences are not inherently a form of inequality, but become an inequality when members of one sex are given privileges based on their sex. This stems from society investing differences with cultural and social meaning. Gendered work patterns may make their marks on the bones and be identifiable in the archaeological record. Molleson found evidence of gendered work patterns by noting extremely arthritic big toes, a collapse of the last dorsal vertebrae, and muscular arms and legs among female skeletons at Abu Hureyra. She interpreted this sex-based pattern of skeletal difference as indicative of gendered work patterns. These kinds of skeletal changes could have resulted from women spending long periods of time kneeling while grinding grain with the toes curled forward. Investigation of gender from mortuary remains is of growing interest to archaeologists.\n\nEnamel hypoplasia refers to transverse furrows or pits that form in the enamel surface of teeth when the normal process of tooth growth stops, resulting in a deficit of enamel. Enamel hypoplasias generally form due to disease and/or poor nutrition. Linear furrows are commonly referred to as linear enamel hypoplasias (LEHs); LEHs can range in size from microscopic to visible to the naked eye. By examining the spacing of perikymata grooves (horizontal growth lines), the duration of the stressor can be estimated, although Mays argues that the width of the hypoplasia bears only an indirect relationship to the duration of the stressor.\n\nStudies of dental enamel hypoplasia are used to study child health. Unlike bone, teeth are not remodeled, so they can provide a more reliable indicator of past health events as long as the enamel remains intact. Dental hypoplasias provide an indicator of health status during the time in childhood when the enamel of the tooth crown is being formed. Not all of the enamel layers are visible on the surface of the tooth because enamel layers that are formed early in crown development are buried by later layers. Hypoplasias on this part of the tooth do not show on the surface of the tooth. Because of this buried enamel, teeth record stressors form a few months after the start of the event. The proportion of enamel crown formation time represented by this buried in enamel varies from up to 50 percent in molars to 15-20 percent in anterior teeth. Surface hypoplasias record stressors occurring from about one to seven years, or up to 13 years if the third molar is included.\n\nIt was long assumed that iron deficiency anemia has marked effects on the flat bones of the cranium of infants and young children. That as the body attempts to compensate for low iron levels by increasing red blood cell production in the young, sieve-like lesions develop in the cranial vaults (termed porotic hyperostosis) and/or the orbits (termed cribra orbitalia). This bone is spongy and soft.\n\nIt is however, highly unlikely that iron deficiency anemia is a cause of either porotic hyperostosis or cribra orbitalia. These are more likely the result of vascular activity in these areas and are unlikely to be pathological. The development of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis could also be attributed to other causes besides an iron deficiency in the diet, such as nutrients lost to intestinal parasites. However, dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause.\n\nAnemia incidence may be a result of inequalities within society, and/or indicative of different work patterns and activities among different groups within society. A study of iron-deficiency among early Mongolian nomads showed that although overall rates of cribra orbitalia declined from 28.7 percent (27.8 percent of the total female population, 28.4 percent of the total male population, 75 percent of the total juvenile population) during the Bronze and Iron Ages, to 15.5 percent during the Hunnu (2209–1907 BP) period, the rate of females with cribra orbitalia remained roughly the same, while the incidence of cribra orbitalia among males and children declined (29.4 percent of the total female population, 5.3 percent of the total male population, and 25 percent of the juvenile population had cribra orbitalia). Bazarsad posits several reasons for this distribution of cribra orbitalia: adults may have lower rates of cribra orbitalia than juveniles because lesions either heal with age or lead to death. Higher rates of cribia orbitalia among females may indicate lesser health status, or greater survival of young females with cribia orbitalia into adulthood.\n\nHarris lines form before adulthood, when bone growth is temporarily halted or slowed down due to some sort of stress (either disease or malnutrition). During this time, bone mineralization continues, but growth does not, or does so at very reduced levels. If and when the stressor is overcome, bone growth will resume, resulting in a line of increased mineral density that will be visible in a radiograph. If there is not recovery from the stressor, no line will be formed.\n\nThe stress hormone cortisol is deposited in hair as it grows. This has been used successfully to detect fluctuating levels of stress in the later lifespan of mummies.\n\nExamining the effects that activities and workload has upon the skeleton allows the archaeologist to examine who was doing what kinds of labor, and how activities were structured within society. The division of labor within the household may be divided according to gender and age, or be based on other hierarchical social structures. Human remains can allow archaeologists to uncover patterns in the division of labor.\n\nLiving bones are subject to Wolff's law, which states that bones are physically affected and remodeled by physical activity or inactivity. Increases in mechanical stress tend to produce bones that are thicker and stronger. Disruptions in homeostasis caused by nutritional deficiency or disease or profound inactivity/disuse/disability can lead to bone loss. While the acquisition of bipedal locomotion and body mass appear to determine the size and shape of children's bones, activity during the adolescent growth period seems to exert a greater influence on the size and shape of adult bones than exercise later in life.\n\nMuscle attachment sites (also called entheses) have been thought to be impacted in the same way causing what were once called musculoskeletal stress markers, but now widely named entheseal changes. These changes were widely used to study activity-patterns, but research has shown that processes associated with aging have a greater impact than occupational stresses. It has also been shown that geometric changes to bone structure (described above) and entheseal changes differ in their underlying cause with the latter poorly affected by occupation. Joint changes, including osteoarthritis, have also been used to infer occupations but in general these are also manifestations of the aging process.\n\nMarkers of occupational stress, which include morphological changes to the skeleton and dentition as well as joint changes at specific locations have also been widely used to infer specific (rather than general) activities. Such markers are often based on single cases described in clinical literature in the late nineteenth century. One such marker has been found to be a reliable indicator of lifestyle: the external auditory exostosis also called surfer's ear, which is a small bony protuberance in the ear canal which occurs in those working in proximity to cold water.\n\nOne example of how these changes have been used to study activities is the New York African Burial Ground in New York. This provides evidence of the brutal working conditions under which the enslaved labored; osteoarthritis of the vertebrae was very common, even among the young. The pattern of osteoarthritis combined with the early age of onset provides evidence of labor that resulted in mechanical strain to the neck. One male skeleton shows stress lesions at 37 percent of 33 muscle or ligament attachments, showing he experienced significant musculoskeletal stress. Overall, the interred show signs of significant musculoskeletal stress and heavy workloads, although workload and activities varied among different individuals. Some individuals show high levels of stress, while others do not. This references the variety of types of labor (e.g., domestic vs. carrying heavy loads) labor that enslaved individuals were forced to perform.\n\nFractures to bones during or after excavation will appear relatively fresh, with broken surfaces appearing white and unweathered. Distinguishing between fractures around the time of death and post-depositional fractures in bone is difficult, as both types of fractures will show signs of weathering. Unless evidence of bone healing or other factors are present, researchers may choose to regard all weathered fractures as post-depositional.\n\nEvidence of perimortal fractures (or fractures inflicted on a fresh corpse) can be distinguished in unhealed metal blade injuries to the bones. Living or freshly dead bones are somewhat resilient, so metal blade injuries to bone will generate a linear cut with relatively clean edges rather than irregular shattering. Archaeologists have tried using the microscopic parallel scratch marks on cut bones in order to estimate the trajectory of the blade that caused the injury.\n\nDental caries, commonly referred to as cavities or tooth decay, are caused by localized destruction of tooth enamel, as a result of acids produced by bacteria feeding upon and fermenting carbohydrates in the mouth. Subsistence based upon agriculture is strongly associated with a higher rate of caries than subsistence based upon foraging, because of the higher levels of carbohydrates in diets based upon agriculture. For example, bioarchaeologists have used caries in skeletons to correlate a diet of rice and agriculture with the disease. Females may be more vulnerable to caries compared to men, due to lower saliva flow than males, the positive correlation of estrogens with increased caries rates, and because of physiological changes associated with pregnancy, such as suppression of the immune system and a possible concomitant decrease in antimicrobial activity in the oral cavity.\n\nStable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in human bone collagen allows bioarchaeologists to carry out dietary reconstruction and to make nutritional inferences. These chemical signatures reflect long-term dietary patterns, rather than a single meal or feast. Stable isotope analysis monitors the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 (C/C), which is expressed as parts per mil (per thousand) using delta notation (δC). The ratio of carbon isotopes varies according to the types of plants consumed with different photosynthesis pathways. The three photosynthesis pathways are C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and Crassulacean acid metabolism. C4 plants are mainly grasses from tropical and subtropical regions, and are adapted to higher levels of radiation than C3 plants. Corn, millet and sugar cane are some well-known C4 domesticates, while all trees and shrubs use the C3 pathway. C3 plants are more common and numerous than C4 plants. Both types of plants occur in tropical areas, but only C3 plants occur naturally in colder areas. C and C occur in a ratio of approximately 98.9 to 1.1.\n\nThe C and C ratio is either depleted (more negative) or enriched (more positive) relative to the international standard, which is set to an arbitrary zero. The different photosynthesis pathways used by C3 and C4 plants cause them to discriminate differently towards C The C4 and C3 plants have distinctly different ranges of C; C4 plants range between -9 and -16 per mil, and C3 plants range between -22 to -34 per mil. δC studies have been used in North America to document the transition from a C3 to a C4 (native North American plants to corn) diet. The rapid and dramatic increase in C after the adoption of maize agriculture attests to the change in the southeastern American diet by 1300 CE.\n\nIsotope ratios in food, especially plant food, are directly and predictably reflected in bone chemistry, allowing researchers to partially reconstruct recent diet using stable isotopes as tracers.\nNitrogen isotopes (N and N) have been used to estimate the relative contributions of legumes verses nonlegumes, as well as terrestrial versus marine resources to the diet.\nThe increased consumption of legumes, or animals that eat them, causes N in the body to decrease. Nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen are ultimately derived from dietary protein, while carbon can be contributed by protein, carbohydrate, or fat in the diet. Compared to other plants, legumes have lower N/N ratios because they can fix molecular nitrogen, rather than having to rely on nitrates and nitrites in the soil. Legumes have δN values close to 0%, while other plants, which have δ15N values that range from 2 to 6%. Nitrogen isotope ratios can be used to index the importance of animal protein in the diet. N increases about 3-4% with each trophic step upward. N values increase with meat consumption, and decrease with legume consumption. The N/N ratio could be used to gauge the contribution of meat and legumes to the diet.\n\nSkeletons excavated from the Coburn Street Burial Ground (1750 to 1827 CE) in Cape Town, South Africa, were analyzed using stable isotope data by Cox \"et al.\" in order to determine geographical histories and life histories of the interred. The people buried in this cemetery were assumed to be slaves and members of the underclass based on the informal nature of the cemetery; biomechanical stress analysis and stable isotope analysis, combined with other archaeological data, seem to support this supposition.\n\nBased on stable isotope levels, eight Cobern Street Burial Ground individuals consumed a diet based on C4 (tropical) plants in childhood, then consumed more C3 plants, which were more common at the Cape later in their lives. Six of these individuals had dental modifications similar to those carried out by peoples inhabiting tropical areas known to be targeted by slavers who brought enslaved individuals from other parts of Africa to the colony. Based on this evidence, Cox \"et al\". argue that these individuals represent enslaved persons from areas of Africa where C4 plants are consumed and who were brought to the Cape as laborers. Cox \"et al\". do not assign these individuals to a specific ethnicity, but do point out that similar dental modifications are carried out by the Makua, Yao, and Marav peoples. Four individuals were buried with no grave goods, in accordance with Muslim tradition, facing Signal Hill, which is a point of significance for local Muslims. Their isotopic signatures indicate that they grew up in a temperate environment consuming mostly C3 plants, but some C4 plants. Many of the isotopic signatures of interred individuals indicate that they Cox \"et al\". argue that these individuals were from the Indian Ocean area. They also suggest that these individuals were Muslims. Cox \"et al\". argue that stable isotopic analysis of burials, combined with historical and archaeological data can be an effective way in of investigating the worldwide migrations forced by the African Slave Trade, as well as the emergence of the underclass and working class in the colonial Old World.\n\nStable isotope analysis of strontium and oxygen can also be carried out. The amounts of these isotopes vary in different geological locations. Because bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled over time, and because different parts of the skeleton are laid down at particular times over the course of a human life, stable isotope analysis can be used to investigate population movements in the past and indicate where people lived at various points of their lives.\n\naDNA analysis of past populations is used by archaeology to genetically determine the sex of individuals, determine genetic relatedness, understand marriage patterns, and investigate prehistoric population movements.\n\nAspects of the relationship between the physical body and socio-cultural conditions and practices can be recognized through the study of human remains. This is most often emphasized in a \"biocultural bioarchaeology\" model. It has often been the case that bioarchaeology has been regarded as a positivist, science-based discipline, while theories of the living body in the social sciences have been viewed as constructivist in nature. Physical anthropology and bioarchaeology have been criticized for having little to no concern for culture or history. Blakey has argued that scientific or forensic treatments of human remains from archaeological sites construct a view of the past that is neither cultural nor historic, and has suggested that a biocultural version of bioarchaeology will be able to construct a more meaningful and nuanced history that is more relevant to modern populations, especially descent populations. By biocultural, Blakey means a type of bioarchaeology that is not simply descriptive, but combines the standard forensic techniques of describing stature, sex and age with investigations of demography and epidemiology in order to verify or critique socioeconomic conditions experienced by human communities of the past. The incorporation of analysis regarding the grave goods interred with individuals may further the understanding of the daily activities experienced in life.\n\nCurrently, some bioarchaeologists are coming to view the discipline as lying at a crucial interface between the science and the humanities; as the human body is non-static, and is constantly being made and re-made by both biological and cultural factors.\n\nBuikstra considers her work to be aligned with Blakey's biocultural version of bioarchaeology because of her emphasis on models stemming from critical theory and political economy. She acknowledges that scholars such as Larsen are productive, but points out that his is a different type of bioarchaeology that focuses on quality of life, lifestyle, behavior, biological relatedness, and population history. It does not closely link skeletal remains to their archaeological context, and is best viewed as a \"skeletal biology of the past.\"\n\nInequalities exist in all human societies, even so-called “egalitarian” ones. It is important to note that bioarchaeology has helped to dispel the idea that life for foragers of the past was “nasty, brutish and short”; bioarchaeological studies have shown that foragers of the past were often quite healthy, while agricultural societies tend to have increased incidence of malnutrition and disease. However, based on a comparison of foragers from Oakhurst to agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe, Steyn believes that agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe were not subject to the lower nutritional levels expected for this type of subsistence system.\nDanforth argues that more “complex” state-level societies display greater health differences between elites and the rest of society, with elites having the advantage, and that this disparity increases as societies become more unequal. Some status differences in society do not necessarily mean radically different nutritional levels; Powell did not find evidence of great nutritional differences between elites and commoners, but did find lower rates of anemia among elites in Moundville.\n\nAn area of increasing interest among bioarchaeologists interested in understanding inequality is the study of violence. Researchers analyzing traumatic injuries on human remains have shown that a person's social status and gender can have a significant impact on their exposure to violence. There are numerous researchers studying violence, exploring a range of different types of violent behavior among past human societies. Including intimate partner violence, child abuse, institutional abuse, torture, warfare, human sacrifice, and structural violence.\n\nThere are ethical issues with bioarchaeology that revolve around treatment and respect for the dead. Large-scale skeletal collections were first amassed in the US in the 19th century, largely from the remains of Native Americans. No permission was ever granted from surviving family for study and display. Recently, federal laws such as NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) have allowed Native Americans to regain control over the skeletal remains of their ancestors and associated artifacts in order to reassert their cultural identities.\n\nNAGPRA passed in 1990. At this time, many archaeologists underestimated the public perception of archaeologists as non-productive members of society and grave robbers. Concerns about occasional mistreatment of Native American remains are not unfounded: in a Minnesota excavation 1971, White and Native American remains were treated differently; remains of White people were reburied, while remains of Native American people were placed in cardboard boxes and placed in a natural history museum. Blakey relates the growth in African American bioarchaeology to NAGPRA and its effect of cutting physical anthropologist off from their study of Native American remains.\n\nBioarchaeology in Europe is not as affected by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered. However, because much of European archaeology has been focused on classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe is a different story, as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in classical archaeology.\n\n\n\nOrganizations\n\nJournals\n\nOther\n"}

He was the son of Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk and Catherine Brockholes. Howard was known for actively participating in the Tory party as part of the support for King George III. He also spent a considerable amount of his money rebuilding and refurbishing Arundel Castle after inheriting his title and lands.\n\nHe married, firstly, Marion Coppinger (daughter of John Coppinger), on 1 August 1767, who died a year later giving birth. He married, secondly, Frances Scudamore (1750–1820), the only child of Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore and his wife Frances, formerly Duchess of Beaufort, on 6 April 1771 at London, England. Frances soon became insane after her marriage and was locked away until her death in 1820. Howard then lived with several mistresses. His longtime mistress, Mary Ann Gibbon (a cousin of Edward Gibbon), was reputed to be his secret third wife and she had five children by him, including two sons who were officers of arms, Matthew Howard-Gibbon, and Edward Howard-Gibbon. An older illegitimate son by a previous mistress, Sir William Woods, later became Garter King of Arms.\n\nNorfolk renounced his Catholicism to start his political life, but remained a staunch supporter of Catholic Emancipation, as well as opposing the war with the American colonies. \nHe sat in Parliament from 1780 to 1784 and became a lord of the treasury in the Portland cabinet in 1783. He succeeded to the title of 11th Duke of Norfolk in 1786 upon the death of his father. Eventually he was dismissed from the lord lieutenancy of the West Riding in 1798 for toasting the \"sovereign English people\" in terms displeasing to George III. He was known as the \"Architectural Duke\" for setting in motion the rebuilding of Arundel Castle, after over one hundred years of neglect, in the regency style. The 15th Duke disliked the 11th Duke's style but left his Library, which is regarded as the best room in the Castle.\n\nNorfolk wrote \"Historical Anecdotes of some of the Howard Family\" (1769 and 1817). He was a good friend of Sir Bysshe Shelley, allowing him in 1786 to make out the patent for his baronetcy. Shelley was influenced by Norfolk and built the flamboyant Castle Goring, one side of which was a partial copy of Norfolk's residence of Arundel Castle.\n\nNorfolk died on 16 December 1815 at age 69, without issue from either of his two legal marriages. Upon his death, his lands and titles passed to his cousin, Bernard.\n\n\n"}

It is the study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places. Population geography involves demography in a geographical perspective. It focuses on the characteristics of population distributions that change in a spatial context. This often involves factors such as where populations are found and how the size and composition of these populations is regulated by the demographic processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. Contributions to population geography are cross-disciplinary because geographical epistemologies related to environment, place and space have been developed at various times. Related disciplines include geography, demography, sociology, and economics.\nSince its inception, population geography has taken at least three distinct but related forms, the most recent of which appears increasingly integrated with human geography in general. The earliest and most enduring form of population geography emerged in the 1950s, as part of spatial science. Pioneered by Glenn Trewartha, Wilbur Zelinsky, William A. V. Clark, and others in the United States, as well as Jacqueline Beujeau-Garnier and Pierre George in France, it focused on the systematic study of the distribution of population as a whole and the spatial variation in population characteristics such as fertility and mortality.\nPopulation geography defined itself as the systematic study of:\n\n\nAccordingly, it categorized populations as groups synonymous with political jurisdictions representing gender, religion, age, disability, generation, sexuality, and race, variables which go beyond the vital statistics of births, deaths, and marriages. Given the rapidly growing global population as well as the baby boom in affluent countries such as the United States, these geographers studied the relation between demographic growth, displacement, and access to resources at an international scale.\n\nExamples can be shown through population density maps. A few types of maps that show the spatial layout of population are choropleth, isoline, and dot maps.\n\n\nResearch topics of other geographic sub-disciplines, such as settlement geography, also have a population geography dimension:\n\n\nAll of the above are looked at over space and time. Population geography also studies human-environment interactions, including problems from those relationships, such as overpopulation, pollution, and others..\n\n\n"}

This title or a form of it is awarded by the nation's government to a person who is regarded as a national treasure while still alive. The title is also known as Living National Treasure. \n\nIn 1950, the government of Japan began to designate certain individuals or groups who embodied intangible national cultural values as living human treasures. This was supplementary to buildings or places of great cultural and historical value that were designated as national treasures. Living Human Treasures thus became eligible for special protection and government support. Some of the ancient protected crafts initially were pottery, music, handmade paper, dolls, and swordmaking, but have been expanded to also include song, dance, cuisine, and other categories.\n\nSeveral countries have followed suit with their own official programmes of recognition for intangible cultural values and the people who embody them, including France, Philippines, Romania, South Korea and Thailand.\n\nIn 1993, the government of South Korea proposed to the UNESCO Executive Board the establishment of a codified \"Living Human Treasures\" program for all member states. The board adopted a decision and invited member states to establish and promote such national systems. Through its Intangible Cultural Heritage section, UNESCO introduced definitions and guidelines for supporting such living human treasure programmes.\n\nThe member states at the 32nd UNESCO General Conference in October 2003 agreed to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. The definitions of what a Living Human Treasure constitute are:\n\n(i) are persons who possess to a very high degree the knowledge and skills required for performing or re‐creating specific elements of the intangible cultural heritage. Each Member State should choose an appropriate title to designate the bearers of knowledge and skills, the title of \"Living Human Treasures\" proposed by UNESCO being indicative.

{"id": "1923817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923817", "title": "Behavioral geography", "text": "Behavioral geography\n\nBehavioral geography is an approach to human geography that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach. Behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. In addition, behavioral geography is an ideology/approach in human geography that makes use of the methods and assumptions of behaviorism to determine the cognitive processes involved in an individual's perception of or response and reaction to their environment.\n\nBehavioral geography is that branch of human science, which deals with the study of cognitive processes with its response to its environment, through behaviorism.\n\nBecause of the name it is often assumed to have its roots in behaviorism. While some behavioral geographers clearly have roots in behaviorism due to the emphasis on cognition, most can be seen as cognitively oriented. Indeed, it seems that behaviorism interest is more recent and growing. This is particularly true in the area of human landscaping.\n\nBehavioral geography draws from early behaviorist works such as Tolman's concepts of \"cognitive maps\". More cognitively oriented, behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.\n\nThe cognitive processes include environmental perception and cognition, wayfinding, the construction of cognitive maps, place attachment, the development of attitudes about space and place, decisions and behavior based on imperfect knowledge of one's environs, and numerous other topics.\n\nThe approach adopted in behavioral geography is closely related to that of psychology, but draws on research findings from a multitude of other disciplines including economics, sociology, anthropology, transportation planning, and many others.\n\nNature is the world which surrounds us, including all life (plants, animals, organisms, humans, etc.) and physical features. Social Construction is the way that human beings process the world around us in our minds. According to Plato's 'Classical Theory of Categorization', humans create categories of what they see through experience and imagination. Social constructionism, therefore, is this characterization that makes language and semantics possible. If these experiences and imageries are not placed into categories, then the human ability to think about it becomes limited.\n\nThe social construction of nature looks to question different truths and understandings for how people treat nature, based on when and where someone lives. In academic circles, researchers look at how truths exist (ontology) and how truths are justified (epistemology). Construction is both a process and an outcome, where people's understandings of the word nature can be both literal and metaphorical, such as through giving it a human quality (Mother Nature). It can also be used to discredit science or philosophy.\n\nAs a subset of behavioral geography, the social construction of nature also includes environmental ethics and values, which affect how humans treat, and interact with, the natural environment. It incorporates ideas from environmental science, ecology, sociology, geography, biology, theology, philosophy, psychology, politics, economics, and other disciplines, to bring together the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of life. Social constructionism uses a lot of ideas from Western world thinking, but it is also incorporates truths from other world views, such as the Traditional Knowledge of Aboriginal groups, or more specifically ecofeminism and cosmology in India or ubuntu philosophy in Africa, for example. It is also related to postmodernism and the concept of the Anthropocene, that views humans as a force that is redirecting the geological history of Earth, destroying nature.\n\nThere are many ways of understanding and interpreting nature. According to Raymond Williams, there are three ways to give meaning to (or define) nature:\nAccording to Raymond Williams, language plays a role in how we understand, interpret, and give meaning to nature. This is how multiple truths can be valid at the same time.\n\nHumans have the ability to create images of their environments through experiences in their mind. These experiences allow us to create mental maps where we can create memories associated to space. It is a two-way process where the environment provides suggestions for what should be seen, and then the observer gives meaning with those suggestions.\n\nThese images have three parts:\nAccording to Kevin Lynch, the environmental images (or mental maps) that we make can either be weak or strong, where the process is ongoing and never stops.\n\nScience occurs at many dimensions and scales that do not consider culture, but can be motivated by politics, economics and ethics. Scientific knowledge consists of concepts and analysis, and is a way to represent nature.\n\nAccording to Michel Foucault, a truth does not have to be close to reality for it to be worth something or have power. For Carolyn Merchant, science can only be given power if a truth is interpreted as having worth.\n\nRelativism is important in the social construction of nature, as all truths are relative to the perspective they are coming from. There are two schools of thought on how the social construction of nature is relative:\nCritical realists reject the idea of relativism and rely more on natural sciences. Pragmatists have no set opinion on the matter and rely on social science and ethics, instead.\n\nAccording to Richard Rorty, relativism is relevant to pragmatism in three ways:\nAccording to Gilbert White, pragmatism has four main assumptions:\nRichard Rorty also associated three characteristics to pragmatism:\nBeing pragmatic is the more accepted school of thought for social construction being a relative concept.\n\n\n\nNature can be socially constructed by both culturally interpreting and physically shaping the environment. This can happen in three ways:\nConstructions can also be categorized by giving them meaning through the process of embodiment, which has three components:\nNo matter how nature becomes socially constructed, though, the process itself is limited by three dimensions:\nThe physical dimension is limited to the human body, where the brain is responsible for creating and selecting thoughts. The mental dimension is used to understand the physical dimension and is limited to human logic. The social dimension needs moral and social order and is used to give meaning to both what is physically present and what is culturally constructed. All three dimensions must be present and linked to be able to socially construct nature.\n\nThe social construction of nature has room for improvement in four main areas:\n\n"}

He was the head of the Jewish Law Institute of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nElon served as a justice of the Israeli Supreme Court from 1977–1993, and as its Deputy President from 1988–1993. In 1983, he was a candidate for the President of the State of Israel.\n\nMenachem Fetter (later Elon) was born in Düsseldorf, Germany, into a religious Jewish family from Hasidic backgrounds. Elon's family fled to the Netherlands a year before Nazism's ascent in Germany. In 1935, Elon's family immigrated to Palestine. In 1938, he studied Halakha (traditional Jewish law) in the Hebron Yeshiva, and was ordained as a rabbi by chief rabbis Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. He was among the founders of a yeshiva high school Midrashiat Noam in Pardes Hanna, and served for two years as a teacher there, and became one of the founders of the religious Kibbutz Tirat Zvi in the Beit She'an Valley.\n\nThe Elon family, a member of the religious Zionist elite, is entrenched in the world of law, politics, Literature, and Halakha (Jewish religious law). In 1949, Menachem Elon married Ruth Buchsbaum, the daughter of Dr. Mordechai Buchsbaum, an Orthodox Jewish attorney and a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem. Amongst Elon's five children are Rabbi Binyamin Elon (married to writer Emuna Elon), a former member of Knesset and cabinet minister (Minister of Tourism, 2001–2004); Rabbi Mordechai Elon, the former head of Yeshivat HaKotel; Joseph (\"Sefi\") Elon, a district judge in Be'er Sheva and temporary judge of the Supreme Court of Israel (2007–2009); and Ari Elon, who is secular and a lecturer on the Bible.\n\nElon earned his diploma from the Tel Aviv School of Law and Economics in 1948. In the early 1950s, he worked as an attorney in private practice, while at the same time completing an MA in Talmud, Jewish history, and philosophy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1962, he received his doctorate. In 1955, he began a parallel career as a lecturer in Hebrew law at Hebrew University, and was subsequently appointed teaching associate, senior lecturer, associate professor, and, in 1972, Professor of Jewish Law. He also served as a guest lecturer at the Faculty of Law at Oxford University, University College of London, McGill University, and University of Pennsylvania, and as a visiting professor at Harvard University School of Law and at New York University School of Law.\n\nIn 1963, Elon was appointed head of the Institute for Research in Jewish Law at the Hebrew University, where he edited 10 volumes of The Annual of the Institute for Research in Jewish Law, as well as a digest of the response of the medieval authorities. From 1968 to 1971, he served as editor of the Division of Jewish Law of the Encyclopedia Judaica, and served as the editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica.\n\nHe played a pivotal role in the Mishpat Ivri (Hebrew Law) movement. Among his many works, he authored the foundational \"Jewish Law : History, Sources, Principles\" - a monumental, three-volume book on Hebrew law for academic use and the training of Israeli law students. In 1955, he was appointed senior assistant to the Attorney General of Israel Haim Cohn, and from 1959 to 1966, Elon served as adviser on Jewish Law to the Israel Ministry of Justice, a job which included writing legal opinions based on Jewish law regarding every law proposed in Knesset. He was a member of numerous Israeli Public Inquiry committees, and he served on committees to prepare legal proposals in various fields of civil law.\n\nIn 1979, Elon was awarded the Israel Prize for Hebrew law.\n\nIn 1977, he was appointed to the Israeli Supreme Court. Elon's rulings often drew upon the principles of Jewish law; he sought to incorporate traditional Halakha into the corpus of Israeli civil law. Elon emerged as a prominent critic of former president of the Supreme Court Aharon Barak's judicial activism.\n\nElon was involved in a number of important verdicts, including the acquittal of Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk.\n\nAmong Elon's prominent decisions were a ruling prohibiting registering the character of non-Orthodox conversions on Israeli identity cards, one ordering the return of a girl who had been transferred for adoption without her parent's consent, and the decision to order a local religious service committee to accept Leah Shakdiel as its first female member. In 1988, he ruled that active euthanasia (\"mercy killing\") was illegal, because it negated the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish state (Yael Shefer v. The State of Israel).\n\nIn 1988, he was promoted to the position of deputy president of the Supreme Court, under Meir Shamgar. He served in this position until his retirement in 1993 after 16 years as a justice; he was succeeded as deputy president by Aharon Barak.\n\nSupported by Menachem Begin and the coalition (Likud party), Elon was nearly selected as President of the State of Israel, losing in a close vote (61-57) to his childhood friend Chaim Herzog in 1983.\n\nAfter retiring from the Supreme Court in 1993, he was elected President of the World Union of Jewish Studies, and served in that capacity until 2005. In 1995, he founded and became the founding dean of Sha'arei Mishpat College for the first eight years of its existence. Elon headed a number of non-profit organizations, and sat on the boards of others. He also continued to write and teach at universities around the world. In 1992, Elon wrote the \"Jerusalem Covenant\" - a mosaic dealing with the centrality of Jerusalem in Jewish life - signed on the 25th Jerusalem Day.\n\nMenachem Elon died in Jerusalem in February 6, 2013, and was buried in Har HaMenuchot (Jerusalem).

This concept was successful, and after the opening of another branch in Rostock, the first branch in Berlin (Rosenthaler Straße) was founded in 1885.\n\nWertheim quickly realised the changing demand of the growing city in the period of industrialisation and in 1890 opened the first real \"department store\" on Moritzplatz/Oranienstraße in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The shop floor was more generous in size and permitted more elaborate presentation of products for sale, products were put on display, and longer runs allowed lower prices.\n\nHowever, it increasingly appeared that the limitations, which arose due to the shops' locations within old housing: the rooms were not especially large and made further expansion scarcely possible.\n\nGeorg Wertheim furthered his education at the Berlin Art Academy in Sonntagskursen and, with the previously unknown architect Alfred Messel, began to develop the concept of a building designed specifically for the sale of goods. The store was established in Leipzig Street in 1892, and in 1894 began the sale of goods in the first purpose planned and built department store on the Oranienstraße.\n\nThe well-known \"Wertheim Kaufhaus\" on Leipziger Platz, which was opened in 1896, went a step further. Wertheim wanted upmarket customers, who until then had held back from patronising his department stores, to have all their needs satisfied under one roof. Because of this the new building on the busiest square of the city was soon opened. In the following years, Messel had to constantly expand the building. The Wertheim store on Leipziger Platz was compared with Harrods in London and the Galeries Lafayette in Paris.\n\nOther shopping centres on Rosenthaler Straße (1903), Königsstraße (1911) and, again, on Moritzplatz (1913) followed. The Moritzplatz Wertheim store helped to finance the redirecting of the U-Bahn (Underground) (copying the model of his competitor Rudolph Karstadt) in order that customers could go directly from the underground platform to the entrance.\n\nIn 1913 the Wertheim empire was the largest German company of its kind. The success soon also aroused envy, and because most shopping complexes like Wertheim were in the hands of Jewish family companies, there were many versatile campaigns against the shopping centres. It was insinuated that they worked with false weightings, provided inferior goods, exploited employees, and demoralised customers. The Wertheim family tried to counter and work against such criticisms with special quality and security provision for their employees.\n\nIn 1933, the Jewish Wertheim family were forced to \"Arianise\" their company, i.e. to surrender their company to an \"Aryan.\" On 1 January 1937, Georg Wertheim left the business, but the Wertheim family attempted to avoid losing control of the company by making Georg's wife, Ursula, the principal shareholder since she was considered \"Aryan\" under Nazi law. The company was declared as German and renamed as the “Allgemeine Warenhandels-Gesellschaft” (General Merchandise Trading Business), or AWAG.\n\nGeorg Wertheim died on 31 December 1939 in Berlin.\nAfter the Second World War, Wertheim in 1949 was ousted from the DDR, and in 1951 in West Germany the Hertie-Konzern bought the majority of the shares and continued the business under the Wertheim name. The relatives of the family received some small compensation and relinquished all claims to the shares of the company purchased by Hertie. In 1984, Hertie acquired the rest of the Wertheim stock.\n\nFor a long time, the shop on the corner of Steglitzer Schlossstrasse and Treischkestrasse was of greatest importance. In the 1960s it was largely expanded, which led to the restructuring of a whole residential quarter (in the direction of Schildhornstrasse). In the following decades a large Karstadt-shopping centre and other shopping centres developed on the Schlossstrasse/Bornstrasse corner next to Kaufhaus Wertheim, where for a long time already had stood Kette Held’s, later Hertie’s shops.\n\nIn 1994 the only remaining Wertheim store on Kurfuerstendamm together with the Hertie business were taken into the possession of the Karstadt company.\n\nThe descendants of the Wertheim family today live in Germany and the USA, and in 2003 they initiated legal proceedings against the Karstadt company for compensations. The claim for re-transfer of ownership of the parts of the company and premises ousted in the DDR was denied by the courts in 2004. In 2005, an action brought by KarstadtQuelle was dismissed, and eventual compensation was therefore rendered more likely.\n\n\n\"This article has been translated from \"\n"}

{"id": "1923856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923856", "title": "Franklin Township, Portage County, Ohio", "text": "Franklin Township, Portage County, Ohio\n\nFranklin Township is a civil township located in Portage County, Ohio, United States. It is located along the Cuyahoga River in Northeast Ohio on the western edge of the county. The 2000 census found 5,276 people in the township and 5,527 at the 2010 Census. The township is part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Canton Combined Statistical Area.\n\nFranklin Township was originally surveyed as Town 3 Range 9 as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve and was purchased by Aaron Olmsted in 1798. It was one of the first civil townships organized in the Western Reserve and initially covered a large area. The township was named by Aaron Olmsted after his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted. It was first settled in 1805 by John Haymaker and its government structure, which consists of three township trustees, was established in 1815. Today Franklin Township is a mostly rural area largely associated with the neighboring city of Kent as the two share a common history, public school district, ZIP code, and fire department.\n\nThe area that makes up Franklin Township was originally inhabited by a number of American Indian tribes including the Mound Builders who built a burial mound in the eastern part of the township sometime during the 1st century in what would become Towners Woods Park. Captain Samuel Brady crossed the area around 1780 as part of his campaigns against an unknown tribe, escaping by leaping the Cuyahoga River in present-day downtown Kent and hiding in Brady Lake. In 1796 the area was surveyed by the Connecticut Land Company as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The original survey township was known as Town 3 Range 9 and contained and of land. Aaron Olmsted of East Hartford, Connecticut purchased this township at a cost of 12.5 cents an acre and named it for his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted. It is one of twenty-one Franklin Townships statewide. In 1802, much of the original Trumbull County, which covered the entire Western Reserve, was organized under the name of Franklin Township. The area under the Franklin Township name included all of present-day Portage County and much of present-day Summit County as well as parts of present-day Trumbull County. The following year, the township was surveyed into individual lots. At the formation of Portage County in 1807, Franklin Township included what would become Brimfield, Charlestown, Ravenna, and Rootstown townships.\n\nThe first settlers arrived in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from Warren to the banks of the Cuyahoga River. They were joined by John's brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year, and built a gristmill in 1807. Initial growth in the area was slow, but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing. The first village, known as Franklin Mills, or locally as the \"Lower Village\", developed mostly around the original Haymaker property. In 1818, Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the \"Upper Village\" that would come to be known briefly as Carthage.\n\nIn the 1820s, Franklin Township was included in the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal (P & O Canal). When construction began on the canal in the mid-1830s, land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal, including Franklin Mills. As a result, an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent. Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River, some of which either were never built or ultimately failed, due mostly to effects of the Panic of 1837. The canal officially opened in 1840, but it would be relatively short-lived, lasting into the 1860s. By 1870 the canal was completely shut down. During this time, what would become the Franklin Township Hall was constructed in 1837 as the intended home of the Franklin Silk Company. The company failed before the building was finished so the township took over the building, finished construction, and began using it for the seat of township government beginning in 1840.\n\nIn 1851, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad was built across the northern part of the township with a station at Earlville, a small settlement that once existed along present-day State Route 43 north of Kent. Though the railroad did little in terms of spurring economic development in the township, it would indirectly lead to later economic and population growth. The creation of what would become the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad under the direction of Marvin Kent began that year after Kent was upset by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad bypassing Franklin Mills. The arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western in the township in 1863 and the establishment of Franklin Mills as the site of the railroad's maintenance yards and shops the next year fueled a new spurt of prolonged economic and population growth in the village, culminating in it being renamed Kent in 1864 and formally incorporating in 1867.\n\nFranklin Township is located in west-central Portage County in Northeast Ohio approximately northeast of Akron and southeast of Cleveland. It is bordered by Kent on the south and west, Brimfield Township on the south, Stow on the west, Streetsboro and Sugar Bush Knolls to the north, Ravenna Township on the east, and the township completely surrounds the village of Brady Lake. Franklin Township also touches the city of Hudson on the northwest corner, Shalersville Township on the northeast corner, and Rootstown Township on the southeast corner. Within the boundaries of the township is the unincorporated community of Twin Lakes, a residential area on either side of State Route 43 just south of Sugar Bush Knolls. Immediately south of Twin Lakes is the location of the historical town of Earlville which existed primarily in the 19th and early 20th centuries as a stop on the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. Originally, Franklin Township covered approximately . Most of the city of Kent, all of the village of Brady Lake, and a small part of Sugar Bush Knolls occupy land that was once part of the township. Sugar Bush Knolls withdrew in 1965 and both Kent and Brady Lake formally separated from the township in 1993. Franklin Township is included in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area.\n\nLocated on the western end of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau, the topography of Franklin Township includes rolling hills and varied terrain. Lake Rockwell, the main drinking water source for the city of Akron, is in the northeastern part of the township. It was created in 1913 and impounds water from the Cuyahoga River, covering approximately . In addition to Lake Rockwell, there are seven natural kettle lakes in the township. The largest, Lake Pippen, is owned by the city of Akron as an unused part of the city's water supply. Brady Lake, which is largely within the village limits of Brady Lake, is used for recreation along with East Twin Lake and West Twin Lake, which straddle each side of State Route 43 in the northern part of the township. The United States Geological Survey lists the township's elevation at above sea level at a point inside the Kent city limits near the township's original geographic center. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2000 the township has an area of of which is land and water.\n\nFranklin Township's climate is classified as a humid continental climate in the \"Dfa\" Köppen climate classification meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons. During the spring and summer months, thunderstorms are fairly common and the area is susceptible to tornadoes. Effects from tropical systems can also be felt, usually taking the form of increased humidity, rain, and wind, such as with the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008. During the winter months, snowfall is common and can occur in large quantities with considerable cloud cover. Franklin Township is not considered part of the Lake Erie snowbelt, though lake-effect snow does occur at times. The township is in what is referred to as the \"secondary snowbelt\", meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to Lake Erie. While temperatures below the freezing point are typical in the winter months, thaw periods where temperatures exceed and even are not uncommon in January and February.\nInitial population growth in Franklin Township was influenced by the location on the Cuyahoga River which led to the development of industrial and manufacturing jobs. Early settlers mainly came from the northeastern United States and were largely of German descent.\n\nAs of the 2000 Census, there were 5,276 people, 2,174 households, and 1,325 families residing in the township. The population density was 408.8 people per square mile (157.8/km²). There were 2,275 housing units at an average density of 176.3/sq mi (109.5/km²). The racial makeup of the township was 93.7% White, 2.0% African American, 2.2% Asian, 0.2% Native American, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. 0.7% of the population is Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\nThere were 2,174 households out of which 28.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.6% were married couples living together, 6.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.5% were non-families. 27.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\nIn the township the population was spread out with 21.6% under the age of 18, 14.1% from 18 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 26.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.4 years, slightly above both the median age for Ohio (36.2) and the United States (35.3), but significantly above the median age for the city of Kent (22.9). For every 100 females there were 104.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.4 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $47,750, and the median income for a family was $64,792. This compared with Ohio's median household income of $40,956 and $41,994 for the United States. Males had a median income of $43,281 versus $27,262 for females. The per capita income for the township was $28,656. About 2.8% of families and 10.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.4% of those under age 18 and 0.5% of those age 65 or over. These are slightly below the levels for both the state and national averages, with 10.6% of individuals in Ohio and 12.4% in the United States being below the poverty line and 7.8% of families in Ohio and 9.2% in the United States.\n\nEducationally, like Kent, Franklin Township is above the national, state, and local averages for residents who have attained a bachelor's, master's, or above a master's degree. At the 2000 Census, approximately 42.9% of the township's population above the age of 25 had obtained a college degree compared to 37.1% of Kent's population, 21.0% of the population of Portage County, 21.2% statewide, and 24.4% nationally.\n\nThe location of Franklin Township along the Cuyahoga River and later the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal and multiple railroad lines made it attractive initially for the establishment of small gristmills and factories. Progressively larger factories would later develop due to increased power potential of the river and later due to the ease and lower cost of transportation of goods to other markets. During the latter half of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the township's largest employers were all industrially based, including the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and its successors, which operated its main maintenance shops in the village; the Seneca Chain Company; and bus manufacturer Twin Coach among others.\n\nChanges in the structure of the railroad and declines in the manufacturing sector during the mid-20th century combined with the rapid growth of Kent State University following World War II led to the university becoming Portage County's largest employer and influencing the development of other areas of the township's economy. Kent State University operates Centennial Research Park, along Ohio State Route 59 in the Joint Economic Development District with Kent, which houses two high tech start-up companies in the liquid crystal industry.\n\nAs of 2000, the educational, health, and social services fields were the township's largest sector, and employed approximately 29% of the workforce. 17.8% is employed in manufacturing, with 13.6% in retail. Arts and entertainment accounts for 7.9% of the workforce with 7.3% in professional and management services.\n\n86.1% of those employed commuted alone to work by way of a car, truck, or van with another 6.8% carpooling. 2.2% of workers walked to work with 0.4% using public transportation. The average commute time was approximately 20 minutes.\n\nThe township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following 1 January. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on 1 April of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees. As of 2006, the trustees are Mark Beckwith, Keith Benjamin, and Gary Falstad, and the fiscal officer is Lise Russell.\n\nAt the state level, Franklin Township is part of the 68th district of the Ohio House of Representatives, represented by Democrat Kathleen Chandler of Kent. In the State Senate, Franklin Township is part of the 28th district, represented since 2007 by Democrat Tom Sawyer of Akron. At the Federal level, the township is part of Ohio's 17th congressional district, represented by Democrat Tim Ryan of Niles.\n\nPreschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the Kent City School District with a small portion of the northwest part of the township a part of the neighboring Stow-Munroe Falls City School District. Franklin Township operated its own school district, housed at what is now the former Franklin Elementary School, until 1959 when it merged with the Kent City School District and the Brady Lake School District. In addition to serving most of Kent, Franklin Township, and the village of Brady Lake, the Kent City School District also includes the village of Sugar Bush Knolls and a small part of southern Streetsboro. The district has four neighborhood elementary schools that serve students in grades K–5, Stanton Middle School for grades 6–8, and Theodore Roosevelt High School for grades 9–12. Kent Schools also operates a preschool program housed at Davey Elementary School, and is a member of the Six District Educational Compact with five surrounding districts to facilitate vocational education with many of these programs housed at Theodore Roosevelt High School. In 1985, Theodore Roosevelt High School was given the United States Department of Education Excellence in Education award and the school has been rated \"Excellent\" by the Ohio Department of Education since 2004. In December 2009, it was named in \"US News & World Report\" as one of the best high schools in the United States, earning the publication's Bronze Medal designation. The Kent City School District has been consistently rated as \"Excellent\" or \"Effective\" by the Ohio Department of Education and in 2007 Walls Elementary School was named a \"School of Promise\" by the Ohio Department of Education, while Longcoy Elementary earned the U.S. Department of Education's prestigious Blue Ribbon School award.\n\nFranklin Township is part of the as defined by the Federal Communications Commission, which includes a 17-county region of Northeast Ohio. It currently ranks as the 18th-largest media market in the United States according to Nielsen Media Research. While most stations are located in Cleveland and Akron, Franklin Township is home to the studios for WAOH and W35AX, local affiliates for the Retro Television Network. Franklin Township is also in range of the television stations that broadcast out of Youngstown.\n\nFor radio, Franklin Township is part of the , though it is within range of major stations in the as well as many in the and markets. Two stations licensed to the city of Kent, one FM and one AM, are located in Franklin Township. WNIR, at 100.1 FM, is broadcast from studios shared with sister station WJMP and television stations WAOH and W35AX. WNIR is centered on talk radio and news and is a local affiliate of ABC Radio and Westwood One. It also the flagship station for Kent State football and men's basketball broadcasts. WJMP, which broadcasts at 1520 AM, is a daytime-only news/talk station.\n\nThe \"Record-Courier\", a daily paper based in Kent which covers news for Portage County, is the main source of printed media for Franklin Township. The \"Record-Courier\" was formed by the merger of the Ravenna \"Evening Record\" and the Kent \"Courier-Tribune\". The township is also served by Kent State University's \"Daily Kent Stater\", which is available in select locations on and off campus and online via KentWired.com, a collaborative site with TV-2 and Black Squirrel Radio. The \"Akron Beacon Journal\" and \"The Plain Dealer\" also serve Franklin Township through regional coverage and delivery.\n\nThe township provides limited services to residents including curbside recycling pickup, seasonal leaf and Christmas tree pickup, chipping and mulching, and road maintenance. Waste collection is handled individually and township residents maintain their own wells and septic systems. Portage County handles the townships's curbside recycling collection. Within the boundaries of the Joint Economic Development District with the city of Kent along State Route 59, water and sewer service is provided by Kent. Local phone utilities are provided through AT&T Ohio through the 330 and 234 area codes, electricity is supplied and lines are maintained by FirstEnergy in the former coverage area of Ohio Edison, and natural gas is supplied and lines are maintained by Dominion Resources East Ohio Energy. While residents are free to choose their own natural gas and electric suppliers, the township is part of the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council, or NOPEC, the largest government aggregation in the United States.\n\nState Route 59, Summit Road, and Brady Lake Road are the main east–west highways providing links to neighboring Kent and Ravenna while Ravenna Road connects the township with Hudson. State Route 43 is the main north–south highway with Diagonal Road a secondary road northeast to Mantua via Streetsboro. SR 43 connects Franklin Township with Interstate 76, approximately to the south via exit 33 in Brimfield and to the Ohio Turnpike/Interstate 80 and the eastern terminus of Interstate 480, approximately to the north via Turnpike exit 187 in Streetsboro. SR 43 is a two lane road in the township and widens to four and five lanes in Kent. SR 59 is a three-lane road before widening to five lanes just east of the junction with State Route 261. State Route 261 passes through the southeastern part of the township as a two-lane highway mainly running north-south before turning to an east-west direction and widening to a four-lane divided highway for a short distance in northern Brimfield Township and southern Kent. It serves as a bypass of Kent between SR 43, SR 59, and Summit Street and connects the township to Tallmadge on the southwest.\n\nPublic transportation is provided by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority, known as PARTA, which is headquartered in the township along Summit Road. PARTA serves Franklin Township through a dial-a-ride service, the seasonal Black Squirrel route along SR 59 during Kent State University's Fall and Spring semesters, and the Interurban connecting with Stow and Ravenna.\n\nHospital care is provided mainly through Robinson Memorial Hospital. The 150-bed main hospital is located in Ravenna and the system operates additional facilities throughout Portage County. The township is home to one free clinic, Portage Community Health Center, located along State Route 59 in the Joint Economic Development District with Kent.\n\nAlthough the city of Kent incorporated in 1867 and the village of Brady Lake would follow in 1927, until 1993, the U.S. Census Bureau counted most of the population of Kent and all of Brady Lake as the \"incorporated portions\" of Franklin Township. As such, the township has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields, most of whom are more associated with Kent or Brady Lake. John Davey, a pioneer in tree surgery and founder of the Davey Tree Expert Company moved to Kent/Franklin Township in the 1880s. His son, Martin L. Davey, would later serve as Governor of Ohio and a U.S. Representative. Other political figures to come from Kent/Franklin Township include Wisconsin governor Lucius Fairchild, former U.S. Representative Robert E. Cook, and noted abolitionist John Brown, who lived in the township from 1835–1839. Noted athletes to have come from Kent/Franklin Township include former National Football League players Mike Adamle, Tom DeLeone, and Stan White and former Major League Baseball player, manager, and executive Gene Michael. Professional golfer Ben Curtis, a Kent State University alumnus, has been a resident of the township since 2011. Two members of the band Devo, which debuted in Kent in 1973 and was founded by Kent State University students, are natives of Kent/Franklin Township: Peter Gregg and Rod Reisman. Other performing artists to come from Kent/Franklin Township include singer Julianne Baird, playwright Vincent J. Cardinal, and voice actor Joshua Seth. Lucien Price, an author and writer for \"The Boston Evening Transcript\" and \"The Atlantic Monthly\" grew up in the area and used the pseudonym \"Woolwick\" for Kent in some of his stories. Kent/Franklin Township was also the home of inventor Lucien B. Smith, regarded as the inventor of barbed wire. Additionally, many notable people have lived in Kent/Franklin Township while attending Kent State University, among them comedians Drew Carey and Arsenio Hall, actor Michael Keaton, musician Joe Walsh, and additional members of the band Devo. Notable athletes include football player Jack Lambert; Major League Baseball players Thurman Munson and Rich Rollins; and college football coaches Nick Saban and Lou Holtz.\n\n"}

{"id": "1923865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923865", "title": "Pappenheim (state)", "text": "Pappenheim (state)\n\nPappenheim was a German statelet in western Bavaria, Germany, located on the Altmühl river between Treuchtlingen and Solnhofen, and south of Weißenburg. As former sovereign family, later mediatized to Bavria in 1806 the family belongs to High nobility.\n\nPappenheim originated as a Lordship around 1030, and was raised to a county in 1628.\n\nThe first member of the House of Pappenheim was \"Henricus Caput\", mentioned in 1111 as vassal of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. From about 1100 until 1806 the Lords and Counts of Pappenheim held the position of hereditary marshals of the Holy Roman Empire, a court office that made them deputies of the Empire's arch marshals, the Electors of Saxony, with certain ceremonial tasks at the Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor. Being immediate to the Emperor, Pappenheim was a member of the Swabian bench of Imperial Counts with one collective vote in the Imperial Diet.\n\nPappenheim was partitioned twice: between itself, Alesheim (Aletzheim), Gräfenthal and Treuchtlingen in 1439; and between itself and Stühlingen in 1558. Pappenheim absorbed Alesheim in 1697, Gräfenthal in 1536, and Treuchtlingen in 1647. Treuchtlingen was purchased in 1447/53 and, after the Treuchtlingen branch went enxtinct in 1647, became part of the Principality of Ansbach. Stühlingen, acquired in 1582, was inherited by Fürstenberg in 1639. Pappenheim was mediatised by Bavaria in 1806. \n\nIn 1815, the Congress of Vienna recognized that Pappenheim should receive compensation for their loss of the hereditary office of Imperial marshal. The former Saar department of the First French Empire was divided five ways, with one of the portions granted to Pappenheim as sovereign territory. Shortly thereafter, the family exchanged title to their land to Prussia for a monetary payment. Pappenheim was formally recognized by Bavaria as a mediatized house in 1831, after all claims were settled. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1923870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923870", "title": "The Pirate Bay", "text": "The Pirate Bay\n\nThe Pirate Bay (sometimes abbreviated as TPB) is an online index of digital content of entertainment media and software. Founded in 2003 by Swedish think tank Piratbyrån, The Pirate Bay allows visitors to search, download, and contribute magnet links and torrent files, which facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing among users of the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nThe Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion about legal aspects of file sharing, copyright, and civil liberties and has become a platform for political initiatives against established intellectual property laws as well as a central figure in an anti-copyright movement. The website faced several shutdowns and domain seizures, switching to a series of new web addresses to continue operating.\n\nIn April 2009, the website's founders (Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, and Gottfrid Svartholm) were found guilty in the Pirate Bay trial in Sweden for assisting in copyright infringement and were sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine. In some countries, Internet service providers (ISPs) have been ordered to block access to the website. Subsequently, proxy websites have been providing access to it. Founders Svartholm, Neij, and Sunde were all released by 2015 after having served shortened sentences.\n\nThe Pirate Bay was established in September 2003 by the Swedish anti-copyright organisation Piratbyrån (The Piracy Bureau); it has been run as a separate organisation since October 2004. The Pirate Bay was first run by Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij, who are known by their nicknames \"anakata\" and \"TiAMO\", respectively. They have both been accused of \"assisting in making copyrighted content available\" by the Motion Picture Association of America. On 31 May 2006, the website's servers in Stockholm were raided and taken away by Swedish police, leading to three days of downtime. The Pirate Bay claims to be a non-profit entity based in the Seychelles; however, this is disputed.\n\nThe Pirate Bay has been involved in a number of lawsuits, both as plaintiff and as defendant. On 17 April 2009, Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Carl Lundström were found guilty of assistance to copyright infringement and sentenced to one year in prison and payment of a fine of 30 million SEK (approximately 4.2m USD, 2.8m GBP, or 3.1m EUR), after a trial of nine days. The defendants appealed the verdict and accused the judge of giving in to political pressure. On 26 November 2010, a Swedish appeals court upheld the verdict, decreasing the original prison terms but increasing the fine to 46 million SEK. On 17 May 2010, because of an injunction against their bandwidth provider, the site was taken offline. Access to the website was later restored with a message making fun of the injunction on their front page. On 23 June 2010, the group Piratbyrån disbanded due to the death of Ibi Kopimi Botani, a prominent member and co-founder of the group.\n\nThe Pirate Bay was hosted for several years by PRQ, a Sweden-based company, owned by creators of TPB Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij. PRQ is said to provide \"highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services to its customers\". From May 2011, Serious Tubes Networks started providing network connectivity to The Pirate Bay. On 23 January 2012, The Pirate Bay added the new category \"Physibles\". These are 3D files described as \"data objects that are able (and feasible) to become physical\" using a 3D printer. In May 2012, as part of Google's newly inaugurated \"Transparency Report\", the company reported over 6,000 formal requests to remove Pirate Bay links from the Google Search index; those requests covered over 80,500 URLs, with the five copyright holders having the most requests consisting of: Froytal Services LLC, Bang Bros, Takedown Piracy LLC, Amateur Teen Kingdom, and International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). On 10 August 2013, The Pirate Bay announced the release of PirateBrowser, a free web browser used to circumvent internet censorship. The site was the most visited torrent directory on the World Wide Web from 2003 until November 2014, when KickassTorrents had more visitors according to Alexa. On 8 December 2014, Google removed most of the Google Play apps from its app store that have \"The Pirate Bay\" in the title.\n\nOn 9 December 2014, The Pirate Bay was raided by the Swedish police, who seized servers, computers, and other equipment. Several other torrent related sites including EZTV, Zoink, Torrage and the Istole tracker were also shut down in addition to The Pirate Bay's forum Suprbay.org. On the second day after the raid EZTV was reported to be showing \"signs of life\" with uploads to ExtraTorrent and KickassTorrents and supporting proxy sites like eztv-proxy.net via the main website's backend IP addresses. Several copies of The Pirate Bay went online during the next several days, most notably oldpiratebay.org, created by isoHunt.\n\nOn 19 May 2015, the .se domain of The Pirate Bay was ordered to be seized following a ruling by a Swedish court. The site reacted by adding six new domains in its place. The judgment was appealed on 26 May 2015. On 12 May 2016 the appeal was\ndismissed and the Court ruled the domains be turned over to the Swedish state. The site returned to using its original .org domain in May 2016. In August 2016, the US government shut down KickassTorrents, which resulted in The Pirate Bay becoming once again the most visited BitTorrent website.\n\nThe Pirate Bay allows users to search for Magnet links. These are used to reference resources available for download via peer-to-peer networks which, when opened in a BitTorrent client, begin downloading the desired content. (Originally, The Pirate Bay allowed users to download BitTorrent files (torrents), small files that contain metadata necessary to download the data files from other users). The torrents are organised into categories: \"Audio\", \"Video\", \"Applications\", \"Games\", \"Porn\" and \"Other\". Registration requires an email address and is free; registered users may upload their own torrents and comment on torrents. According to a study of newly uploaded files during 2013 by TorrentFreak, 44% of uploads were television shows and movies, porn was in second place with 35% of uploads, and audio made up 9% of uploads.\n\nThe website features a browse function that enables users to see what is available in broad categories like Audio, Video, and Games, as well as sub-categories like Audio books, High-res Movies, and Comics. Since January 2012, it also features a \"Physibles\" category for 3D-printable objects. The contents of these categories can be sorted by file name, the number of seeders or leechers, the date posted, etc.\n\nPiratbyrån described The Pirate Bay as a long-running project of performance art. Normally, the front page of The Pirate Bay featured a drawing of a pirate ship with the logo of the 1980s anti-copyright infringement campaign, \"Home Taping Is Killing Music\", on its sails instead of the Jolly Roger symbol usually associated with pirate ships.\n\nInitially, The Pirate Bay's four Linux servers ran a custom web server called Hypercube. An old version is open-source. On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage, which was reported to be at 2 HTTP requests per millisecond on each of the four web servers, as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the front-end of the website. The website now runs Lighttpd and PHP on its dynamic front ends, MySQL at the database back end, Sphinx on the two search systems, memcached for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions and Varnish in front of Lighttpd for caching static content. , The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight BitTorrent trackers.\n\nOn 7 December 2007, The Pirate Bay finished the move from Hypercube to Opentracker as its BitTorrent tracking software, also enabling the use of the UDP tracker protocol for which Hypercube lacked support. This allowed UDP multicast to be used to synchronise the multiple servers with each other much faster than before. Opentracker is free software.\n\nIn June 2008, The Pirate Bay announced that their servers would support SSL encryption in response to Sweden's new wiretapping law. On 19 January 2009, The Pirate Bay launched IPv6 support for their tracker system, using an IPv6-only version of Opentracker. On 17 November 2009, The Pirate Bay shut off its tracker service permanently, stating that centralised trackers are no longer needed since distributed hash tables (DHT), peer exchange (PEX), and magnet links allow peers to find each other and content in a decentralised way.\n\nOn 20 February 2012, The Pirate Bay announced in a Facebook post that after 29 February the site would no longer offer torrent files, and would instead offer only magnet links. The site commented: \"Not having torrents will be a bit cheaper for us but it will also make it harder for our common enemies to stop us.\" The site added that torrents being shared by fewer than ten people will retain their torrent files, to ensure compatibility with older software that may not support magnet links.\n\nIn April 2007, a rumour was confirmed on the Swedish talk show \"Bert\" that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur Carl Lundström. This caused some consternation since Lundström, an heir to the Wasabröd fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like Sverigedemokraterna and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (\"Keep Sweden Swedish\"). During the talk show, Piratbyrån spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that \"without Lundström's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start\" and stated that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth.\n\nFrom 2004 until 2006, The Pirate Bay had a \"Donate\" link to a donations page which listed several payment methods, stated that funds supported only the tracker, and offered time-limited benefits to donors such as no advertisements and \"VIP\" status. After that, the link was removed from the home page, and the donations page only recommended donating \"to your local pro-piracy group\" for a time, after which it redirected to the site's main page. \"Billboard\" claimed that the site in 2009 \"appeals for donations to keep its service running\". In 2006, Petter Nilsson, a candidate on the Swedish political reality show \"Toppkandidaterna\" (\"The Top Candidates\"), donated 35,000 SEK (US$4,925.83) to The Pirate Bay, which they used to buy new servers.\n\nIn 2007, the site ran a fund intended to buy Sealand, a platform with debated micronation status. In 2009, the convicted principals of TPB requested that users stop trying to donate money for their fines, because they refused to pay them. In 2013, The Pirate Bay published its Bitcoin address on the site front page for donations, as well as Litecoin.\n\nThe site links to an online store selling site-related merchandise, first noted in 2006 in \"Svenska Dagbladet\".\n\nSince 2006, the website has received financing through advertisements on result pages. According to speculations by \"Svenska Dagbladet\", the advertisements generate about 600,000 SEK (US$84,000) per month. In an investigation in 2006, the police concluded that The Pirate Bay brings in 1.2 million SEK (US$169,000) per year from advertisements. The prosecution estimated in the 2009 trial from emails and screenshots that the advertisements pay over 10 million SEK (US$1.4M) a year, but the indictment used the estimate from the police investigation. The lawyers of the site's administrators counted the 2006 revenue closer to 725,000 SEK (US$102,000). The verdict of the first trial, however, quoted the estimate from the preliminary investigation.\n\n, IFPI claims that the website is extremely profitable, and that The Pirate Bay is more engaged in making profit than supporting people's rights. The website has insisted that these allegations are not true, stating, \"It's not free to operate a Web Site on this scale\", and, \"If we were making lots of money I, Svartholm, wouldn't be working late at the office tonight, I'd be sitting on a beach somewhere, working on my tan.\" In response to claims of annual revenue exceeding US$3 million made by the IFPI, the site's spokesman Peter Sunde argues that the website's high bandwidth, power, and hardware costs eliminate the potential for profit. The Pirate Bay, he says, may ultimately be operating at a loss. In the 2009 trial, the defence estimated the site's yearly expenses to be 800,000 SEK (US$110,000).\n\nThere have been unintentional advertisers. In 2007, an online ad agency placed Wal-Mart \"The Simpsons\" DVD ads \"along with search results that included downloads of the series\". In 2012, banner ads for Canada's Department of Finance Economic Action Plan were placed atop search results, as part of a larger \"media buy\", but were pulled \"quickly\".\n\nAccording to the site's usage policy, it reserves the right to charge commercial policy violators \"a basic fee of €5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation\". Co-founder Peter Sunde accused Swedish book publishers, who scraped the site for information about copyrighted books, of violating the usage policy, and asserted TPB's copyright on its database.\n\nThe team behind The Pirate Bay has worked on several websites and software projects of varying degrees of permanence. In 2007, \"BayImg\", an image hosting website similar to TinyPic went online in June. Pre-publication images posted to \"BayImg\" became part of a legal battle when Conde Nast's network was later allegedly hacked.\nIn July, \"within hours after Ingmar Bergman's death\", BergmanBits.com was launched, listing torrents for the director's films, online until mid-2008.\nIn August, The Pirate Bay relaunched the BitTorrent website Suprnova.org to perform the same functions as The Pirate Bay, with different torrent trackers, but the site languished; the domain was returned to its original owner in August 2010, and it now redirects to TorrentFreak.tv.\nSuprbay.org was introduced in August as the official forum for ThePirateBay.org and the various sites connected to it. Users can request reseeding of torrents, or report malware within torrent files or illegal material on ThePirateBay.org.\n\"BOiNK\" was announced in October in response to the raid on Oink's Pink Palace, a music-oriented BitTorrent website. A month later Sunde cancelled \"BOiNK\", citing the many new music websites created since the downfall of OiNK.\nA Mac dashboard widget was released in December, listing \"top 10 stuff currently on TPB, either per category or the full list\". \"SlopsBox\", a disposable email address anti-spam service, also appeared in December, and was reviewed in 2009.\n\nIn 2008, \"Baywords\" was launched as a free blogging service that lets users of the site blog about anything as long as it does not break any Swedish laws. In December, The Pirate Bay resurrected ShareReactor as a combined eD2k and BitTorrent site. The same month, the \"Vio\" mobile video converter was released, designed to convert video files for playback on mobile devices such as iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, many Nokia and Windows Mobile devices.\n\nIn 2009, \"Pastebay\", a note sharing service similar to Pastebin, was made available to the public as of 23 March. \"The Video Bay\" video streaming/sharing site was announced in June to be \"The YouTube Killer\", with content viewable in HTML 5-capable browsers. The site was in an \"Extreme Beta\" phase; a message on the homepage instructed the user \"don't expect anything to work at all\". \"The Video Bay\" was never completed and as of 28 April 2013, \"The Video Bay\" is inaccessible.\n\nOn 18 April 2011, Pirate Bay temporarily changed its name to \"Research Bay\", collaborating with P2P researchers of the Lund University Cybernorms group in a large poll of P2P users. The researchers published their results online on \"The Survey Bay\", as a public Creative Commons project in 2013. In January 2012, the site announced \"The Promo Bay\"; \"doodles\" by selected musicians, artists and others could be rotated onto the site's front page at a future date. Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho was promoted, offering a collection of his books for free download. By November, 10,000 artists were reported to have signed up. TPB preserves a dated collection of exhibited logos. On 2 December 2012, some ISPs in the UK such as BT, Virgin Media, and BE started blocking \"The Promo Bay\" but stopped a few days later when the BPI reversed its position.\n\nIn January 2007, when the micronation of Sealand was put up for sale, the ACFI and The Pirate Bay tried to buy it. The Sealand government, however, did not want to be involved with The Pirate Bay, as it was their opinion that file sharing represented \"theft of proprietary rights\". A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000 (€15,000) in donations for this cause.\n\nThe P2P news blog \"TorrentFreak\" reported on 12 October 2007 that the Internet domain ifpi.com, which previously belonged to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, an anti-piracy organisation, had been acquired by The Pirate Bay. When asked about how they got hold of the domain, Sunde told \"TorrentFreak\", \"It's not a hack, someone just gave us the domain name. We have no idea how they got it, but it's ours and we're keeping it.\" The website was renamed \"The International Federation of Pirates Interests\" However, the IFPI filed a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization shortly thereafter, which subsequently ordered The Pirate Bay to return the domain name to the IFPI.\n\nOn 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations. Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ. The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three peopleGottfrid Svartholm, Mikael Viborg, and Fredrik Neijwere held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening. All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities. Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) wrote in a press release: \"Since filing a criminal complaint in Sweden in November 2004, the film industry has worked vigorously with Swedish and U.S. government officials in Sweden to shut this illegal website down.\" MPAA CEO Dan Glickman also stated, \"Intellectual property theft is a problem for film industries all over the world and we are glad that the local government in Sweden has helped stop The Pirate Bay from continuing to enable rampant copyright theft on the Internet.\" The MPAA press release set forth its justification for the raid and claimed that there were three arrests; however, the individuals were not actually arrested, only held for questioning. The release also reprinted John G. Malcolm's allegation that The Pirate Bay was making money from the distribution of copyrighted material, a criticism denied by the Pirate Bay.\n\nAfter the raid, The Pirate Bay displayed a message that confirmed that the Swedish police had executed search warrants for breach of copyright law or assisting such a breach. The closure message initially caused some confusion because on 1 April 2005, April Fools' Day, The Pirate Bay had posted a similar message as a prank, stating that they were unavailable due to a raid by the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau and IFPI. Piratbyrån set up a temporary news blog to inform the public about the incident. On 2 June 2006, The Pirate Bay was available once again, with their logo depicting a pirate ship firing cannonballs at the Hollywood Sign.The Pirate Bay has servers in both Belgium and Russia for future use in case of another raid. According to The Pirate Bay, in the two years following the raid, it grew from 1 million to 2.7 million registered users and from 2.5 million to 12 million peers. The Pirate Bay now claims over 5 million active users.\n\nSweden's largest technology museum, the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology, acquired one of the confiscated servers in 2009 and exhibited it for having great symbolic value as a \"big problem or a big opportunity\".\n\nIn September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program \"Debatt\" on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate on the condition that the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.\n\n\"I don't think it's our job to judge if something is ethical or unethical or what other people want to put out on the internet\", said The Pirate Bay's spokesperson Peter Sunde to TV4.\n\nIn September 2007, a large number of internal emails were leaked from anti-piracy company MediaDefender by an anonymous hacker. Some of the leaked emails discussed hiring hackers to perform DDoS attacks on The Pirate Bay's servers and trackers. In response to the leak, The Pirate Bay filed charges in Sweden against MediaDefender clients Twentieth Century Fox Sweden AB, EMI Sweden AB, Universal Music Group Sweden AB, Universal Pictures Nordic AB, Paramount Home Entertainment (Sweden) AB, Atari Nordic AB, Activision Nordic, Ubisoft Sweden AB, Sony BMG Music Entertainment (Sweden) AB, and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Nordic AB, but the charges were not pursued. MediaDefender's stocks fell sharply after this incident, and several media companies withdrew from the service after the company announced the leak had caused $825,000 in losses.\n\nLater, The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde accused police investigator Jim Keyzer of a conflict of interest when he declined to investigate MediaDefender. Keyzer later accepted a job for MPAA member studio Warner Brothers. The leaked emails revealed that other MPAA member studios hired MediaDefender to pollute The Pirate Bay's torrent database. In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested assistance from the Swedish government to prevent The Pirate bay distributing video clips from the Beijing Olympics. The IOC claimed there were more than one million downloads of footage from the Olympics – mostly of the opening ceremony. The Pirate Bay, however, did not take anything down, and temporarily renamed the website to The Beijing Bay.\n\nThe trial against the men behind the Pirate Bay started in Sweden on 16 February 2009. They were accused of breaking Swedish copyright law.\nThe defendants, however, continued to be confident about the outcome. Half the charges against the Pirate Bay were dropped on the second day of the trial.\n\nThe three operators of the site and their one investor Carl Lundström were convicted in Stockholm district court on 17 April 2009 and sentenced to one year in jail each and a total of 30 million SEK (US$3.6 million, 2.7 million EUR, 2.4 million GBP) in fines and damages. The defendants' lawyers appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal and requested a retrial in the district court, alleging bias on the part of judge Tomas Norström.\nOn 13 May 2009, several record companies again sued Neij, Svartholm, Sunde and also The Pirate Bay's main internet service provider Black Internet. They required enforcement for ending The Pirate Bay's accessory to copyright infringement that had not stopped despite the court order in April, and in the complaint listed several pages of works being shared with the help of the site. The suit was joined by several major film companies on 30 July. The Stockholm district court ruled on 21 August that Black Internet must stop making available the specific works mentioned in the judgment, or face a 500,000 SEK fine. The company was notified of the order on 24 August, and they complied with it on the same day by disconnecting The Pirate Bay. Computer Sweden noted that the judgment did not order The Pirate Bay to be disconnected, but the ISP had no other option for stopping the activity on the site. It was the first time in Sweden for an ISP to be forced to stop providing access for a website. A public support fund fronted by the CEO of the ISP was set up to cover the legal fees of an appeal. Pirate Party leader Rickard Falkvinge submitted the case for Parliamentary Ombudsman review, criticising the court's order to make intermediaries responsible for relayed content and to assign active crime prevention tasks to a private party.\n\nOn 28 October 2009, the Stockholm District Court ordered a temporary injunction on Neij and Svartholm with a penalty of 500,000 SEK each, forbidding them from participating in the operation of The Pirate Bay's website or trackers.\n\nOn 21 May 2010, the Svea Court of Appeal decided not to change the orders on Black Internet or Neij and Svartholm.\n\nOn 1 February 2012, the Supreme Court of Sweden refused to hear an appeal in the conviction case, and agreed with the decision of the Svea Court of Appeal, which had upheld the sentences in November 2011.\n\nOn 2 September 2012, Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg was arrested in Cambodia. He was detained in Phnom Penh by officers executing an international warrant issued against him in April after he did not turn up to serve a one-year jail sentence for copyright violations. On 24 December 2012, administrators of TPB changed the homepage to urge users to send Warg, in jail, \"gifts and letters\".\n\nIn March 2013, The Pirate Bay claimed in a blog post that it had moved its servers to North Korea. The incident turned out to be a hoax. In April 2013, within a week The Pirate Bay had moved its servers from Greenland to Iceland to St. Martin, either in response to legal threats or preemptively. In December 2013, the site changed its domain to .ac (Ascension Island), following the seizure of the .sx domain. On 12 December, the site moved to .pe (Peru), on 18 December to .gy (Guyana). Following the site's suspension from the .gy domain, on 19 December The Pirate Bay returned to .se (Sweden), which it had previously occupied between February 2012 and April 2013.\n\nThe Pirate Bay trial was a joint criminal and civil prosecution in Sweden of four individuals charged for promoting the copyright infringement of others with The Pirate Bay site. The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of intellectual rights holders led by IFPI, who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay.\n\nSwedish prosecutors filed charges on 31 January 2008 against Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Peter Sunde; and Carl Lundström, a Swedish businessman who through his businesses sold services to the site. The prosecutor claimed the four worked together to administer, host, and develop the site and thereby facilitated other people's breach of copyright law. Some 34 cases of copyright infringements were originally listed, of which 21 were related to music files, 9 to movies, and 4 to games. One case involving music files was later dropped by the copyright holder who made the file available again on The Pirate Bay site. In addition, claims for damages of 117 million kronor (US$13 million, €12.5 million) were filed. The case was decided jointly by a judge and three appointed lay judges. According to Swedish media, the lead judge was involved in one pro-copyright organisation, and on the board of another, but denied that his involvement constituted a conflict of interest.\n\nThe trial started on 16 February 2009, in the district court (\"tingsrätt\") of Stockholm, Sweden. The hearings ended on 3 March 2009 and the verdict was announced at 11:00 am on Friday 17 April 2009: Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström were all found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine of 30 million Swedish krona (app. €2.7 million or US$3.5 million). All of the defendants appealed the verdict.\n\nThe appeal trial concluded on 15 October 2010, and the verdict was announced on 26 November. The appeal court shortened sentences of three of the defendants who appeared in court that day. Neij's sentence was reduced to 10 months, Sunde's to eight, and Lundström's to four. However, the fine was increased from 32 to 46 million kronor.\n\nOn 1 February 2012, the Supreme Court of Sweden refused to hear an appeal in the case, prompting the site to change its official domain name to thepiratebay.se from thepiratebay.org. The move to a .se domain was claimed to prevent susceptibility to US laws from taking control of the site. On 9 April 2013, the site changed its domain name to thepiratebay.gl, under the Greenland TLD, in anticipation of possible seizure by Swedish authorities of its .se domain. The change proved to be short lived, as the site returned to the .se domain on 12 April 2013 after being blocked on the .gl domain by Tele-Post, which administers domains in Greenland. Tele-Post cited a Danish court ruling that the site was in violation of copyright laws.\n\nFounders Svartholm, Neij, and Sunde were all released after having finished serving their sentences by 2015.\n\nIn May 2007, The Pirate Bay was attacked by a group of hackers. They copied the user database, which included over 1.5 million users. The Pirate Bay claimed to its users that the data was of no value and that passwords and e-mails were encrypted and hashed. Some blogs stated that a group known as the AUH (Arga Unga Hackare, Swedish for \"Angry Young Hackers\") were suspected of executing the attack; however, the AUH stated on the \"Computer Sweden\" newspaper that they were not involved and would take revenge on those responsible for the attack.\n\nOn 27 April 2009, the website of The Pirate Bay had fibre IPv4 connectivity issues. There was widespread speculation this was a forced outage from the Swedish anti-piracy group, accelerated somewhat by TPB adding contact details for the Swedish anti-piracy group's lawyers to its RIPE database record. The site and its forums were still available via IPv6 at the time.\n\nOn 24 August 2009, one of The Pirate Bay's upstream providers was ordered to discontinue service for the website by a Swedish court in response to a civil action brought by several entertainment companies including Disney, Universal, Time Warner, Columbia, Sony, NBC, and Paramount. According to the TPB Blog, this caused a downtime of 3 hours; however, some users were unable to access the site immediately following the relocation due to unrelated technical difficulties. The site was fully operational again for everyone within 24 hours.\n\nOn 6 October 2009, one of the IP transit providers to The Pirate Bay blocked all Pirate Bay traffic causing an outage for most users around the world. The same day, the site was reportedly back online at an IP address at CyberBunker, located in the Netherlands. It is not known whether The Pirate Bay is actually located at CyberBunker or whether they are using the CyberBunker service that routes Cyberbunker IP addresses to any datacenter around the world. These routes are not visible to the outside world.\n\nCyberBunker was given a court injunction on 17 May 2010, taking the site offline briefly; later that day, hosting was restored by Sweden's Pirate Party. Former spokesman for the Pirate Bay, Peter Sunde, commented that it would now be very difficult to stop the site because it would now be seen as political censorship if anyone tries to shut it down.\n\nOn 8 July 2010, a group of Argentine hackers gained access to The Pirate Bay's administration panel through a security breach via the backend of The Pirate Bay website. They were able to delete torrents and expose users' IP-addresses, emails and MD5-hashed passwords. The Pirate Bay was taken offline for upgrades. Users visiting the website were met by the following message: \"Upgrading some stuff, database is in use for backups, soon back again. Btw, it's nice weather outside I think.\"\n\nOn 16 May 2012, The Pirate Bay experienced a major DDoS attack, causing the site to be largely inaccessible worldwide for around 24 hours. The Pirate Bay said that it did not know who was behind the attack, although it \"had its suspicions\".\n\nOn 5 May 2015, The Pirate Bay went offline for several hours, apparently as a result of not properly configuring its SSL certificate.\n\nOn 30 June 2009, Swedish advertising company Global Gaming Factory X AB announced their intention to buy the site for SEK 60 million (approximately US$8.5 million) (30m SEK in cash, 30m SEK in GGF shares).\n\nThe Pirate Bay founders stated that the profits from the sale would be placed in an offshore account where it would be used to fund projects pertaining to \"freedom of speech, freedom of information, and the openness of the Internet\". Assurances were made that \"no personal data will be transferred in the eventual sale (since no personal data is kept).\" Global Gaming Chief Executive Hans Pandeya commented on the site's future by saying \"We would like to introduce models which entail that content providers and copyright owners get paid for content that is downloaded via the site\", and announced that users would be charged a monthly fee for access to The Pirate Bay.\n\nGlobal Gaming Factory's letter of intent expired at the end of September 2009, without the transaction having taken place. This may be due to the company's financial difficulties. \"PC World\" magazine regarded the deal's future as \"doomed\".\n\nOn 9 December 2014, police in Stockholm raided the company's premises and seized servers and other computers and equipment, which resulted in the website going offline. The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group. The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down. One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels. In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials. The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements. IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents. IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, to allow users to deploy their own version of the Pirate Bay website. The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites. Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable. On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag. From this day TPB was hosted for a period in Moldova, on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. The Pirate Bay then began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services. On 1 January 2015, the website presented a countdown to 1 February 2015. The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015.\n\nBeginning in October 2018, the clearnet Pirate Bay website started to be inaccessible in some locations around the world, showing Error 522. As the result, direct visits to the website dropped by more than 32 percent in October. The incident was found to be unrelated to internet provider blocking or domain name problem, but the exact cause has not been determined. The site's Tor domain and proxies remained unaffected. \n\nThe Error 522 problem occurred again in early March 2020, with the site's admins unable to say when it would be resolved. After one month the site's functionality was restored with an update of the domain records and the Cloudflare nameservers.\n\nThe Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion about legal aspects of file sharing, copyright, and civil liberties and has become a platform for political initiatives against established intellectual property laws and a central figure in an anti-copyright movement. The website faced several shutdowns and domain seizures which \"did little to take the site offline, as it simply switched to a series of new web addresses and continued to operate\".\n\nThe Pirate Bay's website has been blocked in some countries, despite the relative ease by which such blocks can be circumvented in most countries. While the URL to the Pirate Bay itself has been blocked in these countries, numerous mirror websites emerged to make the website available at different URLs, routing traffic around the block.\n\nAccording to Google chairman Eric Schmidt, \"government plans to block access to illicit filesharing websites could set a 'disastrous precedent' for freedom of speech\"; he also expressed that Google would \"fight attempts to restrict access to sites such as the Pirate Bay\".\n\nOn 13 February 2017, Sweden's Patent and Market Court of Appeal decided that the broadband provider Bredbandsbolaget must block its customers from accessing file sharing site The Pirate Bay, overruling a district court ruling to the contrary from 2015. This is the first time a site was openly blocked in Sweden. The rest of the ISPs are expected to follow the same court orders.\n\nAfter The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the social networking site Facebook, \"Wired.com\" found in May that Facebook had started blocking the links. On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked. Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a \"demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights\", following users' agreement on their terms of service. Links to other similar sites have not been blocked.\n\nIn March 2012, Microsoft blocked Windows Live Messenger messages if they contain links to The Pirate Bay. When a user sends an instant message that contains a link to The Pirate Bay, Windows Live Messenger prompts a warning and claims \"Blocked as it was reported unsafe\". \"We block instant messages if they contain malicious or spam URLs based on intelligence algorithms, third-party sources, and/or user complaints. Pirate Bay URLs were flagged by one or more of these and were consequently blocked\", Microsoft told \"The Register\" in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Pirate Bay is featured in \"Steal This Film\" (2006), a documentary series about society and filesharing, produced by The League of Noble Peers; in the Danish Documentary \"Good Copy Bad Copy\", which explores the issues surrounding file copyright; and the documentary \"TPB AFK\". The Pirate Bay has been a topic on the US-syndicated NPR radio show \"On the Media\".\n\nBjörn Ulvaeus, former member of the Swedish pop music group ABBA, criticised copyright infringing activities of The Pirate Bay supporters as \"lazy and mean\". In contrast, Brazilian best-selling author Paulo Coelho has embraced free sharing online. Coelho supports The Pirate Bay and offered to be a witness in the 2009 trial. He accounts much of his growing sales to his work shared on the Internet and comments that \"a person who does not share is not only selfish, but bitter and alone\".\n\n"}

According to her personal interview with Larry King, her father was married to another woman and supposedly in the Navy; her mother was unmarried. Crawford was adopted from a baby broker in Nevada because Joan was formally denied an adoption by social services for being an unfit candidate in California in 1940. Crawford maintains that Joan did not have a positive relationship with either her own mother or with her brother, which contributed to social services' conclusion as well as her multiple divorces.\n\nCrawford was one of five children adopted by Joan. Her siblings are Christopher (1942–2006), adopted in 1943, and twin girls — Catherine (Cathy, 1947–2020) and Cynthia (Cindy, 1947–2007) — adopted in 1947. Another boy, also named Christopher, was adopted in 1941 but was reclaimed by his birth mother. During Episode 2008 of a PBS Broadcast of \"Antiques Roadshow\" that first aired on February 23, 2019, a \"Joan Crawford\" archive was evaluated. The owner of the estate items stated that he was the grandson of a lady that was employed by Joan Crawford and had served as a nanny. The estate items included a set of instructions that were described as having been typed by Joan Crawford, and that instructed the nanny to \"tie\" one of the children (Christopher) to their highchair during the children's morning schedule.\n\nCrawford has stated that her childhood was affected by her adoptive mother's alcoholism. At 10, Crawford was sent to Chadwick School in Palos Verdes, California, which many other celebrity children attended. However, her mother sent her from Chadwick to graduate from Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy in La Cañada (now the city of La Cañada Flintridge), California, and curtailed Crawford's outside contact until her graduation. After graduating from Flintridge, she moved from California to Pittsburgh to attend Carnegie Mellon School of Drama and then to New York City, where she studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan. After seven years, she gained a Bachelor of Arts degree from UCLA. After 14 years as an actress, Crawford returned to college, graduating magna cum laude from UCLA and receiving her master's degree from the Annenberg School of Communication at USC. Then she worked in corporate communications at the Los Angeles headquarters of Getty Oil Company.\n\nCrawford met Harvey Medlinsky, a director and Broadway stage manager, while she was appearing in the Chicago national company of \"Barefoot in the Park\". They were married briefly. She met her second husband, commercial producer David Koontz, while she was working on a car commercial. She has no children.\n\nCrawford appeared in summer stock theatre, including a production of \"Splendor in the Grass\". She also acted in a number of Off-Broadway productions, including \"In Color on Sundays\" (1958). She also appeared in \"At Chrismastime\" (1959) and \"Dark of the Moon\" (1959) at the Fred Miller Theater in Milwaukee, and \"The Moon Is Blue\" (1960).\n\nIn 1960, Crawford accepted a role in the film \"Force of Impulse\", which was released in 1961. Also in 1961, Crawford appeared in a small role in \"Wild in the Country\", a film starring Elvis Presley. That year, she made a guest appearance on Dean Miller's NBC celebrity interview program \"Here's Hollywood\", promoting the films. In 1962, she appeared in the play \"The Complaisant Lover\". She played five character parts in Ben Hecht's controversial play \"Winkelberg\". The same year, she appeared on the CBS courtroom drama \"The Verdict is Yours\". In October 1965, she appeared in Neil Simon's \"Barefoot in the Park\", with Myrna Loy, a friend of her mother. She also had a role in \"Faces\", a 1968 film directed by John Cassavetes and starring John Marley and Gena Rowlands.\n\nCrawford played Joan Borman Kane on the soap opera \"The Secret Storm\" in New York from 1968 until 1969. While Crawford was in the hospital recovering from an emergency operation in October 1968, Joan, then over 60 years old, asked for the role of the 28-year-old character. She did so without mentioning it to her daughter, and under the guise of \"holding the role\" for Crawford so that the part would not be recast during her absence, she appeared in four episodes. Viewers increased 40% during this replacement time, and Crawford, already feeling betrayed, also felt embarrassed by her mother's seemingly intoxicated performance. Eventually let go from the series, Crawford believed her mother's interference had contributed to her departure. The producers, however, claimed that the character and her storyline had simply run its course.\n\nCrawford also made guest appearances on other TV programs, including \"Medical Center\", \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Matt Lincoln\", \"Ironside\" and \"The Sixth Sense\".\n\nAfter Joan Crawford died in 1977, Crawford and her brother, Christopher, discovered that their mother had disinherited them from her $2 million estate, her will citing \"reasons which are well-known to them.\" In November 1977, Crawford and her brother sued to invalidate their mother's will, which she signed on October 18, 1976. Cathy LaLonde, another Crawford daughter, and her husband, Jerome, the complaint charged, \"took deliberate advantage of decedent's seclusion and weakened and distorted mental and physical condition to insinuate themselves\" into Joan's favor. A court settlement was reached on July 13, 1979, awarding Crawford and Christopher $55,000 from their mother's estate.\n\nIn 1978, Crawford's book \"Mommie Dearest\" was released. The book accused her mother of being a cruel, violent, neglectful, and deceitful narcissistic \nfraud who adopted her children only for wealth and fame after she had been labeled \"box office poison\". In 1981, a movie adaptation of the book was released, starring Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford and Mara Hobel (Mara Boyd) as very young Christina, later Diana Scarwid as adult Christina Crawford. The film, while critically panned, grossed more than $39 million worldwide from a $5 million budget and garnered five Golden Raspberry Awards, including worst picture. Crawford has published five subsequent books, including \"Survivor\".\n\nAfter a near-fatal stroke in 1981, she spent five years in rehabilitation before moving to the Northwest. She ran a bed and breakfast called Seven Springs Farms in Tensed, Idaho, between 1994 and 1999. She formed Seven Springs Press in 1998 to self-publish the 20th-anniversary edition of \"Mommie Dearest\" in paperback from the original manuscript and included new material about the years after her graduation from high school.\n\nIn 2000, Crawford began working as Entertainment Manager at the Coeur d'Alene Casino in Idaho, where she worked until 2007. She then wrote and produced a regional TV series, \"Northwest Entertainment\". On November 22, 2009, she was appointed county commissioner in Benewah County, Idaho, by Governor Butch Otter, but she lost her bid for election in November 2010. In 2011, Crawford founded the non-profit Benewah Human Rights Coalition and served as the organization's first president. In 2013, she made a documentary, \"Surviving Mommie Dearest\".\n\nOn November 21, 2017, the e-book editions of \"Mommie Dearest\", \"Survivor\", and \"Daughters of the Inquisition\" were published through Open Road Integrated Media. She is also currently working with composer David Nehls on a stage musical adaptation of \"Mommie Dearest\", to be produced in regional theater. Crawford is currently writing the third book in her memoir trilogy, following \"Mommie Dearest\" and \"Survivor\".\n\n\n\n \n"}

The 12.7 kilometre route is operated by Z, A and B class trams from Glenhuntly depot.\n\nThe route starts at Melbourne University and operates via Swanston Street, St Kilda Road, Brighton Road and Glen Huntly Road to its terminus on the corner of Truganini and Koornang Roads in Carnegie.\n\nRoute 67 was first allocated to the line between Carnegie and the City (Swanston Street) on 1 November 1970, as part of a network-wide renumbering scheme. Prior to that, the line to Carnegie was serviced by Route 4. When route numbers were first introduced to Melbourne's tram network, Route 67 was allocated to the route between Point Ormond and Elsternwick. A number revision in 1938 led to Route 67 being allocated between Balaclava Junction and St Kilda Beach via Dandenong Road and St Kilda Junction. Further changes on 1 August 1955 led to Route 67 becoming a shortworking for West Coburg services terminating in the City (William St) rather than Domain Road. Trams traditionally terminated at the Victoria St terminus, but following an accident in 1991, trams instead terminated at the Queensberry St crossover. Due to congestion during peak hours at the crossover, some trams continued north to Melbourne University. Finally on 17 January 1996, a permanent shunt was built at Melbourne University. From then on, Route 67 trams were altered run full-time to Melbourne University.\n\nThe origins of route 67 lie in separate tram lines. The section of track between Queensberry Street (Stop 4) and Brunning Street (Stop 38) is the oldest section of this route, dating back to the Brighton Road cable tram which opened on 11 October 1888 by the Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company. This cable tram line was electrified in stages by the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB). The section between Domain Interchange (Stop 20) and St Kilda Junction (Stop 30) was electrified on 27 December 1925. The section between Queensberry Street and City Road (near Stop 14) was electrified on the same day. The line between City Road and Domain Interchange was electrified on 24 January 1926. The Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust opened the Glenhuntly Road line between Elsternwick (Stop 44) and Grange Road (Stop 62) on 13 November 1913. The Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board extended this line to Carnegie on 19 December 1926. The section of track between Brunning Street and Glenhuntly Road (Stop 43) opened on 29 August 1926.\n\nIn January 2016, route 67 began operating through the night on Fridays and Saturdays as part of the Night Network.\n\n"}

Though the Austrian possessions were not part of the Swabian Principality of Fürstenberg, the princely family owns Weitra Castle up to today.\n\nCount Frederick IV of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg (1563–1617) had acquired the remote Weitra estates in the Austrian Waldviertel region by marriage in 1607.

Capital levies are considered difficult for a government to implement.\n\nSome economists argue that capital levies are a disincentive to savings and investment, and cause capital flight, but others argue that in theory this need not be the case. The latter view was popular in the World Wars; in the 2010s, it has also gained some acceptance as more heavily indebted nations struggle to raise revenues.\n\nIn ancient Athens during its democracy, there was a form of capital levy known as a liturgy ().

An Athenian could volunteer for such a levy, but if no-one volunteered, a wealthy person meeting the eligibility requirements would be ordered to supply it. They could escape by nominating someone wealthier to take over the duty; if the nominated person disputed this, the nominator could take the liturgy, or offer to exchange property with their nominee (antidosis). If the nominee refused, the matter went to court, and the liturgy was assigned whoever the court case determined to be wealthier. Athenians often concealed their wealth to escape taxation, and sycophants who discovered concealed wealth might use it as blackmail material. Antidosis helped the state identify the wealthiest people, and kept the rich suspicious of one another. Athens also had a wealth tax called eisphora (see symmoria), and for this purpose the city required each rich person give an estimate of his fortune (τίμημα). These self-assessments were not very accurate. The liturgy has not been much studied by economists.\n\nDuring both World Wars, capital levies were introduced, with the generally-stated aim of distributing the sacrifices required by the war more evenly. This had a significant effect on both income and wealth distributions, lasting decades into the post-war period. Such policies were commonly referred to as the \"conscription of wealth\".\n\nThe Economist, a British publication, opposed capital levies, but supported \"direct taxation heavy enough to amount to rationing of citizens' incomes\"; similarly, the American economist Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague, in the Economic Journal, argued that that \"conscription of men should logically and equitably be accompanied by something in the nature of conscription of current income above that which is absolutely necessary\".\n\nThe Italian government of Giuliano Amato imposed a 0.6 percent levy on all bank deposits on 11 July 1992.\n\nIn 1999, Donald Trump proposed for the United States a one off 14.25% levy on the net worth of individuals and trusts worth $10 million or more. Trump claimed that this would generate $5.7 trillion in new taxes, which could be used to eliminate the national debt.\n\nThe Cypriot government levied 47.5 percent of Bank of Cyprus deposits over one hundred thousand Euros in July 2013. In October 2013, the International Monetary Fund released a report stating, \"The sharp deterioration of the public finances in many countries has revived interest in a 'capital levy' – a one-off tax on private wealth – as an exceptional measure to restore debt sustainability. The appeal is that such a tax, if it is implemented before avoidance is possible and there is a belief that it will never be repeated, does not distort behavior.\" The next year the Bundesbank proposed that Eurozone countries should attempt a one-off levy of bank deposits to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nA February 2014 report by Reuters showed the idea had gained traction in the European Commission, which will ask its insurance watchdog later that year for advice on a possible draft law \"to mobilize more personal pension savings for long-term financing\".\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest of three children born to James William Marshall and Ellen Marshall, née Skeet. His mother died in 1901, aged 24, leaving James to raise the children on his own.\n\nMarshall joined the Essex Yeomanry in 1915, at the age of seventeen, after lying about his age; he took part in the Battle of Loos in the same year. He was given the nickname \"Smiler\" after he threw a snowball at a drill sergeant who threatened to \"give him something to smile about\". This event occurred during his basic training at Stanway.\n\nMarshall served in the 1/1st Essex Yeomanry and later the 8th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps between 1915 and 1919 and saw action at the Battle of the Somme, Battle of Arras, the Third Battle of Ypres, the Germany Offensive of 1918 as well as the Advance to Victory and the Army of Occupation campaigns at the end of the war. Marshall recalled the horrors of the battlefield and his memories of seeing many of his comrades blown to bits by enemy shells or mown down in No Man's Land by a haze of bullets.\n\nThe Battle of the Somme, beginning on 1 July 1916, had no greater resonance for Smiler than all the other battles he had fought throughout the war. He had been sent to France in late 1915 and despite a number of periods of home leave had remained in or near the front line for the remainder of the war. He was present on the Somme for the first day of the offensive in which over 20,000 troops were killed in the first several hours, with 40,000 more injured, making the battle one of the heaviest death and wounded tolls of the war. Marshall had been kept well behind the lines during the opening day of the Somme campaign waiting for a breakthrough, however it did not come.\n\nAs a result of his unit being kept back during the Somme, Marshall was not credited with being the last veteran of the opening day; nonetheless, he remembered the trauma and horror of that campaign and the images on the battlefield remained with him. He later recalled picking up and sending home the letters found next to the body of a man killed near Mametz Wood.\n\nIn March 1917, Marshall suffered a blighty wound in the hand and was sent home. On his return he joined the Machine Gun Corps and fought at the Battle of Cambrai where he was captured as a Prisoner of War by the Germans. Smiler was released by his captors as they were short of rations and returned to the front.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1918, Marshall volunteered for a tour of duty in Ireland and was stationed near Dublin. He was demobbed in 1921 and returned home to Tendring where he married Florence C. Day. The couple had five children.\n\nIn his later years, Marshall continued to live in a small house, which was attached to a larger house in which he had worked for the owner since the Second World War. He kept by his bedside a wooden cross taken from the rubble of Albert Basilica at the time of the Battle of Somme.\n\nIn the final decade of his life, Marshall was awarded the Legion d’honneur and appeared on numerous television shows as well as attending a veterans' party at Buckingham Palace. He also took part in three pilgrimages to the battlefields of the First World War, including one to mark the 80th anniversary of the Third Battle of Ypres.\n\nMarshall died at the age of 108 on 16 May 2005 in Ashtead, Surrey. At the time of his death he was survived by one son; twelve grandchildren; twenty-four great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.\n\nMarshall's legacy as one of the last surviving veterans of the First World War was that he was able to claim a number of records: the last man to wear the 1914-15 Star; the last man to serve on the Somme and perhaps, the most significant for a man who had served in the Essex Yeomanry, the last man to have served in the cavalry.\n\n\n"}

He was Sinn Féin's longest sitting councillor and is currently an MLA for West Belfast as well as being a former councillor for the Laganbank area of Belfast.\n\nMaskey was educated at St Malachy's College and at the Belfast Institute for Further and Higher Education and then worked in Belfast docks as a labourer and barman. He was a successful amateur boxer, having only lost 4 out of 75 fights.\n\nWhen the Troubles broke out in 1969 he became involved with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and was interned twice in the 1970s.\n\nMaskey stood unsuccessfully in West Belfast in the 1982 Assembly Election. In June 1983, Maskey won a by-election and became the first member of Sinn Féin to be elected to Belfast City Council. He was greeted with boos and jeers when he entered the chamber for his first council meeting, and unionist councillors started stamping their feet and screaming when he attempted to deliver his maiden speech in Irish.\n\nMaskey emerged as a key ally of Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams' approach to the strategy. In 1987 he survived being shot at close range by loyalist paramilitaries. He was targeted again by loyalists in 1988, and also a gun attack at his home in 1993 when one his friends was killed. In 1996 Maskey was elected to the Northern Ireland Peace Forum for the Belfast West constituency but did not attend the Forum in accordance with Sinn Féin's policy of abstentionism. Two years later he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which on this occasion Sinn Féin did not boycott.\n\nMaskey's growing political profile led him to contest the Belfast South constituency in the 2001 general election as part of Sinn Féin's strategy of building up their vote in one of their weaker constituencies.\n\nIn the local elections held on the same day he switched to the Laganbank area of South Belfast and won a seat there.\n\nIn 2002 Maskey became the first ever republican to serve as Lord Mayor of Belfast. His first duty in office was to open the annual Presbyterian General Assembly despite being a non-Presbyterian.\n\nMaskey garnered general praise when as part of his duties as Lord Mayor in July 2002 he laid a wreath in memorial of British soldiers who died in the First World War. However he declined to attend the main memorial ceremony, stating that it was \"the military commemoration of the Battle of the Somme\". In his office he flew the British Union Jack and the Irish tricolour side by side.\n\nIn the 2003 Assembly election Maskey stood in South Belfast again and won Sinn Féin's first seat there with a boost in the vote share. He contested the seat in the 2005 general election with the vote share down on the Assembly elections, losing to the Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate, Alasdair McDonnell.\n\nOn 25 December 2005, Maskey suffered a heart attack while with his family. Several weeks later he appeared on BBC Radio Ulster to talk about his health.\n\nIn 2006 he participated in the negotiations resulting in the Basque nationalist organisation ETA truce announced on 22 March. On 23 April 2007 he was announced as one of three Sinn Féin members who would sit on the re-vamped Northern Ireland Policing Board.\n\nMaskey resigned from Belfast City Council in October 2010, as part of Sinn Féin's policy of abolishing double jobbing.\n\nWith the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, Maskey was elected Speaker on 11 January 2020.\n\n"}

Cherry Hill Mall is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and is bound by Route 38, Haddonfield Road (County Route 644), Church Road (County Route 616), and Cherry Hill Mall Drive.\n\nThe center was designed by architect Victor Gruen and built and managed by The Rouse Company. Rouse sold its shopping center portfolio to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust in 2003 as PREIT converted its holdings from residential to retail. The mall has a gross leasable area of , placing it in the top ten among the largest shopping malls in New Jersey. Cherry Hill Mall is widely held to be the source of the 1962 renaming of what had been called Delaware Township to its current name of Cherry Hill Township. The town was named Cherry Hill in a voter referendum due to the development of a new U.S. Postal Service office for the region, and historical ties to Cherry Hill Farm, which once occupied land opposite the current mall site, and various locations named for the farm, including the Cherry Hill Estates housing development and the Cherry Hill Inn. The mall is currently anchored by JCPenney, Macy's, and Nordstrom.\n\nCherry Hill Mall opened on October 11, 1961 on the former site of the 16 acre George Jaus farm. It was designed by Victor Gruen and built and managed by The Rouse Company at a cost of $30 million. Upon opening, it became largest mall in the nation and is commonly referred to as the first enclosed and climate-controlled mall in the Eastern United States. The mall featured 90 stores, exotic birds, tropical plants, fountains and a movie theater, something unlike anything in what was called Delaware Township had ever seen.\n\nThe mall layout was unique for the time. Unlike the dumbbell malls of the time, the mall started from the east anchor, Bamberger's, with a large \"Delaware Mall\" concourse to the west of it. About halfway along this concourse was an exit way that led back to a twin movie theatre and a children's amusement park with 6 rides and a mini roller coaster with a giant arcade. The center of the mall featured Cherry Court, a court with high ceilings, more tropical plants, fountains, parrots, plus a staircase leading directly to the second floor into Strawbridge & Clothier. The northern wing featured the \"Market Court\", Food Fair, and Thrift Drug. There were also a Kresge's, Woolworth's, and two liquor stores.\n\nThe mall changed through the years; 1973 brought a detached nine-story office tower. In 1977 a new two-story wing was built in the north part of the mall, following the closure and demolition of Pantry Pride and the Market Court. This wing was anchored by JCPenney. The 1990s brought more change to the mall, with the mall being remodeled once more, featuring a teal/gray color scheme and skylights. The mall received different fountains and the ornate Strawbridge's staircase was replaced with a simple escalator/stairs combination. By 1997, two distinct parts of the mall had formed: an upscale wing near Macy's featuring Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret, while the JCPenney wing featured General Nutrition Centers and several urban shops. In 2003, the mall was sold to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT).\n\nUnder PREIT's ownership, Old Navy moved in early on, but the company had bigger plans for the mall. From the period of 2007 to 2009, the mall underwent a massive $220 million renovation that saw 228,000 sq ft. of new retail added. Jim Ryan and his team at JPRA Architects were brought in to create the mall’s new design. Following Strawbridge's closure after the Macy's takeover, the store was razed and backfilled to make way for the new Grand Court featuring 140,000 sq ft. of new retail, along with a new 138,000 sq ft. Nordstrom anchor store which opened on March 27, 2009. Additionally, the mall added several exterior-facing restaurants in a new section known as Bistro Row. A large-scale entrance to an H&M store to the frontage of Route 38 was also added, while the food court was also moved to the JCPenney wing, in a much smaller configuration than the mall's original food court but now features many eateries. The mall also added The Container Store and Crate & Barrel as outparcel retailers outside the mall's parking lot. Additionally, a three-story parking garage was constructed, while the whole mall was gutted for a clean contemporary marble-and-wood color scheme. The new changes created a new tenant mix similar to King of Prussia. The mall today consists of many upscale stores in a newly renovated interior and exterior. Cherry Hill Mall has completely changed its entire exterior and interior, bringing many high-end stores, new restaurants, and a revitalizing theme running throughout the center.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1923942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923942", "title": "Lewis Collins", "text": "Lewis Collins\n\nLewis Collins (27 May 1946 – 27 November 2013) was an English film and theatre actor. His career-defining role was playing 'Bodie' in the late 1970s – early 1980s British television series \"The Professionals\".\n\nCollins was born in Bidston, Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula in Merseyside. At the age of two he won 'The Most Beautiful Baby in Liverpool' contest. He was educated at Gautby Road Primary School and Grange School in Birkenhead, and the Birkenhead Institute School.\n\nWhen he was 13 years of age his father Bill, a jazz dance band leader, bought him a drum kit. His first gig was playing with his father's band, and he also joined a group of older school pupils to form a band called \"The Renegades\" at the start of the Merseybeat music scene in Liverpool in the late 1950s. His passion for firearms started in his youth from a membership of the \"Liverpool Central Rifle Club\". On leaving school, he took an apprentice hairdresser's position at the Andre Bernard Salon, alongside fellow apprentice Mike McCartney (stage name Mike McGear – later a member of the comedy, music and poetry trio The Scaffold). In the same period Collins was writing songs with Mike McCartney, and when the drummer Pete Best was dropped from The Beatles, Mike McCartney suggested Collins as a possible replacement to his elder brother Paul McCartney. Turning down the option of an audition with The Beatles, Collins continued playing music on an amateur basis for a number of local bands, including \"The Eyes\", and \"The Georgians\".\n\nIn late 1964, Collins quit hairdressing to become the bass player with The Mojos (which his father managed), performing on their charting singles \"Goodbye Dolly Gray\" and \"Until My Baby Comes Home\", and moved from Liverpool to London with them when the band appeared to have good commercial prospects. However the band failed to chart again and broke up, and finding himself in the midst of cosmopolitan London in 1966 during the Swinging Sixties, Collins made a living engaged in temping work such as delivery van driving, cleaning windows and being a waiter, before deciding that he wanted to become an actor after hearing a play being performed on the radio.\n\nHaving been accepted for training in acting by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, which he attended between 1968 and 1971, he drew the notice of his fellow students for an \"electrifying\" performance in the lead role of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nOn graduation from LAMDA he joined the Chesterfield Civic Theatre's Repertory Company in 1971, moving to the company of the Citizen’s Theatre, in Glasgow in 1972 under the director Giles Havergal. While in Glasgow he also taught deaf and mute children mobility skills, learning British sign language so he could communicate with them, later saying that this was the most satisfying work that he had done in his life. In 1972 he appeared in seven plays in Glasgow including the lead in Marlowe's \"Tamburlaine the Great\". He then went with Havergal on an acting teaching tour with the Prospect Theatre Company in the United States and Canada, before returning to the British Isles to appear in London's West End, starring in \"City Sugar\" and \"The Threepenny Opera\", and at the Royal Court Theatre in the play \"The Farm\" in 1973, directed by Lindsay Anderson.\n\nAfter moving into film acting in the mid-1970s he intermittently returned to the stage throughout his career. He performed in a pantomime of \"Babes in the Wood\" at the King's Theatre in Southsea in Christmas 1983. In the mid-1990s he performed in an English provincial tour of the play \"Who killed Agatha Christie\" by Tudor Gates. His last performance in theatre was a 1999–2000 provincial tour in the English Midlands of J.B. Priestley's \"Dangerous Corner\".\n\nWhile appearing in \"The Farm\" at the Royal Court in 1973 Collins received an offer for his first television role in the British Broadcasting Corporation's police drama \"Z Cars\". His first major television role was in Granada Television's comedy series \"The Cuckoo Waltz\" from 1975 to 1977 in the role of Gavin Rumsey, alongside his landlord played by David Roper and landlady Diane Keen, whom his character was constantly trying to seduce. By the mid 1970s he was regularly appearing on British television dramas in multiple roles.\n\nIn 1976 the dramatist and television producer Brian Clemens wrote a new British television crime-action drama series entitled \"The Professionals\", modelled on the success of the hit American television series \"Starsky and Hutch\". It was also intended to be a more realistic follow-up to a prior successful television series that he had just produced about government agents entitled \"The New Avengers\".<br>\n\nAs with the previous series Clemens planned to have a split leads casting arrangement for the new show. Having cast the actor Martin Shaw, Clemens found in the first week of filming that the initial partnership he had arranged for the recording of the pilot episode with the actor Anthony Andrews lacked personal on-screen chemistry due to the similarity of the acting styles of Andrews and Shaw. He thought of Collins as an alternative after seeing a recently filmed episode of \"The New Avengers\", in which Collins and Shaw (both trained at LAMDA) had appeared alongside one another and there had been a noticeable dynamic tension between them, both in their acting style and off-screen private personalities. After a screen test of Collins, he replaced Anthony Andrews as 'William Bodie'. Although not getting on particularly well with one another personally, the good-humoured antagonism and bravado between Collins and Shaw on-screen worked well and the series was highly successful on British television for the next six years, making household names of them both. The production came to an end in 1981, although new episodes continued to be shown onscreen until early 1983.\n\nCollins was a private in the 10th Battalion Parachute Regiment of the British Army (a Territorial Army unit) in the late 1970s to early 1980s. He applied to join the Territorial SAS but was rejected because of his celebrity status, despite passing the entrance tests. From 15-23 March 1980 Collins with several volunteers from the Parachute Regiment, along with the British boxer John Conteh, took part in a forced march in military service conditions from London to Liverpool up the A41 road, the funds raised from the event being donated to a charity for crippled children.\n\nIn 1982 he auditioned for the role of \"007\" with Eon Productions, the highly successful \"James Bond\" global cinema franchise, to succeed an aging Roger Moore, but the audition with its producer Cubby Broccoli did not go well and he was rejected as being \"too aggressive\". Collins regarded this failure in retrospect as the key missed opportunity of his acting career. In 1982 he broke into cinema starring in the role of a British Army officer confronting terrorists in the commercially successful film \"Who Dares Wins\".\n\nAs the 1980s progressed Collins attempted to maintain a cinematic career. An initial plan to continue to make feature films with the \"Who Dares Wins\" producer Euan Lloyd, including one set in the Falklands War provisionally entitled \"Task Force South\", came to nothing, so he instead signed a German-Italian co-production contract to star in three mercenary war genre feature films directed by Antonio Margheriti set in the Third World, viz., \"\" (1984), \"Kommando Leopard\" (1985) and \"Der Commander\" (1988), which attempted to capitalize on the recent box-office hits of \"The Wild Geese\" and \"The Dogs of War\", but they were commercially unsuccessful, and in consequence he went back to working in British television production.\n\nIn 1986 he played the French medieval war-lord Philip Marc in the series \"Robin of Sherwood\". In 1988 he played second lead to Michael Caine in the highly successful British television film \"Jack the Ripper\".\n\nAt the start of the 1990s he appeared in the role of \"Colonel Mustard\" in the British television drama/gameshow \"Cluedo\" (1991–92), and the roles became sparser as the decade progressed. In the early 1990s, seeking to extend his career options in drama to work beyond acting he attended courses in screenwriting and direction at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in Los Angeles, California, US, but this led to no subsequent professional employment. In the mid 1990s he moved his family to Los Angeles, where he was residing part-time, while he returned to England intermittently for the occasional provincial theatre tour and minor acting roles in television productions.\n\nIn March 1997 Collins announced in an interview on British television that he was in discussions with a production company to star in a new series based on \"The Professionals\", reprising his career signature role of \"William Bodie\" as the CI5 Agency's Chief in the part played by Gordon Jackson in the original series. However after months of negotiations it was announced by the producer David Wickes that Collins had been dropped as a casting option for the role for undisclosed reasons, and it had been given to the actor Edward Woodward instead. The new show, entitled \"\", went on to be a commercial and critical failure, and was abandoned after one series.\n\nCollins' final acting performance was in an episode of the British television police drama series\"The Bill\" entitled \"034\" in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Collins left Britain and abandoned acting and drama, and saw out his last decade in private business in the United States selling computer equipment.\n\nIn early 2012 his return to acting was announced by his theatrical agent issuing a statement that he had been cast to play the role of the Earl Godwin in the historically based feature film production \"1066\", but in June 2013 it was announced by the same source that he had withdrawn from the production due to ill health.\n\nAfter being first diagnosed in 2008, Collins died at the age of 67 from cancer in Los Angeles on 27 November 2013. Shortly before his death he had returned to visit England, spending some time in Merseyside.\n\nCollins' body was cremated. An urn holding his ashes is deposited in a memorial display cabinet at the North Pacifica Mausoleum section of Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.\n\nCollins married Michelle Larrett, a school-teacher, in 1992. The couple had three sons; Oliver, Elliot and Cameron.\n\nHe held a private pilot's licence, a black belt in jujitsu and had trained in karate. His hobbies included parachuting, motorbikes, collecting firearms and sports shooting and he continued to play musical instruments throughout his life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1923951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923951", "title": "Nicholas Marcellus Hentz", "text": "Nicholas Marcellus Hentz\n\nNicholas Marcellus Hentz (July 25, 1797 – November 4, 1856) was a French American educator and arachnologist.\n\nHentz was born in Versailles, France. He was the youngest child of Charles Nicholas Arnould Hentz and Marie-Anne Therese Daubree Hentz. He studied medicine and learned the art of miniature painting in Paris. His father was an active Republican and participant in the French Revolution. Upon the restoration of the Bourbons in 1815, his father was banished from France. So, in 1816, Marcellus immigrated with his family to the United States, where they settled in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He taught French and miniature painting in Boston, Philadelphia, and other places. He became a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) in 1819. His illustrations were published in their journal. Among these illustrations are three well known watercolors, two of which are of freshwater fish from Alabama (painted in 1847) and one is a miniature of Hentz's father-in-law, John Whiting (painted 1824-1850). In 1820, Hentz enrolled as a medical student at Harvard but soon after abandoned his studies to teach. In 1824/5 he was associated with George Bancroft in the Round Hill School at Northampton, Massachusetts. From 1826 to 1830, he was professor of modern languages and belles lettres in the University of North Carolina. In 1827, he became the \"chair of modern languages\" at the university. In 1830, Hentz conducted a female academy for two years. Following, he conducted various schools in Cincinnati, Ohio, 1832–1834; Florence, Alabama, 1834–1843; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 1843–1845; Tuskeegee, Alabama, 1845–1848; and Columbia, Alabama, 1848–1849. After 1851, Hentz and his wife lived with his son in Marianna, Florida, where he eventually succumbed to an illness in 1856.\n\nHe married Caroline Lee Whiting on 30 September 1824, and moved with his wife to Covington, Kentucky, in 1831. Caroline was an author with numerous published works in periodicals and newspapers. It is rumored that although not a revolutionary, her female characters exhibited strong qualities for assertiveness and independence possibly as consequence of an oppressive relationship with her husband. Her last novel, \"Ernest Linwood\" (1858), was based on an incident in which Hentz became jealous of Caroline's admirers and resulted in the end of their residence in Cincinnati. Professor Hentz and his wife had five children: Marcellus Fabius (1825–1827), Charles Arnould (1827–1894), Julia Louisa (1829–1877), Thaddeus William Harris(1830–1878), and Caroline Therese (1833–1904). Julia was born at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. She was educated by both of her parents and married in 1846 to Dr. John Washington Keyes in Tuskegee. Julia wrote several short poems but most of her works were never published. Her most well known work was a prize poem called \"A Dream of Locust Dell\". The youngest daughter, Caroline Therese was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and also educated by her parents and married the Baptist pastor, Rev. James O. Branch. She went on to publish tales and sketches published in magazines. Charles Arnould became a physician (Allopath).\n\nAs the most accomplished entomologist in the United States, Hentz was offered an honorary M.A. degree by the University of North Carolina in 1829. Yet, there were mixed feelings in the community about the renowned scholar. The community at the university was largely Presbyterian and did not approve of Hentz's Roman Catholic background, and was predisposed to \"ejaculatory prayer\". The professor also had a severe nervous disorder. Many of his students thought the study of French went against their religious principles. Consequently, Hentz was suspected of French revolutionary liberalism. Professor Hentz resigned from the university in 1833 after finding new academic regulations too restrictive. After Hentz left the university, French was completely dropped from the curriculum.\n\nHentz became a pioneering zoologist in the field of arachnology. In France, he had developed a long lasting friendship with Thomas Say (1787–1834). Originally, he and Say were going to collaborate and illustrate a collection called \"American Entomology\". In the United States, Hentz took to collecting insects. He sold his collection to the Boston Society of Natural History in the 1840s. Hentz is best known for describing 141 spider species and these descriptions were published in the society's journal between 1842 and 1850. He was one of the first to collect and document North American spiders. As is custom in binomial naming, each species was noted with his name and the year Hentz classified them. A few spiders from his collection are the Yellow sac spider, the Southern house spider, a common tarantula, and a genus of jumping spider.\nHentz made his first publication on alligators in 1820 which was followed by French textbooks issued between 1822 and 1839. In 1825, he published a novel about the Indian massacre of 1778. This novel is called \"Tadeuskund, the Last King of the Lenape, an Historical Tale\". Finally, his major collection in arachnology was republished in 1875. This collection is entitled \"The Spiders of the United States: A Collection of the Arachnological Writings of Nicholas Marcellus Hentz, M.D.\"\n\n"}

It was on the direct caravan route from the Niger river to Tangier, and attained a considerable degree of prosperity. In the 17th century, the Alaouite dynasty of Morocco is known to have started in Tafilalt, and in 1606 Zidan al-Nasir, Sultan of Morocco hid in Tafilalt, where he made a profit off of gold mined in the area, built an army, and took back control over Marrakech. A few years later in 1610, Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli also built up an army in the Tafilalt area and took Marrakech back for himself, but lost control after Sidi Yahya ben Younes liberated the city for al-Nasir. A decade after this, a small revolt built up in Tafilalt against the sultan, but was repressed after four months of skirmishes. Later, Tafilalt was a major center of the Dila'ites. In 1648, a custom was established of the Moorish sultans of Morocco sending superfluous sons or daughters to Tafilalt.\n\nMedieval traveller Ibn Batuta wrote about visiting Sijilmasa (near Tafilalt) in the fourteenth century on his journey from Fez to Mali, \"the country of the blacks\".

Its department stores are JCPenney and Macy's. There is a food court on the second floor, which was originally the second floor of a Woolworth. An office building called One Oxford Valley is located next to the mall.\n\nThe Oxford Valley Mall was developed by The Kravco Company and opened in 1973. In 1986, the Gimbels store was converted to Stern's after Allied Stores purchased seven Gimbels locations in the Philadelphia area. That same year, Bamberger's became Macy's. In 1989, Sears replaced Stern's after the latter closed several stores in the Philadelphia area. The mall underwent a renovation in 1990. In 1992, a separate, 10 screen movie theater was added behind Sears (4 new auditoriums were added in 2004). In 1995, the mall opened its food court on the second floor, replacing what had been the second floor of a Woolworth store. In addition, the mall replaced the spiral pedestrian ramp and fountain with a glass-enclosed elevator, upgraded the air conditioning system, and extensively renovated the JCPenney and Sears stores. All fountains were eventually removed with only the outdoor one remaining. The same year, Wanamaker's was converted to Hecht's. In 1997, Hecht's became Strawbridge's after its parent company, May Department Stores, acquired the Strawbridge's chain. In 2006, the Strawbridge's store closed as a result of Federated Department Stores acquiring May Department Stores, with Boscov's taking over the former store. The Boscov's store closed in 2008 as part of their restructuring. On October 15, 2018, Sears announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide as a result of the company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The store closed on January 7, 2019. This left Macy's and JCPenney the only anchors. \n\nIn August 2019, a local news agency reported that Simon Property Group and multiple other related entities have proposed a plan to redevelop the mall and the surrounding property into a mixed use center, including the addition of a 600 unit high-end apartment complex in place of the former Boscov's anchor; that would include studio-2 bedroom units, a fitness center, indoor and outdoor common spaces, dog park, pools, full-time management, maintenance, and concierge services like dog walking on site. Other possible additions include new eateries, a “lifestyle complex,” new retailers, and refreshed office space. According to sources, an area of the parking lot will be used for the possible developments \n\n"}

It is a synthesizing discipline which shares both topical and methodological similarities with history, anthropology, ecology, geology, environmental studies, literary studies, and other fields. Although the majority of work in historical geography is considered human geography, the field also encompasses studies of geographic change which are not primarily anthropogenic. Historical geography is often a major component of school and university curricula in geography and social studies. Current research in historical geography is being performed by scholars in more than forty countries. \n\nHistorical geography seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding their interaction with their local environment and surroundings.\n\nIn its early days, historical geography was difficult to define as a subject. A textbook from the 1950s cites a previous definition as an 'unsound attempt by geographers to explain history'. Its author, J. B. Mitchell, came down firmly on the side of geography: 'the historical geographer is a geographer first last and all the time'. By 1975 the first number of the \"Journal of Historical Geography\" had widened the discipline to a broader church: 'the writings of scholars of any disciplinary provenance who have something to say about matters of geographical interest relating to past time'.\n\nFor some in the United States of America, the term \"historical geography\" has a more specialized meaning: the name given by Carl Ortwin Sauer of the University of California, Berkeley to his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) along regional lines, beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. To Sauer, a landscape and the cultures in it could only be understood if all of its influences through history were taken into account: physical, cultural, economic, political, environmental. Sauer stressed regional specialization as the only means of gaining sufficient expertise on regions of the world. Sauer's philosophy was the principal shaper of American geographic thought in the mid-20th century. Regional specialists remain in academic geography departments to this day. Despite this, some geographers feel that it harmed the discipline; that too much effort was spent on data collection and classification, and too little on analysis and explanation. Studies became more and more area-specific as later geographers struggled to find places to make names for themselves. These factors may have led in turn to the 1950s crisis in geography, which raised serious questions about geography as an academic discipline in the USA.\n\nThis sub-branch of human geography is closely related to history, environmental history, and historical ecology. \n\n\n\n"}

The two major types are limestone, which is composed of calcite or aragonite (different crystal forms of CaCO) and dolomite rock, also known as dolostone, which is composed of mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO)).\n\nCalcite can be either dissolved by groundwater or precipitated by groundwater, depending on several factors including the water temperature, pH, and dissolved ion concentrations. Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called retrograde solubility in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases.\n\nWhen conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together or it can fill fractures.\n\nKarst topography and caves develop in carbonate rocks because of their solubility in dilute acidic groundwater. Cooling groundwater or mixing of different groundwaters will also create conditions suitable for cave formation.\n\nMarble is the metamorphic carbonate rock. Rare igneous carbonate rocks exist as intrusive carbonatites and even rarer volcanic carbonate lava.\n\n"}

Self-defined as \"a hunter who works as a writer,\" he is best known for his Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay nominations for \"Babel\" and his screenplay for \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada\", which received the 2005 Cannes Best Screenplay Award.\n\nArriaga was born 13 March 1958 in Mexico City. At the age of 13, he lost the sense of smell after a brutal street fight that would later serve as inspiration for some of his work.\n\nBefore engaging in his writing career, Arriaga tried out a variety of jobs and professions, amongst which were that of boxer, basketball player and professional soccer player. He completed a B.A. in Communications and a M.A. in Psychology at the Ibero-American University.\n\nWhile teaching at the Universidad Iberoamericana, Arriaga met future film director Alejandro González Iñárritu and decided to make a feature length, multiplot film set in Mexico City. The result was \"Amores Perros\" (2000). The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film as well as a BAFTA Film Award for \"Best Film not in the English Language,\" the \"Critics Week Grand Prize\" and \"Young Critics Award\" at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, as well as many other awards from festivals and societies around the world. \n\nThe success of \"Amores Perros\" earned Arriaga and Iñárritu an invitation to the U.S. to work on the Universal/Focus Features film \"21 Grams\", starring Benicio del Toro, Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. Del Toro and Watts received Academy Award nominations for their performances. \n\nGonzález Iñárritu and Arriaga collaborated on a third movie, \"Babel\", to form a trilogy with his first two pictures focusing on the theme of death. However, friction between writer and director led to González Iñárritu banning Arriaga from attending the 2006 Cannes screening of \"Babel\". Nevertheless, González Iñárritu and Arriaga both received Academy Award nominations for their work.\n\nOn 19 January 2007, the film adaptation of his book \"El Búfalo de la Noche\" directed by Jorge Hernandez Aldana premiered at the Sundance film festival. It features a score by Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta.\n\nOn 29 August 2008, \"The Burning Plain\" was premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Arriaga wrote the script and pitched it to American producers, who talked with some directors. Arriaga eventually directed the film, starring Charlize Theron.\n\nIn 2011, Mexican producers including Arriaga, Alex Garcia, and Lucas Akoskin unveiled \"Heartbeat of the World,\" an international cinema project with four films tackling topics including religion, sexuality, politics and drug addiction. Each of the four feature films consist of a collaborative set of 10 shorts. The first film in the series—\"Words with Gods\"—includes contributions from Arriaga, Emir Kusturica, Brazil's Jose Padilha, Australia's Warwick Thornton, Iran's Bahman Ghobadi, India's Mira Nair, and Japan's Hideo Nakata. The three other films are the \"drug-themed \"Into the Bloodstream\"; \"Encounters\", a look at sexual identity and expression; and \"Polis\", which delves into political topics.\" Financing for all four movies have been secured, with each produced in 14 months.\n\nGuillermo Arriaga won the \"Premio Alfaguara de Novela\" for his novel, \"Salvar el fuego\" on January 24, 2020.\n\nArriaga objects to being called a \"guionista\" (Spanish for \"screenwriter\"); he advocates for screenwriters being referred to as \"writers\" and screenplays being referred to as \"works of film.\" He has clarified that he has no objections to the term's use in English; his issue with \"guionista\" is that in Spanish the term has the wrong connotations since the word also used to describe people who write tour guidebooks.\n\nSince 2005, Guillermo Arriaga has been one of the patrons of DreamAgo, an international screenwriters association.\n\n"}
{"id": "1923972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923972", "title": "Taza", "text": "Taza\n\nza (, ) is a city in northern Morocco, which occupies the corridor between the Rif mountains and Middle Atlas mountains, about 120 km east of Fez and 210 km west of Oujda. It recorded a population of 148,406 in the 2019 Moroccan census and is the capital of Taza Province.\n\nHistorically Taza was known first as ' \"Ribāt Taza رباط تازة \"' , a military camp belongs to the Fatimid state , was founded by the local governor \"Mussa ibn aby Alaâfiya موسى بن أبي العافية \" who was the leader of Miknassa tribe too. Up to at least the early 20th century, Taza was considerable trading centre on the route between Fez and the Algerian frontier.\n\nTaza is located in north-central Morocco, in the south of the Rif region right outside the mountain range on a narrow plain. The city is composed of two formerly separate towns built on separate terraces overlooking a mountain valley. The old-Taza town is at an elevation of 1,919 feet (585 m) above sea level and is surrounded by fortifications; the newer town, established by the French in 1920, is located in a fertile plain at an elevation of 1,460 feet (445 m). Fossil remains indicate that caves in the area were inhabited as early as the Paleolithic Period. One of the most important caves in Morocco, Rhar Chara, is close to Taza. This cave is over 7.6 kilometres long.\n\nThe city is located in a mountain pass known as the \"Taza Gap\", where the Rif mountains and the Middle-Atlas range come together. Through this pass successive waves of invaders moved westward onto the Atlantic coastal plains of northwestern Africa. Taza was first settled by Miknasa tribesmen, who gave it its name: \"Miknasa Taza\", similar to \"Miknasa al-Zeitoun\" (present-day Meknes, another Miknasa settlement). The Almoravid empire took over Taza in 1074. They were replaced by the Almohad empire in 1132. In 1248 the city was captured by the Marinids. Although Taza barred the route of Turks from Algiers seeking conquest in what is now Morocco, it fell to the French in 1914. The old town has Berber monuments, mosques, and a 14th-century madrasa (Coranic school). Population in 1982 stood at 77,216. Population now estimated about 300,000.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa). Located along the Atlas Mountains, Taza has a seasonal climate, shifting from cool in winter to hot days in the summer months. Rainfall can reach up to 900 mm per year.\n\nThe old town's main thoroughfare is enlivened by the Grain Market and the Souks where wickerwork, tapestries, jewelry, ... The road terminates at a square doubling as a parade ground which sports the Al-Andalous Mosque. The Mosque's minaret, constructed in the 14th century, is wider at the top than at its base.\nBab el-Qebbour Street crosses the Kissaria (covered marketplace), then leads on to the Market Mosque where it meets up with Bab Jamaa gate, the main point of entry of Taza. Somewhat further south, across from Bab el-Rih, the Wind Gate, a bastion dating from the 16th century closes the ring around the kasbah. Taza's city walls, raised in the 12th century and frequently enlarged on later occasions were equipped with a Borj or fortified tower 26 metres (85 ft) wide at the base by the Saadi Ahmed el-Mansour in the 16th century. The gate with iron grate and the casemates with terraced roofs are clearly influenced by European military architecture of the time.\n\nThe topology of the area has imposed a pattern of urban spread. Viewed from above, the city takes the form of a \"T\". It has its root in Taza high and stretches north to reach the bed of the Oued Larbaâ. Since the urban stretches east and west along the N6 between Fez and Oujda.\n\nAt the dawn of independence, the city consisted of the Medina High Taza, the European district occupying almost hill called \"No Adrar Illouz. People usually pronounce Draâ louz. This area became the center of town, and finally the station area a few kilometers below.\n\nDuring the following years (60s, 70s) districts have emerged, midway between downtown and the train station (Bit Goulem, Ourida, Bin-Jradi).\n\nDuring the 80s, other districts make their appearance, especially north of the city (and Massira Al-Quds), extended and developed areas today. The goal of this extension was the slum clearance. It was a success, since 1986 the city was declared a city without slums. The craze is such that sections like (Massira II) are villa style.\n\nThe 90s marked the beginning of the urbanization of the axis center - Taza above. These are buildings with 6 or 7 floors occupying a strategic content between public facilities (municipality, space, civil protection, hospital ibn baja, high school and college ...) and on the other hand, it is down the high rock a hundred yards. This area is also adjacent to the uptown-Qessou meddah, Friouato and Hay Shuhada (developed throughout the last three decades).\n\nMore recently this area continues to morph and promises a beautiful view from the heights of the city. The planning now also spread on the road to Fez for several kilometers to reach the intermittently R508 (about Tainast).\n\nThe development plan provides a direct link between Taza West (at the \"white bridge\") and Taza high.\n\n\n"}

It took place in Athens, Greece, following Helena Paparizou's win at the 2005 contest in Kiev, Ukraine with the song \"My Number One\". It was the first time Greece had hosted the contest - 32 years after the country made its debut. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), the contest was held at the Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall, and consisted of a semi-final on 18 May, and the final on 20 May 2006. The two live shows were hosted by Maria Menounos and Sakis Rouvas.\n\nThirty-seven countries participated in the contest. Armenia took part for the first time this year. Meanwhile, Austria, Hungary, and Serbia and Montenegro announced their non-participations in the contest for various reasons. Serbia and Montenegro had intended to participate, however, due to a scandal in the national selection, tensions were caused between the Serbian broadcaster, RTS, and the Montenegrin broadcaster, RTCG. Despite of this, the nation did retain voting rights for the contest.\n\nThe winner was with the song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\", performed by Lordi and written by lead singer Mr. Lordi a.k.a. Tomi Petteri Putaansuu. This was Finland's first victory in the contest - and first top five placing - in 45 years of participation. It was the first ever hard rock song to win the contest, and Lordi was the first band to win since . Russia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania and Sweden rounded out the top five. Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved their best result in their Eurovision history. Further down the table, Lithuania also achieved their best result to date, finishing sixth. Of the \"Big Four\" countries Germany placed the highest, finishing joint fourteenth (with Norway).\n\nThe contest saw the 1,000th song performed in the contest, when Ireland's Brian Kennedy performed \"Every Song Is a Cry for Love\" in the semi-final.\nAn official CD and DVD was released and a new introduction was an official fan book released from this year, and every year to come with detailed information of every country.\n\nWhen Greece won the 2005 contest, the Head of the Greek Delegation, Fotini Yiannoulatou, said that ERT was ready to host the event in Athens the next year. However, multiple cities were bided to host the 2006 contest, including Thessaloniki and Patras, the second and the third largest city in Greece, respectively. The majors of the three cities (Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras) were said that their cities were ready to host the event. The venues that were rumored for each city were Olympic Indoor Hall for Athens, Pylea Sports Hall for Thessaloniki and Dimitris Tofalos Arena for Patras.\n\nIn the end, ERT had chosen Athens to host the event. The venue that was chosen as the host venue was the Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall, which is located in the Athens Olympic Sports Complex, in the capital city of Greece. Completed in 1995, it was the largest indoor venue in use for sporting events at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe official logo of the contest remained the same from 2004 and 2005 with the country's flag in the heart being changed. The 2006 sub-logo created by the design company Karamela for Greek television was apparently based on the Phaistos Disc which is a popular symbol of ancient Greece. According to ERT, it was \"inspired by the wind and the sea, the golden sunlight and the glow of the sand\". Following Istanbul's \"Under The Same Sky\" and Kiev's \"Awakening\", the slogan for the 2006 show was \"Feel The Rhythm\". This theme was also the basis for the postcards for the 2006 show, which emphasized Greece's historical significance as well as being a major modern tourist destination.\n\nTo save time in the final, the voting time lasted ten minutes and the voting process was changed: points 1-7 were shown immediately on-screen. The spokespersons only announced the countries scoring 8, 10 and 12 points. Despite this being intended to speed proceedings up, there were still problems during voting – EBU imaging over-rode Maria Menounos during a segment in the voting interval and some scoreboards were slow to load. The Dutch spokesperson Paul de Leeuw also caused problems, giving his mobile number to presenter Rouvas during the Dutch results, and slowing down proceedings, also by announcing the first seven points. Constantinos Christoforou (who also represented Cyprus in 1996, 2002 and 2005) saluted from \"Nicosia, the last divided capital in Europe\"; during Cyprus' reading, the telecast displayed Switzerland by mistake. This voting process has been criticized because suspense was lost by only reading three votes instead of ten. And for the first time, the display for the Macedonian entry had the title spelled out in its entirety (as \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\") instead of being abbreviated as it has been in previous years (as \"FYR Macedonia\").\n\nParticipating countries in a Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the EBU.\n\nThe semi-final was held on 18 May 2006 at 21:00 (CET). 23 countries performed and all 37 participants and Serbia and Montenegro voted.\n\n\"Shaded countries qualified for the Eurovision Final\"\nNotes\n\nThe finalists were:\n\nThe final was held on 20 May 2006 at 21:00 (CET) and was won by Finland.\n\n\"Countries in bold automatically qualified for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 Final.\"\nNotes\n\nThe following people were the spokespersons for their countries.

In the semi final, Monaco and Albania used the jury voting due to insufficient televoting numbers.

His lifetime is broadly determined to be between first century BC and 2nd century AD. His queen was Veliyan Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan Venman. Uthiyan Cheralathan was a contemporary of the Chola ruler Karikala Chola. He is praised for his elephant corps and cavalry. Present day Changanacherry end of Kuttanad was the capital of the Chera dynasty king Uthiyan Cheralathan. His descendant was Senguttavan (Chenguttavan means \"brave-hearted\" in old Tamil and his name is carried by the next towns of Chenganacherri and Chengana to the present day). According to sangam literature, Cheralathan was defeated in the Battle of Venni with Karikala Chola and the capital was burnt down. Another local legend says Kuttanad was believed to be forest with dense tree growth. This forest was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire.\n\nIt is a well known fact that burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields) until the recent past. This fact throws some light on this theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. In Kuttanad most of the place names end in kari (meaning burnt residue or charcoal). Some familiar place names are Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary, Kandanakary, Thayamkary, Chathenkary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary.\n\nThe Kuttanad region is categorised into:\n\nLower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of Ambalapuzha, Nedumudy, Kuttanadu (excluding Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar), and the northern half of Karthikapally taluk in Alappuzha district).\n\nUpper Kuttanad comprises Veeyapuram and Pallippad in Karthikapally taluk, Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar in Kuttanad taluk; Chennithala and Thripperumthura villages in Mavelikkara taluk; Mannar, Kuruttissery, Budhanoor, Ennakkad villages in Chengannur taluk of Alappuzha district; and Parumala, Kadapra, Niranam, Pulikeezhu, Nedumpuram, Chathenkary, Peringara, and Kavumbhagam villages in Pathanamthitta district.\n\nNorth Kuttanad comprises Vaikom taluk, western parts of Kottayam taluk, and western parts of Changanacherry taluk in Kottayam district.\n\nA few of the major villages which form Kuttanad are: Kainakary, Chathenkary Ramankary, Puthukkary, Chennamkary, Nedumudi, Niranam, Kaipuzha, Edathua, Mampuzhakkary, Neelamperoor, Kainady, Kavalam, Pulincunnoo, Manalady, Kannady Kayalpuram, Veliyanadu, Veeyapuram, Vezhapra, Kunnamkary, Kumaramkary, Valady, Kidangara, Mithrakary, Muttar, Neerattupuram, Thalavadi, Changankary, Champakulam, Nedumudi, Moonnatummukham, Melpadom, Pulincunnu, Pallippad, \nPayippad, Karichal, Ayaparambu, Anary, Vellamkulangara, Pilappuzha, Pandi, Edathua, Pacha, Chekkidikad, Thakazhy, Cheruthana, Karuvatta, Chennithala, Narakathara, Venattukad, Kayalppuram, Mankompu, Chathurthiakary, Koduppunna, Oorukkary, Thayankary, Thiruvarpu, Pullangadi and payattupakka, Kandankary among others.\n\nThe major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of \"The Rice Bowl of Kerala\". Three crops are grown every year now instead of the traditional practice of two crops per year . Large farming areas near Vembanad Lake were reclaimed from the lake. The history of paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the Pamba River. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called \"padasekharams\". Bailing out of water from the fields were done manually using water wheels called \"chakram\". Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines. \n\nThere were robberies in Kuttanad in earlier days, which were prohibited by the Travancore Maharajah Moolam Thirunal.\n\nThree distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using \"chakram\", which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first \"Kayal Nilams\" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake. These pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu.\n\nThe second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava Panicker. He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters. The reclaimed kayal was known as ‘ Attumuttu Kayal’. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary.\n\nThe introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. This made farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by Pallithanam Luka Mathai (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the Cherukara Kayal and Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal. But the second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on kayal reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.\n\nIn 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travancore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this scheme kayal land was notified for reclamation in blocks each named with a letter of the English alphabet. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of kayal land, 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. After the removal of the ban in 1913, Pallithanam Luca Matthai along with some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal measuring a total area 2,400 acres. This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu. C.J. Kurian, Ex MLC and Mr. John Illikalam were his main partners in this venture. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920, known as the new reclamations, were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block(Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major Kayal nilams reclaimed during this period.\n\nDuring the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N covering an area of 3600 acres were reclaimed under the leadership of Pallithanam Luca Matthai, Cunnumpurathu Kurien, Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Kunnathusseril Peious, Ettuparayil Xavier and Pattassery PP Mathai. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block Kayal covering 1,400 acres was reclaimed by the joint efforts of eight families led by then member of Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, Pallithanam Luca Matthai. His partners in the reclamation included Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Ettuparayil Xavier, Pattassery PP Mathai, Kaarikkuzhi Ponnada Vaakkaal Mathulla Mappila(E & F block), Meledom, Paruthickal and Kandakudy. Once, while the king of travancore visited the Erupathinalayiram Kayal he was pleased and told Kaarikkuzhi Mathulla Mappila that he should have bought a Ponnada to honor him.Since he has not bought a Ponnada, he presented \"Ponnada Vaakkaal\" (Ponnada by word).There after his house was known as Ponnada Vaakkaal.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1940 reclamation activity came to a halt because of a steep drop in the price of rice.\n\nDue to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated \"Grow More Food\" campaiagn and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan) & his wife's family Puthanppura Panchara(Veliyanadu).\nAs farming in the area increased, farmers felt themselves constrained by the two cycles a year for rice cultivation. The reason for which is the limited availability of potable water in Kuttanadu. During the monsoon seasons, the water from the mountains flow through the rivers to the sea, bringing potable water to Kuttanadu. But during summer, due to the low level of the region seawater enters Kuttanadu, significantly increasing the salinity of the water and making it unpotable.\n\nAlso Kuttanad is recognised as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by FAO\n\nThis project was designed as a permanent solution to the flood situation in Kuttanad. This programme was envisaged in such a way that flood waters from Pamba, Manimalayar and Achankovil were diverted to the sea before it reached Vembanad lake. The construction of the Spillway ended by 1959.\n\nIn 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund (Dam) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases, the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo. The farmers who were expecting lots of financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December–June when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon. Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad.that are chambavu and karutha charu.\n\nEven though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the bund like the omniprescence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near by.\nKuttanad assembly constituency was a part of Alappuzha. After the Lok Sabha delimitation in 2008, it now belongs to the Mavelikkara constituency.\n\n\n\nKT Rammohan. Tales of Rice: Kuttanad, Southwest India.

Together with his parents and five siblings, he immigrated to Canada and settled in Sheho, Saskatchewan. In young adulthood, he became a teacher: a career that lasted 14 years. He then studied at a seminary of the UOCC from 1941 to 1944. He was ordained into the diaconate on September 27, 1944 and shortly thereafter into the priesthood on October 1. As a priest, he served parishes in Manitoba and Ontario. In 1951, he arrived in Hamilton, Ontario to serve the parish of St. Vladimir. He served this parish for 29 years, seeing the parish grow from 47 to 500 families.\n\nHis wife, Paraskeviya Tymofij, whom he married in 1932, died in April 1976. Two years later, an Extraordinary Sobor (general council) of the UOCC elected him as its candidate for bishop. On July 16, 1978, he was consecrated as the Bishop of Saskatoon at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Winnipeg by Metropolitan Andrew (Metiuk)of Winnipeg, Archbishop Borys (Yakovkevych), and Bishop Mykolai (Debryn)]of Toronto. Following the death of then Archbishop Mykolai in 1981, Bishop Wasyly became the acting Bishop of the Eastern Eparchy. He was elevated to Archbishop of Toronto in 1983. Then in 1985, the 17th Sobor of the UOCC selected Wasyly to be its Metropolitan and Primate with the honorific \"His Beatitude\" (because he was the head of his own church. After the UOCC joined the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Metropolitans are now addressed as His Eminence), and he will be the last Hierarch (bishop) to hold that title in the UOCC, as decided by Patriarch Bartholemew I. As Primate, he was the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and Chancellor of its seminary, St. Andrew's College.\n\nUnder the leadership of Metropolitan Wasyly, the UOCC came into full communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1990. In 1993, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nMetropolitan Wasyly reposed on January 10, 2005. His funeral took place on January 21–22 at Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg. He is buried at Glen Eden Cemetery. With his wife Parskeviya, he had three sons: Eugene (who has served on the church's Consistory board twice), Yaroslaw and Emil.\n\n"}

The title is the motto of the British Army’s elite Special Air Service (SAS).\n\nThe plot is based largely on the Iranian Embassy siege of 1980, when a team from the SAS made a sudden assault on the building to rescue those being held hostage inside. As producer, Euan Lloyd was inspired to make the film by visiting the scene during the siege and watching live coverage of it on television, moving quickly to prevent someone else developing the same idea. An initial synopsis was created by George Markstein. This was then turned into a novel by James Follett, as \"The Tiptoe Boys\", in 30 days. Meanwhile, chapter-by-chapter as the novel was completed, it was posted to Reginald Rose in Los Angeles, who wrote the final screenplay. The film was released in the US as \"The Final Option\".\n\nA demonstration by unilateral nuclear disarmament protesters from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in London is interrupted when one of the protesters is violently killed. British security forces learn that a terrorist group attached to CND has been planning a significant act of terrorism for the near future. The person killed during the protest demonstration was an undercover intelligence officer who had infiltrated the terrorist group. The commanding officer of the Special Air Service, Colonel Hadley, suggests a new line of inquiry for the investigation.\n\nTwo foreign officers arrive to train at the SAS's headquarters: Captain Hagen is a member of the US Army Rangers and Captain Freund is a member of the West German GSG 9. They are taken to the close quarter battle house and witness an SAS room entry assault. Colonel Hadley introduces them to the SAS man playing the hostage, Captain Peter Skellen, and informs them they will be with Skellen's troop, consisting of Baker, Dennis, and Williamson. During an exercise in the Brecon Beacons, Hadley and Major Steele discover Skellen's troop torturing Hagen and Freund. Skellen is dismissed from the Regiment. The torture and dismissal are a ruse to repaint Skellen as a disgraced former SAS operative, and Hagen and Freund as innocent victims in the scheme.\n\nSkellen's intelligence contact, Ryan, advises him to meet Frankie Leith and Rod Walker, the two people who lead the People's Lobby (PL), the terrorist group believed to be planning the act of terrorism. Skellen tells his wife that he will be going away for a while on a mission. A foreign man, Malik, arranges with a city banker for the distribution of large sums of money to various left organisations, including the PL. Skellen arranges to meet Leith at a bar frequented by PL members and initiates a romantic relationship with her, to the annoyance of Walker and his cohorts Helga and Mac. Leith takes Skellen to the organisation's offices and introduces him to the group. Leith appreciates Skellen's SAS background, and offers him a job as security consultant to the PL; she also allows him to move in with her. To strengthen Skellen's cover story, Hadley informs Hagen and Freund of Skellen's location; the wronged men attack Skellen at Leith's home and inflict a severe beating. As a result, Leith's few remaining doubts about Skellen vapourise, but Walker and his cronies still are not fully convinced. Helga observes Skellen meeting the same unknown individual (Ryan) in various locations. Their scrutiny intensifies when Walker and his associates witness Skellen's meeting with his wife and daughter. They use photos from their surveillance to convince Leith that Skellen is not all he seems. Walker orders Helga to kill Ryan, cutting Skellen's link to Hadley. Hadley has no choice but to trust Skellen's abilities to uncover the group's plans and escape alive. He orders police protection for Skellen's family.\n\nDespite his official advisory capacity, Skellen is denied details about the upcoming PL operation. On the day of the operation, Leith and Walker instruct Helga and Mac to take Skellen's family hostage. Leith uses this to blackmail Skellen into unconditional co-operation.\n\nThe terrorists and Skellen arrive at the US Embassy in a hijacked coach. Wearing stolen US Air Force uniforms, they gain entry to the secure compound and take hostages of the US Ambassador, US Secretary of State, US Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command, and British Foreign Secretary, along with their wives and the embassy staff. Hadley and his police counterpart, Commander Powell, arrive at the Embassy to receive the demands of the terrorists: unless a US nuclear missile is launched at Holy Loch naval base, all the hostages will be killed. Currie questions Leith's motivations, and Leith responds that her ultimate goal is the disarmament of the whole world. This opens a debate about method and political philosophy that only antagonizes the terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, Dennis and three fellow SAS troopers arrive at Skellen's home. They set up in the attached house next door, using sensing devices to covertly observe Helga, Mac, and their captives through the wall.\n\nSkellen manages to separate himself from the group by feigning a need for the toilet. He uses a shaving mirror to heliograph floodlights and signal Hadley via Morse code, telling him to attack at 10 a.m. while Skellen creates a diversion. Hadley cannot get permission for an SAS attack because the British Home Secretary insists that Powell resolve the situation through negotiation. As the tension mounts inside the embassy, a mistake by one of the terrorists causes the death of the SAC C-in-C. This enables Powell and Hadley to get the permission for their assault.\n\nThe SAS operatives in the house adjoining Skellen's remove a large area of the bricks separating the attached houses. Meanwhile, Helga's temper at the Skellen's crying baby escalates into a fight with Skellen's wife. The operatives work fast to attach a charge to the exposed wall, cut the lights and blow the wall so two SAS soldiers can shoot through the gap and kill both Helga and Mac.\n\nAs the SAS mount an assault on the embassy, the terrorists panic. Skellen overpowers and kills three terrorists. The SAS, deploying from helicopters, force open doors and enter through windows. As they methodically clear the embassy, Skellen kills more terrorists including Walker. Skellen joins with Baker and his troop to search for Leith, as the other troopers bundle the hostages to safety. When Skellen hesitates to kill Leith on sight, Major Steele kills her before she can kill Skellen.\n\nThe ambassador thanks the troopers as they leave the embassy. Skellen and his troop apologise to Hagen and Freund, explain the reason for their actions, and make peace. Skellen departs on one of the helicopters with his colleagues.\n\nIn a government building, Sir Richard, a politician, complains to a colleague about the violent end to the siege. He then meets the financier Malik, and they discuss future similar actions.\n\nAn on-screen list of notable terrorist incidents appears over the closing credits, accompanied by a rendition of \"The Red Flag\".\n\n\nEuan Lloyd gained the idea for the film from events surrounding the siege of the Iranian embassy in London, most notably the storming of the building on 5 May 1980 by the SAS. Living just half a mile from the embassy, he visited it on multiple occasions during the four days it was occupied by terrorists, witnessing the dramatic ending to the siege in person. That same evening he called his lawyer in New York and asked him to register 5 titles with the Motion Picture Association of America, one of which was \"SAS: Who Dares Wins\". In a slightly abbreviated form, this became the name of the film based on the incident which he then set out to make.\n\n\"Since John Wayne and Jack Warner have left the scene its become unfashionable to wave the flag\", said Lloyd. He hoped the film would counterbalance the anti-authority message of films like \"The China Syndrome\", \"War Games\", \"Missing\" and \"Gandhi\".\n\n\"I watched in awe at what these SAS men did, and truly I felt very proud\", Lloyd said. \"Terrorism worries me greatly, so here was an opportunity for me to say what I've felt for a long time.\"\n\nLloyd contacted friend, writer and former intelligence officer, George Markstein and commissioned a treatment. They decided to end the film with an embassy siege, but to make the film more relevant to US audiences they changed it to the US embassy. They also changed Iranian extremists to anti-nuclear protesters. Markstein wrote a treatment in a week, then Lloyd gave the job of writing a script to Reginald Rose. The budget was raised by pre-selling the film to various territories.\n\nLloyd's investors were willing to go with a lesser name actor as star. The producer considered a number of options before going with Lewis Collins, then best known for \"The Professionals\" TV show. Collins trained intensively for the part.\n\nJudy Davis was cast on the strength of her performance in \"My Brilliant Career\". She said she did not base her character on Patty Hearst as she felt Hearst was ultimately not serious about politics; she was inspired by Bommi Baumann and his book \"Terror or love?\".\n\nFilming began in September 1981. The film had a number of advisers who had worked in the SAS which led to some concerns from the Ministry of Defence that the film could breach the Official Secrets Act. However Lloyd says the ministry eventually gave its \"tacit approval\" to the film after two small changes to the story were made; \"after that they opened the door quite widely and even provided three military helicopters\", the producer said.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, the film was made with the help of the 22 SAS Regiment at Hereford, although their commanding officer Peter de la Billière had initially refused to help in a pre-production meeting with Euan Lloyd. Director Ian Sharp, who was hired due to Lloyd's liking of his direction in the TV series \"The Professionals\", was invited to SAS headquarters at Stirling Lines where he met some of the troops who assaulted the Iranian embassy. With the co-operation of the SAS achieved, production moved ahead swiftly.\n\nDuring one of his visits to Stirling Lines, Sharp had met a Fijian trooper who had a mishap during the Iranian embassy assault. The trooper told how he got caught up in his descent and his uniform caught fire due to the explosives used for their forced entry. Inspired by this, Sharp had a similar scene inserted.\n\nThe first scenes were shot in Portobello Road market in January 1982. The concert, speech and subsequent fight were staged at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. Skellen's house and the hostage taking was shot in Kynance Mews in South Kensington.\n\nWhen it came time to shoot the SAS assault on the US embassy, the crew had prepared the helicopters and stuntmen but the SAS offered to do the scene instead. Sharp accepted as he thought the look they gave could not be replicated by the crew.\n\nThe action sequences were arranged by veteran James Bond stuntman Bob Simmons.\n\n\"The film isn't a serious psychological study of a terrorism but it has been a good meaty part\", said Judy Davis.\n\nFilming wrapped after seven weeks. Lloyd started to organise the publicity campaign, but like his previous film \"The Wild Geese\", rumour had started to spread that the film was a right-wing propaganda film attacking the CND organisation.\n\nThe score was composed by Roy Budd, while the song \"Right on Time\", which is heard during the church scene was written by Jerry and Marc Donahue.\n\nThe film was the sixth-highest grosser at the UK box office in 1982. (Another source put it 10th highest.)\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" said: \"There are so many errors of judgment, strategy, behavior and simple plausibility in this movie that we just give up and wait for it to end. You know you're in trouble when the movie's audience knows more about terrorism than the terrorists do.\"\n\"Who Dares Wins\" was panned by some critics as being right-wing. \"Sight & Sound\" described the film as \"hawkish\". Derek Malcolm in \"The Guardian\" called the film \"truly dreadful\".\n\n\"The Washington Post\" enjoyed the final assault, describing it as \"a pip\", and praised the authenticity of the action sequences, but thought \"an awful lot of talky, slack footage accumulates before this whirlwind payoff\" and that the \"storytelling rhythm is defective.\"\n\nWithin days of the film's release, producer Lloyd received a phone call from Stanley Kubrick saying how much he enjoyed the film, in particular the performance of Judy Davis. However, this praise has been disputed by Kubrick's assistant Anthony Frewin, saying that, \"Lloyd, as the gunnery [sergeant] in \"Full Metal Jacket\" would say, is blowing smoke up our asses. That film is the antithesis of everything Stanley stood for and believed in.\"\n\nSoon after the film was completed, copies of it were requested for viewing by the White House; it was seen by Ronald Reagan and his advisers at Camp David and they reportedly enjoyed the film. It was also enjoyed by Alexander Haig, Reagan's former Secretary of State, who had recently joined the board of MGM/UA. On his recommendation, MGM/UA bought the film for distribution in the US, retitling it \"The Final Option\".\n\nIn an interview, Haig praised the film as a \"terribly exciting drama... a realistic portrayal of the world in which we live.\" \n\nEuan Lloyd signed Lewis Collins to a three-picture contract on the basis of his performance. The films were to be \"The Wild Geese 2\", \"Battle for the Falklands\" (about the Special Boat Service during the Falklands war) and \"Macau\". Collins ended up not appearing in the first film and the other two were never made.\n\n"}

{"id": "1924018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1924018", "title": "Rajang River", "text": "Rajang River\n\nThe Rajang River () is a river in Sarawak, Malaysia. The river is located in northwest of Borneo. The river originates in the Iran Mountains, flows through Kapit, and then towards the South China Sea. At approximately of total length, it is the 4th longest river in Borneo, and the longest river in Malaysia.\n\nSome of the important tributaries are the Balui River, Katibas River, Ngemah River, Iran River, Pila River, Balleh River, Bangkit River and the Kanowit River.\n\nMalaysia's largest and tallest (160m) hydro electric project, Bakun Hydro Electric Dam Project, is located on narrow Bakun Fall of Balui River.\n\nIn Sarawakian Malay, the main river is named \"Batang\" (meaning \"trunk\" or \"tree\" in Malay) as it is the main larger stream as they took \"root\" in from its tributary rivers which is known as \"Sungai\" (\"river\" proper in Sarawakian Malay) and branches out again at the delta. For example, Rajang River is known as \"Batang Rajang\" and Balleh River is known as \"Sungai Balleh\" in Malay. However, Standard Malay makes no differentiation in this regard.\n\nFor upriver areas, such as the areas surrounding the headwaters, the place is named as \"Ulu\" (which means \"upriver\") or \"Hulu\" in Malay. For example, \"Hulu Rajang\" is the upriver part of the Rajang river. For bazaars along the river that are too small to call towns, they are named as \"Nanga\" in the Iban language, which is located at the point which the tributaries join the main river. Examples of Nangas are: Nanga Ngemah, Nanga Dap, and Nanga Poi. In Iban language, \"Nanga\" means \"longhouse\" and it is often followed by the name of the river that they are next to. There are also certain longhouses that use \"Rumah\" (meaning \"house\" in Malay). It often follows the name of the headman. If the headman changed, then the name of the longhouse also changed. \"Long\" meaning \"confluence\" is used by the Orang Ulu (upriver people). It is used to name the places located at the confluence between the smaller tributaries and the major river, same way as the Malay usage of the name \"Kuala\" (meaning river delta).\n\nAmongst the Chinese in Sibu, the Rajang River also nicknamed as the \"Swan River\" (鹅江). This came from a legend where famine in Sibu ended when a flock of swans flew through the skies of Sibu. There is another story where the Sibu Chinese immigrants regarded Sibu Melanau people as \"Go\" people because a staple food of Melanau staple food was \"Sago\". Coincidentally, \"Go\" pronunciation is similar to Hokkien pronunciation of \"Swan\". This reminded Sibu Chinese immigrants of \"Swan River\" back in Fuzhou, China.\n\nThe Rajang river is the longest river system in Malaysia, measuring . Its headwaters is located in the Nieuwenhuis mountains where it forms the political boundary between Malaysia and Indonesia. There is more than of rain fall each year on the Nieuwenhuis mountain range, which forms the headwaters of Rajang. The river flows from northeast to southwest. The Punan Bah people are staying at the headwaters of the Rajang. One of the Rajang tributaries, the Balui River, flows northwest into the lands of the Kayan people and Kenyah people. There is also a great bend of the Rajang river in this region. At the western end of the great bend lies the Belaga District. Going further downstream is the Pelagus Rapids where the Iban people dominates. The Pelagus Rapids is located at from the Rajang river mouth. As Balleh River join into the Rajang river, the river become broader and deeper. The broader part of the Rajang river hosted about 25% of the people of Sarawak. At from the river mouth, the river started to flow from east to west. At this turning point, there is a town known as Kapit. Kapit is the last stop of express boats coming from Sibu. The town of Kapit is inhabited by the Chinese, Iban, and Kayan people.\n\nFurther downriver are the smaller towns such as Song which is located at the mouth of the Katibas River. At about from the sea, there are Mixed Zone Lands. These lands can be owned both the Chinese and the Iban people. The lands are divided into parcels measuring several acres, where smallholders clear the land for agricultural activities. In the midst of these Mixed Zone Lands at miles from the sea, there is a town named Kanowit. The river near Kanowit is wide.\n\nThe biggest town by the river is Sibu, some upriver from the mouth of the Rajang. It can be reached by ocean-going vessels. Sibu is the political, economic, cultural, and education centre of the central region of Sarawak. Other towns which are located further downriver are Sarikei and Bintangor. These two towns are mainly settled by the Chinese. Tanjung Manis District is located near the Rajang River delta where the Malay and Melanau people dominates. Bruit Island is situated inside the Rajang delta, with a light house at the Sirik Point.\n\nThe population of the Rajang River was very low in the 19th century during the Bruneian Empire. The natives living along the river traded several forest products with Malay traders from Brunei. At that time, the Melanau, Kanowit, and Rajang ethnic groups were living downriver; Bhuket, Punan Bah, Lugat, Sihan, and Kejaman ethnic groups lived at the middle section of the river; and with Penan and Seping living in the upriver area. After the 19th century, the Kayan and Kenyah migrated to the Balui river from the present day Indonesian Kalimantan. Meanwhile, the Iban people migrated from the West Kalimantan to the lower Rajang valley while conducting shifting cultivation. With introduction of new tribes in the Rajang basin, inter-ethnic battles became rife. Some ethnic groups fled to Balingian and Tatau rivers to avoid the conflict.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Brooke government started to construct forts along the Rajang River in order to ensure political stability in the Rajang basin. The Chinese then started to move inland and settle near the forts and trade various forest products with the natives. In 1884, Belaga fort and trading market was constructed. It soon became the political and economic centre of the district. Subsequently, government offices, schools, a bank, a police station, a mosque, and churches were built around the fort. In 1997, Bakun Dam construction was started at the upper Balui River. Many longhouses and villages in this area was resettled at the Sungai Asap resettlement scheme. Sungai Asap is connected to Bakun Dam through the Bakun road.\n\nDuring Sarawak Communist Insurgency, Sarawak government set up the \"Rajang Special Security Area\" on 25 March 1973. A day later, Rajang Security Command (RASCOM) was formed as a result of co-operation of civil, military, and police command headquarters. These measures were taken to clamp down communist activities in the Rajang delta.\n\nOn 6 October 2010, heavy rain have caused a massive landslide that brought logs and debris down into the Balleh river, tributaries above Kapit, and then into the Rajang river. It was estimated that the volume of the logs and debris had exceeded 300, 000 m. This logjam had also affected the Igan river. The log debris, stretching 50 km long, had reached Sibu on 8 October. The logjam had caused transportation difficulties for the people living alongside the river and dead fish were also seen on the river. As on 2 November 2012, Global Witness revealed that the logging operation of Interglobal Empire, a subsidiary of WTK group of companies, in the logging concession T/3476 was responsible for the landslide into Melatai River which subsequently blocked the Rajang River. Similar logjam recurred in early 2017 at the upper reaches of the Balui river.\n\nA total of 30 species of mammals are recorded along the Rajang basin in 2004. The mouth of the river is the only place where the dolphins can be sighted. Totally protected mammals include gibbon, langurs, black giant squirrel, slow loris, and tarsier. Civets, otters, bats, treeshrew, and primates are also included under Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998. Wild pigs and deers are the most frequently hunted animals by the locals while primates can be hunted incidentally.\n\n122 species of birds were sighted along the Rajang basin in 2004. 21 species were recorded along the mouth of the river while 96 species were recorded in Hose Mountains and 88 species at Lanjak Entimau which are located in the interior of Sarawak. The only endemic species of birds located at Rajang basin is Dusky munia which is found abundantly in paddy fields. Other species of birds which are commonly found along the Rajang basin are: Pacific swallow, Little spiderhunter, and Asian glossy starling. 20 species of birds (mainly eagles, egret, kingfishers, woodpeckers) are protected while 7 species of birds (mainly Hornbill and Pheasant) are totally protected under the Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998.\n\nA total of 164 fish species has been recorded at the Rajang basin in 2005. Empurau (\"Tor tambroides\") and Semah (\"Tor douronensis\") fish are considered popular fishes among the locals. Empurau fish is still found breeding near the upper tributaries of Rajang such as Balleh River and near the Bakun Dam.\n\nThe major economic activity in the upper reaches of the Rajang River is logging. Among the type of wood that are extracted for exports are: Ramin, plywood, Kapur, Meranti, Keruing, and Belian. Rice is the dominant crop among the middle part of the Rajang river. Trading of \"Engkabang\" fruits was prevalent in the 1970s. Other agricultural activities in the Rajang basin are: rubber and pepper cultivation, poultry domestication, and vegetables planting.\n\nRajang Port Authority (RPA) is the main regulatory body to coordinate the trade activities of all the five river ports along the Rajang river. RPA serves to provide maintenance, adequate and efficient port services for all users of the ports. It is located at the Sibu port operation centre Sibu and Sungai Merah can be assessed via a shorter route through Paloh river where the distances from the mouth of the river can be shortened to 82 km and 92 km respectively. In the year 2012, RPA recorded a total revenue of RM 30.1 million although its total cargo throughput went down from 5.0 million to 3.2 million tonnes from the previous year. The 5 river ports along the Rajang river (arranged by their distances from the river mouth) are:\n\n\nPandaw River Cruise was started on 1 July 2009 in order to boost tourism activities along the Rajang River. It was a nine-day cruising starting from Express Wharf Terminal of Sibu to Pelagus Rapids Resort in Kapit. The tourists can go hiking and visiting long houses and towns during the ride. However, this programme has been terminated in March 2012 because of logistical and operational difficulties. During 2017 Visit Sibu Year, longhouse visits along the Rajang River was promoted as an ecotourism product. Crocodiles which are living by the river banks became the mascot for the event.\n\nThe town of Sibu can be assessed by oceangoing vessels for 80 miles (130 km) while an additional 100 miles (160 km) of the river can be assessed by shallow-draft craft. The remaining parts of the river which leads into the Sarawak interior can only be assessed by small canoes. Speedboats and longboats are the major form of transport between Kapit and Belaga. Transportation above Belaga to Balui River requires longboats. Rajang River also serves to transport logs down the river. Some areas in the interior are only accessible through river during the monsoon season. Meanwhile, for the towns located at the downriver, market merchants have to take care of their own belongings from being flooded.\n\nLogging operations are rampant on the upstream of Rajang river. A major study conducted along the Rajang river from May to December 2004 found out that the main channel of the Rajang river was turbid except for smaller tributaries. The water transparency was about 4 cm to 5 cm at that time. Based on Taxonomic richness index, the stretch of upstream river between Kanowit and Belaga river is recovering from logging 15 to 20 years ago with the exception of Penaan river because the local community uses toxic chemicals to capture fish. The stretch of river downstream from Lebaan to Selalang river is considered unclean.\n\n"}

It is also found in Lake Baikal. It normally inhabits slow-moving freshwater habitats, particularly lakes and lowland rivers. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the tench is called \"Schlei\".\n\nThe tench is most often found in still waters with a clay or muddy substrate and abundant vegetation. This species is rare in clear waters across stony substrate, and is absent altogether from fast-flowing streams. It tolerates water with a low oxygen concentration, being found in waters where even the carp cannot survive.\nTench feed mostly at night with a preference for animals, such as chironomids, on the bottom of eutrophic waters and snails and pea clams in well-vegetated waters.\n\nBreeding takes place in shallow water usually among aquatic plants where the sticky green eggs can be deposited. Spawning usually occurs in summer, and as many as 300,000 eggs may be produced. Growth is rapid, and fish may reach a weight of 0.11 kg (0.25 lb) within the first year.\n\nTench have a stocky, carp-like shape and olive-green skin, darker above and almost golden below. The tail fin is square in shape. The other fins are distinctly rounded in shape. The mouth is rather narrow and provided at each corner with a very small barbel. Maximum size is 70 cm, though most specimens are much smaller. A record fish caught in 2001 in England had a weight of 15 lb 3 oz (6.89 kg). The eyes are small and red-orange in colour. Sexual dimorphism is absent or weak, limited to the adult females having a more convex ventral profile when compared with males.\n\nMales may also possess a very thick and flattened outer ray to the ventral fins. Males are generally smaller than females, but can be recognised by having more curved lower fins and noticeable muscles around the base of the fins generally absent in female.\n\nThe tench has very small scales, which are deeply embedded in a thick skin, making it as slippery as an eel. Folklore has it that this slime cured any sick fish that rubbed against it, and from this belief arose the name doctor fish.\n\nAn artificially bred variety of tench called the golden tench is a popular ornamental fish for ponds. This form varies in colour from pale gold through to dark red, and some fish have black or red spots on the flanks and fins. Though somewhat similar to the goldfish, because these fish have such small scales, their quality is rather different.\n\nTench are edible, working well in recipes that would otherwise call for carp, but are rarely eaten these days. They are shoaling fish that are popular quarries for coarse angling in rivers, lakes and canals. Tench, particularly golden tench, are also kept as ornamental fish in ponds as they are bottom feeders that help to keep the waterways clean and healthy.\n\nLarge tench may be found in gravel pits or deep, slow-moving waters with a clayey or silty bottom and copious aquatic vegetation. The best methods and bait to catch tench are float fishing and legering with a swim feeder using maggots, sweetcorn, pellets, bread, and worms. Fish over 1 kg (2 lb) in weight are very strong fighters when caught on a rod.\n"}

They live in cracks in the rock where water seeps down. The water contains dissolved carbon dioxide (CO) which the organisms use for their carbon needs. They have been detected in rocks down to depths of nearly three km, where the temperature is approximately 75 °C.\n\nTerrestrial Lithophiles can be found in canyons primarily composed of granite, an igneous rock, and soils saturated with fractured rock. Organisms from the genus \"Elliptochloris\", a subaerial photosynthetic green algae, demonstrate lithophilic preferences through colonization in granite cracks and in proximity to terrestrial lichens. Lithophilic lichens from the genus \"Collema\" form tight symbiotic relationships between fungi and photosynthetic algae such as \"Elliptochloris\" in order to produce necessary saturated fatty acid secondary metabolites. Lithophilic algal species colonizing fractured rock outcroppings individually exhibit coccal morphological shape while aggregating into an elliptical or globular arrangement during adulthood.\n\nLithobiontic Ecological Niches further classify lithophiles into sub-categories determined by their spatial niche specificity. The term, Lithic, refers to an association with rock and can be further explained by the term, lithobiontic, regarded as organisms living both on, and within rock surfaces. Sub-surface rock organisms, endoliths, primarily exhibit niche preference within fissures, cavities, or tunnels of various rocks. While many endoliths degrade and effectively excavate the available carbonate rock surface, many are preyed upon by select gastropod, and echinoderm species. This habitat preference can be further threatened by suspension feeding organisms searching for acquired shelter.\n"}

The acquisition was completed as of July 29, 2016.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, Ningbo Semiconductor International Corporation was jointly established by China IC Capital (the wholly owned investment fund of SMIC), Ningbo Senson Electronics Technology Co., Ltd, and Beijing Integrated Circuit Design and Testing Fund with a registered capital of RMB355 million, equal to US$52.8 million. SMIC holds 66.76% of the ownership interest. NSI will develop analog and specialty semiconductor process technology platforms in the areas of high-voltage analog, radio frequency, and optoelectronics. These developments will support customers in IC design and product development for applications in smart home, industrial, and automotive electronics, new generations of radio communications, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and other specialty systems.\n\nSMIC is expected to start mass production of 14 nm FinFET in the first half of 2019. Analysts report that SMIC 14 nm capacity will be relatively small when compared to the industry leaders, all of whom run multiple leading-edge fabs. SMIC currently has two fabs that can process 300 mm wafers using 28 nm and larger fabrication processes. The same fabs will be used for 14 nm projects too, but given their capacities and SMIC’s very high fab utilization rate (94.1% in Q2 2018), do not expect them to make loads of 14 nm SoCs. And for these reasons, along with prepping 14nm for its current fabs, the company is building a $10 billion fab that will be used for 14 nm, and is aimed at better serving local players.\n\nIn 2018, SMIC had gross profits of $747 million and net profits of $149, with $3.6 billion in revenues. It apparently spend around $550 million on research and development, or about 16 percent of sales. On May 18, 2018, ground was broken on the manufacturing base for SMIC in Shaoxing. SMIC waas building a plant that would be the first in China to use 14-nanometer production technology. The company said it would increase its investment capacity by 20% in February of 2019.\n\nCurrent co-CEOs are Zhao Haijun and Mong Song Liang. Zixue Zhou serves as chairman of the board. In May 2019, it was said that SMIC's co-chiefs, Zhao Haijun and Liang Mong-song were at odds over how to focus the company.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, SMIC announced it would voluntarily delist from the NYSE, citing low trade volumes. Along with low US trading volumes, the company named the high administrative cost of maintaining the NYSE listing. It had joined the exchange 14 years before. In June 2019, SMIC was listed for American investors on the OTCQX Best Market.\n\nOn August 16, 2019, SMIC announced it will begin 14nm FinFET volume production by the end of 2019. And SMIC received an EUV step-and-scan system from ASML that was acquired for $120 million in 2018. On November 14, 2019, SMIC announced its 14 nm FinFET had begun volume production. \n\nIn 2019, Qualcomm, Huawei, and imec were still minority shareholders in SMIC's R&D arm.\n\nThe company was the target of a lawsuit brought by TSMC, accusing SMIC of misappropriating TSMC intellectual property. The first round of litigation ended in 2005 with a $175 million settlement. A second round was opened in 2006. The liability phase of the lawsuit began on September 9, 2009 in Oakland, California, and the jury found SMIC liable on 61 out of 65 claims.\n\nSMIC entered into a settlement agreement with TSMC to resolve all pending lawsuits between the parties, including the legal action filed by TSMC in California for which a verdict was returned by the jury against SMIC on November 4, 2009 and the legal action filed by SMIC in Beijing. SMIC and TSMC have entered into a settlement agreement on November 9, 2009 to settle and dismiss the California case, including all claims and defenses of SMIC yet to be decided in that case and SMIC's appeal in the Beijing case, thus concluding all pending court litigation between the parties.\n\nKey provisions of the settlement include a mutual release of all claims that were or could have been brought in the pending lawsuits; termination of SMIC's obligation to make remaining payments under the prior settlement agreement between the parties (approximately US$40 million); payment to TSMC of an aggregate of US$200 million; and a grant to TSMC of approximately 8% of SMIC's issued share capital and a warrant which would allow TSMC to obtain total ownership of approximately 10% of SMIC's issued share capital.\n\nSMIC has customer service and marketing offices in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Taiwan, and a representative office in Hong Kong. It has manufacturing facilities at the following locations: \n\n"}
{"id": "1924053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1924053", "title": "Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs", "text": "Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\n\nThe Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is a constituent of the apocryphal scriptures connected with the Bible. It is believed to be a pseudepigraphical work comprising the dying commands of the twelve sons of Jacob. It is part of the Oskan Armenian Orthodox Bible of 1666. Fragments of similar writings were found at Qumran, but opinions are divided as to whether these are the same texts. It is generally considered apocalyptic literature.\n\nThe Testaments were written in Hebrew or Greek, and reached their final form in the 2nd century CE. In the 13th century they were introduced into the Western world through the agency of Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, whose Latin translation of the work immediately became popular. He believed that it was a genuine work of the twelve sons of Jacob, and that the Christian interpolations were a genuine product of Jewish prophecy; he accused Jews of concealing the Testaments \"on account of the prophecies of the Saviour contained in them.\"\n\nWith the critical methods of the 16th century, Grosseteste's view of the Testaments was rejected, and the book was disparaged as a mere Christian forgery for nearly four centuries. Presently, scholarly opinions are still divided as to whether it is an originally Jewish document that has been retouched by Christians, or a Christian document written originally in Greek but based on some earlier Semitic-language material. Scholarship tends to focus on this book as a Christian work, whether or not it has a Jewish predecessor (\"Vorlage\").\n\nTestaments are regarded as exhortatory writings; ethics therefore are fundamental to the text. The Testaments have many different ethical motifs, the foremost of which is adhering to God's commandments. In this regard, the ethics in the Testaments generally start out very precise; each testament discusses a certain vice or virtue. Usually this is then concluded with a very vague and general reference to God's law and commandments.\n\nAnother theme that has been extensively discussed by Hollander is the role that Joseph plays in the ethics. He is often the example of an ethical man, and the deeds of the patriarchs are often weighed against those of Joseph.\n\nAs argued by Robert Henry Charles, who studied and translated the Testaments in the beginning of the 20th century,\n\nthe main, the overwhelming value of the book lies ... in its ethical teaching, which has achieved a real immortality by influencing the thoughts and diction of the writers of the New Testament, and even those of our Lord.\n\nHe writes that the Testaments help to \"bridge the chasm that divides the ethics of the Old and New Testaments.\" To a modern reader, the main value of the Testaments, is not in the ranting variations on biblical text, but in their ethical teachings, as amplified by the following citations:\n(from \"The Apocrypha in English\". Edited by Rev. R. H. Charles.)\n\nThe work is divided into twelve books, each purporting to be the last exhortations of one of the twelve titular patriarchs. In each, the patriarch first narrates his own life, focusing on his strengths, virtues, or his sins, using biographical material from both the Hebrew Bible and Jewish tradition. Next he exhorts his listeners to emulate the one and to avoid the other. Most of the books conclude with prophetic visions.\n\nThe \"Testament of Reuben\" is predominantly concerned with admonishing lust, and the sinfulness of Reuben in his having had sex with Bilhah, a concubine of his father. It is likely that the author wished to cover the topic of fornication anyway, and assigned it for Reuben to discuss due to Reuben's relationship with Bilhah being recounted in the canonical Bible.\n\nThe \"Testament\" adds that Reuben spies Bilhah as she bathes in secret; and that when she later becomes drunk, Reuben rapes her. That trope derives from a reading of Genesis 49:4, \"wanton as water\", as \"wanton \"in\" water\", taken from the Book of Jubilees. This theme is also in 2 Samuel 11:2's account of David and Bathsheba.\n\nThe \"Testament\" portrays women as the cause of the downfall of the Watcher, and of man in general (excepting Bilhah, in accordance with \"Jubilees\"). Joseph is on the other hand portrayed as the ideal, for his resistance against Potiphar's wife.\n\nThe \"Testament of Simeon\" is primarily a diatribe against envy. In the Genesis narrative, Simeon is portrayed as having been bound in chains by Joseph, and the author of the Testament argues that Simeon had wanted to kill Joseph due to jealousy, allowing the Testament to continue with a discourse about envy. The narrative of the Testament explains that it was Judah who had sold Joseph into slavery, and goes on to portray Joseph as the ideal of virtue and generosity.\n\nThe \"Testament\" 5:4-6 in an aside attacks Simeon's children for the sin of miscegenation, Numbers 25. It does not mention the attack on Shechem, which in the Torah Simeon had mounted alongside brother Levi. Instead it posits that Simeon made war against Levi. Kugel concludes that the \"Testament\" agreed with \"Jubilees\" 30:23 in that the attack on Shechem was \"righteous\", and so the \"Testament\" suppressed the account to deny Simeon credit.\n\nThe \"Testament of Levi\" is an apocalyptic section. It is one of the longest of the Testaments, and is predominantly concerned with arrogance. Taking the theme of the Levite priesthood, the Testament explains how Levi's descendants corrupted the office by their arrogant disregard for the proper regulations.\n\nChapter 2-8 involves Levi being taken to heaven and promised the priesthood forever, and then seven angels physically give him the insignia of the priesthood (as described in Exodus). This part parallels the beginning and end of a vision in the \"Aramaic Levi Document\", whence the body of the vision is now lost; and is thought to preserve that part of the text.\n\nIn chapters 14-18 Levi cites a \"book of Enoch\", describing the sins of his descendants, with the promise that at the end there will be a glorious priest who will restore the righteousness of his office. The tropes of Levi's \"Book\" match those of the \"Apocalypse of Weeks\" in 1 Enoch.\n\nThe \"Testament\" has an account of the raid on Shechem. Its take is that Jacob proposed a marriage between Shechem and Dinah, sincerely offering Shechem the option of circumcision. Levi opposed the circumcision from the start. Unlike \"Jubilees\" and, if Kugel is right, the \"Testament of Simeon\": to the \"Testament of Levi\", intermarriage is lawful in principle between Israelites and converts. Shechem was excluded for its other crimes.\n\nOne way in which this testament is distinguished from the others is by additional footnotes in a Greek version of the manuscript from Mount Athos. These footnotes were found to be translated from a non-apocalyptic precursor of the text in Aramaic, partially preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The find consisted of six fragments in two manuscripts from cave 4 (4Q213-214). A small related fragment was also found in cave 1 (1Q21). According to some sources, these scrolls were dated by the Oriental Institute to between 100-200 BC using Radiocarbon dating.\n\nAccording to James Kugel at Bar-Ilan University, Aramaic Levi is a composite of two documents. One source was \"a wisdom apocalypse derived from the exegetical elaboration of Malachi 2:4-7\". The other, based on the same exegesis, \"described Levi's actual initiation into the priesthood by angels\". The narrative frame is based from the Book of Jubilees. The compiler of Aramaic Levi added that the priests would be kings. It is a Hasmonean compilation, 133-100 BCE.\n\nThe \"Testament of Judah\" is primarily concerned with courage, monetary greed, and fornication. It begins by portraying Judah as idealistically courageous, involving bravery in front of wild beasts, as well as successful military expeditions, sometimes basing the narrative on acts that the canonical bible attributes to Jacob. However, it goes on to present a xenophobic focus, criticising his marriage to a non-Israelite, as well as his sexual activity with Tamar, his daughter-in-law who at that time was \"pretending\" to be a prostitute.\n\nThe narrative argues that Judah had sex with Tamar and his wife due to drunkenness, and that he bribed his wife's father in order to be allowed to marry her. It then goes on to instruct that the role of a king is lesser than that of a priest, and that Levi is more important, clearly pointing to the theocratic attitude of the author.\n\nThe \"Testament of Issachar\" predominantly concerns asceticism, which the text portrays as virtuous. The narrative however begins by retelling the biblical tale of Leah's purchase of Jacob's \"nocturnal services\" by the giving of mandrakes to Rachel. Rachel is portrayed as virtuous for being more celibate than the randy Leah.\n\nThe remainder of the narrative portrays Issachar himself as leading a godly and simple agricultural life. This is based on Genesis 49:14-15: Issachar had loved the land such that he \"bent his shoulder to the burden\" and became a tiller for hire. The same exegesis is at work in the Septuagint and Samaritan Targum of Genesis.\n\nZebulun was the sixth son of Leah and Jacob. He is described as an inventor and philanthropist and the text relates what he learned as a result of the plot against Joseph.\n\n\"The copy of the words of Zebulun, which he enjoined on his sons before he died in the hundred and fourteenth year of his life, two years after the death of Joseph.\n2 And he said to them:\nHearken to me, ye sons of Zebulun, attend to the words of your father.\n3 I, Zebulun, was born a good gift to my parents.\n4 For when I was born my father was increased very exceedingly, both in the flocks and herds, when with the straked rods he had his portion.\n5 I am not conscious that I have sinned all my days, save in thought.\n6 Nor yet do I remember that I have done any iniquity, except the sin of ignorance which I committed against Joseph; for I covenanted with my brethren, because they had all agreed that if any one should declare the secret, he should be slain.\"\n\nThe \"Testament of Dan\" treats the topics of anger and lying. The main vice, however, is anger.\n\nDan first explains his feelings of jealousy towards his brother Joseph. The spirit of anger tempted him towards murdering Joseph. Fortunately, the Lord did not deliver Joseph into Dan's hands.\n\nDan then goes on to explain how the spirit of anger works. It covers your eyes, and distorts your vision. Through this you do not recognise people for who they really are. In the case of Joseph, Dan speaks from experience. Furthermore, it disturbs the mind so that the Lord departs from it and Beliar inhabits it.\n\nTherefore, Dan's children should keep the commandments of the Lord, and stay near to the Lord. Dan goes into more depth through a prediction about the future, including one SER (\"Sin-Exile-Return\") and three LJ (\"Levi-Judah\") passages. In this Dan talks of a saviour arising from Levi and Judah that will set the souls free from Beliar.\n\nAgain, Dan reminds his sons to stay near to God, and also to his interceding angel, and the saviour of the Gentiles. If they listen to Dan's warning, then his children will be received by the saviour of the Gentiles and be saved.\n\nThe testament ends with an apparent gloss (inasmuch as one can speak of a gloss in a pseudepigraph), which points out that the prophecies of Dan did indeed happen.\n\nThe \"Testament of Naphtali\" has apocalyptic elements in it. It opens with the genealogy of Bilhah, his mother, whose father is said to be Rotheus. His vision represents Levi seizing the sun and Judah the moon. The young man with the twelve palm branches seems to be a reference to the Apostles. Joseph seizes a bull and rides on it. He has a further dream in which he sees a storm at sea and the brethren being separated. Again there is a reference to the recurrent theme of sexual relation. \n\nA copy of the Testament of Naphtali was discovered at Qumran among the Dead Sea Scrolls taken from Cave 4 (4Q215).\n\nThe Testament of Gad begins with Gad's hatred for Joseph. Chapter 2 begins with Gad talking about loving one another. He says 'and now, my children, I exhort you, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your hearts, love'. The moral of Gad is to not hate one another and love all your brethren.\n\nThe \"Testament of Asher\" is the shortest of the twelve and unlike the others does not begin with a deathbed scene.\nIt is regarding the subject of the two ways to live. The main appeal in Asher is to follow truth with singleness of faith.\n\nThe \"Testament of Joseph\" primarily concerns Chastity, and seems heavily to be based on Joseph's resistance against Potiphar's wife that the canonical bible portrays. The narrative contains a large expansion on the attempts of Potiphar's wife to seduce Joseph, portraying her as first threatening Joseph, then employing torture, then flattering Joseph, then plotting to kill her husband so that Joseph would be able to marry her without bigamy, then using love potions, and finally threatening suicide.\n\nThe \"Testament of Benjamin\" is very much an appendix to that of Joseph. It opens with the account Joseph gave Benjamin of how he was sold to the Ishmaelites. He exhorts his descendants against deceit, but, as all his brethren, he warns them against fornication.\n\nThe Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs contain a substantial amount of prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah. From a Christian perspective, a number of statements can be associated with events in the life of Jesus. Many consider this significant since several of the books are thought to predate Jesus. \n\nFor example, compare the following passages from the Testament of Levi:\n\nThe heavens shall be opened, and from the temple of glory shall come upon him sanctification, with the Father's voice as from Abraham to Isaac. And the glory of the Most High shall be uttered over him, and the spirit of understanding and sanctification shall rest upon him in the water. (Levi 5:21-22)\nwith this passage from the Gospel of Matthew\n\nAs soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" ()\n\nRH Charles called attention to the frequent use of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs by Paul and other writers of the New Testament. In particular:\n\nLater scholarship has highly debated this issue.\n\nA copy of the testaments is published in several works including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1924057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1924057", "title": "2005 Conservative Party leadership election", "text": "2005 Conservative Party leadership election\n\nThe 2005 Conservative Party leadership election was called by party leader Michael Howard on 6 May 2005, when he announced that he would be stepping down as Leader of the Conservative Party in the near future. However, he stated that he would not depart until a review of the rules for the leadership election had been conducted, given the high level of dissatisfaction with the current system. Ultimately, no changes were made and the election proceeded with the existing rules, which were introduced in 1998.\n\nThe contest formally began on 7 October 2005, when the Chairman of the 1922 committee, Michael Spicer, received a letter of resignation from Howard. Nominations for candidates opened immediately, and closed on 13 October.\n\nThe first round of voting amongst Conservative Members of Parliament took place on 18 October and Kenneth Clarke was eliminated (38 votes) leaving David Davis (62 votes), David Cameron (56 votes) and Liam Fox (42 votes) to go through to the second ballot on 20 October. In the second ballot, Fox was eliminated (51 votes), leaving Cameron (90 votes) and Davis (57 votes) to go through to a postal ballot. The ballot, whose result was declared on 6 December, saw Cameron win 68% of votes to Davis' 32%.\n\nThe following candidates declared their intention to seek the leadership, but withdrew before voting began after gathering limited support:\n\nThe first ballot of MPs was held on 18 October. The results were announced, ten minutes later than expected, at 5:30 pm by Sir Michael Spicer, the Chairman of the 1922 Committee.\n<section begin=\"Results\"/>\n<section end=\"Results\"/>\n\n\n\nMuch speculation surrounded the review of the rules, as it is widely estimated that the system eventually adopted could prove a help or hindrance to particular candidates with strong support in certain areas of the party. However, on 27 September 2005, the proposal to change the rules was rejected.\n\nUnder the rules adopted in 1998, under which both Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard were elected, a leadership contest can be initiated either by the incumbent leader resigning or by the Parliamentary Party passing a vote of no confidence in the present leader. The latter is called if 15% of the Parliamentary Party write to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee. If a vote of no confidence is passed, a leadership election is called and the incumbent is barred from standing in it.\n\nThe returning officer is the Chairman of the 1922 Committee. Candidates must be nominated by any two MPs taking the Conservative whip. If only one candidate stands (as happened in the 2003 leadership election) then they are elected \"nem con\" (uncontested).\n\nIf two candidates stand, then the election immediately proceeds to a ballot of all members of the party. If more than two candidates stand, then MPs first hold a series of ballots to reduce the number to two. On each round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. (If two or more candidates tie for last place, as happened in the 2001 contest, then the ballot is repeated, and if the tie remains, all bottom-placed candidates are eliminated.) Candidates may also withdraw between rounds (this also happened in the 2001 contest).\n\nThe series of ballots by MPs continues until there are only two candidates remaining. At this point the all-member ballot begins; this lasts for some weeks. To be eligible to vote, an individual has to have been a paid-up member of the party for at least three months. The candidate who tops the poll is declared leader.\n\nMany criticisms have been made of the rules, in light of some problems encountered in previous elections:\n\n\nMany have criticised the system as having been devised to try to answer those who believed that a leader should have the backing of the bulk of MPs, to answer demands for ordinary party members to have a say, and to allow for the removal of a failing leader.\n\nIt is possible for a candidate to reach the final two with the support of barely a third of MPs in the final ballot (or even less if the rival candidate has overwhelming support in the Parliamentary Party) and then be elected leader by the party members. Conversely, they are then vulnerable to being removed as leader by the MPs.\n\nSome have argued that party members are unrepresentative of the electorate at large and are prone to elect a leader reflecting their views rather than those of the country at large.\n\nFollowing the Conservative Party's defeat at the 2005 general election, in a speech on 6 May 2005, Howard announced his intention to retire as leader of the Conservative Party. However, he indicated that before he stood down he wanted to oversee changes to the Party’s process of electing a new leader. These new proposals were set out in principle in the Conservative Party document \"A 21st Century Party\":\nThis proposal was put to the 1922 Committee on 15 May 2005, but rejected. About 100 of the 180 backbenchers that attended the meeting instead endorsed a motion drawn up by the executive of the committee. The 1922 Committee proposal included a consultative period with all local associations, but the choice of leader would ultimately be decided by the parliamentary party.\n\nUnder the 1922 Committee proposed system, Sir Michael Spicer, Chairman of the 1922 Committee of MPs, would seek nominations for leader from Conservative Members of Parliament. Contenders would need the support of 5% of the party, or 10 MPs (in the current Parliament), in order to stand.\n\nOnce nominations had closed MPs would then start a two-week consultation process with their constituencies, MEPs and local councillors to ascertain their preferred candidates. They would then report back to Sir Michael, who would assess their findings and inform MPs of the two candidates who gained most support, in order of preference.\n\nMPs would then hold the first ballot, in which all nominated candidates would be able to participate. As in the current system the MP with the lowest number of votes would be eliminated. The process would then be repeated, as required, until one candidate remained.\n\nAndrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP for Chichester hailed the decision by the parliamentary party to accept the new proposals, by 127 votes to 50 on 20 July 2005 at a meeting of the 1922 committee, as a \"victory for common sense\".\n\nThe 1922 Committee proposal was then put to the Conservative Party Board which duly supported it. Following this result Party Chairman, Francis Maude commented; \"I am pleased that these changes, agreed by the Party Board and the 1922 Committee, are going to be put forward. If these changes go through, the Conservative Party will have a new Leader in place by the middle of November.\"\n\nHowever, other MPs were less enthusiastic about the new system. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph a number of MPs including David Willetts, Michael Ancram, Andrew Lansley, Theresa May and Iain Duncan Smith, wrote: \"It is not too late for the parliamentary party to find a way of involving grassroots members in the Conservative Party’s most important decisions. Any proposals that do not facilitate democratic involvement deserve to be defeated.\"\n\nWhen the results of the ballot of the Constitutional College of the Conservative Party were announced on 27 September 2005, the proposals had failed to gain enough backing. A total of 1,001 (87.7% of full membership) ballots were returned, the votes in each section were:\n\nThis equated to a total of 61 per cent of the constitutional college in favour. For the changes to be approved, 50 per cent of all those eligible to vote were required to vote in favour, along with 66 per cent of MPs who voted and 66 per cent of the National Convention members who voted, it is this final threshold that was not reached.\n\nAs a result of the Constitutional College ballot, no changes were made to the party’s rules on electing a leader.\n\n\n\nAt the 2005 Conservative Party conference, each of the five announced candidates at the time was allowed a 20-minute speech. This was seen by many as the start of the leadership campaign by each of the candidates and their speeches were closely analysed by party members and the media. Many felt that front-runner (at the time of his speech) David Davis had performed rather poorly, while the speeches of Kenneth Clarke, Liam Fox, Sir Malcolm Rifkind and David Cameron were much better. This led to a rapid change in the odds of the five candidates on the betting markets – on the morning of 6 October, David Davis was the clear leader and David Cameron third, but by the evening of the same day the two had swapped places. By the end of the conference, David Cameron had become the front runner, with Ken Clarke and David Davis closely behind.\n\nThe conference was also seen as similar to the Conservatives' 1963 conference, where there was also a race to become leader.\n\nThe Sunday Times and YouGov polled 746 members of the Conservative Party just after the conference. The poll showed support slipping away from David Davis (14%) and Ken Clarke (26%) and moving to Liam Fox (13%) and David Cameron (39%) instead.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph and YouGov polled 665 members of the Conservative Party just after the first ballot, where Clarke was eliminated leaving only three contestants. The poll showed that 59 percent backed David Cameron, against 18 percent for Liam Fox and 15 per cent for Mr Davis. This poll showed support for Mr Cameron being strong amongst the grassroots of the party on the eve of the final (membership) ballot.\n\nIn a YouGov poll published on 12 November, more than two-thirds of party members looked set to vote for the younger candidate as party leader. Around 68 per cent of voters who had already returned their ballot papers had opted for Mr Cameron, while 66 per cent of those still to vote said they were likely to choose him over the then-Shadow Home Secretary David Davis. 57 per cent of those still to vote said they may change their minds between then and the postal ballot deadline on 5 December.\n\n\n"}

It flows for through Saskatchewan before it merges into the South Saskatchewan River.\n\n\nThe waters of Ewing Lake, Little Fish Lake also flow into the Red Deer River.\n\nSport fish include: northern pike, sauger, lake whitefish,\nyellow perch, burbot, lake sturgeon,\nmountain whitefish, goldeye, brown trout, bull trout, rainbow trout, brook trout, and cutthroat trout.\n\nOther fish include: emerald shiner, river shiner,\nspottail shiner, flathead chub, longnose dace, quillback carpsucker, longnose sucker, \nwhite sucker, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, perch, \nspoonhead sculpine, lake chub,\nnorthern pearl dace, northern redbelly dace, finescale dace, fathead minnow and brook stickleback.\n\nThe Red Deer River is the water source for the City of Red Deer, Alberta and the surrounding area. Pipelines cross under the river and there have been leaks disrupting access to potable water. Increased water flow of the Red Deer River system during heavy rainfall in June 2008 eroded supporting soil, freely exposing a section of Pembina Pipeline Corporation's Cremona crude oil pipeline to the Red Deer River currents. About 75 to 125 barrels of crude oil flowed upstream from the breakpoint under a Red Deer River channel, leaving an oily sheen on Gleniffer Reservoir and 6800 kilograms (15 000 lbs) of oil-soaked debris. The remediation was not completed until 2011.\n\nHeavy rains in early June 2012 caused a similar but larger leak on a Plains Midstream Canada 46-year-old pipeline on a Red Deer River tributary, Jackson Creek, Alberta (51°52'19\" 114°36'23\") near Gleniffer Lake and Dickson Dam, which spilled approximately 1000 and 3000 barrels (160,000-475,000 litres) of light sour crude into the Red Deer River.\n\n"}

From 1981 the studios were run as a commercial operation and were the location for a number of notable rock and pop recordings. Artists who recorded at Eel Pie Studios include Pete Townshend, A-ha, Rachel Fuller and Michael Cuthbert. In the 1990s, the studio was occupied by the band Cocteau Twins, who called it September Sound, and The Lightning Seeds. \n\nPete Townshend sold the studios in 2008 and the building was converted into a private residence.\n\n'Eel Pie' had earlier been used as the name for a series of Pete Townshend's home studios, where he recorded many song demos.

He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers to play for Wales.\n\nJack Kelsey was born at 382 Jersey Road in the Llansamlet area of Swansea, the second of three children born to Alfred Kelsey and his wife Sarah Ann (née Howe). His father hailed from London but had moved to South Wales in 1911 where he worked as a smelter furnaceman. \n\nKelsey attended Cwm School but left at a young age to work alongside his father and qualified as a crane driver.\n\nHe was spotted by an ex-Arsenal player, Les Morris, whilst Kelsey was playing for his local side, Winch Wen, then in the Swansea & District League. Morris recommended Kelsey to Arsenal, who upon watching the goalkeeper for a few games, decided to sign him. Arsenal already had an established first-choice goalkeeper at this time, in George Swindin, so Kelsey could do nothing but wait for his chance to play for the first team.\n\nAfter two years in the reserves, Kelsey made his first-team debut against Charlton Athletic on 24 February 1951 at Highbury, after Swindin had received an injury; However, Kelsey's first start was not an auspicious one, as Arsenal lost 5–2, their heaviest defeat at home since November 1928. Kelsey made a total of four appearances that season, but was dropped once Swindin returned and did not feature in Arsenal's 1951–52 run to the FA Cup final.\n\nAfter an entire season in the reserves, he returned to the side during the 1952–53 season, sharing goalkeeping duties with Swindin and Ted Platt; he made 29 appearances in a side that won the First Division title. With a rugged build and consistently solid catching, Kelsey managed to fully oust Swindin from the side (Swindin making only two appearances in 1953–54) and went on to be Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper for the next eight seasons; only a broken arm sustained in an FA Cup tie against Sheffield United in 1959 put Kelsey out of the Arsenal side for any considerable amount of time, with Jim Standen taking over in the meantime.\n\nAlthough his playing career coincided for the most part with a trophyless run for Arsenal – their best finish being third in 1958–59 – and thus he did not win further honours with them, he is still regarded by the club as one of their greatest-ever goalkeepers. He was also a runner-up in the first Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1958, playing for a London XI representative side against FC Barcelona.\n\nKelsey also became a regular first choice keeper for Wales, making his debut in 1954, winning 41 caps in total. He was Wales's keeper in the 1958 World Cup, their only finals appearance to date. They were eventually knocked out 1–0 by winners Brazil in the quarter-finals. With the help of Kelsey, Wales did not concede a goal for 70 minutes against the Brazilians, until a shot by Pelé deflected off Welsh player Stuart Williams managed to beat Kelsey. Kelsey also played for the Great Britain & Northern Ireland team against a Rest of Europe side in 1955.\n\nKelsey's career was cut short after he sustained a back injury playing for Wales in a friendly against Brazil in May 1962, whilst trying to save at the feet of Vavá; despite many attempts to rectify his injury, he was forced to retire a year later. He received around £5,000 insurance money at the time. In all, he played 352 times for Arsenal, comprising 327 League matches, 24 in the FA Cup and 1 in the Charity Shield.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Kelsey later worked for Arsenal as the club's commercial manager, finally retiring in 1989. He died in Friern Barnet London in 1992, at the age of 62.\n\nKelsey is survived by his two sons, Paul John Kelsey (Born 1958), Peter John Kelsey (Born 1961).\n\nIn September 2010 Kelsey was inducted to the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame.\n"}
